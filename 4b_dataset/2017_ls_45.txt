Abstract
Throughout Victoria’s reign, Lord Lindsay and his son Ludovic, respectively twentyfifth and twenty-sixth earls of Crawford, created one of the largest private libraries
ever assembled in Britain. The Bibliotheca Lindesiana included some six thousand
manuscripts, which Ludovic sold to Enriqueta Rylands in 1901 for £155,000.
The principal problematic that I address in this thesis is: Why did the earls of
Crawford invest vast amounts of financial and cultural capital in this endeavour? In
other words, what factors – both structural and specific – led to the formation of the
library, what purposes did it serve, and what roles did its manuscript components in
particular perform? Other questions include: How – and how successfully – did
Lindsay and Ludovic maintain physical and intellectual control over the rapidly
growing library? How did they position themselves within networks of
connoisseurship and collecting in Victorian Britain? How was the formation of the
Oriental manuscript collections connected with Lindsay’s interest in racial
classification and with wider racial discourses? And how did the library reflect and
reinforce Lindsay’s identity as a gentleman-scholar?
Previous studies of this and other manuscript collections have adhered to an
antiquarian, bio-bibliographical model, focusing on the detailed matter and
mechanisms of collecting, rather than exploring the socio-cultural and
epistemological contexts of their development. This thesis, by contrast, constitutes
the first extended application of cultural theory to a manuscript collection, or
indeed to any private library, in the nineteenth century. I combine close archival
work with Bourdieu’s concepts of field, capital and habitus to reveal the complex
structuration and signification of the library, and to investigate the imbrication
between the earls’ personal agency and wider forces operating upon the library.
My examination of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana has uncovered several key issues and
themes hitherto unexplored in this or any other major private library of the
nineteenth century. First, I argue that the reasons for the library’s development
reside principally in various forms of classification, which preoccupied Lindsay and
reflected wider societal trends and taxonomies: the classification of libraries and the
ramification of knowledge; Lindsay’s deployment of the library to corroborate his
and his family’s social and cultural distinction (i.e. social classification); and an
interest in racial classification, which reflected Orientalist discourses associated
with imperialism.
Secondly, while the dispersal of aristocratic collections in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries is a familiar trope, this study is the first to contextualize
the decline of a private library within the struggle between the aristocracy and the
bourgeoisie. Finally, this is the first examination of the impact of professionalization
upon private as opposed to public libraries, revealing the tensions between amateur
traditions and growing professionalism and specialization in the nineteenth
century. I thus ‘read’ through the library some of the wider socio-economic and
cultural issues operating in Victorian Britain and its empire.

Acknowledgements
During the long course of this exploration into the Bibliotheca Lindesiana, now
spanning eight years, I have inevitably accumulated debts of gratitude to numerous
individuals and institutions without whose invaluable assistance this research
project would not have been possible. It is a pleasant duty to acknowledge these
obligations, whilst accepting sole responsibility for all errors and shortcomings of
this thesis.
I was initially encouraged to consider undertaking a PhD by several colleagues at
the University of Manchester, notably Stephen Milner, Serena Professor of Italian,
and my library colleagues Rachel Beckett, Dr Dorothy Clayton, Elizabeth Gow,
Stella Halkyard, Ed Potten, and Jan Wilkinson, University Librarian and Director of
the John Rylands Library. Professor Milner generously agreed to act as principal
supervisor, despite slender evidence of any research capabilities on my part. He and
the other members of my supervisory team – Dr Guyda Armstrong (Senior Lecturer
in Italian) and David Matthews (Professor of Medieval and Medievalism Studies) –
have provided steadfast support and wise counsel at every step of the way, guiding,
inspiring and occasionally cajoling. My debt to these exceptional scholars and
mentors is immeasurable.
Along the way, I have benefited from the support and advice of numerous
researchers, curators and bibliographical experts at the University of Manchester
and elsewhere. Dr Anindita Ghosh (Senior Lecturer in Modern Indian History)
offered constructive comments and suggestions on an early draft of Chapter 4. I
have been inspired by frequent conversations with my colleague Elizabeth Gow,
who is undertaking a PhD on Enriqueta Rylands as a collector; she has been
generous in sharing her knowledge of the foundation of the John Rylands Library
and of nineteenth-century collecting more generally. Dr Dorothy Clayton and Stella
Halkyard read and perceptively commented upon draft chapters, and both have
provided unstinting encouragement and sage advice throughout the course of the
PhD. I am immensely fortunate to work with such supportive, erudite and engaged
colleagues.

11

I have also profited from stimulating conversations with Dr Peter Nockles, Michael
O’Sullivan, Professor Peter Pormann, Ed Potten, Jeremy Potter, Julianne Simpson
and Dr Tim Underhill, while Dr Malcolm Choat (Macquarie University) and Dr
Roberta Mazza (University of Manchester) have generously shared with me their
expertise in papyrology and specifically in the twenty-sixth earl of Crawford’s
papyrus-hunting. Hugh Brigstocke munificently permitted me to make use of his
extensive investigations into Lord Lindsay as an art collector and critic. John Morris
of Leatherhead kindly supplied an unpublished draft of his biography of the
manuscript collector Nathaniel Bland.
As well as offering a supportive research environment – especially since the
foundation of the John Rylands Research Institute in 2013 – The University of
Manchester Library has also provided financial and practical assistance, in the form
of a subvention towards my fees and grants of research leave, while colleagues in
the Document Supply and Store teams have responded to my frequent requests for
inter-library loans and reserved materials with their customary courtesy and
efficiency.
The considerable financial burden attendant upon a PhD was eased by a generous
gift from the cousins of David W. Riley (1934–2010), a gentle man and former
Keeper of Printed Books at the John Rylands Library, who quietly inspired in me
and other colleagues a love of rare books and libraries. I wish to record my sincere
thanks to Diana Ash, Dr Charles Moseley and Anthea Toynton.
The principal archival source for this study is the Crawford Muniments, held on
deposit at the National Library of Scotland. Since 2009 I have made something like
fifteen research visits to Edinburgh, each extending over several days. On every
occasion, I have been struck by the professionalism and friendliness of the NLS
staff, who have made my visits a genuine pleasure. In particular, I am greatly
indebted to Kenneth Dunn, Manuscript and Archive Collections Manager, who has
freely shared his unparalleled knowledge of the archives, and has gone well beyond
the call of duty in facilitating my access to them with unfailing kindness and
enthusiasm.

12

In the course of this research I have visited or corresponded with many other
archives and libraries, thereby incurring debts of gratitude to numerous individuals,
among whom the following merit special mention: Colin Harris, Superintendent of
the Special Collections Reading Rooms at the Bodleian Library; Patricia Usick,
Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan, the British Museum; Michael Powell and
Fergus Wilde at Chetham’s Library; Grant Buttars, Deputy University Archivist at
Edinburgh University Library; Lee Spilberg in the Manuscripts & Archives Division
of New York Public Library; Alice Ford-Smith, Katherine Spears and Nicholas PooleWilson at Bernard Quaritch Ltd; Jennifer Toews, Modern Manuscripts and
Reference Librarian at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto,
who kindly supplied copies of hundreds of letters from Bernard Quaritch to Lord
Amherst of Hackney; Rachel Jacobs, Curator in the Collection Department,
Waddesdon Manor; and Alex Miller and Stephen Knott at Wigan Archives Service. I
am also grateful to the staff of the British Library, St Pancras; Historic Environment
Scotland (formerly RCAHMS), Edinburgh; the Huntington Library, San Marino;
Lancashire Archives; the National Art Library at the V&A; and Sheffield Archives.
I am particularly indebted to Robert Lindsay, twenty-ninth earl of Crawford and
twelfth earl of Balcarres, for granting me permission to consult the Crawford
Muniments deposited at the National Library of Scotland. Moreover, Lord and Lady
Crawford generously welcomed me to Balcarres House on several occasions, in
order to study and photograph Lord Lindsay’s monumental Library Report. The
warm hospitality I received on each occasion will live long in the memory. Images
of Lindsay and Ludovic, and of the Library Report, are reproduced by kind
permission of Lord Crawford, and I am also grateful to him for permission to quote
extensively from the archives at Balcarres and the NLS.
Anyone who examines the earls of Crawford and their collections is profoundly
obligated to Nicolas Barker, whose magisterial Bibliotheca Lindesiana (1977; 2nd
edition 1978) constitutes one of the most detailed and authoritative studies ever
undertaken of a private library. It has certainly provided the essential context and
guidance for my own research; without it, my investigation of the vast Crawford
archives would have been far more daunting; and Nicolas Barker has generously
permitted me to quote extensively from it. Moreover, with characteristic
13

munificence he unhesitatingly encouraged me to intrude upon what could
justifiably be regarded as his ‘turf’. As my research has advanced, so my admiration
for his achievement has grown, even if the outcome is necessarily different from
Bibliotheca Lindesiana. It is for others to judge whether I have seen further, but my
vision has certainly benefited from standing on the shoulders of a bibliographical
giant.
Thirty years and half a lifetime ago, I almost embarked on a PhD in another
university and in a different field. Courage failed me and I declined the opportunity.
That decision was a source of regret to me and (I suspect) keen disappointment to
my parents. I hope that this doctoral thesis, should it be accepted, will go some way
towards making amends to my mother and father, to whom it is dedicated with
profound thanks for their patience and toleration.

1 Introduction: ‘My present discourse is to be upon Books’ 1

1.1

Incipit

In the years coterminous with Victoria’s reign, Lord Lindsay and his son Ludovic,
respectively twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth earls of Crawford, created one of the
largest private libraries ever assembled in Britain. At its greatest extent, the
Bibliotheca Lindesiana contained over 100,000 items, including some six thousand
Western and Oriental manuscripts which were purchased by Enriqueta Rylands in
1901, to form one of the foundational collections of the recently established John
Rylands Library. Yet the formation of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana has never been
read through the lens of modern cultural theory. Indeed, most previous studies of
manuscript collecting – in the nineteenth century and other periods – have cleaved
to an antiquarian, bio-bibliographical model, narrowly focusing on the subjectmatter and mechanisms of collecting, rather than exploring the socio-cultural and
epistemological contexts of libraries’ development. This is the first large-scale study
of a major nineteenth-century manuscript collection that positions its subject
within a wider landscape, in order to explore how the library and its creators were
impacted by and implicated in societal changes. I reveal the library to be a
remarkable microcosm of Victorian epistemology, bibliophilic sociability, racial
discourses, and aristocratic taste and distinction.
The principal question that I address in this thesis is: Why did Lindsay and Ludovic
invest enormous amounts of financial and cultural capital in this endeavour? In
other words, what factors – both structural and particular to father and son – led to
the formation of the library, what purposes did it serve, and what roles did its
manuscript components perform? Further questions arise from this central
problematic, focusing upon the means by which physical and intellectual control
was maintained over the library; Lindsay’s and Ludovic’s positioning within
networks of connoisseurship and collecting, and within wider knowledge
communities; the connections between the formation of the Oriental manuscript

collections and Lindsay’s interest in racial classification; and the ways in which
Lindsay deployed the library to reflect and reinforce his identity as a gentlemanscholar.
Private libraries were of major importance in the early and mid-nineteenth century,
in a period before public libraries became widespread and when the authority of the
academy was not yet firmly established. The libraries of gentry and scholars (the
two categories intersected) were important sites of bibliophilic sociability and
knowledge formation. However, in the last quarter of the century, the cultural
significance of aristocratic libraries was gradually eroded, reflecting the diminishing
socio-political status and wealth of the peerage. The rise and decline of the
Bibliotheca Lindesiana thus not only manifest the intellectual interests, tastes and
wealth of its creators, but also instantiate wider societal trends.
In order to address the questions outlined above, I have engaged in a close, reflexive
study of the rich extant archives of the earls of Crawford, and in particular Lindsay’s
monumental Library Report, the most detailed exposition by any nineteenthcentury bibliophile of their collecting principles and ambitions. This archival work
has been informed by my own experience as an archivist and by the ‘archival turn’
in the humanities. I have also deployed cultural theory, for the first time in an
extended study of manuscript collecting. In particular, I have applied Pierre
Bourdieu’s concepts of field, capital and habitus to investigate the imbrication
between the earls’ personal agency and wider cultural forces operating upon the
library. I thus ‘read’ through the library some of the wider socio-economic and
cultural issues operating in nineteenth-century Britain and its empire, such as the
bourgeois challenge to the aristocracy’s hegemony, and the development of racial
concepts and Orientalist discourses associated with Britain’s imperial enterprise.

1.2

The Earls of Crawford and the Bibliotheca Lindesiana

Alexander Lindsay (1812‒80), known for most of his life as Lord Lindsay, and his son
(James) Ludovic Lindsay (1847‒1913), twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth earls of
Crawford, fashioned one of the largest and most significant private libraries ever
assembled in Britain. The formation of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana spanned the
seventy years from the Great Reform Act of 1832 to the end of Victoria’s reign, a
16

period of unparalleled technological, economic, political, social and cultural
transformation. At its fullest extent, the library comprised over 100,000 printed
books, tens of thousands of documents and printed ephemera, and six thousand
manuscript codices, scrolls and fragments.
The lives of the earls of Crawford have been amply described by Nicolas Barker and
others, and brief biographical sketches will suffice to contextualize the present
study. 2 Alexander Lindsay’s early years followed aristocratic convention. He entered
Eton in 1825, the year in which his father inherited Haigh Hall near Wigan and the
earldom of Balcarres; thereafter he held the courtesy title of Lord Lindsay. After the
customary aristocratic Grand Tour, he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge,
in 1830. Soon after graduating in 1833, he received a substantial legacy from his
cousin, Lady Mary Crawford. This unexpected fortune, together with an allowance
from his father (ultimately deriving from the family’s coal-mining interests),
provided the funds to indulge his twin passions for Italian art and book collecting,
while he always observed the principle that ‘the great works of public religion and
charity […] have the first claim on the purse of a British nobleman.’ 3 He was also an
ardent antiquary and genealogist: he made exhaustive researches into his family’s

history and it was largely through Lindsay’s tireless efforts that his father’s claim to
the earldom of Crawford was upheld in 1848. In 1846 he married his second cousin
Margaret (‘Min’ or ‘Minnie’), daughter of Lieutenant-General James Lindsay and
Anne Lindsay, both of whom had nurtured his interest in the history of art during
several visits to Italy. The newly-weds took up residence at Dunecht in
Aberdeenshire, on the estate that his father had purchased for them. Lindsay
succeeded as twenty-fifth earl of Crawford and eighth earl of Balcarres upon his
father’s death in December 1869.
Lindsay was a gentleman-scholar who abstained from public office, devoting
himself instead to collecting, bibliographical pursuits and polymathic investigations
into art history, comparative religion, philosophy, ethnology, linguistics and
genealogy; the development of Christian thought and civilization, instantiated
especially in trecento and quattrocento Italy, was a lifelong obsession. He invested
huge amounts of financial capital to expand the much-depleted ancestral library
into a catholic, panoptical repository of ‘the best and most valuable books,
landmarks of thought and progress, in all cultivated languages, Oriental as well as
European’. 4 As a collector his watchwords were discipline and utility, liberally
construed: the library was intended to service his and his family’s literary
requirements, and he was determined to avoid bibliomaniacal excess, preferring
textually superior editions to first editions, ‘rejecting all large-paper copies and
sumptuous bindings, and only admitting the principle of rarity […] where the rare
volumes were indispensable to my scheme on merits independent of that rarity’. 5
He claimed not to be a collector of manuscripts per se, acquiring only
representative examples of illuminated manuscripts and avoiding the obvious
attractions of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Books of Hours and other
bibliophilic baubles.
Non-Western manuscripts, however, were one of the library’s most noteworthy
features. Lindsay assembled major collections of Middle Eastern manuscripts in
Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Samaritan; South Asian manuscripts in Sanskrit and

numerous modern Indian languages; Chinese and Japanese printed books and
manuscripts; and Syriac, Armenian, Coptic and Ethiopic Christian codices. Ludovic
later supplemented these collections and developed extensive holdings of SouthEast Asian manuscripts, collecting a pot-pourri of materials written on palm-leaf,
bamboo, bone, bark and copper. Another innovation was Ludovic’s enthusiasm for
fragments of ancient papyrus from Egypt. Thus when Enriqueta bought the
collection for £155,000 in 1901, 3,093 Oriental printed books and manuscripts were
transferred to Manchester, plus several thousand papyri, in comparison to just 475
Western manuscripts (see Appendix 5).
Lindsay’s later years were marred by ill-health, and he died at his beloved Villa
Palmieri in Florence on 13 December 1880, whereupon his son inherited the
earldom and responsibility for the library. Ludovic, like his father, was educated at
Eton and Trinity, although he spent only a year at Cambridge before joining the
Grenadier Guards. In 1869 he married Emily Florence (‘Emmie’), daughter of Hon.
Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, second son of the first Baron Skelmersdale. He was a
keen scientist in an era when amateurs could still make significant contributions to
knowledge: he established an impressive observatory at Dunecht and was elected
president of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1878 and 1879. Ludovic served as MP
for Wigan from 1874 until 1880, and he held numerous public offices. He became a
keen yachtsman later in life, undertaking expeditions around the world to collect
scientific and natural history specimens for the British Museum, of which he was
appointed a trustee in 1885; his philatelic collection became one of the foundation
stones of the Museum’s holdings.
Lindsay had cultivated his son’s interest in the library from a young age, and
Ludovic’s first major contribution was to secure the mathematical collection of
Charles Babbage in 1873. However, as a collector he was quite unlike his father: a
man of action, impulsive in his acquisitions, and eclectic in his tastes. He was fond
of jewelled bindings, early manuscripts from Visigothic Spain and the empires of
Charlemagne and his successors, and spectacular illuminated manuscripts. Ludovic
also developed the library in new directions: in addition to South-East Asian
manuscripts and papyri, he assembled a vast collection of French Revolutionary and
Napoleonic décrets, proclamations, periodicals, newspapers and autograph
19

documents – the largest outside the Bibliothèque Nationale – building upon a
nucleus formed by his father, as well as English royal proclamations and Civil War
tracts. 6 Ludovic also initiated major campaigns to catalogue the collections. Despite
the disposal of the cream of the printed collections in 1887 and 1889, and the sale of
the manuscripts to Enriqueta Rylands in 1901, his son could still claim in 1917 that
the Bibliotheca Lindesiana was the greatest private library in the British Empire. 7
Ludovic’s eldest son, David (1871‒1940), succeeded as twenty-seventh earl of
Crawford in 1913, having previously held the courtesy title of Lord Balcarres. He was
elected Conservative MP for Chorley in 1895 and held several junior government
and party positions over the next thirty years. Bal’s principal contributions to public
life were in the arts, as a trustee of the British Museum, National Gallery and
National Portrait Gallery, chairman of the National Art Collections Fund and Royal
Fine Arts Commission, president of the Society of Antiquaries and the Roxburghe
Club, and chancellor of the University of Manchester. During his hegemony, he
oversaw further contractions of the library, in response to the burden of taxation
and the family’s declining economic fortunes. Many of the French Revolution
collections joined the manuscripts at the John Rylands Library, while Quaritch
disposed of fifty-three tons of books. 8

Previous Studies of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana and the Wider
Literature

The Bibliotheca Lindesiana was the subject of a magisterial study by the eminent
book historian and bibliographer, Nicolas Barker, first published in 1977. Barker
successfully assimilated an astonishing quantity of information from the tens of
thousands of documents in the Crawford archives, fashioning this mass of data into
a coherent biographical-cum-bibliographical history, which traces the evolution of

the library from Lindsay’s schoolboy bibliomania in the 1820s through to its breakup in the early twentieth century.
Bibliotheca Lindesiana was commissioned by David Lindsay, twenty-eighth earl of
Crawford, for presentation to fellow members of the Roxburghe Club. It is thus
situated within a long tradition of bibliographical and antiquarian studies, rooted in
empiricism and connoisseurship, and it conforms to the conventions of Roxburghe
publications: the text is written in a discursive style, referencing is incomplete, and
there is no bibliography. Barker assumes that his readers will share his
encyclopaedic knowledge of book history, presenting countless allusive
bibliographical references with studied ease. Likewise, he reflects his audience’s
patrician view of history: while Bibliotheca Lindesiana is certainly no hagiography,
any criticisms of his patron’s forebears and their peers are restrained. The
Roxburghe context also explains Barker’s eschewal of critical theory and theories of
collecting, though elsewhere he has made significant contributions to debates on
methodologies of book history. 9
Bibliotheca Lindesiana has provided essential context and steadfast guidance for my
own studies of the Crawford archives. Nevertheless, I have adopted a more
analytical, theorized and necessarily focused approach than Barker, contextualizing
the earls’ manuscript collections within nineteenth-century book collecting, and
employing the wealth of socio-cultural and collecting theories that have developed
since the mid-1970s.
Other scholars have examined particular elements of the Crawford manuscripts:
Frank Taylor supplemented M. R. James’s catalogue of the Latin manuscripts with
updated citations and additional provenance information; J. F. Coakley has
discussed the provenance and subsequent fates of the Syriac manuscripts; Stephen
Emmel has analysed the Coptic collection; and Peter Kornicki is one of the few
researchers who have contextualized the acquisition of elements of the library – in

this case the Japanese books – within wider epistemological and socio-cultural
landscapes. 10
The historiography of Lindsay’s collecting activities exemplifies traditional
disciplinary boundaries between bibliographical and art-historical studies. The art
historian Hugh Brigstocke has addressed Lindsay’s activities as an art collector in
two extended articles grounded in a close reading of the archives and Lindsay’s
published writings. 11 Like Barker, he adopts a connoisseurial stance, concentrating
on Lindsay’s taste, the mechanisms of his collecting, and the provenance and
attribution of individual artworks. In fact, no study of Lindsay has successfully
synthesized and reconciled his activities as a collector of art as well as of books and
manuscripts. Even the catalogue of a major exhibition of paintings, applied art and
manuscripts acquired by Lindsay, staged at the National Gallery of Scotland in
2000, largely treats these collections as discrete entities: introductory essays by
Brigstocke and Barker discuss the art collections and library respectively, while the
catalogue proper is compartmentalized into paintings, applied art, and
manuscripts. 12

Rowan Watson have provided a detailed analysis of the cultural significance of
manuscript illumination in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe and
twentieth-century America. 13 However, while they consider the socio-cultural
contexts of manuscript collecting, they adopt an art-historical approach, focusing
upon illuminated codices, leaves and cuttings while overlooking textual
manuscripts, and their references to the wider social and epistemological
landscapes are slanted towards the visual arts. Specific aspects of manuscript
collecting have also been the subject of recent articles by Roger Wieck, David
Pearson, Richard Linenthal and Edward Morris. 14
Almost all previous studies of nineteenth-century manuscript collecting adhere to
an antiquarian, bio-bibliographical model. Sir Thomas Phillipps (1792‒1872), ne plus
ultra of manuscript collectors, was the subject of Tim Munby’s pioneering fivevolume Phillipps Studies (1951‒60), later abridged by Nicolas Barker as Portrait of an
Obsession. 15 Other monograph-length studies include Christopher de Hamel’s
investigation into the superlative manuscripts of the various branches of the
Rothschild dynasty, and Donald Kerr’s biography of the colonial administrator and
collector, Sir George Grey (1812‒98). 16 The manuscript collecting practices of

multi-faceted lives. 17 Most other nineteenth-century manuscript collectors,
however, have received far less critical attention. Seymour de Ricci’s synoptic

25

An important aspect of my research is to contextualize the earls of Crawford in
relation to other collectors, and this secondary literature has yielded valuable data
on the tastes and techniques of fellow bibliophiles. However, the emphasis of these
works – and of studies of elite libraries more generally – is frequently upon the
detailed content of the collections (especially the ‘high spots’), while the collectors
themselves remain shadowy figures, their backgrounds and motivations elided.
Moreover, the socio-cultural contexts of manuscript collecting are routinely
ignored: scholars rarely address the social, cultural and epistemological functions of
manuscripts in the modern era, or investigate the place of manuscripts within larger
libraries.
Failure to embrace cultural theory has arguably led to the neglect and
marginalisation of manuscript studies within the academy, in comparison with
other forms of material culture. The field is under-theorized and tainted with
connotations of antiquarianism and connoisseurship, scholarship focusing
predominantly upon the provenance, attribution, materiality, and textual and visual
elements of specific manuscripts. The problem has been compounded by the
hybridity of manuscripts themselves: they are situated at the confluence of arthistorical and textual (literary and historical) studies, and do not neatly conform to
modern disciplinary structures and boundaries.
Nevertheless, more theoretically-informed approaches to bibliographical studies
have emerged in recent years, particularly centred upon reading practices and the
networks of sociability enfolding individual books and collections. Robert Darnton
was one of the first scholars to advocate more theorized, expansive and socially
sensitive methods of book history. His communications circuit, ‘a general model for
analyzing the way books come into being and spread through society’, was
subsequently refined by Thomas Adams and Nicolas Barker, both to include within
the circuit the survival of books and explicitly to recognize the ‘whole socioeconomic conjuncture’ within which books are situated. 28 More recently, Mark

Towsey has undertaken a detailed investigation of Scottish libraries as foci of
reading practices and sociability during the Scottish Enlightenment. 29 Similarly
Edward Potten has drawn attention to the scholarly neglect of private libraries in
the post-bibliomaniac era, advocating ‘a concerted effort to identify and research
libraries associated with a wider social and economic demographic’. 30 These studies
have confirmed my determination to pursue a more theorized approach in my own
research, blending a close reading of the archives and manuscripts with the
adoption of socio-cultural theory.
Very few studies of nineteenth-century book collecting hitherto have adopted the
theoretical methodologies advocated by the preceding critics. Kevin Dettmar
employs a Bourdieusian approach in his study of Victorian gentlemen’s libraries,
arguing for the petit-bourgeois commodification of literary culture in the
nineteenth century. 31 Meghan Hughes introduces her MA thesis on book collecting
in New Zealand with a detailed review of Bourdieu’s concepts, although she is not

empirical analysis. 32 Despite their limitations, these Bourdieu-inspired texts
demonstrate the benefits of applying socio-cultural theories to studies of book and
manuscript collecting; they have informed my own research methodology (outlined
presently), while warning against the superficial application of Bourdieusian
concepts and terminology. 33

Research Problematics and their Importance

The principal question that this thesis addresses is: why did Lindsay, and later his
son, invest immense amounts of financial and cultural capital to create one of the
greatest private libraries in Britain, which eclipsed all but the largest institutional
libraries? More specifically, why did they assemble one of the most significant
collections of manuscripts in Britain? The Bibliotheca Lindesiana was not the
product of historical accident, whim or unthinking, habitual collecting behaviours:
its development involved expenditure of £135,000 between 1851 and 1900, an outlay
of incalculable intellectual effort and time by Lindsay, and the employment of a
cohort of professional librarians by the turn of the century. 34 This colossal
investment, sustained over seventy years, demands explanations located not only in
the characters, motivations and personal circumstances of the earls of Crawford but
also within wider socio-cultural and epistemological contexts. In particular, I shall
investigate both the role that the library performed in reinforcing the Lindsay
family’s distinction, at a time when the hegemony of the aristocracy was threatened
by a burgeoning bourgeoisie, and the position of the library within wider
communities and networks of knowledge. 35

A series of further enquiries arises from this central research question. What
specific functions did the manuscripts perform and how closely assimilated were
they with the rest of the library, which predominantly comprised printed material?
How – and how successfully – did Lindsay and Ludovic maintain physical and
intellectual control over this rapidly growing library? How did father and son
position themselves within networks (both formal and informal) of connoisseurship
and collecting in Victorian Britain? What role did booksellers such as Bernard
Quaritch play in the development of the library, potentially problematizing
assumptions over the earls’ principal agency in this enterprise? How was the
formation of the Oriental manuscript collections connected with Lindsay’s interest
in racial classification and with wider racial discourses? How did the library reflect
and reinforce Lindsay’s identity as a gentleman-scholar? And how did Ludovic differ
from Lindsay in his motivations for and mechanisms of collecting and in his
engagement with bibliophilic networks?
These questions have not previously been asked of the earls of Crawford and their
library, or indeed of any other nineteenth-century manuscript collectors. The
originality of this thesis thus lies in its situating the Bibliotheca Lindesiana within
the wider socio-cultural and epistemological topography, interrogating it through
the prism of modern cultural theory to reveal its broader significance in Victorian
society and knowledge communities. This innovative methodology has major
implications for wider manuscript studies and for the study of private libraries, to
which I shall return in the Conclusion.
Traditional manuscript studies have tended to overlook the after-life of
manuscripts, concentrating instead on the circumstances of their production and
originary purpose, with detailed analyses of their texts and of their codicological,
paratextual and decorative elements. 36 However, the Crawford manuscripts, like
other manuscript collections, are the product of a deliberate and repeated process

of selection and fashioning; they are not transparent windows onto the past, but are
inflected by the tastes, interests, wealth and status of successive owners. I contend
that our appreciation of any manuscript’s significance is deepened by an
understanding of the circumstances of its later survival and custody, its after-life.
This requires more than the compilation of a roll-call of owners: we need to
understand how and why the manuscript was successively acquired, and its
signification for and use by each owner. The present thesis contributes to this
endeavour, enriching our understanding of the Crawford manuscripts.
Moreover, as I noted in the preceding section, previous studies of this and other
elite libraries in the nineteenth century have focused on the mechanisms of
collecting and on the contents of the libraries, to the extent of providing detailed
enumerations of their components. Such bibliographical studies provide valuable
data for investigations into the reception of a particular text or corpus, as well as the
life-histories of specific copies of books and manuscripts, but they frequently fail to
examine why such libraries were developed or what roles they enacted.
Private libraries performed important socio-cultural and epistemological functions
in the early and middle decades of the nineteenth century, in a period before public
libraries became firmly developed and when the authority of the academy was not
yet entrenched. In the last quarter of the century, the influence of aristocratic
libraries began gradually to diminish, as public and academic libraries expanded,
mirroring the erosion of the aristocracy’s socio-cultural and economic influence in
the face of an increasingly powerful bourgeoisie and the concomitant growth of the
academy, especially in provincial cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool
and Leeds. 37 New collectors – bankers and industrialists – entered the market for

capital. 38 Combining cultural theory with close reading of the archive has enabled
me to examine this socio-cultural context of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana, as well as
the rich complexity of its internal structuration and signification.

My Response: Reflexivity and Methodologies

My interest in the Bibliotheca Lindesiana developed from a professional
responsibility for managing the former Crawford manuscripts, which are now
located at the John Rylands Library. Curiosity about their provenance developed
into a determination to comprehend their life-histories and, in particular, the
circumstances of their acquisition and stewardship by the earls of Crawford, in
order more effectively to support researchers and fulfil my curatorial duties.
This thesis is doubly self-serving. First, while the professional and academic benefits
that accrue from a doctorate are not a major motivation for me, it would be
disingenuous to deny their existence. Secondly, in investigating collections for
which I have curatorial responsibility, I am susceptible to accusations of a conflict
of interest and lack of objectivity: there is a clear incentive to overestimate the
collections and thereby corroborate my own position and the standing of my
institution, just as Lindsay deployed the library to confirm and enhance his
distinction.
I have therefore generally eschewed potentially self-interested assessments of the
significance of the material, addressing instead the earls’ motivations for developing
the library, its internal organization, and the external influences acting upon it.
However, I question whether Arnoldian disinterestedness and detachment are
either achievable or desirable. 39 The paradigm of objectivity was long ago

England’, in The Organisation of Knowledge in Victorian Britain, ed. Martin Daunton

dethroned, as Hayden White has explicated in the field of historiography. 40
Bourdieu advocates instead a reflexive sociology, in which researchers recognize
their own objective positions both in relation to the subject under investigation and
within the intellectual and academic field. 41 It therefore behoves me, as a first step
towards reflexivity, to declare myself as a white, middle-aged, middle-class, male
archivist/manager working in an academic library and professionally responsible for
the subject matter of investigation, and as a newly-minted researcher situated (like
Lindsay) on the periphery of the academic field, and indeed crossing disciplinary
boundaries. While my background is the antithesis of Lindsay’s – my Victorian
ancestors laboured in the collieries and cotton mills of Lancashire – I can identify
with his collecting instincts, his bibliophilia and dedication to the ameliorative
function of libraries, and his catholic intellectual interests founded upon a classical
education.
As a Lancastrian, I also have a parochial interest in the Bibliotheca Lindesiana,
whose development was funded by the earls’ income from the Wigan Coal and Iron
Company, and which was later translated to Manchester, courtesy of the vast wealth
generated by the Rylands cotton enterprise. The history of the collection bears
witness to the industrial might, wealth and confidence of Victorian Lancashire, as
well as to socio-geographic tensions between the growth of an urban mercantileindustrial bourgeoisie, an aristocracy whose traditional economic and social bases
were predominantly rural (albeit Haigh Hall was subject to encroachment from
industries sponsored by the earls of Crawford themselves), and increasingly
dominant metropolitan influences. The collection’s twenty-mile journey from

Wigan to Manchester in 1901 thus instantiates a major cultural and societal
reconfiguration from the landed aristocracy to new civic elites.

As noted earlier, I have adopted a methodological approach quite different from
previous studies of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana and of the wider field of book and
manuscript collecting in the nineteenth century. This study is based upon a close,
reflexive reading of the extant archives, combined with selective deployment of
modern cultural theories, notably Bourdieu’s interconnected concepts of field,
capital (especially cultural capital) and habitus.
The evidence for this investigation lies principally in the now-dispersed collections
of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana and in their archival traces: the extensive Crawford
Library Papers, now housed at the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh, and
Lindsay’s Library Report, which remains in the family’s possession at Balcarres
House in Fife. A detailed assessment of these remarkable sources is provided below.
Other material relating to the Wigan Coal & Iron Company and to the Haigh Hall
estate is located at Wigan Archives Service in Leigh, and at Lancashire Archives in
Preston. Previous studies based upon the Crawford archives have not taken into
consideration their partiality and silences, nor have they been informed by the
‘archival turn’ in the humanities and recent cultural theory. For comparative
purposes, I have mined the archives of other manuscript collectors such as William
Tyssen-Amherst, Thomas Brooke and William Bragge; these investigations have
inevitably been conditioned by my own training and experience as a professional
archivist.
Bourdieu’s manifold contributions to philosophy, anthropology, sociology and
cultural studies across several decades have been extensively discussed by
numerous critics, and it is neither necessary nor feasible to summarize his work
here. 42 It is, however, imperative to establish the relevance and benefits of
Bourdieu’s methods for my research.

The best summaries are Pierre Bourdieu: Key Concepts, ed. Michael Grenfell (Durham:

Bourdieu has proved essential in two key respects. First, through the concept of
habitus (which he variously defines as ‘a system of lasting, transposable dispositions
which, integrating past experiences, functions at every moment as a matrix of
perceptions, appreciations, and actions’, or ‘the feel for the game […] the social game
embodied and turned into a second nature’), 43 he seeks to transcend the
dichotomies between individual agency and social structure, and between
objectivist (structuralist) and subjectivist (phenomenological) methodologies. 44
Habitus is shaped by one’s education, upbringing and class background, but not in
a deterministic manner; it disposes one to behave in particular ways within
particular fields or social circumstances – to occupy certain positions within a field
where one’s habitus is finely attuned to the rules of the game, to be a ‘fish in water’
– but it does not mechanistically determine behaviour. 45 People do not act like
structuralist automata, hostages to their class, upbringing and environment.
Habitus thus mediates between agency and environment. In the case of the
Bibliotheca Lindesiana, the personal agency of Lindsay and Ludovic was of course
extremely important, as this thesis will demonstrate, but the formation of the
library was not an inevitable consequence of the earls’ class and upbringing.
Instead, the reasons for the development of the library must be sought in the
confluence of both the earls’ characters and interests and wider socio-cultural
circumstances. Bourdieu argues that the ‘subject’ of the production of an artwork
(or, in this case, a library) is not the maker who physically creates it, but the entire

Sage, 2000); and, more critically, Richard Jenkins, Pierre Bourdieu, revised edn (London:
Routledge, 2002).

set of agents engaged in the field. 46 It is thus vital to acknowledge others’ agency in
the library’s development – the role of fellow collectors, booksellers and scholars –
and to locate the library within the wider social, cultural, epistemological and
economic contexts in which it functioned. I shall show how fellow collectors and
bibliophiles, librarians, booksellers and others helped to shape the library.
The second, and related, way in which my research has benefited from Bourdieu’s
methodologies is through his intensive investigations of the mutually reinforcing
associations between the acquisition of cultural goods, taste, classification and
distinction. Bourdieu argues that taste, far from being intrinsic and natural, is an
arbitrary signifier inculcated through family background and education, and that it
serves to reinforce and reproduce social inequalities. ‘Social subjects, classified by
their classifications, distinguish themselves by the distinctions they make.’ 47 Tastes
for fine wines, classical music, Old Master paintings, or indeed rare books and
manuscripts, cannot be acquired easily or cheaply: major investments of time and
money are required. These ‘refined’ tastes, and the associated accumulation of
luxury or cultural goods, function to mark out the possessor as a person of
distinction, someone with superior cultural capital, whereas they are denied to
subordinates. 48 In the case of the earls of Crawford, I shall argue that the library was
intentionally constructed to reinforce their social and cultural distinction, in a
period when the aristocracy was being challenged by an emergent bourgeoisie, and
that it exemplified their elevated taste.

Although Bourdieusian methods have been central to my research, it must be
admitted that nineteenth-century manuscript collecting did not constitute an
autonomous field according to Bourdieu’s definition of the term: ‘a separate social
universe having its own laws of functioning independent of those of politics and the
economy’. 49 Rather, manuscript collecting was situated at the conjunction of the
wider literary and artistic fields (themselves components of the field of cultural
production), and the agents, commodities, mechanisms and ‘laws’ of manuscript
collecting were subsets of these larger fields. Manuscripts were traded and collected
as part of a larger market for antiquarian books; I am not aware of any dealer or
collector who specialised exclusively in manuscripts. Consequently, it is not
possible to undertake a classic Bourdieusian field analysis, mapping the relative
locations of positions and players within the field. Nonetheless, it is clear that the
earls of Crawford were dominant players, alongside the likes of the earl of
Ashburnham and William Tyssen-Amherst, whereas minor collectors such as
Thomas Joyce (encountered in Chapter 5) were relatively subordinate. In fact, I shall
contend that Bourdieu’s binary division of fields into dominant and dominated
classes, or class fractions, risks oversimplifying complex, fluid positions within the
(loosely defined) field of manuscript collecting. For example, an elite dealer such as
Quaritch could be dominant in certain contexts, such as auctions, yet he was
inferior to his aristocratic clients in others. I shall also suggest, contra Bourdieu,
that some elite collectors such as the Rothschilds were dominant because their
social and political capital was relatively weak; they used deluxe manuscripts and
rare books to reinforce their precarious social standing. Nevertheless, Bourdieu’s
concepts of habitus, capital and field are powerful tools for analysing the terrain of
manuscript collecting and the networks of collectors, dealers and experts with
which the earls of Crawford engaged.
I have made selective use of other theorists throughout my research. Jacques
Derrida’s Archive Fever has been especially enlightening on the power inscribed in
archives such as the Crawford Papers, problematizing their impartiality and truthclaims. 50 Michael Foucault provides valuable insights into the relationship between
49

knowledge, classification and power, which are particularly relevant to the
Bibliotheca Lindesiana, given Lindsay’s abiding interest in the classification of
knowledge, and his overt intention that the library should reinforce his family’s and
the aristocracy’s social and political influence. 51 Foucault’s exploration of the
panopticon also affords a useful metaphor for considering Lindsay’s project to
create a universal library encompassing ‘the best that is known and thought in the
world’. 52
Walter Benjamin’s short essay ‘Unpacking my Library’ has particular relevance for
this study of the earls of Crawford as collectors: he offers a remarkably sensitive
analysis of collectors’ intellectual and emotional investment in their libraries, and
explores issues such as the mechanics of collecting and the polarities of order and
chaos. It is also a text which has influenced later theorists such as Jean Baudrillard
and Susan Stewart. 53 Baudrillard’s For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign
provides one of the most perceptive analyses of auctions ever written, and is
particularly pertinent to Lindsay’s and Ludovic’s activities in the salerooms. 54

Since the study of nineteenth-century book and manuscript collecting remains
under-theorized, I have borrowed methodologies from the more conceptually
advanced field of collecting studies, whose gaze has predominantly fixed upon the
collection of artworks, applied art, anthropological artefacts and other ‘collectibles’.
The writings of Susan Stewart and Susan Pearce have been particularly enlightening
on the psychological aspects of collecting. 55 The former’s profound reflections on
objects of desire, particularly souvenirs, afford insights into Ludovic’s collecting of
exotic manuscripts. Pearce explores the social and psychological functions of
collecting and gift-exchange, arguing for the active role of objects in perpetuating
ideological structures and shaping identities. Her distinction between three modes
of collecting – souvenir, fetishistic and systematic – is apposite to Lindsay’s
(predominantly systematic) and Ludovic’s (principally souvenir) collecting
practices. Likewise, Arjun Appadurai reveals how objects operate within social
contexts; in particular, he explores the role that luxury goods, such as illuminated
manuscripts, perform as ‘incarnated signs’. 56
Studies of individual collectors have often been influenced by Freudian
psychoanalysis, in which collecting is treated as aberrant behaviour practised to
alleviate collectors’ anxiety, self-doubt and depression, which are often rooted in
traumatic childhood experiences. Freud himself referred to the collector ‘who
directs his surplus libido onto the inanimate objective: love of things’. 57 Many
collectors are stimulated by the tension between the order they impose on their
collection and the chaos of the outside world, which continually threatens to
intrude: whenever they admit new objects into the structured domain of the

collection, they risk importing some of that external anarchy and casting the
collection into disarray; but, by successfully incorporating this new material,
putting it ‘in its place’, and restoring orderliness to the collection, they reassert
control over their material possessions and, through this fort-da (‘gone… there’)
game, they (temporarily) satisfy their need for self-affirmation. 58 Werner
Muensterberger offers perceptive insights into the motivations of living collectors,
but his and others’ retrospective psychoanalytical studies of earlier figures are
vitiated by lack of evidence and by their elision of the specific historical contexts of
collecting practices. 59 In the case of the earls of Crawford, there is insufficient
evidence with which to develop a retrospective psychoanalytical study of their
collecting and organization of books and manuscripts, although we know that
Lindsay was cruelly bullied at Eton. 60 Nevertheless, Muensterberger offers incisive
observations on the competitive arena of auction-rooms; combined with
Appadurai’s concept of ‘tournaments of value’ and Baudrillard’s ‘crucible of the
interchange of values’, they help to explain the role of auctions in the development
of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana.

and disciplinarity by Amanda Anderson and Joseph Valente, Peter Burke, Martin

fundamental – and possibly the most fundamental – explanation of collecting.’ G. Thomas

principle in their lives.’ Pearce, On Collecting, p. 237. Baudrillard compares the ‘recycling’ of

explosion of knowledge and the increasing complexity of capitalist society. 61
Bourdieu has been criticized for disregarding the embodied mechanisms by which
networks are formed and sustained; he was concerned with objective relations,
rather than concrete intersubjective relations. 62 My analysis in Chapter 3 of the
cultural networks in which the earls of Crawford operated seeks to reconcile an
empirical, microanalytical approach, rooted in a close reading of the archives, with
Bourdieu’s concept of structured, hierarchical fields. I have been particularly
inspired by Alison Rukavina’s recent study of the international book trade in the
late nineteenth century. She combines Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘rhizomatic’
(‘acentered, nonhierarchical, non-signifying’) model of cultural development with
Werner and Zimmermann’s concept of histoire croisée, or ‘entangled history’, to
produce a complex and fluid social network model, in which ‘every node is
potentially a centre; in other words, there is no periphery in a network’. 63 Rukavina

argues that this ‘allows for the complexity of interactions between agents to play
out without prescribing the nature of the relations between agents and
predetermining the direction of a book’s movement’. 64 Of course, the present study
focuses on one aristocratic collection and thus differs markedly from Rukavina’s
expansive survey of the international book trade, and I am fully aware that the field
of manuscript collecting was highly stratified, with relatively dominant and
dominated players. Nonetheless, I contend that a social network model, which
mitigates the effects of subjectivist and comparativist approaches, is germane to an
analysis of Lindsay’s position within the wider literary-artistic fields, and to studies
of book collecting more generally. It facilitates (and requires) a de-centred,
panoramic perspective of Lindsay’s situation within multiple, imbricated networks
and reduces the risk of merely reinforcing his inherently privileged position.
In Chapter 4 I have made extensive use of postcolonial theory. Edward Said’s model
of the mutually reinforcing association of academic Orientalism and imperialism
(defined by him as ‘the practice, the theory, and the attitudes of a dominating
metropolitan centre ruling a distant territory’) remains enormously influential and
has particular relevance for this thesis. 65 However, in the decades since the
publication of Orientalism, Benedict Anderson, Homi Bhabha, John Ganim, John
McLeod, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and many others have developed more
nuanced approaches, questioning the coherence of the Orientalist project,
exploring the complex interactions within the colonial ‘contact zone’ and exposing
indigenous resistances to – and complicities with – Western engagements with the
East. 66

This investigation of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana is necessarily circumscribed by the
strict parameters of a PhD thesis. I have therefore adopted a selective approach,
choosing four key themes, which function metonymically in lieu of a more
comprehensive study of the library. First, I reveal how the library’s internal
organization and classification were informed by Lindsay’s interest in the
classification of knowledge and the history of libraries, and how the ordering of the
library was influenced by contemporary concerns over information overload.
Secondly, I examine Lindsay’s and Ludovic’s formal and informal relationships with
fellow collectors and others who informed the development of the library; in other
words, their classification of themselves as collectors. Thirdly, I investigate the degree
to which Lindsay’s collecting of oriental materials reflected his interest in racial
classification. Finally, I explore Lindsay’s use of the library to construct his identity
and distinction as a gentleman of taste and erudition, and his explicit objective to
deploy the library to educate his family and support the role of the aristocracy as a
bastion of society; that is, the library’s role in social classification. In short, I contend
that explanations for the development of the library lie substantially in these
various forms of classification.

As well as revealing the fecund intrications and significations of the library and
Lindsay’s thickly connected interests in classification, I explore the imbrication
between the earls’ personal agency and wider forces operating upon the library. I
thus employ the library as a lens through which to examine some of the wider
socio-economic and cultural issues operating in nineteenth-century Britain and its
empire, notably: the ramification and professionalization of knowledge and
attendant anxieties over ‘information overload’; the contestation of gentlemanly
status and erosion of the aristocracy’s economic, social and cultural influence in the
face of an increasingly confident and powerful bourgeoisie; and the development of
racial concepts and Orientalist discourses associated with British imperialism.
I have excluded from my research certain aspects of the library and of Lindsay’s
activities as a collector, in order to maintain a suitably tight delineation to this
thesis. Lindsay’s profound faith was a formative influence upon the development of
the library. I have not addressed this issue directly, but it is implicit throughout the
thesis, as the numerous references to Lindsay’s interest in the development of
Christian thought and civilization, the emphasis on religion and theology in the
Library Report (as well as in his published writings), and his self-representation as a
Christian gentleman, all bear witness. As with so many other aspects of Victorian
society, the building of the library was deep-dyed in Christianity, and further
investigation of Lindsay’s theology would facilitate a fuller comprehension of the
library.
Lindsay devoted scarcely less energy to collecting art than he did to books and
manuscripts. His activities in this sphere have been extensively considered by
Brigstocke, and I have therefore disregarded them. However, it should be noted that
Lindsay’s interest in classification extended into the history of art, as the
classification of the various schools in Sketches of the History of Christian Art
witnesses. This is a subject that warrants further investigation and, as I noted above,
a wider study synthesizing all Lindsay’s collecting activities is long overdue.
I have also largely ignored the economic context of the library’s development. The
Lindsay family’s principal source of income in the nineteenth century was the
Wigan Coal and Iron Company, in the running of which Lindsay was actively
involved. In future I hope to determine whether there was any correlation between
43

the Lindsay family’s expenditure on the library and their income from dividends
and mining royalties, as well as to investigate further their ambivalent attitude to
trade.
Finally, I do not discuss here Ludovic’s later enthusiasms for collecting autographs,
broadsides and French Revolutionary material, nor have I explored in detail the
motives and context for his sale of the manuscripts to Enriqueta Rylands in 1901. I
shall consider potential avenues for further research in the Conclusion.

Thesis Outline

The thesis is organized into four substantive chapters, each of which addresses a
key aspect of the library and its problematics. Chapter 2 investigates how Lindsay
confronted the challenges of establishing and maintaining control over a rapidly
expanding library, contextualizing his endeavours within the wider epistemological
and organizational landscapes of the nineteenth century. He had an abiding interest
in the classification of libraries, which he articulated through the Library Report
and other projects. I examine the principles and practices by which he organized a
vast library that constantly threatened to overwhelm him, situating them within a
genealogy – or meta-classification – of classification schemes and the organization
of knowledge from the sixteenth century onwards. I also explore the extent to
which Lindsay’s library classification reflected and indeed corroborated his
preoccupations with social and racial distinctions. Likewise, Ludovic’s endeavours
to reorganize the library and his appointment of a full-time librarian are positioned
within the context of the professionalization of libraries in the late nineteenth
century. I also investigate the physical and intellectual positioning of manuscripts
within the library, revealing that their ambiguous status and Lindsay’s ambivalent
attitude towards them led to their occupying a liminal position within the
impermanent ‘Museum’ department of the library. However, as the manuscript
collections grew, they eventually precipitated out from the printed books to form
discrete sections of the library.
The Bibliotheca Lindesiana was a site of knowledge formation and Foucault
reminds us that knowledge is socially constructed. Chapter 3 locates the library
within the wider horizon of knowledge communities and communities of
44

connoisseurship and collecting. I examine the nexuses of collectors, bibliophiles,
scholars, librarians and dealers, who engaged with Lindsay and informed the
development and use of the library, considering how he classified and positioned
himself within the field of cultural production, especially in the locale of manuscript
collecting, and how his identity and distinction as an elite collector were fashioned
through these relationships. Agents such as Bernard Quaritch played a crucial role
in the development of the library and I investigate the nature of their relationships
with the earls. Lindsay’s networks are contrasted with those in which his son and
grandson participated towards the end of the century, a diachronic approach
revealing wider trends in bibliophilic networks and the field of cultural production.
The next two chapters focus more closely on the formation of the library, and its
manuscript components specifically, to develop the argument that the library was
constructed both to reinforce Lindsay’s social and cultural distinction and to further
his studies of racial classification. He assembled one of the most significant
collections of Oriental books and manuscripts in Britain, spanning the period when
Britain’s empire approached maturation. Through the lens of postcolonial studies,
Chapter 4 examines Lindsay’s motives and mechanisms for collecting Oriental
materials and his engagement with Orientalist discourses, and investigates how the
collections supported his researches into racial classification, ethnology and
comparative religion. It also reveals how Lindsay’s Orientalist interests were
imbricated with his concern for social and cultural distinction. Ludovic’s motives
for collecting Oriental materials are more opaque, and his collecting practices are
contrasted with those of his father.
Chapter 5 contends that Lindsay deployed the library – and his medieval and
Renaissance manuscripts especially – both to fashion his own social and cultural
identity as a gentleman of refined taste, discrimination and erudition, and to serve
as a bastion against the challenges which he perceived to be confronting his family
and the aristocracy as a whole during a period of unprecedented change. The library
was a construction of social class, taste and distinction, which positioned Lindsay
within ancient traditions of elite collecting, exemplified by the Florentine Medici
dynasty, upon whom he overtly (if problematically) modelled himself.

45

The Conclusion restates the principal research questions and arguments of the
thesis, emphasizing the original contributions to knowledge and elucidating
connections between the themes of the preceding chapters. I also outline proposals
for developing my research beyond the present thesis.

The Crawford Library Papers: Subject and Source

The Crawford Library Papers offer remarkable insights into the formation, evolution
and eventual dismemberment of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana. The archive comprises
117 volumes of ‘Crawford Library Letters’, dating from 1850 until 1909 and containing
over 50,000 items of correspondence, together with thirty volumes of receipts and
invoices, and much miscellaneous correspondence and accounts. Notwithstanding
the archive’s limitations and problematics, it forms an extraordinarily detailed
record of a major private library and constitutes one of the most important primary
sources for studies of manuscript collecting in Victorian Britain, richly illustrating
the processes by which the earls acquired material and their relationships with
fellow collectors, bibliophiles, scholars and dealers.
Lindsay’s monumental Library Report, or ‘Report on the present state and future
prospects of the Crawford and Balcarres or Lindesian Library’, composed between
1861 and 1865 and extending to almost 190,000 words, is unique in the annals of
nineteenth-century book collecting (Figs 5.1 & 5.2). It provides a detailed exposition
and vindication of the collecting principles and practices upon which the library
was built; it contains an exhaustive account of the contents of the library as it was
constituted in the early 1860s; and it represents a manifesto of intent, a ‘blueprint’
to guide Lindsay and Ludovic in the ongoing development of the library. No other
nineteenth-century collector of books and manuscripts has left such a
comprehensive account or justification of his collecting activities. 67
Derrida, Caroline Steedman, Antoinette Burton and other contributors to the recent
‘archival turn’ have problematized traditional notions of archives as passive,

67

An interesting parallel is Ferdinand de Rothschild’s art-collecting memoir, ‘Bric-a-Brac’.

impartial repositories of truth; they have exposed archives to the invigorating
influences of cultural and literary theories. 68 The ‘archival turn’ has also politicized
archives: politics are inscribed in their constituent documents, in their exclusions
and silences, and in the systems and conventions governing access to them. An
accurate assessment of the research significance – and limitations – of the Crawford
Library Papers therefore requires us to reconstruct the complex history of the
archive, to interrogate its truth-claims, and to explore its silences, biases and degree
of constructedness. The following discussion is framed by John Randolph’s
suggestion that biography rather than institutional history is an appropriate
framework for reflecting upon the history of an archive. Biography encourages us to
consider the life-history of the archive, from its creation and active administrative
life, through phases of stasis and reorganization, accretion and loss, care and
neglect, to the present day. 69
Lindsay apparently preserved all incoming letters from booksellers and others, from
the early 1850s onwards. Copies of out-letters were recorded as drafts or summaries,
written in his minute, barely legible hand, on scraps of paper or in empty spaces of
in-letters. This material was presumably kept in packets or bundles, arranged
chronologically perhaps. Upon his succession, Ludovic asked Quaritch and other
booksellers to return all his father’s letters. Quaritch duly despatched a case of
correspondence, covering the years 1852‒80, to Haigh in February 1881. 70 When J. P.
Edmond was appointed librarian in 1891, Ludovic instructed him ‘to keep all letters
& copies of answers Press or manifold in [a] way that they can be got at easily – as it
is a great advantage’. 71 The returned out-letters were painstakingly interfiled with

the in-letters and Lindsay’s drafts and notes, and Edmond arranged for them to be
pasted onto guard-sheets and bound by John Fazakerley of Liverpool, thus forming
the chronological volumes of Library Letters.
The binding of the Library Letters, and the associated series of receipts and
invoices, served a practical purpose: to create a readily accessible reference source
in order to augment Ludovic’s knowledge of the library. As the library outgrew the
capacity of a single intellect to comprehend it, the archive assumed greater
importance as a means of (re)imposing order; it functioned as a panoptical
instrument of control and surveillance, just as the entire library operated as a
panopticon, offering Lindsay (and later Ludovic) a commanding vision of the world
represented in it. Ultimately, the archive would serve as a surrogate for the library,
following the twentieth-century dispersal of most of the collections.
The establishment of a formalized, comprehensive archive documenting the
library’s formation also reveals Ludovic’s strong sense of the historical importance
of the library: the archive would reinforce the library’s significance, then and in the
future. The chronological arrangement evinced the library’s development over
many decades, validating the library not only by confirming the context and
provenance of many of the individual works and constituent collections found
within it, but also by documenting the earls’ sustained financial, intellectual and
emotional investment in it. This was in marked contrast to the ‘instant’ collections
acquired by Enriqueta Rylands, or by Lord Ashburnham earlier in the century,
which were not true collections at all, according to Pearce: ‘in order to be
honourable and genuine, collections must have been acquired over the years, and
piece or group at a time.’ 72 When Enriqueta acquired the Crawford manuscripts, she
did not obtain the Library Papers which documented their pedigree and
provenance. The archive, or the lack of it, mirrored the social positions of the
respective owners. The Library Papers are a component of the vast Crawford family
muniments, which span many centuries. Such collections uphold patriarchal
hegemony etymologically, ontologically and structurally: ‘muniment’ derives from
the Latin munire, ‘to defend’; the term denotes records preserved as evidence of

72

Pearce, On Collecting, p. 235.

48

entitlement to rights and privileges; and archives reflect hegemony in their
hierarchical structure, which diagrammatically resembles a family pedigree. Thus
the Library Papers not only document the manuscripts, but also affirm their preeminence. Enriqueta, by contrast, was an arriviste, a middle-class product of
nineteenth-century entrepreneurialism, without a distinguished pedigree, who died
childless leaving instructions for her personal papers to be destroyed. 73 While she
was able to purchase the Crawford manuscripts as tangible goods, she was unable to
acquire their intangible connotations – their saturated history and Lindsay’s
overarching intellectual project for which they had been assembled – although the
aristocratic associations of the Spencer and Crawford collections were arguably a
major attraction to her. 74
Following Edmond’s appointment in 1891, the volume of correspondence increased
dramatically, reflecting both his obligation to account to his (frequently absent)
employer for his every action and item of expenditure, and the professionalization
of the library’s management, itself exemplifying wider systematizing trends. He was
assisted by the introduction of a wet copying press, which produced copies of his
outbound letters on tissue-paper, to form a complete record of all outward as well
as incoming communications.
Although the Library Letters are particularly valuable in containing both sides of
the correspondence, they are an artificial construct rather than an organic archive,
in that Ludovic recalled his father’s letters to Quaritch and other booksellers,
thereby compromising the archive’s integrity and its status as an impartial record of
events. The ‘constructedness’ of the archive is most obviously expressed in its
outward appearance: the bundles of papers accumulated by Lindsay and Quaritch
were transformed into row upon row of volumes uniformly bound in burgundy
morocco, lettered in gilt on the spines. The archive, refashioned in the guise of a

library collection, thus forms a tangible monument to the earls of Crawford and
their extraordinary endeavour in building the library.
No archive is comprehensive or neutral, and the researcher must be alive to the
archive’s partiality (in both senses) and to attempts – deliberate or inadvertent – to
manipulate it. Pregnant silences may arise from deliberate censorship and
suppression of evidence; accidental losses over time cause the archive to speak sotto
voce; while informal, spoken communications are unlikely to be inscribed in the
archive in the first place. In this case, while there is no evidence of deliberate
expurgation, the Library Papers are largely mute on certain issues, such as visitors
to the library (in the absence of surviving visitors’ books) and the informal
bibliographical discussions which undoubtedly took place within the family circle,
around the dinner table or within the library itself. Occasionally these ephemeral
discourses leave faint archival traces; when, for example, Bal mentions to Edmond
his conversations at the Carlton and Burlington Fine Arts clubs with the likes of
Sydney Cockerell and Henry Yates Thompson.
The effort and expense Ludovic devoted to the archive suggest that it served to
celebrate and corroborate the importance of the library and that therefore there was
at least an unconscious process of positive figuration. Indeed, within the archive
one occasionally glimpses a knowingness amongst its creators, an awareness of the
archive’s historical significance. For example, Bal wrote to his father in 1900,
enclosing a letter from Barkentin & Krall, who admitted that a Byzantine bookcover they had tried to sell to the library was a forgery: ‘Please keep it for the
Library Correspondence as shewing that the honest broker still exists.’ 75
More insidious forms of bias arise from imbalances in the power relationships
between different groups who have a stake in the archive. Derrida asserts that
power is inscribed in the archive, which etymologically derives from the Greek
arkheion, the residence of the superior magistrates. ‘There is no political power
without control of the archive, if not of memory.’ 76 Individuals and groups
occupying positions of authority and high social status, those possessing superior

economic, cultural and social capital, are more likely to be represented in archives,
and on more favourable terms, than those who do not possess such advantages –
subalterns – since archives are typically created by and on behalf of elites, the
archons.
The Crawford Library Papers are deeply implicated in the asymmetrical power
dynamics of the library. Lindsay’s correspondence with booksellers and other
suppliers exemplifies the unequal relationship of aristocrat and petit-bourgeois
tradesmen. His letters are often hastily written, casual missives, with numerous
corrections and the briefest of appellations, whereas booksellers observed due
deference in the formality of their epistles. The very presence in the archive of
Lindsay’s letters to booksellers demonstrates their subaltern status, since they
readily acquiesced in Ludovic’s request for their surrender. Furthermore, the
archive not only represents these hierarchized relationships; it was also a potent
device to reinforce them. Ludovic and his librarian used the archive as a check
against suppliers repeatedly offering the same material, for instance.
Edmond occupied an intermediary position between Ludovic and external
suppliers, acting as gatekeeper to the library and to his employer. He was invested
with authority by virtue of his position, but his powers were circumscribed, and
major decisions were referred to Ludovic. The archive reflects this (at times
uncomfortable) ambivalence. Edmond was peremptory with suppliers, berating
bookbinders for poor workmanship, criticizing booksellers for failing to supply
issues of periodicals, and rebuffing or simply ignoring offers of books that he
considered inappropriate or overpriced. On the other hand, he was suitably
deferential towards his employer and other members of the family. Edmond was
sedulous in keeping Ludovic informed of the minutiae of library business, yet his
regular reports testify to, and were necessitated by, the latter’s prolonged absences
from Wigan. The archive served to demonstrate his prudent stewardship of the
library, but it also functioned as an instrument of surveillance upon Edmond
himself, a substitute for Ludovic’s personal supervision.
These considerations do not diminish the significance of the Library Papers, but
one must be alive to the full richness of the archive’s layered history and manifold
contexts, its silences and partiality, in order to evaluate accurately its evidential
51

value. The Library Papers have been shaped both physically and epistemologically
by their creators and by the wider social, cultural and political forces that have
intruded upon them, just as these shaped the library itself. The archive is therefore
as much the subject as the source of my investigation. Indeed, the themes I have
discussed in this section – the archive’s classification and hierarchical structure, its
role in corroborating the earls’ social distinction, and the unequal relationships of
dominant and dominated players inscribed within it – will recur in subsequent
chapters.

2 Organizations of Knowledge: Structure and Classification
of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana

2.1

Introduction

Collecting and classification are intensely intricated. Collecting implies
categorization – the conscious or subliminal determination of what is collectable –
while the practicalities of accumulation demand some form of ordering if chaos is
to be averted. John Elsner and Roger Cardinal assert that ‘the plenitude of
taxonomy opens up the space for collectables to be identified, but at the same time
the plenitude of that which is to be collected hastens the need to classify.’ 1 Within
libraries, there is a constant tension between endeavours to impose ‘standards of
coherence’ – by means of catalogues, classification schemes, and systems of shelving
and retrieval – and the centrifugal forces that threaten disintegration. 2 The latter
are particularly potent in large and diverse libraries, but are intrinsic to any
collection; in Walter Benjamin’s words, ‘there is in the life of a collector a dialectical
tension between the poles of disorder and order.’ 3
This chapter explores how the dynamic of collecting and classification operated
within the Bibliotheca Lindesiana. Using concepts such as the panorama,
Benjamin’s polarity of order/disorder, and widespread nineteenth-century anxieties
over ‘information overload’, I examine the principles and practices by which Lindsay
and Ludovic organized a vast and rapidly expanding panoptical library that
constantly threatened to overwhelm them. The library offered itself as fertile
ground for innovative ordering schemes, yet it continually resisted their efforts to
establish and maintain physical and intellectual control. I contextualize these

endeavours within nineteenth-century epistemological and organizational
landscapes, and specifically discourses concerning taxonomies, disciplinarity, and
the ramification and professionalization of knowledge.
Lindsay’s abiding interest in the classification of libraries was articulated through
the Library Report and other projects. My investigation therefore focuses upon the
Report which, standing in a metonymic relationship to the library, offers a
conspectus across the broad sweep of the collections and exemplifies their
organization, to the extent that it serves as a surrogate for the actual, now largely
dispersed library. I also examine the extent to which Lindsay’s theories of
classification translated into the actual arrangement of the library, and the degree
to which they were compromised by practical considerations.
Of course, such classifications were not drawn up and implemented in isolation.
They must be located within a genealogy – or meta-classification – of classification
schemes and the organization of knowledge from the sixteenth century onwards.
They also reflect to varying degrees the religious, socio-cultural and intellectual
biases of their creators, and I explore the extent to which Lindsay’s concerns with
the theory and practice of library classification mirrored and indeed corroborated
his preoccupations with social and racial distinctions.
A further question arises from the foregoing issues: to what extent were the
manuscripts physically integrated with the rest of the library, or were they treated
as a discrete category of material, and if so, did this reflect a conceptual distinction
on Lindsay’s part? Finally, this chapter examines how Ludovic’s practices differed
from Lindsay’s, situating his endeavours to reorganize the library and his
appointment of a full-time librarian within the context of the professionalization of
libraries in the late nineteenth century.

2.2

‘Between the poles of disorder and order’: Lindsay’s Response to
‘Information Overload’

Concerns over ‘information overload’ have been manifest in many cultures and eras,
but anxieties were particularly acute in nineteenth-century Britain. 4 A matrix of
factors generated significant (if variable) increases in monograph and serial
publications: advances in printing and paper-making technologies reduced
production costs; improvements in communication networks facilitated the
gathering and distribution of information; the increasing reach and complexity of
government were contingent upon and generated a growing mass of statistical data
and official publications; the ramification of academic, professional, scientific and
technical disciplines created new source material and markets for specialist
publications; and increasing literacy and expansion of the middle classes
encouraged the development of leisure reading and reading for self-improvement. 5
This is not to imply a direct relationship between the expansion of print and the
growth of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana; as a private collection, rather than a public
copyright library, its growth was determined by the wealth, interests and ambitions
of its owners. Nevertheless, it is important to contextualize the library’s
development within these wider anxieties and the measures that were taken to

address them, such as the gradual professionalization of librarianship, the
formulation of new cataloguing technologies and procedures, and the burgeoning of
literary reviews and specialist bibliographies, to guide readers and collectors
through the proliferation of print and enable them to select suitable literature
according to canons of taste.
Lindsay did not share Sir Thomas Phillipps’s unrealizable desire to possess ‘one
copy of every book in the world’. 6 His ambition was to create a panoptical library
containing ‘the best that is known and thought in the world’, in order to serve the
present and future needs of the Lindsay family and of a wider circle of associates
and scholars. His interests were encyclopaedic and the library in turn afforded him
a comprehensive perspective across several continents, epochs of time and many
cultures. It was a product of the same impulse that, Bernard Comment argues, lay
behind the phenomenon of the scenic panorama: ‘The invention of the panorama
was a response to a particularly strong nineteenth-century need – for absolute
dominance. It gave individuals the happy feeling that the world was organized
around and by them, yet this was a world from which they were also separated and
protected, for they were seeing it from a distance.’ 7 Thus the vast scale and
ambition of the library simultaneously furnished Lindsay with the information and
commanding perspective that his studies demanded, and exacerbated the problem
of ‘information overload’. In 1834, the year in which Lindsay began to collect books
seriously, he counted 6,636 volumes in the Haigh library. By 1870 the number had
risen to 24,080, and a further five thousand had been added by 1872. 8

Like Middle Hill, Haigh Hall was under constant threat of being overwhelmed by
books, requiring periodic physical adjustments to accommodate continual accruals.
Ludovic later recalled: ‘books came pouring in, on all subjects from all parts of the
world, far quicker indeed than it was possible to shelve them: room after room had
its walls covered.’ 9 His sister Alice concurred: their father’s library ‘was the apple of
his eye, and though he loved pictures and art, books were the passion of his life, and
walls, tables, shelves, rooms, passages, and finally floors were covered with them at
Haigh’. 10 She described one clearance campaign in February 1870: ‘the floor of the
Long Room is gradually being cleared of its stupendous mass of books, they have
hitherto lain in heaps covered with white sheets looking like corpses. The chicks
[younger children] are indefatigable carrying them away in a wheelbarrow of
Annie’s and putting them up on the shelves in the passages.’ 11 As well as evoking the
materiality of the library, her striking simile suggests that not everyone in the family
subscribed to Milton’s contention that books contain ‘a potencie of life’. Anne
Lindsay certainly perceived an abundance of life in the library, but only when
mediated through her son-in-law: ‘I am enjoying Lindsay’s books and every day
become acquainted with some new ones […] the Library apart from Lindsay is so
large as to be like a wilderness. But with him it is full of the most beautiful flowers
and the sweetest fruit.’ 12 Her metaphor was inspired by Lindsay’s acquisition of
Paul, Trench, Trübner, 1902), p. 403; de Ricci, p. 162. Fletcher’s and de Ricci’s estimates are
confirmed by Bal in his diary entry for 19 May 1917, in Vincent, p. 379. In comparison,
Phillipps estimated in 1856 that he owned 20,000 manuscripts and 30,000 printed books. By
the time of his death in 1872 numbers had increased to perhaps 60,000 and 50,000
respectively. A. N. L. Munby, The Formation of the Phillipps Library from 1841 to 1872,

Sowerby’s English Botany, but recalls the familiar topos of the book or library as a
garden. 13
Lindsay was indeed the key to the library, its gardener and its archon. 14 The library
was the extrinsic manifestation of Lindsay’s interests and thought processes; it was,
literally, his brain-child. Arguably only one other library has manifested such
congruity between its content and organization and the thought patterns of its
creator: the Warburg Library, where ‘the books remain a body of living thought as
Warburg had planned.’ 15 Lindsay never employed a librarian, fearful perhaps that
such assistance might compromise the close, personal control that he could exert
over the library. Instead, with the (often unremarked) support of his wife and
mother-in-law, he shouldered the entire responsibility for its management,
purchasing books and manuscripts, recording accessions, physically arranging the
collections, coordinating specialist cataloguing and binding through Quaritch, and
answering enquiries from fellow collectors and scholars, as well as studying the
collections for his own research. At times the burden seemed to overwhelm him: he
regularly complained of headaches and eye-strain.
In order to assimilate the plethora of books and manuscripts continually entering
the library, Lindsay developed a distinctive accessioning and cataloguing system,
which Ludovic later outlined:

Working Museum of the Mind’, Common Knowledge, 18.1 (2012), 180‒7. The Warburg
Library was institutionalized – and thus to an extent ossified – after its owner’s death,
whereas the Bibliotheca Lindesiana passed to its founder’s son and was therefore liable to
reinterpretation, reconstruction and ultimately dispersal.

For many years he was satisfied to mark off a purchase on his ideal desiderata
list, 16 and then to enter it on a folio sheet, author, short title, place and date,
in fact a title-a-line accession list – and the next purchase would follow
irrespective of order. I think it must have been about the years 1862‒65 that
these folio sheets of accessions were cut up and the slips pasted down on
sheets, this time in order of the alphabet, and my impression remains of the
pile of sheets, being nearly a foot and a half thick. Then as more books came
in they were entered as accessions which after a time were in turn cut up and
formed into another alphabet, and another, and another, and yet, so clear was
his memory and his sense of locality, that he was not dependent on this pile of
folio sheets of catalogue; if any one were to ask him, Is such a book in the
Library? he would always answer without hesitation No, or Yes, you will find it
on such a shelf in such a room. 17
While this seemingly haphazard arrangement of piles of paper may have been an
inadequate guide to the library for others, for whom it remained a ‘wilderness’, terra
incognita, it satisfactorily served Lindsay’s requirements, despite Ludovic’s assertion
that his father had intended to amalgamate the sheets into a single sequence but
dreaded the labour involved. 18 For they combined two representations of the
library, materially manifesting its chronological development in the succession of
stacks, while affording ready access to its contents in the form of several
alphabetical indices. Lindsay was able to navigate his way around the Haigh library

Lindsay compiled the desiderata list on loose sheets, one author or work per sheet; these

were arranged alphabetically and later bound. Now Edinburgh, National Library of

– physically and conceptually – both through his intellectual mastery of these
towers of paper and by long familiarity with the library’s topography, its
arrangement of rooms, corridors, bookcases, shelves and the disposition of the
volumes upon them, with items of furniture and pictures serving as supplementary
visual cues. In a move that recalls Bachelard’s topoanalysis (‘the systematic
psychological study of the sites of our intimate lives’), Annette Carruthers offers an
insight into the relationship between thought processes and the spaces in which
they occur: ‘Buildings become enfolded in people’s thinking habits. The
remembered familiarity of a building’s plan […] seems actually to channel and
“carry” the movements of one’s thinking. The mind is entirely freed to make its
thoughts when it also has entirely familiar habitations and its familiar routes, a
principle well understood in meditative practice.’ 19 Of course, for Lindsay the Haigh
library was especially redolent with such mental catenae, having been generated out
of his interests and intellect in the first place. Indeed, one reason why he never
enacted his ambition of transferring the library from Haigh to Dunecht, his house
in rural Aberdeenshire (apart from lengthy delays in the construction work) may
have been the realization that his intimate familiarity with the library, his
intellectual and somatic mastery of it, and the manifold connections between its
physical disposition and organization and his own thought processes, might have
been disturbed by its relocation. Notwithstanding occasional lapses, Lindsay’s
prodigious memory was interwoven with the topography of the library.

2.3

A ‘structured and structuring structure’: The Library Report and
Library Classification

While developing this system of accession sheets, Lindsay was concurrently
compiling the Library Report, which offered a more discursive account of the
present state of the library and served as a manifesto and blueprint for its future
development. Bourdieu’s famously laconic definition of habitus as a ‘structured and

could put his hand on any book without fail, and without a catalogue or list’ (Meynell, p.
28).

structuring structure’ is a useful formulation with which to consider the Report. 20 It
is a ‘structured structure’ in that it is arranged in a highly organized manner,
according to established taxonomies of knowledge whose origins lay in the
medieval period and were refined by later generations of philosophers,
bibliographers and encyclopaedists, as I shall discuss shortly. It is also a ‘structuring
structure’, which seeks to impose order upon, and establish intellectual control
over, a vast and rapidly expanding library that constantly threatened to engulf its
owner and the household in a torrent of books. Furthermore, while the Report
instantiates and reinforces the internal structure of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana, it
also overtly positions the library within a wider tradition of great libraries ranging
from the ancient civilizations, through China and the Islamic world, to modern
Europe.
The Report is situated within two long-established practices: one describing actual
libraries, the other outlining idealized libraries containing all possible works within
their ambit of collecting (Chartier’s ‘libraries without walls’). 21 Both conventions
(accommodated by the dual meanings of ‘bibliotheca’/‘bibliothèque’) confronted the
challenge of describing the contents in a structured, comprehensible fashion. At
this point a brief outline of the history of library classification will help to
contextualize Lindsay’s endeavours. 22 Alain Besson cautions against simplistic

equivalences between bibliographical classifications and wider epistemological
taxonomies. 23 However, in the early modern period (Foucault’s Classical episteme)
the development of library classification was unquestionably allied to other systems
for the organization of knowledge: the curricula of university teaching, rooted in
the medieval programmes of the trivium and quadrivium; the arrangement of
encyclopaedias; and the taxonomic projects which sought to comprehend and
control the natural world. 24 These knowledge systems were indeed thickly
connected. Links between the curriculum and the order of books in university and
college libraries are obvious, but there were also correlations between taxonomies
and library classifications; the latter were influenced by the development of
increasingly sophisticated proto-scientific taxonomies, which were in turn shaped
by the organization of the libraries within whose walls natural philosophers studied.
There was also coincidence in the personnel involved in these enterprises: obvious
examples include Konrad Gesner (1516‒65), author of the Bibliotheca universalis and
pioneer of the study of plants and animals, and the polymath Leibniz, who served as
librarian at Hannover and Wolfenbüttel and formulated his Idea Leibnitiana
Bibliothecae ordinandae contractior. 25 Mazarin’s librarian, Gabriel Naudé (1600‒53),
recommended organizing a library under the faculties of théologie, médicine,

jurisprudence, histoire, philosophie, mathématiques and humanitez, each of which
he further particularized. 26 In the Encyclopédie, Diderot and d’Alembert grafted
their humanist tree of knowledge upon the trifurcated root-stock planted by ‘le
Chancélier Bacon’: from the three faculties of memory, reason and imagination
sprang respectively history, philosophy and poetry (liberally interpreted); reason
was privileged over imagination and memory, while theology was notoriously
subordinated to philosophy. 27 Jacques-Charles Brunet (1780‒1867) restored
theology’s primacy, refining Naudé’s scheme and those of subsequent
bibliographers in his celebrated Manuel du libraire et de l’amateur de livres, which
went through five editions between 1810 and 1860‒65. 28 Brunet’s classification
comprised five principal divisions (théologie, jurisprudence, sciences et arts, belleslettres and histoire) each with several further subdivisions. The complexity and
sophistication of his scheme reflected not only the increasing specialization and
fragmentation of knowledge but also the urgent need to exercise control over the
rapid multiplication of books in the nineteenth century: 11,229 titles are listed in the
first edition, 31,872 in the fifth. Indeed, the Manuel served as a vade mecum, guiding
collectors like Lindsay in their choice of which works to acquire, both directing and
affirming their taste and discrimination.
Lindsay had a life-long interest in the classification of knowledge and libraries,
which appears to have pre-dated the precipitous expansion of the Bibliotheca

Lindesiana and the practical requirements of organizing his own library. In the
Library Report he asserts: ‘I have for years been occupied at intervals in methodising
and completing a system of classification which I think will be found to be more
scientific and more practically useful than any hitherto proposed.’ 29 Reflecting this
interest were the many works on classification that found a place in the library,
including several editions of Brunet and works by Naudé, Garnier, Horne and
Pourcelet. 30 Lindsay explains in the Report that he acquired such books with two
objects in mind: ‘one, the collection of the library itself, the other, the formation […]
of a new System of Classification, more scientific and more convenient, founded in
great measure upon my peculiar views of philosophy as expressed in “Progression
by Antagonism”’. 31
Lindsay’s earliest extant classification scheme appears in Progression by Antagonism
(1846). Here, employing a Hegelian dialectic, he modifies Bacon’s tripartite
classification of the human faculties – memory, reason and imagination – into
reason, imagination and a synthesis of the two. 32 He omits memory and

understanding on the grounds that they ‘do not induce difference of pursuit or
purpose’ and are ‘subsidiary to Imagination and Reason’; in actuality their exclusion
is necessary to preserve the symmetry of his progressive dualism. 33 At the end of the
essay, Lindsay presents a ‘Classification of Human Thought’ in the form of a
dichotomous or bifurcated diagram, a format whose own family tree can be traced
back through the Encyclopédie and the taxonomies of Linnaeus to Bacon and
Ramus. 34 In this visualization of knowledge superficially resembling the schema in
the preface to Chambers’s Cyclopædia, 35 he proceeds from the general faculties on
the left-hand side of the diagram, through a series of bifurcations or antagonisms,
to a set of forty specific subjects on the right, some of which are further subdivided
to produce fifty discrete categories (Fig. 2.2). In a footnote Lindsay claims that ‘By
associating several of the Sciences and Arts here separated in analysis […] this might
be made the basis and skeleton of an extended Classification for a Library’, in which
case he proposes that a ‘supplementary class’ should be added, comprising
miscellaneous collected works, encyclopaedias, reviews, general literary history and
general bibliography. However, because the classification is founded upon his
theory of antagonism, Lindsay is induced to create artificial oppositions between
categories, resulting in a fragmented taxonomy wholly unsuitable for library
classification – whether hierarchical or encyclopaedic – unless, as he suggests, it

synonymous with ethics) stems quite differently: SCIENCE > PRACTICAL OR APPLIED >

Progression by Antagonism elicited derision from Ruskin in his anonymous review:
‘It is generally easier to plan what is beyond the reach of others than to execute
what is within our own; and it had been well if the range of this introductory essay
had been something less extensive, and its reasoning more careful.’ 36
In Progression by Antagonism, Lindsay attempted unsuccessfully to reconcile the
analytical, fissile approach intrinsic to classification with his natural preference for
Baconian synthesis and balance. The latter was instantiated in his belief in the
reconciliation of reason and imagination within the Church of England and Britain’s
balanced constitution; in his multifarious literary output of prose and poetry; and in
his career as an amateur gentleman-scholar whose studies ranged expansively
across diverse fields, including art history, literature, theology, philosophy, history,
anthropology and ethnology, in a period when disciplinary boundaries remained
porous and the authority of the academy was not yet well established. 37 Allied to
Lindsay’s polymathy was his ambition – discussed later in this chapter – to create a
wide-ranging, panoptical library.
Tensions between classification and catholicity – between microscopic and
macroscopic – remained largely unresolved in Lindsay’s career, and point to wider
nineteenth-century debates over the relative merits of generalism and

specialization. 38 During the 1860s he essayed a more functional classification, which
could serve the practical needs of a library. According to his son, Lindsay ‘wrote a
long memorandum on the subject [of classification] some twenty or thirty years
before his death (I think) but, though it is complete he never wrote it out for the
press, but laid it aside.’ 39 This document seemingly survives as a substantial bound
volume containing disjointed drafts of a detailed classification scheme (Fig. 2.3). 40
That Lindsay intended the scheme to be applicable to libraries, rather than being a
purely theoretical construct, is indicated by the arrangement of Belles Lettres, for
example:
1. Introduction to Belles Lettres
2. Dictionaries
3. Rhetoric
4. Poetry
5. Romance
6. Collections, Miscellanies, Belles Lettres
7. General Hist[ory] Belles Lettres
8. Philosophy of Belles Lettres
9. Miscellanies
10. Bibliography of Belles Lettres
In fact, this project was never completed: certain sections, such as Belles Lettres,
Theology and Language are highly developed, each running to scores of pages and
containing up to fifteen levels of subdivision; others, such as Poesy and Logic, are
merely inchoate sketches. Nor is there any indication of how Lindsay intended to
link these broad subjects into an overarching intellectual framework, similar to the
scheme in Progression by Antagonism. Perhaps he found it impossible to reconcile

his propensities towards synthesis and abstraction with the contrary, centrifugal
tendencies towards complication and atomization. The extraordinary degree of
subdivision in certain sections of the scheme suggests a febrile, hyper-analytical
mind; the scope for limitless regression meant that Lindsay could never complete
the scheme to his satisfaction. It also fatally compromised the practicability of the
scheme for the organization of libraries.
Such difficulties may explain Lindsay’s decision not to implement his idiosyncratic
classification scheme in the Report, which was intended as a functional document,
guiding Lindsay and his successors in the library’s continuing development.
Practical considerations dictated that it should instead adopt the structure of
Brunet’s Manuel, the most widely consulted guide to rare and antiquarian books in
this period. Indeed, the Report adheres with remarkable fidelity to the arrangement
of the fourth edition of the Manuel (1842‒44): see Appendix 2. 41 Throughout the
Report Lindsay repeatedly cites Brunet as an authority on bibliographical issues,
and employs him as a benchmark against which to measure the rarity of his own
books, both positively – quoting the French bibliographer’s approbation of certain
editions – and negatively, noting rare works in the library that had escaped his
attention: ‘unknown to Brunet’ is a recurrent boast. 42 Lindsay identifies other
shortcomings of Brunet, criticizing in particular the Roman Catholic bias that he
perceives in French classification schemes:

41

Jacques-Charles Brunet, Manuel du libraire et de l’amateur de livres, 4me edn, 5 vols (Paris:

chez Silvestre, 1842‒44). The Report was compiled contemporaneously with the fifth edition
of the Manuel (1860‒65). Mérimée claimed that ‘les bouquinistes savent par coeur le Manuel
de Brunet’. Prosper Mérimée, ‘Le procès de M. Libri’, Revue des deux mondes, 1re série, 14
(1852), 306‒36 (p. 331). Quoted in translation by P. Alessandra Maccioni Ruju and Marco

E.g., ‘a valuable work, of which, according to Brunet, “fort peu d’exemplaires sont

parvenues en Europe.”’ LR, Historical Paralipomena, p. 22. Less frequently Lindsay cites

Panzer.

74

French classification, I should here premise, being the work of Roman
Catholics, does not recognise the coequal dignity of the Greek with ^and^ the
Latin Church subsequently to the schism of the East and West, and still less
the position of the Church of England as a branch of the Church Catholic. But
this is of little consequence. Although following the general outline of
Brunet’s ^System^, I acknowledge no slavery to it, and shall deviate from it
when I see sufficient cause. 43
In fact, while some sections of Brunet’s Manuel may betray Roman Catholic bias, it
was noted earlier that French classification was also influenced by trees of
knowledge compiled by Protestants such as Bacon and Chambers. Indeed, Lindsay
vehemently condemns the humanist ‘irreligion’ of Diderot and d’Alembert,
describing the Encyclopédie as a ‘pest-house of moral contagion […] by which the
Freethinkers of the last century endeavoured to sap the foundations and ramparts
of Christianity’. 44 However, he fails to comment upon the broader Western
perspective from which almost all classifications of knowledge developed and which
relegated non-European cultures (as well as subalterns within Europe) to
subordinate, marginal roles. I shall consider shortly the degree of association
between Lindsay’s own classificatory theories and practices, and his preoccupations
with racial and social distinctions.

Of course, there is a significant difference between the theoretical organization of a
library, as represented in a catalogue or classification scheme, and its physical
instantiation – the actual arrangement of books on shelves. Practical issues – space
limitations, variations in the size of volumes, non-standard formats such as rolls
and portfolios, the need to protect precious items from the curious and lightfingered, convenience of access to frequently consulted material, and the
requirement to accommodate continual accruals – intrude upon idealized notions
of how a library ought to be arranged to reflect the organization of knowledge and

75

the interests of the collector. 45 In the case of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana, evidence of
how the library was materially organized is scant. If, as seems plausible, the books
were arranged into broad subject categories, such as the scheme outlined in the
Report, this arrangement was compromised by other considerations, such as
Lindsay’s concern to safeguard the most valuable items, which he kept in his own
room. In 1864 he told his wife that ‘I have been hard at work ever since breakfast till
lunch removing and arranging books for packing, with the view of having the more
valuable ones packed together so as to be easily and at once saved from fire, if
necessary.’ 46 A volume compiled by Lindsay in the mid-1860s records the books and
manuscripts housed in sixteen drawers under a large table in his room. Whereas
one might have expected the contents to be organized in an obviously meaningful
order, perhaps thematically, there is no apparent commonality between the
contents of most drawers, besides their generally special nature. For example,
drawer eight contained one volume of the 42-line (Gutenberg) Bible, various literary
and liturgical works such as the 1502 Aldine edition of Dante and a Mozarabic
Breviary, the Henry of Chichester Missal manuscript, and David Lindsay’s Godly
Mans Iourney (1625). Similarly, while drawer fifteen held predominantly religious
works, its contents also included the Shakespeare First Folio and a 1496 edition of
Marco Polo. 47
Despite Lindsay’s abiding interest in the principles of classification and his quest for
the ideal system of arrangement, the practicalities of managing the ever-expanding
library sometimes defeated even his impressive organizational powers. In 1867 he
apologized to David Laing for his inability to locate a sixteenth-century armorial
compiled by Sir David Lindsay:

I have mislaid it within the last two years, and in spite of every search have
not as yet been able to find it […]. I do not think it is lost; but about the time
referred to a large number of our most valuable books were packed up & put
away for security, in anticipation of some alterations being made at Haigh, &
I have not yet discovered the locality where the Armorial found refuge. 48
In 1872 the books and manuscripts were divided between no less than six locations
at Haigh Hall: the ‘Passage’ (9,400 volumes), Billiard Room (4,800), East Library
(3,900), Lindsay’s Room (5,980), South Library (3,799) and Boudoir (1,185). 49 The
visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to Haigh in 1873 necessitated ‘a general
clearance of the house, as just then books were everywhere awaiting new shelving’,
exacerbating problems caused by Lindsay’s declining health and extended periods
abroad. Ludovic described how a volume of Tudor and Stuart proclamations, put
away in 1873, was only rediscovered ten years later, together with ‘many other scarce
works which had for long been mourned as lost’. 50 Lindsay himself was clearly
dissatisfied with the haphazard disposition of the collections, as he intimates in the
Report:
At present, as you are aware, at Haigh, our books and pictures are as it were
intermingled with each other, and scattered over the house. Half of the
ground floor is occupied by the books and half with by pictures; and it is the
same on the first story, [sic] upstairs. The general effect is, that neither
collection possesses the character of homogeneity and unity which ought to
belong to it; and that the impression produced in either case is that of

consistent, and living body corporate. 51
However, his plans for wholesale reorganization of the collections along more
systematic lines were constrained by his elderly father’s aversion to disturbance of
his domestic arrangements. For this reason, and because of the threat from the
polluted atmosphere of Wigan, he proposed the more radical solution of
transposing the Bibliotheca Lindesiana to Dunecht, where he intended to construct
a vast library room, a double cube one hundred feet long by fifty wide and fifty high,
capable of housing the entire collection. 52 Had this ambition been realized, it would
have enabled him to fulfil his desire to organize the library along scientific lines.
However, although a magnificent library was eventually constructed at Dunecht, to
designs by George Edmund Street which adhered closely to the specification set out
in the Library Report (Figs 2.4 & 2.5), the books were never transferred from
Lancashire, for reasons discussed above. The Report is thus situated within a long
tradition of unrealized or unrealizable utopian libraries that, in Chartier’s words,
‘would bring together all accumulated knowledge and all the books ever written.
[…] Bringing together the entire written patrimony of humanity in one place proves
an impossible task, though.’ 53

‘Classified by their classifications’: Connections between Library
Classification and Cultural and Racial Distinctions

The formulation and implementation of library classification schemes do not
operate in an ideological vacuum. Far from being disinterested, ‘natural’
representations of the world, classifications import, refract and corroborate the
epistemological, social, cultural, religious, racial and gendered outlooks of their
creators and practitioners. 54 As Bourdieu expresses it, ‘Social subjects, classified by
their classifications, distinguish themselves by the distinctions they make.’ 55 The
Bibliotheca Lindesiana was not immune from these biases and in this section I shall
explore how Lindsay’s interest in the classification of libraries intersected with, and
offers itself as a lens through which to view, his preoccupations with socio-cultural
and racial distinctions.
At a superficial level, one observes the striking visual correspondences between the
genealogical pedigrees which demonstrate Lindsay’s aristocratic lineage in Lives of
the Lindsays, the ramified tables he employs to expound his classification of
civilizations in Progression by Antagonism, and the dichotomous diagram
illuminating his ‘Classification of Human Thought’ in the latter work (Figs 2.2 &
4.1). 56 In each case the diagrams are rhetorical devices, connoting transparency,
certainty and impartiality, and eliding the ambiguities, contingency and polemicism
of Lindsay’s arguments. They also manifest his concern for hierarchy and order,

whether social, racial or epistemological. The connections between these
classificatory schemes must now be investigated more deeply.
In the Library Report, Lindsay makes explicit the connections between taste and
classification, and between the proper ordering of a library and its function in
consolidating social and cultural capital: ‘a choice and well ordered ^private^
Library exercises a most ennobling influence upon the family which possesses it,
and through such families upon society.’ 57 In order to confer distinction, both the
selection and organization of a library’s contents must be governed by taste and
discrimination; a well-ordered library engenders a well-ordered society. The
Phillipps library, by contrast, incorporated countless choice items but was
notoriously disorganized and cannot be said to have exerted an ennobling influence
upon its owner.
The Report’s representation of the library and the relative weighting of the several
departments within it reflect conventional notions of the hierarchy of knowledge
(such as the privileged position of theology), the traditional French classification
schemes, and Lindsay’s own elite tastes and intellectual interests. Thus primacy is
awarded to theology, to which some fifty pages of the Report are devoted and where
Lindsay boasts that the library is ‘decidedly rich in many subdivisions of that
department’, whereas jurisprudence ‘is but meagrely represented in our Library’. 58
Unsurprisingly, Lindsay does give special attention to one branch of jurisprudence:
to the ‘law of probation in genealogy, to the law of nobility generally on the
Continent, and to the peerage law of Britain at home’. 59 He admits that his interest
in this field has been piqued by his own genealogical research and endeavours to
prove his father’s entitlement to the earldom of Crawford and the dukedom of
Montrose.
Lindsay’s aristocratic outlook is also apparent in the lengthy supplement appended
to the historical section of the Report. ‘Historical Paralipomena’ comprise ‘the

History of Chivalry and Noblesse, or, as I would rather term it, Genealogical
History, or even, still more simply and comprehensively, Genealogy’. This was
matter of ‘unspeakable practical and political importance’ for Lindsay, not only for
his own studies, but because of his belief in the aristocracy’s pivotal, moderating
influence upon society:
I have sought to assemble together most important works on the subject of
Genealogy, Heraldry, and Chivalry, – and if you still think that the Library is
too redundant in this department, I must retreat on the excuse I have
pleaded on more than one previous occasion, that the class has attained a
special development through the necessities of my own studies. After all, the
doer of a great deed is as important as the deed he does; and Genealogy,
worthily written, would, as the biography of the ruling races of the world,
have a claim to rank and prominence equal at least to that of ordinary
history. 60
At a time when the position of the aristocracy was being challenged and when the
romantic medievalism that flourished in the early decades of the century was
waning, Lindsay makes a case for the continued relevance of works on chivalry and
noblesse. 61
A large section of the Report is devoted to belles-lettres or ‘polite literature’.
Lindsay, like Horne before him, adopted the French bibliographers’ expansive
interpretation of belles-lettres, encompassing the ‘science of language and
comparative grammar’, rhetoric, poetry, prose fiction, and philology or criticism. 62

section ‘Paralipomènes historiques’.

Belles-lettres was, John Guillory asserts, ‘a discourse of judgment or taste, designed
to cultivate a faculty of discrimination, the ability to distinguish good writing (“fine
letters”) from bad’. 63 Although the term was not imported into England until the
early eighteenth century, ‘polite literature’ or literae humaniores had been an
essential component of a gentleman’s library since the early modern period. 64 In
fact, Lindsay’s catholic definition conceals the tensions between the
philological/linguistic elements of belles-lettres and its more subjective, cultured
aspects. 65 These strains would eventually cause the belletristic discipline to break
apart. Belles-lettres infiltrated the academy for the first time in the eighteenth
century and briefly flourished there, thanks to the efforts of Hugh Blair (1718‒1800)
and other exponents of the Scottish Enlightenment, but Guillory maintains that it
was ‘always in danger of sinking to a merely effusive discourse of appreciation’, and
it remained underdeveloped as a discipline. 66 While philology would split off and
flourish in the nineteenth century, belles-lettres’ lack of rigour and scientificity led
to its marginalization within the increasingly research-orientated universities.

Lindsay’s emphasis on belles-lettres and its edifying function thus both positions
him outside the academy and aligns him with a nostalgic, elitist view of literature. 67
This is emphasized in the importance he attaches to the editiones principes of the
classics, which ‘have a peculiar and graceful value in point of bibliographical rarity
and interest ^esteem^ which has never as yet diminished, and which can only
become extinguished with the total decay of polite learning and refined feeling in
^the educated ranks of^ society’. 68 Thus the fortunes of the classics and the
enlightened elite are inextricably interwoven. In summary, there is considerable
evidence that Lindsay’s construction of cultural distinction and the organization of
the Bibliotheca Lindesiana were mutually reinforcing. The privileging of
(Protestant) theology, genealogical works and belles-lettres both reflected and
corroborated Lindsay’s elite habitus and his dominant position in the field of
cultural production.

Having considered the correlations between, on the one hand, Lindsay’s interests in
organizations of knowledge and of libraries and, on the other, his preoccupations
with social distinction, I now address the question of whether and to what extent
the former were imbricated with his fascination with Eastern cultures and racial
classification. In a general sense Orientalism and the organization of libraries were
densely connected. Benedict Anderson’s ‘totalizing classificatory grid’, which
features in Chapter 4, could equally be applied to libraries and the books and
manuscripts contained within them, both as objects to be controlled and as
instruments of colonial oppression. New knowledges acquired from European
exploration and conquest challenged traditional taxonomies and stimulated the
development of novel systems of classification, which were themselves mechanisms
of occidental domination. Tim Fulford, for example, argues that ‘Botanical
classification […] was one of the new enlightenment discourses by which Europe

83

took command of a world that, simultaneously, it was bringing under its colonial
control.’ 69 There are also striking visual symmetries between Lindsay’s classification
of knowledge and his racial taxonomies.
However, while Lindsay collected Oriental books and manuscripts ostensibly to
facilitate his studies of comparative religion and ethnology, there is no evidence
that the actual organization of the library was either influenced by or supported his
interest in ethnic classifications. Indeed, as Chapter 4 explicates, two striking
aspects of the Library Report are Lindsay’s generally liberal approach towards nonWestern cultures, and the considerable attention he devotes to Oriental books and
manuscripts. In almost every department of the library, Lindsay enumerates his
extensive holdings of Orientalia, as well as his desiderata, and he generously
acknowledges the contributions to human knowledge made by non-European
cultures, as when he asserts that ‘Oriental Medicine is, in fact, an important branch
of science, and both the Chinese and Arabs – the teachers of medical Christendom
through the Saracens and Jews – have contributed to the building up of the temple
of Esculapius.’ 70 The following passage, in which he defends the ‘literary catholicity’
of the library, exemplifies his enlightened attitude:
I am half afraid that you will grudge the space upon our shelves (although
not so very great after all) devoted to these Oriental literatures, but any such
prejudice will soon dissipate itself in the purer air of liberal appreciation for
which I plead. We of the Western world sin grievously against modesty in
asserting ^assuming^, as we commonly do, like the Greeks but without their
excuse, that all science, art, and literature not European must needs be
inferior and uninteresting, in a word, barbarous. This is very far from being
the case. 71

Thus there is considerable evidence that during Lindsay’s hegemony Western and
Oriental materials were neither physically nor intellectually segregated. While the
latter were never accorded full parity, they were generally integrated with the
European collections. Later in the century, in a move that paralleled the hardening
of racial and colonial attitudes in the European empires, the Oriental collections
were subject to increasing discipline/disciplinarity and separation; they were
exposed to Anderson’s ‘totalizing classificatory grid’. During the 1890s Ludovic’s
librarian, J. P. Edmond, arranged the manuscripts by language, protecting the more
valuable ones in glass-fronted bookcases and physically segregating the Oriental
and Western manuscripts:
I propose arranging these Oriental MSS. in 20 shelves on one side of the
glass case. The other side can be filled up with such European MSS. as you
have not room for downstairs […]. A further advance has been made in
arranging the gallery; the Japanese Library is shelved immediately
succeeding the Chinese Books; and after the Japs comes the lithographed
Oriental literature, and the Armenian printed books. 72
A divergence is also apparent in Ludovic’s endeavours to improve the cataloguing of
the library. The Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Chinese items were described in
summary ‘hand-lists’, whereas it was his (unrealized) intention to commission
detailed catalogues of the Latin and other European manuscripts, ‘a division in the
eyes of many by far the most important’. 73 A similar differentiation operated when
the cream of the manuscripts was exhibited at the Grafton Galleries in 1898: the
eighty-six Western manuscripts and bindings were treated to detailed individual
descriptions in the catalogue, while a selection of 156 Oriental items was grouped
into a single twelve-line entry. 74 Thus one can observe growing physical and

conceptual separation between Oriental books and manuscripts and the remainder
of the library. There are obvious parallels with the increasingly rigid segregation
and stratification operating within the bureaucratized ‘new imperialism’ of the late
nineteenth century; both were motivated by anxieties of control and
differentiation. 75 Likewise, Louise Tythacott has highlighted the increasing
systematization and segregation of ethnographic materials within nineteenthcentury museums, in response to new forms of knowledge. 76
On the other hand, it would be wrong to exaggerate the degree of separation
between the Oriental and Western sections of the library. It is possible to discern
‘transgressions’ or ‘border crossings’ between Oriental and Western manuscripts,
most obviously in Ludovic’s preference for classical and Christian texts amongst the
papyri he acquired in Egypt – reminders that the Graeco-Roman and ancient
Christian worlds did not respect modern geo-political boundaries – but also, more
subtly, in the Arabic texts which preserved ancient Greek science and philosophy, in
the Islamic influences perceptible in medieval Spanish manuscripts, and in the
famous ‘Egyptian’ page of the Colonna Missal. 77 By bringing together such a
diversity of books and manuscripts from many cultures and geographical regions,
the earls of Crawford exposed latent connections between these materials – their
mutual influences and accidental correspondences – as well as their obvious
differences. Thus both the content of the manuscripts and the earls’ approaches to

‘The Museum or curiosity department’: The Organization of
Manuscripts within the Bibliotheca Lindesiana

Manuscripts occupy a liminal position in many libraries, corporeally and
conceptually. Codices outwardly resemble their printed cousins, and it may be
convenient and practicable to collocate them on the same shelves. But manuscripts
also comprise an array of non-book formats, such as scrolls, parchment deeds and
single-sheet documents, which demand separate, specialized accommodation
(although collectors have often attempted to ‘discipline’ such heterodox material
and make it physically conform to the codex archetype, for instance through the
practices of binding loose-leaf items and dressing Oriental manuscripts in European
covers). In conceptual terms manuscripts may be collected and valued for their
informational content, in a manner similar to printed books; alternatively their arthistorical significance may be paramount, illumination translating them from the
field of bibliography to that of fine art; or they may function as historical curiosities,
conversation pieces, and fetishized relics of great men and women. 78 In these cases,
collectors may choose to locate their manuscripts (materially and/or noetically) in
the context of a picture gallery or cabinet of curiosities, rather than a library
proper. 79 In fact, I shall show that Lindsay adopted a hybrid approach, situating his
manuscripts within the body of the library, but displaying them from time to time
in the contingent, mutable space of his ‘Museum’.

87

There is a paucity of evidence for the physical and intellectual positioning of
manuscripts within private libraries in the nineteenth century. Auctioneers’
catalogues and other published descriptions of such collections (often compiled in
anticipation of or subsequent to a collection’s dispersion or transfer of ownership)
tended both to treat manuscripts and printed books promiscuously (especially
when manuscripts constituted a small proportion of a collection), and to impose an
extrinsic order, disregarding any arrangement applied by the owners. In any case,
manuscripts themselves resist unambiguous categorization and classification,
because of the fluidity of their content and structure. Thus it was often expedient
for catalogues to be arranged alphabetically (such as the collections of William
Bragge, Thomas Corser and Henry Huth), or according to Brunet’s divisions or
similar categorizations (exemplified by the collections of William Tyssen-Amherst
and Frank McClean). 80 A further complication is that some collectors (notably John
Ruskin and Henry Yates Thompson) were continually acquiring and disposing of
manuscripts, and their collections were therefore inherently unstable. 81 Lord
Ashburnham’s outstanding collection of manuscripts is one of the few whose
arrangement is well documented. The four major sections of the collection – the
Libri, Barrois, Stowe and Appendix manuscripts – were distinguished by different
coloured spine labels. The Libri, Barrois and Appendix manuscripts were interfiled
in two sequences, arranged roughly by subject, while the Stowe collection was
shelved separately, as were the printed books. 82
The Bibliotheca Lindesiana constitutes an interesting case-study of a hybrid printmanuscript collection in which the organization and status of the manuscripts

The Tyssen-Amherst catalogue records: ‘It was first proposed to make a separate section

for the manuscripts; but the specimens under description being nearly all closely connected
with printed books also in the library, it has seemed more advisable to place them at the
beginning of each section.’ Seymour de Ricci, A Hand-List of a Collection of Books and
Manuscripts Belonging to the Right Hon. Lord Amherst of Hackney (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1906), p. 61.

shifted over time. Lindsay claimed not to be a collector of manuscripts per se. As I
explain later, he was obliged to acquire Oriental manuscripts in order to document
the cultures of the East, because of their late adoption of printing. By contrast, he
averred that his Western manuscripts were limited to ‘a few valuable specimens
illustrative of the calligraphy of different ages and countries’. 83 Lindsay
distinguished himself from other nineteenth-century manuscript collectors, such as
his brother-in-law Robert Holford, by eschewing the obvious attractions of
illuminated manuscripts. He thus conformed with Naudé’s advice that one should
not collect manuscripts of works already printed, and that ‘il faut negliger [sic] tous
ces livres & Manuscrits qui ne sont prisez que pour le respect de leur antiquité,
figures, peintures, relieures, & autres foibles considerations [sic].’ 84 Lindsay
professed that his ambitions in this field were strictly limited:
I may perhaps buy a few other MSS. on the score of beauty in writing or
illumination, but the above constitute the series which I have proposed to
myself to procure as specimens of the principal styles and epochs of
calligraphy. A Manuscript library, such as that of Sir Thomas Phillipps or
Lord Ashburnham, has a value and a charm inexpressibly attractive; but I
have never directed ^bent^ my thoughts in that direction, and in so far as I
may have the means of collecting, over and above the range of our
typographical library, it will be in the direction of Art […] 85
Those individual manuscripts that Lindsay did acquire were generally assigned to
the ‘Museum or curiosity’ department of the library, which comprised ‘monuments
in the history, not so much of thought and literature as of bibliography’. 86 Lindsay
enumerates those ‘few valuable specimens illustrative of the calligraphy of different
ages and countries’ that constitute the Museum. In the Wunderkammer tradition,
the list is striking for its eclecticism: thirty-three Oriental manuscripts, including

Hieroglyphic, Ethiopic, Persian, Sanskrit, Javanese, Chinese and Tibetan
manuscripts, and fifteen Western codices, ranging from the eighth century to the
fifteenth. His desiderata are likewise modest, including ‘A fine Papyrus’ (‘two or
three that I brought from Egypt having fallen to pieces’), ‘a good Coptic MS.’, ‘an
Arabic MS. in the old Cufic character’, and ‘a good Anglo-Saxon MS.’ 87 He also
intends the Museum to contain a selection of autograph letters and charters,
specimens of Chinese xylography, European blockbooks, a selection of incunabula
and later printed works chosen ‘to illustrate the progress of printing down to the
present time’, and ‘a few fine specimens of the Bibliopegistic Art’. 88 However, he is
adamant that the Museum, unlike a cabinet of curiosities, should not constitute a
physically distinct department:
I do not, let me add, intend by the word ‘Museum’ to imply a collection to be
kept separate and distinct from the Library; but simply such a series of
volumes, chosen rather for their bibliographical curiosity than their
usefulness for purposes of study, as may on special occasions be brought out
and so arranged as to constitute a ‘Museum’, of pro tempore
extemporisation, full of interest and instruction. 89

In sketching proposals for his idealized library at Dunecht, Lindsay rehearses how
he envisages the Museum functioning:
I should propose that some cases, glazed and with lock and key, should be
constructed for the purpose of exhibiting on particular occasions the more
interesting of our books and manuscripts, in the manner which has been
adopted in the British Museum and elsewhere. These might be kept in some
separate quarter except when wanted, and should then be ranged at
intervals along the sides of the room, filled with books or other objects
selected for their interest or importance. […] The effect of this would be to
form, from time to time, a portion of the Library, selected for the occasion,
into the ‘Museum’ which I have so often spoken of. 90
The impermanence of the Museum, I argue, reflects not only the ambivalence of the
material that it was intended to house, but also the contradictions in Lindsay’s own
attitude towards these special items. As I have observed, manuscripts and other
‘valuable specimens’ defied unproblematic classification as bibliographical items:
analogous to but distinguishable from printed books. Thus they could neither be
fully incorporated within the library, nor entirely divorced from it. Lindsay claimed
to value manuscripts less as textual witnesses than as representative examples of the
various scriptoria and schools of illumination. He also privileged later, more
authoritative printed editions over incunabula, treating the latter rather as
landmarks of typography: ‘when mere and simple rarity is the sole characteristic of
a book – when it is not the first edition, nor the best, nor in any way distinguishable
for merit or beauty – then, although not insensible to the charms of the
bibliomaniacal Circe, I have withstood her spell, and rejected it.’ 91 However, there is
arguably an element of special pleading here. On the one hand, Lindsay deprecated
the ‘cabinet’ style of collecting, and claimed that the library was founded upon
utility. Yet, when it suited, he was able to justify to himself acquiring a 42-line Bible,
a First Folio, and a number of outstanding illuminated manuscripts. 92 This elasticity

Lindsay admitted: ‘my view of utility has been a broader and more generous one than that

91

of policy and practice could be accommodated by the temporality of the Museum,
which was untrammelled by rigid categorization and physical demarcation.
Furthermore, the extemporization and asynchrony of Lindsay’s museum are
features of the amateurism which I touched upon earlier; as Carolyn Dinshaw
argues, ‘[a]mateur temporality starts and stops at will […] amateurs can enjoy the
chance irruptions that occur when all is not synched up’, in contrast to the linearity
and regularity of professionalism. 93
In the decade after he compiled the Library Report, Lindsay purchased a significant
number of important manuscripts, both Western and Oriental, including Nicolas de
Lyra’s Postilla, the Colonna Missal, the Joan of Navarre Psalter, the Prüm
Lectionary, the Forme of Cury, and an outstanding Haggadah, as well as the
hundreds of Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Coptic, Ethiopic and Samaritan manuscripts
from the collections of Nathaniel Bland, Duncan Forbes, George Hamilton and
Henry Tattam. While he continued to assert that he did not collect manuscripts qua
manuscripts, he certainly adopted a more catholic approach towards their
acquisition.
When Ludovic assumed control of the library, he initially adhered to his father’s
cautious policy with regard to manuscripts, no doubt to Quaritch’s disappointment:
‘I have not in any sense a MS library, nor do I wish greatly to extend my field in that
direction at the present time, excepting perhaps on specimens of really remote
antiquity and equal beauty of illumination and execution.’ 94 However, he was more
susceptible to the allure of spectacular items, such as the folio copy of Lydgate’s
Troy Book, which Quaritch had repeatedly tried to persuade his father to buy, and
he soon fell under the spell of manuscripts, especially early codices. 95 During the
decade from 1884 he acquired many important manuscripts in the glittering series
of the mere utilitarian.’ LR, Epilogue, p. 1.

of sales that marked this era: those of François Vergauwen, the earl of Jersey
(Osterley Park), Bateman of Youlgrave, Andrew Fountaine, Howel Wills and Stuart
of Aldenham. As the manuscript collections grew, they gradually sedimented out
from the printed books, forming discrete sections of the library, arranged by
language. While Ludovic continued to exhibit the manuscripts regularly, both at
Haigh Hall and elsewhere, Lindsay’s concept of an extempore ‘Museum’ was no
longer discussed: the manuscripts’ position within the Bibliotheca Lindesiana,
although remaining distinct, was now firmly consolidated. They were also subject to
an increasingly professionalized management, as I shall explore in the next section.

2.6

Professionalization and Distancing: Reorganization of the Library
under Ludovic

While library classification schemes cannot be said to have preoccupied Ludovic in
the way that they absorbed his father’s attention, they did appeal to his scientific
mind. Indeed, he was responsible for one of the earliest applications in Britain of
the decimal classification system devised by Melvil Dewey at Amherst College: only
three years after Dewey published his scheme in 1876, and years before its
widespread acceptance in Britain, Ludovic adopted and expanded it in order to
classify the astronomical library at Dunecht Observatory. 96 Alert to the innovation
of this modified Dewey scheme and its potential application in other scientific
libraries, Ludovic printed and circulated a limited edition of his classification and
index. In the introduction he explains his adaptations to Dewey’s basic scheme:

93

On examining the classes devoted to my special subjects in Mr. Dewey’s
arrangement, I found several points upon which I differed from him, notably
in his arrangement of Astronomy. These I have altered without scruple, and, I
venture to hope, without detriment. The original form of Mr. Dewey’s
Classing extends to three figures of decimals. My case being that of a
Specialist, I have added a figure, thereby increasing the field for work
tenfold. 97
It is as though Ludovic has inverted his giant telescope to focus on the microscopic
gradations of classification.
The Bibliotheca Lindesiana was the creature of Lindsay and earlier I noted the
closeness with which it mapped onto his mind. It was perhaps inevitable that
Ludovic could not attain his father’s intellectual mastery over the library nor match
his degree of self-identification with it. In 1884 he embarked upon an ambitious
project to write a history of the library. Like his father’s Report, it was to be
structured upon ‘the familiar classification of Brunet and the French
Bibliographers’. However, he abandoned it after seventy-four pages, part-way
through the first section; it was essentially a reworking of the Report, with passages
repeated verbatim, a disappointing postscript to Lindsay’s magnum opus. 98
Ludovic did institute improvements to the organization of the library, which
appears to have been neglected during Lindsay’s final years. While his father was
still alive, Ludovic had purchased several thousand catalogue cards, some ‘American
revolving bookcases’ and several works on the organization and management of
libraries. 99 He cut up the folio sheets upon which his father had pasted the
accession slips, to create a single alphabetical sequence instead of five. ‘I never
regretted the labour this reducing work caused me, as thereby I learnt whether a

book already existed and to a very great extent the whereabouts in the house to
look for it.’ 100
However, Ludovic was unable or unwilling to devote sufficient attention to the
management of the library and eventually recognized the need for professional
assistance: to impose order on a collection grown unwieldy through rapid
expansion; to tackle the backlogs of cataloguing and binding; to pursue dilatory
suppliers of journals and serial publications; to respond to the almost daily offers of
material from British and overseas booksellers; and to handle the frequent enquiries
he received from scholars, fellow collectors and the plain curious. The decision to
appoint John Philip Edmond (1850‒1906) as full-time librarian in 1891 placed the
library on a more professional footing, but it also had the (presumably intended)
consequence of distancing Ludovic from its day-to-day operations, freeing him to
pursue other interests, in contrast to his father, for whom the library was his chief
avocation. Edmond had made his reputation at Sion College, where he reorganized
the library according to the classification schemes of Brunet and Dewey, an
initiative which no doubt recommended him to Ludovic. From 1888 Edmond had
also assisted on a part-time basis with the publication of Ludovic’s Catalogue of
English Ballads and Handlist of Proclamations. 101
While there were particular circumstances which motivated Ludovic to appoint
Edmond, the decision must be located within the context of the professionalization
of libraries – among many other spheres of activity – during the late nineteenth

century. W. J. Reader and other scholars have identified trends during the second
half of the century of increasing specialization and bureaucratization in the natural
sciences, other intellectual disciplines and the professions, in response to the
explosion of knowledge and the increasing complexity of capitalist society. 102
Intellectual authority became institutionalized within the academy, marginalizing
lone scholars; by the 1890s, the era of gentlemen-savants such as Lindsay was
over. 103
The defining characteristics of professionalization are control of entry into the
profession, by means of widely recognized qualifications and membership of a body
representing the interests of the profession and its members; the establishment and
enforcement of standards of conduct and expertise; the formulation of a specialized
vocabulary with which to conduct professional discourse; and a shared sense of
identity and common interest among the members of the profession, vis-à-vis
themselves and in contradistinction to outsiders. In the case of libraries, nascent
professionalism developed in the last quarter of the century: the Library Association
was founded in 1877, examinations were introduced in 1885, it obtained a Royal
Charter in 1898 (when Ludovic was president), and the Library Association Record
was first published in the following year, edited by Henry Guppy. However, one
should exaggerate neither the influence of the Association nor the speed and extent
of the professionalization of libraries in this period. In 1891 membership of the
Association stood at 454, of whom only 187 were librarians; it would be another two
decades before librarians comprised the majority of members; professional
examinations were poorly attended; pay was generally low; and the first full-time
training course for librarians was not established in Britain until 1919. The
boundaries of the profession remained permeable and its status and self-confidence
depressed well into the twentieth century. 104 It may therefore be argued that when

Ludovic appointed Edmond in 1891, he was in the vanguard of the
professionalization of libraries.
Edmond immediately set about imposing Benjamin’s ‘mild boredom of order’ upon
the library. He embarked upon a reclassification programme according to the
Dewey system and, as I noted earlier, he arranged the manuscripts by language,
protecting the more valuable ones in glass-fronted bookcases. Edmond
simultaneously addressed the backlog of uncatalogued material. He tackled the
early printed books himself, 105 but his expertise did not encompass all the languages
represented in the library and he found it necessary to continue the practice of
entrusting manuscripts to experts in Britain and abroad for identification and
cataloguing. Soon after Ludovic took charge of the library, he conceived a plan to
publish the various hand-lists of the manuscript collections as a single catalogue.
Quaritch deputed his senior assistant, Michael Kerney, to edit it, and proposed a
tripartite structure – Biblical manuscripts, Oriental manuscripts and European
manuscripts – which reflected the traditional privileging of Christian texts. 106 They
went so far as to print trial pages, but it became apparent that revision would be
required to impose consistency upon the work of the several cataloguers. 107 There
the matter lay until Edmond could take in hand Kerney’s catalogue of Arabic,
Persian and Turkish manuscripts. He impressed upon Ludovic the significance of
the Oriental manuscripts, telling him that they exceeded in number the combined

Arthur Munford, A History of the Library Association, 1877‒1977 (London: Library
Association, 1996). Munford (p. 43) and Black (pp. 195‒6) note that in 1885, the first year in
which the Library Association held examinations, only two second-class certificates were
awarded, and in some subsequent years there were no entrants at all.

holdings of all the principal American libraries. 108 In April 1893 Edmond reported
that he would soon be ready to start printing. Unfortunately, when the proofs came
back from Aberdeen University Press they were found to be full of errors, and
Kerney’s Hand-list of Oriental Manuscripts was not published until 1898. 109
While imposing intellectual order upon the library, Edmond simultaneously
addressed the concomitant and imperative need to improve its housing and
preservation. He bombarded bookbinders with a stream of instructions for binding
periodical parts, making phase boxes and portfolios for proclamations and other
single-sheet documents, and undertaking general repairs and rebinding. He began
his career in his father’s Aberdeen bindery and had an insider’s knowledge of the
trade; bookbinders quickly learned that they could not hoodwink him with inflated
charges or second-rate work. Quaritch’s and Lindsay’s preferred binder, Francis
Bedford, had died in 1883. Subsequently the West-End bindery of Zaehnsdorf
received the majority of orders from Haigh, but Edmond became dissatisfied with
the standard of their workmanship. He increasingly relied upon the Liverpool firm
of John Fazakerley, conveniently close to Haigh, for the routine business of binding
periodicals and making boxes. ‘Faz.’s lassies’, as Edmond dubbed the women
sewers, were also employed to bind up Bal’s private correspondence and his
collection of autographs; presumably they could be trusted with confidential
material because they were semi-literate. 110
Despite Edmond’s best endeavours, controlling the ever-growing library proved an
enormous challenge. In 1894 Bal quipped to his father:
The Shelf problem, like the Poor, is ever with us. Edmond & I went down to
the Billiard Room & shook our heads gravely. There is a perfect constipation

from the binders, which will necessarily involve the removal of books
appertaining to the new and vulgar world called America. The folio tracts are
still lying in Edmond’s room, some scores of hundreds. If however you value
your domestic peace, do not suggest the annexation of the morning room in
the presence of your countess. 111
Ludovic therefore acceded to Edmond’s requests for the appointment of assistants,
and by 1900 half a dozen members of staff were engaged in accessioning,
organizing, cataloguing and indexing vast quantities of books and other material. 112
This professionalization further distanced Ludovic from the quotidian life of the
library, and exposed the tensions latent within a family collection that in its scale
and modes of operation emulated the largest academic libraries in Britain. 113 Thus
when Ludovic died in 1913 and his son was compelled to institute economies, he felt
no compunction in dismissing the librarians. Bal confided in his diary:
One thing is necessary, namely a dispersal of the Library staff. I confess my
decision has caused no regrets in the family, because bibliography was
carried to a point so close to the professional that sometimes it appeared as
though Haigh existed for the Librarians and that nurses, children,
perambulators etc. were interlopers […]. The administrative cost apart from
purchases and binding has amounted to something like £1,500 a year and the

very fact of having from four to six men in the house is an infallible incentive
to buying – I can’t afford to buy […]. 114
This passage reveals the paradox of a family library organized along professional
lines. Moreover, the professionalization of libraries, which Ludovic had promoted,
both in his own collection and more widely as president of the Library Association,
collided with the economic and social decline of the aristocracy in the twentieth
century. It was impossible for the Lindsays to compete with the larger municipal
and university libraries in Britain, as well as the private libraries of American
magnates such as Morgan and Huntington, which were now in the forefront of the
development of libraries and of library science. 115 The days of the great private
libraries were numbered, at least in Britain. Through financial necessity rather than
natural inclination, Bal was obliged to revert to his grandfather’s practice of
managing the library himself.

2.7

Conclusion

In response to the threat of ‘information overload’, both Lindsay and Ludovic
demonstrated an active interest in the theory and principles of library classification,
to a degree perhaps unequalled amongst private collectors in the nineteenth
century. Lindsay made extensive studies of the history of classification and
developed his own organizational systems, which reveal the tensions between
idealized taxonomies, grounded in theories of the organization of knowledge, and
practical library schemes that can be applied to actual collections in order to
facilitate the retrieval of information. Lindsay’s first endeavours were founded upon
his philosophical and historical theorems (in particular the concept of ‘progression
by antagonism’), and consequently were wholly impractical. Later he synthesized
the work of French bibliographers to produce a more serviceable scheme in the
Library Report. Lindsay’s competing impulses towards classification and catholicity
illuminate wider contemporary debates over the relative merits of specialization
and generalism. He epitomized the gentleman-scholar, who was gradually
marginalized as disciplines were institutionalized within the academy.

100

I have demonstrated that the formation of Lindsay’s social and cultural distinction
was closely allied to his interest in the classification of libraries and to the
organization of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana in particular. On the other hand, while
Orientalism was generally implicated in the organization of libraries, Lindsay’s
enlightened attitude towards non-Western cultures resulted in a high degree of
physical and intellectual integration between European and Oriental materials.
Manuscripts occupied an uncertain, liminal position within the library, assigned to
the impermanent ‘Museum or curiosity’ department, reflecting their ambiguous
status and Lindsay’s ambivalent attitude towards them. However, as the manuscript
collections grew, especially under Ludovic’s hegemony, they gradually precipitated
out from the printed books to form discrete sections of the library.
Lindsay’s direct control of the library and his reliance on memory as the primary
ideational device hark back to the early modern library, which Garberson has
shown to be grounded in the classical memorative tradition and ‘was conceived and
functioned as a memory aid’. 116 Following Ludovic’s succession, several
developments in the management of the library reflected wider socio-economic
trends towards greater scientificity, bureaucratization and specialization. The
Oriental collections were subjected to more intensive classification and segregation,
analogous to Anderson’s ‘totalizing classificatory grid’ within the colonial contact
zone. Ludovic relinquished day-to-day management of the library in favour of a
cohort of professional staff, and exercised control vicariously, via documentary
systems and administrative procedures, rather than through personal memory and
direct, haptic experience. Thus the Bibliotheca Lindesiana exemplified (indeed
pioneered) the development of the modern, scientifically organized and
professional library, to an extent that was ultimately unsustainable in the context of
the aristocracy’s economic and social decline in the twentieth century, an issue that
I address in Chapters 3 and 5 below.

3 Et amicorum: Situating the Bibliotheca Lindesiana within
the Field of Cultural Production

3.1

Introduction

The Bibliotheca Lindesiana was a site of knowledge formation. Knowledge was
created through the assemblage of rare books and manuscripts, through their study
by Lindsay and others, and, as the preceding chapter demonstrated, through their
organization and classification. However, Foucault has shown that knowledge is
socially constructed, and it is thus essential to locate the library within the wider
landscape of knowledge communities and communities of connoisseurship and
collecting. As a major collector of books and manuscripts, Lindsay established and
maintained relationships with fellow collectors and bibliophiles, scholars, librarians
and dealers, who engaged with him and informed the development and use of the
library, as collaborators and competitors, expert advisers and researchers,
cataloguers and suppliers. I shall now examine these nexuses, considering how
Lindsay classified and positioned himself within the field of cultural production,
especially in the locale of manuscript collecting, and how his identity and
distinction as an elite collector were fashioned through these relationships. It is also
illuminating to contrast Lindsay’s networks with those in which his son and
grandson, Ludovic and Bal, participated towards the end of the century; a
diachronic approach will reveal wider trends in bibliophilic networks and the field
of cultural production.
The questions that this chapter addresses are: How was bibliophilic sociability
instantiated in formal and informal networks of collectors during the midnineteenth century, and how and to what extent was Lindsay implicated in these
networks? How successful was he in reconciling his innate shyness with his
professed commitment to making the library accessible to his amici in the
aristocratic tradition of Jean Grolier? Where was he positioned between the poles of
manly homosociality and its counterpoint, effeminacy, of which a scholar-collector
was prone to suspicion? And how did Ludovic and Bal differ from Lindsay in their
integration into bibliophilic and wider cultural networks?
106

I also investigate the important role of dealers, notably Bernard Quaritch, in the
development of the library. The earls’ relationships with them were markedly
unequal in terms of their respective financial, cultural and social capitals:
booksellers were irredeemably classed as ‘trade’. Yet leading dealers’ expertise and
their extensive commercial networks created a mutual dependency with their elite
customers, thus problematizing the rigid social hierarchies of Victorian society.
Lindsay’s relationship with Quaritch is contextualized through comparison with
other customers such as John Ruskin and William Tyssen-Amherst. Ludovic and Bal
had much looser, more business-like relationships with suppliers, and I propose
that in adopting a more independent approach they were differentiating themselves
from bourgeois collectors who relied heavily upon expert dealers and connoisseurs
to shape and confirm their taste. 1
The earls’ relationships with fellow collectors and dealers converged in the
saleroom. I investigate how the earls engaged in auctions, both directly and
vicariously, examining the tactics that they and their agents deployed, as well as the
wider socio-cultural significance of auctions, which ostensibly functioned as
instruments of plutocracy in a period when the aristocracy’s social, economic and
political influences were waning. I consider how Lindsay demonstrated his taste and
cultivated manners in his engagements with auctions, whereas his agent, Quaritch,
could be ferocious towards his opponents. Ludovic and Bal, by contrast, personally
participated in auctions, again distancing themselves from their bourgeois
competitors. However, through direct involvement in the plutocratic milieu of
auctions they risked contaminating themselves with bourgeois manners and
diminishing their aristocratic distinction.

3.2

‘Secluded habits and want of acquaintance’: Lord Lindsay and
Bibliophilic Networks

Formal networks or societies of (male) bibliophiles proliferated during the
nineteenth century, although bibliographical societies combining the interests of
1

I follow Hobsbawm’s definition of the bourgeoisie as ‘a body of persons of power and

influence, independent of the power and influence of traditional birth and status’. Eric J.
Hobsbawm, The Age of Capital, 1848‒1875 (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1975), p. 286.

107

collectors, bibliographers and scholars did not develop until the end of the century.2
Collectors’ clubs satisfied a desire for homosociality, provided a forum for
knowledge-exchange, emulation and competition amongst collectors, and
performed a legitimating and normalizing role, as Pearce asserts: ‘Collecting […] is
regarded with some ambivalence by society at large, but within the group a
collecting norm can be established, which is supportive and nourishing. Clubs have
their own kind of legitimacy.’ 3 Societies functioned as ‘imagined communities’,
conceptually uniting geographically dispersed collectors, who might congregate
only rarely, through shared interests and mutual identification. David Matthews
points out that clubs fostered a sense of community as much by exclusion and
absence as by inclusion. 4 Exclusion on grounds of gender, nationality, social class
and/or cultural capital did not need to be overt: self-exclusion operated, typifying
Bourdieu’s ‘symbolic violence’. Being the ‘right sort’ was a prerequisite for
membership and anyone lacking sufficient capital and an appropriate habitus was
unlikely to apply in the first place. In thus enforcing and reinforcing distinction,
elite bibliophilic and collectors’ groups discharged a similar function to the
metropolitan gentlemen’s clubs, membership of which was, Amy Milne-Smith
argues, a visible sign of social status in a period when class identities required
continual reinforcement. 5 This was a period of growing social fluidity, when the
aristocracy’s role was being challenged, ‘new men’ were entering its ranks and the
term ‘gentleman’ was an increasingly contested signifier. Status markers such as
membership of elite clubs therefore assumed great importance.

The Roxburghe Club, oldest and most exclusive of bibliophilic societies, was
founded to commemorate the sale of the Duke of Roxburghe’s library in 1812; its
name proclaimed aristocratic bibliomania and its membership ‘cemented the
somewhat feudal relations between aristocrats and aspiring litterateurs’. 6 Other
associations in which book collectors figured prominently included the Society of
Antiquaries of London, its Edinburgh counterpart, and the trio of Scottish
antiquarian clubs founded in the early nineteenth century – Bannatyne (1823),
Maitland (1828) and Spalding (1839) – although these fulfilled primarily a publishing
rather than a social function. 7 The Philobiblon Society, founded by Richard
Monckton Milnes and others in 1853, restricted itself to a patron and thirty-five
elected members interested in ‘the history, collection, or peculiarities of Books’. As
well as printing limited-edition Miscellanies, the Society organized bibliographical
breakfasts at members’ homes during the London Season. Manuscript collectors
such as James Crossley, Robert Curzon, Robert Holford, Henry Huth and Walter
Sneyd featured prominently amongst the membership. 8 Likewise the Burlington
Fine Arts Club, whose objects were ‘to bring together Amateurs, Collectors, and
others interested in Art’ and ‘to provide accommodation for showing and
comparing rare works in the possession of the Members and their friends’, counted
many collectors or owners of manuscripts within its ranks, including Bragge,
Curzon, Holford, Huth, Ferdinand de Rothschild, Ruskin and Sneyd. The
Burlington’s membership was comparatively large, standing at 343 in 1878, but its
social composition was strictly controlled: proposers of new members were required
to certify ‘from personal knowledge that the Gentleman proposed will, from his
social position, as well as from his cultivated taste, interest in Art, or other
qualifications, be a desirable Member of the Burlington Fine Arts Club’. Art dealers

were specifically excluded. On the other hand, there were comparatively few peers
among the membership: this was a club primarily for entrants into the bourgeoisie
who wished to demonstrate their wealth and refined taste in the competitive
environment of the Burlington’s displays. 9 The club thus exemplified Bourdieu’s
thesis that the bourgeoisie use culture to normalize and legitimate their privileged
position, since they cannot invoke right of birth, ‘which their class […] has refused
to the aristocracy’. 10
Lindsay was a member of neither the Roxburghe nor the Burlington clubs. While
his absence from the latter is unsurprising, for the reason just outlined, Lindsay’s
aristocratic pedigree, connoisseurship and pre-eminence as a collector made him an
ideal candidate for the Roxburghe. Francis Wrangham, a member who took a
paternalistic interest in Lindsay as both a fellow poet and a collector of similar
outlook, offered to nominate him for election in 1841, but Lindsay demurred:
my pursuits and collections are more of an historical and (so far as belles
lettres are concerned) modern character than those of your eminent
colleagues. Indeed some years ago, when it was proposed to me to join the
Maitland and Abbotsford club, I determined to content myself with the
honour of being a member of the Bannatyne and to purchase as the

add to my collection. 11
Phillipps and Ashburnham were other notable absentees from the Roxburghe lists.
Ashburnham was a man of ‘glacial hauteur’, ‘rather calculated to inspire fear than
love or respect to those he came in contact with’, while Munby argues that Phillipps
was ‘much too busy collecting books to think it worth while to join a body that was
merely sociable about them. […] It was very much in character for so professional a
book-buyer to distrust those he conceived to be dilettanti.’ 12
While Lindsay subscribed to the Bannatyne Club, Spalding Club, Arundel Society
and Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, his involvement in their affairs was minimal:
membership was purely a means to obtain their publications rather than an
opportunity to commune with like-minded antiquaries and collectors. 13 Tanya
Ledger notes that Lindsay was ‘the most learned historian of art’ on the council of
the Arundel Society, yet ‘clearly he had not expected to play an active part in the
running of the Society for when it emerged in 1851 that this was required, he
promptly resigned.’ 14 In 1852, when he was elected in absentia to the committee of
the Bannatyne, he told the club’s secretary, David Laing, that he was compelled to
decline ‘from not being well & other circumstances […] & I do not like to undertake

any office without giving it due attention.’ Two years later, when Laing informed
him that he had been elected vice-president of the club, Lindsay once more refused
the honour: ‘having been much overworked for several years past, repose is
necessary and indeed prescribed to me; I have for some time therefore been
endeavouring to lessen the number of my engagements.’ 15
In Lindsay’s case, it was not so much hauteur or contempt for ‘dilettanti’ that
dissuaded him from joining the Roxburghe and other collectors’ clubs, but an
assured, well-formed habitus that required no corroboration from formal
association with fellow collectors, combined with his acute shyness and life-long
aversion to company, and an abhorrence of committees and offices. Lindsay refused
invitations to be a trustee of the National Gallery and the British Museum, telling
Gladstone that ‘my secluded habits & want of acquaintance (partly the result of
great shortsightedness) with other men of standing in London, disqualify me to a
great degree from any similar duty.’ 16 Moreover, as I previously observed, Lindsay
constructed his library on (liberally construed) utilitarian principles and never
regarded collecting as an end in itself. He thus had little time for the formal
accoutrements and rituals of collecting celebrated by the clubs.
While clubs and societies constituted the formal structures of bibliographical
sociability, in common with most other collectors Lindsay developed a network of
more informal, individualized relationships with fellow bibliophiles and scholars.
He was situated within an ancient tradition of book collecting and sociability that
reached back at least to Jean Grolier (1489/90‒1565), whose famous motto ‘et
amicorum’ proclaimed his munificence and echoed classical antecedents. 17 Thomas

Mahieu (Maiolus), secretary to Catherine de’ Medici, was one of several other early
modern collectors who adopted the same adage. Dibdin, panegyrist of bibliophilic
sociability, assumed that his nineteenth-century audience was ‘intimately versed’ in
the contents of Grolier’s library; likewise, Mahieu was ‘eagerly hunted after by
modern bibliomaniacs’. 18 In the Library Report, Lindsay invokes Grolier and Mahieu
as archetypes of elite bibliophily, collectors who generously opened their libraries to
friends and associates:
Nor ought such a library to be limited to a family only; the friends of the
family, and those whose friendship would do them honour, ought equally to
have access to it; and in our own case the motto on its every volume should
virtually be, like that on the books of Grolier and Maioli,
LINDESIORUM PRINCIPIS,
COMITIS CRAFORDIAE,
ET AMICORUM. 19
There were numerous instances of Lindsay’s generosity in accommodating requests
for access to specific manuscripts and books, whether at Haigh or by lending
material out. Likewise, Ludovic advocated a liberal loan policy to his librarian: ‘You

can take this as general – where a Gov[ernmen]t or reputable society or individual

There is extensive literature on bibliophilic sociability in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, yet only recently have any studies been informed by sociocultural theory or been grounded in detailed empirical data. In his sensitive
exploration of reading and the circulation of books during the Scottish
Enlightenment, Mark Towsey has uncovered pervasive practices of informal book
lending and discussions of literature, concluding that ‘the family library was one of
the main focuses of genteel sociability in rural Scotland, with “privy” borrowing
readily extending to other neighbouring families.’ Likewise, Edward Potten
concludes that the extensive private library of Charles Winn at Nostell Priory
‘played an important role in the wider intellectual life of the local community’. 21
In fact, Victorian private libraries were arenas in which competing demands for
openness and closure were played out. Libraries served as private spaces,
sanctuaries from society and sites for solitary, contemplative study, while less
honourable motives such as possessiveness and paranoia prompted some owners
(most notably Lord Ashburnham) to restrict others’ access to their libraries.
Conversely, altruism, duty or sociability induced many proprietors to share their
collections with associates and fellow collectors, whereas competitiveness and
vanity were additional motivations for exposing libraries to the gaze of others. 22
Lindsay’s attitude towards his library manifests these tensions. While he professed
to have constructed it to serve the needs of his family and friends and of the wider

scholarly community, and he was indeed generous in making the library accessible,
in practice the library appears to have been little known and little used outside the
family and a narrow circle of bibliographical experts. His mother-in-law, Lady Anne
Lindsay, complained to Min: ‘Nobody, at least not many people know what a
wonderful library it is. And that vexes me.’ 23 He became so absorbed in the library
and in his bibliographical and historical studies that he neglected his social
networks. Anne lamented his lack of sociability: ‘Minny is truly a happy woman, her
only trial is her husband’s increasing dislike of society and his over tasking his mind
by sitting for hours over his peculiar pursuits.’ On another occasion she quipped:
‘Coutts is gone with Min to the Herberts at Wilton. Lindsay would not go. He is
getting worse and worse and soon will be fit for nothing but being bound up in
Russia leather and stuck up on the Haigh library shelves.’ 24 Lindsay was never
happier than when ‘entomed’ in his library, as Anne commented: ‘It is such a
pleasure to see him walking about singing and arranging his new Library.’ 25
Lindsay thus conformed to Daniel Cook’s model of the solitary scholar: ‘the
scholar’s library entails separation in several senses both physical and ideal. […]
books form a literal carapace insulating the scholar from the outside world – and
perhaps even from the distractions of home life.’ 26 However, Lindsay’s preference to
be a gentleman-savant clashed with the demands of aristocratic sociability.
Although the vir civiliter eruditus had classical antecedents and aristocratic
dilettanti and amateur scientists made important contributions to knowledge in the
eighteenth century, in the second half of the nineteenth century the roles of
gentleman and scholar became increasingly incompatible. 27 As a result of the

specialist research facilities, libraries, and, above all, large amounts of time to
undertake research and develop their expertise; this conflicted with the protracted
rituals and rigid structures of elite sociability. 28
I earlier discussed Lindsay’s unfulfilled ambition to relocate the library from Haigh
Hall to Dunecht. In the Library Report he expounded his vision of creating a vast
library-room capable of accommodating the entire collection in a self-containing
space: ‘The Library thus constructed should bear an aspect, thoroughly comfortable
indeed, but still that of a sanctuary of learning and thought, sacred to the Muses,
where men and women may meet in converse on the common ground of graceful
cultivation.’ 29 Lindsay’s aspirations to establish a modern Platonic Academy
contained two contradictions. First, the library was to be ‘comfortable’, yet he
intended it for serious study, disdaining the casual inconsequence of many
Victorian country-house libraries where, according to Jennifer Ciro, guests wrote
their correspondence, read newspapers and traded gossip. 30 His library was to be
furnished with ‘writing tables with moveable desks, and strong column-desks for
the examination of very large volumes, […] book-stands with narrow shelves for very
large folio books of prints […] and large tables for the reception of Atlases and books
of constant reference’, rather than ottomans and sofas. 31 Secondly, he envisaged the
library as the centre of a community of scholars and thinkers (both men and
women), yet it was to be located in rural Aberdeenshire, remote from the worlds of
scholarship and letters. Lindsay’s dream was never realized; perhaps he reflected
that this escapist fantasy of splendid isolation would have conflicted with his

gentlemanly obligations to make the library accessible beyond the immediate
family.
Lindsay’s vision of a library where ‘men and women may meet in converse’ was
notably progressive for this period, when women were effectively excluded from
most institutional libraries. Ciro argues that during the nineteenth century both
architecturally and performatively the private library became an increasingly public,
social and less gendered space within the complex organism of the Victorian
country house: it was transformed into one of the principal reception rooms, into
which it became more socially acceptable for women to enter. 32 However, at least
one contemporary source implied that women were only grudgingly admitted to the
country-house library. Robert Kerr, writing contemporaneously with the Library
Report, contended that the library was ‘primarily a sort of Morning-room for
gentlemen rather than anything else. Their correspondence is done here, their
reading, and, in some measure, their lounging […]. At the same time the ladies are
not exactly excluded.’ 33 The role of women in the Bibliotheca Lindesiana has
hitherto been disregarded – part of a wider elision of women from the history of
book collecting – but Lindsay’s wife Min and her mother, Anne Lindsay, exercised
considerable influence over the formation and development of the library. 34 Anne

sources; it is simply chasing its own tail.’

had nurtured his early interest in matters art-historical and bibliographical and had
encouraged his collecting practices, while Min became his coadjutor. The latter’s
role remains largely silent in the archive, but one can occasionally glimpse the
strength of their joint intellectual enterprise. For example, while holidaying at
Vichy, Lindsay recorded in his diary: ‘Min and I are reading German, she Niebuhr’s
Greek legends and I Chwolsohn’s book about the old Babylonian literature […] we
cross question each other and are very severe upon faults.’ 35 Neither work could be
regarded as light vacation reading. Likewise, when Lindsay secured a collection of
Samaritan manuscripts in 1872, he clearly expected his wife to share his enthusiasm:
‘Minnie, Minnie, Minnie!!! I have got a haul, you don’t know of what a valuable fish
– Samaritan manuscripts! They are rarer than black swans.’ 36
Lindsay developed and maintained relations with a number of individual collectors,
albeit spasmodic and couched in the formalities of Victorian social intercourse. He
owed some acquaintanceships to the booksellers Joseph Lilly and Bernard Quaritch,
whose shops drew bibliophiles, men of letters, academics, clergy and statesmen. For
example, Lilly persuaded Lindsay not to compete against one of his principal
customers, Henry Huth, for a copy of the Tyndale Pentateuch at the sale of Edward
Vernon Utterson’s books in March 1857. Huth thereby secured the Pentateuch for
only £130. This initiated ‘an occasional exchange of friendly bibliographical
courtesies’ between the two collectors. 37

The following year Lindsay supplied Huth with a leaf from his own copy of Foxe’s
Book of Martyrs, and in 1860 Huth was able to return the favour by presenting
Lindsay with the woodcut title-page. Huth requested Lilly ‘to convey to his
Lordship his acknowledgements for the courtesy shown him, and he avails himself
of the opportunity now afforded him to thank Lord Lindsay again very sincerely for
his great kindness.’ 38 He invited Lindsay to view his library at Princes Gate,
Kensington, the proposal being framed in the gentlemanly convention of selfdeprecation:
As many of my books, if not most of them, have been procured from Mr
Lilly, or through his instrumentality, he is perhaps not quite impartial in his
description of my library. As yet my library is small, numbering not much
above 3000 volumes, but I have taken great pains in the selection, and my
books are a source of very great pleasure to me. There are some among them
which are worthy of inspection by those who take interest in such things,
and I need not say that I should be happy to show them to your Lordship at
any time that may be convenient. 39
Seemingly to reinforce his claims to acquaintance, Huth reminded Lindsay that his
brother had been Lindsay’s companion at preparatory school, while Huth himself
(three years younger than Lindsay) had been at school with the latter’s brothers.
While their occasional correspondence developed real warmth – Huth addressing
him ‘Dear Lord Lindsay’ and signing off ‘Believe me your very truly’ – there is no
evidence that Lindsay ever met Huth or visited his library. Indeed, when Quaritch

portrait, ‘thinking your Lordship would like to know the sort of man Mr. Huth
looks, I am perhaps committing a gaucherie in showing the Portrait to your
Lordship. Mr Huth is a very reserved man, but every in[ch] a gentleman: liberal,
generous and enlightened.’ 40
Another major manuscript collector with whom Lindsay became acquainted was
Lord Ashburnham, albeit relatively late in their collecting careers. Belying his
fearsome reputation, Ashburnham treated Lindsay with the civility due to one who
was both his match as a bibliophile and his social peer. The two men met in the
spring of 1869 at the home of Lindsay’s brother-in-law and fellow manuscript
collector, Robert Holford. In May Ashburnham sent Lindsay a set of catalogues of
his manuscripts, and an invitation to Ashburnham Place followed. 41 Barker records
that Lindsay and Min took up the offer soon after Ludovic’s wedding in July. 42
However, the limits of Lindsay’s acquaintance were revealed in November when he
declined Quaritch’s request to intercede on behalf of the eccentric collector
Leonard Lawrie Hartley, who wished to obtain his own copy of a recent
Ashburnham catalogue: Lindsay ‘could hardly do so with propriety’, since ‘his
acquaintance with Lord Ashburnham does not extend beyond the merest
acquaintance, much less approaches to intimacy or friendship.’ He imputed
Ashburnham’s invitation ‘to a desire to shew some acknowledgement indirectly to
Mr Holford, and very likely he may never come in contact with Ld Ashburnham
again as there are no common friends between them’. 43
Lindsay established close friendships with only two fellow collectors. One was the
Scottish antiquary David Laing (1793‒1878), librarian of the Signet Library,

they discussed club business and aspects of Scottish history, while Lindsay
consulted the antiquary on points of his own family’s history. Book collecting rarely
figured in their discussions, but they regularly exchanged their own publications
and in 1866 they traded copies of the 1536 edition of Boece’s Scotorum historia, to
enable Lindsay to perfect his own copy. As Pearce has noted, throughout the history
of collecting, gift-giving and gift-exchange have been frequent devices for
cementing relationships between collectors: the gift demonstrates the taste and
refinement of the giver and sets up an obligation on the part of the recipient
appropriately to reciprocate; gift-exchange reinforces the mutual recognition of
both parties as fellow collectors. Indeed, according to actor-network theory, gift
objects themselves are agents of social relations, just as much as the human
actors. 45
Lindsay also enjoyed cordial relations with Robert Curzon (1810‒73), a particularly
genial character who charmed even the adamantine heart of Phillipps. Curzon
represented an older, more romantic model of book collecting, associated with the
Dibdinian era of bibliomania, whereas Lindsay, although only two years his junior,
epitomized the increasingly scientific approach to collecting and descriptive
bibliography that dominated the second half of the nineteenth century. 46 They met

at a dinner party in 1850 and, according to Lindsay, ‘had a little bibliographical chat
for just five minutes – he losing at once all his persiflage etc., and I enjoying what I
never enjoyed before, (for I never yet met with a kindred soul on that subject)’. 47
This parenthetical comment betrays the depth of Lindsay’s bibliophilic isolation.
Like Lindsay, Curzon had travelled extensively in Greece, Egypt and the Levant in
the 1830s, collecting venerable manuscripts, ‘the fruits of arduous field-work, of
dangerous journeys in bandit-infested countries, of interminable parleys with
suspicious monks’, and no doubt this shared experience helped to break down
Lindsay’s reserve and cement their relationship. 48 In 1859 Lindsay told Quaritch
that he had given a ‘very curious’ manuscript of the Bhagavata Purana ‘to a friend
(Mr Robert Curzon) some years ago’. 49 A further indication of their amity occurred
in 1868 when Lindsay purchased an important set of Coptic manuscripts that Henry
Tattam had elicited from the monasteries of Wâdi el Natrûn thirty years earlier. 50

He immediately sent them to Curzon, who cast his expert eye over the material and
commented:
It is very kind of you to send me those curious Coptic MSS. to look at. and I
return them, with many thanks. […] one is part of the life of St George I
should like to know what it says about our patron Saint. he is renowned in the
East for restoring mad people to their senses, I wonder whether he ever
recovered a bibliomaniac. I fear you must suffer from that malady almost as
much as your ever truly, R Curzon. 51
This initiated a sporadic but amiable correspondence, Curzon offering morsels of
literary gossip, and expressing astonishment at the splendours of the Bibliotheca
Lindesiana revealed to him by Lindsay. 52 Here one comes closest to Marvin Taylor’s
‘triangulated structure in which the book collector enjoys an intense homosocial
relationship with another male collector, one that is enabled by describing the book
as a female object’. 53 However, it would be easy to exaggerate the significance of the
epistolary communion between Lindsay and Curzon: the handful of letters they
exchanged is eclipsed by the voluminous and revealing correspondence Curzon
maintained with Walter Sneyd over five decades. 54 Furthermore, in his extant
correspondence Lindsay never employs the romantic and eroticized language in
relation to books which, according to Taylor, characterizes the homosocial
discourse of book collecting. In all of his writings I have found only a single instance
where he feminizes books, in the Library Report: ‘Books printed on vellum I have
put away from me (except in a very few instances) as seducing damsels, temptresses
like those who assailed the virtue of the anchorites in the Thebaid.’ 55 It is significant

that Lindsay raises the spectre of erotic temptation in the self-denying context of
his strict discipline as a collector: for him books are the objects of paternal affection,
not erotic desire.
Mark Girouard argues that during the nineteenth century the concept of the
gentleman as a man of taste was gradually subordinated to the public-school ethos
of sporting prowess and martial chivalry. 56 In the manly discourse of elite Victorian
society, Lindsay was vulnerable to suspicions of effeminacy and indeed latent
homosexuality, because of his secluded, scholarly habits, his dislike of society and
especially of the male-dominated metropolitan club culture, and his interest in
early Italian (and therefore Catholic) art, espoused in Sketches of the History of
Christian Art. 57 Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick articulates how the confluence of these
potentially enervating characteristics could elicit suggestions of homosexuality:
If we look at the history of distinctively homosexual roles in England, we
find that something recognizably related to one modern stereotype of male
homosexuality has existed since at least the seventeenth century – at least
for aristocrats. The cluster of associations about this role […] include
effeminacy, connoisseurship, high religion, and an interest in Catholic
Europe – all links to the Gothic. 58
Perhaps aware of the equivocality of his situation, Lindsay responded by
suppressing all instincts towards self-indulgence and indolence, and by practising
the manly virtues of ‘earnestness, selflessness and integrity’. 59 His attitude towards

manliness is revealed in his concern over the adolescent Ludovic’s ennui and selfcentredness, expressed to his brother-in-law, Robert Loyd-Lindsay:
His chief fault is one which lies deep below the surface, and almost out of
sight – a self concentration, which makes his own pleasure and satisfaction,
and not that of others, the principle of his actions. […] I see a deterioration
in his mental activity and vigour recently. His intellect was always indolent,
and tobacco is deadening it into torpor. […] I long to see him show
manliness of character in facing faults and sending them to the right
about. 60
Lindsay regarded self-denial, particularly in the field of collecting, and strict
morality as bulwarks against insinuations of effeminacy, while active manliness for
Lindsay and other nineteenth-century collectors was displaced from the battlefield
– the traditional arena of aristocratic prowess – to the auction room, as I shall
explore later in this chapter.
In summary, Lindsay identified himself with Grolier and Mahieu, paradigms of the
aristocratic tradition wherein libraries were made accessible to one’s amici. Yet he
struggled to emulate his Renaissance archetypes, because he was only loosely
implicated in the formal networks of book and manuscript collecting, and his
relationships with individual collectors were etiolated. He defied stereotypes of
Victorian bibliophiles – epitomized by Curzon and Sneyd – who participated in
intense homosocial discourse. Paradoxically his reserve threatened the social and
cultural capital that he sought to augment through the library; or rather, this capital
was diverted from normal social relations into the library, and the return on the
investment was deferred. His ambitions were realized later, in his affable son
Ludovic, who employed his considerable social and cultural capital as a trustee and
president of numerous cultural institutions, and in his grandson Bal, Cabinet
minister and influential figure in the art world.

Lindsay was doubtless aware of the negative connotations of otium amongst
classical and Renaissance writers: while it could signify the repose and leisure
requisite for scholarly and literary pursuits, more frequently it denoted indolence,
self-indulgence and (forced) retirement from the affairs of the world. 61 While he
craved seclusion, he was conscious of the responsibilities of his social position. He
thus enjoined his son to fulfil the public duties that he himself had eschewed: ‘from
this privilege there arise duties, which I trust you will recognize and carry out in
active life more fully than I – seeking out these truths, and truth in general, in the
cloisters of retreat – have been able to do.’ 62 Ludovic was indeed far more gregarious
than his father and he regarded public office as an obligation of his class gladly to
be borne. He was elected to the Roxburghe Club in 1877 (although he attended not
a single meeting), and was an assiduous trustee of the British Museum from 1885
onwards. 63 He served as president of both the Bibliographical Society and the
Library Association in 1898, and was chairman of Wigan Free Public Library for
thirty-five years. He was entirely comfortable in the company of fellow collectors,
and knew several of them socially. For example, in April 1901 Henry Yates
Thompson visited Haigh to compare a psalter and horae associated with the family
of St Louis, which he was intending to buy, with Ludovic’s Joan of Navarre Psalter.
Although Ludovic was absent, as usual, Yates Thompson asked Edmond to pass on
his ‘best regards to Lord Crawford’. 64 Ludovic also enjoyed cordial relations with
second- and third-generation collectors, or custodians of collections, such as
Thomas Fitzroy Fenwick, grandson of Sir Thomas Phillipps, who permitted him to
photograph the metal and ivory bindings in the Phillipps collection, and Alfred

The genial and clubbable Bal was, if anything, even better connected than his father
with fellow collectors, bibliophiles and scholars, especially in the metropole. He was
a trustee of the British Museum and the National Gallery, and a member of the
Burlington Fine Arts Club, Roxburghe Club (president, 1936‒40) and Society of
Antiquaries (president, 1924‒29); he was once described as ‘a most agreeable
companion, as, apart from his great fund of expert knowledge, his general outlook is
most pleasantly flavoured by his humanistic studies’. 66 As Ludovic’s day-to-day
involvement with the library diminished, his son assumed greater responsibility for
liaising with other collectors and manuscript experts. This trend was already
apparent in 1893, when Ludovic agreed to send a Samaritan manuscript to the
Oxford Orientalist, Arthur Cowley, seemingly on the strength of his friendship with
Bal, then an undergraduate at Magdalen. 67 Bal was acquainted with Charles Fairfax
Murray and Edward Burne-Jones, who introduced him to William Morris. He found
the old socialist ‘irresistibly attractive’, their shared passion for illuminated
manuscripts overcoming differences of age and politics. A flavour of their friendship
is conveyed by Bal’s diary entry for 18 August 1895: ‘I lunched at Kelmscott with
William Morris. He was in tremendous form and very reactionary. […] His library is
certainly the most charming I have ever seen. The scholarly disposition of the books
adds enormously to their beauty – and all his books have their original bindings, or
else their modern coverings are executed in good taste.’ 68 Bal also fell under the
spell of Morris’s secretary and Boswell-figure, Sydney Cockerell, who, though not

yet a collector in his own right, had already developed considerable expertise in and
enthusiasm for illuminated manuscripts. As he engaged in the melancholy duty of
disposing of Morris’s library, Cockerell offered: ‘If you would care to see any of the
manuscripts again before we part with them, I shall be pleased to show them to you
some afternoon.’ Bal even attempted – unsuccessfully – to interest the City of
Birmingham in purchasing the entire collection. 69 His grandfather would never
have countenanced friendly relations with a coal merchant’s son, still less with a
revolutionary socialist, but turn-of-the-century bibliophily was less respectful of
social hierarchies.

‘Your Lordship’s humble apprentice’: The Earls and the Booksellers

Lindsay and Ludovic not only engaged with fellow collectors and scholars; they also
treated with a large number of booksellers and other suppliers to the Bibliotheca
Lindesiana. These categories were not mutually exclusive, of course: the activities of
marchands-amateurs such as Francis Fry, the ‘maker of Chocolate and Bibles’ with
whom Lindsay had frequent dealings, elided the distinction. 70 The earls’
relationships with commercial dealers were markedly asymmetrical, with an
unequal distribution of social and economic capital between the aristocratic
collectors and their petit-bourgeois agents. However, I shall investigate how the
booksellers’ expertise and their ability to supply the earls’ desiderata established a
mutual dependency, thus problematizing any binary division of the field into
dominant and dominated fractions.

Early in his career, Lindsay patronized a large number of metropolitan booksellers:
Thomas Thorpe, Henry, John and James Bohn, Thomas and William Boone, William
Straker, Joseph Lilly, and George Willis (later Willis and Sotheran); for foreign
books he relied on Charles Molini and David Nutt (see Appendix 4). 71 Looking back
in 1865, he lamented: ‘Most of the bibliopoles I looked up to with reverence in those
early days are now no more; and my contemporaries are, like myself, grey-haired
men.’ 72 His dealings with Bernard Quaritch began in August 1852, when he ordered
nine books from a catalogue of philological works and asked to receive future
catalogues. 73 Having established his own business in 1847, Quaritch rapidly rose to
become the most successful bookseller in London and one of the greatest
antiquarian booksellers in history; he counted almost all the major collectors
amongst his clientele and dominated the sale-rooms for forty years. 74
Lindsay’s patronage of Quaritch was initially modest: in the five-year period 1852‒56
his total expenditure amounted to only £538. In 1857 his spending increased to £450,
but the breakthrough came in the following year, when Lindsay spent £1,265 with
Quaritch. Thereafter the scale of Lindsay’s custom was astonishing: between 1858
and 1880 he spent £42,026 with the bookseller, accounting for two-thirds of his total
expenditure on the library of £61,691 (see Appendix 3). In the ten-year period 1866‒
75, Lindsay’s expenditure with Quaritch was £25,249, nearly three-quarters of the
total outlay of £34,643. In the same period, annual earnings of a collier in Wigan
were around £75, while a gardener at Haigh Hall typically earned £44‒49 per

annum. 75 Although Quaritch’s own accounts for this period have not survived, it is
probable that Lindsay was his most valuable customer in the 1860s and ’70s.
Preference for a particular dealer was not unusual amongst collectors: Henry Huth
was said to have purchased books worth over £40,000 from Lilly, his ‘confidential
caterer’, although he also regularly patronized Quaritch. 76
Dealers’ agency in the development of collections is often elided in bibliographic
studies, yet leading booksellers such as Quaritch and Lilly played a significant
supporting role in shaping private libraries, problematizing notions that individual
bibliophiles were exclusively responsible for the formation of their collections. 77 In
his biographical profile of Huth, Quaritch generously acknowledged the profound
influence that Lilly had exercised over the Huth library, and the collector’s gratitude
for Lilly’s assistance. 78 Towards the end of this life, Quaritch reminded Ludovic of
his own contribution to the development of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana: ‘My share
in ^the formation of^ your Lordship’s Library has been that of a devoted servant.
Some of the choicest gems of the Library I had the honor (& the advantage) of
selling to your Lordship and to the late Lord.’ 79 While Quaritch took pride in his
achievement, his self-characterization as a devoted servant suggests that he was

rooted in an earlier aristocratic, master-servant paradigm, whereby the agent
dedicated himself entirely to the service of his patron, rather than a modern
capitalist, mercantile model in which the agent was bound into a commercial
relationship with his customer, but was otherwise an independent operator.
The partnership between Lindsay and Quaritch was cemented through the
purchase of a 42-line Bible at the sale of the Bishop of Cashel’s library in June 1858;
Quaritch secured it for Lindsay for £595 against Lilly, who was bidding on behalf of
Huth. 80 This achievement and the Libri sale of 1859, at which Lindsay spent some
£700, affirmed the places of Lindsay and Quaritch in the front rank of collectors and
dealers respectively. Quaritch acknowledged his debt to Lindsay, whose orders
‘have given me an impetus by which my general business has been extended in that
direction I most desired’. 81 They developed a close relationship built upon mutual
respect and an almost daily correspondence sustained over several decades. The
collector appreciated Quaritch’s honesty and fair dealing; his mastery of the salerooms; his detailed knowledge of Lindsay’s desiderata; his international network of
contacts, which ensured a steady supply of exceptional works beyond the capacity
of other dealers to obtain; and his willingness to go to any lengths to secure
material on behalf of his client, spending uncomfortable nights on cross-channel
steamers and continental trains to attend sales in person. For his part, the
bookseller valued Lindsay’s lucrative custom and prompt settling of accounts – an
important consideration for a dealer who operated with modest financial reserves
and relied upon credit with the auction-houses – and he respected him as a
discriminating collector and expert bibliographer. 82 For example, in 1860 he

Lindsay was proud of his financial fair-dealing, which admittedly had an element of self-

interest: ‘I have always (let me add) kept short accounts and dealt liberally with my
professional agents, and hence they have generally given me the first or an early offer when
rare articles, such as they knew or thought I must be on the look-out for, came before
them.’ LR, Introduction, p. 12. In 1873 Quaritch attributed his modest reserves to Lindsay’s

131

congratulated Lindsay on his analysis of the first two German Bibles, albeit with a
heavy dose of self-deprecation: ‘Your Lordship handles this difficult and intricate
subject of the first 2 German Bibles with the pen of a master and the ease of a
genealogist. I must candidly confess myself to be only your Lordship’s humble
apprentice. I am willing to learn and to improve myself.’ 83
The courtesies that Lindsay habitually accorded to fellow collectors were extended
to the ‘better sort’ of bookseller, such as Quaritch: he always treated them with
respect, unlike Phillipps who held dealers in contempt. When Quaritch exceeded
his commission to secure a vellum copy of the Mainz Catholicon in the Solar sale in
1860, Lindsay rewarded him with a ‘most magnificent and beautiful copy’ of
Mentelin’s edition of the work, ‘intending that he should make his profit by it’.
Quaritch instead chose to keep it in his personal library, as a ‘memorial of kindness
and good will’. Lindsay comments on this episode in the Library Report: ‘Such are
the amenities which subsist, and ought always to subsist between booksellers of the
higher or antiquarian class and their amateur clients.’ 84
Leading bibliopoles like Quaritch blurred the fine distinctions that pervaded and
defined Victorian society, demarcating classes and differentiating tradesmen and
their clients. Lindsay averred: ‘A cordiality and almost affection subsists between a
bookseller and his client such as hardly exists in any other similar relationship.’ 85
Indeed, when Quaritch learnt of Lindsay’s death, he reported to Ludovic: ‘I was
stunned, unfit for reflection, but during the night, I could only think & dream of
him, whose devoted servant I had been for 30 years.’ 86 Quaritch’s shop was
frequented by cabinet ministers, bishops, aristocrats and ambassadors, just as F. S.
steadfast patronage: ‘Your Lordship’s payments are always so very prompt that I make my
calculations accordingly. Your Lordship is such a pillar of my business, that I have hitherto
absolutely neglected to have a cash reserve at my bankers.’ Letter from Quaritch to Lindsay,

Ellis’s bookshop on New Bond Street became ‘a gathering place of the literati’. 87
Within the narrow bounds of bibliophily, Quaritch’s clientele accorded him the
respect that his expertise and market dominance warranted. 88 Likewise, in the
wider literary field he held significant cultural and social capital, as a publisher as
well as a bookseller, and his ambitions to cultivate his own networks of men of
letters and collectors met with some success. Thus in June 1882 Quaritch hosted one
of his literary dinners in honour of the explorer Richard Burton, several of whose
works he had published. He invited Ludovic, while other guests included Henry
Stanley, Baron Stanley of Alderley (a friend of both Burton and Quaritch), Henry
Yates Thompson and John Ruskin. 89 However, as Andrew St George notes,
gentlemen were increasingly distinguished from tradesmen in this period, and,
moreover, the second-hand book trade generally had a doubtful reputation: for
every leading firm there were scores of dingy bookstalls and barrows, and even
eminent booksellers such as Quaritch and Ellis invariably rose from modest
backgrounds. 90 Tainted by ‘trade’, Quaritch was condemned to remain the inferior

Carew Hazlitt, whereas his assistant Michael Kerney was a ‘gentleman’. 91 Clearly
there is a degree of false modesty here, but the correspondence between Quaritch
and Lindsay (and later Ludovic) reveals the former’s yearning for social acceptance
and respectability, a desire for recognition as a gentleman-bibliophile rather than as
a bookseller. One can sometimes detect Lindsay’s discomfiture at Quaritch’s minor
breaches of social and business etiquette, when he crossed the bounds between
bibliophilic and wider social fields. For example, in 1870 Quaritch recommended his

own sister as singing tutor to Lady Crawford’s daughters (another socially equivocal
situation), begging pardon for the ‘transgression’. 92 Lindsay may have chosen to
ignore this unorthodox proposal; certainly the Crawford Papers do not contain his
reply.
Quaritch was thus fated to supply the books which reinforced the very social
distinctions that he sought to surmount. He was always properly deferential
(employing the salutation ‘My Lord’ and peppering his letters with references to
‘your Lordship’), sometimes to the point of obsequiousness, thus conforming to the
etiquette required of a tradesman addressing a gentleman. 93 Like many in his
liminal position, who were economically dependent upon the elite and selfidentified with them rather than their middle-class peers (William Roscoe was
similarly situated in relation to Thomas Coke), Quaritch was a vigorous apologist
for the aristocracy of his adopted country. He assured Lindsay that ‘at all times I
think of your Lordship and your Lordship’s house with affection and loyalty. Should
we in my life-time (not likely) ever see in England any anti-aristocratic movements I
should put all my energy into the scales to combat the hydra of democracy.’ 94
Of course, Lindsay was not the only collector to patronize Quaritch and enjoy
cordial relations with him, and it is important to contextualize their relationship.

Crown and affection for the Aristocracy. To-night, at home, in my family circle, we shall
think of you and yours.’ Letter from Quaritch to Tyssen-Amherst, 24 December 1886;

survive. Ruskin’s letters, spanning more than twenty years, are full of
bibliographical badinage, discussions over his desiderata and purchases, and
musings on their shared admiration of manuscripts. Ruskin, like Lindsay, had a
deep respect for the bookseller, once telling him: ‘I think I know you now very
thoroughly, and shall always count on you to tell me more than anybody else could
about books, and many other matters, and to get for me, if anybody could, what of
such things I wanted.’ He even once signed a letter off ‘Ever your devoted Disciple –
and Fellow (Book)-Worm’. 95
Thus Ruskin’s letters to Quaritch are noticeably more informal and intimate than
those of Lindsay, due in part to the wider class divide which distanced the aristocrat
from the bookseller. A closer social comparator to Lindsay was William TyssenAmherst, albeit he was not Lindsay’s equal in bibliographical expertise. Quaritch
was similarly deferential in his dealings with the Norfolk landowner who was
ennobled in 1892, flattering him, appealing to his competitive instincts, coaxing him
into purchases, and submissively expressing gratitude for his patronage: ‘For your
patronage we tradesmen are bound to render you faithful services, – and that I shall
continue to do to the last day of my life.’ 96 Like Lindsay, Tyssen-Amherst regularly
treated Quaritch to hampers of game at Christmas; while doubtless sincerely
intended, such tokens of gratitude emphasized the social disparity between the
bookseller and his landed customers. Marilyn Strathern has argued that in gift
economies, ‘we might argue that those who dominate are those who determine the
connections and disconnections created by the circulation of objects.’ 97 In 1886
Quaritch even assured Tyssen-Amherst that ‘It was your early patronage, which
secured me that of the late Earl of Crawford, the late Mr. Henry Huth, the late Mr.
Astor of New York. These three bibliophiles were in past times my best patrons,

now you are the best.’ 98 While there is an element of flummery here, the volume of
their correspondence certainly intensified in the 1880s and ’90s, at a time when
Ludovic’s patronage was diminishing.
Ludovic’s relationship with Quaritch and other booksellers was more business-like,
his communications succinct, lacking the earnest bibliographical discussions that
characterized his father’s correspondence. He treated them as commercial
suppliers, rather than fellow experts. Initially he continued to depend upon
Quaritch to furnish the bulk of his purchases; the bibliopole was delighted to find in
the young earl a bold, impulsive purchaser. Gradually, however, as Ludovic gained
confidence as a collector, he relied less on Quaritch and other firms with whom his
father had enjoyed long-standing relationships, and opened up new channels of
supply. Improved international communications and banking systems made it
easier and safer to deal directly with continental booksellers, such as Joseph Baer of
Frankfurt, the supplier of two enamel bindings in 1896; Ludwig and Jacques
Rosenthal of Munich, who sold to Ludovic a thirteenth-century French Bible
Historiée; and Calvary & Co. of Berlin, from whom he purchased nine Ciceronian
manuscripts from the Braschi collection in Rome. 99 The auction of François
Vergauwen’s collection in Brussels in March 1884 illustrates his independent spirit
and growing tendency to diverge from Lindsay’s time-honoured procedures for
participating in continental sales. Whereas his father would unhesitatingly have
entrusted his commissions to Quaritch in such circumstances, Ludovic negotiated
directly with François-Jean Olivier, who had charge of the auction. Telegrams sped
back and forth between Belgium and Italy, where Ludovic was holidaying, and he
managed to secure the magnificent Dinant Gospels (Fig. 1.4), a volume of a

£437. 100
Quaritch’s confidence in Ludovic was shaken by the latter’s decision to sell the
cream of the printed collections in 1887. Accusing him of acting ‘in a state of panic’,
the bookseller offered his assistance to select £15,000-worth of run-of-the-mill
works instead, which could have been sold ‘without injury to the Library’. 101
Heedless, Ludovic ‘tore the heart out of his father’s collection’, in Barker’s phrase,
dispersing the gems of the library (many crossed the Atlantic) for comparatively
modest returns. 102 A further distancing was initiated by the appointment of J. P.
Edmond as librarian in 1891. As I discussed in the previous chapter, Edmond
assumed responsibility for all routine correspondence with booksellers, whereupon
Ludovic had few direct dealings with Quaritch and other suppliers. The librarian
(himself liminally situated within the household hierarchy) preferred to discuss
bibliographical issues with fellow professionals and academics, rather than
booksellers, whom he often treated peremptorily, thereby asserting his superiority
over ‘trade’; perhaps Edmond was distancing himself from his early career in
bookbinding.
As I shall investigate shortly, Ludovic’s and Bal’s direct engagement in the salerooms resulted in a serious breach with Quaritch in 1895, which persisted until the
bookseller’s death in 1899. Thus the profoundly significant relationship that
Quaritch had enjoyed with the Bibliotheca Lindesiana for over forty years, and upon
which his commercial success had in large measure been built, was abruptly and
unhappily severed. While the personal characteristics of the three men may have

precipitated the rift, wider societal factors were also significant. I contend that
aristocratic collectors like Ludovic and Bal sought to distinguish themselves from
their bourgeois competitors by distancing themselves from booksellers and
demonstrating that their connoisseurship, acquired through a lifetime’s familiarity
with high culture, did not depend upon the advice of tradesmen. Moreover, it was
becoming more socially acceptable for elite collectors to attend auctions in person
and to engage directly in the bidding process, rather than relying on agents. It is to
auctions that I now turn.

‘Tournaments of value’: The Earls’ Engagements in the AuctionRooms

The earls’ relationships with fellow collectors and dealers were concentrated in the
auction-room, Baudrillard’s ‘crucible of the interchange of values’. 103 This was a
theatrical arena in which rival modes of evaluating an object’s worth converged in
direct financial competition. In the following pages I investigate how the earls
engaged in the auctions-rooms, the tactics that they and their agents deployed, and
the wider social significance of auctions (which are ostensibly instruments of
plutocracy) in a period when the aristocracy’s social, economic and political
influence was dissipating. 104

Auctions broadly conform to Arjun Appadurai’s definition of ‘tournaments of value’:
Tournaments of value are complex periodic events that are removed in some
culturally well-defined way from the routines of economic life. Participation
in them is likely to be both a privilege of those in power and an instrument
of status contests between them. The currency of such tournaments is also
likely to be set apart through well understood cultural diacritics. 105
Although book auctions were routine, frequent occurrences throughout the
nineteenth century, the major sales, comprising material exclusively or
predominantly from a single collection, attracted competition from the leading
dealers and their elite clients, and they were reported in detail in the mainstream
print media. 106 Such events served as barometers of wider market conditions, and
they often set new standards for the prices of rare books and manuscripts, thus
establishing comparisons between them and other signifiers of cultural capital, such
as paintings and antiquities. They also provided a highly ritualized and
performative context within which to assess and demonstrate the relative
dominance of the various players in the field, whether as dealers or collectors. 107
Baudrillard argues that: ‘the essential function of the auction is the institution of a
community of the privileged who define themselves as such by agonistic
speculation upon a restricted corpus of signs.’ 108 While being competitive, auctions
also reinforced the ‘imagined community’ of participants; imagined because many
of the principals were represented by agents in the room. Following Baudrillard and
Appadurai, one can argue that the primary purpose of auctions, apart from their
obvious marketplace function, is in fact to hierarchize the participants.

The agonistic nature of auctions has elicited various sporting and martial
metaphors. 109 Brian Cowan has likened fine-art auctions to a duel or cock-fight,
while Dibdin famously romanticized the golden age of bibliomania with mockheroic descriptions of events such as the Roxburghe sale, as Jensen recounts: ‘it was
the modern equivalent of the jousting field, that most aristocratic of meeting places.
The market for luxurious books was a place for the public display, no longer of
greed or profligacy, but of valorous aristocratic virtues, the weapons being not
lances but money.’ 110 By the late 1850s, when Lindsay entered the lists, the era of
bibliomania was long gone, yet there remained echoes of this chivalric age both in
the language employed by Lindsay and Quaritch to describe auctions and in the
gentlemanly codes of conduct which regulated behaviour in the sale-room. 111 For
example, when Quaritch secured a vellum copy of the Mainz Catholicon at the Solar
sale in Paris, he announced triumphantly:
Another Waterloo has been fought; this time without bloodshed, & on
French ground; but I fear your Lordship will say with a heavy sacrifice. […]
Your Lordship must excuse my excentricity [sic] in comparing sales to
battles, but really if balls were flying round me in good earnest, victory could
not interest me more than a victory like the present, obtained for your
Lordship and with your Lordship’s good money. 112
Lindsay invariably practised the courtesies becoming a gentleman-collector and
regularly deferred to others in auction contests. In May 1869, for example, he not
only agreed to Quaritch’s request to abstain from competing against the Reverend
109

John Ayre for an item in a Sotheby’s sale; he proposed that Quaritch should bid up
to his own higher commission of £5 5s, and send the book to Ayre, ‘charging merely
the £2/2 or thereabouts commissioned & saying nothing about the excess. Mr Ayre
evidently appreciates & would be pleased by possessing the volume & L[or]d
L[indsa]y w[oul]d be too happy to cooperate with Mr Q. in placing it in his
possession.’ Ayre duly obtained all the lots he desired. 113
On the other hand, Quaritch and Lindsay regularly deployed their superior
economic and social capital to dominate subordinate competitors. For example,
when Quaritch secured for Lindsay the Tattam collection of Coptic manuscripts in
June 1868, he failed to obtain one particularly significant item, a liturgia, for which
another collector had left a higher commission. William Tyssen-Amherst later
became a regular and lucrative customer of Quaritch, as I have already noted, but at
this stage of his career he was not in Lindsay’s league. Quaritch therefore used his
diplomatic skills to persuade him to relinquish it in Lindsay’s favour. 114
Quaritch was famous for his domination of the salerooms, and most collectors
preferred to collaborate rather than compete with him. He could be a ferocious
opponent, once warning Phillipps, ‘I always act fair towards my customers. My
opponents I naturally cripple as much as I can at sales.’ 115 Such tactics were not
always successful, however. For example, in 1860 Quaritch attended on Lindsay’s
behalf the sale in Utrecht of the library of the Dutch Orientalist, Hendrik Christiaan
Millies (1810‒68). Finding that the industrialist William Bragge, ‘an enthusiastic
collector of rude Manuscripts’, was intent on obtaining the same South-East Asian
manuscripts, the bookseller brokered an arrangement with him and thus secured
fifty-five lots for Lindsay. 116 However, Bragge was determined to take one particular

Batak manuscript home, breached the agreement, and refused Quaritch’s request to
concede it to Lindsay. Quaritch described the incident:
Mr Bragge replied, that my request was absurd, and he could not give up one
of his Batta MSS. nor would he exchange my imperfect one for one of the
perfect ones. I told Mr Bragge*, that I asked as your Lordship’s agent, and
that I had asked from unselfish motives, as I might easily have shown cheap
courage at your Lordship’s expense.
*Knowing of the great deference paid by the English middle classes to the
English Aristocracy. 117
Unaccustomed to such determined opposition, Quaritch was affronted. He
expected his middle-class rival to be as deferential towards the aristocracy as he
was. But the bookseller had misjudged his opponent: Bragge, the self-made man,
represented a new breed of collector, more materialistic and less reverential than
the previous generation. His money was as good as Lindsay’s, and he saw no reason
to yield to a nobleman. 118

Lindsay appears never to have attended an auction in person. While aversion to
company may have been an additional deterrent in his case, elite collectors rarely
frequented the auction-rooms in the middle decades of the nineteenth century.
There were several reasons for this. First, auctions were fraught with risk for unwary
bidders, because of exiguous catalogue descriptions and such unscrupulous
practices as ‘rigging’ and the ‘knock-out’. These dangers could be reduced by
employing an experienced agent to examine the material and advise the client. 119
Quaritch or a member of his staff would invariably scrutinize lots in advance of
sales and recommend bid limits, although Lindsay would regularly adjust these
according to his own judgement; following an auction the material was carefully
collated, and any defective lots were returned. Secondly, since direct participation
in the bidding process might excite competition from rivals, prominent collectors
preferred the anonymity of bidding through proxies. 120 Finally, in the postDibdinian era auctions tended to function as wholesaling operations amongst
dealers: ‘a subdued gathering of quiet men round a dingy green baize table’ in John
Carter’s words. ‘Private collectors were not encouraged to bid in person and seldom
did so.’ 121 Whereas the showrooms of West-End booksellers attracted aristocratic
collectors, the auction-houses, where market mechanisms were fully exposed and
culturally-charged objects were reduced to raw financial transactions, were an

unsuitable locus for gentlemen. 122 Indeed, I suggest that by engaging in the auction
process vicariously, though the agency of Quaritch, Lindsay was able to adhere to
gentlemanly codes of conduct and preserve his aristocratic decorum, while
benefiting from Quaritch’s robust domination of the salerooms; like a medieval
knight or latter-day prizefighter, the bookseller fought on behalf of his aristocratic
patron who thus remained aloof from the fray.
By the end of the nineteenth century, it was becoming more socially acceptable for
gentlemen-collectors to attend book auctions in person. Authorized by the Settled
Land Acts, many aristocratic libraries came onto the market in a series of landmark
sales, which emulated fine-art auctions in their spectacle and in the media interest
that they attracted. Nevertheless, it was still unusual for gentlemen to attend an
auction and bid in person, rather than employing an agent. Bal did this on several
occasions – thus transgressing the boundary between spectator and participant or
player – most notably at the Howel Wills sale in July 1894, when he bid against
Quaritch for a fifteenth-century Augustinian nuns’ offices in a contemporary metal
binding. This earned a rebuke from the bookseller, who ‘explained loudly enough
for the small fry and the budding auctioneer to hear that I had made a great mistake
in not giving my commission to him as my noble father had always done’. Bal
rejoined that his father had asked him to attend in order to study the tricks of the
trade. 123 Quaritch’s wrath was understandable: not only was he humiliated by the
young aristocrat; this was a clash of competing financial and cultural capitals, which
threatened to compromise his near-monopolistic control of the auction-rooms.
A further breach with Quaritch occurred in February 1895 over a commission for a
ninth-century manuscript of Smaragdus in the sale of residual artworks and
manuscripts from the Libri collection. It had formerly been Quaritch’s practice,
when he held two or more rival commissions, to buy ‘as cheaply as possible for the

Smith, p. 163, argues that auctions, in fact, ‘are not exclusively or primarily exchange

processes’; rather, they (re)create social definitions of value and relations among
participants.

gentleman who has fixed the highest commission’. 124 Because of Quaritch’s market
dominance, this arrangement suited both him and his customers. For example, if
two clients entrusted him with commissions of £100 and £120 on the same lot,
Quaritch might be able to secure the item for only £50 on behalf of the higher
bidder, if there was no serious competition in the sale-room. By the 1890s, however,
institutional clients and some American collectors demanded that their
commissions be seen to be executed in full. In this case, the British Museum and
Ludovic had left commissions of £210 and £250 respectively, so when bidding
reached the low forties Quaritch’s son, Alfred Bernard, bid £211 outright to secure
the manuscript for Ludovic. Such action would have been quite unexceptionable in
the twentieth century, but Ludovic and Bal reacted with extraordinary vehemence
to what they regarded as a serious breach of trust. The former, nostalgic for a more
honourable era when gentlemen-collectors were less troubled by competition from
institutions or wealthy Americans, told Quaritch senior that he would be ‘very chary
of any commissions in future’. For his part, Bal expressed his indignation to
Edmond in extreme terms: ‘I suppose he calls it “generalship”; I call it theft. He is a
Jew, a German Jew, and a Berlin German Jew. Thermometer says 21° of frost;
internally I’m at boiling point.’ 125
These exchanges, as well as exposing pervasive anti-Semitism, are perhaps
indicative of aristocratic frustration at the commercial mechanisms of the saleroom. Auctions had always privileged financial power, although secondary factors
such as social and cultural capital were also important determinants of success, and
Walter Benjamin’s experience of being repeatedly run up by a rival demonstrates
how economic considerations can be overridden by personal rivalries and other
social factors. 126 But in a period when the market for rare books and manuscripts
was increasingly internationalized, with American plutocrats and European

financiers dominating the field, and when public institutions were also engaging
more effectively in the marketplace, it was no longer possible for British aristocrats
to exert their superior social and cultural capital over subordinate players – whether
dealers or bourgeois collectors. Auctions were sites where anyone with sufficient
money could compete, regardless of class and cultural distinction. As many
aristocratic families saw their finances undermined by the agricultural depression,
their principal engagement with the auction process was as vendors rather than
buyers. Conversely, Philippa Biltcliffe notes the popularity of auctions amongst
businessmen, who were familiar with commercial transactions and the operations
of the stock market: ‘for many of these middle-class men who lacked both a classical
education and a familiarity with art objects, the public setting of the auction offered
greater assurance than acquiring art through a private vendor.’ 127
The scenes with Quaritch signify, I propose, seismic shifts in the field of cultural
production, when the positions of dominant and dominated players were in flux.
Bourgeois collectors, lacking aristocratic self-assurance and lifelong familiarity with
culture, were often reliant upon expert dealers and fellow connoisseurs to shape
and confirm their taste. Biltcliffe argues that ‘purchasing at auction provided more
of a guarantee for a collector who was unable to ascertain authenticity for himself.
Auction culture came to stand for a particular style of acquisition, relying on public
taste rather than connoisseurship.’ 128 Haidy Geismar has shown how auction values
are determined by such mechanisms as catalogues, viewings and discussions with
dealers and fellow collectors in advance of a sale, as much as by the bidding process
itself. 129 Bourgeois collectors took advantage of these agencies, which compensated
for their own lack of expertise and connoisseurship. Ludovic and Bal responded by
asserting their independence of dealers, but ironically they were thereby obliged to
enter directly into the increasingly bourgeois arena of the auction-room, and to
adopt the manners and tactics of their bourgeois competitors. Auctions were

Conclusion

Lindsay professed to emulate Grolier and Mahieu in opening the library to his
amici. Yet he was only weakly intricated in the formal and informal networks of
bibliophilic sociability, due to his inherent shyness (later compounded by poor
eyesight), aversion to company and utilitarian principles of collecting, which
disdained the formal accoutrements and rituals of bibliophily. Consequently, the
library was little known outside bibliographical circles, and there is no evidence
that it was extensively visited or used by researchers. Lindsay’s cultural capital was
invested in the library, to be realized later by his son and grandson.
Lindsay had an ambivalent attitude towards elite dealers, such as Quaritch. His
social, cultural and economic capital was vastly superior to theirs, and as tradesmen
they were duly submissive towards their aristocratic patron. Yet within the narrow
bounds of bibliography there was a strong mutual respect, born of both their shared
expertise in rare books and manuscripts and Lindsay’s dependency upon them to
supply scarce and unique material. The antiquarian book trade in the midnineteenth century was an imperfect market where knowledgeable dealers acted as
intermediaries between supply – material widely dispersed across private
collections, auction-houses and dealers’ stockrooms – and demand from collectors
like Lindsay. Quaritch’s success depended on his unsurpassed market intelligence
and commercial networks.
Ludovic and Bal, by contrast, were much more closely integrated into the public
and private networks of elite culture towards the close of the century. This partly
reflects the increasing complexity and particularism of the literary and artistic fields
in this period, and the greater opportunities afforded for sociability and the public
display of artworks and cultural artefacts. Paradoxically, they came closer than
Lindsay to the Grolieresque paradigm of encouraging friends and associates to
engage with the library, through a generous loans policy and regular exhibitions at
Haigh and in London. Use of the library expanded, thanks to their extensive
connections within the cultural and academic worlds, Ludovic’s concerted
148

endeavours to issue catalogues of the library, and the expansion and divarication of
academic disciplines.
Ludovic and Bal adopted a more mercantilist approach to collecting, with less
emotional attachment to, and intellectual investment in, the library than Lindsay.
Their relationships with dealers were more business-like, treating them as mere
purveyors of books and manuscripts, just as they might deal with a tailor or wine
merchant. Whereas Lindsay invariably used Quaritch’s dominance of the auctionrooms to his advantage and always entrusted his bids to the ‘Napoleon of
booksellers’ (thus avoiding the dangers of personal participation), Ludovic and Bal
circumvented dealers and engaged directly in the auction-rooms. In stepping across
the divide between spectators and players, they threatened the booksellers’ cabal,
but also risked contaminating themselves with the bourgeois manners and vulgarity
of the trading floor.
There is thus a clear trajectory from Lindsay’s aristocratic paradigm (of ‘ease’,
respect for dealers born of gentlemanly manners and incontrovertible social
distinction, and detachment from the commercial arena of the auction-room) to a
capitalist model, in which Ludovic and Bal treated booksellers as commercial
suppliers, and competed directly with bourgeois collectors and American plutocrats
in the auction-rooms. This transition reflected wider societal changes, such as the
aristocracy’s weakening cultural authority, and its adoption of an unsentimental,
mercenary approach to art collections and libraries, commoditizing them in the
interests of financial (and thus social) self-preservation. 130 It also presaged Ludovic’s
eventual dismantling of the library in the face of financial adversity.

Michael Thompson goes too far in claiming that in the late Victorian age ‘aristocrats were

the philistines, impressed only by the cash value of their stock of art.’ F. M. L. Thompson,
The Rise of Respectable Society: A Social History of Victorian Britain 1830‒1900 (London:
Fontana, 1988), p. 267. Cannadine offers a more balanced view: if aristocrats were compelled
to part with their art collections, they ‘generally preferred to sell them to the highest bidder
rather than to give them away’. David Cannadine, ‘Pictures across the Pond: Perspectives
and Retrospectives’, in British Models of Art Collecting and the American Response:
Reflections across the Pond, ed. Inge Reist (Farnham: Ashgate, 2014), pp. 9–25 (p. 20).

The next two chapters focus more closely on the formation of the library, and its
Western and Oriental manuscript components in particular, in order to develop the
theses that the library was constructed to reinforce Lindsay’s social and cultural
distinction, and that it both instantiated and underpinned his interests in social,
racial and epistemological classifications. I also extend the argument of the present
chapter by demonstrating that Lindsay differentiated himself from other collectors
in the types of material that he acquired, while he and his son displayed the
generosity expected of gentlemen in welcoming fellow bibliophiles and scholars and
in loaning material out.

4 Imaginative Geography: Oriental Collections and
Classifications in the Bibliotheca Lindesiana

4.1

Introduction

In the second half of the nineteenth century the earls of Crawford assembled one of
the most significant collections of Oriental books and manuscripts in Britain. It
comprised large numbers of Middle Eastern manuscripts in Arabic, Persian, Turkish
and Samaritan; South Asian works in Sanskrit and numerous modern Indian
languages; Chinese and Japanese printed books and manuscripts; texts on palmleaf, bamboo, bone and copper from South-East Asia; papyri from Egypt in
Hieroglyphic, Hieratic, Demotic, Greek, Arabic and Coptic; as well as Syriac,
Armenian, Coptic and Ethiopic Christian codices and scrolls. While it should be
remembered that the Bibliotheca Lindesiana as a whole was predominantly a library
of European printed material, the Crawford manuscripts constituted one of the
largest and most diverse collections of Oriental works in Britain.
The earls’ engagement with Orientalism spanned three-quarters of a century, from
Lindsay’s precocious mastery of Persian while at Eton to the turn of the century
when Ludovic was acquiring papyri from Egypt and ‘exotic’ materials from SouthEast Asia, shortly before the sale of the manuscripts in 1901. This was a period that
began with ‘lonely Orientalists’, few in number, ‘undisciplined’, and with limited
access to Oriental manuscripts and museum objects, through several decades of
professionalization and complexification, to the end of the century when the
discipline was becoming highly wissenschaftlich, with specialist research institutes,
university chairs, and large state-run museums, libraries and archives. These trends,
while slower to emerge in Britain than in mainland Europe, were to a significant
extent inscribed in the development of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana. 1

This was also the time when Britain’s empire was reaching its zenith, with
thickening military, administrative, commercial and cultural networks across the
globe. 2 Said averred ‘the sheer knitted-together strength of Orientalist discourse, its
very close ties to the enabling socio-economic and political institutions, and its
redoubtable durability’. 3 In practice, the Orientalist discursive formation was far
from homogenized and cohesive; tensions and fractures ran through it, both
synchronically and diachronically, and only by eliding these discontinuities can one
synthesize a single ‘Orientalist discourse’, encompassing Charles Wilkins and
William Jones on one side and Thomas Macaulay and James Mill on the other,
empathetic late eighteenth-century Sanskritists and succeeding generations of
inflexible Anglicists, or indeed German academic Orientalism and vigorous AngloFrench colonialism. John McLeod’s plural ‘discourses’ is therefore preferable,
signifying a looser, less coherent set of structures, overlapping but not identical
interests, modes of communication, ideologies and latent assumptions, all focused
upon the East as more-or-less passive subject of the Western gaze. These discourses
encompassed artistic, literary, scholarly, exploratory, commercial, colonial and
military engagements with the East, many (but not all) of them involving racist and
stereotyping attitudes towards the peoples of the East.
As I noted in Chapter 1, I shall examine the development of the library’s Oriental
collections and the earls’ engagement with Orientalist discourses, through the lens
of recent postcolonial studies, deploying several analytical tools, including
Anderson’s ‘totalizing classificatory grid’; Foucault’s metonymic application –
refined by Anne Brunon-Ernst – of Bentham’s Panopticon to a wide range of
systems of discipline and control; Tony Ballantyne’s model of the British empire as a
web rather than a centre and periphery; and investigations of the phenomenon of

War I (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002), pp. 93–136. The phrase ‘lonely
Orientalists’ is from Marchand, p. 102.

In Chapter 2 I examined the connections between Lindsay’s interest in racial
classification and his preoccupation with the organization of libraries and
knowledge. There, too, I revealed that under Lindsay there was extensive physical
and conceptual imbrication between the Oriental collections and their Western
counterparts, whereas the former were later segregated from and subordinated to
the occidental material. The questions that this chapter addresses include: What
motivated Lindsay and Ludovic to collect Oriental materials, when most
nineteenth-century library builders confined their activities to Western
manuscripts and printed books? How did the Oriental collections support Lindsay’s
researches into racial classification, ethnology and comparative religion, and were
there any links between these interests and his concern with social and cultural
distinction? How did Lindsay and Ludovic assemble these collections, and were
there any differences between their respective practices? How did the earls of
Crawford compare with other collectors of Oriental books and manuscripts in terms
of their backgrounds, interests, motives and mechanisms of collecting? And how
did they engage with and contribute to wider Orientalist discourses in their
acquisition of material, in their endeavours to exert intellectual control over such
esoteric and intractable collections, and in opening them up to researchers?

4.2

‘Literary catholicity’: Motives for the Formation of the Oriental
Collections

Lindsay claimed not to be a collector of manuscripts per se: he told Quaritch that
he ‘[did] not profess to collect MSS’, while in the Library Report he asserted that ‘I
have never bent my thoughts’ in the direction of a manuscript library. 5 Indeed, as I
demonstrate in the next chapter, he generally eschewed the allure of illuminated
Western manuscripts. His intention was rather to create a universal, panoptical
library which would serve the present and future needs of the Lindsay family:
I have always […] proceeded on the principle that a family library should be
catholic in character – should include the best and most valuable books,
landmarks of thought and progress, in all cultivated languages, Oriental as
well as European. What one member of the family cannot, another may be
able to read and appreciate. […] On this principle of literary catholicity you
will be prepared, I think […] to recognise and acquiesce in the frequent
occurrence in this Report of books in languages – as, for example, Arabic,
Turkish, Armenian, Persian, Sanscrit, Chinese, Japanese, and others – very
foreign to our European ears. 6
Lindsay’s ambition to create a comprehensive, polyglot library was grounded in his
philosophy of holism: ‘Human Knowledge of every description is one whole, every
part bearing relation to the other parts and all to one central principle which
animates, governs and explains everything.’ 7 Analogous to Pitt-Rivers’s comparative
collection of anthropological artefacts, 8 it was also aligned with wider spectacular

Pitt-Rivers argued that the object of an anthropological collection was to ‘trace out […] the

sequence of ideas by which mankind has advanced from the condition of the lower animals
to that in which we find him at the present time, and by this means to provide really
reliable materials for a philosophy of progress’. Augustus Henry Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers, The
Evolution of Culture and Other Essays, ed. Sir John Linton Myres and Henry Balfour

and epistemological trends such as the contemporary staging of international
exhibitions, the popularity of panoramas and panopticons, 9 a revival of interest in
‘primitive’ societies, and the development of comparative anthropology. 10 As John
Burrow notes, ‘an interest in the manners, customs, institutions and beliefs of
primitive and oriental peoples ceased to be confined to travellers, antiquarians and
satirists, and to take the study of them seriously became no longer merely a proof of
eccentricity.’ 11 Lindsay thus confronted the central importance of manuscripts in
Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures: in order to document the faiths,
literatures, arts and histories of these regions, it was imperative to acquire a wide
range of indigenous writings, as well as the secondary literature generated by
Western Orientalists.
Lindsay’s interest in Oriental books and manuscripts was whetted by a visit to Egypt
in 1836‒37, when he obtained an exceptional copy of the Qur’ān, through the good
offices of Johann Rudolph Theophilus Lieder (1798‒1865). In his subsequent
narrative of the expedition, he explains:
It is forbidden to print the Koran, or even to sell it to a Christian; I have
procured, however, through the kind mediation of my friend, Mr. Lieder, a
most beautiful manuscript (once a vizier’s) of that holy volume, richly
illuminated with gold and colours in the Arabesque style of our old missals, a

Mitchell observes that ‘the panopticon […] was a colonial invention. The panoptic

principle was devised on Europe’s colonial frontier with the Ottoman Empire, and examples
of the panopticon were built for the most part not in northern Europe, but in places like
colonial India.’ Mitchell, p. 35. See also Brunon-Ernst. On panoramas, see Comment; Peter

style, indeed, imported from the East by Rome, and which, though
condemned by the classic taste of Vitruvius, Raphael thought not unworthy of
revival. 12
This statement is noteworthy both for Lindsay’s conforming of Arabic art to
Western (classical) canons of taste, and for his espousal of the widespread belief
that there was a prohibition on printing the sacred text of Islam. It situates him
firmly within prevailing Orientalist discourses which essentialized Islamic societies
as timeless and technologically inchoate. Modern commentators have adduced a
range of factors – linguistic, religious, cultural, political and technical – to explain
the late adoption of print in the Middle East and South Asia. 13 Space limitations
preclude a detailed explication of the competing theories here, but the fortuitous
implication for Lindsay was that he was collecting Oriental manuscripts at a time
when their indigenous cultural importance was diminishing; as they became
displaced by print, they were more readily obtainable than in previous eras.
Allied to Lindsay’s utilitarian ambition of creating a universal, panoptical library,
and the late adoption of printing in Middle Eastern and South Asian cultures, there

was a further reason for his collecting manuscripts from these regions: to support
his studies of comparative religion, ethnology and linguistics, which were grounded
in his profound Christian (Anglican) faith. Barker succinctly summarizes Lindsay’s
aims:
To study the ancient literature of every nation, to understand the
philological basis of their linguistic links, to know the other forms, in art and
archaeology, in which ancient civilizations have been preserved, to recognize
in all of them the grand design of God for all His peoples, underlies all his
subsequent writing and speculation, and the formation of the Bibliotheca
Lindesiana. 14
Lindsay was, in fact, situated within long-standing Orientalist endeavours to
construct a European identity distinct from and generally superior to other races.
His theories on the development of civilizations were first expounded in
Progression by Antagonism (1846), which was discussed in Chapter 2. 15 This was
published during the mid-century period when, as Nancy Stepan argues, the
theologically-based, monogenist and diffusionist tradition of race science,
popularized in Britain by James Cowles Prichard, was hardening under the
influence of colonial encounters into a more biologically-focused, polygenist and
blatantly racist approach to human racial diversity. 16
Lindsay synthesized earlier theological and philological approaches – in particular
Japhetanism and Sir William Jones’s discovery of the unity of Indo-European
languages – with a Hegelian dialectic and overt nationalism, to conclude that

humanity had achieved its zenith in contemporary Britain. 17 He argues in
Progression by Antagonism that ‘truth’ lies at the ‘point of intersection or
compromise’ between imagination and reason, which ‘meet, in national
combination and reconciliation, first and solely, however imperfectly, in the
character and constitution, Ecclesiastical and Civil, of Great Britain’. 18 Lindsay’s
classification of civilizations was based upon the post-diluvian tripartite division of
humanity deriving from the three sons of Noah. He identifies the Egyptians,
Chinese and Phoenicians – the least developed peoples – as the children of Ham,
living in an era when ‘sense’ predominated; the Assyrians, Jews and Arabs as the
sons of Shem, in which ‘spirit’ prevailed; and the superior ‘Hindu’ and ‘MedoPersian’ (Aryan or Indo-European) races as the offspring of Japhet, amongst whom
‘imagination’ and ‘reason’ respectively prevailed (Fig. 4.1). This was not a scheme of
Lindsay’s own devising but was grounded in a tradition that Colin Kidd traces back
to Isidore of Seville’s Etymologies in the seventh century, in which Europe was
associated with the stock of Japhet. 19 In early modern Europe this identification was
adopted by proponents of ethnic theology, who sought to explain the bewildering
array of cultures and religions encountered by Europeans during their global
expansion, through recourse to the Biblical account of Noachian dispersal.
To what extent were Lindsay’s views on ethnology and comparative religion
supported by, or even dependent upon, his manuscript collections? Did the former
determine or inform his collecting of Oriental materials? Certainly the bulk of the
Oriental manuscripts was acquired after the publication of Progression by
Antagonism in 1846, and so cannot have influenced its formulation. In the Library
Report, Lindsay listed some thirty Oriental manuscripts, chosen to exemplify the

extraordinary range of formats, materials, scripts and forms of decoration employed
in written texts across many civilizations, but these ‘bibliographical curiosities’ were
assigned to the extempore ‘Museum’ department (discussed in Chapter 2) and were
deemed to have little research value. On the other hand, by 1865 he had already
amassed major collections of Chinese and Japanese books, and in the following
decade he would go on to assemble large collections of Arabic, Persian, Turkish,
Hebrew, Samaritan, Coptic, Ethiopic and South Asian manuscripts. These were
certainly acquired for their research potential, rather than as mere ‘wonders’, and it
is perhaps significant that the manuscript collections embraced all three branches
of humanity, as Lindsay conceived them. He continued to develop his theories of
Japhetan superiority throughout his life, culminating in the posthumously
published Creed of Japhet, an attempt to delineate the Ur-religion of the Aryan race,
for which he drew extensively upon the philological researches of Max Müller, John
Muir and Martin Haug on the Rigveda and the Avesta, copies of which were present
in the library. 20
However, Lindsay’s limited linguistic skills (other than his early mastery of Persian)
were a practical impediment to his close study of the non-Western collections. Thus
the collections furnished Lindsay with broad impressions, not detailed, empirical
evidence. They corroborated his views on the relative progress of various
civilizations, and reinforced his liberal appreciation of their manifold contributions
to human development, but it cannot be claimed that his theories were built upon
any evidence they provided. Lindsay may have hoped one day to interrogate his
Oriental collections, but he was primarily collecting on behalf of future generations
of his family, and to benefit the wider world of scholarship.

20

Lindsay records his reliance on published editions rather than the manuscripts. Alexander

William Lindsay, The Creed of Japhet: That Is of the Race Popularly Surnamed Indo-Germanic
or Aryan, as Held before the Period of its Dispersion; Ascertained by the Aid of Comparative
Mythology and Language (London: privately printed, 1891), p. xlvii. The work was published
posthumously; his widow claimed that it was ‘looked upon by him as the great work of his
life’ (p. xiii).

162

Indeed, it would be a gross distortion to argue that Lindsay collected Oriental
materials merely, or even primarily, to corroborate his theories of racial superiority.
One of the most striking aspects of the Library Report is the space and attention
Lindsay accords to non-European cultures. He makes a series of generalized claims
for the importance of non-Western civilizations, which are remarkably enlightened
for the mid-nineteenth century:
It is not, in fact, Europe but Asia which should take bibliographical and
literary precedence in the present department of the class of History. The
great Universal Histories of the East are of higher importance than any of
the preceding, as being written in many cases by men of science,
observation, and experience, philosophers and statesmen, the Tacituses,
Macchiavellis, and Montesquieus of their time and clime. […]
I cannot and I will not apologize for these various works of history or
topography of which I have enumerated so many, whether as in our
possession or as desiderata – the sources and springs of Oriental story. […] it
will be seen that, apart from and independently of the great line of thinkers
and actors familiar to Europe, and whom we commonly consider as the
exclusive agents of the Almighty in promoting that progressive
development, a thousand tributary rills of influence have poured in from
unsuspected sources to swell and affect the main ^general^ current of
human destiny. It is as the keys to these sources – of a remoter and yet
nearer and more universal Nile – that I seek for these obscure and uncouthsounding volumes of Oriental history, which at the first sight and aspect
appear so uninteresting and uninviting. […] 21
Lindsay even exhorts his countrymen ‘not to despise either Hindoo or Chinese as a
barbarian, a “nigger,” but to recognize in him a kinsman in thought as well as in
blood, and one ^too^ of an elder stock, still deserving of reverence’. 22 For the postRebellion 1860s this was an astonishing assertion – one hears echoes of

Montesquieu, Voltaire and Sir William Jones – to which I shall return in the
following section.
In summary, Lindsay was motivated to collect Orientalia by his ambition to create a
panoptical library, embracing all the world’s major civilizations, which would
furnish data for his and others’ researches into ethnology, comparative religion,
linguistics and other disciplines. While Lindsay claimed not to collect manuscripts
per se, the central importance of the manuscript tradition in Middle Eastern and
South Asian cultures obliged him to amass such material in order adequately to
represent their achievements.
Ludovic did not share his father’s expansive interests in comparative religion,
ethnology, and the diverse cultures of the East. He may have come to the realization
that Lindsay’s dream of a universal library was neither attainable nor necessary,
given the rise of institutional libraries. Krzysztof Pomian argues that the
development of public museums (and, by implication, libraries) relieved the private
collection of its cognitive functions, liberating it to become, ‘sans réserve’, an
expression of the collector’s personality. 23 While Pomian exaggerates the public‒
private dichotomy, the Bibliotheca Lindesiana instantiates a shift towards
subjectivity and selectivity in private collections.
Thus Ludovic concentrated his collecting on particular types of material, such as
illuminated Western manuscripts and jewelled bindings, incunabula, scientific
books, proclamations and broadsides, French Revolutionary documents, philatelic
material, exotic manuscripts from South-East Asia, and Egyptian papyri. It is
difficult to perceive any coherence or philosophical structure to this bricolage, and
he moved rapidly from one field of collecting to another. Enthusiasm rather than
scholarship seems to have been his primary motivation. He was particularly drawn
to decorated manuscripts and exemplary, rather than representative, items. His
librarian reported to Bal: ‘Lord Crawford told me he did not care to increase the
number of ordinary Oriental MSS.; his desire being rather to secure any, such as the

Kufic Koran, of extraordinary interest, either for antiquity or beauty of
workmanship.’ Ludovic appears to have treated such items as bibelots – curiosities –
rather than research tools. 24 His interests in Egyptian papyri (discussed further
below) and in South-East Asian manuscripts were kindled by his own visits to those
regions, and thus these Oriental manuscripts functioned as Susan Stewart’s
‘souvenirs of the exotic’: ‘on the one hand, the object must be marked as exterior
and foreign, on the other it must be marked as arising directly out of an immediate
experience of its possessor.’ 25

‘A kinsman in thought as well as in blood’: Racial Classification and
Social Distinction

Having considered Lindsay’s primary motives for collecting Oriental books and
manuscripts – his ambition of creating a universal library containing ‘the best that
is known and thought in the world’, and his desire to support his and others’ studies
of comparative religion, ethnology and linguistics – I intend to test the proposition
that there was an intrinsic connection between, on the one hand, his interest in
racial classification and the consequent collecting of Orientalia and, on the other,
his deployment of the library in order to affirm his own social and cultural
distinction, which I shall discuss in Chapter 5. Lindsay believed that social
hierarchies within nations were inherently linked with wider racial classifications
between nations. The most successful nations were formed through the fusion of
two anterior and antagonistic peoples, characterized by Reason and Imagination
respectively, resulting ‘in a third, more powerful and enduring, of mingled blood
and language’. 26 It was the role of the aristocracy to maintain the balance of
competing characteristics in the compound nation. In the Library Report he
explains:

The subject [genealogy] is one of deep interest and of unspeakable practical
and political importance – if it be true, as I believe, and as might, I think,
easily be proved, that the progress of mankind has arisen from the successive
predominance of heroic or noble races – families originally, nations in their
growth and development – who have at successive epochs established
themselves in the fairest regions of the world, subjugated the earlier, more
numerous, and less warlike inhabitants, mingled with them in marriage, and
generated in due time in each instance a compound race, combining the
genius and merits of both stocks, and inheritors of a vigour of mind and
body which has carried them triumphantly to the several goals of their
providential mission upon earth. […] On the other hand, while such has
been the process in ascent to the culminating point of progress in the history
of all these compound races, the rulers of mankind, it is only […] so long as
the higher or more generous blood, as represented by the gentry or noblesse
of each respective country, maintains its ascendancy, not in matter of
exclusive privilege but in the spirit of political government, that national
greatness continues, – from the moment that the tide turns and that the
plebeian element begins to predominate, […] the result is inevitably, sooner
or later, the absolute government of the mob, the sovereignty of the people,
ending in anarchy, leading ^subsiding^ to military despotism. 27
In this remarkable passage Lindsay combines his racial theories, based upon the
supposed superiority of the Japhetan stock, with his belief in the benign,
paternalistic influence of the aristocracy within the British constitution. Indeed, he
implies a metonymic relationship between the ‘noblesse’ and Britain itself: both
perform hegemonic and tutelary roles, one within the nation, the other between
nations or races – the so-called Pax Britannica. His argument is of course facilitated
by the linguistic ambiguity in the metaphor of blood to signify both aristocratic
lineage and racial distinction. The importance that Lindsay attached to his
illustrious pedigree (or blood-line) has already been remarked upon, and I discuss it
further in Chapter 5. Robert Young has identified a similar conflation of the

27

LR, Historical Paralipomena, p. 1.

166

meanings of ‘blood’ in the French racial theorist Arthur de Gobineau’s Essai sur
l’inégalité des races humaines (1853‒55): ‘Gobineau adapts this aristocratic notion of
race as ancient stock to the modern notion, derived from linguistic families, of
families of races, and assumes that however large they too are distinguished by their
“breeding”, by a particular blood that flows through their veins.’ 28 The parallels with
the passage from the Library Report quoted above are obvious, although there is no
evidence that Lindsay was directly influenced by Gobineau, whose racism was of a
much darker hue, later inspiring Nazi racial ideology. 29 Whereas Gobineau used the
notion of blood to argue for the supremacy of the Aryan race, Lindsay’s primary
interest was to justify the continued hegemony of the aristocracy, while
acknowledging kinship (however unequal) between races.
Lindsay’s dual interests in racial and social classification were not unique in this
period, and they should be contextualized within wider discourses around race,
culture and the role of the aristocracy, which were particularly active in the midnineteenth century. Matthew Arnold famously couched his binary categorization of
Victorian society in racial terms borrowed from Heine, although James Caufield and
Joep Leerssen warn against presentist, essentializing readings of Hebraism and
Hellenism; these were forces, Caufield argues, ‘simply colorful embodiments of his
pale abstractions’. 30 While Arnold was certainly more critical of the dominant
influence of Hebraism in Victorian society – and thus vulnerable to charges of anti28

Semitism – he also censured Hellenism’s lack of compassion and sought to reconcile
the two forces through education of the middle classes. 31 Likewise, Mark Crinson
claims that ‘Race and nationhood were key issues for John Ruskin’, although there
was a marked shift in Ruskin’s views: his notorious invective against the Indian
Rebellion in The Two Paths (1859) contrasts with his earlier, largely favourable
opinions regarding the Arabic influences upon Venetian architecture; Crinson in
fact admits that Ruskin’s attitude to Islam in the early 1850s was ‘generally
positive’. 32
The degree of association between race and nationhood in mid-century Britain
remains contested. While Britain had its own crop of scientific racists like Robert
Knox, Peter Mandler argues that ‘the vitality of the social-evolutionary tradition
inhibited the development of biological racism and organic nationalism in
England.’ 33 While not denying the pervasiveness of anti-Semitism and other
manifestations of racial prejudice in this period, I share Mandler’s scepticism over
retrospective formulations of race and nation. National character was a complex
construct, fashioned predominantly through distinctions between Britain and other

European nations – notably France, Germany and Italy – rather than through race:
rival Europeans were ‘arguably more important in the definitions of culture and
national character than imperial possessions and peoples’. 34 Internally, national
character was of course subject to appropriation and refashioning by rival political
factions and social groups, and Lindsay participated fully in these debates.
In Lindsay’s case, there was a link between race and nationhood, but it was indirect.
‘Race’ was, in any case, a flexible concept for him: in common with traditional
practice, he used the term loosely to denote any large group with a distinct cultural
or geographical identity, such as the ‘princely races of central and northern Italy’ or
indeed the Lindsay clan. 35 Lindsay’s racism was not based upon polarities of white
and black, Aryan and non-Aryan; instead it arose from a series of triangulations: the
aristocracy stood at the apex of British society; Britain at the apex of Europe; and
Europe (or the Aryan race) at the apex of the tripartite Noachian descent. This
complex, interlocking model helps to explain how Lindsay’s interest in racial
classification (and therefore his collecting of Orientalia) and his preoccupation with
his own social and cultural distinction were mutually reinforcing. It also permits his
monogenist racial theories to be reconciled with the generosity he manifested
towards non-European cultures, as I noted earlier.
It was arguably easier for Lindsay, a member of the privileged elite, to show
magnanimity towards ‘inferior’ races, than it was for a European subaltern in the
colonial contact zone. However, Lindsay’s benevolence was not (simply) the result
of the comfortable social and geographic distance between him and the subordinate
races: the ‘telescopic philanthropy’ of Mrs Jellaby in Bleak House. 36 It was in fact

intrinsic to his elite habitus. Just as he keenly felt the heavy social responsibilities of
his class, by which he fashioned his identity as a member of the aristocracy –
upholding the highest standards of gentlemanly conduct, demonstrating
consummate taste, fulfilling his duties within extended social and familial networks
– likewise he felt obligated to be generous towards lesser races and nations. He
treated them like impecunious members of a cadet branch of the family, according
them respect as distant kinsmen, but not considering them his equals. 37

‘Spoils of many a distant land’: Mechanisms for the Development of
the Oriental Collections

Lindsay deployed a variety of strategies to develop his Oriental collections: he
purchased single manuscripts through the market mechanisms of booksellers and
auction-rooms; he bought entire collections assembled by academic and
professional Orientalists; and he employed local agents, missionaries especially, to
acquire material on his behalf ‘in the field’. I shall briefly examine each of these
methods in turn, before considering Ludovic’s collecting policy and practices.
Lindsay accumulated the printed collections and Western manuscripts largely
through the purchase of single items, whether from booksellers, at auction, or
occasionally by gift or exchange with fellow collectors. Some Oriental manuscripts
were acquired in similar fashion, from a magnificent Shahnameh bought from the
bookseller Joseph Lilly in 1855, to a manuscript of the Legends of Damar Wulan,
illustrated with two hundred images derived from the Javanese shadow-puppet
tradition, for which he paid Quaritch £40 in 1877. 38 However, these were generally
the more important items, which were accorded connoisseurial and commercial

Catherine Hall argues that white colonies were regarded as children of the mother-

country, whereas dependencies with predominantly non-white populations were treated
differently. Hall, p. 10. In Lindsay’s case, there is no evidence of such discrimination.

status similar to that of Western manuscripts; the bulk of Oriental material was
acquired by other means.
In his introduction to the hand-list of Arabic, Persian and Turkish manuscripts,
Ludovic remarked upon the contrast between his father’s purchases of entire
collections of Middle Eastern manuscripts and his normal practice of drawing up
long lists of desiderata and employing agents to seek out the works he wished to
obtain: ‘The principle here adopted was undoubtedly a good one – […] each private
collection bought entire represents, as it were, and concentrates into the moment of
such sale and purchase, a lifetime of watchful success and accumulation.’ 39 This was
a pragmatic solution to the practical difficulties of obtaining material from the East.
Moreover, since Lindsay lacked the expertise to assess the collections himself, he
relied heavily upon the reputations of the collectors from whom he purchased in
order to validate and valorize the material.
From the early 1860s onwards Lindsay purchased a series of major collections that
propelled the Bibliotheca Lindesiana into the forefront of Orientalist libraries. One
of the first collections he acquired was that of Pierre Léopold van Alstein (1792‒
1862), which was sold at Ghent in 1863. Quaritch attended the auction and
succeeded in securing the entire collection of Oriental manuscripts for 3,000 francs
(£120), colluding with the directeur de la vente to outwit the hapless librarian of the
Bibliothèque Royale in Brussels, who had received a grant to buy the collection. 40 It
is significant as the first collection of Japanese books to reach Britain, reflecting
Lindsay’s innovative tastes in book collecting, but it also contained important
Chinese works. 41 An auction of books from the collection of the French Orientalist

interest in Japanese art, arguing that ‘intellectual curiosity about Japanese art, as opposed to

Jean-Pierre Guillaume Pauthier (1801‒73), in June 1870, afforded an opportunity to
augment the Chinese department; a further sale took place in Paris after Pauthier’s
death, in December 1873, at which Lindsay secured twelve lots of Chinese books at a
cost of £118 10s. 42
Lindsay also took advantage of the opening up of China to purchase material
through agents in Beijing and Shanghai, such as Rev. Joseph Edkins and Rev.
Alexander Wylie. 43 Lindsay’s reliance on missionaries reveals the contingent and
ambivalent nature of the trade in Chinese books and manuscripts in the aftermath
of the Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion. Although the Treaty of
Tientsin of 1859 and the Peking Convention in the following year had compelled the
Chinese government to permit Western traders and missionaries to travel
unhindered throughout China, in practice movement beyond the toehold treaty
ports was still fraught with difficulty and danger. Peripatetic missionaries were
amongst the few Westerners with sufficient knowledge of the indigenous language
and culture and with suitable Chinese contacts to enable them to acquire books in
parallel with their proselytizing activities; they infiltrated Christian texts into China

and exported Chinese books to Europe. 44 Thus within a decade Lindsay succeeded
in building one of the largest and most important collections of Chinese books and
manuscripts in Britain; it comfortably exceeded the 299 titles recorded in Edkins’s
catalogue of the Bodleian Library in 1876, for example. 45
Ludovic discontinued his father’s practice of purchasing entire collections, adopting
different strategies to augment the Oriental collections. He developed a particular
interest in the literatures of South-East Asia, stimulated by a cruise to the Far East
in the winter of 1897. Although his enquiries after manuscripts in the region were
fruitless, on his return to Europe he purchased a considerable number through the
agency of Cornelis Marinus Pleyte (1863‒1917), a director of the Leiden-based
publishers E. J. Brill and the author of several works on the languages and cultures
of South-East Asia. 46 Pleyte managed to obtain manuscripts in numerous languages
– Achinese, Balinese, Batak, Buginese, Burmese, Javanese, Kawi, Madurese,
Makasarese and Malay – procuring them both via missionaries and colonial
administrators, and first-hand during his own visit to the region in 1899. Again one
observes the collector’s reliance on trusted field-workers such as missionaries and
government officials. While Lindsay had sought a few examples of South-East Asian
manuscripts to populate his universal library of world literatures, Ludovic’s motives

are harder to penetrate. As noted earlier, the exoticism of the material seems to
have held appeal, and the broad range of media on which the manuscripts were
written is noteworthy: palm leaf, bamboo, bone, bark and copper sheet. He
instructed his librarian: ‘Get all the Batak he [Pleyte] will let you have especially the
Bamboo ones.’ 47
Lindsay had been content to possess a few specimens of ancient Egyptian texts,
which he assigned to the ‘Museum’ department. Ludovic, by contrast, developed an
enthusiasm for papyri at the close of the century, which reflected growing
awareness of the historical significance of the papyrus fragments that had been
preserved in the Egyptian desert, matched by concern over their rapid destruction,
as ancient rubbish tips were mined by local farmers as a source of fertilizer
(sebākh), or sold to collectors and museums. 48 The socio-political context was also
significant in opening up Egypt to both archaeological investigation and cultural
tourism in the late nineteenth century. Following the ʿUrābist revolt, in 1882 British
forces occupied the country and reinstated the pliant Khedive Tawfīq within a de
facto British protectorate; this, together with the introduction of steamships and
railways, made it safer and easier for wealthy European tourists and archaeologists
to visit and travel around the country. 49 Egypt (or rather ancient Egypt) was
packaged and presented to the gaze of the Western tourist, who had already been
conditioned by such framing devices as the panopticon and expositions universelles,
which conflated reality and its representation, most notably in the famous ‘Rue du
Caire’ at the Paris exhibition of 1889. 50 Dominic Montserrat has also drawn
attention to the intense media interest that swirled around the startling discoveries

Arthur Hunt (1871‒1934) and Bernard Grenfell (1869‒1926), and indeed was actively
encouraged by them and by the Egypt Exploration Fund, which sponsored their
annual expeditions from the winter of 1896‒97 onwards. 51
It was in this context of heightened academic and popular interest in Egyptian
antiquities, and especially in the survival (almost uniquely in Egypt) of classical and
early Christian writings, that Ludovic embarked on an expedition to Egypt aboard
his yacht Consuelo in the winter of 1898‒99. 52 In a series of letters home he
breathlessly reported a stream of remarkable purchases. ‘I have got hold of 14
[corrected to 12] papyrus fragments & 2 on vellum Greek from the Fayum which are
curious. […] Am in negotiation for a rolled papyrus in Demotic writing, & another
already opened.’ Two days later he purchased approximately 2,300 Greek, Coptic
and Arabic fragments, on papyrus and paper, from one Sheik Faràk. From another
dealer came two Hieroglyphic and Hieratic rolls, ‘about 300 or 400 Greek papyrus
scraps gummed to paper […] a number of Greek Papyri which have been Carbonised
by fire, laid down on paper but legible’, and ‘a very fine old large Koràn’. 53
When Ludovic returned to England, he made arrangements for the collection to be
catalogued. At the suggestion of Frederic Kenyon of the British Museum, he
contacted Hunt, who responded that he and Grenfell were too busy at present with

their work for the EEF and William Tyssen-Amherst, the first major collector of
papyri in England:
Possibly however Lord Crawford may not object to some delay; and in that
case I should be very glad to do what I can for his collection. I have, I
believe, a fairly accurate idea of its contents, since I had seen all that was for
sale in Cairo and the Fayyûm before his arrival. That is one of the reasons for
the absence that you notice, of literary fragments, which had been previously
sifted out by ourselves. 54
Hunt delivers a devastating critique: the material that Ludovic had carried away
from Egypt in triumph was in fact the chaff winnowed out by Grenfell and Hunt
and scarcely merited publication, since it lacked the literary material that they had
extracted before it came to Ludovic’s notice. This is by way of preparation for an
audacious proposition: rather than chasing around Egypt for papyri himself,
Ludovic should follow Amherst’s example and commission the professional
papyrologists to do the work for him. Hunt offers his and Grenfell’s services to build
the collection: an ‘expenditure of from £50 to £100 during two or three seasons
would probably be quite sufficient, together with what Lord Crawford has already
acquired, to provide material for a really attractive and valuable publication.’ They
had the papyrological expertise and negotiating skills required to obtain at a fair
price papyri regarded as being of the first importance: literary (classical) and
Christian texts. Unsurprisingly, Ludovic accepted the proposal and told Hunt that
he and Grenfell could spend up to £250 in the coming season. Ludovic was treating
papyrus collecting as a commercial investment.

Here are laid bare the Orientalist attitudes so prevalent in papyrology in this period:
the privileging of classical and Christian fragments over ancient Egyptian material;
an almost total disregard of medieval Arabic texts; and the eliding of contemporary
(Islamic) Egypt, which intrudes only in references to unscrupulous dealers and the
wanton vandalism of the sebākh diggers. 55 Ludovic’s accounts of his activities in
Egypt, and the correspondence with Hunt, conform with David Fearn’s assertion
that Western appropriations of Greek literary papyri from Egypt were consistently
represented as ‘rightful recoveries of cultural heirlooms which instantiated British
intellectual hegemony over Egypt and its native inhabitants as imperial subjects’. 56
Egypt was treated as the ‘happy hunting-ground’ of wealthy collectors and of the
archaeologists who served them, just as the plains of sub-Saharan Africa provided
sport for big-game hunters. 57

Position-Takings: Contextualizing the Earls of Crawford in Relation
to Other Collectors of Oriental Manuscripts

The earls of Crawford were not unique or even unusual in acquiring Oriental books
and manuscripts: pervasive Orientalism ensured that many private libraries
incorporated such material during the nineteenth century, in Britain and elsewhere
in Europe. In order to assess more fully the earls’ significance as collectors and to
distinguish any atypical or unique features of their collecting – in terms of motives,

‘The papyrus-hunter of the present day sets out on his laborious task with the set purpose

of looking for papyri and for nothing else. That is not to say, of course, that other objects of
antiquity and interest will be despised, should they come in his way during his pursuit of his
main quarry, any more than one can imagine a big-game hunter refusing to bag a lion
because he is on the look-out for elephants.’ James Baikie, Egyptian Papyri and PapyrusHunting (London: Religious Tract Society, 1925), p. 226; quoted in Fearn, p. 179.

methods, scale and focus – they must be contextualized in relation to other
collectors. 58
Most collectors of Oriental manuscripts in the late eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries fall into three broad categories. The first comprised ‘field’ Orientalists –
officers of the East India Company (EIC), its European rivals and their respective
armies, and those who followed in their wake, such as missionaries and traders –
who acquired manuscripts in the colonial ‘contact zone’, as war booty, or through
the more-or-less legitimate acquisition of indigenous libraries and single
manuscripts; these men were in Bayly’s ‘vanguard of the imperial information
collectors’. 59 Secondly, there was an expanding cohort of metropolitan Orientalists
– independent scholars and, increasingly, those holding positions within the
academy – who acquired manuscripts to support their research. The third group
consisted of elite collectors who obtained specimen manuscripts to exemplify the
highest standards of Eastern art and calligraphy, and to stand as comparators with
their illuminated manuscripts from medieval and Renaissance Europe.
Of course, there were notable exceptions to this tripartite classification: William
Beckford (1760‒1844) and William Bragge, for example, defy easy categorization.
Beckford, ‘lone wolf among collectors’, embodies the syncretism of medievalism and
Orientalism, those mutually reinforcing ‘othernesses’, which flourished during the
era of Romanticism. 60 Ganim has explored this linkage, pointing out that
geographic and temporal alterities are to some extent interchangeable: the past is
another country. 61 Thus as well as medieval, Renaissance and modern European

Collecting of Oriental manuscripts in the nineteenth century is under-researched, limited

to profiles of individual collectors and studies of the provenance of institutional holdings.

impressive library of printed books and European manuscripts, Beckford assembled
a significant collection of Oriental manuscripts, while Lucian Harris claims that his
albums of Indian miniatures probably constituted the largest private collection of
such material in Britain in the early nineteenth century. 62
‘Company Orientalists’ were responsible for acquiring tens of thousands of
manuscripts during Britain’s long history of engagement in South Asia. Notable
collectors included: Colin Mackenzie (1753‒1821), Surveyor-General of Mysore and
later Madras; 63 the Swiss scholar-mercenary Antoine Polier (1741‒95), a prolific
collector of manuscripts who adopted a ‘double persona’ as gentleman-Orientalist
and Mughal nobleman; 64 Charles Wilkins (d. 1836), translator of the Bhagavadgītā; 65

Such collections exemplify the hybridity of the EIC itself, which was a curious
amalgam of private enterprise and imperialist agency of the British Government in
the East. The collections both mirrored the individualized experiences, tastes and
interests of the officers who assembled them – exhibiting the qualities of souvenirs
or trophies – and simultaneously manifested and were authorized by the policies
and practices of the EIC and of the British Government, in seeking to outmanoeuvre
their European rivals and subjugate indigenes in the name of trade and empire. 70

collecting on the national scale, as Elsner and Cardinal have explicated. 71 Many

ended up in the possession of the EIC and other institutions, underscoring their
equivocal public-private status; the presence of indigenous manuscripts within
institutional collections at the heart of empire continually reaffirmed – indeed reenacted – British conquests (military, political and cultural). Manuscripts thus
functioned as instruments of colonial intelligence gathering and control; they
constituted an additional component of Anderson’s ‘totalizing classificatory grid’,
alongside the census, the map and the museum, which ‘illuminate the late colonial
state’s style of thinking about its domain’. 72
One of Said’s tenets is the implication of academic interest in the East with
colonialism, or muscular Orientalism. Certainly it is impossible to draw clear
distinctions between ‘Company’ Orientalists and their counterparts in the academy,
in terms of the personnel involved, their networks, their competences, or their
motives for engaging with the East. At the beginning of the nineteenth century,
many experts in Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian languages and literatures were
Company men, whose duties demanded at least some linguistic abilities in order to
communicate with the people over whom they ruled. One such was Turner Macan
(1792‒1836), chief Persian interpreter to the Commander-in-Chief of India, who
assembled an important collection of books and manuscripts, including a copy of
the Shahnameh said to have belonged to the Kings of Oudh, which formed the basis
for Macan’s published edition, and was purchased by Lindsay in 1854. 73 Even
Orientalists firmly situated within British universities engaged with colonialism,
such as Edward Granville Browne (1862‒1926), Professor of Arabic at Cambridge,
who trained officers of the Egyptian and Sudanese civil service and the diplomatic

Conquests and Imperial Self-Fashioning’, Past & Present, 184 (2004), 109‒35 (pp. 113–14).

During the nineteenth century there arose a cohort of collectors like Lindsay, whose
interest in Oriental manuscripts was neither inspired by first-hand experiences of
the East, nor motivated by the imperatives of their official positions as functionaries
of the EIC or the British Government. In 1866 Lindsay purchased the manuscripts of
two stay-at-home Orientalists, Nathaniel Bland (1803‒65) and Duncan Forbes
(1798‒1868). Bland was a gentleman-scholar of Persian literature, who served on the
council of the Royal Asiatic Society and published several articles in the Society’s
Journal. 75 Bland appears to have begun collecting manuscripts in the 1820s, buying
extensively from the booksellers John Cochrane, Howell & Stewart, and William
Straker, who all specialized in Oriental books and manuscripts. He also made
substantial purchases at the sales of the earl of Guilford (1835), Turner Macan
(1838), Rebekah Bliss (1842), and Silvestre de Sacy (1842). 76 By 1838 his expenditure
on manuscripts had amounted to over £600. 77 Quaritch described him as ‘a first

class Arabic and Persian scholar, who bought MSS. 20 and 30 years ago almost at
any price, he was then very rich.’ Unfortunately Bland lost his entire fortune to
gambling and shot himself at Bad Homburg in August 1865. The following June
Quaritch sold his manuscript collection to Lindsay in two instalments of £450 and
£400. 78
Bland’s friend Duncan Forbes epitomizes the gradual academicization of
Orientalism in England during the nineteenth century. After a residency at the
Calcutta Academy in 1823‒26, curtailed by ill health, he spent the remainder of his
career in London; from 1837 he held the chair of Oriental languages at King’s
College, despite a lacklustre scholarly reputation. Lindsay purchased fifty-six Forbes
manuscripts from William H. Allen & Co., publishers to the India Office, paying a
total of £362 2s. 79 Quaritch remarked: ‘In former years Dr. Forbes used to scoure
[sic] the London market, but he would rarely buy anything but low priced
articles.’ 80 This was a scholar’s working library, enlivened by a few choice literary
texts.
From ‘field’ and scholarly Orientalists, I turn to the third group of collectors. It was
not unusual for elite manuscript collectors and bibliophiles to possess a handful of
exemplary Oriental items, alongside their Western illuminated codices and printed
books, which provided a veneer of Oriental exoticism. They especially favoured
richly decorated Persian and Sanskrit manuscripts and calligraphic Qur’āns, which
were selected according to similar aesthetic criteria as illuminated Western codices,
reinforcing the perennial association of the East with luxuriance and excess. Like
exotic flowers uprooted by plant-hunters and classified along ‘scientific’ principles,
the manuscripts’ specific cultural and religious contexts were elided in a process of

assimilation into European artistic and literary canons, while they simultaneously
retained a generalized ‘otherness’, and were often appended to, rather than fully
integrated with, collections. Bhabha’s famous conceit, ‘Almost the same, but not
white’, originally applied to colonial mimicry, is equally pertinent to the
ambivalence of Oriental manuscripts when transposed to the connoisseurial
context of elite libraries. 81 Thus Henry Huth owned fine copies of the Bhagavadgītā
and Shahnameh, an Ethiopic Prayerbook, and an Armenian Evangelia. 82 Frank
McClean’s collection of two hundred manuscripts, bequeathed to the Fitzwilliam
Museum, included ten Arabic and Persian manuscripts and single examples of
Ethiopic, Armenian and Pali. 83 Similarly, the seventy-one manuscripts recorded in
the catalogue of William Tyssen-Amherst’s library were overwhelmingly European;
the nine Oriental manuscripts – a complete Qur’ān and portions of three others,
two Persian codices including a collection of Ferdowsi’s poetry, and three Arabic
manuscripts – were relegated to the final section of the catalogue. 84 At the apex of
collecting, the cabinet of Baron Edmond de Rothschild (1845‒1934) epitomized the
taste for superlative examples of the art of illumination within the Judaeo-Christian
traditions; the few Oriental manuscripts he possessed, including the incomparable
Shah Tahmasp or ‘Houghton’ Shahnameh, half of the famous Akbar-Nameh, and
three albums of Indian and Persian miniatures, conformed to the dominant
aesthetic of Western connoisseurship. 85
An interesting comparator to Lindsay and Ludovic, one who stands apart from the
previously discussed categories of collector, was the Sheffield industrialist William
Bragge. While susceptible to the allure of illuminated medieval manuscripts, Bragge
also acquired a wide range of material from across the world, with some thirty
languages represented in his collection. In addition to manuscripts in Arabic,

Persian and the other principal languages of the Middle East and South Asia, Bragge
owned material on palm-leaf and bamboo from South-East Asia; Mexican, Ethiopic
and Tibetan manuscripts; and volumes of Chinese and Japanese drawings. The
collection thus reflected Bragge’s own cosmopolitan life, the growth of industrial
and commercial networks across continents, and the globalization of the
manuscript market in this period. When the manuscripts were sold in 1876, onequarter of the five hundred or so lots comprised Oriental material. 86
The Bragge collection closely parallels the manuscript portion of the Bibliotheca
Lindesiana in the broad range of cultures, languages and writing formats
represented, albeit on a much smaller scale. Like Lindsay, Bragge was a major
patron of Quaritch, who discerned similarities between his two customers, as he
explained to Lindsay in 1864: ‘I thought to find in a man of such a calling, a most
refined taste and most enthusiastic feeling for what ever is curious and beautiful in
Manuscript Literature, was a curious fact, worth mentioning to your Lordship,
especially as Mr Bragge’s principle of collecting MSS. is the same as your
Lordship’s.’ 87 However, the correspondences should not be overplayed. Bragge’s
motives for collecting Oriental manuscripts are difficult to penetrate, but he may be
characterized as a serial collector: alongside manuscripts he collected editions of
Cervantes, pipes and smoking paraphernalia, books on tobacco, and precious gems.
He appears to have collected Oriental manuscripts as curiosities, in the
Wunderkammer tradition, or as personal souvenirs, more akin to Ludovic’s interest
in exotic material purely for its eclecticism, in contrast to Lindsay’s more rigorous
intellectual approach. There is also no evidence that Bragge’s manuscripts were
catalogued before their sale in 1876, and they were rarely consulted by scholars. 88
Thus the earls of Crawford were quite unlike other nineteenth-century collectors of
Oriental manuscripts, both in the scale of their acquisitions, and in the broad

geographic and cultural horizons of their collecting. They differentiated themselves
from elite or ‘cabinet’ collectors by not restricting their Orientalia to a small
number of superlative specimens. Neither did they confine their collecting to
material from a particular region or culture, whereas most academic and ‘Company’
Orientalists tended to acquire manuscripts from the countries where they were
stationed or where their academic interests lay. And notwithstanding the analogies
between Bragge and the earls of Crawford – in terms of the mechanisms by which
they assembled their collections and the range of material represented in them –
they were separated not merely by social class but also by the scale and (at least in
Lindsay’s case) the intellectual underpinnings of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana. The
earls of Crawford were indeed exceptional in the scope and ambition of their
collecting of Oriental manuscripts.

4.6

Border Crossings: The Earls of Crawford and their Engagement with
Orientalist Discourses

Some of the ways in which the earls of Crawford engaged with Orientalist
discourses have already been discussed: the mechanisms by which they acquired
manuscripts, their interactions with scholars and experts in the ongoing project to
impose intellectual control over the collections, and their endeavours to make the
Oriental material available to researchers. It is now appropriate to explore these
modes of engagement in greater detail, before I consider whether and to what
extent the Oriental collections of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana themselves
contributed to and advanced wider Orientalist discourses.
Many British collections of Oriental manuscripts were directly implicated in
militant imperialism, as I have already observed. For example, after the fall of
Seringapatam several thousand volumes were transferred from Tipu Sultan’s library
to Fort William College, where they were catalogued by Charles Stewart; some were
later transferred to England and ultimately resided in the British Museum and the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, thus corroborating the mutually reinforcing
associations between academic Orientalism and active imperialism. 89 In the preface
to his catalogue Stewart recorded that very few of the books had been purchased by

Tipu Sultan or his father: instead they had been plundered from the libraries of
other Indian states. 90 No doubt this helped assuage British consciences, but it also
warns against simplistic, reductive readings of manuscript collecting as the
unequivocal manifestation of a brutal imperialism imposed upon innocent
indigenes. Rather, one should acknowledge the nuanced, contingent positions of
both rulers and ruled within imperialism. It must also be remembered that
spoliation was a characteristic of European wars too: colonial forces simply exported
practices honed on native soil. 91
Although Lindsay was not directly engaged in imperialism (unlike his grandfather,
Alexander Lindsay, who as governor of Jamaica in the 1790s had viciously
suppressed a Maroon rebellion, or his great uncle Robert, who grew rich from
private trading ventures while serving with the EIC), his collecting practices
certainly benefited indirectly from aggressive colonialism. In the Library Report he
openly declares that he sought to form the Bibliotheca Lindesiana by ‘bringing the
spoils of many a distant land, through the compulsion of peace, towards its
subsequent edification’. 92 While the oxymoronic ‘compulsion of peace’ encapsulates
the contradictions at the heart of imperialism, Lindsay states explicitly that the
development of the library was predicated upon the simultaneous expansion of
Britain’s empire, and it is certainly the case that a large number of his manuscripts
derived, albeit indirectly, from military exploits around the world. In 1862, for
example, Quaritch informed Lindsay that he had recently acquired an exceptional
copy of the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred book of Sikhism, said to have been
‘wrested out of the hands of a Sikh Priest at the battle of Guzerat by an Officer of

the 52nd Bengal Native Infantry’. Overlooking such doubtful provenance, Lindsay
told Quaritch that he would ‘be glad to keep the Sikh MS, which is of great curiosity
& value’. 93
In 1868 Lindsay acquired two collections of manuscripts that were closely associated
with recent colonial campaigns. In July he paid £400 for 717 Arabic, Persian and
Turkish manuscripts and sixty-four printed books offered by the executors of
Colonel George William Hamilton (1807‒68), who had served with the EIC as a
regimental interpreter in central and northern India. Hamilton exemplified the
Company soldier-scholar: he ‘always paid great attention to the native languages,
not merely the vernaculars, but also to the Arabic and Persian, and gradually
collected a good oriental library’, while during the 1857 Rebellion, ‘he marvellously
held his ground and kept the soldiery from breaking out into violence.’ 94 Both
Quaritch and Charles Rieu of the British Museum advised that Hamilton’s
manuscripts had been looted, the former claiming that ‘although the MSS. as a
general rule are not of any antiquity, they were for the most part transcribed for the
Kings & Nabobs of Oude, being in fact plunder from the libraries of Lucknow –
which is some warrant for their correctness.’ Quaritch thus inverted the customary
ethics of connoisseurship, arguing that their illicit provenance, far from detracting
from their desirability, actually substantiated their significance. 95

While Lindsay was negotiating the purchase of the Hamilton manuscripts – fruits of
imperialism in India – Quaritch was securing for him a collection of Ethiopic
manuscripts, booty from the Anglo-Indian expedition to Abyssinia. Less than three
months after the sacking of Magdala, Quaritch informed Lindsay that he had just
bought a ‘very curious’ collection of seven Ethiopic manuscripts from the infamous
Magdala hoard, of which some 350 manuscripts were presented to the British
Museum:
Though it was stated that all the Manuscripts looted at Magdala had been
given up to Mr [Richard] Holmes for the British Museum, it appears that Mr
[Hormuzd] Rassam contrived to have some private loot or private purchase at
one of the Churches at Magdala, which acquisition, he not being a soldier, was
not surrendered. Captain [Howard] Coghlan […] bought these MSS. from Mr
Rassam at Magdala and brought them to London. Captain Coghlan landed
only yesterday, to-day they were offered to me for £150, but I bought them at a
price to be able to sell them to your Lordship at £100. 96
Both Quaritch and Lindsay admitted some scruples over the circumstances of the
manuscripts’ removal from Magdala, the latter commenting: ‘Lord L. cannot but
lament, with Mr Quaritch, that the fate of war should thus deprive the poor people
of what is not only their scanty literature but the material means of carrying on
their religious worship. Still Magdala and its neighbourhood is but a fragment so to
speak of Abyssinia.’ 97 This accepting attitude accords with Lindsay’s views on the
comparative development of different races and civilizations, as expressed in
Progression by Antagonism, and with prevailing notions of Western supremacy,
which were propagated through scientific, racial and imperialist discourses and by
Christian doctrine. 98

In both cases, the Hamilton library and the Ethiopic manuscripts, it is significant
that the British Museum had already obtained material from the same sources. The
Museum’s official acquisition procedures not only validated the importance of the
manuscripts, but also legitimated them and absolved the doubtful circumstances
through which they were obtained, thereby justifying and sublimating the
collector’s private purchases.
The implication of manuscripts in colonial conflicts persisted throughout the
nineteenth century and beyond. In May 1898 Edmond reported that he had received
on approval two Javanese manuscripts taken from the Rajah’s palace at the capture
of Cakranegara, during the Dutch military intervention in Lombok four years
earlier. 99 Ludovic expressed no compunction in accepting them. However, not all
Javanese manuscripts were procured forcibly: many local owners were happy to sell
their manuscripts to Western collectors and their agents, while Behrend notes that
in the early twentieth century manuscripts were produced specifically to satisfy the
demand from Dutch scholars. 100
Examples such as this of indigenous ‘talking back’ are reminders that local agency
was a significant – if largely occluded – factor in the formation of the library. Only
rarely did the earls deal directly with indigenes, such as when Ludovic purchased
papyri from dealers in Cairo. 101 Nevertheless, many of their suppliers (fellow

Likewise, Alison Petch notes that Pitt-Rivers and A. W. Franks collected ethnographic

objects second-hand, rather than directly from indigenous sources. Alison Petch,
‘Assembling and Arranging: The Pitt Rivers’ Collections, 1850‒2001’, in Collectors:
Individuals and Institutions, ed. Anthony Shelton (London: Horniman Museum and

190

collectors, booksellers and agents ‘in the field’) did treat with local informants,
owners and vendors who, except in the extreme case of plunder, were to varying
degrees able to influence the quality, quantity and prices of manuscripts that came
onto the market. Collectors such as Ludovic complained both that the best material
was withheld from them and that they were obliged to pay excessive amounts for
second-rate manuscripts. Thus subaltern voices insinuated themselves into elite
collections such as the Bibliotheca Lindesiana. 102
Even when the earls of Crawford were not directly implicated in aggressive
imperialism, they benefited from the traffic of Oriental manuscripts that developed
in the wake of colonial adventures. Ballantyne’s model of the British empire as a
web is a more faithful representation of the shifting interdependences of
colonialism than the traditional centre-and-periphery model, but there is no doubt
that London was the focus of international trade in manuscripts, which were a
commodity of empire alongside staples such as tea, sugar and cotton. 103 Quaritch
functioned as an entrepôt for books and manuscripts arriving in Britain from all
over the world, although other booksellers also dealt in Orientalia, such as Charles
John Stewart, from whom Lindsay purchased a collection of twenty-two Samaritan
manuscripts for £450 in July 1872. 104 Lindsay also acquired a large number of
manuscripts on the Continent, where there was a longer tradition of collecting and
studying such material, thanks to three hundred years of Dutch engagement in the
East Indies and the concomitant expertise accumulated at the University of Leiden,
whose pre-eminence in Orientalist studies was eventually supplanted by Paris
during the first half of the nineteenth century. 105 Thus the van Alstein, Pauthier and

Millies sales all furnished Lindsay with significant numbers of important
manuscripts.
The earls of Crawford engaged with Orientalist discourses in other contexts. They
collaborated with scholars and experts in their endeavours to impose intellectual
control over the collections, and to make them more accessible to researchers and
more widely known. The slow development of Orientalist disciplines within British
universities, in comparison with their continental counterparts, is apparent in the
continual difficulties that Quaritch and the earls experienced in finding suitable
experts in Britain to catalogue the collections; instead they regularly turned to
European scholars for assistance. 106 Thus in 1870 Quaritch confessed that he knew
of no-one who could catalogue Siamese manuscripts, while twenty-two years later
Reinhold Rost of the India Office Library lamented that Edward Cowell in
Cambridge was the only person in Britain competent to catalogue Zend and
Sanskrit manuscripts. ‘But I doubt whether he would undertake this matter. In that
event I would recommend Professor Geldner, of Berlin.’ 107
The scholars and experts who were employed to catalogue the Oriental collections
were an eclectic group. They included Sukias Baronian, Armenian minister in
Manchester (Armenian); Sir Ernest Wallis Budge of the British Museum (Coptic);
Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare of Oxford (Armenian); (Sir) Arthur Cowley of
Oxford (Samaritan); Prof. Karl Friedrich Geldner of Berlin (Parsi); Abraham Löwy,
minister at the West London Synagogue (Samaritan and Hebrew); Prof. George
Karel Niemann of Delft (Batak); Léon Pagès of Paris (Japanese); Rev. John Medows
Rodwell (Coptic); Dr Reinhold Rost of the India Office Library and St Augustine’s

West, independent scholar (Parsi); and John Williams, Assistant Secretary of the
Royal Astronomical Society (Chinese). The development of the papyrological
collections brought other scholars within the ambit of the library: Walter Ewing
Crum, Francis Llewellyn Griffith, Bernard Grenfell, Arthur Hunt, and Prof. Josef
Karabaček in Vienna. In addition, Quaritch’s ‘mercurial, multilingual, and
polymath’ assistant, Michael Kerney, catalogued the Arabic, Persian and Turkish
manuscripts; he was an accomplished, self-taught linguist, who did much of the
work in his spare time. 108
The diversity of these experts – some situated within the academy, others located
within the cognate fields of museums and libraries, and yet others independent
researchers and those whose cultural and linguistic backgrounds were their
principal qualification – demonstrates the contingent, transitional status of
Orientalism in the second half of the nineteenth century: the exterior boundaries
and internal structures of the discipline were as yet poorly defined; there remained
significant intersections with theological and classical studies; and distinctions
between amateur and professional were faintly drawn.
There was a strong element of self-interest in these experts’ engagement with the
library: they were eager to study and describe the largely unexplored Crawford
manuscripts because of the opportunities they afforded to make significant
discoveries. The earls of Crawford were indeed munificent in permitting scholarly
access to the collections, not only at Haigh Hall, but also by lending material out for
sustained periods of study. For example, in September 1887 John Gwynn of Trinity
College Dublin enquired through an intermediary if he might borrow Syriac MS 2, a
New Testament, which was already on loan to Rev. George H. Gwilliam in Oxford.
Permission was duly granted. When Edmond enquired in December 1892 whether
Gwynn had finished with the manuscript, the latter explained that he had returned
it to Gwilliam over a year earlier. Gwynn also provided a full report on the volume,
claiming that it was ‘the only complete Syriac MS. New Testament ever brought

from the East into a European Library’. After further prompting, Gwilliam
eventually returned the manuscript in September 1893. 109
The degree of academic engagement with the Bibliotheca Lindesiana is
demonstrated by the adverse reaction to the sale of the manuscripts to Enriqueta
Rylands in 1901. Far from welcoming their ultimate deposition in a public
institution, scholars protested that their ready access to material had been abruptly
curtailed. Browne was greatly inconvenienced by the recall of Persian MS 308,
which he had been studying since 1898 for his edition of the Lubábu ’l-Albab. He
told Edmond: ‘Lord Crawford has been so generous and yourself so kind in letting
me have the MS. for so long that it would be most ungracious of me to complain of
its recall, though I will admit that it is a disappointment, as I had been making it
the pièce de résistance of my work.’ 110 Not content with private expressions of regret,
Browne publicly criticized Enriqueta’s policy of limiting access: ‘I must still regard
the passing of these MSS. out of the hands of their former most generous owner as
one of the greatest calamities which have befallen Oriental students in recent
times.’ 111 The theme was taken up by Reynold Alleyne Nicholson in his published
review of Browne’s edition: ‘These MSS., we are glad to learn, have recently been
made accessible, but until the wise and liberal policy of Lord Crawford is adopted,
their transfer to the place mentioned must be regarded by Oriental students as a
great calamity.’ 112 Such sentiments complicate any supposed public-private
dichotomy of nineteenth-century libraries: a private library such as the Bibliotheca

Lindesiana could be more accessible, at least to eminent scholars and gentlemen,
than a rule-bound ‘public’ library such as Enriqueta Rylands’s foundation.
These forms of engagement with academic Orientalists were obviously
circumscribed and specific, and there is no evidence that the earls of Crawford
considered themselves members of an Orientalist community, however loosely
defined. 113 Neither Lindsay nor Ludovic engaged with the formal structures of
Orientalism, which organized, disseminated and legitimated Orientalist discourses:
they were members of neither the Royal Asiatic Society nor the Royal Geographical
Society, for example. They were peripheral figures in the development of academic
Orientalism in Britain. While they were generous in loaning material to scholars,
the physical isolation of the collections in Wigan, remote from the principal loci of
scholarship, and the lack of detailed catalogues inhibited their exploitation for
research. When Bal complained in 1898 that the library’s Oriental department was
little used, Edmond pointed out that he was sending a copy of the newly-published
Hand-List of Oriental Manuscripts to Edward Browne in Cambridge, adding: ‘As the
library gets better known the Oriental books will be more asked for.’ 114 However,
this unsatisfactory situation persisted long after the transfer of the collections to
Enriqueta Rylands; throughout the twentieth century they continue to be
underutilized in comparison with analogous collections in the established centres
of academic Orientalism in Britain and mainland Europe.

Conclusion

Lindsay was motivated to collect Oriental books and manuscripts by his desire to
fashion a panoptical library, encompassing all major civilizations of the postNoachian diaspora, in order to facilitate his and others’ researches into ethnology,
comparative religion, linguistics and numerous other fields. His attitudes towards
issues of race, imperialism and the East are complex and ambivalent, mirroring
wider trends and debates in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. He was

prepared to deploy teleological arguments in support of British imperialism and
overlooked acts of colonial violence by which manuscripts were wrested from their
indigenous contexts. On the other hand, his possession of Oriental materials
evidenced – and may have encouraged – an unusually enlightened attitude towards
non-European cultures and their achievements, akin to Sir William Jones’s earlier
quest for a sympathetic understanding of Indian civilizations. Lindsay’s racial
theories synthesized earlier monogenist and philological – broadly liberal –
approaches with a Hegelian dialectic and blatant nationalism, to argue for the
superiority of the Aryan races, which he believed had reached their apogee in
Victorian Britain. Yet he did so with that ‘delicate manner […] wherewith anything
can be said or done by a gentleman’. 115 Unlike contemporary scientific racists, he
acknowledged kinship, however distant, with ‘inferior’ races.
Indeed, Lindsay’s interest in racial classification connected to his concern with
social distinction and class, and in particular his advocacy for the continued
relevance of the aristocracy; he believed that social distinctions within nations were
intrinsically connected to wider racial classifications, while his aristocratic
upbringing and sense of social obligation inculcated paternalistic benevolence
towards other races. These overlapping concerns reflect wider associations between
imperialism and the self-fashioning of Britain’s social elite (a theme I explore in the
following chapter), as Mark Girouard argues: ‘[t]he sources of imperialism and the
sources of the Victorian code of the gentleman are so intertwined that it is not
surprising to find this code affecting the way in which the Empire was run. […] The
philosophy of imperialism was essentially élitist.’ 116
Ludovic developed the Oriental collections in new areas, although his motivations
are more opaque, partly because his enthusiasms for papyri and South-East Asian
manuscripts were short-lived, but also because he effectively withdrew from direct
engagement with the library after the appointment of a professional librarian, as I
discussed in Chapter 2. He seems to have treated manuscripts as ‘souvenirs of the
exotic’, rather than as research resources. In any case, by the turn of the century
115

Orientalist disciplines were coalescing within universities, learned societies and
museums, a process that would increasingly marginalize amateur Orientalist
scholars and collectors, notwithstanding the complaints provoked by the sale of the
manuscripts to Enriqueta Rylands.
While Said’s thesis has informed my discussion of the earls’ engagements with
Orientalism, subsequent postcolonial studies have uncovered a more complex,
contingent position: a matrix of loosely related Orientalist discourses, intersecting
with the cognate disciplines of theology and classics, and enjoying a far from
straightforward relationship with muscular imperialism. This more nuanced
approach permits a fuller appreciation of the complex and sometimes contradictory
relationships between the earls of Crawford and wider Orientalist discourses. They
engaged with Orientalism in various ways: through their acquisition of books and
manuscripts, some of which were implicated in aggressive imperialism, while others
had been accumulated by academic Orientalists in Britain and Europe; via their
employment of experts to catalogue the material; and by opening the collections to
academic investigation. Lindsay made modest contributions to Orientalism through
his published writings, and he pioneered certain fields of collecting in Britain, such
as Japanese books and manuscripts. However, neither he nor his son were intricated
in the official structures of Orientalism, which became increasingly formalized and
ramified towards the end of the century.
My intention in this chapter has been to investigate the distinctive features of the
Oriental collections, the factors, both structural and specific, which impelled their
development, and the diverse ways in which they folded into wider issues of race,
imperialism and organizations of knowledge. While the Oriental manuscripts
dominated their occidental counterparts numerically, the latter performed a crucial
function within the library, for which Orientalia were unsuited. I argue in the next
chapter that the Western manuscripts helped to reinforce Lindsay’s cultural capital
and to consolidate his family’s and the aristocracy’s hegemony within British
society. They thus ‘speak to’ a related set of issues around social and cultural
distinction and the aristocracy’s fitness to lead a modern global empire.

5 Modern Medici: Constructions of Class and Distinction in
the Bibliotheca Lindesiana

5.1

Introduction

In this chapter I shall contend that Lindsay deployed the Bibliotheca Lindesiana,
and his medieval and Renaissance manuscripts in particular, both to fashion his
own social and cultural identity as a gentleman of refined taste, discrimination and
erudition, and to serve as a bulwark against the challenges which he believed were
confronting his family and the aristocracy as a whole during a period of
unprecedented social change. The Bibliotheca Lindesiana was thus a construction of
class, taste and distinction, which positioned Lindsay within centuries-old
traditions of elite collecting, exemplified by the Medici family upon whom he
overtly modelled himself.
Britain underwent profound social and cultural transformation in the midnineteenth century. Rapid industrialization, immigration from Ireland, and internal
migration from the countryside into towns created a deracinated urban population,
and weakened the traditional bonds between the nobility and client rural
communities; London became the capital of a global empire and the largest city in
the world. 1 The Oxford Movement, Catholic revival, evangelicalism and the rapid
expansion of Nonconformist denominations challenged the Established Church and
fractured the religious cohesion of the nation, while scientific naturalism led some
to question the fundamental tenets of Christian belief. 2 An emergent middle class,
drawn from the professional, mercantile and manufacturing sectors, assumed

increasing influence over the cultural and political life of Britain, prompting
Matthew Arnold, Mark Pattison and other defenders of high culture to rail against
its parochialism, narrow-mindedness and evangelical moralizing. 3 Its ascendancy
was facilitated by a proliferation of periodical publications directed at a bourgeois
readership, and by the development of academic and cultural institutions, many of
which promoted a centripetal, metropolitan dominance over provincial cultures. 4
While the Reform Act of 1832 was in reality a modest, conservative measure, which
substantially preserved landed interests, the Second Reform Act of 1867 extended
the franchise to the urban (male) proletariat, doubling the electorate and shifting
the balance of Parliamentary power decisively in favour of towns and cities. 5
Although it would be several more decades before the nobility was divested fully of
its political, cultural and economic power, the tectonic plates of British society had
begun to move inexorably by mid-century, generating intense debate around the
role of the aristocracy, and creating anxiety amongst the landed elite and its
apologists over the perceived threats to its hegemony and the implications for the
nation’s cultural prosperity. 6 Attacks came on several fronts: linguistic, political and
cultural. Social mobility was accompanied by volatility of language, and the
designator ‘gentleman’ was increasingly contested. 7 Seemingly anyone (or at least

Samuel Smiles’s Self-Help and other best-sellers catered to middle-class aspirations
to emulate the manners and tastes of their superiors. While radicals campaigned for
constitutional reform and curtailment of the aristocracy’s political powers, Arnold
argued that the nobility’s innate conservatism rendered it irrelevant, indeed an
impediment, to the cultural development of modern Britain:
Allowing, therefore, with Mr. Carlyle, the aristocratic class to possess
sweetness, culture insists on the necessity of light also, and shows us that
aristocracies, being by the very nature of things inaccessible to ideas, unapt
to see how the world is going, must be somewhat wanting in light, and must
therefore be, at a moment when light is our great requisite, inadequate to
our needs. 8
Lindsay was a resolute champion of the nobility, writing to The Times to defend the
aristocracy against the salvoes of John Bright, the Manchester free-trade radical. 9
He was also deeply interested in his family’s pedigree and invested enormous
energy and money into demonstrating and enhancing his own aristocratic
distinction. Exhaustive genealogical researches resulted in Lives of the Lindsays
(1840) and underpinned his successful claim, on behalf of his father, to the earldom
of Crawford in 1848. Not content with securing the premier earldom of Scotland,
Lindsay expended almost £12,000 in a vain (ambiguity intended) attempt to prove
entitlement to the dukedom of Montrose in 1853. 10 It is a plausible hypothesis that,

having failed to augment his symbolic capital by acquiring an additional title,
Lindsay diverted his energies and wealth into the library as an alternative means of
reinforcing his family’s cultural capital. There is circumstantial evidence to support
this proposition: annual expenditure on the library averaged £331 between 1851 and
1855, but leapt to £1,024 in the years 1856‒60. Lindsay exemplified the association
between collecting and dynastic ambition. 11
I intend to demonstrate that the Bibliotheca Lindesiana did not merely reflect the
social, cultural and political developments outlined above, but was intentionally
constructed by Lindsay as a direct response to and bastion against the challenges
which he believed were confronting his family and the aristocracy during this
period, in particular the twin threats of democracy and the erosion of the
aristocracy’s cultural authority. 12 In his epic poem Argo, Lindsay portrayed the
dangers of democracy in apocalyptic terms: ‘And Red Democracy, repress’d, but
coil’d | Ready to spring, and propagating foul | Her venomous offspring to pollute
the world.’ 13 He ardently believed in the continued relevance of the aristocracy:
noble families like the Lindsays were ideally positioned to perform a ‘cardinal’ role
in reconciling the opposing forces and interests of democracy and autocracy, of new
money derived from industry and commerce and older landed interests, of

innovation and continuity. 14 Lindsay’s intention was to build a library that would
contain ‘the best that is known and thought in the world’, to quote Arnold’s famous
phrase; the library would guide and educate the family in their duties and must
therefore be broad-based and catholic. He thus elevated the library to a matter of
national importance; it fulfilled a serious moral, political and cultural purpose to an
extent perhaps unmatched by any other aristocratic library in Britain.
Through a close reading of the Library Report, this chapter investigates how and
why Lindsay invoked the Medici as paradigms of elite collecting and patronage of
the arts. Contextualizing this self-modelling within wider Victorian responses to
medieval and Renaissance Italy, I contend that the aristocratic Lindsay reappropriated the Medici from William Roscoe and the merchants of Lancashire who
had usurped them for bourgeois civic purposes. I also explore Lindsay’s deeply
ambivalent attitude to trade, which was the source of his family’s wealth and thus
the basis upon which the library was created (in a conversion of economic to
cultural capital), but which threatened to pollute the library at Haigh Hall, both
materially and conceptually. Lindsay managed these anxieties, I argue, by displacing
them onto the equivocal characters of Cosimo de’ Medici (1389‒1464) and his
grandson Lorenzo (1449‒92).
Other questions that this chapter addresses include: How did the Library Report
contribute to Lindsay’s construction of his identity as a gentleman of taste and
learning, and how did he intend it to inculcate similar qualities in Ludovic? How
was Lindsay’s interest in the Medici and in Renaissance Italy manifested in his
collecting of books and manuscripts? How does Lindsay compare with other
collectors of Western manuscripts, in terms of their tastes for particular types of
manuscript and their degree of identification with the Medici and other
Renaissance collectors? Indeed, how distinct was he from other collectors?

5.2

‘Corinthian capital of polished society’: Cultivating the Qualities of a
Gentleman 15

The Library Report was originally addressed to Lindsay’s wife Margaret (‘Min’) and
her mother, Anne Lindsay, while his son Ludovic was referred to in the third
person. As I argued in Chapter 3, the two women played a significant – and
inadequately explored – role in the formation of the library. At some point in the
prolonged process of drafting the Report Lindsay decided to address his son
directly, for in a number of passages references to Ludovic have been amended from
the third person to the second, and in February 1865, while residing at the Villa
Caprini in Florence, Lindsay added a 12,000-word introductory letter to his son (see
Appendix 1). By then Ludovic was on the threshold of adulthood and beginning to
take an intelligent interest in the library. Lindsay may therefore have felt that it was
now appropriate and necessary to address his son directly, rather than through his
mother and grandmother. These amendments thus constitute a rite of passage for
the heir to the library and the earldom, and accord with Alberti’s recommendation
that paterfamilias should gradually permit their sons greater autonomy, in order to
prepare them ultimately to take full responsibility for the household. 16 As Russell
Belk notes, many collectors are preoccupied with the post-mortem fate of their
collections and one solution is to cultivate an heir. 17 The future survival and
prosperity of the library required Lindsay (now in his fifties) to school his son in its
stewardship, just as the aristocratic principle of primogeniture demanded a male
heir. These amendments to the Library Report thus represent a diminution of
female influence and (re)assertion of male heirdom and hegemony over the library.

In addressing his son directly, Lindsay was also following literary precedents. The
epistolary framing device was common to several genres, including scientific
communications, travel writing and fiction, and indeed had been employed by
Lindsay many years earlier in his account of his Middle Eastern travels. 18 In
particular, the Report is situated within an enduring tradition of letters of advice
from patrician fathers to their sons. Famous examples of epistolary exhortations
include Cicero’s De Officiis, the classical paradigm for subsequent paternal
admonitions, of which Lindsay possessed a ‘singularly beautiful’ copy of the editio
princeps; 19 Lorenzo de’ Medici’s precepts to his son Giovanni (the future Leo X),
upon his appointment as a teenage cardinal in 1492, with which Lindsay was
acquainted through Roscoe’s eulogistic Life of Lorenzo; 20 and Lord Chesterfield’s
posthumously published letters to his son Philip, spanning the years 1737 until the
latter’s death in 1768. 21
The Report functions at several levels simultaneously in guiding and instructing
Ludovic. First, and most obviously, Lindsay offers his son explicit advice and
exhortation on what constitutes appropriate conduct and good manners in the
management of the library, for example in being generous with loans of material to
scholars. Secondly, the Report constitutes a blueprint for the continued
development of the library, which would contain those texts deemed by Lindsay to

be essential for the edification of his son and other members of the family. Thirdly,
although both manners and modesty inhibit Lindsay from setting himself up overtly
as a paradigm for Ludovic to follow, it is clear that he wishes his son to emulate his
own refined tastes, especially in relation to the library, while acknowledging that
Ludovic’s collecting interests may differ from his own.
Clearly, these levels of influence upon Ludovic are imbricated and mutually
reinforcing. According to Bourdieu, ‘Taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier.
Social subjects, classified by their classifications, distinguish themselves by the
distinctions they make.’ 22 The library confirms Lindsay as a gentleman of taste and
refinement; it is the outward expression of his discrimination and gentlemanly
cultivation of a wide range of interests. As the inheritor of the library, Ludovic will
also assume these qualities, or at least that is his father’s aspiration and expectation.
The books within it also influence Lindsay’s taste and help to develop his intellect,
and he hopes that they will have a similarly beneficial effect upon Ludovic and
other members of the family; indeed, he explicitly collects in order to educate
present and future generations of the family. Thus a virtuous circle is established
wherein taste influences collecting practices, which in turn refine one’s taste,
thereby honing the collection, and so forth.
The obvious defect in any such scheme occurs when the collection is no longer the
external manifestation and product of the collector’s intellectual abilities and
inherent qualities, but becomes a superficial substitute for them, when the extrinsic
and the intrinsic diverge (just as Lorenzo’s letter can be read as a cynical manifesto
of the ‘art of gesture’, exhorting his son to attend to appearances rather than the
cultivation of innate virtues). 23 The Bibliotheca Lindesiana mapped so closely onto
Lindsay’s mind, as I demonstrated in Chapter 2, that it was perhaps inevitable that

Ludovic could never match his father’s self-identification with it. He did not possess
his father’s panoptical intellect and, contrary to Lindsay’s aspirations, his
engagement with the library did not engender much interest in academic pursuits.
This may help to account for the seeming eclecticism, verging on incoherence, of
his own collecting practices – as I noted in the preceding chapter – and to explain
why in acts of bibliographical lobotomy he was prepared to sell large parts of the
library. Indeed, at times in the Report Lindsay appears to sense that his son did not
share his enthusiasm for the library: he repeatedly apologizes for the Report’s
length and for specifying long lists of desiderata, as in this passage, which combines
self-deprecation with dense literary allusions to reinforce the message that the
library has served to develop his own erudition and civility:
This long list of titles must, I fear, have appeared to you as shadowy and
unsatisfactory as the dishes which were placed in succession before the
hungry Barmecide, or those which Sancho Panza was allowed to look at only
before they were whipped away by order of his physician in Barataria. I am
sorry for your disappointment, but it is only by an enumeration such as this
that I can fulfil the object of a Report like the present. 24
Lindsay considered himself and Ludovic as (merely) trustees of the library for future
generations: ‘the Library […] which in the course of years you will inherit, and will
view, I hope, in the light of a trust, to be transmitted, unimpaired, and perhaps in
augmented value, to posterity’. 25 Such sentiments exemplify the longue durée of the
aristocracy’s historical horizons – both prospective and retrospective – as expressed
in the widespread contemporary practice of entailing landed estates by means of
settlements. 26 Lindsay argues that great families leave their mark on history,
24

When Lindsay was involved in drawing up a family settlement in the early 1850s, he told

his father-in-law that ‘my object all along has been to secure the descent of the estates along
with the honours, retaining at the same time as free and unfettered a power of sale or
exchange as the law will allow under the conditions of an entail.’ Letter from Lindsay to
Colonel James Lindsay, 23 October 1851; CPP, 94/14, fols 64‒6. On settlements, see J. V.

building upon the successive achievements of previous generations, whereas the
lives of common folk (such as the colliers of Wigan) are evanescent: ‘the great
families of a nation – those that give it a history – do not rise and fall, generation
after generation, like ripples of the sea, leaving no trace behind, but are each (as it
were) perennial, rushing ever onward and pervading society like a flowing and Nilelike tide till the source that supplies their fount of being becomes exhausted.’ 27 His
words echo Ruskin’s warning to the businessmen of Manchester in 1857 that
advances in art and science are cumulative, founded upon but not superseding the
achievements of the past. 28 High culture could not be acquired overnight, or even in
a lifetime. Likewise, Pearce argues that collections both instantiate and structure
time through their gradual accumulation: ‘in order to be honourable and genuine,
collections must have been acquired over the years, and piece or group at a time.’ 29
This expansive historical perspective was fostered in Lindsay’s case by his extensive
researches into his family’s history, and by the development of a library which
documented cultures spanning millennia. He was conscious both of the place of the
Bibliotheca Lindesiana within the two-thousand-year history of great libraries, and
of the historical layering observable in libraries such as his, built up over
generations: ‘It is often very curious in an ancient family library […] to observe the
successive strata of literature, the deposits of successive generations, by which,
through legitimate induction, we are enabled to conclude with accuracy as to the
tastes of antiquary, divine, physiologist, or dilettante which successively governed
the characters and lives of those who collected it.’ 30 The library and its associated
archive have indeed preserved the traces – and evidence the tastes – of Lindsay and
Beckett, ‘The Pattern of Landownership in England and Wales, 1660‒1880’, Economic
History Review, 37.1 (1984), 1‒22.

other members of the family. However, as my earlier analysis of the Crawford
Library Papers has demonstrated, the active agency of the library and the archive, as
well as of Lindsay, in narrativizing the family’s history and achievements, should
not be overlooked.
The Report contains numerous passages in which Lindsay enjoins his son to observe
a gentlemanly, indeed chivalric code of ethics, as here where he exhorts Ludovic to
display the same generosity towards scholars as he has shown:
I have in an early page of this Report insisted on the principle of literary
Catholicity which has guided me in forming it, as for readers, among the
Lindsays and their friends, of many varied tastes and avocations. I would add
here that its treasures should, on sufficient cause shewn, and in the case of
trustworthy persons, be liberally communicated. I have frequently lent
books of great value to strangers known to me for their merits, and I have
never had reason to repent the confidence. […] Of course there is a
judgment, a discretion, to be exercised in such matters. Indiscriminate loans
of valuable books would be an equal error on the other side of the account.
[…] The owner of such treasures, who is likewise in a manner the custodier
and trustee of them for posterity, ought to provide for their safety, partly by
example, through the reverence with which he personally deals with them,
and partly (if necessary) by precept – conveyed in that effective but delicate
manner, and with the good-humoured smile, wherewith anything can be
said or done by a gentleman. 31
Lindsay invokes the gentlemanly qualities of judgment and discretion, and the
delicacy and good humour whereby ‘anything can be said or done by a gentleman’.
Such innate self-assurance and effortless good manners are clear manifestations of
Bourdieusian cultural and social capital:
The emphasis on manners, and through them on mode of acquisition,
enables seniority within a class to be made the basis of the hierarchy within
the class; it also gives the recognized possessors of the legitimate manner an
31

LR, Epilogue, pp. 16‒17.

212

absolute, arbitrary power to recognize or exclude. Manner, by definition,
only exists for others, and the recognized holders of the legitimate manner
and of the power to define the value of manners – dress, bearing,
pronunciation – have the privilege of indifference to their own manner (so
they never have to put on a manner). 32
By contrast, the parvenu is trapped in a choice between imitative hyperidentification and an ostentatious assertion of difference. A gentleman is, by
definition, someone who does not have to try hard to be a gentleman; he is one by
virtue of his family, upbringing, education, social networks, and indeed his library.
In fact, the Report was written during the mid-century period when the notion of
the ‘gentleman’ evolved from a signifier of social rank to a denominator of moral
qualities. It was thus an equivocal concept, subject to misinterpretation and
appropriation. Stefan Collini quotes Fitzjames Stephen’s observation on the fluidity
of the term in 1862, exactly contemporary with the Library Report: ‘In our own days,
though the notion of some degree of rank – such an amount of it, at least, as raises
the presumption of a good education – is still attached to the word “gentleman”,
moral and social meanings connected with it are constantly assuming greater
prominence.’ 33 It was therefore imperative for noblemen like Lindsay to (re)align
the aristocracy with the new moral connotations of the word ‘gentleman’, in order
to reinforce its traditional application as an indicator of social status, and to prevent
the two constructions of the term from bifurcating. The Report, and indeed the
formation of the library, can be seen as contributing to this endeavour.
There were numerous instances of gentlemanly conduct in Lindsay’s collecting
career; his behaviour towards other collectors was unimpeachable, and he was

quick to acknowledge others’ courtesies towards him. In Chapter 3 I noted that
Lindsay yielded a copy of the Tyndale Pentateuch to Henry Huth in 1857. Likewise,
when a copy of De Officiis appeared in the Libri sale of 1862, Quaritch persuaded
another collector to refrain from bidding against him. Lindsay wrote to
acknowledge Thomas Joyce’s courtesy in leaving the field, while simultaneously
warning that his aspiration to collect all the editiones principes was a ‘hopeless task’;
he had limited his own ambition to possessing fifteen or sixteen of the more
important editions. 34 In other words, the arriviste Joyce should heed the warning of
the ancient writers that he sought to acquire, follow the example of more measured
collectors such as Lindsay, and practise moderation (sophrosyne). 35 Lindsay
extended these courtesies from fellow collectors to the ‘better sort’ of bookseller, as
I demonstrated in Chapter 3, where I also argued that Lindsay was able to preserve
his aristocratic decorum by employing Quaritch to participate in the cut-and-thrust
of the salerooms.
Lindsay’s views on the didactic function of the library (as well as his immersion in
classical literature) are revealed in this reference to art books: ‘The value of these
artistic books in forming the taste when young, and in assistance and suggestion to
us when in riper years we dream of emulating the ancients in their own immortal
spheres, cannot be over-estimated; and therefore, I repeat, our deficiencies in this
department ought to be carefully and judiciously supplied.’ 36 However, a broader
statement of the mutually reinforcing influence of taste and book collecting occurs
in the introductory letter to Ludovic: ‘I proposed to myself as an object the
development of our library into one worthy of our family – not a mere
bibliomaniacal congeries of undigested accumulation, but a library of intrinsic

Lindsay’s suspicions that Joyce was not entirely ‘sound’ were later confirmed by Quaritch:

property in money-lenders hands.’ Private memorandum from Quaritch to Lindsay, 20

excellence, to contain the most useful and interesting books, old and new, in all
walks of literature.’ 37
Through his careful, controlled collecting, Lindsay differentiated himself from a
self-confessed bibliomaniac like Sir Thomas Phillipps, whose passion for parchment
broke all bounds of propriety. Phillipps spent between £200,000 and £250,000
during his fifty-year career, amassing sixty thousand manuscripts in his quest to
save them from destruction at the hands of gold-beaters and glue-makers. He
confessed that, ‘As I advanced, the ardour of the pursuit increased untill at last I
became a perfect Vello-maniac (if I may coin a word), and I gave any price that was
asked.’ 38 Phillipps admitted scholars to his manuscript midden, but the vicious feud
with his daughter and son-in-law, his ‘damn-your-eyes’ arrogance, intense rivalry
with other collectors, contempt for most booksellers and, above all, his allconsuming mania for parchment ensured that, while he may have been a baronet,
he was not a gentleman in the modern, virtuous sense. As the illegitimate son of a
Manchester calico printer, Phillipps’s gentlemanly credentials were doubly
doubtful. 39

Italian Renaissance which, being sufficiently distant from yet offering clear
correspondences with Victorian England, constituted a safe proxy for discussing
issues of identity, ethics and the individual’s place in society. 41
An important aspect of Lindsay’s project to reinforce his social and cultural
distinction, I shall contend, was a close engagement with Italy, and with Florence
especially, extending over half a century. Lindsay first encountered the city in 1829,
following the well-trodden route of the youthful aristocrat’s Grand Tour; he
returned in 1839 and 1840, during more extensive explorations of the peninsula in
the company of his future parents-in-law, James and Anne Lindsay; and in 1841‒42
he spent several weeks intensively studying the city’s art and architecture, in the
course of researches for what would become Sketches of the History of Christian Art
(1847). 42 In later life Lindsay adopted Florence as a second home, renting several
grand villas before purchasing the Villa Palmieri (Fig. 5.4) – the putative setting of
Boccaccio’s Decameron – where he died in 1880. Lindsay was enchanted with
Florence: his spirits were rejuvenated, his senses whetted; he was alive to the rich

Lindsay completed his monumental Library Report at the Villa Caprini, next door to
Landor’s house, in December 1864. 44 There too he added the introductory letter to
Ludovic, concluding it with a passage that is central to any consideration of his
engagement with Italy, and with Florence and the Medici in particular (p. 338
below). It begins with Lindsay’s ekphrastic description of his idyllic surroundings,
inspired by the saturated multisensory experience of gazing out over distant
Florence, listening to birdsong mingled with the peal of bells, and imbibing the
scent of spring flowers and loquats. 45 He then moves into different registers,
historical and literary, with references to ancient Thebes and to Gray’s poem
‘Farewell to Fiesole’. The former evokes the familiar trope of the immutability and
atemporality of the Italian landscape, famously expressed by Ruskin in Modern
Painters – ‘the links are unbroken between the past and the present’ 46 – while the

allusion to Gray hints at the English appropriation of Florence since the eighteenth
century. 47 These references also supports Viccy Coltman’s assertion that visitors’
experience of Italy was preconditioned by their classical education and reading;
they arrived with well-formed mentalities and expectations, for which they sought
confirmation, rather than being susceptible to new impressions. 48 Lindsay was
steeped in classicism, thanks to his schooling at Eton, where the curriculum, little
changed since the mid-eighteenth century, was dominated by rote learning of
Greek and Latin. 49 Classicism had a profound effect on Lindsay’s book collecting –
especially in his youth – and on his habitus; on one occasion he even dispelled a
headache by composing a Latin ode, which ‘formed itself in his mind without the
least exertion of his own’. 50
Lindsay redirects his gaze northwards, to the Villa Medici, which geographically
and figuratively dominates the landscape, and his attention switches to Cosimo and
Lorenzo de’ Medici, for whom he declares a life-long admiration. 51 He draws an

audacious parallel between his own family and the Medici: the two dynasties are
connected through their shared endeavour to use the wealth they derived from
commerce for the creation of libraries, converting economic into cultural capital.
Lindsay’s love of Florence is insufficient to explain his admiration and emulation of
the city’s most famous family. To understand this more fully, it is necessary to
examine the various appropriations of the Medici in late eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century Britain, for Lindsay was not alone in drawing parallels with the
Renaissance princes: they were enlisted by numerous individuals and groups to
reinforce their cultural and social pretensions. 52
In 1795 the Liverpool art collector William Roscoe published his popular and
influential hagiography, The Life of Lorenzo de’ Medici, in which he promoted his
subject as a paradigm for the synthesis of mercantile, artistic and political domains.
For Roscoe – the son of an innkeeper who became a prosperous attorney, politician,
collector and patron of Fuseli – Lorenzo provided a comfortable model upon which
to construct his self-image as a man who combined a successful commercial career
and considerable personal wealth with public benefaction. 53 Arline Wilson asserts

that ‘For Roscoe, Florence and its ruler came to symbolize the apotheosis of the
union between commerce and culture.’ 54 As a modern-day Lorenzo, Roscoe became
the most important influence on artistic patronage in Liverpool, the Florentine
classical revival under Lorenzo’s patronage paralleling, indeed inspiring, the
neoclassicism of Roscoe and his aristocratic sponsors such as Thomas Coke, earl of
Leicester. 55
As Manchester eclipsed Liverpool as the archetypal mercantile and industrial city of
the mid-nineteenth century, it deftly appropriated its rival’s carefully constructed
identification with the city-state of Florence. 56 The comparison was not without
solid foundations, commercial, political and architectural: Manchester’s wealth was

similarly built upon thriving textile and banking sectors; it was fiercely independent
of metropolitan influences; its governance was dominated by the mercantile classes;
and its streets were lined with grandiose warehouses modelled on Italian palazzi. 57
Florence also served as a focus for, and reinforcement of, a growing civic cultural
consciousness. Mid-century Manchester was determined to shed its reputation as a
philistine, muck-and-brass, industrial city, devoid of cultural refinements. 58 The
most conspicuous exemplification of this endeavour was the Art Treasures
Exhibition of 1857, the largest assemblage of privately-owned art ever attempted in
Britain. The exhibition’s official journal asserted a clear correlation between
Manchester and Florence, in terms remarkably similar to Lindsay’s rhetoric in the
Library Report: ‘Now she steps forward in her aggregate character to emulate the
glorious example of Florence of old, under her prince-merchants the De Medici, to
display to the world the richest collection of works of fine art the resources of the
country afford.’ 59 The exhibition was intended to demonstrate that commerce and
culture were complementary, not antagonistic; the Medici served as paradigms for

mercantile patronage of the arts, for the enlightened application of private wealth
to the civic good. 60
Thus Lindsay’s appropriation of the Medici is partially explained and justified by the
precedents established by Roscoe and the mercantile elites of Liverpool and
Manchester, who had adopted the Medici for civic purposes. And yet he skilfully
manipulates this analogy for his own ends. Whereas civic leaders emulated the
Medici in their commercial enterprises and in their use of private wealth to
aggrandize cities through civic architecture and the founding and enriching of
cultural institutions, Lindsay suggests that he is the true heir to the Medici, in
creating a private library and art collection which are open to others, albeit a select
few. He calls for a return to the Renaissance paradigm of the great collector who
makes his books, artworks and ‘wonders’ accessible to his patronage-network.
Indeed, his ambition (discussed in Chapter 3) was for the library to become a
nineteenth-century Platonic Academy, wishing that it ‘should bear an aspect,
thoroughly comfortable indeed, but still that of a sanctuary of learning and thought,
sacred to the Muses, where men and women may meet in converse on the common
ground of graceful cultivation’. 61
Lindsay also implies an additional, temporal connection with the Medici, insofar as
his family’s lineage reached back to the era of Cosimo and Lorenzo, and beyond.
The Lindsays had entire armies at their command when the Medici were arriviste
bankers, but the circumstances of feudal Scotland were unfavourable for the
collecting of books: ‘our revenues in actual coin […] were comparatively small, and
would not have availed for the collection of books or pictures, even had the taste for
such gear existed in those days in feudal Scotland.’ 62 Now the collieries of Wigan are
providing the means for Lindsay to make good this deficiency, and to build up the

Bibliotheca Lindesiana ‘after the example of the Medici’. Roscoe and the traders of
Lancashire could claim no such coeval connection. While Lindsay draws a clear
distinction between his ancestors’ unrefined tastes and the family’s more recent
cultural sophistication, he also implies that his cultural capital is superior to that of
modern financiers and industrialists because of its slow accumulation over
centuries. This emphasis on longevity accords with Bourdieu’s claim (echoing
Thorstein Veblen) that aristocratic marks of distinction (‘accumulated, crystallized
history’), such as titles, stately homes and art collections, simultaneously master
time and depend upon a surfeit of it for their acquisition. 63
The rightful succession to the Medici was thus a contested space, upon which were
displaced the tensions in Victorian society between a predominantly rural, landed
aristocracy (albeit, in cases such as the Lindsays, financially underpinned by their
commercial ventures), and the new urban, self-made industrial-mercantile elites.
The Medici were well positioned to fulfil a mediating role between town and
country, ancient and modern, new money and old, since they themselves were
ambivalent figures, at the epicentre of Florentine civic and mercantile life, while
maintaining magnificent country villas where they performed the role of landed
aristocrats. 64 Lindsay situated himself geographically and conceptually within the
liminal zone of the Medici’s suburban villas, where town and country met. He (and
they) could have his cake and eat it: enjoying the classically-inspired locus amœnus
while the civic amenities and cultural life of Florence were within easy reach;
celebrating and espousing aristocratic lineage and values while reaping the profits
of commerce. 65

Lindsay had an equivocal attitude to trade. He freely acknowledged that the family’s
wealth depended upon coal – ‘the growth of trade and commerce has, by a strange
recompense, afforded us, through the possession of coalfields in England, the
means of doing that which our more powerful ancestors, the contemporaries of
Cosimo, could not have compassed’ – and he followed his father’s example in being
closely involved in the running of the Wigan Coal & Iron Company. 66 Indeed, the
earls of Crawford were not unique as aristocratic entrepreneurs: the dukes of
Devonshire and Sutherland, the marquesses of Bute and Londonderry, and the earls
of Lonsdale and Fitzwilliam were all heavily implicated in mining and industrial
enterprises. 67
And yet the propinquity of Haigh Hall and the collieries of Wigan brought social
and material dangers. Lindsay’s class distinction required a social distancing from
the neighbouring working-class communities of Wigan; his father-in-law once
warned him to avoid ‘disagreeable intimacy with the Burrough’, when Lindsay
vistas, in accordance with the 19th-century taste for a secluded position in the countryside,
and ideal for the comforts to which the foreign upper classes were accustomed.’ Grazia
Gobbi Sica, The Florentine Villa: Architecture, History, Society (Abingdon: Routledge, 2007),
p. 98. Lindsay commented: ‘You have no idea what a number of Englishmen have
established themselves in the villas around Florence. The two finest, grand old piles half
villas, half castles, did belong to Englishmen 3 years ago – but one of them [the Villa
Salviati] has just been bought by Mario, the singer. What a degradation! Another
Englishman (Mr Leader) has bought 14 farms, with the view of forming a large estate in the
neighbourhood.’ Letter from Lindsay to Lord Crawford, 8 March 1856; CPP, 94/18, fol. 2816.

suggested hosting dinners for the townsfolk. 68 Materially (and ironically), the
collieries and foundries of Wigan, which helped to fund the library, were also
sources of industrial pollution that imperilled it. Lindsay lamented: ‘the abundant
and increasing dirt, produced by collieries, iron-works, and factories, and the
humidity of the atmosphere for which South Lancashire is remarkable, are very
prejudicial to the health of the object of my present solicitude, the books.’ 69 In a
parallel to contemporary discourse over the relocation of the National Gallery’s
collections outside London, in response to the perceived threats of air pollution and
irruptions of common folk who had no appreciation of fine art, Lindsay
contemplated transplanting the library to Dunecht in rural Aberdeenshire, as I
discussed earlier (p. 78). He drew up plans for a library wing constructed ‘in the
Italico-Lombard style, but with perhaps a more massive character, in remembrance
of the old Florentine palaces, the Riccardi, Strozzi, and others’. 70 Lindsay’s
(unrealized) dream was to immure himself in a library closely modelled upon those
of his Renaissance paradigms, the Medici or the Strozzi.
Ultimately, however, Lindsay’s appropriation of the Medici proved deeply
problematical. Sismondi and Montalembert had already exposed the Medici as
contentious figures, simultaneously patrons of the arts and murderous tyrants. 71
Burckhardt and Symonds also equivocated, emphasizing the Medici’s cultural

achievements while acknowledging their despotic tendencies. 72 If elites regarded
democracy with deep suspicion in the 1860s – Burckhardt was as hostile to it as
Lindsay – by the end of the century it had become normalized in Britain and
national and municipal authorities assumed greater responsibility for the
promotion and patronage of culture, displacing individual, private endeavour. 73 The
model of cultural benefaction embodied in the Medici was now discredited as
elitist. In a self-congratulatory paean to municipal munificence, the Lord Provost of
Glasgow proclaimed in 1896: ‘And so it was with the emperors and kings, with the
ruling families, the Medicis and other Italian tyrants; their patronage of art and
science and their magnificent collections were not for the people, but for their own
selfish gratification and for the ostentatious display of their wealth and power.’ It
was now time for democratic municipalities to collect ‘for the instruction and the
gratification of the people at large’. 74

However, it is a testament to the potency of Medicean myth-making in the
nineteenth century that Lindsay emulated Cosimo and Lorenzo, despite their
equivocalness, while overlooking the arguably closer correspondence between
himself and another Florentine family, the Strozzi. 75 Like Lindsay, the Strozzi had a
distinguished pedigree: they were one of the oldest patrician families in Florence,
larger, richer and more powerful than the Medici at the beginning of the fifteenth
century. Palla di Nofri, by far the wealthiest man in Florence in 1427, was a notable
patron of the arts and other members of the family are known to have collected
manuscripts. 76 However, Palla’s financial and political fortunes collapsed when he
was exiled by the Medici in 1434, rendering him a questionable role-model for
Lindsay; the Strozzi’s vicissitudes epitomize the precarious foundations of the
mercantile aristocracy in Renaissance Florence. Moreover, as Crabb and
Goldthwaite have argued, the Strozzi were primarily concerned to protect l’onore e
l’utile (the honour or prestige and profit or advantage) of themselves as individuals
and of the family; their artistic patronage was one means to achieve this end. 77 The
Medici were similarly motivated (as was Lindsay himself, of course), but they acted
on an even grander scale and, through their self-identification with the city, their
patronage was elevated to the status of a civic enterprise. They may therefore have
appeared to be more appropriate paradigms for Lindsay, who advocated the
enlightened application of private wealth for public benefaction, not merely for
personal aggrandisement.
In fact, Lindsay’s Medicean analogy was deeply flawed: as arriviste bankers lacking
aristocratic pedigree, the Medici were more comparable with the merchants and

industrialists of nineteenth-century Britain than with the heir to Scotland’s senior
earldom. Furthermore, in his patronage of contemporary artists and writers,
Lindsay does not sustain comparison with either the Medici or the Strozzi.
Although he had early ambitions to foster a revival of fresco-painting and, like
many visitors to Italy in the pre-photographic era, he commissioned copies of
frescoes and panel paintings that he encountered on his travels, he did not collect
nineteenth-century art or patronize artists, preferring the early Italian masters. 78 It
is one of the ironies of nineteenth-century art history that the Pre-Raphaelites,
inspired by the early Italian art that Lindsay himself had championed, were largely
patronized by middle-class industrialists. 79 However, the comparison with the
Medici does have validity when one considers the scale, quality and diversity of his
collecting of books, manuscripts and works of art. Lindsay was a modern Medici: he
shared their fascination with the literary and material legacy of classical antiquity,
as well as with Oriental objects, which demonstrated the cosmopolitan reach of
their commercial, political and patronal networks. 80

How was Lindsay’s interest in the Medici and in Renaissance Italy manifested in his
collecting of books and manuscripts? The Library was, unsurprisingly, rich in works
of Italian literature, history and genealogy, from the fifteenth century to the midnineteenth. These were acquired over many years, both through London dealers
such as Molini and Quaritch, and locally during Lindsay’s frequent visits to Italy. 81

During a tour of Italy in 1842, his carriage became a travelling library: ‘there literally
is not a corner vacant – there are books above and books below and books
everywhere – I cant make out how they accumulate so.’ 82 Over several pages of the
Library Report Lindsay enumerates the most important of the Italian works,
concluding:
A stranger might be surprised (but you will not be so) at finding so many
books of this description in a British library. I have not assembled them
together without a motive. Italy has always been to me as a second home,
and one of my early dreams was to write a book of travels in which the
mediaeval and romantic story recorded in these local annals and attaching
to her picturesque towns and noble old castles might have a prominent
place, standing out in light and shade and personal distinctness in front of
the general background furnished by Muratori and Sismondi. The peculiar
and instinctive feeling, as much Celtic as Teutonic, which clothes every ruin
in Scotland or on the Rhine with ivy-wreaths of tradition, is not native to
Italy – a roofless castle is but a heap of dead stones to the peasant of Tuscany
or Naples – he lives in the present, not the past – the great names of the
middle ages, Caraffa, Colonna, Orsini, Della Jherardesca, Pepoli, Carrara, are
to him empty breath – traditions, in the Northern sense of the word, there
are few or none – it is only in these obscure local histories that the passing
and recent events are recorded which an appreciative traveller might hang as
a votive offering on the hoary and desecrated walls to which he makes his
summer pilgrimage. 83

This passage is noteworthy as an example of the English infantilization of Italians,
who were habitually characterized as ignorant and undeserving of their rich cultural
patrimony; it was therefore the responsibility of the English to preserve and
interpret it on behalf of Italians and the rest of humanity. In Sketches of the History
of Christian Art, Lindsay had appealed to the rulers of Italy ‘in behalf of the grand
old frescoes which are either perishing unheeded before their eyes, or that lie
entombed beneath the whitewash of barbarism, longing for resuscitation, pining for
the light of day’. Likewise, Ruskin mourned the destructive modernization of
Florence, ‘the wreck of it being now too ghastly and heart-breaking to any human
soul that remembers the days of old’. 84
Elsewhere in the Report it is clear that the library augments, indeed partially
substitutes for, Lindsay’s direct experiences of Italy. For example, his collection of
atlases and illustrated topographical books enables him to walk the streets of Rome
and Florence in his imagination, as a flâneur of the printed page, just as, like Goethe
before him, his actual explorations, his ‘watchful wandering’, of the cities were
informed and enriched by the knowledge accreted through years of study in the
library: ‘You can take a walk in the bird’s eye views of Rome or Florence in these
forgotten volumes (fancy in abstraction supplying the blue sky, sweet breeze, and
balmy sunshine) as easily and agreeably as you can in the actual localities.’ 85

These Roman views [by Rossi and Piranese], and the two series by Zocchi
representing Florence […] enable us, in conjunction with the plans given by
Zeller and other old topographers, to retrace, as it were, the steps of Time,
and transport ourselves into the very Rome and Florence of one hundred
and two hundred years ago. 86
In a period when Florence and Rome were experiencing rapid architectural and
topographical transformation, the library elided all traces of modernity in Lindsay’s
imagination. 87 Moreover, in his ‘ambulatory contemplation’, Lindsay implicates
himself in a literary trope that extended back to the classical period, which
associated walking with intellectual and meditative activity, and thus his flânerie,
while anticipating the experience of the detached, alienated urban wanderer of the
late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, also reinforces his classical cultural
credentials. 88
Lindsay’s emulation of the Medici manifested itself in a number of printed items
which had particular associations with the Florentine family. For example, he
possessed a fine copy of Lorenzo’s Poesie Volgari (Venice, 1554). 89 He also owned an
‘important series of engravings after the collection of the Medici at Florence, then as
now preserved in the Palazzo Pitti, […] a series very seldom indeed to be met with’,

(?1480), the record of the conferences of the Platonic Academy at Carreggi; this was
later acquired by Ludovic. 90
However, when one examines the manuscript portion of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana,
there is little evidence that Lindsay identified with the Medici in his collecting
practices. While he employed the Medici as paradigms of elite collecting, he did not
aspire to collect manuscripts directly associated with them, and indeed refrained
from doing so when the opportunity arose. For example, he bought several
manuscripts at the Tite sale in 1874, but ignored a luxurious psalter and hymnal
commissioned by a member of the Medici family, which went to Quaritch. 91 In fact,
as I previously observed, Lindsay claimed not to be a collector of manuscripts per se
and sought only representative examples of Italian Renaissance manuscripts: ‘I have
never as yet allowed myself to be tempted by those gorgeous and beautiful
European MSS. the purchase of which would have interfered with the steady
prosecution of my other plans. We have nothing, in a word, to put in competition
with the treasures that Robert Holford has accumulated of this description at
Dorchester House.’ 92
In total Lindsay acquired some twenty manuscript codices of Italian provenance,
the majority of which date from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. 93 He
eschewed horae, gargantuan choirbooks and individual miniatures to which many
amateur collectors were attracted, and sought instead representative and

superlative examples of Italian art and calligraphy, and textually interesting
manuscripts, to complement his outstanding collections of Italian paintings and
printed books. He was not remotely interested in accruing luxurious manuscripts as
tokens of his wealth and taste. A possible explanation for this will be considered
shortly.
One of Lindsay’s first purchases was a splendid copy of the poems of Dante and
Petrarch (Fig 5.3). The colophon records that it was written by the scribe Paul for
Lorenzo di Carlo Strozzi, who died in 1383. It featured in Guglielmo Libri’s sale of
March 1859 but, unlike many of that notorious biblioklept’s books, this one had an
unimpeachable provenance. Lindsay decided to bid up to £150 for it, but Quaritch
was obliged to go as high as £250 against competition from Thomas Boone. 94
In 1866 Lindsay paid Boone £200 for a three-volume manuscript of Nicolas de Lyra’s
Bible Commentary, Postilla super Bibliam, written by Ugolino Marini Gibertuzzi of
Sarnano and completed in 1402, and later presented by Ludovico Gonzaga to the
Franciscan convent in Mantua. It is a superb example of Italian illumination, quite
unlike anything else in the Bibliotheca Lindesiana. 95 Two years later Boone
contacted Lindsay with the astonishing claim that he had what he believed to be
‘the finest Illuminated Book ever offered for sale’, the splendid six-volume Missal of
Cardinal Pompeio di Girolamo Colonna, a truly remarkable piece of High
Renaissance art. The dealer suggested hopefully that the miniatures might be by
Raphael himself, or ‘certainly under the superintendence of this great Master’.
Hilary Fraser has shown that in the mid-nineteenth century, ‘Raphael was the
undisputed embodiment of the classical achievement of the High Renaissance’, and
works were therefore frequently attributed to him on slight evidence. 96 Boone
forwarded the volumes on inspection, proposing the ‘moderate’ price of £1,500 and

claiming that they ‘should be cheap at even double the price now asked’. Lindsay
disagreed with the attribution, but he was particularly impressed with the
‘extraordinary beauty’ of the first volume, and asked whether Boone could be
induced to part with it separately. Fortunately the bookseller refused to break up
the set, and Lindsay finally agreed to buy all six volumes in three instalments of
£500. 97
Not all of Lindsay’s purchases were splendidly illuminated manuscripts. An example
of an undecorated but textually interesting item is a fifteenth-century copy of the
Divina Commedia, from the library of Seymour Kirkup of Florence, famous for his
discovery of the Bargello portrait of Dante in 1840. It was a suitable companion to
the magnificent Landino edition of Dante (Florence, 1481), which Lindsay had
obtained from Quaritch in 1867. 98

‘Comparisons are odorous’: Asserting Distinction in Relation to
Other Collectors 99

When Lindsay’s manuscript-collecting practices are compared with those of the
Rothschild family, the differences are striking. Several members of the banking
dynasty purchased illuminated manuscripts and books of astonishing luxury and
pedigree, including items associated with the Medici and Strozzi families. Salomon
de Rothschild, for example, purchased a splendid manuscript of Josephus,
illuminated by Attavante for the Medici family; his brother, Edmond James, owned
the manuscript of the Strozzi family’s wedding poem, Carmen Nuptiale, also
illuminated by Attavante; and Anselm Salomon von Rothschild possessed a prayer
book of Leo X. Other members of the extended family owned breath-taking items
such as a volume of the Très Belles Heures, and the Belles Heures of the duc de
Berry. 100 Christopher de Hamel has noted the close cultural and commercial
parallels between the Rothschilds and their Florentine precursors: ‘It must have
been natural for Rothschilds to recognise a cultural kinship and to delight in
manuscripts commissioned by their professional predecessors. The acquisition of a
shelf of luxurious illuminated manuscripts of the high renaissance would have been
a logical step for any Rothschild.’ 101 Likewise, the New York financier J. Pierpont
Morgan, whose collections of books, works of art and objets de virtu would by the

In the Library Report, Lindsay favourably compares the theological department of his

library with those of Lord Spencer and Thomas Grenville, adding: ‘But comparisons, as Mrs.
Malaprop says, “are odorous”, and I will therefore only say that I have been fortunate in
bringing down so many fine birds on a moor where the birds are so few, shy, and wild.’ LR,

turn of the century eclipse those of the earls of Crawford, obtained a number of
manuscripts associated with the Medici. 102
The explanation for this contrast between Lindsay’s disregard of Medicean
manuscripts and the Rothschilds’ and Morgan’s attraction to them lies, I propose, in
the degrees of correspondence between the Medici and their respective nineteenthcentury emulators, and in the relative security of the latter’s social positions. The
careers of Morgan and the Rothschilds mapped more closely on to those of the
Medici than did Lindsay’s. Like their Renaissance forebears, they were men of
plebeian origins who rapidly acquired unparalleled wealth from their banking
enterprises. While they did not follow the Medici’s example and become statesmen,
through their loans to governments they were able to exercise a degree of indirect
political influence. Yet their social capital depended almost entirely on their
financial fortunes and it was therefore precarious, subject to the vagaries of the
capitalist system, whereas Lindsay’s was corroborated by his aristocratic lineage.
Moreover, in nineteenth-century Europe where anti-Semitism was endemic, the
Rothschilds were additionally disadvantaged by their ethnicity. As de Hamel puts it,
‘The Rothschilds were one of the most ennobled and most highly connected
families of Europe, but they were nevertheless Jews. No one quite forgot.’ 103 There
was therefore an element of hyper-identification and literality in the Rothschilds’
and Morgan’s imitation of the Medici; they adopted the accoutrements of wealth
and patronage in order to acquire and then consolidate social respectability, using
deluxe books and manuscripts associated with the Medici to buttress their volatile

Examples now in the Morgan Library include manuscripts of Theophrastus and

Xenophon from the Toovey collection (MS M.118 and MS M.244); a copy of Lorenzo’s Rime

cultural capital, and constructing proxy family pedigrees through the provenance of
their possessions. 104
Lindsay, by contrast, abjured the refined ‘cabinet’ style of collecting perfected by the
brewer Henry Perkins and by various members of the Rothschild dynasty, choosing
instead to build an extensive, encyclopaedic library. ‘Amateurs again, especially in
Paris, and of the generally of the nouveaux-riches class, [sic] have devoted
themselves to the formation of small and special collections, cabinets instead of
libraries, suitable to their restricted dwelling-places.’ 105 Moreover, he regarded the
Medici as paradigms of elite patronage and collecting in a broad sense but,
exemplifying aristocratic self-assurance and ‘ease’ (sprezzatura), felt no compulsion
to associate himself with them directly through the acquisition of manuscripts with
a Medicean provenance. 106 This was despite the pride manifested throughout the
Library Report over books with an illustrious provenance – perhaps unconsciously
echoing the preoccupation with his own pedigree.
Turning from the highest echelons of manuscript collecting during the nineteenth
century to the lower strata, one finds a group of collectors who were associated with
commerce and industry, including William Bragge (engineering), Sir Thomas
Brooke (textiles), Frank McClean (engineering), Henry Huth (banking), and C. W.

Dyson Perrins (condiments). These were not self-made men – they came from
middle-class backgrounds and several attended public schools – but in the
precarious world of nineteenth-century industry and commerce they sought to
consolidate their respectability and their positions within the ranks of metropolitan
and provincial elites, and they treated their collections of books and manuscripts as
external manifestations of their hard-won distinction. 107 Bragge, for example, the
son of a Birmingham jeweller, made a fortune from railway and engineering
enterprises in Europe, South America and Egypt, and assembled one of the most
diverse and interesting manuscript collections in the nineteenth century. In 1874 he
lent eighty-five items to an exhibition of manuscripts at the Burlington Fine Arts
Club (over half the total) and thus cemented his position at the heart of the
metropolitan art establishment. When two years later he experienced financial
difficulties and was compelled to sell his library, Sotheby’s described it as a
collection ‘formed by a gentleman of consummate taste and judgement’, without
identifying its owner. Notwithstanding the auctioneers’ customary hyperbole, this
was a resounding endorsement of Bragge’s cultural capital: the manuscripts
confirmed (at least temporarily) his status as a gentleman.
Most of these bourgeois collectors showed a distinct preference for horae and other
richly illuminated devotional manuscripts from the late medieval period. In an era
of industrial mass production, they may have been attracted to manuscripts –
unique, handmade, distinctive objects – in absolute contrast to the standardized
goods they manufactured or traded, but they were nevertheless locked into a serial
mentality, collecting on an industrial scale. 108 For example, Brooke possessed
thirteen horae and seven missals; Huth owned twenty-four horae and four psalters;
107

They were generally second- and third-generation bourgeoisie; Brooke attended

Cheltenham College, McClean Westminster School and Glasgow University, Perrins
Charterhouse and Oxford. This pattern conforms with the analysis of Macleod, Art.
108

On the seriality of the industrial era, see Jean Baudrillard, Simulations, trans. by Paul

Foss, Paul Patton and Philip Beitchman (New York: Semiotext(e), 1983), pp. 91–114; Jean
Baudrillard, ‘The Structural Law of Value and the Order of Simulacra’, in The Structural
Allegory: Reconstructive Encounters with the New French Thought, ed. John Fekete
(Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1984), pp. 54–73.

238

the McClean collection included thirty-four horae, fifteen psalters and six
breviaries; and Bragge could boast of no less than seventy-one horae and offices,
eighteen missals and fourteen psalters. 48% of Bragge’s Western manuscripts dated
from the fifteenth century, and 53% of Huth’s, whereas they constituted just 28.5%
of Crawford manuscripts. 109 This position-taking within the field of book and
manuscript collecting is typical of less well-established, less secure participants,
who generally play safe and ‘follow the crowd’. In their collecting practices such
‘new men’, especially in their early careers, are more likely to be guided by the
parameters of the market and to follow the recommendations of experts such as
Quaritch; they are less willing to deviate from consensus positions. This behaviour,
wherein ‘avidity combines with anxiety’, accords with Bourdieu’s observation that:
‘the entry of the petite bourgeoisie into the game of distinction is marked, inter alia,
by the anxiety of exposing oneself to classification by offering to the taste of others
such infallible indices of personal taste as clothes or furniture.’ 110
Ruskin deprecated such superfluity in art collecting, excoriating the pride and
vanity with which industrialists accumulated pictures in order to enhance their
‘gentility’. But he also acknowledged the allure of a well-illuminated missal, or ‘fairy
cathedral full of painted windows’. He managed to reconcile these moral and
aesthetic judgements, justifying to himself his collecting of manuscripts on the
grounds of utility, deploying them as source material for his research and teaching
on the political economy and history of art, even breaking them up and framing
decorative initials. ‘Missals’, he is said to have written, ‘for use, not for curiosities’. 111

The work of Arjun Appadurai affords a fuller understanding of the role that luxury
goods such as illuminated manuscripts performed in the nineteenth century.
Refining Veblen’s concept of conspicuous consumption, whereby members of the
‘leisure class’ demonstrate their superiority by accumulating hand-crafted luxury
objects, Appadurai argues that such goods should not be considered distinct from
necessities, ‘but as goods whose principal use is rhetorical and social, goods that are
simply incarnated signs. The necessity to which they respond is fundamentally
political.’ 112 From this perspective, the collections of Bragge, Huth and other
bourgeois should not be dismissed as mere exercises in conspicuous consumption,
containing expensive, hand-made objects with minimal utility value. Rather they
served as ‘incarnated signs’ of their owners’ wealth and discrimination, and by this
measure at least they were just as functional as the library that Lindsay had built
upon the principle of utility.
The Bibliotheca Lindesiana was likewise an ‘incarnated sign’ of Lindsay’s wealth and
status. After all, he spent over £65,000 on the library in the period 1850‒80,
purchasing copies of the 42-line (Gutenberg) Bible (costing £595), Mainz Catholicon
(£500), First Folio (£525), and the Colonna Missal (£1,500). 113 On the other hand, as a
dominant figure in the field of collecting, he exemplifies the connoisseur whose
seemingly innate knowledge and taste are actually acquired through a lifetime’s
study of and familiarity with cultural objects, and who, knowing the ‘rules’ of
collecting, is perfectly comfortable with breaking them and indeed redefining them.
According to Bourdieu, ‘Connoisseurship is an “art” which, like the art of thinking
or the art of living, cannot be imparted entirely in the form of precepts or
in 1864’, in Sesame and Lilies, The Ethics of the Dust, The Crown of Wild Olive: With Letters
on Public Affairs, 1859‒1866, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn, Library Edition of

good books.

instruction, and apprenticeship to it presupposes the equivalent of prolonged
contact with the work (or with works of the same class).’ 114 Lindsay, and Ludovic,
did not need to collect countless horae in order to demonstrate their taste and
distinction. Instead, they adopted an alternative strategy and distinguished
themselves from other (lesser) collectors by deliberately eschewing such material: a
double movement of distinction. Bourdieu argues that excellence ‘consists in being
what one is, with reserve and understatement, urbanely hinting at the immensity of
one’s means by the economy of one’s means, refusing the assertive, attentionseeking strategies which expose the pretensions of the young pretenders’. 115
Lindsay’s purchases of Western manuscripts were, like Ruskin’s, highly selective
and purposeful – representative examples of the finest schools of illumination;
Carolingian and other early manuscripts; and undecorated but textually significant
codices. Ludovic, reacting against his father’s restraint and seeking to imprint his
own identity upon the library, was eclectic in his tastes, fond of jewelled bindings,
and early manuscripts, whether from Visigothic Spain or the Ottonian empire. 116
But both men regarded their Western manuscripts as but one component of an
expansive library that encompassed material from across the globe, as I explored in
the previous chapter. It is this ambition that sets them apart from ‘cabinet’-style
collectors, even those of the calibre of the Rothschilds.

Conclusion

Lindsay constructed the Bibliotheca Lindesiana to affirm and enhance his social and
cultural distinction, at a time when the hegemony of the landed aristocracy seemed
threatened by democracy and by an increasingly powerful bourgeoisie. He also
intended the library to educate his son and future generations of Lindsays, not in a
narrow, utilitarian sense, but by training their minds and refining their tastes in
order to prepare them as gentlemen (and ladies) to assume the heavy
responsibilities of their class. Thus the library and the family would serve as
bastions of the high culture that Lindsay – like Arnold – believed was imperilled by
middle-class philistinism and radical democracy. In this endeavour he overtly, if
problematically, modelled himself upon the Medici, as paradigms of elite collecting
and the enlightened patronage of culture, reclaiming them from Roscoe and the
mercantile elites of Manchester and Liverpool.
However, unlike the Rothschilds and Morgan, whose financial careers mapped
closely onto those of the Medici, Lindsay had no need to overidentify with his
Renaissance paradigms by collecting manuscripts directly associated with them.
Likewise, in a double movement of distinction, Lindsay and Ludovic distanced
themselves from bourgeois collectors by eschewing late-medieval horae and other
private devotional works, demonstrating their true distinction through ‘reserve and
understatement’, rather than the ‘attention-seeking strategies’ of their competitors.
Despite his endeavours to construct a library to serve the present and future needs
of the Lindsay family, neither his son Ludovic nor his grandson Bal were savants of
Lindsay’s calibre. In any case, by the late nineteenth century the gentleman-scholar
had largely been displaced by the academy and increasing disciplinarity, as I
explored in Chapter 2, and the political influence of the aristocracy was rapidly
diminishing. Although Bal held high office before and during the First World War,
it would be difficult to argue that the library prepared him for political life. Yet
Chapter 3 demonstrated that both Ludovic and Bal were exceptionally well
connected within the networks of connoisseurship and elite collecting. Jane Ridley
perceptively observes that Bal ‘moved from politics, where a hereditary peer had
nowhere to go beyond junior office, to an art world where he had a real
contribution to make’, thus confirming Andrea Geddes Poole’s assertion that in the
242

twentieth century the aristocracy ‘were relegated from the pivot points of power to
positions of show with little substance’. 117
Thus, if Lindsay failed in his wider aspiration to buttress the social and political
standing of the Lindsay family and of the aristocracy in general, the Bibliotheca
Lindesiana at least endowed subsequent generations of his family with a cultivated
habitus and sufficient cultural capital to achieve prominence within the narrower
ambit of the art establishment.

6 Conclusion

6.1

Summary of Research Problematics and Findings

The principal problematic that I have addressed in this thesis can be summarized
thus: why did Lindsay and Ludovic invest vast amounts of financial and cultural
capital to create one of the greatest private libraries of the nineteenth century, and
why, more specifically, did they assemble one of the most significant collections of
manuscripts in Britain? From this derive several further questions, including: what
specific functions did the manuscripts perform, and how closely assimilated were
they with the rest of the library, which predominantly comprised printed material?
I have argued that explanations for the library’s development must be sought both
in contemporary issues of class and social change, race and empire, and the
classification and organization of knowledge, and in the individual characteristics
and interests of the earls of Crawford and the particular socio-economic
circumstances of the Lindsay family. These two clusters of factors – structural and
specific – are in fact broadly imbricated and cannot be treated in isolation: the
Bourdieusian concepts of capital, habitus and field have helped to elucidate how
wider issues played out in the development of the library; how the earls of Crawford
were shaped by their privileged backgrounds, education, social positions and
networks; and how they and the library in turn influenced the wider spheres of
bibliophily, library science, taxonomies and classification schemes, nascent
academic disciplines, racial and imperialist discourses, and elite taste.
Lindsay’s intent was to create a universal, panoptical library which would serve the
present and future research requirements of the Lindsay family and of a wider circle
of associates and scholars. This utilitarian ambition was founded upon a holist
philosophy that averred the unity and interconnectedness of all human knowledge.
Thus the library afforded Lindsay a comprehensive perspective across broad
geographical, chronological and cultural horizons. However, it is imperative to
contextualize the library’s development within wider performative and
epistemological trends during the nineteenth century, such as the staging of
248

expositions universelles, growing interest in ‘primitive’ societies, and the advance of
comparative religion and anthropology. The quest for conspectus and control was a
response to the expansion and ramification of knowledge, the complexification of
Western societies, and encounters with an array of indigenous cultures in the
colonial ‘contact zone’.
Lindsay also developed the library explicitly to reinforce his own and his family’s
social and cultural distinction, at a time when emergent democracy and an
increasingly powerful bourgeoisie challenged the landed aristocracy’s hegemony.
The library was designed to educate Ludovic and succeeding generations and to
inculcate refined tastes, in order to prepare them to assume the nobility’s
responsibility for leadership of the nation and empire. The library and the family
would thus serve as bastions of the high culture that was imperilled by middle-class
philistinism and radical democracy.
In this enterprise Lindsay overtly modelled himself upon the Medici, whom he
regarded as paradigms of elite collecting and enlightened cultural patronage. In
fact, his appropriation of the Medici proved problematical, both because he
overplayed the parallels between his family and their Florentine antecedents, who
were gente nuova, and because the Medici were contentious figures, simultaneously
patrons of the arts and tyrants.
Ludovic’s motives for continuing to develop the library after his father’s death are
more opaque. He retreated from Lindsay’s policy of building a catholic library,
focusing instead on specific (and more realizable) fields such as papyri. Like other
second-generation collectors, he sought to differentiate himself from his father, to
leave his own distinctive mark upon the library. However, he was also responding to
wider societal and epistemological trends, which had rendered Lindsay’s vision
obsolete: by the late nineteenth century, a growing network of public and academic
libraries had undermined the raison d’être of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana as a major
research library in private ownership. It also became increasingly difficult for
Ludovic to compete with institutional libraries and wealthy American collectors in
the market for the finest rare books and manuscripts.

249

Manuscripts performed important functions within the Bibliotheca Lindesiana.
Lindsay professed not to collect manuscripts per se, acquiring only ‘a few valuable
specimens illustrative of the calligraphy of different ages and countries’. Adhering
to utilitarian principles, he generally eschewed the obvious attractions of Western
illuminated manuscripts, although his principles were sufficiently flexible to
accommodate some spectacular items such as the Colonna Missal. However,
because of the late adoption of print in many Eastern cultures, Lindsay was obliged
to acquire indigenous manuscripts in order to document the faiths, literatures and
histories of these societies. Thus from the 1860s onwards he assembled one of the
most significant collections of Oriental books and manuscripts in Britain.
Ludovic did not share his father’s utilitarian principles of collecting. From 1884
onwards he acquired many important manuscripts in the major auctions that
punctuated this period. He had a passion for jewelled bindings, early manuscripts
from Visigothic Spain and Carolingian texts, and he was more susceptible to the
allure of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, such as Lydgate’s Troy Book. Like his
father, Ludovic differentiated himself from bourgeois collectors who were locked
into a serial mindset and collected horae and other richly illuminated late-medieval
manuscripts on an industrial scale.
The status and organization of the manuscripts within the library evolved over
time. When Lindsay composed the Library Report, individual manuscripts occupied
a liminal position, assigned to the impermanent ‘Museum or curiosity’ department.
This reflected their ambiguous status (combining features of art objects and printed
books) and Lindsay’s ambivalent and contradictory attitude towards these special
items. He liberally acknowledged the achievements of the more advanced nonWestern cultures and devoted considerable attention to Orientalia in the Library
Report; there is no suggestion that they were subordinate to their occidental
counterparts and there was a high degree of physical and intellectual integration
between European and Oriental materials. Later, as the manuscript collections
grew, especially under Ludovic’s hegemony, they gradually sedimented out from the
printed books to form discrete sections of the library, while the Oriental materials
were explicitly subordinated to their western equivalents. This trend reflected, I

250

have suggested, the hardening of racial and colonial attitudes in the European
empires towards the end of the century.

I have also addressed the question of how (and how successfully) Lindsay and
Ludovic maintained physical and intellectual control over this rapidly growing
library. Anxieties over ‘information overload’ are as old as libraries, but were
particularly acute in the nineteenth century, due to the rapid expansion of printed
matter. Both father and son were deeply interested in and made contributions to
the theory and practice of library classification. Lindsay’s life-long fascination with
the subject led to his developing several classification schemes, which modulated
between idealized (and highly fissile) taxonomies and practical proposals for the
organization of actual collections such as his own. He made little attempt to
document the library, beyond compiling basic accession lists. The library was his
creature, the extrinsic manifestation of his mind, and he had no need of external
devices such as catalogues to exercise control over it, relying instead on his
prodigious memory and haptic familiarity with the topography of the library.
Unsurprisingly, Ludovic was unable to replicate his father’s self-identification with
and intellectual control over the library. Instead he initiated major campaigns to
catalogue the various departments, including the manuscripts. He withdrew from
day-to-day management of the library, relying instead on an expanding cohort of
professional staff, and exercising control vicariously, via documentation systems
and administrative procedures. He thus pioneered the development of the
scientifically organized and professionally managed library, reflecting wider
epistemological and managerial trends towards disciplinarity, bureaucratization
and specialization.
In confronting the question of how the earls of Crawford positioned themselves
within networks of connoisseurship and collecting, I have revealed an evolving
picture in which Lindsay’s relative isolation contrasts markedly with his gregarious
son and grandson. Lindsay espoused the Renaissance paradigm of bibliophilic
generosity. However, he was disengaged from formal and informal networks of
bookish sociability: he eschewed collectors’ clubs, even the aristocratic Roxburghe
Club, and was on close terms with very few individual collectors. As a result of this
251

isolation, the library was little known outside bibliographical circles, and it appears
not to have been extensively consulted by scholars.
I have argued that Lindsay’s cultural capital was sunk into the library, and the
return was realized later by Ludovic and Bal, who were much more closely
integrated into the public and private networks of elite (and predominantly
metropolitan) culture towards the end of the century. This reflects both their
cultured habitus, partly inculcated by the library, and the increasing intrication of
the literary and artistic fields in this period, with greater opportunities for formal
and informal sociability. They realized Lindsay’s ambition of making the library
accessible to a wide circle of friends and associates and, thanks to Ludovic’s
concerted endeavours to publish catalogues of the library, it became more widely
known and consulted than it had been in his father’s time.
Booksellers such as Bernard Quaritch played a pivotal role in the library’s
development, problematizing assumptions over the earls’ principal agency. Despite
their widely disparate social and economic capitals, Lindsay accorded Quaritch
great respect in the bibliographical arena, and their relationship may be
characterized as one of mutual reliance: the bookseller depended upon his client’s
liberal patronage; Lindsay valued Quaritch’s expertise, far-reaching supply networks
and dominance of the auction rooms, and the auxiliary services he provided such as
cataloguing and periodical subscriptions. Ludovic and Bal, by contrast, adopted a
more mercantile approach to collecting and treated dealers merely as suppliers of
books and manuscripts.
Further questions have converged upon the library’s collections of Oriental books
and manuscripts, which were exceptional in their scale and their broad geographic
and cultural compass: what motivated Lindsay and Ludovic to collect these
materials, how did they support Lindsay’s researches into racial classification,
ethnology and comparative religion, and were there any links between these
interests and his concern with social and cultural distinction?
I have demonstrated that Lindsay collected Orientalia in order to fulfil his ambition
to create a panoptical library encompassing all the major civilizations of the postNoachian diaspora, which would support his and others’ researches into ethnology,
252

comparative religion, linguistics and other subjects. He was preoccupied with racial
classification, arguing for the superiority of the Japhetan races, while displaying a
remarkably enlightened attitude towards non-European civilizations. However,
there is no evidence that the manuscripts themselves materially contributed
towards the development of his racial theories, other than affording generalized
impressions of the relative ‘progression’ of various cultures. Ludovic, by contrast,
developed the Oriental collections in new areas, such as Batak materials from
South-East Asia, apparently without any overarching intention or plan; he treated
manuscripts as ‘souvenirs of the exotic’, rather than research resources. In any case,
by the end of the century Orientalist disciplines were coalescing within universities
and specialist institutions, thus marginalizing amateur scholars and collectors.
Lindsay’s interest in racial classification folds back into his concern with social
distinction and class, and in particular his championing of aristocratic hegemony on
grounds of its ‘higher or more generous blood’. He believed that social distinctions
within nations were intrinsically connected to wider racial classifications, while his
aristocratic upbringing and sense of noblesse oblige instilled paternalistic
benevolence towards ‘inferior’ races. These concerns must be contextualized within
wider discourses concerning imperialism, the identity of Britain’s ruling classes, and
the aristocracy’s fitness to lead a modern global empire.

6.2

Contributions to Knowledge and Implications of this Research

This thesis constitutes the first extended application of modern cultural theory to a
manuscript collection, or indeed to any private library, in the nineteenth century.
Cultural theory – especially the Bourdieusian concepts of field, capital and habitus –
has provided the methodological instruments with which to investigate intensively
how the Bibliotheca Lindesiana and the earls of Crawford were situated within
wider social, cultural and epistemological contexts and networks, how the library
and its creators and stakeholders were both affected by and implicated in this
evolving landscape, and how the manuscripts interacted with other aspects of the
library and with these broader forces. The library, and the manuscripts especially,
function as a prism through which are refracted wider issues in Victorian society,
such as the professionalization and complexification of knowledge, the

253

development of library science, the erosion of the aristocracy’s hegemony, and the
ascendancy of a mercantile bourgeoisie.
My research may not lead to a significant revision of existing scholarship in any of
the above fields, still less to a fundamental reconfiguration of the fields themselves.
Nevertheless, this examination of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana has uncovered several
key issues and themes which have previously been unexplored in this or any other
major private library of the nineteenth century.
First, I have demonstrated that the specific and structural reasons for the
construction of the library reside substantially in various forms of classification,
which preoccupied Lindsay and reflected wider societal trends and taxonomies: the
classification of libraries and the organization of knowledge; racial classification and
ethnology; Lindsay’s deployment of the library to reinforce his and his family’s
social and cultural distinction, i.e. social classification; and the earls’ classification of
themselves as collectors, in relation to other bibliophiles. These thickly connected
interests not only warranted and motivated the development of the library; they
were in turn informed and supported by it. The implications of classification – in all
its ramifications – upon a Victorian private library have never previously been
investigated.
Taxonomies and classificatory systems are ideologically charged, and the Library
Report reveals that Lindsay’s interest in library classification was imbricated with
his concerns over social and racial categorization. Lindsay’s classificatory schemes
reflected his elite habitus, confirming Bourdieu’s assertion that judgements of taste
classify the classifier. Furthermore, Lindsay believed that a well-ordered library, far
from operating in an epistemological vacuum, promoted orderliness in society. I
have also shown that his concern with social distinction and class hierarchies was
metonymically associated with racial classifications, the former operating within
nations, the latter between nations.
Lindsay’s concern with classifications instantiates wider contemporaneous anxieties
over ordering, arrangement and categorization. This ‘taxonomania’ – which
Foucault associates with his Classical episteme but which extended through the
nineteenth century – manifested itself in diverse ways; for example, in increasingly
254

complex botanical, zoological and geological taxonomies; Charles Booth’s finegrained analysis of the distribution of poverty in London, and the social
investigations of local statistical societies; physiognomical studies of racial
characteristics; and developments in library classification, such as Dewey’s scheme,
and in museum taxonomies of anthropological artefacts. 1 As these examples
demonstrate, classification and the organization of knowledge were connected with
social ordering and control, and with colonial administration, as Bayly has argued.
Secondly, the library constitutes an important case study of the tensions between
amateur traditions and growing professionalism and sectionalism in the nineteenth
century, both within librarianship and across wider disciplines. Previous
investigations of the professionalization of libraries have focused on the public
library sector; this is the first study of its impact upon private libraries. 2
Lindsay epitomized the gentleman-savant of wide-ranging interests, who was
gradually marginalized as disciplines became institutionalized within the academy;
the roles of gentleman and scholar became increasingly incompatible. Amateur
scholars persisted longest in those fields where wealth brought material advantages;
for example, astronomy, where possession of a private observatory such as Ludovic’s
at Dunecht was a practical advantage as well as a status symbol; and art history, the
field in which Lindsay made his most lasting contributions to knowledge, where an
upbringing surrounded by art objects endowed members of the elite with the
slowly-accumulated cultural capital necessary for connoisseurship. 3 Confounding

his father’s hopes, Ludovic was not a scholar of Lindsay’s calibre: he published little
and appears not to have undertaken sustained research within the library. Instead
he promoted the trend towards greater professionalism by appointing Edmond as
librarian in 1891. However, this distanced him from the quotidian operations of the
library and exposed the tensions inherent in a family library organized along
professional, scientific lines and employing a cohort of staff; ultimately this paradox
became unsustainable in the twentieth century.
Thirdly, the development and eventual dismemberment of the Bibliotheca
Lindesiana exemplify the decline of the aristocracy in the second half of the
nineteenth century and the early decades of the twentieth, and the concomitant rise
of the bourgeoisie. I have shown that Lindsay created the library as a bulwark of
high culture, intended to reinforce his family’s distinction and to prepare them to
assume the mantle of leadership of Britain and its empire. However, by the mid1860s, when he composed the Library Report, he was fighting a rearguard action
and in subsequent decades the combined effects of Parliamentary reform, agrarian
depression and punitive taxation would cripple the landed aristocracy and render
Lindsay’s project redundant. The Lindsay family were largely insulated from the
effects of agricultural decline, but being dependent on the profits of the Wigan Coal
& Iron Company, they were vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the trade cycle.
Financial anxieties largely explain Ludovic’s precipitate decisions to sell the finest
printed books in 1887 and 1889, and the manuscripts in 1901. However, these
disposals can also be interpreted as a pragmatic acknowledgement that his father’s
vision of an aristocratic library that would service the rulers of Britain and its
empire was obsolete.
The rise of the bourgeoisie directly impacted upon the library, as industrialists and
bankers increasingly collected rare books and manuscripts. Lindsay and Ludovic
responded by eschewing the glistering horae that appealed to Frank McClean and
other nouveaux riches. But they were also affected by increasing competition from
American millionaires and European financiers, which drove prices to
unprecedented heights. I have also observed that whereas Lindsay remained aloof
from the sale-rooms, Ludovic and Bal engaged directly in auctions, thereby
demonstrating their autonomy from dealers yet also risking embourgeoisement,
256

contamination with the vulgarity of the trading floor. Thus I have explicated a clear
trajectory in the history of the library, from an aristocratic paradigm epitomized by
Lindsay to a mercantilist one, culminating in the sale of the manuscripts to
Enriqueta Rylands, widow of Manchester’s most successful cotton manufacturer.
While the decline of the aristocracy and dispersal of aristocratic collections is a
familiar trope, this is the first study to contextualize the decline of a private library
within the struggle between the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie. 4

By deploying cultural theory, I have been able to contextualize the library’s
development and decline within the wider socio-cultural landscape, in particular
the displacement of the landed aristocracy towards the turn of the century.
Bourdieusian methodologies have also enabled me to transcend the
subjectivist/objectivist dichotomy between the agency of the earls of Crawford and
the wider environment in which they operated, instead demonstrating how specific
and structural factors interlocked. In adopting this approach, I have significantly
diverged from previous studies of this and other nineteenth-century private
libraries, which have focused on the precise contents of the collections and the lives
of their owners, thereby eliding others’ agency in the libraries’ formation and use,
and deracinating the collections from their socio-cultural and epistemological
contexts. I have thus responded to the calls of Potten and Purcell to re-evaluate
private libraries as social spaces, to examine their social and cultural functions, and
to position them within an epistemological landscape. 5 My work complements
Towsey’s more expansive enquiries into reading practices and sociability within
Scottish provincial libraries. 6 However, by interrogating several aspects of a single
library, I have been able to contextualize the library’s social functions against other

issues such as its intellectual organization and topography, the expansion of the
collections, the socio-economic status of its owners and their social networks.
I therefore suggest that the methodologies I have adopted to study the Bibliotheca
Lindesiana, and its manuscript components in particular, may encourage others to
undertake similar investigations of private libraries, large and small. This will
enable informed comparisons to be made between collections, and trends to be
delineated in the evolution of private libraries in the nineteenth century,
positioning them within the wider issues of the socio-cultural transformation of
Britain and the growth of empire, instead of treating collections in isolation. I have
shown that the Bibliotheca Lindesiana can function as a lens through which to view
various aspects of Victorian culture; it serves as a case study of how these large
forces played out in one family’s library, albeit an exceptional one. It therefore
demonstrates the potential for deploying private libraries to illuminate issues
beyond the confines of bibliography and book history.
A further benefit of this cultural-theory approach will be to encourage the field of
manuscript and bibliographical studies to slough off its fusty antiquarian and
connoisseurial reputation and to accrue greater credibility within the academy, just
as museology has been transformed by the infusion of postcolonial, feminist and
cultural theories. 7 Manuscript studies urgently require similar revitalization.
This research also has profound implications for me as a curator-researcher. I have
acquired a much deeper understanding of the formation and development of the
Bibliotheca Lindesiana, and of its manuscripts especially, thereby informing my
professional curation of these collections and my support for other researchers
studying them. Undertaking a PhD has both enhanced my appreciation of

researchers’ mentalités and methodologies – thus aiding my role within an
academic library – and assisted me to develop a more acute research sensibility of
my own, broadening my intellectual horizons to encompass nineteenth-century
cultural and intellectual history. When I entered the archives profession thirty years
ago, I was warned that the roles of archivist and researcher were incompatible and
that I should forsake the latter. I have demonstrated that they are, in fact,
complementary and I am determined to remain research-active following the
completion of this PhD. In positioning myself on the threshold of the academy, I
have differentiated myself from the traditional bibliographical approaches
exemplified by the Roxburghe Club. My own journey therefore faintly echoes the
nineteenth-century debates around the standing of gentlemen-scholars, like
Lindsay, and the rise of the academy, which I outlined earlier.

6.3

Areas for Future Research

In order to conform to the requirements of a modern doctoral thesis, important
aspects of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana and its context have necessarily been excluded
from this study. I have briefly considered the economic underpinnings of the library
– the family’s income from the Wigan Coal and Iron Company – but further work is
required to analyse the potential correlation between the earls’ income and their
expenditure on the library.
I have also omitted any analysis of Lindsay’s art collecting, although it was scarcely
less important than his collecting of books and manuscripts. His complex ‘General
Classification of Schools and Artists’, in Sketches of the History of Christian Art, was
another significant manifestation of his ‘taxonomania’. 8 While Brigstocke has
previously elucidated Lindsay’s art-collecting practices, I believe that there is scope
for re-evaluating this aspect of his career in conjunction with his bibliographical
interests. Moreover, the profound influence that Christian beliefs and traditions had
upon the development of the library warrants further exploration.
I am also conscious that this study has focused predominantly upon Lindsay’s
contributions to the library and his concerns with classification and distinction, and

8

259

that Ludovic may therefore appear as a secondary figure, standing in his father’s
shadow. Of course, Ludovic has not left us the equivalent of the Library Report
which provides such rich evidence of his father’s philosophy of collecting; his
motives and opinions are therefore more opaque. However, his collecting career
reflected contemporary issues such as renewed interest in Egyptology and papyri.
Other aspects of his collecting, such as French revolutionary material, autograph
letters and proclamations, merit further investigation. Towards the end of his life,
Ludovic developed a passion for philately, creating one of the finest stamp
collections in the world. 9 Classification is intrinsic to the hobby, and it was perhaps
here that ‘taxonomania’ manifested itself most in Ludovic’s career: he not only
acquired three great groups of stamps, but arranged them ‘with astonishing skill
and diligence’, according to his son. 10
Ludovic was an enthusiastic photographer too, undertaking an ambitious project to
photograph jewelled and metal bindings across Europe. 11 While he did not cease to
acquire such items himself, in switching his focus from purchasing originals to
obtaining copies he was conforming to Benjamin’s thesis that the aura of an artwork
diminishes in the ‘age of mechanical reproduction’. 12 The infinite reproducibility of
photography also collapsed the imperative to collect comprehensively; Ludovic was
perhaps conscious that mechanical reproduction nullified his father’s ambition to
build a universal library.
In view of these limitations, I propose to undertake three further research projects.
First, I hope to publish a scholarly edition of the Library Report, the introduction to
which is reproduced in Appendix 1; this important document remains largely
unknown and deserves a much wider audience. Secondly, I wish to expand this
thesis into a monograph-length study of the Bibliotheca Lindesiana, addressing

some of the omissions outlined above. It will include more detailed treatment of the
economic aspects of the library; an analysis of Lindsay’s application of classification
to art history and comparisons between his collecting of art and his acquisitions of
books and manuscripts; more intensive study of Ludovic’s contributions to the
library and his interests in photography, documentary material and philately; and,
lastly, a discussion of the sale of the manuscripts to Enriqueta Rylands in 1901,
which was the culmination of some of the key trends that I have identified in the
history of the library. I also intend to contextualize the Bibliotheca Lindesiana
through fuller comparative studies of other collectors, including such neglected
figures as Bragge, Brooke, McClean and Tyssen-Amherst.
This could lead to a third, longer-term project: a major study of manuscript
collecting in the nineteenth century. As noted in Chapter 1, the most recent
monograph-length survey, Munby’s Connoisseurs, was published forty-five years
ago and, notwithstanding Hindman and Rowe’s subsequent examination of the
collecting and cultural reception of manuscript illuminations in the long nineteenth
century, a re-evaluation is long overdue. This study would amplify some of the
themes addressed in my thesis, examining the cultural and epistemological
functions of manuscripts in the period, formal and informal networks of collectors,
and comparisons between the collecting of manuscripts, rare books and artworks.
The phenomenon of manuscript collecting in the nineteenth century warrants a
major reassessment to expose its full socio-cultural ramifications.

Appendix 1: Transcription of Lord Lindsay’s Extended Letter to his Son
Ludovic, Introducing the Library Report, February 1865
Editorial Introduction
While residing at the Villa Caprini in Florence, in February 1865, Lindsay composed
a 12,000-word introduction to the Library Report, in the form of a letter addressed
to his son Ludovic. The letter is a crucial piece of evidence for the present thesis,
constituting a detailed explication and justification of Lindsay’s collecting principles
and practices and averring the ennobling influence that possession of a choice and
well-ordered library confers upon a family. The previously unpublished letter
therefore merits transcription in full.
I have endeavoured to transcribe the introduction to the Library Report faithfully,
exactly as Lindsay composed it. However, it is impossible adequately to represent
the rich semiosis of a fluid hand-written text through the typographic rigidity of the
printed page. Meaning is always lost or distorted in the editorial process. In this
case, I decided to transcribe all the text, amendments, insertions and notes made in
ink, including Ludovic’s later interventions, but largely to omit Lindsay’s numerous
pencilled annotations (which were written in his minute, spidery drafting hand,
heavily abbreviated and almost illegible), except where they appeared to me to be
particularly significant.
The following editorial conventions have been employed in the transcription.
Additional text. Lindsay made frequent alterations and additions to the text, ranging
from the amendment of a single word to the addition of entire paragraphs. Minor
alterations were effected by writing over the original wording. Several words might
be inserted in interlinear fashion, while more extensive additions were generally
inserted in the generous left-hand margin of the page, usually with an insertion
mark and line to indicate the point in the original text to which the addition relates.

310

Additional text is here enclosed within a pair of caret symbols, ^…^. Marginal
insertions are indicated thus: ‘[marginal insertion: …]’.
Deleted text. Likewise, numerous single words, phrases, lines and longer passages
were deleted, either in the initial process of composition, or during subsequent
revision. Lindsay’s normal practice was to strike out text with a single horizontal
line at mid-height, and in most cases the deleted text remains reasonably legible.
Deleted text is here signified by using the ‘strikethrough’ format. Where the text is
no longer readable, this is indicated with an editorial comment, e.g. ‘[single word
struck though, illegible]’.
Underlined text. Single and double underlining is shown exactly as it appears in the
original text.
Punctuation. Lindsay used various marks of punctuation including the full point,
semi-colon and comma. One of his favourite punctuation devices was the
combination of a comma and en-dash (‘, – ’), which is approximately equivalent to a
semi-colon. Lindsay generally adopted the modern American practice of applying
end quotation-marks after any other punctuation mark such as a comma or full
point, rather than before, e.g. ‘Balcarres Papers,’. In some instances, however, it is
not obvious whether the quotation-mark precedes or follows the comma or point.
Therefore, I have transcribed all quotation-marks as following other punctuation,
except in those cases where they unequivocally precede it. Occasionally Lindsay
accidentally omitted end quotation-marks; I have noted such cases.
Footnotes. Lindsay’s normal practice was to place footnotes at the bottom of the
page to which they refer, separated from the main text by a single horizontal line.
He employed the traditional footnote symbols.
Accented characters. Lindsay was inconsistent in his treatment of accented
characters: sometimes he omitted the accent; sometimes he used an acute accent
when a grave was required, (‘é’ instead of ‘è’, for example), and vice versa; and on
occasion he wrote the accent in an ambiguous or careless manner, making precise
transcription difficult. Generally, I have endeavoured to follow Lindsay’s original

311

practice, except in cases of ambiguity where normal modern usage has been
followed.
Ellipses. Lindsay often used a double point ‘..’ to indicate an ellipsis. For the
avoidance of doubt, these have been replaced with a standard three-point ellipsis
‘…’.
The twenty-ninth earl of Crawford retains possession of the Library Report at
Balcarres House and holds copyright in it. I am profoundly grateful to him for
permitting me to photograph and transcribe the Report.

Transcription
[p. 1]
My dear Ludovic,
My present discourse is to be upon Books – a theme you have of late lent from time
to time a patient ear to, – upon Books as constituting a Library, and upon the
Library in particular which in the course of years you will inherit, and will view, I
hope, in the light of a trust, to be transmitted, unimpaired, and perhaps in
augmented value, to posterity. I now offer you a ‘Report upon the Present State and
Future Prospects of the Crawford and Balcarres,’ or, what I please myself sometimes
in calling the Lindesian (perhaps too presumptuously) the ‘Lindesian Library.’
Books are ^represent^ the better part, the quintessence, the immortal utterance of
the loftiest minds of the past, lingering and voiceful among men to the latest
generations. It was this belief and conviction and belief which animated the
Ptolemies and the Attaluses, the Luculluses and Trajans, of Classic times – the
^Abdul Hakim II King of Cordova in 963.^ and ^Sahib ib Alud Vizir of Persia about
1000.^, collectors of the great Saracenic libraries of the middle ages – the Tai-tsous
and Khien-loungs of distant China, and the De Thous and Colberts, the Medici and
Barberini, the De Thotts and Van Hulthems, the Sczechenys, Telekis and Zaluskis,
the Bodleys, Harleys, Grenvilles, and Spencers, of ^modern^ Western Europe, in
amassing the magnificent Libraries which have immortalised their memory. It is a
312

conviction and belief common to the mind and heart of man under all climes and in
ages. I have not a doubt but that the ships of Tarshish which brought to Solomon
the treasures of the East were charged specially to bring him books and manuscripts
from the sages of India and Iran, as well as the gold, and silver, and ivory which
were to adorn his palaces, and the apes and peacocks destined for his gardens and
menageries. The King who spoke ^uttered^ “three thousand proverbs” and sang
songs “a thousand and five” – who “spake of trees from the cedar-tree that is in
Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall,” as “also of beasts and
of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes,” like an Oriental Aristotle – who
“passed all the kings of the earth” in riches and knowledge – whose “wisdom
excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East country, and all the wisdom of
Egypt” – and to whom God gave that diviner gift, “largeness of heart even as the
sand that is on the sea shore,” – this sage of sages, this ἀναξ ἀνδρων, to whom the
Kings of Arabia and Queens of Sheba brought offerings of whatever
[p. 2]
they thought most precious and acceptable – must have had a library – must I had
almost said, have been a ^B^bibliomaniac. Would that Solomon’s library could be
recovered from the past, even as the wisdom ^literature^ of Assyria is even now
being deciphered from the clay tablets of the library of Sardanapalus at Nineveh! —
I have stood with suppressed breath and beating heart within the walls of [marginal
insertion: which once enshrined] a Library earlier than any of these, the ‘Chamber of
Thoth’ in the Memnonium at Thebes, built by Rameses the Great fourteen hundred
years before ^the advent of^ Our Saviour.*
It were waste of time to expatiate on a fact so self-evident as the benefit conferred
on the human race at large, not only by the collectors of great Libraries, such as
those above mentioned, but also (I may add) by the bibliographers who have made
such collections their study, and thus furnished the key wherewith to unlock the
treasures they contained. What may be less open to observation is the fact (which
grows ever more and more on my own apprehension) that a choice and well
ordered ^private^ Library exercises a most ennobling influence upon the family
which possesses it, and through such families upon society. The like may be said of
313

pictures and works of art – indeed of any intellectual heritage, duly prized, – for it is
seldom indeed that the mere possession of [marginal insertion: and consequent
daily familiarity with] such treasures fails to induce an intellectual interest in them,
and, through that interest, an elevation and refinement of sentiment and character
in the successive generations of the family thus distinguished. And as the great
families of a nation – those that give it a history – do not rise and fall, generation
after generation, like ripples of the sea, leaving no trace behind, but are each (as it
were) immortal ^perennial^, rushing ever onward and pervading society like a
flowing and Nile-like tide till the source that supplies their fount of being becomes
exhausted; so it is easy to conceive of the extent and effect of that continuous
stream of influence, (thus fed by the past and nourished in reverence for the great
minds of yore), on the living world of which such families form a part, and which to
a certain ^so great an^ extent reflects their light and image. It is for this reason that,
while public libraries are the glory of nations and blessings to humanity, private
libraries are, I venture to think, of equal value in the great account – provided only
that a large and liberal heart^s^ presides over their ^collection^ custody, and
communication.
* I cannot give up this “fond imagination” of Solomon’s library. It is true that the sacred
records speak not of such a collection; but to the Hebrew the books of foreign lands would
have been an abomination. My impression is that if Solomon’s Egyptian father-in-law, or his
Phœnician friend Hiram, could be evoked from the dead and questioned on the subject,
they would tell us wondrous tales concerning it. The decisive dictum, so consolatory to the
dunce, that “of making many books there is no end,” and that “much study is a weariness to
the flesh,” appears to me, almost of itself, to prove my position. The statement, I need
hardly observe, is but a bold paranomasia introductory to the climax with which the
Preacher winds up his immortal homily.

[p. 3]
Intentionally or instinctively our own house have always acted upon the conviction
and the principle I have just attempted to express and vindicate. The Library now in
question has been in existence – from small beginnings, now expanding, now
contracting in extent and value, and with the usual ups and downs, breaks and

314

cataracts attendant upon all such collections – for nearly three hundred years –
ever, in a word, since the restoration of letters in Scotland.
It was founded ^commenced^ during the latter years of the sixteenth Century by
the first of the Balcarres branch of the Crawford family, John Lindsay of Balcarres,
Lord Menmuir, Lord Privy Seal and Secretary of State to James VI. – the second son
of David ninth Earl of Crawford. Lord Menmuir had received his education ^as
well^ in France and England, ^as in Scotland^ was a learned and accomplished
man, skilled in Latin composition in verse and prose, and a profound and far-seeing
statesman, the originator of many great measures which affected the destinies of
Scotland, and indirectly those of Great Britain, for generations afterwards; and these
varied yet kindred qualities must have been in the remembrance of a contemporary
historian when he chronicled his early death as that of “a man of exquisite learning
and of the greatest natural wit joined with that,” “the greatest light of the hail
policie of Scotland.” It was not, however, books – although he had a fair collection
of them – so much as historical manuscripts, especially the correspondence of the
statesmen, warriors, sovereigns, and royal families of France and Scotland during
the age immediately anterior to his own, that Lord Menmuir interested himself in
collecting. These, or such of them as had been preserved [marginal insertion: by his
descendants] through the civil wars, were presented by his great-grandson (along
with other historical papers of later date) to the [marginal insertion: Library of the
Faculty of] Advocates’ Library, in Edinburgh, in 1712, and are now bound up in
several ^seven^ folio volumes entitled the ‘Balcarres Papers,’ – a series of no great
extent indeed, as compared with many such accumulations, but of which it might
be said (as respects Lord Menmuir’s part of the collection) that, like the fringes of
Minerva’s aegis, each separate leaf is worth a hecatomb, so precious are the letters
and so celebrated the correspondents that figure therein. Of Lord Menmuir’s library
proper but few of the volumes survive to us – the Plato of Serranus being the most
interesting of them.
The founder of the Balcarres collection was, in fact, ^strictly speaking,^ Lord
Menmuir’s son, David, the first Lord ^Lindsay of^ Balcarres – a man resembling
^similar to^ his father in learning and application, but who preferred the society of
his books to that of camps and courts, and abjured a life of ambition for the quest of
315

wisdom in retreat. “He thought that day misspent,” says his daughter-in-law Anne
of Seaforth, speaking of his library – “on which he knew not ^some^ thing new.”
Such men [marginal insertion: isolated as they stand among those of their own rank
and position] are not without their use ^– in one point of view,^ as originators of
ideas which inform future generations – and as ^in another, ambassadors of
intellect,^ representatives during their own time in one class of life of the
characteristics belonging to another, and thus serving [marginal insertion:
contributing as by a diplomatic intervention] to reconcile and harmonise society. If
poets, painters, philosophers, and men of science formed distinct classes which
never intermingled, we should be reduced to the condition of the castes of Egypt;
but a Byron among peers, your uncle Coutts among soldiers, a Marcus Antoninus
among emperors, a Bacon among lawyers – even, I will
[p. 4]
add, a Jacob Böhm among shoemakers – have a special value in the point of view
thus suggested, independently altogether of their positive rank as men of genius –
among whom I do not pretend to class our ancestor Lord Balcarres. It is as a bookcollector that we are now dealing with him. I have printed in the ‘Lives of the
Lindsays’ a letter from Sir John Scott, of Scotstarvet, the author of the ‘Staggering
State of Scots Statesmen,’ in which Sir John applies to him for various works of the
Scottish poets, existing in the Balcarres Library in manuscript, which he was
anxious to print in the ‘Deliciæ Poetarum Scotorum,’ (and which were duly sent
him as by a marginal memorandum, “with divers others”) – and another from the
poet Drummond of Hawthornden, the friend of ^‘rare^ Ben Jonson’ [marginal
insertion: Date July 26, 1623.] (and who has recorded so many of Jonson’s
recollections of Shakespeare), [‘(and… Shakespeare)’ struck through in pencil] in
which Drummond thanks him for the sight of his library during a recent visit to
Fife, and pleads the excellence of the collection and Lord Balcarres’s “good
intelligence abroad” in apology for his sending for his acceptance a new and
privately printed volume of his own, “not as yet to be found in any library,” and
which he has therefore no fear would be found superfluous as a duplicate, – to wit,
the ‘Flowers of Zion,’ which we thus learn was first issued in this restricted manner,

316

“for a few friends, of whom God knows” (he says) I have not many, whereof I have
always accounted yourself one.”
[Written on a slip pasted into the margin alongside the above paragraph: I have been
bold to present you with this of mine… onlye singular in this, that it is not to be
found in any library I having caused print only^e^ some copies equaling the
number of my friends and those to whom I am beholden, which are not the World
knows many among which I have ever esteemed and found you.]
Lord Balcarres’s correspondence with his brother-in-law the good and
accomplished John Earl of Lauderdale abounds with classical allusion, but the
studies of his predilection were scientific – in astronomy, mathematics, and
chemistry – with a strong bias, as of a Rosicrucian, towards the occult walks of
alchemy. He collected all the books accounted valuable in these branches of
science, and in numerous cases, when very rare and not to be purchased,
transcribed them with his own hand. Many of his books bear the indication in his
handwriting of having been bought out of Scotland ^abroad^, while on visits to
France and England. He was curious, like many other collectors, in ^book-^binding,
and had his arms, surrounded with the inscription ‘David Dominus Lyndesay de
Balcarres,’ stamped on the larger volumes, and his crest, a pavilion ^azure,^ semée
of stars, ^or^ with the motto ‘Astra Castra,’ on the smaller. A few leaves of the
Library Catalogue, written in Lord Balcarres’s own hand, have been preserved
among our family papers. Robert Lindsay, a ^his^ younger brother of Lord
Balcarres, had also a small library, and, dying without children, his collection
merged in that at Balcarres, ^and of these too some volumes survive to us.^
Fife ^The ‘Kingdom of Fife’,^ during the latter years of the sixteenth and the first
half of the seventeenth century, was a sort of sanctuary of the Muses in Scotland,
partly through the ^its^ neighbourhood to the capital, but more especially through
the ^its^ isolated position as a peninsula, and through there being few or none of
the greater [marginal insertion: more powerful] feudal barons resident there, at least
in the Eastern portion of the county. While David Lord Balcarres and his father
Lord Menmuir “cultivated literature” on the “little oatmeal” of their Fifeshire acres,

317

the chiefs of the family in Forfarshire were occupied in continual private warfare
with hereditary
[p. 5]
and personal enemies.
Lord Balcarres’s successor was Alexander, created Earl of Balcarres by Charles II. on
the occasion of his coronation in Scotland in 1651. Long before this, and before the
outbreak of the civil wars, he was in frequent correspondence with his cousingerman Lord Maitland, afterwards the celebrated and oppressive Duke of
Lauderdale, on matters touching their books and libraries. After a brief and active
life spent between the tented field and the council-chamber of his exiled sovereign,
where he held the post of Secretary of State for Scotland, he died at the early age of
forty-one, worn out with the effects of exposure on the Highland hills, and with
anxiety and sorrow. “His delight was in his books,” as by the testimony of his
biographer; but he had not the opportunity of adding many to the Library, his
difficulty latterly having been to find bread for his wife and children to eat while in
exile after the sequestration of his estates by Cromwell, and in the foreign land
where he died. His learning is celebrated by his contemporaries especially [two
words struck through] Richard Baxter, the author of the ‘Saint’s Rest,’ “none being
praised equally with him” (he writes) “for learning and judgment in all Scotland;”
and Cowley says of him, in an elegy to his memory,
“His wisdom, and his lady too,
“Were things celestial.”
[Written on a slip pasted onto the facing page intended to replace the first line of the
following paragraph: At one moment in Earl Alexanders life, there was great risk of
risk of the Library being dispersed. His wife had given her personal personal
ornaments, “her woving furniture”, as a contribution to their common necessity, &
Lord Balcarres executed a Codicil to his Will bequeathing to her the Library, which
he had previously made an heirloom, fixing its redeemable value at 6000 Scottish

318

marks. She probably never claimed it, and the Library like a bark weathering the
storm emerged pretty safely from…]
The Library at Balcarres seems to have escaped pretty safely from the deluge of rain
which overwhelmed most of the old houses of Scotland during the Great Rebellion.
Lord ^The Duke of^ Lauderdale’s family papers were less fortunate, – they had been
buried in chests in the court-yard of Balcarres, and were found on being dug up at
the Restoration to have been almost entirely destroyed by damp; but such was the
reputation which the preceding Lord Lauderdale, David Lord Balcarres’s brother-inlaw and the Duke’s father had borne for accuracy and integrity that an inventory of
them drawn up in his handwriting was declared by Act of Parliament sufficient to
replace them ^Supply their Deficiencies^ in matters of law and property. The Duke
of Lauderdale, I may add, Earl Alexander’s early friend and correspondent, long
survived him, and collected a very fine library, which was after his death sold in
London, in several portions, between the years 16

and 16

. The sale-catalogues of

this library are among the rarest existing, and are still desiderata to our own
collection of such records.
Earl Colin, the son of Alexander, and who succeeded an elder brother who died a
child, received through the care of his mother – Anne of Seaforth, an anxious
trustee of his father’s wishes – the foundation of an excellent education; and
although his career was that of activity and public life as a soldier and statesman
during the reigns of Charles II. and James II., and his character exhibited a full
sufficiency of the buoyant gaiety popularly attributed to the ‘lightsome Lindsays,’ he
still merited the character given of him by Mr. Chambers of the “learned” as well as
the “elegant Balcarres.” His mother, in a letter of advice to him on entering life, of
which I have quoted some passages in the ‘Lives,’ speaks of his “closet” or library in
a manner indicating that it still contained stores for the mind whether in the way of
improvement or recreation; and on a later occasion, when he had incurred the
displeasure of Charles by a marriage contrary to the royal wishes, he spent six years
in retirement at Balcarres and study
[p. 6]

319

at Balcarres, seeking, as his tells us, to repair the deficiencies of an education too
early interrupted, – years which he often afterwards told that son were “the happiest
time of his life whole life.” It was in this “closet” or library, moreover, that long
afterwards, – the Revolution of 1688 and ^eight^ years of exile having intervened –
^&^ after joining in the unsuccessful insurrection of 1715, and receiving a pardon
through the interest of his friend Churchill, Duke of Marlborough – he ^Earl Colin^
finished his days, an aged man, in 1722, – passing a second period of six, or nearer
seven years, in that same retreat, in his nightgown and slippers – a dress of ease and
lettered indolence which his granddaughter tells us ^perhaps with some
exaggeration^ he never, after this last return home, laid aside. It was while
concerting with his friend the Earl of Mar the insurrection of 1715, and in
apprehension possibly of the effects of confiscation and devastation in case the
revolt should be unsuccessful, that Earl Colin presented, as I previously mentioned,
the series of autograph correspondence collected by his ancestor Lord Menmuir,
together with other papers of public interest, many of which related to the defence
of the Highlands against Cromwell under his father ^and the Earl of^ Glencairn in
1653, to the Library of the Faculty of Advocates, in Edinburgh, in 1712. The learned
antiquary Sir Robert Sibbald in his ‘History of Fife,’ published in 16

, speaks, in

describing Balcarres, of Earl Colin’s great plantations and of his “great Bibliotheck”
in terms of admiration.
The life of Earl Colin’s eldest son and successor, Alexander ^fourth^ Earl of
Balcarres, was that of a soldier fighting in the campaigns of Marlborough in
company with Corporal Trim and my uncle Toby; and, although a gallant and
chivalric gentleman, I should not think he added a volume to the family collection.
But his younger brother and heir Earl James, who succeeded him – your great-greatgrandfather – was a great reader ^and an accomplished,^ although not a learned
man, having entered the navy when a mere boy. He was fortunate however in the
Captain under whom he served, who took a paternal interest in him for several
years, encouraging and guiding his studies so far as they could be pursued on
shipboard and elsewhere; and ^thus^ filling the young sailor’s heart with a fervent
gratitude ^to his memory^ which years and experience only served to intensify. The
result was fortunate. During a long service – till 1715 as a sailor, till Dettingen and
320

Fontenoy ^in 1743 & 1745^ as a soldier – he ^Earl James^ passed much of his leisure
hours, I cannot say in the old Library, for he was seldom at home; but in the
company of the wise and learned, a chosen few, “whose published thoughts have
benefited mankind,” – he cultivated the friendship of such men as Bolingbroke in
his youth and Hume in his old age; and during those latter years, and especially
after he had become afflicted with the infirmity of deafness, “books,” says his
daughter, Lady Anne Barnard, “were,” next to the society of his contemplation
^society^ of his children and his genealogical studies, “his constant resource” and
comfort. I cannot describe him as a collector; but he amply appreciated the stores
laid up by his father and other predecessors. His favourite author was Montaigne, –
and his humour, of which many traditions are still current in Fife, was somewhat
akin to that of the quaint but chivalrous Gascon.
After Earl James’s death (in 1768), and during the minority of his son, his widow,
with her eleven children, lived for many years in retirement at Balcarres; and Lady
Anne Barnard has des[p. 7 ]
cribed in her Memoirs the early ventures of herself and her sister Lady Margaret –
wandering at will through the sea of books in the old Library, without rudder and
without pilot – books “whose learned dust,” she says, “had made philosophers and
chemists of all the moths in the castle.” But the hour was at hand which was to
make ^witness^ a rude disturbance in these ancient precincts, – not indeed
absolutely to annihilate the Library, but to reduce it to the lowest point of
attenuation, short of absolutely breaking its continuity. Lord Balcarres, my
Grandfather, although a man of broad views and wise counsel, and a terse and
powerful writer, was not a learned man or a student; – his early entry into the army
at the age of sixteen, and a life of constant and active military duty in the American
war and, afterwards, as Governor of Jersey and Jamaica during the wars of the
French Revolution, left little time for literary pursuits. Some, however, of the works
on military science of the days of ‘Henri Quatre’ and the Fronde had attracted his
attention in the Balcarres Library, and these he took with him to Jersey, whence
(having been left behind there) they were sent to my father as a present ^their
321

rightful owner^ many years afterwards. But Few ^however^, I apprehend, after Earl
James’s death – or, at least, after the youthful and bright sunbeam of Lady Anne’s
and Lady Margaret’s presence had vanished from the scene – disturbed “the ancient
solitary reign” of the moths and spiders in Lord David’s sanctuary under the old
crow-trees at Balcarres; and, I grieve to say ^confess^ it, on my grandmother Lady
Balcarres leaving Fife and settling in Edinburgh for the education of her children
while her husband was in the West Indies, the greater portion of the library was
literally thrown away and dispersed – torn up, I believe, for grocers, as useless trash,
by her orders or by her permission, – the accumulation[?] ^inheritance^ of
generations thus going down to the dust, under a Pharaoh that knew not Joseph, in
dishonour. The late Lord Hardwicke, my great-uncle, ^by marriage^ who was a
judge of such matters, told my father that it was one of the most curious old
libraries he ever saw, and ^he^ deeply regretted its destruction. A few volumes
^indeed^ escaped the fate of their brethren and found their way to Haigh; others,
distinguished by family signatures, and the arms or crest stamped on the sides, have
been presented to me, or I have picked them up at different times when offered for
sale. The continuity of the collection has never (as I said) been absolutely broken,
but the shock ^it then sustained^, it cannot be denied, was a rude one.
During these many generations, which have come ^coming^ like shadows and so
departed^ing^ across the scene of our ancient Library, all the Earls ^Lords^ of
Balcarres, with one exception, were men of enterprise ^the world (in the best sense
of the term)^ as well as of letters; they combined ^united^, as you have seen, the
active with a fair share of the contemplative and studious life; and this happy
combination I believe to have been the consequence in great measure of their
library, as it was undoubtedly a secret cause of the love they attracted, I had almost
said, the fascination they exercised upon their contemporaries, and of which the
tradition has descended to modern times. Learning in them was ^and
accomplishment was in them^ no let to patriotism, no plea against grace and
elegance. The exception I have spoken of was that of David Lord Balcarres [marginal
insertion: although even he threw off his toga for the cuirasse & broadsword when
the civil wars broke out], – it is the example of his father and of his successors that I
would recommend to your admiration and emulation.
322

Let me add here that, after the removal of our immediate family to Haigh, and the
arrangements by which my great-uncle and your maternal great-grandfather, Mr
Robert Lindsay ^of Leuchars^
[p. 8]
became the Laird, or in old Scottish parlance, Baron of Balcarres, a new library,
[three words struck through, illegible] ^in emulation^ of the old one, speedily took
root within the old precincts, and under the fosterage of your grandfather General
Lindsay and your grandmother became a most charming and graceful collection of
everything best and most delightful in every English, French, German, and Italian
literature. This, it will probably ^library I presume, it will^ be your uncle Sir
Coutts’s, pleasure and your aunt Blanche’s pleasure in after times to amplify – in the
direction probably of Art and the Belles Lettres, the scene ^field^ of his own
mastery, just as I expect that the department of astronomy, ^of music^ and perhaps
others in the realm of science in our own Library may become the object of your
own especial protection and predilection.
It was by the same Lord Balcarres during whose absence from Europe the
catastrophe above spoken of took place – your (paternal) great-grandfather – that, I
am happy to say, the first step was taken, about twenty years afterwards, towards
the reparation of this misfortune, and the resuscitation of the library of his
ancestors. On the death of John Lord Muncaster (whose only surviving child had
married my father), Lord Balcarres, by ^at^ my father’s advice ^instance^,
purchased the Muncaster library, a collection of about five thousand ? volumes –
which contained many good and useful books in all classes of literature, although
few volumes of rarity (unless imperfect) or of high pecuniary value. This, therefore,
with the remnant of the old Balcarres library, and a small collection bequeathed to
myself by Lady Mary Lindsay Crawford, sister and heiress of George twenty-second
Earl of Crawford, (and which had been the library of the usurping line of the
Lindsays of the Byres, Earls of Crawford and Lindsay since our own ^the^ elder
branch was dispossessed during the Civil Wars), – these three collections – the first
of the greater extent, the second little more then than a “magni nominis umbra” –
and the third interesting to me chiefly from the source from whence it came –
323

formed the basis or platform I had myself to start from as a collector – in the
endeavour to build up once more, and on a larger scale, the “great Bibliotheck”
recorded by Sir Robert Sibbald.

I had, in fact, in my earliest^y^ youth determined to gather ^assemble^ together
the wisest and best authors ^most graceful thinkers^ of all countries, ages, and
pursuits, as agreeable companions, instructive teachers, and honoured guests,
under the symbolic pavilion of the Lindsays, who, with their friends, might thus
converse hereafter, as in the School of Athens, with congenial associates in
whatever branches of literature, art, or science, their genius or taste should severally
direct them to, – in other words, I proposed to myself as an object the development
of our library into one worthy of our family – not a mere bibliomaniacal congeries of
undigested accumulation, but a library of intrinsic excellence, to contain the most
useful and interesting books, old and new, in all walks of literature – although
including the chief bibliographical treasures which lend grace and value to such
collections. I gradually extended my view to the collection of pictures and works of
art of every description, few but choice, with the object of forming and fostering
useful and graceful tastes among the successive generations of our house, – I have
done something in this latter direction, having had an excellent foundation to
[p. 9]
work upon in the collection of pictures inherited from our ancestors, from y my
grandfather and from my great-aunt Lady Anne Barnard. But I shall expiate on this
matter in a distinct Report, – my present subject is the Library.
I began collecting in a small way in 1826, shortly after going to Eton, and at the
same time endeavoured to prepare myself for the work of future years by the study
of the science of Bibliography in such books as I could afford to buy or could get
access to. [marginal insertion: Dr Clarke’s Bibliographical Dictionary was my
constant companion] Dibdin’s writings, in particular, made me for the time a
thorough bibliomaniac. I met him ^Dr Dibdin^ once at a friend’s house, and
although he discoursed on matters very foreign to the subject of libraries [marginal
324

insertion: it was at the time of the Reform Bill of 1832, & he was a Rabid Radical], I
remember the sight I had of him with pleasure. I had distant glimpses of other
collectors, and frequent opportunities of gazing on books of beauty and value, in
the great room of Messrs Payne and Foss in Pall Mall, a literary Rialto, where the
Spencers, Hebers, and Grenvilles of the day were wont to congregate, and where,
while collating, in particular, by permission of those courteous Messrs Payne & Foss
those courteous bibliopoles, the poems of Simonides, which it was my ambition to
edit, in the Anthologia of 1495, I watched them from the corner come and go, like
ghosts and phantoms, who might have noticed me had I taken the initiative and
ventured to speak to them. I also at this time, in 1826 and 1827, frequented the saleroom at Christie’s ^Evans^, especially when the rich libraries of Mr. Dent and ^the
Revd^ Theodore Williams were dispersed – watching the biddings and entering the
prices on the margin of my Catalogue. But, although I occasionally bought a classic
from Messrs Payne and Foss (whose kind allowance of me was quite independent of
interest), my purchases at this time were for the most part confined to the cheaper
second-hand shops of Holborn. I collected in this way as many books (chiefly
classical and philological) as sufficed to cover ^an entire^ wall of my room at Eton;
and among them were a few volumes not unworthy to hold their place even in our
present library. I pursued the same course, and acquired a few ^various^ choice
books in the ‘Quartier Latin’ and elsewhere at Paris, and in Italy ^when travelling
there with my tutor^, in 1828, 1829, and 1830.
I could do but little, however, towards my object – having nothing but a schoolboy’s
and collegian’s allowance – till the year 1834, when the bequest above alluded to
from ^kindness of the^ Lady Mary Lindsay Crawford ^above alluded to^, who left[?]
made me her residuary legatee and put thereby a large sum of money at my
disposal, enabled me to make a proper commencement. Being still under the
influence of the Bibliomania and conscious of the fact – and much impressed too
with the ruinous effects of it as exemplified in the case of Mr Theodore Williams
and others, I determined, from a sense of self-distrust, to confine myself rigidly in
the first instance to the acquisition of the more useful and substantial backbones of
a library – only purchasing such of the rarer books as should be absolutely essential
to its completeness. The sale of Mr. Heber’s collection was then going on, and a few
325

of his books which I obtained at that time, chiefly works of history, such as
Castanheda’s history of the Portuguese conquests in India, Brito’s ‘Monarquia
Lusitana,’ Baldensel’s Pilgrimage to Palestine, Schildtberger’s travels in Tartary, and
^not a few^ others, I have never seen in the market since. Other rare books, less
immediately important to my scheme, I let go in pursuance of the
[p. 10]
resolution above mentioned, expecting to have later opportunities of acquiring
them, – many of these works have never since presented themselves – some have
occurred for the first time during the last six or seven years, and these, with few
exceptions, I have secured. I believe now that for the interest of the Library I was
wrong, and that it would have been good economy if I had spent the whole ^or the
greater part^ of the sum at my command on the rarities then procurable, leaving
the purchase of articles ^of^ comparatively common occurrence to futurity. There
are opportunities which only occur once in a lifetime, and which, if lost, never again
present themselves. On the other hand, it is possible that if I had indulged my
wishes, I might have lost myself in the bibliomaniacal rut, and never afterwards
escaped from it. At all events I acted for the best, and I have reaped infinite profit in
respect of my studies and writings from the books which I did get at the time. They
consisted of such works as the great old Fathers, critics, and divines of Christendom
– the collections of original chronicles and contemporary documents, the fountains
of history, by Muratori, Bouguet and his continuators, Langebek, &c. – the
antiquarian Thesauruses of Graevius and Gronovius, Ugolini, and others, treasurehouses indeed of research and knowledge – the more important recent historians –
the series of travellers, ancient and modern, who have explored the earth and
bequeathed their narratives of adventure and observation to posterity – some of the
best editions of the ancient and modern classical writers – and works of reference of
different descriptions, – besides the few rarities above spoken of. I am now sailing
on a tack directly contrary to what which [sic] I then pursued. I am endeavouring to
secure the rare indispensable essential to my scheme, neglecting books which may
be got at any time, leaving the acquisition of such to my old age, or to – yourself.

326

The result of the operations above described mentioned, extending over the years
1834, 1835, and 1836, was the acquisition of a very large number of works of first-rate
importance and usefulness – and of not a few very scarce and precious volumes –
but all combining utility with rarity. My chief purchases in history, travels and
general literature were at this time and long afterwards from Mr Thorpe, Mr John
Bohn, Mr. James Bohm, and Mr Henry G. Bohn; and in theology and Oriental
literature from Messrs Straker. Mr Lilly ^too, and Messrs Willis and Sotheran,^
has^ve^ supplied me ^from time to time^ with many very valuable books from
during the dur the last thirty years. [marginal insertion: almost the whole period
that I have been a collector. Most of the bibliopoles I looked up to with reverence in
those early days are now no more; and my contemporaries are, like myself, greyhaired men. A cordiality and almost affection subsists between a bookseller and his
client such as hardly exists in any other similar relationship.]
From the first very first, as already stated (I mean from 1834) I endeavoured to steer
clear of bibliomania. I acted then, and have always acted, on a clearly defined
principle in developing the library. I began by compiling, from special
bibliographies, catalogues, works of criticism and literary history, and otherwise, an
ideal Catalogue – of a library such as might serve, not myself individually, but a
whole family of varying pursuits and tastes, – I have revised this Catalogue from
time to time, but always endeavouring to preserve its proportions, and in adherence
to the same principle, viz., not to include books which are merely precious on
bibliomaniacal
[p. 11]
grounds, but to make utility and interest, liberally construed, the test and ticket of
admission. On this principle I have, as a general rule, rejected ‘Large Paper’ copies,
and copies printed in an unusual manner, except when the superiority of the
impressions of the plates, or of the colouring in the case of books of Natural
History, or the fact of the armorial bearings being emblazoned in the case of works
of genealogy and heraldry, rendered them desirable. Books printed on vellum I have
put away from me (except in a very few instances) as seducing damsels, temptresses
like those who assailed the virtue of the anchorites in the Thebaid. [marginal
327

insertion: I had but a certain sum to spend & had to calculate accordingly] The
original editions ^Editiones Principes^ of the classical writers, ancient and modern
– those in which immortal ideas first met the eyes of mortal men – editions or
books which have in a manner become as it were historical documents – works
which illustrate the progress ^history^ of thought as steppingstones in the march of
human progress, although now long superseded – and books which reflect as in a
mirror the age that produced them, and enable us to recall, sympathise, and
identify ourselves by an immortal charity with the generations of the past – these I
have considered fair game. A few specimens of the early presses, for the purpose of
exhibiting the progress of typography, and a few well-chosen Manuscripts, selected
in order to shew the progress of writing and illumination in Europe and the form
and character of books, or what serve for such, among the Eastern nations, likewise
formed and form part of my scheme. I have thus, you will perceive, a clear and
distinct conception of what I want – there are well-defined limits to my design –
and that design is fairly within the compass of attainment. I do not seek, for
example, to possess the whole series of first editions of the Classics, and[?] like the
late Lord Spencer, but a few of them only, and if possible, the choicest and most
valuable of the group. I do not aim at obtaining the seven folio editions of
Cranmer’s Bible, and the entire series of successive editions of the Scriptures in
English, like Mr. Lea Wilson; nor a collection of all the editions of all Bibles
published in all languages, like Lorck in the last century and the Duke of Sussex in
this, – I am satisfied with one copy of Cranmer’s and, if possible, the editio princeps,
or mother text, of each of the successive versions or recensions, from that of Tyndal
to that of James I. in English, and one (if possible, the first) edition of each of the
more important translations in foreign languages. I do not, in like manner, care to
possess the entire series of the Romances of Chivalry, good, bad, and indifferent,
like the Prince of Essling, but the best of them only, – and so in similar instances. I
am far from undervaluing the interest or depreciating the importance and value of
special accumulations such as those I have just mentioned, but my object is, I
repeat, not special but general or catholic collection – I wish to have, not
everything, but the best in each department, and thus to form a broad and
sufficient basis on which any one of my successors hereafter may build towers or
wings of special development according to his prevailing pursuit or taste. Some
328

departments in the Library connected with my own pursuits have thus actually
already outgrown the general proportion which I have wished theoretically to
maintain; but this has been through the necessity of providing myself with the
[p. 12]
tools necessary for my personal use in those departments; and the increase consists
for the most part, not in rarities, but in books of ordinary occurrence. Such
superfluities, either in my own case or that of others, can easily be got ready rid of
in future days if found to occupy too much space; and I shall ^will^ hereafter
indicate the principle on which I should recommend such clearances to be carried
into effect.
I have steadily pursued the development of the Library on the preceding principles
during the last thirty years that have elapsed since 1834, – with intervals ^indeed^ of
comparative inaction during my various residences abroad (although even then I
have seldom returned without a cargo of purchases), but with increased activity
during the last ten years or twelve years.
While gradually picking up the rarer articles of my scheme, I have established a
connection with various agents, principally booksellers, at home and abroad, which
gives me a knowledge of such books as are for sale, not only in England but in
Germany, Hungary, Poland, the Low Countries, France, and Italy, and even in Spain
and Portugal. I have communication with Denmark, and hope soon to have such
with Austria – and China and Japan have also opened their arms to me. In
illustration of the advantages of this connection I may mention that I telegraphed
not long ago for a rare little book, probably unique, advertised for a few shillings in
a catalogue published in the recesses of Germany, and received it in due course by
post a few days afterwards. I similarly obtained the original edition of Marco Polo,
of which only three or four copies are known, by telegraph, from Vienna, five or six
years ago. While other customers are bargaining or hesitating, a speedy and decisive
order has over and over again secured me treasures of this description. I have also
frequently carried off rarities of great interest in public competition at sales,
through local agency, at Brussels, Munich, Augsburg, Paris, and Rome. Mr. Molini
329

and Mr. Nutt were for many years my principal assistants in these foreign
campaigns, and likewise, and more especially since the death of those two
gentlemen, Mr Bernard Quaritch, who has acted for me on occasions innumerable,
and at home as well as abroad, with admirable judgment. I have always (let me add)
kept short accounts and dealt liberally with my professional agents, and hence they
have generally given me the first or an early offer when rare articles, such as they
knew or thought I must be on the look-out for, came before them. I have found it a
very effective plan to furnish particular persons with lists of desiderata – of the
books I want. I have had one of these lists circulated from time to time on the
Continent by means of Mr. Quaritch. A great many valuable books which are
seldom or never met with in sales or catalogues have thus found their way to me.
But I have always been checked in the exercise of this plan by a fear of the fish
coming to my net (as they are occasionally apt to do) in inconvenient numbers at
once.
All my acquisitions have been from my own resources, – from Lady Mary Lindsay
Crawford’s legacy till it was exhausted, and from my allowance since. The Report, to
which this Letter is introductory, will indicate the degree of progress made in
[p. 13]
accomplishing my object. I am not however satisfied with the progress hitherto
achieved; and ^various considerations concur to render^ a point that is at present,
and has for some time past been dwelling on my mind, is this. We no longer
[marginal insertion: an increased vigour of action expedient. We no longer] live to
the days of Methuselah, – although I have done much, there is still much to do, – it
is not as if I was only twenty-five years old – I am now ^considerably^ past fifty, no
longer young; and ere many years be past, the vigour and energy of life will sensibly
abate. Books of great rarity, included in my scheme, are constantly occurring for
sale, but I can only ^hitherto I have only been able to^ secure a certain number of
them for lack of funds, – when a very rare and precious one ^has^ occurs^ed^ for
which I have ^had^ to pay a large sum, the acquisition ^has^ to a certain extent
cripples^d^ me for the time. For example, the purchase of the Mazarine Bible at
Bishop Daly’s sale five ^or six^ years ago – that of the beautiful vellum Catholicon of
330

Guttemberg at the sale of the Munich duplicates – and that of the York Missal at the
Savile sale (the only copy, not only of the edition but of all the five known editions
which is not in a public library), and which I was obliged to buy against the British
Museum – purchases of this nature, of objects which form the glory of the Library,
can ^could^ only be effected by me through the forgoing of other articles
^desiderata^ almost, if not equally necessary – as, for example, that of the blackletter Chaucer in the same sale in which I bought the Missal – the only perfect copy
of the edition known, and which I fear I shall never have another opportunity of
acquiring, – the three or four other black-letter editions only existing, moreover, in
^to^ the case[?] ^extent^ of a single copy of each of them, all of which are in
libraries either public or not likely to be dispersed. Again, my plan has been, when a
special collection of great interest occurred for sale, to pick (as it were) the plums
out of the pudding – to buy out of it its rarest and most precious volumes in as great
number as I could afford – thus availing myself of the search and labour of men who
had devoted themselves to those particular branches of collection, and multiplying
(so to speak) my own life by that of others theirs’. In the instances in which I have
done this, it has been comparatively easy for me to fill up the lacunae, or vacant
spaces, after these ready-hewn blocks of literature had been placed on my shelves.
But for each opportunity which I have been able thus to improve, numbers have
slipped away – my life will be too short to remedy it – and even supposing that you
or others ^should^ carry on my plans, much greater expense will ^would^ be
incurred (for reasons which I will presently mention) than would have been the
case had I been in a position to act energetically and promptly in the interest (as I
conceive it) of the family, as I wished to do. It is ^has been^ through this crippling
consideration likewise that I am ^have been^ afraid (as I already said) of circulating
my lists of desiderata too extensively, or including in them all that I want^ed^, lest I
should embarrass myself through the very success which might attend the process.
–
[single word struck though, illegible] You must not for a moment imagine that I
complain of all this, in the least degree, – I have had, in the legacy from Lady Mary,
and in a liberal allowance from my father, the means of doing very much more than
falls to the lot
331

[p. 14]
of most men, similarly circumstanced. I merely mention the fact as a fact ^as
explanatory^ explanatory of what is above stated. and justificatory of what I propose
to do, viz. to request my father to put at my disposal a sum of money to be set apart
expressly as a reserve-fund, for the purpose of supplementing my usual means and
enabling me to act vigorously towards the completion of the family Library in
accordance with the principle upon which its restoration ^restoration and^
development has been schemed and planned. [marginal insertion: Under the
circumstances, and with the view to the more energetic action thus suggested, I had
determined to request my father to place at my disposal a sum of money to be set
apart expressly as a reserve-fund, for the purpose of supplementing my usual means
and enabling me to act vigorously towards the completion of the family library, in
accordance with the principle upon which its restoration has been schemed and
thus far execut ^executed^ [struck through in pencil] carried out; and I have not a
doubt but that he would have consented to this, – but I am happy to say that I have
now a prospect, through new family arrangements, of ample independence, such as
will enable me to carry out with energy the scheme so long in petto, and at present,
after more than thirty years, not so very far from consummation.]
Independently of my advance in years, there is ^was^ another reason why time
should not be lost if the object in view is ^was^ to be effected. Rare and valuable
books are fast disappearing from the market, and their price is higher now when
they do occur than at any previous period. Ours will probably be one of the last
great private libraries formed in England ^and even in Europe^, of the class of
which the Harleian, La Vallière, Georgian, Roxburghe, Spencer, and Grenville
collections ^and that, I believe, of the Duke of Aumale, have been, or^ are the most
noble examples, – such libraries have ceased in France – and various causes will
probably prevent their frequent formation in this country. At the time when Sir
Mark M. Sykes, Mr Heber, Mr. Grenville, Lord Spencer, the Duke of Roxburghe, and
George the Third (to say nothing of earlier virtuosi), formed their collections, the
interest in old books was confined to private individuals, and the public libraries
were in great measure indifferent, – the British Museum and the Bodleian did
nothing in that way at home, nor the ‘Bibliothéque du Roi’ at Paris. The
332

consequence was, that a large number of rare books, not to be found in public
libraries, appeared periodically in the market, passing from the [Maffeo] Pinelli to
the Roxburghe, from the Roxburghe to the Sykes, and from the Sykes (for example)
to the Heber collection – then again to be dispersed – many of them being of course
absorbed into the great and enduring libraries of Lord Spencer, Mr Grenville, and
others – but still a large proportion remaining open to the acquisition of private
collectors at each of these successive epochs. But for some years past the public
libraries both at home and abroad have been endeavouring to fill up their gaps
^lacunæ^ by competition at public sales and otherwise, giving large prices – against
which I have myself had frequently to contend, sometimes succumbing, sometimes
successful. Once so absorbed, a book of first-rate rarity is lost to private collectors
for ever. Many private collections have also been presented to public libraries, like
those of George III. and Mr Grenville to the British Museum, – this has, of course, to
a certain extent disarmed competition in the case of the national libraries thus
enriched, but on the other hand it has lessened the number of purchaseable books
and removed many unique or excessively rare volumes altogether from the market,
rendering their acquisition a simple matter of impossibility. In many cases three or
four copies of a very precious book have thus accumulated in the British Museum;
and unless it should sell such duplicates, as has been done at Munich (although the
circumstances of the two cases would be different), or
[p. 15]
exchange them for books of equal value, there is scarce^ly^ a chance of obtaining
any of them. Amateurs again, especially in Paris, and of the generally of the
nouveaux-riches class, have devoted themselves to the formation of small and
special collections, cabinets instead of libraries, suitable to their restricted dwellingplaces, – competing fiercely for the possession of the rarities peculiar to their
respective specialities – thus raising the pecuniary value of such books much above
that which they bore in times when collection was of a more general and liberal
character. The interest, for example, newly awakened (rather too late) in the
ancient genealogical history of France, and which is not confined to the ‘noblesse,’
has had the effect of increasing the mercantile value of the more important works in
that branch of French historical literature to such a degree that I constantly see
333

book see books which I bought fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years ago for a
comparative trifle either advertised at five, eight, or ten times the sum I then gave
for them, or left open to the highest bidder in private competition. [marginal
insertion: The old French Romances of Chivalry also sell for four times what what
they used to even in the time of the sale of the Prince D’Essling.] So too the older
books on American history and antiquities have, through trans-Atlantic
competition (for the new public libraries and private collections in New York,
Boston, &c.), become quadrupled or quintupled in value of late years, – some[?], in
fact, [one word struck though, illegible] and it is fortunate for me that (as in the case
of French genealogy) I acquired many years ^long^ ago the greater number of the
works I wanted of this description. The consequence of all this is, as I said, that the
number of purchaseable books ^rarities^ has been diminishing and the price of
books (^especially^ in good library condition) has been rising for some years past.
And there is every prospect of this continuing. Even therefore if I was^ere^ only
twenty-five, it would be good economy at present to [The follow passage is crossed
through: do as much as I possibly could at once. Unless a change should take place
in the public taste, of which there is no apparent possibility ^likelihood^, ten
thousand pounds would probably effect as much during the next five years as
fifteen or eighteen thousand would, scattered over the ensuing ten. Had I, in short,
the means, I would at once set to work and purchase the books required, rare and
unrare, in all the departments, convinced on the grounds just stated that this would
be true economy and wisdom. But as this cannot be, I fall back on the expedient
just suggested, of a reserve-fund, on which I may draw in supplement of my
allowance when necessary, in order to secure books which I have no reasonable
prospect of obtaining if I miss current opportunities. I should in that case have no
scruple in circulating much fuller lists of Desiderata.
There is one object of collection, indeed, which I scarcely venture to hint at, but
which some day or other I may endeavour to realise, – at present it would be far
beyond my means. I have always (as you have already perceived) proceeded on the
principle that a family library should be catholic in character – should include the
best and most valuable books, landmarks of thought and progress, in all cultivated
languages, Oriental as well as European. What one member of the family cannot,
334

another may be able to read and appreciate. Nor ought such a library to be limited
to a family only; the friends of the family, and those whose friendship would do
them honour, ought equally to have access to it; and in our own case the motto on
its]
[p. 16]
do as much as I possibly could at once. It is not to be supposed that money, even
lavishly expended, is omnipotent to procure the desiderata wished for, and still less
at a moment’s notice; but the moral[?] moral of my argument is ^reflections come
to this^ that it would be wise to set to work as soon as possible, and purchase the
books required, rare and even unrare, in all departments of the library, under the
conviction, on the grounds just stated, that this would be true economy and
wisdom in the long run. I shall henceforward, at all events, have no scruple in
circulating much fuller lists of my desiderata.
There is one subject of collection, rather out of the usual scope of private libraries,
which has occupied much of my attention, and upon which I would say a few words
in these introductory pages. I have always (as you have already perceived)
proceeded on the principle that a family library should be catholic in character –
should include the best and most valuable books, landmarks of thought and
progress, in all cultivated languages, Oriental as well as European. What one
member of the family cannot, another may be able to read and appreciate. Nor
ought such a library to be limited to a family only; the friends of the family, and
those whose friendship would do them honour, ought equally to have access to it;
and in our own case the motto on its every volume should virtually be, like that on
the books of Grolier and Maioli,
LINDESIORUM PRINCIPIS,
COMITIS CRAFORDIAE,
ET AMICORUM.
On this principle of literary catholicity you will be prepared, I think (I cannot
answer for your mother’s or your grandmother’s sentiments in this respect) to
335

recognise and acquiesce in the frequent occurrence in this Report of books in
languages – as, for example, Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, Persian, Sanscrit, Chinese,
Japanese, and others – very foreign to our European ears. Among these exotic
growths the Arabic, and especially the Persian, departments are well, the latter even
richly provided, – we have a good number of valuable Turkish books, chiefly
historical, – and a small but interesting collection of Japanese works; while the
collection of Chinese literature is unusually complete, although I am still in search
of many desiderata. I fear that a ^the Chinese department of^ Chinese ^a^ library
must always occupy a larger amount of room than that of the other Oriental
nations, – partly because literature has been cultivated in China for more than two
thousand years, and its productions consequently surpass in number those of any
other Eastern people, and partly because the art of printing from engraved blocks of
wood, or what we style in Europe ‘by xylography,’ has been practised there for above
half that period, rendering the acquisition of good editions of standard Chinese
works tolerably easy; while, with the exception of a few Hindoo, Turkish, Persian,
and Arabic books printed or lithographed during the last century by the English,
Hindoos, and Mahometans in India, by the Turks at Constantinople, by the Persians
at Tabriz and Teheran, and by Mehemet Ali and his successors at Boulac, (the
suburb of Cairo), the great works of thought in these various languages must be
sought for in manuscript, and such MSS., especially in complete condition, seldom
^nowadays^ appear in the European market. The question therefore arises, with
respect to
[p. 17]
this MS. literature, whether it would be the wiser course to collect Oriental MSS. by
agents specially commissioned for the purpose in those distant lands – where many
such relics of the most precious description, both for literary value and artistic
illumination might, I am convinced, be still obtained, – or, in lieu of this, to
purchase the libraries of deceased Oriental scholars or collectors entire, retain the
MSS. which may be considered desirable, and dispose of the remainder. Against the
former and in favour of the latter course it may be urged that rare and valuable
MSS. have to be waited fo and watched for as desiderata in the East, as much as the
corresponding rarities of European literature have to be waited and watched for in
336

the West; while each private collection bought entire represents, as it were, and
concentrates into the moment of such sale and purchase a lifetime of watchful
success and accumulation. The latter course appears to me therefore to be at once
the most economical and surest, although the former may be worth adoption in
particular cases, – and, in fact, I have already tried both expedients experiments
with success. Meanwhile I have for some time past, as in the cases previously
alluded to, wat carefully watched the sales of the libraries of the great Oriental
scholars of Europe, with the view of securing such of their books or MSS. as fall
within my scheme, – grieving in each instance for the loss to science of the scholars
in question, but remembering that in almost all such cases the dispersion or
disposal of libraries of a special description is a gain to the surviving children or
relations of the defunct savant. [marginal asterisk: see below] Under any
circumstances, and one way or the other, no delay should now take place in
developing our Arabic, Persian, and other Oriental collections; for in the damp and
uncared for book-rooms ^libraries^ of the East the MSS are perishing every day
through neglect, partly in consequence of the development of printing and
lithography in the countries where those arts have been established, superseding
their use and value ^of MSS^; [single word struck though, illegible] ^and^ there are,
on the other hand, indications in the not infrequent purchase of Oriental MSS. by
Greeks, Turks, and Arabs in London, for retransport to the East, that a spirit of
conservatism and appreciation – shall I even say, of bibliomania? – is awakening
even under the noontime sun Oriental noontide sun, which has thus its effect in
raising the price of such commodities in England and transporting them gradually
back beyond our grasp to the soil of their nativity, – either way, consequently,
pointing the moral that we should make our Oriental hay while the ^sun^ still
shines upon us. I am half afraid that you will grudge the space upon our shelves
(although not so very great after all) devoted to these Oriental literatures, but any
such prejudice will soon dissipate itself in the purer air of liberal appreciation for
which I plead. We of the Western world sin grievously against modesty
* Note on purchase of Bland Hamilton Forbes &c.

[p. 18]

337

in asserting ^assuming^, as we commonly do, like the Greeks but without their
excuse, that all science, art, and literature not European must needs be inferior and
uninteresting, in a word, barbarous. This is very far from being the case.

I have written this ^you^ this letter ^my dear Ludovic^ - not from Haigh or Dun
Echt, but from our villa at San Domenico below Etruscan Fiesole, where I hope ere
many days to hail your advent from England. The sky is clear, the sun is shining, the
air is delicate and perfumed with the early violet, while the scent of the nespole, so
fragrant during the winter, is loathe to leave us – and birds are beginning to sing,
although the snow lies still on the Vallombrosa mountains, – the bells of Florence
come in musical chorus across the slopes, rising and falling with the cadence of the
breeze, – the vale of the Arno, glittering with villas, while in the sunshine, and
bounded by grey rec receding hills, lies before me, expanding to the eye as I gaze
down the gentle valley, the ‘Vale of Fair Women’ (as by its traditional name), which
domesticates ^secludes^ our own domain, watered by the Africo, ^and^ clad
everlastingly in olive green, and diversified with cypresses, pointing ^that point^ to
the blue heavens with a finger more perennial and more eloquent than the obelisks
of Thebes. All is as Gray painted it in one of his Latin poems, a farewell to Fiesole, a
hundred years ago. And yet this scene and valley, so peaceful and secure, was once
the refuge of the young and gay of Florence when the ‘Black Death’ reigned there
and over all Italy in the fourteenth century, and when the conviti of Boccaccio
passed the latter half of their ‘Decameron’ in a villa within these precincts, which
some believe to be the one we now inhabit. But what is just now more specially
present in my thoughts is another and yet still a literary memory. Turning
Northwards, I see from our garden, above us, and below the towers[?] ^brow^ of
Fiesole, the long line of the terraced gardens and villa of the Medici, ^the work of
Michelozzo,^ where Cosimo and Lorenzo and their less worthy successors lived and
died, and where the Platonic Academy held its meetings immortalised by Landino. I
little thought in my boyhood when Cosimo and Lorenzo were the object of my
worship at Eton, that I should one day dwell beside their favourite San Domenico,
look up to their villa, the work of Michelozzo, and point to my son a parallel and a
moral from their history. The parallel is this : – What commerce did, directly, for
338

the Medici in the fifteenth century, commerce has done indirectly for ourselves
^our own family^ in the nineteenth. In the days of Cosimo, with above thirty
baronies at our back and thousands of vassals ready to ride at our command, even
against the royal banners, our revenues in actual coin (even including those
received from the customs of sea-ports) were comparatively small, and would not
have availed for the collection of books or pictures, even had the taste for such gear
existed in those days in ^feudal^ Scotland. But now, when those thirty baronies are
to ourselves as things of the past, and we have, as a Spaniard would say, but one
‘hat’ to boast of, at least in Scotland, the growth of trade
[p. 19]
and commerce has, by a strange recompense, afforded us, through the possession of
coal^fields^ in England, the means of doing that which our more powerful
ancestors, the contemporaries of Cosimo, could not have compassed — of building
up our old Library after the example of the Medici, and in the mode they would
themselves have acted upon had they been now living. The moral, on the other
hand, to be derived from the parallel is this : – It is the peculiarity of Britain that,
within ^under beneath the shadow of^ her time-honoured constitution, land and
commerce, aristocracy and democracy, authority and liberty, are reconciled and
balanced under the mild control of a Constitutional ^Limited^ Monarchy, crescent
through a thousand years – to the effect of bestowing on her, through the harmony
of this composition, a strength, vitality, and influence which no other land can
boast of. It is the privilege of certain of her families specially to represent this
harmony and reconciliation through their peculiar position as belonging on the one
hand by birth, rank, and landed-proprietorship, to the former, and through the
possession of mineral property, the sinews of manufactures and commerce, to the
latter of these antagonist yet friendly interests. Such is our own case; and from this
privilege there are arise duties, which I trust you will recognize and carry out in
active life more fully than I – seeking out these truths, and truth in general, in the
cloisters of retreat – have been able to do. Such families are the cardines, the hinges
of a society like ours in England, and, as such, are peculiarly bound to practise the
cardinal virtues — of Justice, in weighing and deciding between contending claims
and interests – of Prudence, in conciliating them – of Temperance, in political
339

judgment and action, generally – and of Fortitude, in resisting every temptation to
swerve from the steady and unselfish path of patriotism. ^The representatives of^
F^f^amilies of this stamp, belonging by the past to feudal, by the present to modern
times, are bound by their position to be statesmen of a catholic, not a mere party
type, friends at once to Order and to Progress, but to Progress tempered by Order
— in the conviction that it is at all times true statesmanship and patriotism to
support the weaker side where either party is worthy of esteem and honour — but
especially so now, in this nineteenth century, for the purpose of maintaining that
the balance of parties in the English constitution so long as it may be possible, and
postponing that downward political prolapse which commences from the moment
when either scale of the balance becomes permanently overweighted. These are
views, in their extent, beyond any which the Medici were ripe for in the fifteenth
century, — but what they did recognise and practise was that breadth and
catholicity of taste and interest from which, as from their fount, the views I have
just expressed derive and flow — and which may express itself with ourselves, as it
did with Cosimo and Lorenzo, ^even^ in the peculiar and limited yet suggestive
sphere of a library — of the Library, be it understood, which is the subject of this
Report — and which I have sought to form, not as a bibliomaniac — for such were
not the Medici — but by laying its broad foundations deep in utility ^usefulness^,
and bringing the spoils of many a distant land, through the compulsion of peace,
towards its subsequent edification.

[p. 20]
There is only now one final remark that I should wish to make before closing these
introductory pages, – or, rather, it will be the reiteration and enforcement of one
already made.
The Library which I thus bequeathe [sic], ^restored and amplified,^ to the Lindsays
has not been purchased at a sacrifice of objects which some of them may perhaps
think more important than the acquisition of books or pictures, whether old or
new, – on the contrary, everything has gone on, so far as I have been concerned, in
340

the usual course, according to my father’s plans for the development of his
property, without a single let or hindrance on my account; nor have the interests of
my[?] brothers in the way of advances or assistance ever been sacrificed to claims of
a similar nature promoted by myself. I have never advanced any such claims – I
have had no debts paid for me – whatever has been done has been, one way or the
other, from my own means – my allowance (although ample) has not exceeded that
of the eldest sons of men of incomes much less than that of my father, – the sole
difference is that, instead of spending my money in gambling and racing and other
such toys that perish in the using, I have invested it to a great extent in collections
which, in a merely pecuniary sense, will continually increase in value as years roll
on, as public libraries multiply in the old and newly newer worlds, and as the wear
and tear of time tells on both books in common with all other destructible objects. I
count myself therefore ‘sackless’ in this matter. It is true that circumstances may
change – the breeze of prosperity may desert our sails, as has been the case with us
more than once in past centuries – and the bark of our fortunes may have to
struggle with a “sour blast” of ruin and suffering; but in that contingency the Library
will have its market value, and (unless it be exile or confiscation that oppresses us)
may my present investment may prove a future blessing, a purse in hand wherewith
to start afresh in the battle with fortune. And even then, if this should take place, I
feel confident (from the family instinct within me) that some future Earl or Master
of Crawford – yourself or your successors – will in course of time build up again the
ancestral ^‘Lindesian^ Library,’ as I have done.
That you may live long to appreciate and enjoy it, and may serve your Queen and
country more effectually in many ways than I have done, is, like Hector’s prayer,
that of,
My dearest Ludovic,
Your loving Father,
Lindsay

Sources: List of European and Oriental manuscripts compiled by A. B. Railton of
Sotheran’s, July 1901; UML, Railton Papers, ABR/2/2. Lists of items received from
Haigh Hall, 1901; UML, JRL Archive, JRL/6/1/6/1/5. Guardbook recording
manuscripts and books received by the John Rylands Library from Longford Hall,
1904–06; UML, JRL Archive, JRL/6/1/7/14.
Sotheran’s schedule appears to have been compiled hastily, in order to facilitate the
sale, and their totals were derived from the highest manuscript number in each
series, overlooking the fact that some numbers were never used, and in the case of
the Coptic manuscripts there were three extra volumes (2a, 20a and 23a). There
were several deductions from the numbers in Sotheran’s list, including items which
were retained at Haigh Hall as family manuscripts (heirlooms), were reclassified as
printed books, or were not sold for some other reason; in a few cases, items could
not be found at Haigh.
13 Latin manuscripts were left at Haigh as family manuscripts and 1 was transferred
to printed books; 93 English manuscripts were left at Haigh, 6 were transferred to
printed books, 34 were not sold (mainly autographs), 15 numbers were not used; 15
French manuscripts were left at Haigh as family manuscripts, 16 were not sold
(mainly autographs); 1 Italian manuscript was not found, 1 was retained as a family
manuscript, 1 was not sold; 1 Dutch manuscript was transferred to printed books; 2
German manuscripts were transferred to printed books and 1 was left at Haigh as a
family manuscript; 1 Arabic number and 28 Persian numbers were not used; 6
Japanese books were not found, 1 was left at Haigh.
