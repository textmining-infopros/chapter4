Abstract
As an exploratory ethnography of Semaphore Studio307, an academic makerspace
situated in the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto, this work
provides a rich description and analysis of students’ experiences in an academic
makerspace. Its findings are intended to inform the design and administration of this
space and others like it with the voices and perspectives of the people who use them.
Topics covered are how students first discovered the space, their motivations, needs
and wants once there, views of the space, and how they worked together within it.

Introduction
For this thesis, I will explore a single university makerspace over an academic year
with a focus on the experiences of students who use the space. I will do so through
an exploratory ethnography (Stebbins, 2001; Spradley, 1980) of Semaphore
Studio307, a new makerspace in the Faculty of Information at the University of
Toronto.
This chapter introduces the research project by first providing a brief background on
myself, my position, my objectives, the research site, and the people who enlivened
Semaphore Studio307 (hereafter referred to as Studio307). It then provides an
overview of the chapters that follow. Chapter 2, the literature review, provides
background on making and makerspaces for readers unfamiliar with these concepts.

1.1 Researcher Background
I came to this graduate program (Library and Information Science) from a
background in community radio. I worked at a station in Halifax, NS and because
we always piped the live broadcast throughout the offices, each day was spent
listening to radio produced by community members. I would hear shows about the
Eritrean diaspora in Nova Scotia or the minutiae of the Uniacke Square
neighborhood and wonder what drove people to do this – to show up every week,
participate in this piece of public life, and make radio? I also enjoyed the creativity
and active participation and I wanted to retain aspects of this in my work in Library
and Information Science. To that end, I wanted to apply my curiosity about why
people participated in the public or commons to libraries. I was not interested in

1

2

artifacts or books, I was interested in the people inside. Because of this interest, I
chose a research project that included the library, but also the people that enliven it
and, specifically, their motivations and impacts. I also chose a site, a makerspace,
which shared community radio’s creativity, productivity, and even rhetoric.

1.2 Researcher Position
This is a subjective work written by someone intimately involved with the Studio307
project. I helped design and build the space and I worked in it. This involved
organizing a community consultation process for the space design, setting up
curricula, scheduling, purchasing, budgeting, securing additional funding
throughout the year, and staffing the space with my co-worker, Che (some names
have been changed at participants’ request). In this research, and in keeping with
the idea of reflexivity, I will embrace and acknowledge my presence and experience.
Liz Stanley and Sue Wise (1993) inspired the position from which I am writing this,
and discussions of this position and the decisions behind it are available in Chapter
3 – Methods.

1.3 Objectives
Rather than trying to prove the value of Studio307, validate existing claims about
academic makerspaces, or come up with my own universal theory for the impact of
makerspaces, I instead want to ask a simple question, ‘what is happening here?’
(Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007, p. 164). To that end, my motivating research
questions are:
Why did students come to Studio307? What were their expectations and views of the
space? How did they characterize their experience of the space? Finally, how can
these new understandings inform the development of this space and others like it?

3

These questions are broad, but also suitable for the descriptive stage of an
exploratory ethnography. When trying to understand a new phenomenon, Marcia
Bates recommends that “description comes first” (2005, p. 2) and Robert Stebbins
argues that to understand a phenomenon well, you must start by looking at it in broad
terms (2001, p. viii). Nancy Fried Foster & Susan Gibbons’ ethnography of
students’ library use at the University of Rochester also serves as a model for me in
their general and exploratory approach to their research (2007). They purposely set
aside presuppositions and sought to answer their basic question - what do students
do when they write a research paper (p. v)? I also want to point out that while asking
“what happens here” may seem broad, the site and scope are not. If the driving
question at the core of most ethnographies is “what is happening here?”, my focus
is on the “here” through a topic-oriented, micro-ethnography of a single social
situation (Spradley, 1980, p. 30). To be clear, I am not seeking to explain maker
culture as a whole or make assertions about the global potential of makerspaces.
Instead, in keeping with a scope appropriate for a master’s thesis and with an eye on
future concatenation (Stebbins, 2001), I aim to describe this particular community
and my understanding of their experience.
Because this research project will provide a description and analysis of students’
experiences in an academic makerspace (including my own experience), it
constitutes a relevant contribution to broader discussion about the pedagogical
impacts of these spaces (Benjes-Small, McGlynn Bellamy, Resor-Whicker, &
Vassady, 2017; Halverson & Sheridan, 2014). As a site-specific ethnography with
an emphasis on the personal experiences of participants, it will also be of interest to
the members of its community and administrators of the space and other spaces like
it. Finally, this research is intended to be for its participants, rather than about them
(Stanley & Wise, 1993). There is a goal for this research and that goal is to inform
the design and administration of this space and others like it with the voices and

4

perspectives of the people who use them. To that end, I will also be including
recommendations (see Chapter 10 – Conclusions and Recommendations).

1.4 Field Site
Studio307 is an approximately 300-square-foot, student-run studio workspace
within the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. It is located in Room
307 of the Claude T. Bissell Building and acts as an extension of the Semaphore
Research Cluster. Two students staff the space - myself and another student, Che.
Staff members oversee open hours, organize and run programming, and manage the
space on a day-to-day level. Funding and equipment are provided by: Semaphore
Research Cluster; TechFund (a student fund); the Inforum (the library within the
Faculty of Information); and the Faculty itself through space and institutional
support.
This academic year, 2016-2017, was the pilot year for the space. The goals for
Studio307’s pilot year included ensuring sustainability for future years and to build
an active, enlivened making and fabrication lab accessible to all students within the
Faculty. The focus at Studio307 is small-scale fabrication, prototyping, critical
making, exhibition-building, and skills development for current and future librarians
and museum professionals.

1.5 People
Because Studio307 is situated within the Faculty of Information, it serves graduate
students in the following concentrations: Library and Information Science, Museum
Studies, User Experience Design (UX), Knowledge and Information Management,
Information Systems and Design (ISD), Critical Information Policy Studies (CIPS),
Culture and Technology, Book History and Print Culture, and Archives and Records
Management. In this way, it differs from academic makerspaces in engineering or

5

applied design departments, or spaces intended to serve entire university
communities. For example, the programming in Studio307 was designed to serve
students in an Information Faculty. Therefore, rather than offering a general
introduction to Internet of Things technology and programming, we offered
workshops that also touched on culture and privacy issues, or how to integrate this
technology into exhibits. Or, rather than just a basic introduction on how to operate
3D printers, we provided workshops on how to maintain and repair 3D printers
targeted at future librarian and museum professionals who may require a stronger
command of the technology. Unlike spaces targeted at engineering or applied design
students, Studio307 did not offer any heavy machinery (e.g. CNC machines or large
wood-working tools).
While my observations cover all the students and faculty who came through the
space during my time there, I tend to, in this work, concentrate on a core group of
eight students. These eight include regular participants, peripheral participants, and
people who only visited the space once. Chapter 4 – An Overview of Studio307
includes an introduction to each.

1.6 Thesis Overview
After providing a summary of relevant literature, sensitizing concepts, and my
methods, I will delve into my findings, which were reached through inductive,
iterative, and thematic analyses and then compiled and written as a fieldnotecentered narrative (Emerson, Fretz, & Shaw, 2011). The first findings chapter
(Chapter 4) is a description of Studio307 focused on the physical layout, staffing
structure, and people within the space. Next, I will explore how students first
discovered or became involved with the space (Chapter 5), why students came or
their motivations (Chapter 6), their needs or wants once there (Chapter 7), how they
viewed the space (Chapter 8), and, finally, how we worked together within it

6

(Chapter 9). I will end with recommendations for this space and others like it
(Chapter 10).

Literature Review
This chapter begins with definitions of makerspaces and makers, then narrows in on
similar works on makerspaces in libraries and academic libraries. Finally, it
concludes with an overview of the sensitizing concepts (Blumer, 1954) which will
serve as theoretical lenses for the study.

2.1 Makerspaces
Researchers have provided histories of what is often called the “maker movement”
(Dougherty, 2012) that are tied to DIY culture and political responses to
industrialization (Maxigas, 2013), but also, subsequently, critiques of creeping
commercial interests (Sivek, 2011; Grenzfurthner & Schneider, 2009). There are
also theories that posit makerspaces as the site for the next industrial revolution
(Anderson, 2012), transforming education (Martinez & Stager, 2013), or serving as
a source of entrepreneurial innovation (Dougherty, 2012). A complete history of this
world (variably known as hacklabs, hackerspaces, or FabLabs, among other
neologisms) and the shift from independent to commercial makerspaces would
require starting as early as the arts & crafts movement, beginning in the late 19 th
century, and working our way forward. For readers interested in this history from an
LIS perspective, I recommend Rebekah Willett’s work, Making, Makers, and
Makerspaces: A Discourse Analysis of Professional Journal Articles and Blog Posts
about Makerspaces in Public Libraries (2016), which provides a succinct
retrospective of the maker movement that goes beyond the history of Make, a
commercial magazine often credited with sparking the current popularity of what it
refers to as the maker movement.

8

Because this ethnography is situated in LIS, I want to remain within that space and
find what I hope will be a common understanding of the terms from within my own
field.
A commonly used definition of makerspaces in LIS is Lauren Britton’s “a place
where people come together to create and collaborate, to share resources,
knowledge, and stuff” (Britton, 2012). This is broad, but likely because no two
makerspaces are the same (Moorefield-Lang, 2015) and pinning them down to one
nicely bundled mission or activity is difficult and, I would argue, limiting and
unnecessary.
The definition of a makerspace can also shift depending on whether the focus is on
the core capabilities of the space (e.g. the technology inside) or on the people or
communities who enliven that space. For example, in her discourse analysis of
makerspace rhetoric, Shannon Crawford Barniskis asks which, if any, ideologies or
uses are privileged over others when journalists or practitioners write about
makerspaces in libraries. She argues that the most common metonym for
makerspaces is “3D Printer,” but that it was journalists who tended to focus on the
technology or capabilities, while library practitioners concentrated on social
connections and access (2015). And, in her earlier work on makerspaces in rural
libraries, she asked both practitioners and patrons to describe their makerspaces and
reported “all participants described the makerspace as a social space where makers
could share the discovery process, support each other, and engage socially”
(Barniskis, 2014). For Crawford Barniskis’ subjects, it was the people and
relationships that defined their makerspaces, despite their surface similarities like
having a 3D printer or a milling machine.
Both the definitions provided by Britton and Crawford Barniskis’ subjects focus on
the social or culture, rather than the function. They leave the door open for a range

9

of activities and implementations, but they may not match how those outside of LIS
understand and see these spaces. To ensure a firm definition for the purpose of this
thesis, I will combine Britton’s focus on sharing knowledge and things; MoorefieldLang’s insistence no two makerspaces are the same; and Crawford Barniskis’
revelation that people outside of this field like to link these spaces to technology.
For this study, a makerspace is defined as: a unique network of people,
programming, and tools organized around a mandate associated with technical
literacy or agency.

2.2 Makers
It is difficult to make generalizations about the types of people who use makerspaces.
Dale Dougherty, founder of Make, divides makers into three groups: zero-to-maker;
maker-to-maker; and maker-to-market (2013). By creating segments, he designates
the maturity of a maker as one who is ready to develop market-destined innovation
or invention. But, often, the mature maker is not maker-to-market, but rather makerto-scholar or maker-to-citizen (Ratto, 2013) or simply maker-to-participant
(Gauntlett, 2011). Dougherty’s definitions of makers have also been criticized, along
with his commercial counterparts Chris Anderson (2012) and Mark Hatch (2014),
for fostering and maintaining a male maker identity focused on a too-narrow range
of interests (Buechley, 2013). Austin Toombs, Shaowen Bardzell, and Jeffrey
Bardzell at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing have
published works based on their 19-month ethnographic research project at a
community hackerspace (2014; 2015) that focuses on how maker identities are
formed and how their subjects merge a neoliberal libertarian ethos with the practical
community maintenance required to sustain their space. They define a maker identity
then as one centered around a libertarian ethos. But Camille Bosqué, in her
dissertation Personal digital fabrication, discourses and practices of diffuse design:

10

A survey into FabLabs, hackerspaces and makerspaces between 2012 and 2015
(titled translated from French), argues that the underlying ethos in her studied spaces
is one of sharing and openness and that this attitude permeates the individual design
and making identity (2016).
What is tricky here, though, is that these identities and ethoses (the libertarian and
the sharer) come from studies of niche independent spaces, not institutional ones like
in a public or academic library. Profiles that are broader also come from perspectives
outside LIS; that is, Dougherty’s profile comes from the commercial sector and
David Gauntlett’s from a broader look at making culture. Matt Ratto’s definitions of
a mature maker as citizen or scholar (2013) get closer to the field and the academic
context, but are more concerned with potential outcomes rather than inputs. There is
a lack of descriptions of maker identities in the LIS sphere and I am assuming this
is to prevent exclusion. Librarians shy away from pinning down their readers and
community members, and there is a tendency, at least in the field of public
librarianship, to say everybody is a maker with the Right Maker Mindset (Egbert,
2016; Burke J. J., 2014).
And so, I return again to Crawford Barniskis’ work on rural makerspaces (2014). In
it, she provides a summary of how library patrons who use the makerspaces see
themselves – collaborative, needing an outlet, enjoying creating and sharing,
enjoying working with their hands, learning new things, and having agency. It is a
diverse list, but so are people. Given the diversity of motivations and identities,
perhaps it is simplest to leave the definition of a maker as someone who learns and
creates, typically in a shared space.

11

2.3 Making in Public Libraries
When you zoom in on the literature of LIS on makerspaces in public libraries, you
find many practice-oriented papers. The work on makerspaces in libraries focuses
predominantly on models for implementation (Britton, 2012; Slatter & Howard,
2013; Good, 2013; Burke J. , 2014), space or tool-focused analysis (Curran, 2012;
Balas, 2012; Gonzalez & Bennet, 2016; Massis, 2013), or practitioner-focused
research (OLA, 2017; Plemmons, 2014). The resulting work tends to define these
spaces, and the people who use them, from the perspective of the administrator. This
may, however, simply be a consequence of how new these spaces are in public
libraries. There simply has not been time to graduate from implementation to deeper
questions about the nature of the experience and impact. Ina Fourie and Anika Myer
identified the need for further research into people’s experiences in library
makerspaces and the impact of makerspaces on information behavior (2015).
Already on that front, Crawford Barniskis (2014; 2015) is currently conducting a
multi-year study of public library makerspaces from participants’ perspectives.
In short, the majority of literature on makerspaces in public libraries tends to come
from the practitioner perspective and focus on concerns of practice. This, however,
with time, is changing.

2.4 Making in Academic Libraries
Most universities have always provided at least elements of what are now branded
as makerspaces. There have always been labs, machine shops, fabrication spaces,
artist studios, and meeting spots sprinkled across most campuses. What differentiates
these elements from what are now often described as makerspaces is putting these
services in one location, investing in them, and naming (Wilczynski, 2015).
According to Vincent Wilczynski (2015) and Craig Forest (Forest, et al., 2014), who
are both from engineering disciplines, there has been a cultural shift on campuses, a

12

pivot towards active, design education and hands-on learning. I would also argue
that another shift is the move from faculties or departments providing these services
and spaces to libraries. In 2015, the Association of Research Libraries (ARL)
surveyed its 124 members to ask about library involvement with fabrication, 3D
printing, and makerspaces. The results were overwhelmingly positive (Wang, Wang,
Wilson, & Ahmed, 2016) with most respondents (64% of 64 respondents) saying
they were either implementing or planning the implementation of makerspace
services. In response to this survey, the ARL developed what is called a SPEC kit
(Altman, Bernhardt, Horowitz, Lu, & Shapiro, 2015). An ARL SPEC kit brings
together survey results and documentation from multiple institutions to help other
libraries learn about new or changing practices. The ARL’s kit on rapid fabrication
and makerspace services is extensive and includes user data, policies, and documents
from 64 member institutions. This is helpful for understanding this shift in academic
library services from the perspective of librarians, but does not include the unfiltered
perspective of participants or students.
According to education scholars Kim Sheridan and Erica Halverson, little of the
existing literature on makerspaces is focused on participant motivation, experience,
or impact (2014). There is also the criticism, already mentioned above, that because
many of these spaces are still new and developing, much of the existing work is
concerned with how to build a makerspace or the experience of building one (BenjesSmall, McGlynn Bellamy, Resor-Whicker, & Vassady, 2017). For example, when
Anne Wong and Helen Partridge ask “what are the experiences of Australian
universities with makerspaces?” (2016), the work focuses on the experience of the
institution and its staff, not its participants. This is similar to the outcome found in
the public library sector of LIS work, where literature focuses on the functions of
implementing and administering a makerspace, or as case studies of other academic
makerspaces (Wang, Wang, Wilson, & Ahmed, 2016; Wilczynski, 2015). However,

13

the LIS field is changing. The first International Symposium on Academic
Makerspaces was held in 2016 at MIT, indicating burgeoning interest. There were,
of course, many sessions focused on implementation issues like staffing, safety, and
management (ISAM, 2016), but there were also reports of a recently initiated fiveyear longitudinal, survey-based, and ethnographic study across three institutions on
student experiences and how makerspaces influence student retention and selfefficacy (Linsey, et al., 2016); an observation and interview-based study of the
Envision Maker Studio at UC San Diego (Delson & Dewald, 2016); and a call for
academic makerspaces to serve as sites for educational and qualitative observational
research that focuses on student experience (Hartmann, 2016). The 2016 American
Society for Engineering Education also offered a 5-paper session called
Makerspaces within the University, which included a paper on assessment based on
student experiences and impact (Penney, et al., 2016), another alluding to future,
student-focused assessment work (Blacklock & Claussen, 2016), and another
concerned with measuring student motivations and the impact of makerspaces on
their perceived abilities based on surveys (Morocz, et al., 2016). While this new
scholarship is exciting, it should be noted that it is still developing, and the majority
is coming from engineering education and engineering faculties. With the exception
of Adam S. Rogers’ work on the librarian’s role in academic makerspaces (2016),
the librarian and library perspective were not mentioned at the first International
Symposium on Academic Makerspaces.
Another criticism is that much of this work centers on proving an academic
makerspace’s value (Radniecki & Klenke, 2017). There are claims that academic
makerspaces provide alternative learning environments that strengthen curriculum
objectives (Burke J. , 2015), that they support innovation and entrepreneurialism
(Delaney, 2015), that they engage and empower students (Watters, 2013), or
promote multi-disciplinary and collaborative learning (Wilczynski, 2015). For a

14

more critical look at how these spaces can improve, there is work coming out of the
Invention Studio at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, GA, including a student paper on
sustaining diversity and inclusion in their makerspace by removing barriers to entry
(Noel, Murphy, & Jariwala, 2016). In this work, the authors identify instances of
inadvertent exclusion from the perspective of students, and the various techniques
they used to promote inclusion at their makerspace (providing training and tours,
offering targeted group events or closed nights for certain communities, promoting
diverse interests outside of engineering through arts-based workshops, and
increasing student leadership roles).
Institutional makerspaces in universities also tend to serve entire university
communities or applied programs like engineering or architecture (typically as
rebranded former machine shops), not library schools. Western University’s Faculty
of Information and Media Studies is currently building a makerspace inside its new
Graduate Resource Centre (FIMS, Western University, 2015), the University of
Texas’ School of Information recently created an in-house makerspace (Ferguson,
2017), and, of course, Studio307 at the University of Toronto’s Faculty of
Information, but these spaces are still young and scholarship within this niche is
sparse. With the exception of Heather Moorefield-Lang’s upcoming work on how
maker skills are taught in library schools (Moorefield-Lang, forthcoming) and
Kyungwon Koh and June Abbas’s work on needed competencies for working in
makerspaces (2015; 2016), in-depth analysis of how current and future library and
museum professionals acquire these skills has yet to be done.
In short, two gaps in the literature and research pique my curiosity and motivate this
thesis. The first is an in-depth focus on participants (the people who come to these
spaces) and asking why they come or what they get out of it. Put simply, I want to
contribute to the stories of the people who use these spaces. The second gap, which

15

is ultimately a consequence of site selection and not intent, pertains to the
experiences of future library and information professionals learning about
fabrication spaces and the associated technology.

2.5 Sensitizing Concepts
There are three sensitizing concepts from the literature I want to introduce. I relied
on these as “directions along which to look” (Blumer, 1954, p. 7) and to help me
understand and interpret my findings. They are:
1. Doreen Massey on the social nature and dimensionality of space (1994;
1999; 2013). According to Massey, we can think about space not just
in terms of land mass or geo-coordinates, but as a dimension – a product
of our relationships. We also get to think about how far those
relationships extend, from tiny local scales like across the house to
global ones, and how they overlap. For Massey, space is dynamic and
multiple, and she describes it as a “pincushion of a million stories”
(2013). This work will use Massey in two ways – first, to remind that
space is simultaneous and multiple (different people can have different
claims or interpretations of the same space, it does not have to be one
way). Second, to help make a connection between students’
apprehensions about a larger global issue (a changing career landscape)
and a tiny room on the third floor of a graduate faculty.
2. Erving Goffman’s concepts of face and front-stage and back-stage
behavior. In his book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life,
Goffman develops the idea that when we meet someone we engage in
a form of theatre. We seek to present a particular version of ourselves,
or face, and essentially control how we are perceived. At the same time,
the other participant in the interaction is attempting to obtain
information and possibly support or circumvent this theatre (1959). In
this thesis, Goffman helps explain a student’s embarrassment and
anxiety about their lack of experience. Goffman also helps us
understand Willet’s finding that librarians engage in frontstage and

16

backstage behavior whether they are talking about a makerspace
publicly or in private (Willlett, 2016).
3. Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger’s use of legitimate peripheral
participation, and Wenger’s use of participation and reification to
understand what they both call “communities of practice” and how they
develop (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1999). Communities of
practice is a term coined by Lave and Wenger to describe how people
engage in collective learning. Their work encompasses workshops,
multiple books and articles, management certificates, blogs, and
training seminars. To summarize it all here would be outside the scope
of this thesis. Instead, I want to introduce the two concepts I will be
using: participation and reification and legitimate peripheral
participation.
For Wenger, participation refers to how members act and interact in a
community and how that contributes to the norms or expectations
within it. Reification though, is the development of norms using
artifacts (e.g. a written list of rules) instead of behavior (Wenger, 1999).
Both are needed and both must be in balance, they complement each
other. Too much participation and things are up in the air or divergent.
Too much reification and you stifle the community. These concepts of
participation and reification will help explain certain barriers for
students, like a lack of formal documentation in the space. While
discussions of participation and reification will be found throughout
this thesis, they are of particular importance in Chapter 7 when I explore
the documentation and communication of skills expectations.
Legitimate peripheral participation refers to how newcomers get
involved in a community. According to Lave & Wenger, they often do
so through small, low-risk actions (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Wenger
uses this to create three levels or classes of participants: a core group,
an active group, and the peripheral group (Wenger, McDermott, &
Snyder, 2002). I am going to use peripheral and core participation in
Chapter 5 to help me understand why students often needed an

17

invitation before they came to the space, and how they made that
transition from the periphery to the core.
In this chapter, I explored current work on makerspaces broadly and within the
public library and academic library contexts. I also outlined the three sensitizing
concepts that will be used in this thesis. Through this exploration, I identified the
gaps within which I seek to position this work – that is, by offering up scholarship
focused on the experiences of participants rather than practitioners, and, specifically,
a focus on library and information studies students. In the next chapter, I will turn to
methods, providing an overview of my chosen methods, justification for those
choices, challenges, and position as a researcher.

18

Methods
Because I wanted to focus on the students who use this space and their experiences,
this thesis is an exploratory study using an ethnographic approach (Stebbins, 2001;
Spradley, 1980). My primary data gathering method was participant observation
(Spradley, 1980). For an academic year, I worked in Studio307 as both a work-study
employee and a researcher. Raymond Gold, who identified potential issues within
participant observation, would likely classify this arrangement as Participant-asObserver, where the researcher is a part of the group being studied (Gold, 1958, pp.
220-221). There are challenges associated with opportunistic or insider research, but
there is also value in that regular, day-to-day, face-to-face contact with research
participants (Merriam, et al., 2001; Chavez, 2008; Taylor, 2011). Employment in the
research site provided me that access and opportunity (Feldman, Bell, & Berger,
2003; Kondo, 1990).
I worked in the site for 8-10 hours per week split over two shifts. Throughout my
workday, I took field notes. I used Robert Emerson, Rachel Fretz, and Linda Shaw’s
methods for writing, coding, and analyzing those jottings and field notes to generate
theory from my observations (2011; Glaser & Strauss, 1967).
Towards the end of the observation period, I conducted semi-structured interviews
with students. These interviews incorporated grand tour questions (Spradley, 1979)
and object elicitation, a variation of photo elicitation (Collier & Collier, 1986;
Harper, 2002) when an object or photo is used to elicit responses from interviewees
and help the flow of the interview (De Leon & Cohen, 2005). Basically, I asked

19

students to bring an example of something they worked on in the space, and those
objects gave us something to talk about, a reference point.
The flow of my methods is illustrated below (Fig. 1):

Fig. 1 Visualization of research methods

The ethnographic record, which is anything related to the documentation of the
cultural scene under study (Spradley, 1980), consisted of audio recordings,
transcriptions, collected ephemera, jottings, and field notes. After ethics approval
was obtained from the University of Toronto’s Research Ethics Board, data
collection took place in the Fall 2016 and Winter 2017 semesters. The fieldwork
stage ended in January, and all told I spent approximately 140 hours in the field and
gathered 236 pages of miscellaneous documentation; everything was kept in both
print and digital versions.

20

Coding and analysis of my data occurred in the latter half of Winter semester. My
coding process was initially based on Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw’s analysis methods
(2011, pp. 143-160) which begin with open coding to identify themes followed by a
more focused coding session looking for specific themes or topics that emerged
during the open coding process. I found this very challenging. I was unable to hold
the entire record in my head, remember where I was, or sort what was essentially a
linear narrative in a binder into different and often overlapping themes. I also found
this analysis method relied too much on repetition of an instance to identify a theme,
so it was difficult for me to identify themes through comparisons or contrasts. It was
here that I turned to Gery Ryan and Russell Bernard’s Techniques to Identify Themes
(2003).
In Techniques to Identify Themes, I found some analysis methods better suited to my
needs and style, such as cutting and sorting. To start, I printed my flagged, interesting
snippets on index cards and started sorting. At first, it was a physical sort, but I soon
realized not everything could be easily binned into one category or theme. I also
wanted to compare and contrast certain cards. To do this, I moved to color-coded
dots and used those to look for common overlaps or pairings between themes, but
also contradictions (Fig. 2). I was hesitant about this tactic at first, it felt laborious,
but it ended up being the most fruitful and flexible analysis method. I also tried Ryan
and Bernard’s suggestion of comparing both similarities and differences. To do this,
I broke out the answers to standard interview questions on a grid (e.g. “how would
you describe this space to a new student?”) and compared them (Fig. 3). Again, this
was fruitful, and while exploring differences raised more questions, it also helped
provide a more diverse and nuanced view of the students who used this space.

21

I returned to Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw when it was time to write and applied their
approach of thematic narratives and excerpt-commentary units to structure my
findings. This method requires researchers to move back and forth between the
world they are presenting, their analysis, and existing scholarship or research. The
goal is to present a work that is well organized, presents the story of the scene
through informants’ words and the researchers’ notes, and serves a scholarly
purpose.

3.1 Discussion of Position
Insider research can present ethical issues and both internal and external criticism
that the researcher is too close to their subjects (Taylor, 2011). But, according to Lyn
and John Lofland, your personal and emotional interests keep you connected to your
ethnographic research and enhance your ability to understand your subjects. They
advocate for “starting where you are” (Lofland & Lofland, 2006, pp. 9-15) and their
call to choose a familiar starting point is based not just on ease-of-access, or what

22

Jeffrey Reimer calls “opportunistic research” (1977), but what they describe as the
“creative wellsprings of the naturalistic approach” (Lofland & Lofland, 2006, p. 15).
Now, despite advocating for this level of familiarity, Lofland and Lofland follow it
with a stern warning about polarities and the importance of keeping some level of
ethnographic strangeness so you can still see novelties (pp. 16-17). In other words,
get close, but not too close. Because of this warning, I worried, often, that I was too
close. This fear was assuaged when I read Stanley and Wise’s Breaking Out Again
(1993). While addressing concerns about methodological and ethical difficulties of
familiarity with a subject, Stanley and Wise reject Lofland and Lofland’s attempt to
retain a small amount of detachment. The authors feel this approach is dishonest and
is still clinging to dated ideas of objectivity (p. 158). I was immersed in Studio307.
I helped design it and build it. I worked in it. To deny that level of familiarity would
be a lie.
In this work, I will also be referencing my own personal and emotional responses
and motivations. Stanley and Wise encourage me not just to acknowledge my
presence and personhood, but to capitalize on and make full use of it (2001, p. 161).
First, I agree that the analytic use of feelings and experiences is “equally as capable
of yielding ‘knowledge’ as conventionally ‘rational’ intellectual behavior” (p. 202).
You will see an example of this when I explore the theme of needing or providing
context and explore how my own social anxieties about intrusion are fodder for
analysis. Second, I also agree that including myself in my research (not just
admitting my presence, but embracing it) “does something to even up the imbalance
of power between researchers and researched, though it obviously can’t remove it”
(p. 177). For example, providing you with a small snippet of my background and
subsequent motivation for tackling this topic may seem like little more than an
attempt to endear myself, but it is also a first step towards opening myself up to the
same level of scrutiny I expected of research participants. You will see more

23

examples of this in Chapter 8 when I discuss the theme of “Peripheral to the
Institution” and examine participants’ statements about the position of Studio307
within its institution and my own failures to navigate that duality.
Finally, a note on my mode of presentation - my tone may, at times, be
conversational rather than conventionally academic. Emerson, Fretz and Shaw
(1995) encourage writing ethnographies as narratives that will interest an outside or
external audience. Because I want my work to be accessible and of use to the
practitioners designing and administering spaces like Studio307, and the participants
making use of them, I try to use an accessible style.
In the following chapters, I turn to my findings.

24

An Overview of Studio307
In this chapter, I will describe the space – how it was created, its physical layout,
equipment, staffing, and the people met throughout this work.

4.1 Field site
Studio307 is a student-run studio workspace within the graduate-level Faculty of
Information at the University of Toronto. It is funded by the Semaphore Research
Cluster, TechFund (a student fund), the Faculty (in the form of space and
administrative support), and the Inforum (the Faculty’s library) with a budget of
approximately $11,000 (this includes staff, equipment purchases, and consumables,
but not loaned equipment, space allocation, or administrative support from
Semaphore and the Faculty). As I wrote on the Studio307 website, “Studio307 was
initially proposed as an extension of the Semaphore Research Cluster in the Faculty
of Information and intended to be a more accessible, open, and hands-on version of
Semaphore. Given: the number of courses in the Faculty of Information requiring or
allowing material deliverables; the emphasis on participatory learning and creation
as a crucial part of library programming and important skillset for future librarians;
and the research interests of our students and faculty across concentrations, the
absence of an accessible creative space was a problem” (Whyte, About 307, 2016).
Studio307 was intended to fill that gap.
The first step in designing the space was a community consultation process, inspired
by Foster and Susan Gibbons’ methods used to inform a renovation project at the
University of Rochester library (2007). While their work spanned two years and a

25

range of tactics, I borrowed two methods that were pertinent and feasible within my
timeframe and ability: draw-and-write responses and design sessions.
To start the process, students were asked to complete community consultation
worksheets that involved both drawing and writing about their ideal space (see Fig.
4. Community consultation worksheet, below). Recruitment methods included
posters in the Faculty building, inclusion in Faculty email newsletters sent to all
students and faculty, distribution of worksheets in classes, targeted recruitment of
underrepresented groups such as Museum Studies students, and personal, face-toface recruitment. Fifteen students completed the worksheets over the Summer
semester of 2016. The following (Fig. 4) is an example of a worksheet filled out by
a student as part of this initial community consultation planning.

Fig. 4. Community consultation worksheet

26

The second stage of this process involved a design workshop (Foster & Gibbons,
2007) in which eleven people participated. The workshop began with individual
analysis of the submitted consultation worksheets to seek out common elements or
themes. This was followed by small group analysis where participants were
encouraged to discuss their individual interpretations. Finally, a large group
discussion explored how to create a composite based on our findings from the
worksheets.
Based on our individual and group analysis of the worksheets, we came away with
four major principles or goals for the space:
(1) This is a noisy space. Many students asked for collaborative space where they
could meet and design together in an environment where they were free to spread
out, make a mess and discuss. Key to this was space arrangement. For example, a
central work table or “commons” was present in many of the submitted worksheets
and the group agreed this was indicative of a need for a collaborative and collegial
environment as opposed to a space for quiet, self-directed study. Other key indicators
were calls for programming or curriculum and an active or populated space.
(2) This is a welcoming space. Eight of the submitted worksheets included aspects
or elements designed to either extend the space out into the wider Faculty or
welcome members of that community into the space. For example, there were
requests for staff presence, open house hours, exhibit space, communication boards,
workshops, and a booking system.
(3) This is a creating space. This third goal speaks to specific requests for
equipment and tools geared towards building, designing, and creating across
disciplines. These requests ranged from three students drawing or including sewing
machines for cloth fabrication and wearable technology work to eight students

27

calling for a large whiteboard to work on collaborative design projects. Specific
technology or equipment requests included Arduino boards and sensors for civilian
tech initiatives, Raspberry Pi computers for exploration, a large monitor or HD
television for demo presentations, and 3D printing/scanning equipment.
(4) This is a dynamic space. This goal speaks to the diversity of the faculty and
their corresponding needs. It was reflected in the repeated call for a variety of
designated “stations” (e.g. a soldering station, a printing station, a workbench area,
a sewing station), but also the divide between students seeking a space for
collaborative design in traditionally screen-based environments (e.g. students
interested in UX and Systems Design) and those wanting to work on more material
or physical designs (e.g. Museum Studies students) (Whyte, About 307, 2016).
In creating the space, Che and I attempted to implement these goals and specific
programming and equipment requests. A central commons table comprised of six
movable tables anchors the space in the middle of the room. Fixed “stations” (e.g.
the Raspberry Pi station or the sewing station) ring the perimeter of the room.
Equipment in the space includes: projectors and screens; a serger; Makerbot 3D
scanner; two Makerbot 5th Gen 3D printers; a sewing machine; eight Arduino kits
with components; an iron and board; ten Raspberry Pi computers with components;
soldering stations; crafts supplies; fabric; wearables and wearable computing
supplies; and an all-purpose computer workstation.
Students participate in the space through regular drop-in hours or structured
curriculum in the form of workshops, lectures, and working groups or clubs
organized around common interests. For example, the space hosts regular
programming, such as the weekly 2-hr ‘Arduino Club’ (Error! Reference source
ot found.), and one-off events, like an evening discussion on game design (Error!
Reference source not found.).

Open hours were typically quieter than scheduled events or workshops, but most
days would see at least a few people popping by to say hello, maybe borrow a pair
of scissors, or work on a project. A typical week is shown here in Fig. 7:

4.2 Staff
As a paid work-study employee, I served as the on-site support for 8-10 drop-in or
open hours per week. I shared this role with Che, my co-worker. Together, we were
also responsible for scheduling, programming, inventory, maintaining the space,
administration, and applying for additional funding for things like consumable
equipment.

30

4.3 People
In a graduate faculty of approximately 600 Masters students, there were over 300
unique visits to Studio307 last year, spread across an estimated 200 students.1 While
all of these students play a role in this work, I tend to focus on just eight in this work.
They are:
Mel: Mel is a second-year Library and Archives student and is a regular at
Studio307. She often uses the space to do school work, but also stops by for a
creative break. In an afternoon, Mel might spend an hour on her thesis (a critical and
analytical bibliography of a Japanese text) and then stop and sew up a pencil case or
print a phone stand on the 3D printer. Mel is also a regular member of Arduino Club,
coming most weeks to put together circuits and code, and often a helper for students
new to the space. She described her time in the space as a departure from her school
work. While we never officially collaborated, Mel and I spent many afternoons
working quietly alongside one another.
Jake: Jake is a second-year Information Systems and Design student. He came to
the Faculty because he wanted to improve his technical skills. While not a regular,
Jake uses the space for class-assigned group work and attends occasional workshops
or talks in the space. Jake was also involved with Studio307 from its earliest days,
when it was just an idea.
Jude: Jude is a first-year Information Systems and Design student with a
background working in libraries and as a former professional ballet dancer. Jude is
considering continuing working in libraries, but is still open to other career paths.

31

Jude first came to Studio307 as a way to meet people and often dropped in for
Arduino Club, to chat, or to borrow supplies.
Swapnil: Swapnil, a second-year Information Systems and Design student from a
Computer Science background, is another regular. He often drops in to say hello,
sometimes stays to do course work, and usually ends up getting roped into various
projects or activities happening in the space. Whether I was moving chairs or
rewiring the tables, Swapnil was often there to help. This relationship eventually
formalized when what started as people dropping by the space to ask Swapnil for
help with programming questions blossomed into a regular, weekly drop-in Python
session.
Che: Che is my co-worker, a fellow director of the space. She is a second-year
Library and Information Science student with a sciences background. Che is vibrant,
and she brings people to the space. She often fires off tweets saying, ‘come on
down,’ texts friends, or even calls out to people in the hall. She has one of those
magnetic personalities, an element that was crucial to the space’s success.
Pauline: Pauline is a first-year Book History and Print Culture major. She formerly
worked as a photographer taking product pictures for book dealers and antiquarians
and wanted to merge those skills with her studies at the Faculty of Information. She
came to Studio307 to try her hand at 3D scanning a uniquely bound book in order to
explore digitization of material artifacts.
Sonya: Sonya is a first-year student in User Experience Design. She first came to
the space with Tom for Arduino Club as a way to meet people, but also to practice
some of the skills they were learning in classes, like programming and physical
computing. Sonya regularly called herself a technical newbie, and yet she corrected
my code a few times.

32

Tom: Tom is a former Music major and first-year student in Culture & Technology
who first came to the Faculty because he wanted a program that was both practical
and abstract. Tom is a dabbler who seems to try his hand at everything. Tom also
has key-fob access to the space and spends a lot of time exploring and trying new
things outside of regular hours.
There are others, and I will introduce new students as they appear, but these eight
represent the bulk of this work. In the next chapter, I will delve further into my
findings with an exploration of how students discovered Studio307.

33

By Invitation Only
In this chapter, I explore how students first discovered Studio307 and the role
personal relationships played in encouraging them to enter and continue
participating.
Most students discovered Studio307 through a face-to-face invitation. For example,
they were given a tour during their Faculty orientation, we spoke to their class, they
knew Che or I, or a professor encouraged them to visit. Here, we see how a
professor’s encouragement and a reason for being there are what inspire Pauline to
enter the space to use the 3D scanner:
Pauline: I had talked to Professor Galey, and he initially was
going to send me up there [to Semaphore’s main lab], but then
they sent me down here [to 307]…He mentioned, ‘Have you
contacted the Semaphore?’ and I said I wasn't sure who exactly
to contact there. So, he was gonna introduce me to them. But then
he came back to me and told me to come here.
I want to draw attention to how, despite our well-meaning website indicating we had
a 3D scanner or our email blasts to students and faculty saying all were welcome,
Pauline went first to someone she knew – her professor. It was rare to get students
just dropping in without a purpose, like attending a workshop, or a personal
introduction. Almost everyone I interviewed first came because they were invited.
The only two who did not, Sonya and Tom, came together and even their decision
to participate was dependent on existing programming and still supported by another
person.

34

The personal relationship and invitation not only helped students discover and feel
comfortable entering Studio307, but also, depending on the level of that relationship,
led to increased and deeper participation. Here, Jake and I discuss his early
involvement in the space as a member of TechFund (the student fund that partially
supported the space) and as an early participant in the community consultation
process that helped define and design Studio307:
Jess: Did you tell me why you first came to Studio307? You just
wanted to get more involved?
Jake: Well, you told me about it. I guess I'm not the best person
to ask because I knew about 307 before it was 307 and stuff.
Jess: Yeah. It was just floating around then.
Jake: And I drew like what I thought the space should look like
and did those forms and stuff. So, I've always been pretty keen
on it. And, so actually, when I did a tour for incoming students,
I brought them in here and raved about it, I was trying to build
excitement.
What I am interested in here is Jake’s affinity for the space because of that early
invitation and the level of his subsequent involvement. This affinity might be rooted
in subject interest, but it is also cultivated by Jake’s early participation in decisions
concerning Studio307’s funding and drawing out what he thought the space should
look like as part of the community consultation. This enthusiasm even results in
more invitations when Jake brings in students new to the space. If Pauline, as
someone who only came once to do a specific and low-risk task, is what Lave and
Wenger would call a peripheral participant, then Jake is a full member, a
consequence of that early introduction and “being included in what matters”
(Wenger, 1998, p. 74). Because access is not always a choice and is often determined
by the existing community, these invitations and inclusions matter. According to
Bethan Davies, “Individuals do not have open access to communities based solely

35

on their desire to be part of that community and to take part in its practices” (2005).
In other words, an open door or a website is not enough, and an invitation, or what
Lave and Wenger refer to as an offer of legitimacy, must be obtained or granted. In
Jake’s case, I was the existing community and I invited him in early. He was included
in what matters. For Pauline though, the invitation came indirectly, and while I hope
we were welcoming and helpful, I wonder if a more personal action, like a followup email, might have encouraged her to stay involved.
There was also confusion about how students could achieve deeper involvement in
Studio307 and this is because membership was not particularly organized and the
organizational structure of the space was not always transparent. We had clear
requirements for entry (you must be a part of the Faculty of Information at the
University of Toronto), a variety of entry points (e.g. workshops, open hours, clubs),
and outreach (e.g. a website, class visits, tours), but the process for how a person
might move from the periphery to the core was not always clear. These levels of
membership, core and peripheral, developed organically and were not considered or
included in the original plans for the space. For example, 24-hr key fob access was
available to students outside of open hours, but it was not automatic, it was granted.
In this example, I talk to Sonya, a regular participant in the space, about what fob
access meant to her:
Sonya: Knowing that I could come in to, like, use the space I felt
very comfortable and I brought my critical making group in here
to work on stuff 'cause we had access to the Arduino pieces, right,
and that made me feel like I knew what I was, I don't know, that
I could bring other people here I guess, [chuckle] to use it.
Jess: If you were master of the iSchool [Faculty of Information],
would you make fob access available to everyone or on a
requested basis?

36

Sonya: Yeah, if I were master of the iSchool I think I'd make a
fob access granted on request. And it's, like, known that you can
make a request for that, because I actually wasn’t sure.
What is notable here is Sonya’s remark that it should be known fob access was
available (implying it was not widely known) and her apprehensiveness about
whether she should ask about it. Sonya was not the only student who remarked on
the vagueness of fob access. In this excerpt, Jude and I talk about his experience
using the room after-hours for a group project when one of his group members, Tom,
had fob access:
Jude: Tom comes here a lot, and I guess he knew the room would
be free. And, I guess we were trying to find a free space 'cause it
was in the project week and I think we stayed here pretty late.
Jess: Did you know fob access was possible?
Jude: No, I didn't. But that makes sense, 'cause we were
struggling to find a space.
The point I want to emphasize here is that the boundaries were not always clear.
Sonya was not sure if she was allowed to ask for fob access to work on her projects
and Jude did not even know it was possible. Access had to be asked for and, because
it was not advertised, it was more likely to be offered by staff than requested by
students. If I consider core or regular members as those with fob access, then it was
not clear to someone on the periphery or outside how they might obtain that level of
membership. You had to be “in the know” to know it was possible or feel
comfortable asking.
Because this stratification of involvement and its dependence on personal
relationships happened as we went, we (Che and I) were not aware of it as a barrier.
It is only upon reflection that I see these relationships as both an asset (as an
invitation) and a barrier (as an unclear process). Harkening back to Lave and

37

Wenger’s concepts of reification and participation, a balance or harmony must be
struck between the two. If space is structured by a variety of social relations and the
product of interrelations (Massey, 2005: 9), then a student staff member provides
peer support that extends beyond technical support or safety training (Forest et al.,
2014). A staff member can literally welcome someone to the space and, as I found,
this is a crucial catalyst for bringing new students into the space. As one student said
during the community consultation process, “just having someone to say ‘hello’ is
so important.” But, perhaps only relying on these relationships did us a disservice as
well. In this instance, Studio307 and I relied too heavily on participation to
determine how students discovered the space and subsequently deepened their level
of involvement. The consequence of this was that we ended up with tiers of
membership that were undefined, mysterious, and subsequently served as a barrier
for some students. Some reification or formalization in this case may have changed
how students approached or used the space.
In short, students discovered Studio307 through personal relationships and their
level of involvement depended on the depth of that relationship. When an invitation
was not extended, the first introduction was often via a workshop or event and
unsolicited visits were rare. Because the depth of student involvement was so
dependent on personal relationships and we failed to proactively organize tiers of
membership, we ended up with an opaque structure that may have deterred some
students.
In the next chapter, I will explore one of the main motivations for why students came
to Studio307.

38

Technical Anxiety
In the last chapter, we explored how students discovered and became involved with
Studio307. In this chapter, we will examine a reason students first came to the space,
a single motivation. There are, of course, many individual reasons for coming, but
here I want to focus on a common one – technical anxiety. I considered titling this
chapter technical excitement because I worried about the negative connotations of
the word anxiety. I want to clarify that the definition of anxiety that I am using is an
adaptation of a “strong desire or concern for something to happen or to do
something” ( "anxiety, n." OED Online, 2017) that includes an accompanying sense
of nervousness and anticipation. The “something to happen or do” here is the
development of an increased understanding of technology. To clarify, I am using
technical anxiety to mean an eager, but tense desire to increase one’s technical
capacity. This chapter starts with an exploration of students’ uncertainty about their
technical capacity in general and how that relates to why they initially enrolled in
the Faculty of Information. I then move to the similarities between their reasons for
enrollment and their motivations for coming to Studio307. Then, we look at how
that same apprehension either encouraged students to, or kept them from, exploring
certain technologies in the space. Finally, I end with a discussion on possible sources
of that initial anxiety.
Most of the students I interviewed (9 out of 10) came from humanities undergraduate
programs, and many enrolled in the Faculty of Information because they were
seeking a graduate degree with a technical or practical component. This was often
linked to concerns about finding a career or how to apply an arts degree in the job

39

market. In this excerpt, Jake explains his expectations when he enrolled in his initial
program (Information Systems and Design), his apprehensions, and his experience:
Jake: I felt that I'd come into this program really thinking it
would be technically focused, especially because I went into ISD
[Information Systems and Design] and I was ready to be
unprepared and really overwhelmed by the technical
requirements, but I was excited for it, too. But when I came in, I
was completely underwhelmed by the technical requirements
and how much I could possibly learn. And I felt like a big reason
I'd come to the iSchool was…well, I felt I'd be dealing with data
and information and learning these skills. So, there's a real
gesture here to say, like, "Don't worry about the technology,"
like, "Don't worry about this technical stuff, you don't need to
know it." And my feeling is you do need to know it to some
degree, or else you're gonna have to learn it on the job in your
careers now. It's inevitable that you're gonna have to know some
technology.
I heard a similar story from Tom, a music major in his undergrad, when he explained
why he chose his first concentration in Information Systems and Design:
Tom: I knew I didn’t want to do something with music, but I had
spent a lot of time in undergrad messing around with computers
and so I thought that I might want to do something IT-related,
but I obviously didn't have a computer science degree. So, when
I was looking at doing grad school, I found this program and I
heard that it was general, and it was more about the abstract,
administration style of that, I was interested in coming here. And
then I felt like that was the one [Information Systems and
Design] that was more geared towards doing that kind of
practical, hands-on stuff. Yeah, that's how I ended up here.
Tom, who was drawn to the “abstract, administration style” of his program does not
express the same disappointment in the technical depth of his education as Jake, but

40

both tell a story about wanting to do “something IT-related” or “technically
focused.” It was a vague but common undercurrent for most students outside of the
more traditional Library and Information Science, Museum Studies, or Archives and
Records Management streams. There was Sonya who did her undergraduate studies
in global development and art history and was “really concerned about getting a
career instead of being in an academic institution,” or Mary, a psychology and
business undergrad, who wanted “a good way to facilitate my background into UX
and something more technical.” The only people I interviewed who did not explicitly
express interest in increasing their technical capacity were Swapnil, a student with a
computer science undergraduate degree who came to the Faculty to develop his
project management and client communication skills; Jude, who came from a library
background; and Naomi, a library student interested in working in the public library
sector.
Similarly to why they enrolled in the Faculty, students often came to Studio307
because they wanted to increase their technical capacity. Here, Sonya tells me one
of the reasons she first got involved in the space:
Sonya: I was also just curious, I knew that you could make things
in here and I love dabbling in different things, so I wanted to see
what I could try. I also had... well, for a long time I was really
scared of anything that was technology. [chuckle] And about a
year ago maybe I took an intro to HTML, just something superbasic, but it brought down the barrier a little bit so I wanted to try
and dabble in a whole bunch of different things, and it made it
feel like it was possible. You can try something without it being
really intense and it doesn't have to be scary. So, I wanted to keep
trying different things that before I would have just pushed away
as, "Oh I can't do that."

41

There is an eagerness in what Sonya is saying - an excitement fueled by curiosity,
but also a touch of fear. In the next chapter, we will hear Sonya tell us that she still
thinks of “anything that’s thought of as technical or techy” as “a new world,” and
yet, we see her here as embracing that new world - curious, dabbling, and wanting
to try different things. Tom, who first came to the space with Sonya, also told me
they “thought that this would be a good place to try and become more familiar with
the coding and actually putting things together.” Tom and Sonya, two of the most
active members of Studio307 and regular participants in Arduino Club, are an
example of technical anxiety encouraging action and exploration, but the theme was
common. Students usually came because they wanted to learn something new, try a
tool they had never used or, like Myrna, find “an environment where [they] could
comfortably start.” In hindsight, I wish I had interviewed students who never came
to Studio307. I, unfortunately, do not know why they did not come. Perhaps it was
a lack of interest or time, but it would be interesting to find out if fear contributed.
Here, Jude speculates on why he thinks some of his friends did not come to the space:
Jude: I have friends in other concentrations as well, and I think
they'll be a bit more hesitant to come, 'cause I think it has to do
with this idea that it's technological, and therefore it's
intimidating. So, in my concentration I can see any number of
people that I know willing to come here. But, let's say Archives
or something, I think they would say, "Oh, I don't wanna...," I
think they would say, "I don't know any of that stuff."
I think it is important to recognize that I am unable to generalize about why students
did not come to the space, but Jude’s remarks provide us with a clue that it was
perhaps due to hesitation or the idea that students felt they needed previous
experience or knowledge before entering the space. In their work at the Invention
Studio at Georgia Tech, Alexis Noel, Lauren Murphy and Amit Jariwala identified
four main barriers to entry for students: “anxiety due to lack of experience, a lack of

42

information regarding equipment and usage, a fear of alienation, and a pre-existing
notion that makerspaces are only for engineering” (2016). As evidenced by this
chapter, I, too, found that anxiety due to a lack of experience was a barrier, but am
only able to discuss it as a barrier once students had already entered the space.
Once students were in the space, the nervousness that accompanies technical anxiety
also discouraged some from trying new things. In this excerpt, Jude is explaining
why he never tried using the 3D printers:
Jude: I personally find the 3D printers a little intimidating, like,
I don’t wanna use it and break it, cause 3D printers, I know
they’re expensive. So, I personally wouldn’t go make something
on it, unless I had someone there like yourself. I’m actually
scared to break it.
Pauline, a Book History and Print Culture student and photographer, gives a similarsounding answer when I ask her why she has not tried exploring any of the physical
computing tools like the Arduinos or Raspberry Pi computers:
Pauline: It just seems overwhelming. It gets way beyond my
comfort level. I can’t even get past HTML coding. Scanning is
one thing, I know photography and that world, but that stuff,
coding, it just seems outside of anything I’ve ever done.
The words intimidating and overwhelming came up frequently in my interviews.
Students, like Jude, were afraid they might break something or, like Pauline, just felt
unsure of where to begin or start. Students were both motivated to come to this
faculty and Studio307 by the same technical anxiety that kept some from trying
certain tools or equipment. Fear served as both a motivator and a hindrance. I
observed, at the tool level, students avoiding trying something because they do not
want to break it or find it overwhelming. Or, like Pauline, trying it anyway because
of a perceived need. At the space level, I observed students coming or not coming

43

because of concerns about their technical capacity. At the faculty level, I observed
another connection between technical anxiety and why they enrolled in their
programs. Given these scales, how can this be reframed in order to understand what
causes that anxiety on a global level?
While this ethnography focuses on a local space, external factors still influenced the
local happenings at Studio307, specifically students’ motivations for engaging with
and in the space. These external factors reached in and out of the space. According
to Massey, because we can think about space as a product of our relations and
connections, we can consider how far those connections and relations extend
(Massey, 1994). I am reminded of those external factors and their impact when I
look at our Faculty’s website, see the recruitment banner shouting “Our highly
interconnected information-based society requires innovative, collaborative and
knowledgeable information professionals,” and then warning us that “today’s
technologies have transformed the way we connect with, shape and use information”
(Future Students, 2017). Here, we have this little space, a small room tucked away
on a university campus, and it may seem insulated and like its reach is insignificant.
But, if we consider space the way Massey does, as a product of our connections and
power relations, it helps us understand how Studio307 fits in with students’
reinforced concerns about the job market and changing economies. Fears, fueled by
our own Faculty, about a job market where, as Jake says, “it's inevitable that you're
gonna have to know some technology,” often drove technical anxiety. That same
technical anxiety fed into why they enrolled in their program, fed into why they came
or did not come to Studio307, and even fed into how they used the space.
Technical anxiety influences motivations and decisions, but it is not the only
catalyst. There were other reasons for coming to Studio307 - like Jude wanting to
meet new people or Naomi wanting to learn how to use the sewing machine. There

44

were also overlaps, like Sonya wanting to both increase her technical capacity and
simply enjoy the process of making and dabbling. But here, in this chapter, I focused
on one common motivation that appeared frequently and at multiple levels or scales
– technical anxiety.
In the next chapter, I explore how students preferred to use and participate in the
space once there.

45

Needing Context to Imagine
In this chapter, I explore the role inspiration plays in how students use the space, and
the balance between structuring that inspiration and allowing for autonomy. I also
discuss the tension between students wanting guidance or structured support, but
also valuing freedom or privacy and how room can be made for both.
Before students discovered a new tool or capability, they needed inspiration. Some
tools in Studio307 went untouched (for the entirety of my research period) and when
I probed students about why they did not try a particular piece of equipment, the
answer was, as we saw earlier, related to technical anxiety (not knowing how a tool
might be used), but also often tied to a lack of inspiration or context (not knowing
what it might be used for). The following excerpt is from a discussion with Sonya
about how she might improve the space:
Sonya: Something that I had difficulty with, was I wasn't sure
how to make use of certain things, or what everything was,
necessarily. …Like that Makey Makey, I never would've
discovered that myself. Or the soldering wands…? Iron?
[chuckle] Whatever it is. I have no idea what I would use that for.
It's cool that it's here, but I just don't know what to do with
something like that, [chuckle] and I think that's true for maybe
like the Raspberry Pi as well. I just don't know...I don't have
enough context to imagine what I could do with it, I guess. At
least with the 3D printers, I'd heard of Thingiverse before. And
to just be able to browse through things that people have done
before, I found gave me enough [inspiration] to be, like, "Oh
yeah, that would actually be a really cool thing to have. I never
would've imagined that’s something that you would do.” And

46

then once I had that I was like, "Okay, well I can build off of
this," and it helps you imagine other things, other ways of
approaching the same thing.
What I want to draw attention to in this excerpt is the significant role inspiration
plays in Sonya’s discovery. Sonya says she “wasn’t sure what kinds of things you
might do with stuff I wasn’t already familiar with” and refers to the Makey Makey
(a kit that allows people to connect everyday items, like a banana, to a computer and
use them as controllers), which we demonstrated one day at Arduino Club. She also
cites Thingiverse, a website where people share their designs for 3D prints or laser
cuts, and says she can build off that existing work because it helps her imagine other
things she can do. In previous work, I recommended making items visible as a way
of supporting discovery (Whyte, 2016), but simply leaving an item out on a table or
listing it on a website might not be enough. Even once a student has overcome
technical anxiety, visibility is not enough – often, inspiration and context are also
needed.
To further contextualize the use of tools, the addition of inspiration alone was also
not enough - often that inspiration needed to be structured or guided, as in a
workshop or organized event. In the following excerpt, Jake and I discuss how he
used Studio307 over the year and delve into why he regretted not coming to a
Halloween costume-making party:
Jake: I really wanted to do the Halloween costume thing here,
because I would love to learn how to use a sewing machine. …I
guess, for me, it's also, well, there was something about the
making, like, a costume thing, a sewing machine thing, where I
was like, I don't have to invent my own project so much. Which
is something that...Well, going back to my Raspberry Pi idea,
that is, to have the context already helps me, I think, in terms of
thinking about what I wanna do.

47

The point I want to emphasize here is that Jake is also stressing the importance of
inspiration, but using it to explain the appeal of workshops. By attending a workshop
or event, like the Halloween costume-making party, Jake does not “have to invent”
his own project. He is instead free to simply learn or discover the equipment without
the additional pressure of first having to come up with an original project or idea.
Looking through the staff logs, attendance would naturally spike on days with
programming, and future, independent usage of specific materials was also tied to
programming. For example, the Raspberry Pi computers went untouched until a Pi
workshop was held in February and then they were subsequently pulled out,
borrowed, and experimented with on multiple occasions. On a less uplifting note,
the Dremel, a multi-purpose rotary tool, was not featured in any workshops and still
sits fresh in its box.
Structuring a workshop around a prescriptive task may seem rigid or repressive.
There is an underlying libertarian ethos in sectors of maker culture that focuses
heavily on tinkering and independent discovery (Toombs, Bardzell, & Bardzell,
2014; 2015; Kostakis, Niaros, & Giotitsas, 2014; Van Holm, 2014) and enforcing
too much structure or dictating use might be seen as running counter to those ideas
of open discovery and free exploration. However, Studio307 is not a hackerspace, a
madlab, or a DIY makerspace. It is a studio in an academic institution backed by
curricular intentions. Students are not necessarily there to sign on to DIY culture and
they are not always walking in as experienced makers.
Providing too much structure (e.g. “in this workshop, we will be making this object”)
may also seem counter to makerspace ideals like peer-to-peer or informal learning
(Britton, 2012; Colegrove, 2013). That is, instead of learning through shared interest
or creating with peers, structured workshops are seen as too unidirectional or reified.
In her discourse analysis of makerspaces and libraries, Willet (2016) points out how

48

simplifying these polarizations between informal and formal learning can be. She
remarks that there is space for multiple forms or styles of learning and opportunities
to blend them together. I found that structured programming, despite being
prescriptive, was not only welcome, but it also supported discovery and future,
independent work. Like Willet, I agree that there is space for both formal and
informal learning and both forms not only support student objectives, but are needed.
In Studio307, students wanted both that structured support but also freedom to
explore. On one hand, students welcomed the staff presence and structure discussed
above, but they also wanted the freedom to make mistakes without being supervised.
In the remainder of this chapter, I will discuss that tension and some reflections on
my own anxieties around discerning whether that help was welcome.
When I asked interviewees to describe Studio307 to an imaginary incoming student,
they often mentioned how there was staff available. In these excerpts, I ask Jude and
Pauline to do just that - to explain the space to me as if I am a new student:
Jude: I would tell them it's like a collaborative hub space where
it's free for you to use as a student here. You can come by and
just make something. There's usually a really nice person there
teaching you how to do stuff. But I also know that it's a free
space, so whenever you wanna create something, do something
with whatever, you can…it's free space, safe space. Yeah, I
would tell them that.
Pauline: It's like a creative workshop where depending on your
project, there's available tools and support to work on your
project. It's just a really good space to work in and do your thing.
Just because, I can imagine like, if I'm over here working, say on
the 3D printer and I need help with it or I even just want info like,
"Hey, what do you think? How do you think this looks?" Or say,

49

try and problem-solve. It's good to have other people to talk to
versus working alone.
There are two aspects of these excerpts which are important. One is how both Jude
and Pauline include the availability of support in their description of Studio307.
They highlight it as a feature. Perhaps this is because they are talking to me, someone
who worked in the space, and are being polite by acknowledging my work. But I
think the support is sincerely valued because both also explain why they like having
someone there. For Jude, the value of another person is to teach or support, and for
Pauline, it is to collaborate or bounce ideas around. However, the second aspect in
these excerpts is the description of the space as “free” and “creative.” It is not as
explicit, but there is a subtext there, that this is a free space to experiment and explore
and students are not beholden to a particular curriculum or the expectations of others.
This hints at Goffman’s theories about face and embarrassment, which I will turn to
soon, and why people may want to learn or have new experiences free from the
watchful eyes of others.
Freedom from observation was a catalyst for some students, encouraging them to try
new things, make a mess, or take ownership of Studio307. Here, Swapnil is
explaining why he wanted to use Studio307 for a group project and compares the
space to the Inforum (our Faculty library), using oversight as the benchmark:
Swapnil: I was with my team for our critical making course and
we're building so many things, we're doing crafting, we don't
want to make a mess in the Inforum space. Because again, the
clearing that mess and it's like there are always people just
watching what you're doing, and you're walking in and out all the
whole time and everyone is looking. Over here, you have all the
equipment that you want, your scissors, you have glue. Whatever
you want, it's right here, so it would have been so much easier.

50

It is noteworthy how Swapnil twice mentions watchful eyes as a deterrent. He wants
to make a mess away from “people just watching what you’re doing” and be free to
move around without everyone “looking.” He was not the only one. When talking
about ownership of the space, Tom told me he felt better looking for tucked away
tools when he was alone because “it feels different if the door is open and people are
watching or whatever.” Tom then told me about his time alone in the space, trying
to repair a set of headphones with the soldering iron while he waited for a print job
to finish or learning how to fix a filament break on the 3D printer on his own, and I
wonder if those things would have happened had I or Che been there. For Tom and
Swapnil, a lack of supervision translated to ownership and a willingness to do more.
In other words, a lack of supervision also translated to inspiration. I understand this
contrasts with my earlier finding that context and support lead to inspiration, but
there is room for both.
Returning to Willet’s discourse analysis (2016), she warns about oversimplification
in the makerspace literature. Willet is discussing how authors like Britton (2012) or
Colegrove (2013) seem to vaunt informal learning without questioning who that
might benefit or exclude, or appear to assume social and collaborative learning
always trumps individual effort. As it applies to freedom and structure, this is not
always simple. Many of Studio307’s participants have never met and their
motivations, expectations, and outcomes are not universal. This is an example of
there being moments where support or inspiration are needed and others where a
supervisory eye is too prescriptive or restrictive. There is a need for structure and
guidance, but also for free space and time to explore and try out new things. These
things do not have to conflict with each other. They can complement and overlap
and do.

51

For some students though, valuing freedom or privacy while working in Studio307
was less about enabling action and more about reducing risk or embarrassment.
Earlier, we saw how Pauline highlighted the availability of other people as collegial
and supportive (“it's good to have other people to talk to versus working alone”).
But, as we kept talking and I asked Pauline if she thought she might use Studio307
more if she had 24-hour access, she touched on what she saw as the downside of
having other people around:
Pauline: Yeah, well, ‘cause it can be intimidating as well. If you
don't know necessarily what you're doing and you don't want
everyone being like, "Oh, she doesn't know what she's doing."
The point I want to extract here is how Pauline wants to avoid perceived
embarrassment or judgement. Considering that the students who use Studio307 are
all peers and adults, I would like to think it is unlikely anyone would ever remark or
think “oh, she does not know what she’s doing,” but the threat is real to Pauline.
According to Goffman, embarrassment is all about unfulfilled expectations and if a
person does not possess the attributes, information, or capacities they are expected
to possess, that is what causes embarrassment (1967, p. 105). Where Goffman does
not go is clarifying whose expectations. In this case, my expectation that no
experience is required does not match Pauline`s expectation where she believes she
should know what she is doing. When Pauline told me she thought Studio307 could
be intimidating, I realized we did not make it clear what our expectations of new
users were. We, the staff at Studio307, did not work hard enough to make people
feel comfortable about their skills. There are no signs on the wall that say things like
“Everyone is a Beginner” or “Step 1: Fail.” There is no automatic precursor to every
workshop like “there are no silly questions,” and other than the line “no experience
required” on our Arduino Club ads, there is little documentation available on what,
if any, expertise is needed.

52

To understand this shortcoming, we can also return to Wenger’s concepts of
participation and reification. According to Wenger (1998), participation is how
members interact and through those interactions develop norms and expectations,
and reification is the use of artefacts like policies, curriculums, or posters on the wall
to affect how members behave. In other words, reification is taking something
abstract (e.g. a concept like all are welcome) and turning it into a thing (e.g. a sign
on the door that says, “all are welcome”). While participation and reification do exist
in a tension-relationship, they are not in opposition. Instead, they are meant to
complement one another. If there is too much reliance on participation, the
community and space are unanchored. People do not know what the expectations
are and develop their own diverging versions. If reification prevails, you stifle your
community and that freedom to explore or take ownership is smothered. In this
instance, with Pauline and possibly others, the scales were tipped towards
participation. We left too much not reified or formalized, like our intent that this was
a welcoming space and that no experience was required.
These worries about structure leading to stifling or observation leading to
embarrassment did not only exist for students, I also found myself wrestling with
this as a staff member and provider of that support. On one of my first days, a student
came in and asked if Studio307 was available to use outside of open hours. I replied,
“no, not yet” and she remarked how she preferred to work “without someone looking
over my shoulder.” That stuck with me and I became sensitive to it. In my field
notes, I often worried about whether I was imposing on people or forcing unsolicited
help on them. This excerpt, from three months in, captures that anxiety well:
Field Notes (Dec, 2016): I spent most of my time fluttering
between Kelly and Jude, trying to strike a balance between
helping and hovering. This, I think, is the hardest part of this job
- you worry that people aren’t asking for help because maybe

53

they’re nervous, shy or worried they’re bothering you, so you go
over to have a look and maybe offer a suggestion, but then you
start worrying that you’re a helicopter or drone annoyingly
buzzing overhead and forcing them to tackle their project your
way. I found myself repeating phrases like, “if you already know
this, please stop me” when explaining something or “let me know
if I’m in your way,” and also doing awkward things like never
touching their work and trying to offer explanations verbally, not
physically. It’s awkward.
This excerpt illustrates how, early on, I had my own concerns about how to gauge
what level of support to offer and whether my presence might make others nervous
or smother their creativity, initiative, or agency. If I am to trust Stanley and Wise
(1993), these kinds of emotional responses are sensitizing guide dogs. This anxiety
serves an interpretive function as an important source of insight. If I am worrying
about being in other people’s way, maybe they are, too, and it is worth exploring.
For that reason, I opted to seek out this theme in my notes and transcripts.
In this chapter, I explored how inspiration and support can serve as a catalyst for
discovery once students were in the space, but also the balance that must be struck
between helping and hovering in order to allow for individual exploration. Specific
tools or equipment often went untouched in Studio307 when students did not know
how an item might be used, or what it might be used for. Students also appreciated
when that inspiration was structured. Guidance, whether in the form of inspirational
examples, workshops, or individual staff assistance, often led to increased use.
However, this was not universal, even amongst individuals, and despite appreciating
help, students also wanted privacy or freedom to explore on their own. This freedom
provided room for students to try new things and freedom to fail away from watchful
eyes or without risk of judgement. In Chapter 10 – Conclusions and

54

Recommendations, I will discuss how this balance between support and freedom
might be achieved.
In the next chapter, I will return to participation and reification again. This time, to
explore how diverging versions or interpretations of Studio307 effected how, or if,
students used the space.

55

Peripheral to the Institution
For some students, their activities in Studio307 were co-curricular, that is, meant to
complement or support in-class learning experiences. For others, it was also extracurricular, that is, outside of the realm of normal curriculum and motivated by
personal experience and interest. This sometimes led to confusion over what was
allowed or what was considered a valuable pursuit and whether that mattered. In this
chapter, I explore how students saw the space as peripheral and the subsequent
confusion over whether it was co- or extra-curricular or both. Then I delve into how,
despite wanting to encourage both uses, I, as a staff member at Studio307,
inadvertently privileged one over the other and the consequences of that privileging.
Despite being physically situated within the Faculty of Information at the University
of Toronto and operating under the banner and management of the Semaphore
Research Cluster, students often thought of Studio307 as peripheral to the institution.
One example is how they compared it to another student space, one more internal
and institutionally managed: the Inforum (the Faculty library). Here, I am asking
Mary about how she would explain Studio307 to new students:
Jess: What if they asked, like, "So, why is this space here?"
Mary: Why I think this space exists?
Jess: Yeah.
Mary: Well, I think this space exists so that students can come
together to work, kind of like the Inforum, but a little bit more
personal-like and casual, and people come and go, and they meet
new people, and they can also do cool things like work on
Arduinos, get involved in more technology-based products just

56

like software engineering as a whole, and get exposed to that tech
field.
Mary is describing the space as like the Inforum in that it is a work space for students,
but she differentiates it. She describes it as more personal and ad-hoc with people
coming and going. People come and go at the Inforum, too, of course, but the sense
here is that 307 is less structured. I asked Swapnil a similar question and he took the
comparison between the Inforum and Studio307 further:
Swapnil: I would just say to them that, ‘If you're doing any craft
work, anything craft related, rather than using Inforum, come
down here. You have all the equipment that you would
need…But yeah, you could use this rather than the Inforum and
there's no time limit over here. You could just come. If this is
open, you don't have to book anything compared to...’
Jess: …like, a meeting room?
Swapnil: Yeah, I mean, as of now, as it stands now, I would say
like, ‘You don't have to book anything. Policies could change, I
understand, but you have equipment. So, if you're creating
things, if you're looking to be...[trails off]. If you're trying to do
a personal project, also, it doesn’t have to be a school project. …
Feel free to use it for whatever purpose that you want.
There are two things I want to focus on here. The first is that Swapnil, like Mary,
juxtaposes Studio307 with the Inforum. He distinguishes it from the Inforum in three
ways: you can make a mess here, you do not need to book the space, and you can
work on personal projects. Again, these things can happen in the Inforum - it is a
fairly laid back place designated for students - but there is a perception that the
Inforum is for coursework or traditional desk work and perhaps a little more rigid,
whereas Studio307 is for other types of work, less formally dictated by institutional
regulations, and away from institutional oversight. Returning to the language of
Wenger’s community of practice, the Inforum is described by students as

57

institutional and reified, while Studio307 is described as unstructured and defined
by participation (2008). The second thing I want to recognize from Swapnil’s
description is the emphasis he places on personal endeavors and how students should
“feel free to use it [Studio307] for whatever purpose” they want. This indicated to
me that there may be differing views on the purpose of the space.
Students were confused as to Studio307’s status, they saw it as both co-curricular
and extra-curricular, sometimes simultaneously. They might link their work in
Studio307 to coursework, but then also describe what they did there as distinct or
different from traditional coursework. In this next excerpt, Jake explains why he had
not visited Studio307 as much in the Winter semester:
Jake: I almost feel that, like the classes get in the way of all of

the self-directed learning I'd like to do and all the things I'd like
to explore. So, I feel if there was just an open day to just play
around here, I'd have a blast.
Jess: What about your classes this semester? Is there anything
that this space might play into there?
Jake: So, last semester, I had all the kinda group projects, I had
Critical Making which fed really nicely into this. This next
semester is gonna be a lot of readings and papers, and that level
of classic academic engagements. I think this space might be a
sanity, or a kind of like, "I'm tired of writing, I'm tired of reading.
I wanna use my hands. I wanna have a tactile experience now."
And I think this will be a wonderful space for me for that.
Jake links Studio307 to his past coursework for Critical Making (a class that explores
critical themes in Information Studies through hands-on work and physical
computing), but plans to use the space this semester as “a sanity.” For him,
Studio307 will now be a counter, rather than a compliment, to what he calls “classic

58

academic engagements.” Pauline, a student who came to do 3D scanning for a class
project, does something similar:
Jess: If a student asked you about this space, how would you
answer if they asked, "Why does this Faculty have this space?"
Pauline: Well, thinking for LIS, libraries are kinda moving away
from just the traditional, like, "Here's a book." They're becoming
more involved in the community and they're having different
kind of programs and technologies available. And so, I feel it's
important for future librarians to kinda train, and know the
technology here, and to kinda be able to get really familiar with
it, and learn those skills. And so, I think that aspect helps, but
also, it just, especially for people like me, creative people, it's a
good outlet to do something different.
Pauline’s approach differs slightly from Jake’s. For her, Studio307 is a place to learn
career skills and do coursework (her 3D scanning project), but also a source of
creative release or expression and she combines the two. With Jake though, there is
a bit of a tension between what is personal and what is professional or academic, and
these aspects are divergent. I would hear things from students like their interest in
the space was “purely personal,” but then still see them at Arduino Club or weekly
Python tutorials applying in-class programming skills to personal projects or vice
versa. Or, like Raj, they might tell me they came to an Internet of Things workshop
“just because I thought it seemed fun, something to do,” but they would still
incorporate concepts from their Information Security courses in the in-workshop
discussions. There is a discordance there - people are saying one thing and doing
another - but this might be because people do not need to separate these things out
so markedly. There is an institutional desire to be able to point to an activity or
endeavor and clearly say how it links back to coursework or career skills, but it is
not always that clean. Being able to quantify or specifically identify examples of cocurricular learning examples is great for grant applications, but the students

59

themselves do not always define their work in such a demarcated way and trying to
force it can backfire. In the remainder of this chapter, I will explore how I, as a staff
member, attempted to do just that by privileging the co-curricular and the subsequent
consequences.
In failing to formally define Studio307 as co-curricular or otherwise, the space
suffered some consequences in terms of use. For example, Studio307 may be
peripheral to the institution but its proximity often led to confusion or hesitations
around how it could be used. In this field notes excerpt, I recount a conversation with
a student who was running a series of 3D printing workshops in the space:
Field Notes (Jan, 2017): Cal stopped by to check on supplies for
his upcoming workshop, make sure everything was ready to go
and all that. Something interesting went down, I just happened to
mention a couple of students were printing out custom game
pieces for a Settlers of Catan game and he balked. He said that
could eat up a lot of filament and I said, ‘okay,’ and then he
replied, ‘well, as long as you don’t mind if people are just
printing trinkets.’ And then, then we got into it, but in a friendly
way. I asked him what he thought they should be printing?
Perhaps, pre-approved, blank ‘Cal Circles’ or utili-cubes? I
joked that perhaps he’d like to start up a screening service to
approve every print job, make sure it’s up to his standards and all
that. He took it in stride and conceded, but it was still funny to
realize that people do have concerns about what’s valid or good
enough or, I don’t know, I guess, academic enough? We’re not
all on the same footing here.
My argument with Cal was that regardless of motivation (co- or extra-curricular),
students were still learning the limits and capabilities of the technology. Many of the
projects tackled in Studio307 were driven by personal interests, but the outcomes
were the same. Sonya and Tom may have first used the 3D printer to make a dry
pasta measuring tool and Swapnil may have tried his hand at a custom Settlers of

60

Catan game piece, but what they made does not really matter. They still learned to
level the build plate, load the filament, alter a design, test various fills, and operate
and troubleshoot the printer. They still learned the capabilities and limitations of that
technology.
Because this attitude that Studio307 did not differentiate between co- and extracurricular was not documented and because the space was still affiliated with the
institution, there was confusion amongst students. Some students, like Cal, saw the
space as strictly co-curricular. My field notes and the staff log are peppered with
entries like “a student came in to ask if it was okay if they worked on a personal
project” or, “she asked me if it was okay if she just tried the 3D printer for fun, or if
it had to be for a class.” When asked, Che and I always clarified that students were
free to work on whatever they wanted, but this was not documented in any signage
or publicized policies. We were competing with the attitude that the space was
strictly co-curricular (e.g. Cal), and it may have negatively affected use.
This confusion over extra- or co-curricular was aggravated by my own behavior.
When I spoke to classes to introduce them to the space, I would always try to provide
examples of how people used it for course projects. Or, when discussing Studio307
with a new administration staff member, I remember running methodically through
every concentration in our program and providing an example of how each might
use the space for a supposedly valid, co-curricular purpose (“UX students might use
it for rapid prototyping, Museum students for exhibit building…”). When Che and I
applied for funding, we would always back up our requests with rationale about how
this activity or that piece of equipment supported curricular goals. I even made a
display about how Museum Studies students might use the space focused entirely on
professional development. In doing so, I tacitly supported this idea that the space
was intended to be co-curricular. In her discourse analysis of the rhetoric around

61

public library makerspaces, Crawford Barniskis (2015) found a discordance between
the front-stage speak in the literature about makerspaces supporting economic goals
(e.g.

developing

technology skills

for

the

job

market

or

supporting

entrepreneurialism) and the backstage conversations between librarians which
tended to focus on things like open and equitable access to equipment or supporting
social and creative needs. She describes it as librarians simultaneously serving their
institutions, who are seeking funding and grants, and their users, who have different
goals, and warns that the consequence might be the foreclosure of activities deemed
“economically or educationally irrelevant.” I am guilty of this frontstage/backstage
behavior (Goffman, 1959). Regardless of whether I thought a project had to be
specifically educationally relevant (I did not), how I was participating was
contributing to that norm or expectation. Not only was I not clear that both co- and
extra-curricular activities were welcome, but I actually privileged the co-curricular.
At the Invention Studio at Georgia Tech, a student-run makerspace, they specifically
“welcome all types of projects, personal and professional” (Forest et al., 2014).
Forest et al. point out how unique this is and that many other institutional making
spaces do not allow the pursuit of non-academic projects. They also identify this as
a draw, a way to encourage long-term engagement, and recommend studying
whether it was “a personal project or required (class or research) project that caused
the user to first enter” because “how the shift occurred from ‘almost required’
participation to voluntary participation, that is, from school project to personal
exploration, is a compelling area for future studies.” I, too, find this compelling, but
based on what I saw at Studio307, I am not sure this demarcation is always possible.
Working on a specific course deliverable is easy to define but, outside of that, the
boundaries are not as clear. Students might say they are at a workshop because of
personal interest, but they are still tying in class concepts or taking those concepts
back to the classroom later.

62

Linking participation to curricular or career outcomes also has consequences. If
administrators keep heralding educational or economic impacts as the ideal on the
frontstage, a necessary tactic in an academic institution, you start to create an
expectation or a norm. Unless administrators and staff are diligent about balancing
this out by reifying the alternative (e.g. signage on the wall that says, “all projects,
personal and school-related, are welcome,” including it in orientation tours, or
demonstrating it in exhibits or Twitter feeds), they risk alienating some students who
may think their use or reason for being there does not fit with the ideal they have
been trumpeting.
In this chapter, we saw how students viewed the space as peripheral to the institution,
and the subsequent confusion about whether it was co- or extra-curricular or both.
Despite wanting to encourage both uses, I privileged co-curricular uses in how I
presented the space publicly and affected how some students used (or failed to use)
the space. This is another case of participation prevailing. Students saw Studio307
as peripheral to the institution, but not outside of it. They ended up seeing the space
as co-curricular or extra-curricular or both, I never clarified, and this resulted in
students being unsure how or if they could use the space.
In the next chapter, I explore the day-to-day interactions in Studio307 and how
students worked and learned together.

63

The Collegiality of it All
In previous chapters, I covered how students discovered the space (by invitation), a
reason for coming (technical anxiety), their needs once in the space (structure, but
also freedom), and how they viewed the space (as both co- and extra-curricular). In
this chapter, I want to explore what happened inside i.e. how we lived together. This
chapter is about the day-to-day relationships in Studio307. In previous work, I
defined collegiality as a term to describe the goodwill relationship between people
who are united in a purpose, respectful of one another’s work, and eager to help each
other. In that work, I argued that collegiality feeds discovery (Whyte, 2016). Here, I
want to focus less on collegiality’s role and more on a rich description of the
collegiality itself.
Parallel play (Parten, 1932), rather than organized collaboration, was common in
Studio307 amongst regular members. In these field notes excerpts, I describe two
quiet afternoons:
Field Notes (Oct, 2016): Mel popped in around 3:30, she
brought a friend, someone I’ve never met before. He worked
away on his SSHRC application, while she worked on a quilt
block she started yesterday. We mostly just worked quietly. I
fiddle with something, Mel sews, her friend types, the radio
plays. It was comfortable.
Field Notes (Nov, 2016): I actually don’t know what Jake was
working on, an analytics project maybe? I kept busy with the
whiteboard while he plugged away. The radio was playing, Che
popped by for a little chat, but otherwise we were just there,
working in tandem, doing our thing.

64

In these examples, we see a regular event in Studio307 – people working alongside,
but not with one another. Parallel play, a concept from education and early child
development originated by Mildred Parten Newhall, is when children play adjacent
to one another, but not with each other. They are interested in each other’s activities
and interact occasionally, but they mostly play alone (Parten, 1932). In the early
child development field, parallel play is described as a developmental milestone,
something someone passes on their way to organized, collaborative, or co-operative
play.
Organized co-operation or collaboration was surprisingly rare in Studio307. By this,
I mean actual collaboration on a shared project. I would see it if students were
working on a course-mandated group project (e.g. for the Critical Making course),
but spontaneous or naturally-developing collaboration was not frequent. In the
above, first field note excerpt, Mel was working on a quilt block that quiet afternoon.
She ended up posting the block on the white board with the words “Add to me” and
an arrow pointing to it. No one did. I started something, but never finished. Swapnil
similarly intended his custom Settlers of Catan game pieces to be a shared project,
but it never really took either. I do not know if we were on our way to collaborative
projects, perhaps I did not stay in the field long enough to find out. But, here, in
Studio307, and for the time I was there, the parallel state was often where we found
ourselves. I do not mean we never co-operated or shared knowledge, just that it was
rarely organized or focused on a shared project. The goal might be shared, but not
the product. This concept of parallel play might not, at first, sound very collegial,
everyone just chipping away at their own projects. But those moments of interest
and interaction did occur, just on independent projects rather than shared ones.
Collegial moments were most common during structured events or workshops, and
would often take the form of what I am calling chain-style learning where skills were

65

passed down the line from one student to the next. When we found ourselves
working on similar projects or towards similar goals, the staff and participants had
space and time to interact meaningfully. For example, I remember an overbooked
Intro to the Sewing Machines workshop. We had one sewing machine and six
people, four of whom had no experience. We also only had two hours. Within half
an hour, Sonya and Mel (two students participants) were helping others learn how
to use the machines while I helped someone prepare their next step. Within an hour,
previously inexperienced students were helping others learn the steps they had just
learned. It was a skills chain of necessity. People were united in a purpose (e.g. “let’s
learn how to use this thing”) and eager to help each other by passing on what they
had just learned.

Fig. 8. A typical week at Arduino Club
Arduino Club, a weekly drop-in session on physical computing targeted towards
students with a range of experience levels, was also often a site for this chain-style
learning. Arduino Club was project-based - meaning each week we each tackled a
small project using an Arduino microcontroller. We, the participating students and

66

I, would typically choose a project together from either the Arduino Projects Book
or the internet, and everyone would get an Arduino “kit” (a small box with an
assortment of common components and bits needed to complete simple projects) and
either a photocopy or link to instructions (Fig. 8), but the work itself was
independent. On weeks with a mix of experienced and inexperienced participants at
Arduino Club, things were less likely to follow the observed chain-like learning
structure as discussed above. Instead of passing each step down the line, there were
multiple mentors. Someone would present an open question to the group (e.g. “does
it matter which connector is which on this motor?”) and whomever had a moment
would answer. In weeks where almost everyone was a newcomer, things were
different and we would fall back into the chain-style learning pattern. I would start
by explaining basic concepts, maybe provide an overview of the project, but then
leave students to tackle it on their own. Heads would drop, students would plug
away, and within a few minutes, I would often find myself helping the first person
to reach the first hurdle or challenge. Then the next person to hit that hurdle or a
similar one would often be helped by the first. Like the Sewing Machine workshops,
this was also usually a product of necessity. I might be busy working on my own
project, helping someone else, or digging out a needed supply, but other students
who had just learned that skill or overcome that problem would step in. I would not
describe this as co-operative learning, which implies group work (e.g. everyone
working on a shared project). It was still parallel or adjacent, but with a chain-like
series of collegial interactions.
The literature on makerspaces often describes this chain-style learning as
collaboration or collaborative learning. In their work on the philosophy behind
educational makerspaces, Steven Kurti, Debby Kurti, and Laura Fleming (2014, p.
8), describe a familiar scenario they label as collaborative:

67

“For instance, consider a student experiencing a roadblock in
designing a gear reducer. As the first student struggles in the
design, another shares a solution he or she has used or is currently
using. Then together the students work to overcome the obstacle;
in this case one student is the classical "learner," while the other
is the classical "teacher." Yet as the students collaborate to meet
the challenge, they are both actively engaged in learning and
teaching new concepts to each other. All the while the adult
teacher observes from the outside, remaining out of the picture
unless further rigor becomes necessary. The primary objective of
the teacher in this case is to facilitate the acquisition of concepts
by building a specific project. This is the ideal learning
environment of an educational makerspace.”
I agree with Kurti, Kurti, and Fleming that this is a good, and at times ideal, learning
environment and that students teaching new concepts to each other is a common
scenario, like what we saw at the Sewing Workshop or Arduino Club. But I disagree
that this is collaboration. It is collegiality. It is knowledge sharing. It is chain-style
learning. It is not, by definition, collaboration. Students are working alongside one
another, towards a similar goal, and are eager to help one another, but the work is
still independent. Each student has their own kit, their own variation on the project
(there is almost always a personal tweak), their own motivations, and their own
goals. They are respectful of one another’s work but still personally invested in their
own creation and learning.
David Gauntlett’s approach to describing this social, yet still individual process, is
applicable here. In his book, Making is Connecting (2011), he argues that making is
connecting because acts of creativity usually involve, at some point, social
interactions and by making and sharing, people are engaging with and connecting to
their social and physical worlds. The benefits of this are, according to Gauntlett,
increased social capital, personal development or enrichment, and happiness.

68

Despite stressing the importance of relationships and social connections in this
process, Gauntlett then develops a definition of creativity that is still individual with
joy as its only required outcome. Collaboration is not a requirement (p. 76). What I
like about it is he still allows room for individual natures, motivations, and outcomes.
There is community, participation, and sharing, but there is still individual work or
purpose. Collaboration or co-operation often occur and there are subsequent
benefits, but they are not the ideal or end goal.
There is a tendency to vaunt collaboration as an ideal and seek it out as an indicator
of success, perhaps because interdisciplinary projects are lauded and funded. But,
when I look back at my time in Studio307, that is not how students worked. At the
start of this chapter, I asked what collegiality looked like in Studio307. Here, we saw
that while students were eager to help and work with one another, most projects were
still independent. Individuals had individual motivations and goals. Knowledge was
still shared and students still supported and respected one another, but organized
collaboration was rare and that is okay.
In the next and final chapter, I offer my conclusions in the form of recommendations
based on these findings.

69

Conclusions and Recommendations
In this conclusion, I will walk back through my findings not just to reiterate them,
but also to respond to them. The objective of this work was to understand why
students came to Studio307, their experiences once in the space, and, finally, ask
how these understandings can inform the ongoing development of Studio307 and
other spaces like it. This chapter is intended to address that last objective. However,
because no two makerspaces are alike (Moorefield-Lang, 2015) and my aim was to
describe Studio307’s community and my understanding of students’ experiences in
that particular social situation, my subsequent recommendations may not be
applicable in all cases. If you, the reader, are a practitioner designing or
administering a space like this or a student participating in one, and do not see your
own experiences reflected here, I encourage you to respond and to add your stories
to this work and others like it in the field.
For structure, this chapter is divided into five sections based on the five major themes
in this work – By Invitation Only (Chapter 5), Technical Anxiety (Chapter 6),
Needing Context to Imagine (Chapter 7), Peripheral to the Institution (Chapter 8),
and the Collegiality of it All (Chapter 9). Each section includes a summary of the
findings and, if applicable, the positive and negative consequences of those. This is
followed by succinct recommendations meant to embrace or address those findings.

10.1 By Invitation Only
In Chapter 5 – By Invitation Only, I explored the role personal relationships played
in not only encouraging students to visit Studio307, but also the depth of their
subsequent involvement. Despite a website, posters, or inclusion in the weekly

70

Faculty newsletter, it was often the personal invitation that first brought students into
Studio307. If students were not invited, their first introduction to the space was
typically a workshop or an event. Drop-ins were rare. I also found that the depth of
students’ involvement in the space was also dependent on personal relationships
because we failed to organize membership or make that process transparent. The
consequences of this were that we had unofficial tiers of members (for example,
those with keyfob access and those without, or those who felt comfortable using the
room as a personal workspace and those who only came for structured events) and
no clear path between the two.
Recommendations:
1. Personally invite students to the space. Almost everyone I spoke to first came
to Studio307 because they visited on an orientation tour, we spoke to their class,
or they were told about it by a friend or professor. Passive invitations like a
website, posters, or social media are, of course, crucial, but the personal
invitation is a powerful catalyst for involvement. Often, administrators wonder
how they can increase representation from various student groups, and the
question back should be – have you invited them? In short, invitations and
deliberate inclusions matter.
2. If membership is structured, make that structure known. The membership
structure of Studio307, where some students had keyfob access and others did
not, was not deliberate or widely understood. It developed on its own out of
necessity and was ad-hoc and unorganized. The consequence of this was a clublike atmosphere. If invitations and inclusions matter, so do memberships
structures. Make clear: the requirements for entry, how participants can get more
involved once in the space, and the paths for doing so.

71

10.2 Technical Anxiety
In Chapter 6 – Technical Anxiety, I discussed one reason or motivation for why
students visited Studio307. That is, an eager, but tense desire to increase their
technical capacity. I argued this was also related to why they enrolled in their
program and that the consequences felt in the space were both positive and negative.
Anxiety served as both a motivator and a barrier. For example, students cited
wanting to learn a particular technology as their reason for coming, while others
explained how anxiety or fear was why they never tried a particular tool. I also
concluded that technical anxiety may have served as a barrier for some students,
keeping them from Studio307 all together.
Recommendations:
3. Recognize technical anxiety as a motivator and provide a range of
programming. Technical anxiety drew students into the space. Our most
popular types of events fell into two categories, the first were 101 or Intro
sessions targeted at beginners and the second were very specific, targeted
workshops covering a particular technology and one or two applications. For
example, an ‘Intro to 3D Printing’ session or an ‘Accessing the Twitter API for
IoT Projects’ workshop. This range allowed for multiple entry points.
4. Recognize technical anxiety may also be a barrier and address it. This can
be done at both the tool and space levels. For example, providing introductory
workshops to various tools, documentation on how to use equipment, and
examples, or providing low-risk opportunities like our Halloween Costume Jam,
where students can use the space and equipment in a way that allows for a
diversity of interests. This can also be achieved through simple but explicit
signage that all skill levels are welcome, and purposeful staff efforts to make
that known at workshops and tours.

72

10.3 Needing Context to Imagine
In Chapter 7 – Needing Context to Imagine, I explored the role inspiration plays in
how students used the space and how they appreciated structured inspiration, but
also still wanted autonomy and freedom to explore. Often, tools that were not
included in examples went untouched and it was typically structured workshops that
served as the most powerful catalyst for use. However, autonomy was also valued
because it allowed for space to try new things and avoid embarrassment.
Recommendations:
5. Offer both open lab times and structured activities. In Burke’s work on
making makerspaces work in academic libraries (2015), he identifies providing
both “group training on specific creative activities” and “offering open lab
times” as way to encourage students and support different types of learning. He
also indicates this can sometimes be difficult in an academic setting where
learning is often sequestered in semesters and tied to curricula. At Studio307,
we tried to strike a balance by offering open hours and regular, structured events
(workshops, clubs, and talks) tied to curricula and personal interests.
6. Let students be alone in the space. Time alone allows for exploration and risktaking that often leads to ownership of the space and greater capacity. If security
is a concern, this can be done by an organized lock and key access outside of
regular hours. At Studio307, students working on projects were offered key-fob
access in an ad-hoc manner and, as we saw, this caused confusion, but at the
Invention Studio at Georgia Tech, students earn 24-hr access through an
organized volunteer hours system. However, the volunteer model requires
administration, oversight, and astutely navigating the unpaid labour landscape.

73

10.4 Peripheral to the Institution
In Chapter 8 – Peripheral to the Institution, I found students viewed the space as
peripheral to the institution and explored the subsequent confusion over whether it
was co- or extra-curricular, or both. In failing to formally define the space, we
suffered consequences such as confusion or hesitation around how or if the space,
or the equipment within it, could be used. Compounding this, we inadvertently
privileged the co-curricular.
Recommendations:
7. Define how the space can be used. This exercise of defining how the space can
be used is useful not just for participating students, but also administrators.
Vocalizing that definition can help avoid privileging one use over the other.
While I, and Studio307, did not excel in this area, some things that could be done
are simple signs saying “personal projects are welcome” (assuming this is true),
and including this information in orientation tours and documentation.
8. Adhere to that definition. If your space is open for both co- and extra-curricular
projects, demonstrate that in your programming, outreach, and how you exhibit
or celebrate student work in the space. For example, at Studio307, we offered
events like the Costume Jam (extra-curricular) alongside Python workshops (cocurricular). Or, when celebrating student work, we showcased personal interest
projects (e.g. posting Mel’s 3D-printed black cat phone stand on our Twitter
feed) alongside an exhibit of student projects from the Faculty’s Critical Making
class.

10.5 The Collegiality of it All
In Chapter 9 – The Collegiality of it All, I discussed how collegiality in Studio307
manifested as parallel play rather than the rarer organized collaboration. At its most

74

visible moments, collegiality took the form of chain-style learning where students
would pass skills down the line as they each encountered and overcome similar
challenges. This was especially true during workshops and club days where
participants had a range of experience levels and staff were often unavailable to
provide one-on-one support.
Recommendations:
9. Allow time for discussion and down-time. When planning a workshop, try to
weave in time for discussion and down-time. It is in these moments that
collegiality and discovery flourish. In previous work, I recommended
makerspace administrators and staff reduce structure in workshops, when
possible, and make room for playfulness and collegiality (Whyte, 2016). This
recommendation was based on the finding that while catalytic moments were
often born out of initially structured interactions, it was the downtime or
collegial moments that often led to deeper discovery. For example, at Studio307,
our most effective workshops were often those that provided time and space for
those moments.
10. Encourage collegiality by leading by example. When staff members or peer
supporters actively show interest in the work of others, ask for help themselves,
or allow participants to support or teach others (e.g. answer questions or help a
peer), it creates an atmosphere of collegiality. This behavior can often set off
chain-style learning by putting students at ease, and letting them know it’s okay
to ask for or provide support and show interest in the work of others.

10.6 Conclusion
When I worked in community radio, I was fascinated by why and how people
participated, what brought them to join, work, and stay. With this work, I wanted to
apply that question to libraries, specifically makerspaces in libraries, and the people

75

who bring those spaces to life. I felt that makerspaces provided a site similar to
community radio, one that included creativity, production, and participation.
However, in this work, I did not give universal answers for my research questions
and this highlights the point I learned from my research, an overarching theme, that
not only are makerspaces unique, but so are the people that enliven them. Their
motivations, perceptions, and outcomes are diverse and that diversity should be
fostered in how this space and others like it are operated. In other words, provide for
different learning needs (e.g. open hours and structured workshops), provide for
different expectations (e.g. co- and extra-curricular, or beginner and advanced), and
provide for different personalities (e.g. personal invitations and more documented
or formalized systems for inclusion). And while I declared I would not be explaining
maker culture or makerspaces as a whole, perhaps this is my universal statement –
these spaces are diverse, the people within them are diverse, the communities they
serve are diverse, and that uniqueness should be considered when both operating and
studying a makerspace. These are local spaces with local communities and while
others may learn from my work and the work of others, the uniqueness of each space
must always be considered.
As makerspaces shift further into the realm of library and museum services, I hope
that stories and descriptions (like the ones provided here) and my encouragement to
consider the uniqueness of each individual space and community, will prove
valuable for future work in this field.
