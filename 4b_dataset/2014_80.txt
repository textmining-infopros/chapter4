Abstract
This qualitative research emphasis is on libraries at major universities and how they operate as
separate and independent units within the university and yet function as part of the university
community. While libraries serve as essential, supportive resources for learning, they have their
own challenges, organizational features, objectives, opportunities, and functions.

Library

leadership is a distinct and integral part of the campus environment. Leadership styles help
determines the effectiveness of the libraries in accomplishing their objectives and their mission
statement. Leadership styles also determine in part how leaders transform values into actions,
and realities, and how these organizations address internal and external challenges and change.
Leadership style is an important factor in determining the performance, effectiveness, and
productivity of the organization and its staff. Leaders choose one or more styles to lead based in
part on the situation at the time. There is no single leadership style that may be considered as the
right one. Leadership styles are reflected in behaviors and attitudes. It is up to the individual to
determine which style is appropriate at the time.

Dedication
This research study was dedicated to my uncle Dr. Charles C. Alston, my dad Mr. Sandy
Alston, and the evening and weekend staff at the C.G. O’Kelly Library at Winston-Salem State
University. My dad and my uncle are now deceased but before my uncle’s passing, he
encouraged me to get my PhD in some area in leadership administration. The evening and
weekend library staff and several members of the daytime staff constantly encouraged me and
helped to keep me focused.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Introduction to the Problem
Leadership is found in all organizations and at different levels. Leadership is complex and
academics and practitioners have long been perplexed by its complexity (Schnurr, 2009).
Leadership is a concern of librarians because, as professionals, they have to operate in
environments which are very challenging in today’s economic times.
Though effective leadership endures, there are different approaches to understanding its
nature. Covey (2004) stated that “leadership has two sides, what a person is, character, and what
a person does, which is competence” (p.98). More specifically, Kippenberger (2002) noted that
the appropriate style of leadership depends on a wide variety of criteria, including the
relationship between the parties involved, the nature of what needs to be done, and the match or
mismatch between the difficulty of the task and the competencies of who is available. Howard
(2005) stated that leadership is a process of communication -- verbal and non-verbal -- that
involves coaching, motivating, inspiring, directing, guiding, supporting, and counseling others.
There are many ways to lead, and each leader has his or her own style that most often is
based on a combination of the person’s beliefs, values, and preferences as well as the
organizational culture and norms that could encourage some leadership styles and discourage
others. One thing to remember, according to Kippenberger (2002), is that good leaders tend to
utilize all styles depending on the situation and circumstances at the time.
Leadership is one of the most observed and least understood phenomena. Researchers have
found that effective leadership is difficult to determine and that there is no one best way to lead.

1

Kippenberger (2002) states that it is up to each individual to absorb from the wealth of ideas,
qualities, and characteristics available and choose the best one that fits his or her personality
as well as the needs of the organization.
In the last three decades, academic libraries have changed their services, organizational
constructs, technologies, values, ownership and access policies, staff, and the overall library
environment. “Academic libraries have faced reduced budgets at a time when their purchases are
increasing in cost” (Gwyer 2010, p.4). These changes have caused library leaders to be more
aggressive in fulfilling their academic support roles and to work more closely with the faculty,
develop more partnerships, and collaborate with other campus departments to accomplish library
objectives.
Library leaders are fully aware that the library’s essence is service, resources, and satisfied
customers and that the delivery of services is a critical measure that justifies the existence of
their organizational unit through the receipt of substantial resources from its parent organization,
the university. The academic library has from its inception been “an integral part of institutions
of higher learning, rather than an appendix adjunct” (Okon, 2005). The academic library, like
other establishments or public organizations, has been designed and run by people whose job is
to combine and use organizational resources to achieve organizational objectives.
Through all of the changes taking place in American higher education, the library profession
is concerned about the next generation of leaders as interest in the profession is waning. As
Hernon, Powell, and Young (2003) found, fewer librarians are actually entering the profession
than are needed to keep pace due to the predicted numbers of librarians that will be leaving the
field for retirement or for other reasons such as changes in employment.

2

Martin (2003) noted that librarianship was one of the professions with a greater than
average proportion of workers over 45 years of age. With the median age of 47, it was estimated
that 50,000 librarians were needed to replace those retiring between 1998 and 2008. According
to Martin (2003), among librarians with degrees, 17% have reached the age of 65 during the
years of 2005-2009, and another 21% in 2010-2014. Those that are in leadership positions were
no different. Ninety-one percent of library leaders from academic libraries were 50 and older.
Franks (2012) also found that the workforce within the field of librarianship is aging and will
soon be replaced by a younger cohort of information professionals.
The success of libraries, as with all organizations, is determined by the actions of the
individuals who work in them. The success of the individuals in carrying out the missions of
their libraries is a reflection of the type, quality, and style of leadership. As Stephens and Cole
(2009) noted, successful library leaders demonstrated certain skills that are instrumental in the
delivery of desired outcomes. They stated further that there were four key attributes library
leaders should possess: cognitive ability, vision, interpersonal effectiveness, and managerial
effectiveness. Cognitive ability focused on problem solving which is the ability to solve
problems actively and creatively, and fosters an environment that encourages and allows persons
to create solutions for problems. Decision making is creating choices and assuming
responsibility for the decisions that have been made. Vision is the ability to look beyond the
institution or the library and its current issues to consider the impact on the community. It also
means embracing new technologies. Interpersonal effectiveness focuses on diverse cultures,
accountability, team building, development, inspirational, motivational skills and communication
skills.
3

Stephens and Cole (2009) found that managerial effectiveness focuses on managing change,
resource management, strategic planning, collaboration, flexibility, and adaptability of new
ideas. Andolsen (2008) indicated that there were also other competencies or important
characteristics that were applicable to leadership that included integrity, the ability to delegate,
motivate and encourage, foster team spirit, train, set standards and establish discipline.
Throughout the last 30 years, researchers have found that library leaders’ administrative
functions and their priorities have not changed markedly. Leaders are still concerned with library
budgets, supervising and motivating staff performance, participating in discussions about library
policies, determining user needs and demands, communicating the library’s purpose to the
public, participating in professional library activities, and obtaining financial resources. In
addition, these functions are significantly and continuously impacted by new technologies.
Stephens and Cole (2009) found also that managerial effectiveness focuses on managing change,
resource management, strategic planning, collaboration, flexibility, and adaptability of new
ideas. Andolsen (2008) found that there were other competencies or important characteristics
that were applicable to leadership that included integrity, the ability to delegate, motivate and
encourage, foster team spirit, train, set standards and establish discipline. These were all
important factors to library leadership.
Libraries are at the intersection of many challenges in higher education: research, computer
and communications technology, and scholarly communication. Therefore, according to Martin
(2003), library leaders must be able to communicate effectively with a wide range of
constituencies and collaborate as partners with those in information management.

4

Library

leaders’ ability to advance the goals of their institutions and respond to the informational needs is
critical, as is envisioning the future of their organization.
The challenge before the library leader is how to lead most effectively in a rapidly changing
environment that is characterized by budget and staff reductions, their university’s strategic
plans, changes in administration, and issues inherited from former administrations. Nine
university libraries are leading in their environments and the leadership styles they have adopted
and have used, are the focus of this study.

Background of the Study
As noted by Hernon and Powell (2003), the importance of leadership and its impact on
libraries have not been adequately examined by scholars. The library and information science
professions have not focused on the actual leadership styles of library leaders or administrators,
although there have been studies on the characteristics, competencies, and qualities that were
desirable for library leaders or administrators.
There is clear recognition that the times are calling for a greater focus on library leadership.
According to Miriam, Elizabeth, and Morgan (2013), if libraries are to survive and flourish, they
must have inspired leadership that will transform and energize them and inspire their staff.
Library leaders must step up to the challenge of leading during a period of continuous change.
Miriam, Elizabeth, and Morgan (2013) further indicated that the best leaders provided vision,
stimulated innovation, upheld integrity, and fostered student and colleague morale.
In the past, there was not a great need for visionary leadership because libraries were known
for traditional services that included reference, bibliographic instruction, reserves, interlibrary
5

loan, and circulation of books and some audiovisual materials and equipment. Now the role of
libraries has changed, as well as the perceived value of the library (Schonfield, 2010).
Students once relied heavily on librarians for research assistance and finding materials and
resources. The faculty relied on libraries for scholarly materials for research and teaching, and
librarians guided them to those resources. Currently, both the students and the faculty are using
more online resources than previously, so the shift from the traditional practices to more selfdirected ones is firmly in place. Library leaders must now accommodate those changes while at
the same time reserve the library as the focal point and source of information for the campus.
Library leaders today have to focus on their libraries as being the gateway for locating
information and resources, as a repository for those resources, and as a teaching center
(Schonfield, 2010). Therefore, it was important to determine what leadership styles and
strategies library leaders were using to adjust successfully to the changing role of their libraries.
Statement of the Problem
According to Glee (2007), the impact of leadership styles within libraries has not been well
studied. The challenge faced by academic libraries today requires new leadership techniques.
Today, libraries are driven by evolving technology along with pressing economic issues,
personnel issues, political pressures, and social realities. The real challenge for library leaders is
to define their special goals and visions, acquire as many management and leadership skills as
possible, and finally to know when to use them to influence others to reach the necessary
outcomes (Leading through a Crisis, 2009).
Leadership styles are crucial to the success of libraries and organizations. The success of
libraries -- or any organization -- is determined by the actions of the individuals that work in
6

libraries, and those individuals who carry out the libraries’ missions. The measure of the success
is reflective of the type and quality of leadership (Stephens and Cole, 2009).
Hersberger, Stephens and Russell (2004), noted that situations influence leadership styles and
that leaders are going to use different aspects of leadership traits at least some of the time. It is
this situation that makes it difficult to determine whether there was one leadership style that is
most appropriate and effective for today’s library leader. Leadership focuses on influencing
others to attain organizational or group goals. This is why leaders must have a number of
competencies, skills, and abilities, so as to be able to apply the appropriate leadership style to the
situation at hand. Libraries need more than leaders and leadership styles (Germano, 2010).
Library leaders are called upon to make the case for the importance of the library to the
administration, the faculty, and departments. They have to explore and understand leadership
styles to help to ensure that libraries not only survive, but prosper. As was noted by Nichols
(2004), leadership styles of library leaders and the strategies they use, impact library services, the
staff, and the overall library program. This impact could be positive or negative. The positive
impact produces staff support, a substantial budget that facilitates growth of the collection and
resources, expansion of library services, continuous collaboration among the faculty, support
from university administrators, and customer satisfaction from faculty, students, and staff.
Negative impact results in little or no support from staff, dissatisfaction among faculty and
staff, little or no growth in the collection and resources, no budget increase, and shortages for
needed staff, equipment, and materials. The negative impact results in less financial support
which, of course, affects the entire library program.

7

Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study was to compare the different leadership styles and examine how
those styles could impact the library’s environment, the staff, and overall library program. Some
leadership styles may have had a greater effect or impact than others. The key to successful
leadership, according to Howard (2005), is to have a wide range of skills that would allow
persons to use the appropriate leadership style according to the situation at hand.
Kippenberger (2002) found that the values that individual library leaders possess could
impact their leadership style. An effective leadership style usually reflects the leaders’ character
type, characteristics of their followers, and the situation. Leaders adapt their style, but they
should not “distort their personality because that could create a false self” (p.8).
Stephens and Cole (2009) stated that leadership styles of library leaders are important and the
impact of those styles could affect the way in which they lead. There are other personal attributes
like honesty and ethics that contribute to the effectiveness of library leaders. Some library
leaders that do not possess certain competencies may be unable to initiate, facilitate, and deliver
successful services.

Rationale for the Study
There was an identified need to better understand the impact of leadership styles in libraries,
especially in light of the many challenges faced by academic leaders in this period of economic
decline. Research has been conducted on library leaders and leadership within libraries but the
focus has been on suggested skills, traits, and competencies that library leaders or administrators
should possess and less on the styles and strategies that library leaders have to employ in the face
8

of changing and challenging circumstances. The purpose of this study was to compare the
different leadership styles and examine how those styles could impact the library’s environment,
the staff, and the overall library program. Riggs (1997) found the responsibility to set the right
direction is more complicated now, so the right choices have to be made in terms of leadership
and leadership styles. No matter what the challenges were -- economic, political, social -- the
challenge for library leaders is to define the specific goals or vision, acquire as many leadership
skills and management skills as possible, and to know when to use them to influence their
followers and others to reach their designated objectives.

Research Questions
The research questions were guides for this study. A review of the literature and a
comparative overview of the different leadership styles were the basis for the inquiry. Library
leaders used different leadership styles and often a combination of styles that were based on the
focus of the library program, university strategic plan, and the current situation. Leadership
styles must be adaptable and responsive in a dynamic manner to the changes in the vision and
role of the library. Library leaders must use tradition and precedent, but at the same time, remain
vigilant regarding current and future trends in their field and the communities they serve. The
specific research questions addressed were:
Research Question: How did academic library leaders respond to the challenges posed by
dramatically changing circumstances and conditions within American higher education?
Subquestion 1: How have library leaders had to adjust their leadership style and
strategies to meet new challenges?
9

Subquestion 2: What leadership styles and strategies have been most effective
in meeting these changing circumstances?
Subquestion 3: What leadership styles and strategies have proven to be
in-effective?
Significance of the Study
Nichols (2004) stated “librarians were concerned about the state of leadership in the
profession” (p.38). Library leaders were concerned with leadership because it was such an
integral part of management. Shoaf (2004) maintained that leaders are faced with technological
changes, reduced and falling budgets, an aging workforce, outdated organizational charts, and
competition for constituencies. Thus, leadership has become more important in libraries than
ever before. There is a greater awareness by leaders regarding the leadership needs and they
have been emphasized in the literature for nearly a decade. The role of library leaders, noted
Shoaf (2004), has changed drastically over the past 10 years and this was evident for persons that
have been in the profession for extended periods of time. The library has been restructured and
work groups and teams are performing more of the work. Email has replaced the printed memo
and new leaders are using it. Fundraising has become one of the major tasks of library
management due to decreasing budgets. Some core library activities remain but technology has
taken over and has supplemented special skills that leading libraries once required.
The rapid speed of change in information services demanded that libraries adjust to meet the
expectations of the library patron. Staff issues, recruitment, training, management policies, as
well as the digital divide were all areas demanding creative leadership (Schreiber and Shannon,
2001).
10

Stephens and Cole (2009) stated that successful leadership in libraries was demonstrated by
the delivery of desired outcomes that required important skills and competencies. Riggs (2008)
noted that library leaders must create an environment that embraces change not as a threat, but as
an opportunity. Library leaders have to find ways to encourage their staff and followers to
engage in calculated risk taking. Different styles are needed for different situations and each
leader needed to know when to implement a different approach. Riggs (2008) further contended
that library leaders must know based on organizational goals and its values what is best for the
library, the library program, the staff, and themselves.
The focus of this study was to look at the actual leadership styles of a select number of library
leaders who are coping successfully with the myriad challenges and issues that have been
identified thus far. By so doing, the researcher would be able to identify best practices and
insights that could be shared with the leaders of academic libraries throughout the United States.

Definition of Terms
The terms used in this dissertation were defined to provide a better understanding of the
study. Listed are many of the terms used when discussing leadership and leadership styles.
Leadership is a complex mix of responsibilities and accountabilities (Otazo, 2007).
Affiliative leadership – leaders presume people came with an attitude (Leading People,
2006, p.21).
Authoritative leadership – leaders establish overall goals and push people to
follow (Leading People, 2006, p.21).

11

Autocratic leadership -- applies to situations wherein there is little time for group
decision-making or where the leader is the most knowledgeable member of the group (Mind
Tools, org, p.2)
Bureaucratic leadership -- the leader goes by the book and everything has to be done
according to policy (Mind Tools, org. p. 2)
Charismatic leadership -- the leader is an agent of change; someone who dispenses with
what was previously accepted as given and challenges the existing understanding of values
(Charteris- Black, 2007).
Coaching leadership – leaders focus on personal development (Leading People, 2006,
p.21).
Coercive leadership – leaders give orders and expects them to be obeyed (p.21).
Command and control -- an unsophisticated management style in which subordinates are
told what to do, and have little say in what, why, and when (Nwlink.com. p.1)
Delegative leadership -- offers little or no guidance to group members and leaves
decision-making up to the group members (Germano, p. 1)
Democrative leadership – leaders give employees a role in decision making (Leading
People, 2006, p.21).
Democratic leadership -- often called the participative style and this style encourages
employees to be a part of decision-making (Germano, p.1)
Laissez-faire leadership -- the leader provides little of no direction and this style allows
the employees to do everything themselves. It is also described as the “hands off” style (Lewin,
p.1)
12

Leadership -- a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to
achieve a common goal (Northouse, 2007).
Leadership style -- the manner and approach to leadership and management based on
different assumptions and theories (Leading People, 2006, p.21).
Pacesetting leadership – leaders set high performance standards (Leading People, 2006,
p.21).
Pragmatic leadership -- leaders focus on the organization rather than the people and face
the realities of the business environment (Leading through a crisis, 2009).
Strategic leadership -- embodies the main idea, and those leaders have to be personally
credible and have to demonstrate an understanding of the organization context (James & Collins,
2008).
Transactional leadership -- occurs when one person takes the initiative in making contact
with others for the purpose of an exchange of values or things (Charteris-Black, 2007).
Transformational leadership -- deals with the leader’s effect on the followers’ values,
self-esteem, trust and confidence in the leader; and their motivation to perform above and
beyond the call of duty (Charteris-Black, 2007).
Leaders have responsibility for building organizations where people continually expand their
capabilities to understand complexity, clarify vision and improve shared mental models
(O’Brien, 2005). They also communicate the goals of the organization to the group.
Leadership code provides both structure and guidance and helps one to know not only what to
do to be a better individual leader, but also how to build better leadership capability.

13

Leadership skills are the abilities to use one’s knowledge and competencies to accomplish a set
of goals or objectives that could be acquired or learned (Northouse, 2007).

Assumptions and Limitations
The proposed study had certain assumptions as well as limitations. The assumptions were:
1. The library administrators would be honest in answering all questions that would be asked.
2. Leadership styles of library administrators had an impact on libraries.
3. There was no single style of leadership that always worked.
4. Library leaders carried out their roles using a variety of leadership styles that impacted
their libraries.
5. Library leaders’ leadership styles adjusted according to the situation that faced them.
The limitations of this study were:
1. The small number of participants would limit the ability to generalize the findings.
Ten library leaders were asked to participate in this study and each would represent
a different library profile: a small student body (2,000 or less); medium
student body (6,500 and up); and a larger student body (15,000 and up) with a substantial
library budget ($1million and up, a medium to large staff of 20-100); an administration
supportive of the library, and a university community of library users and supporters.
2. The findings of this study could be limited and less applicable to other academic libraries
that are smaller in size and has less staff, students, and faculty. The findings would also be
less applicable to libraries that have smaller budgets, less support from the administration,

14

those that are struggling just to maintain their existence, and those that are trying to sustain
their present service level. The library leaders selected for this study were librarians with
a minimum of 10 to 15 years of administrative experience and would not have had a major
reduction in their budgets. Library leaders used in this study could have limited applicability
to other academic libraries in other areas and also to the broader world of academic
librarianship.
Nature of the Study
This study is a qualitative research study. Qualitative research uses “text as empirical material
instead of numbers” (Flick, 2007, p.2). Qualitative research uses participants in settings through
interviews, conversations, photographs, and notes. The research involved an interpretive
approach.
The research design planned was a case study. The research methods used included: a
narrative analysis of information in the field, interviews, conversations, and other relevant
materials. This study compared and contrasted leadership styles and reviewed the available
literature to determine the outcomes based on characteristics of each style. The research
questions were the basis for the study.
The criteria used for this study are based on library leaders’ competencies and their impact on
their libraries. Library leaders’ success is based on their abilities to articulate their programs and
services to their publics and to synthesize their programs and services for students, faculty, and
staff (Hersberger, 1989).

15

Organization of the Remainder of the Study
Chapter 2 is a review of the literature pertaining to the different leadership styles and includes
a comparison and contrast of the various styles. Chapter 3 is a description and discussion of the
research methodology used in this study. Chapter 4 is the data collection analysis, and Chapter 5
focuses on the conclusions that were drawn from this study as well as recommendations.

16

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW
The literature review examines the different leadership styles, traits, and characteristics of
each style. Each leadership style is identified along with the common characteristics of each
style. The style that a leader adopts when dealing with those that follow them becomes their
style or their way of behaving. Different situations may require different leadership styles.
The purpose of this study is to compare the different leadership styles and examine how those
styles could impact the library’s environment, the staff, and overall library program. It was
necessary and important to review and examine the scholarly literature on the different styles.
Leadership styles must match the settings for the leaders to be effective as was stated by
Northouse (2010). The challenge for leaders is to “use a leadership style that best meets their
followers’ motivational needs as well as choosing a behavior that complements or supplements
what may be missing in the work settings” (p.125).
In Harvard Business School’s publication, Leading People (2006), the authors stated that
effective leaders were not born with knowing how to lead, that effective leaders gained
experience and knowledge, and they saw and listened to the world both inside the organization
and outside. Effective leaders assumed leadership qualities needed for different situations, “they
adapted leadership style to the needs of the people, gave latitude to those who could handle
delegation, provided coaching skills and confidence, and finally gave directions to those who
needed close supervision” (p.22).
Leadership was consistently performed to bring about positive changes in people,
organizations, and businesses that provided services and products. Cooper (2002) claimed that
“leadership meant doing the right things for the right reasons” (p. 24). He went on to state that
17

leadership was not a perfect skill and should not be confused with perfection. Leadership
required an individual to perform consistently over a period of time, and this consistency enabled
the individual to be seen as reliable and dependable.
Germano (2010) stated that leadership had a direct cause and effect relationship on the
organization’s success. The organization’s leaders determined values, the culture, change, and
employee motivation. He found that “library leaders directly affected everything from the patron
experience to successfully executing stated missions, including allocations, services offered, and
collection development strategies” (p. 1).
The influence of leadership style on job performance, satisfaction, stress, and turnover
retention had been well established according to Chen and Silverthorne (2005). “Leadership style
had an impact on organizations, departments and teams as well as work climate and atmosphere,
and leaders that wanted the best results should not rely on one single leadership style” (p.280).
Leadership is a complex and dynamic process that has been defined and described in
different ways according to Lentz (2009). She stated that leadership could be described as
autocratic in which the leaders take an authoritarian approach; it is often characterized by one
individual being in control. Democratic leadership is characterized by a participative leadership
style. Situational leaders advocate that one style of leadership does not fit all, while
transformational leaders have a very clear vision of what is best for the group as a whole. The
free-rein leader has no clear structure or leadership style.
Current leadership theories have described leaders based upon traits or how influence and
power were used to achieve goals and objectives. When using trait-based descriptions, leaders
could be classified as autocratic, democratic, bureaucratic, or charismatic. In viewing leadership
18

from the perspective of securing outcomes, and exchange of power, leaders were situational,
transactional, or transformational. As Germano (2010) contended, “not all leaders were created
equal, and leadership quality could vary within an organization, but identifying a leader’s style
was central to evaluating leadership quality and effectiveness as it related to the goals of the
organization” (p.13).
Leadership Styles
According to Northouse (2007), leadership style consisted of the behavior pattern of the
person who attempted to influence others.

Included were the directed task behaviors and

supportive relationship behaviors. He further discussed directive behaviors that assisted persons
by giving direction, setting time lines or deadlines, establishing goals and methods of evaluations
and showing how the goals were to be achieved (Northouse, 2007). He further stated that
directive behaviors clarified through communication what was to be done, how to do it, and who
was responsible for doing it. Supportive behaviors helped persons feel comfortable about
themselves, their co-workers, and the situation. They also involved two-way communication and
responses that showed support (Northouse, 2007).
While there are characteristics that all leadership styles share, they can be delineated into 10
major styles as revealed in the reviewed literature. These leadership styles include: autocratic,
bureaucratic, democratic, laissez-faire, charismatic, transformational, transactional, strategic,
delegative, and authoritarian. The following is an examination of each of those leadership styles.

19

Autocratic Leadership
Autocratic leaders are “do as I say” types. Germano (2010) stated that autocratic leaders were
inexperienced when leadership was thrust upon them in the form of a new position or assignment
that involved people management. Autocratic leaders “could damage an organization as they
force their followers to execute strategies and services in a very narrow way upon a subjective
idea of what success looked like” (Germano, 2010, p.3).
Autocratic leadership has no shared vision and very little motivation beyond coercion.
Commitment, creativity, and innovation are eliminated under autocratic leadership. This form of
leadership is sometimes described as “waiting for the inevitable failure and the removal or
demise of the leader” (Germano, 2010). He noted that autocratic leadership is sometimes
referred to as authoritarian because it provides clear expectations of what needs to be done.
There is a clear division between the leader and the follower. The autocratic style does not allow
employees to give any input, and they are expected to obey orders and directions without any
explanations.
Germano (2010) stated that the autocratic leadership style has been greatly criticized during
the past 30 years, although it remained popular with many CEO’s. Johannsen and Pors (2012)
further contended that this dictatorial style fostered higher rates of turnover and more
absenteeism. Gen X employees -- those born between 1965 and 1980 -- were more resistant to
this management style. This style has been most effective when employees do not respond to
other leadership behaviors, the areas are poorly managed, employees challenge the leader’s
power, there is limited time to make decisions, and there are daily high production needs.

20

Bureaucratic Leadership
Germano (2010) found that bureaucratic leaders placed a heavy reliance on policy in meeting
the goals of their organization and are most comfortable articulating policy to convince their
followers to get on board. The author stated further that bureaucratic leaders are usually
committed to procedures and processes rather than people, and as a result they appeared to be
aloof and highly adverse to change. A negative trait about bureaucratic leaders in Germano’s
view is that, “leadership’s greatest benefit was motivating and developing people, was ignored
by bureaucratic leaders” (p.1). He also claimed that bureaucratic leaders went by the book.
Everything had to be done according to policy and if it was not documented, the issues were
referred to the next level above. Germano (2010) summarized this style of leadership as “more of
a police officer than a leader.” Lewin (1939) an early scholar on leadership, stated that
bureaucratic leadership was most effective when routine tasks were performed repetitively. It
was also stated that employees that worked in a bureaucratic environment needed to understand
certain standards and procedures Bureaucratic leadership was usually ineffective when
employees lost interest in their jobs and their coworkers, and they did only what was expected of
them and no more (Lewin, 1939).
Democratic Leadership
Maughan (2009) stated that democratic leadership centers on the contributions of the
employees. Democratic leaders feel that the more employees contributed to the work
environment, the more ownership they would feel which would increase their productivity and
satisfaction. Germano (2010) claimed that with democratic leadership there is no one defined
leader. He also noted that democratic leaders are usually frustrated by the efforts required to
21

build a consensus for even the most mundane decision and this could lead to poor decision
making and weak execution. The largest problem with democratic leadership, in Germano’s
opinion, was that everyone seemed to have a stake in an outcome as well as the shared level of
expertise in regards to the decisions made. Daft (2008) found that democratic leaders delegated
authority to others, encouraged participation, relied on subordinates’ knowledge for completing
tasks and depended on their respect for influence. Germano (2010) summarized the positives of
democratic leadership: it encourages the staff to self-evaluate job performance; it encourages
employees to grow professionally by offering more opportunities to be promoted; and, it
recognizes and encourages achievement. This leadership style is not appropriate when
implementing changes or resolving individual or group problems. But Germano argued it is most
effective when there is a need to encourage team building and participation and when one
wanted to keep staff informed about matters that affected them. Finally, Maughan (2009) found,
democratic leadership should not be used when there is not enough time to get everyone’s input,
when the leader feels threatened by this type of leadership, or when it is easier and more cost
effective for the leader to make decisions.
Laissez-Faire Leadership
Eeden and Cilliers (2003) stated that laissez-faire leadership implied avoidance or absence of
leadership and they referred to it as passive leadership. Laissez-faire is French for ‘leave it be’
and is used to describe leaders who allow colleagues to do their work with little supervision. It
can be effective if the leader monitors what is being achieved and consistently communicates
with the team. This form of leadership often works best for teams in which the individuals or
followers are very experienced and are skilled self-starters (Mind Tools, 2010).
22

Laissez-faire leadership, according to James and Collins (2008), is best described as the
hands-off style. With this style of leadership, all power and authority are given to the staff and
they make decisions. The authors also stated that the leader provides little or no direction and
gives staff an inordinate amount of freedom. In this leadership style, the leader avoids taking a
stand, ignores problems, does not follow up, and usually refrains from intervening. Laissez-faire
leadership seems to be most effective when there is a trustworthy and experienced staff, they are
highly skilled and educated, and when the staff has the drive and experience to perform
successfully on their own. This style of leadership is ineffective when the staff is insecure, a
manager or leader is needed most of the time, the leader does not understand this or the
responsibilities, and the staff requires feedback on their performance. The laissez-faire leadership
style is sometimes referred to as the delegative style.
Kurt Lewin (1939) found that people working under laissez-faire leadership most often made
even more demands on their leaders. Not surprisingly, Jones and Rudd (2008) termed this
category of leadership “non-leadership style” because leaders avoided accepting responsibilities
and are absent when needed. They fail to follow up on requests for assistance, they resist
expressing their views on important issues, and they do not provide direction or guidance.
Charismatic Leadership
Shriberg, and Shriberg (2003) claimed that the charismatic leadership style involves a
relationship between the leader and the people being led in which the leader is believed to
possess inspirational and charismatic qualities. These leaders are fueled by society’s belief that
they have special powers and abilities and therefore they are given power based on personal

23

authority rather than by traditions or laws. The leaders possess skills, intellect, and courage that
inspire others to follow them, and they seek change.
Charteris-Black (2007) found that charismatic leaders induced a high degree of loyalty,
commitment, and devotion from their followers. These leaders thrive when most of the attention
is given to the apparent rather than the real. As long as the image of success is pursued, then
effectiveness is pursued. In the Woodruffe study (2004), he found that the charismatic leadership
style could appear similar to transformational leadership in that the leader injects huge doses of
enthusiasm into the team and the leader is very energetic in getting others to follow. This style
also requires the traits of self-confidence and conviction. Charismatic leaders, argued Woodruffe
(2004), usually have goals that are not easily specified, measured, and could possible involve
quite a bit of stress and uncertainty as well as a large degree of moral involvement. Daft (2008)
reported that charismatic leaders have an emotional impact on people because they appeal to the
heart and the mind, they speak emotionally about putting themselves on the line for the sake of a
mission, and they emerge in troubled times. He further stated that charismatic leaders believe in
empowerment which assures their followers of their competency and opportunities to experience
success. Lastly, their leadership is based on personal qualities rather than the power and authority
granted by organizations and that instills awe and submission.
Transformational Leadership
Woodruffe (2004) found that transformational leadership is linked to charisma.
Transformational leaders articulate a shared realistic vision, they create a sense of purpose, their
individualized concern is inspired by acting as a model, they stimulate their followers
intellectually, and they give. According to Rowold and Rohmann (2010), leaders that have
24

adopted a transformational style of leadership “emphasized higher motive development and
arouse followers’ motivation and positive emotions by means of creating and representing an
inspiring vision for the future” (p. 271 ). For these authors, transformational leadership appeared
to offer more practical possibilities and opportunities than charismatic leadership as it tended to
suggest to leaders behavioral attitudes that could extract the best from their followers.
Liontos and Balster (1993) found three goals of transformational leadership:


Helping staff develop and maintain a collaborative and professional culture, involving
their staff, and using bureaucratic mechanisms to support cultural changes



Actively communicating the organization’s norms and beliefs



Helping solve problems effectively

Adair (2009) found that transformational leaders are change agents and enablers because they
inspired those who are working for them to become high performers and enabled their followers
to become leaders themselves. Transformational leaders become moral agents because they spur
personal and professional growth in the followers. Taffinder (2006) described the general
characteristics of transformational

leaders as follows: transformational leaders have deep

convictions about what they want to achieve, they are prepared to go against conventional
wisdom, they have determination to make things happen to execute plans, they seek
opportunities to make convictions and aspirations real, they encourage autonomy in others to
seek opportunities, they are clear about agendas, and they aspire through logic and appeal to
shared ambitions.
Dennis and Meola (2009) found that transformational leaders help each member of their staff
grow and develop into leaders in their own right. They also help each individual to bring their
25

objectives and goals into alignment with those of the larger organization. Dennis and Meola
(2009) also found that the theory of transformational leadership included five components
necessary for a strong leader: communicating direction, inspirational motivation, problem
resolution, building the team, and trust. Trust, for Dennis and Meola (2009), is the very
foundation of any effective leader. Communicating direction is basically communicating goals to
all the stakeholders and followers. The leader has a vision and is able to articulate it to all.
Inspirational motivation is the ability to influence others. When leaders inspire, they motivate
and empower followers. Problem resolution for leaders is having the ability to challenge their
own thinking, challenge the status quo, and basically stimulate creativity to better handle
problems. Lastly, according to Dennis and Meola (2009), building the team involves developing
the followers to work better together as a group.
Transactional Leadership
Gallos (2008) stated that transactional leaders “approached their followers with an eye to
trading one thing for another -- job, votes, and subsidies for campaign contributions.” This style
of leadership starts with the idea that team members agreed to obey their leader totally when they
accepted a job. The transaction was usually the organization paying the team members in return
for their effort and compliance. The leader noted Gallos has a right to punish team members if
their work did not meet the predetermined standard (p.46).
Transactional leadership involves “helping organizations achieve their current objectives
more efficiently, such as linking job performance to value rewards and ensuring that employees
had the needed resources to get the job done” (McShane and Glinow, 2009, p.238). He stated
further that transactional leadership focuses on behaviors that improved employee performance
26

and satisfaction. Daft (2008) found that transactional leadership could be quite effective. He
stated that transactional leaders helped to build followers’ confidence and involved commitment
to follow the rules and that transactional skills are important for all leaders.
Transactional leadership is really a type of management technique, and not a true leadership
style because the focus is on short-term tasks (Mind Tools, 2010). Johannsen and Pors (2012),
found this approach emphasizes getting things done under the status quo umbrella, almost in
opposition to the goals of the transformational leadership. Transactional leadership is a “by the
book” approach in which leaders work within the rules. Aronson (2001) found these leaders to be
unconcerned with enhancing the growth and development of their followers. The author also
found that this type of leadership is characteristic of the greatest number of leader-follower
relationships.
Strategic Leadership
Strategic leadership is practiced by the military and many other large organizations. Strategic
leadership stresses the competitive nature of running an organization and being able to out fox
and outwit the competition (Leadership Styles, 2010). Adair (2009) stated that strategic
leadership is about the whole and not the parts. This style has three hallmarks: long-term,
importance, and multi-component. Adair (2009) defined long-term as an organizational strategy
that rarely takes into account short-term goals and is likely to be tactical rather than strategic.
Importance in an organization is knowing where it is going, and multi-component is a strategy
made up of various components.
Bennis (1992) found that one of the key functions of a strategic leader is to balance the
whole and the parts. There is not a formula for doing this because the leader is constantly
27

adjusting strategy. He also stated that for a strategic leader, knowing where the organization
should be going was one thing, and developing a strategy for getting there was another. He
stated that one decision that must be made is whether to pursue the vision alone or to seek
strategic alliances. Another decision is the choice of goals and objectives of what was intended to
be accomplished. In some organizations, according to Bennis (1992), the responsibility for
setting goals and objectives is widely dispersed, sometimes reaching right down to the workers.
Delegative Leadership
Daft (2008) found that delegative leadership could be effective when followers had very high
levels of education, experience, and readiness to accept responsibility for their own task
behavior. Leaders contended Daft, “provided a general goal and sufficient authority to the tasks
as the followers saw fit” (p. 86). For Oshagbemi (2003), delegative leadership is different from
the other leadership styles. Delegation is the “means by which senior manager’s pass on the jobs
of an organization to their lower-level managers” (p. 100).
Delegative leadership is sometimes referred to as laissez-faire leadership. In this style the
leader allows the employees to make the decisions. The leader is still responsible for the
decisions that are made. Employees under this type of leader are allowed to analyze situations
and determine what needs to be done, priorities are set, and tasks are delegated.
Authoritarian Leadership
Authoritarian leadership, according to the publication, leading through crisis (2009),
maximizes commitment to the organization’s goals and strategy. The authoritarian leader defines
standards that usually revolve around a vision. The authoritarian leader states the end and gives
people plenty of leeway to devise their own means, tells their employees what they want done,
28

how it is to be accomplished, and do not give advice or directions as to how it is to be done. The
authoritarian leadership style does not work in every situation because the approach may fail if a
leader is working with a team or peers who are more experienced than the leader. This style can
also be ineffective if the leader is overbearing. The authoritarian leadership style is used when
information is there to solve problems, the leader is short on time and the employees are
motivated.
Library Leadership
According to Fritts (2009), librarianship has been in a desperate struggle to find its soul and to
reinvent itself for the 21st century. Good management could carry organizations and libraries
through periods of stasis and stability, but change demanded that leadership take libraries from
where they are now to where they need to be or where they need to be but do not yet know it.
Fritts further noted the following issues that had to be considered by library leaders: digital
technology, demographic revolutions, bottom line competitive pressures, reduced funding from
all sources, leading from the middle, having responsibility rather than authority, resistance to
change, and separating one’s role as a leader from one’s role as a librarian and then being
conscious of the difference. Broome (2010) stated that upon “accepting leadership roles,
academic librarians would bring skills in partnering, administration, sharing information that
could build trust, lead to informed decisions, and promote good will and strength” (p.7).
Library Leaders’ Leadership Styles
Awan and Mahmood (2009), who conducted a study of the leadership styles of library
leaders, stated that the role of leadership was determined by the culture of the organization and
that the overall style of leadership was adopted based on beliefs, values, and assumptions. There
29

were several different leadership styles that could be identified in different leaders. Each style
had its own set of good and not so good characteristics. The author contended that the styles that
are most identified in leaders are autocratic, democratic, and laissez-faire. The autocratic leader
“dominated team members using unilateralism to achieve a singular objective and generally
resulted in passive resistance from team members requiring continuous pressure and direction
from the leader in order to get things done” (p.256 ). The democratic leader facilitated the team
by initiating tasks and giving them freedom to achieve at their own free will through mutual
understanding. A good democratic leader always promoted participation (Awan and Mahmood,
2009). The laissez-faire leader did not interfere in the affairs of its followers and participation of
this leader was very low; however, the team might struggle with lack of direction or motivation.
With these definitions in mind, Awan conducted his study of leadership styles of chief librarians.
He used a five-point Likert scale to determine the leadership styles of the chief librarians
(leaders) and found that most used the autocratic leadership style while only 7% fell into the
laissez-faire leadership style.

State of Academic Libraries Today
Writing in 1997, Riggs stated that academic libraries have become more complex, having to
reshape and renew themselves. Transformational leadership, therefore, was in great demand.
Excellent managers and transactional leaders were needed, but there had to be something extra in
order to lead libraries into the new century. Years later in 2008, this same author stated that
libraries would continue to undergo rapid change in the coming years. People who worked in
libraries had to learn to lead change. He further claimed that libraries have been over-managed
30

and under-led due to leadership being pushed aside and ignored. However, effective leadership
was crucial for success, and in the library profession, “one might encounter problems caused by
the lack of leadership qualities possessed by employees that are in managerial leadership
positions” (Allner, 2008, p.69).
In her research, Howard (2010) found that academic librarians had to demonstrate their
value. Academic libraries had to attract, retain, and train students. They also had to support
faculty research as well as enhance the institution’s reputation. According to Howard (2010),
academic libraries would not be able to demonstrate their institutional value until they could
define outcomes of institutional relevance and then measure the degree to which they can attain
them.
Castiglione (2009) found that technological change, budgetary constraints and the possibility
of personnel shortages have combined to create extraordinarily challenging times for academic
library administrators and their staff. He further stated that library leaders are making efforts to
utilize new management techniques that would encourage organizational learning and
adaptation. Libraries that are managed by traditional “command and control techniques” he
believed, may not be flexible enough to adapt their environment for continuous change. Riggs
(1997) found that some academic libraries have engaged in restructuring by eliminating some
long standing positions (e.g. assistant directors). Some have even gone entirely to team-based
structures and have reorganized themselves beyond recognition when compared to former
constructs. Restructuring was implemented to reduce bureaucratic constraints, increase
responsiveness to users, to allow more freedom and agility to act immediately on timely issues,
and to accommodate a new work culture and environment (Riggs, 1997). From a more current
31

perspective, Riggs made his observations, libraries and information centers have seen much
change and that the next 10 years would see even more change. In her view, the speed of change
and innovation was forcing organizations to abandon their top-down processes and the new
information channels were allowing decisions to be made at lower levels in the organization.
Employees are now working within the organization or library at all levels, and not just the
leaders, would be making decisions that would affect the library’s mission and future.
Nature of the Change
For libraries, transformational change was a welcome strategy. Transformational change
could be associated with the high-performance library. Simmons-Welburn (2008) stated that
transformation became an interactive process. For academic libraries, this has required managers
to pay attention to internal processes and external relations with and beyond the campus. In
recent decades, noted this author, libraries have been the site for considerable changes in the
delivery of information. Technology advances and changes in the professional workforce were
responsible for this. There were also transformations in the community of library users, diversity
of demographic character, and interdisciplinary and disciplinary interests. In response, many
libraries were still seeking transformative solutions (Simmons-Welburn, 2008).
The Changing Roles of Academic Libraries
Weiner (2003) found that the role of academic libraries had changed due to technological
advances and that the changes that have taken place in academic libraries may be better
understood by examining the theory of diffusion of innovation or structuration (Weiner, 2003).
According to Weiner, diffusion of innovation occurred by “using available channels of
communication on a social structure and was influenced by cultural values of the individual or
32

group” and he saw innovation as an “ongoing process where actions and institutional structures
were linked” (p.71). Structuration was a series of ongoing activities and practices that made up
or reproduced larger institutions. Libraries that have successfully introduced new services and
technologies are more easily adapted to innovations. Staff education about innovation provided
security to those involved in the process, and it fostered an environment of ongoing change that
would prove to be successful.
Weiner (2003) noted that librarians historically were focused more on preserving the past than
on inventing the future. Automation actually began to occur in libraries in the 1960s and a later
change began to occur in the mid to late 1990s. Library leaders learned that to survive they had
to add value to their customers and had to continuously evaluate their services.
Weiner (2003) stated that major changes in library operations were necessary for libraries to
become more user focused. New and advanced technologies were also necessary and had to be
in place to incorporate change. The library for Weiner was a growing organism, and growth
implied change. Libraries once were the sole gatekeepers of information, but now there are
databases that will allow persons to access information outside of the library. Libraries’ primary
objectives were once to provide traditional services that included but were not limited to
circulation, acquisitions, and cataloging; but with new technology, more services evolved. The
services that evolved included interlibrary loan, reference, research, distance library services,
web design, bibliographic instruction, and reserves. Lastly, Weiner (2003) found that changes in
organizational structures in libraries have been incremental in the past; but the changes that are
needed now required recognition that the former ways of doing things will not create and sustain
successful organizations and libraries.
33

The Challenges facing Academic Libraries today
American College and Research Libraries (ACRL) through its Research, Planning and
Review Committee issued a report in 2010 in which it addressed trends in academic librarianship
and higher education that are affecting academic libraries now and will in the future. The trends
that ACRL committee identified were:


Academic library collection growth is driven by patron demand and includes new
resource types. Budget reductions, user preferences for electronic access to materials,
limited physical space, and the inability to financially sustain comprehensive collections
have led to a shift from a “just in case” to “just in time” philosophy. Libraries now
recognize the need to collect, preserve, and provide access to digital datasets.



Budget challenges will continue and libraries will evolve as a result. Many libraries faced
stagnant or reduced operating and materials budgets for the fiscal year 2009-2010, and
the near future would likely bring more additional budget pressures.



A change in higher education requires that libraries possess diverse skill sets. As
technology progresses and changes, librarians needed to broaden their skills to provide
services to users. Librarians would need ongoing formal training to continue in the
profession.



Demands for accountability and assessment will increase. Academic libraries will be
required to demonstrate the value they provide to their clientele and the institution. This
was a part of the accountability movement along with higher education to show the value
of the college education and results of student learning outcomes.
34



Digitization of unique library collections will increase and require a larger share of
resources. Digitization projects made hidden and underused collections available to users
and researchers. These projects have been funded by grants and other sources but now
these digitization efforts might be affected by stagnant or reduced budgets as well.



Explosive growth of mobile devices and applications will drive new services. Librarians
and library leaders need to take into account the ubiquitous use of e-book readers, iPads,
smart phones, and other handheld devices in order to better serve patrons’ needs and the
preferences of academic programs at their institutions.



Increased collaboration will expand the role of the library within the institution and
beyond. Collaboration helped to maximize the efficient use of materials and resources.



Libraries will continue to lead efforts to develop scholarly communication and
intellectual property services. Academic libraries have recognized efforts to help
maximize use of resources and provide valuable and intellectual services.



Technology will continue to change services and required skills. Technology will
continue to affect nearly all library operations and services as well as how to access
resources.



The definition of the library will change as physical space is repurposed and virtual
space expands. Libraries have expanded their virtual space, reduced space within the
facility for collections, and re-purposed space for student use.

All of these trends pose a major challenge for leaders of libraries and are the heart and soul of
this research study.

35

How Roles have changed
A number of scholars with varying emphasis have weighed in on the manner in which the
roles of library leadership and the environment have changed. One of the roles of library leaders
was to provide continuous improvement in their services. In his 1997 study that is still relevant
today, Riggs argued that library leaders should create a constancy of purpose, should constantly
improve the system of production and service, institute training for all employees, adopt and
institute leadership, drive out fear, break down barriers between staff areas, remove walls that
rob people of pride in their work, encourage education and self-improvement for everyone, and
take actions to accomplish the needed transformation (Riggs, 1997). In a study published one
year later, Ramsden (1998) identified the following successful practices for leaders:


challenge the process: experiment, take risks, and learn from making mistakes



inspire a shared vision: vision is the force that invents the future



enable others to act: effective leaders turn followers into leaders



model the way: lead by example and live your values



encourage the heart: celebrate achievement

Other scholars have expanded on the findings of Riggs and Ramsden. O’Brien (2005) claimed
that library leaders are responsible for building organizations where people continually expand
their capabilities to understand complexity, clarify vision, and improve shared mental models.
Gresing-Pophal (2007) identified the roles and attributes of library leaders. They have
character, vision, passion, flexibility, finely-tuned communication and collaboration skills, the
ability to create value, and skills enhanced by a lifetime of learning. For Cameron and Green
(2008) library leaders are team builders who plan for and created short-term wins,
36

institutionalized new approaches, and empowered others to act. In short, library leaders have to
shape the future, make things happen, engage today’s talent, build the next generation, and invest
in themselves.
Staley and Malenfant (2010) has argued that the role of library leaders has changed in that
libraries have to reconsider what their relevance is in the research process. They have to reexamine their value and their importance to the university. Library leaders are no longer dealing
with libraries as a physical space; they have to deal with virtual libraries and access. Leaders are
faced with working with university departments and communities, and they have to collaborate
more with university departments accessing their services. Technology is playing an extremely
large part in the roles of library leaders and their libraries’ daily operations and services. Because
of the role of technology, library leaders have to adapt themselves and their organizations to
future change.

Major Leadership Theories and how they apply to changing roles of Library Leaders
Wang and Su (2010) provided a brief summary of some of the major leadership theories and
these were used to look at the changing role of library leaders.


Trait theory – some traits are particularly suited to leadership and some people make
good leaders based on a combination of traits.



Behavior theory – successful leadership is based on definable and learned behavior.



Participative leadership – involvement in decision-making improves understanding of
the issues by those who carry out the decisions; people are more committed to actions
when they are involved in the relevant decision-making
37



Situational leadership – the best action of the leader depended on a range of situational
factors.



Contingency theory – the leader’s ability to lead is contingent upon various situational
factors.



Transactional leadership – people are motivated by reward punishment and social
systems work best with a clear chain of command.



Transformational leadership -- people followed a person who inspired them and one who
has a vision and passion to achieve great things.

Wang and Su (2010) noted that the American Library Association recognized that there were
a multitude of differences that come into play in the workplace. They concluded that it is this
diversity of traits that contributed to a deeper level of understanding and competence.
Shoaf (2004) argued that library leaders applied theories based on the situation or tasks at
hand. In some instances they used methodologies based on a combination of theories. She found
that library administrators have restructured their organizations, that there are self-managed
groups that were performing more of the work, that email has replaced the printed memo in
communication, and that administrators have found that they no longer stand at atop the
hierarchy as their organizations have become flatter. Through these changes, argued Shoaf, a
new library leader is emerging. The new leader has different talents and a more supportive
mission. The need for knowledge of budgeting, personnel management, fundraising, and other
core responsibilities and activities still remain, but are now supplemented with an understanding
of the special skills that leading in the new library environment requires.

38

Library leaders sometimes complained about the rapid technological changes that they have
to deal with, but libraries are not the only organizations that have dealt with this issue. The new
library leader knows that change is good, understands that it must be managed, and looks outside
the profession for inspiration. This current study focused on the extent to which these new roles
were actually being played out by the library leaders who were interviewed.
Shoaf (2004) also contended that library leaders needed a vision of the future, and they must
be able to communicate that vision to the staff and the public. Some leaders have learned to
coach because they have learned to be facilitators and team players. Library leaders are always
about service, so they have to deal with ethics, positive customer interaction, and should be more
users focused. Shoaf (2004) stated that strategic plans usually chart the course for the
organization but they do not actually do the work. The library leader has to have the right staff
and it is the staff that gives the library its character. Lastly, as noted by Shoaf (2004), the
traditional management role of command and control has changed and some libraries are
experimenting with organizational structures that are flatter and place more emphasis on
collaborative administration. Better managed libraries, she concluded, made them nicer places to
work and provided better service to user constituencies (Shoaf, 2004).

Conclusion
Librarian leadership has and continues to undergo transformation. Casse and Claudel (2011)
stated, “you cannot lead people in the same way as was done in the past” (p.1). Library leaders
are guiding their organizations towards accomplishing their missions, which are integral to the
larger goals of their campuses. The leaders influence their organizations’ climate through their
39

leadership style. The leadership style that leaders choose to exercise is reinforced by the culture
and context of that institution (Amin, Saeedad, and Ijaz 2013).
Common to most leadership styles is the ability to influence others. The leader knows how to
inspire confidence in their employees and that helps to develop teamwork (Kippenberger, 2002).
There are four leadership styles that are most used and leaders will use a combination of all of
them based on the situation or tasks at hand. The climate within an organization often dictates its
leadership style (Gupta, 2011). This is evident in the manner in which decisions are made, how
crises are handled, and through the collection and utilization of information.
Librarian leadership styles and their impact on libraries have not been well studied. The
majority of the literature discussed various characteristics and traits of successful leadership. The
various characteristics and traits of each leadership style were combined, compared, and
intertwined so that the final result was an individual with vision, ethics, and other characteristics
that had an impact on the organization.
Library leadership influences the library environment. Leadership depends on character,
understanding of economics, changing technology, and expected impacts. Leadership needs to
demonstrate purpose, consistency, and determination in the use of evidence-based management
models. Leaders need to “walk the talk and transition from a competitive resource framework to
a collaborative model” (Lakos, 2007, p. 432). Tomorrow’s leadership of academic libraries is not
for the faint of heart, but for the professional that is dedicated to the opportunities of learning
organizations (Matthews, 2002).
There are as many leadership styles as there are leaders. However, one must know how to use
the right style with the right situation (Mind Tools, 2011). There are many different frameworks
40

that have shaped our understanding of leadership, and many have their place just as long as they
are used appropriately. There is no one “right” way to lead or manage all situations, but when
choosing the most effective approach, the following should be considered:


The skill levels and experience of the team



The work involved whether it is routine, new, and or creative



The organizational environment, whether it is stable, changing, conservative or
adventurous



Your preferred or natural style

Good leaders often switch between styles according to the people they lead and the work that
needs to be done. Establishing trust is essential as is balancing the need of the organization and
the needs of the team.
Library leaders are the primary decision makers. They are accountable for the success or
failure of their institutions and also “because of the influence they exerted on their staffs and on
the profession” (Lakos, 2007, p, 442). Lakos further stated that the leadership roles of library
leaders gave them a substantial commanding influence not only on the culture of the profession,
but also on the local institutional culture. The implication is that library leaders have leadership
styles that they have developed, and a skill set that usually is familiar and readily recognizable.
Library leaders like other leaders know that to be effective they have to focus on what is most
important. This includes making tough decisions and reducing or eliminating what is not
productive or increasing value to the organization.

41

In conclusion, the review of the literature compared the different leadership theories and styles
as well as the characteristics of leaders. It also examined the roles of libraries and their leaders
within the changing context of the academic library in the United States.

CHAPTER 3. METHODOLOGY
Introduction
This chapter includes the research design, target population, sampling, instrumentation,
data collection, field test, credibility, data analysis, limitations of the study, validity (internal and
external), transferability, expected findings, ethical issues, and chapter summation. This chapter
will also include information about the ethical considerations that the researcher followed while
conducting this study.
This qualitative study on leadership styles focused on comparing the different styles and
identifying some of the leadership attributes and characteristics and their impact. The study
involved a review of the literature, and face-to-face interviews with nine participants. The study
was designed to show the desirable characteristics and traits of effective library leaders and how
their leadership has led their institutions to survive and progress.
The qualitative research approach selected was a case study. Data collection methods
consisted of a narrative analysis of the literature and interviews from nine university library
leaders from one of the Southern states. All nine leaders were employed in public institutions. It
was anticipated that the library leaders would have many of the same concerns as were found in
the review of the literature. However, the library leaders handled their challenges somewhat
differently due to their administrative structure and the seriousness of their financial situation. As
noted in Chapter 2, different leadership styles and their characteristics have been studied, the
study of the application of these styles has been limited and this constituted a gap in the
literature. The goal of this study was to close or narrow the gap by providing relevant
information on the actual impact of leadership styles within libraries.
43

Research Design
The qualitative research design used was a case study. As noted by Creswell (2007), case
studies research involves “the study of an issue explored through one or more cases within a
bounded system which was a setting or context” (p.73). He further reported that case study
research has had a long history across many disciplines. The researcher interviewed nine library
deans and directors to discuss and determine their leadership styles. The library leaders received
information prior to the interviews which assisted them in defining how they led and the
approaches they used most.
Cottrell and McKenzie (2011) maintain that one of the advantages of a case study is the depth
of information that it provides. Case studies explore events, activities, individuals and they are
bound by time and activities as Creswell (2009) noted. The focus of this type of research is on
stories, situations, or events as reported by different individuals. Case studies help us understand
an issue and can extend experience or add strength to what is already known (Soy, 1997).
Hancock and Algozzine (2006) stated that case study research “represented a much broader
view” and sometimes focused on an individual group. For this study, the library leaders were
interviewed and this was a way to reinforce and evaluate findings. Case study research answers
questions and examines real life situations which are a basis for the application of ideas for the
study itself.
Hancock and Algozzine (2006) found that case study research is descriptive because it is
grounded in varied sources of information. The research object in case studies is often a person
or a group of people who are connected. This provides possibilities for questions and adds to the

44

complexity of the case study and leads to understanding of the case and answers the research
questions (Soy, 1997).
As noted by Hancock and Algozzine (2006), the case study approach shares similarities and
differences with other research methods. In contrast with experimental research, case study
research is more exploratory than confirmatory. This means that the researcher is seeking to
identify themes, events, and categories of behavior that prove relationships. This process
involves collecting and analyzing information from sources such as interviews, plus it requires
that the researcher spend time in the environment that is being investigated (Hancock and
Algozzine, 2006). Case study research creates additional opportunities for the researcher to
probe and explore additional questions by investigating the topic in more detail. It also
determines what is known and not known about the topic that is being researched.
Case study research often ends up “casting off preconceived notions and theories”
(Flyvbjerg, 2006, p. 219). In research, Yin (2009) states that case studies are used in situations
to contribute to the knowledge of individuals, groups, organizations, and social, political, and
related phenomena. In all of these situations, the need for case studies arose out of a need to
understand social phenomena. Case studies allow the researcher to retain the holistic
characteristics of real life events according to Yin (2009).
Case studies contain narratives of real life. The narratives might be difficult to summarize but
that is not a problem for the researcher (Flyvbjerg, 2006). It is a sign that the researcher had
uncovered more information that enriched the study. Narratives are included in the qualitative
research report because they help categorize the analysis.

45

Maxwell (2012) stated that design in qualitative research is an ongoing process. It involves
tacking back and forth between components of the design, assessing the implications of goals,
theories, research questions, methods, and the validity for one another. Qualitative research
design is like a sequence of planned actions that progressed by setting up opportunities.

Target Population
The population for the current study was library deans and library directors from one of the
South Atlantic states. The library deans and library directors selected for this study were
characterized as forward thinkers, and collaborators.

All were members of their state’s

University Library Advisory Council which is composed of 17 university library deans and
library directors. The group meets monthly for sharing information, planning, and responding to
concerns with their home universities. This organization of library deans and library directors
were all dedicated to providing the very best for their students, faculty, staff, and their university
communities.
The library deans and library directors have been in their leadership positions a minimum of
10 to 15 years. All of the library leaders were employed in public university settings and their
university libraries followed guidelines from their general administrators and their university’s
strategic plans. They all had the required educational credentials which consisted of masters’ or
doctoral degrees. Their graduate degrees in library science or information science along with
their doctoral degrees were all from accredited colleges and universities.
The library leaders had staff members ranging from a minimum of 10 to more than 100. Their
middle managers -- associate directors, associate deans, supervisors, coordinators, managers, and
46

support staffs -- all had master’s degrees in business administration or public administration.
Other staff members that did not have graduate degrees had earned a variety of bachelors and
associate degrees.
Library deans and directors were all active in professional local and state organizations, such
as friends of the library groups, and consortiums. They were all library activists and believed that
libraries were the center of the university and “the” place to go on their campuses.

Sampling Method
The sampling methods used were convenience and purposive. The researcher used
convenience as one method because the participants were available and accessible. Initially 10
library deans and library directors were selected from public institutions that were located within
driving distance from the researcher. One library leader declined to participate because of a busy
schedule. All of the nine administrators selected were part of the same governing organization,
which was an important justification for the sampling. This method of sampling assisted in
comparing the various leadership styles of the library leaders. The range of library experiences
and strategies used within each of the university settings assisted in clarifying the purpose, the
research problem, and the primary research question.
Purposive sampling was used because the library deans and directors represented and
experienced descriptive research based on real life situations. The library administrators selected
were women and men all over the age of thirty and who had been in library services a minimum
of 10 years. The sampling choice for this study was appropriate for addressing the purpose of the

47

research study and the research questions. The responses to the interview questions assisted in
further documenting library leaders’ impact of leadership styles on libraries.
All of the nine library deans and directors who agreed to participate signed the informed
consent forms. All of the participants had been in leadership positions a minimum of 10 years,
and most had been in leadership positions even longer. Most of the library administrators had
seen growth in the services at their university library. They all had seen growth in their staff,
additional space within their libraries, structural additions, new buildings, services, and
technology. Some had won awards for their libraries and the services provided.
Academic or university libraries as with all organizations in higher education are faced with
assessing their value, increasing their work, and being more accountable. The library deans and
directors selected for this study all had impressive library history, experiences, and success
stories. They all shared meaningful and useful information that could be used later for similar
situations. The library deans and directors agreed that library leaders that valued their employees
were the leaders that were most successful.

Instrumentation / Sources of Data
The researcher used 15 interview questions to assist in determining the leadership styles of
the library deans and directors. The library leaders were given a summary of the various
leadership styles prior to the interviews and some of the characteristics of each style. The
summary allowed the selected group the opportunity to review each style and then to assess
themselves and decide which style best suited them based on the information they had. Some of
them were already familiar with some of the leadership styles that they reviewed.
48

The interview questions were developed by the researcher. The researcher reviewed literature
that was available on the different leadership styles and also literature on determining one’s
leadership style. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) (Antonakis and Avolio,
2003) was one method for determining leadership style and its characteristics. The Multifactor
Leadership Questionnaire could also be used to assess the effectiveness of the leader’s
organization.
The studies conducted through the years on personal characteristics have made it clear that
many traits contribute to leadership (Northhouse, 2010). Some of the traits that were identified
from the questions were integrity, intelligence, self-confidence, determination, and sociability.
The findings from the study on leadership and leadership styles have provided some benchmarks
for all leaders that could help evaluate one’s personal leadership attributes.

Data Collection Procedures
A letter inviting the library leaders to participate (Appendix A) was sent to each selected
library leader. Emails and phone conversations followed and then interview dates were suggested
and confirmed. The informed consent forms were signed and returned. The consent forms
included a confidentiality clause and a statement of anonymity. All information received
remained confidential and coded along with the names of the universities and the participants’
names remained anonymous. The interview schedules were finalized and campus visits began
and continued early in the spring and summer until all interviews were completed.
Structured interviews were conducted with each library leader at their location to discuss
leadership, leadership styles, their libraries, administrations, their chain of command, and their
49

organizational structures. The interviews consisted of 15 questions created by the researcher. The
questions sought to collect data to determine the library deans and directors’ experience, skills,
attributes, strategies, and actions plans as to how their libraries had progressed and sustained in
their academic environments and through economic times.
In addition each library leader was provided information regarding various leadership styles
and the key traits of each prior to the interviews. A discussion was held with leaders regarding
these styles. Once these discussions were concluded, participants focused on their leadership
styles and if they were based on situations in their environment. The interview questions were
designed to allow further discussion and the library leaders responded to each interview question
and also elaborated on issues related to the stated questions. Several leaders stated if additional
information was needed, then the researcher should contact them again. Some library leaders
shared additional information that was relevant to their leadership and leadership style such as
information on leadership or management workshops, webinars, meetings, forums, or summaries
from various libraries. Data collection in this case study was an interactive process between the
researcher and the participants that led to new and additional data received from the interviews.
Once the interviews were recorded on the tape recorder, the data was saved on a flash drive
and stored and locked in a cabinet. Notes were taken by the researcher and later stored in the
locked cabinet as well.
Field Test
The interview was the instrument that helped to determine the leadership styles of the library
leaders and their impact. Prior to the interviews, the interview questions were reviewed, assessed
for clarity, appropriateness, and information sought by a few persons from one academic campus
50

group. The individuals that reviewed the questions were only asked to provide feedback and not
to answer the questions.
The instrument consisted of 15 questions that requested information on the library leaders’
leadership style, their experience, accomplishments, strengths, weaknesses, and their strategies
for their libraries’ continued stability and growth. The instrument discussed attributes, skills,
techniques, and information that may assist them when dealing with staff, administrators, faculty,
and the students. Conducting the interviews helped the researcher to understand leadership and
leadership styles, its possible impact on libraries and other organizations, and they helped to
answer the research questions as well.
Pilot Test
A pilot test was not done because it was not previously approved by IRB.

Data Analysis Procedures
This study used themes to analyze the data collected from the interviews. Thematic analysis
emphasized examining and recording themes within the data. The themes that were most used
became categories for the analysis. Coding was the process for developing the themes within the
data. A series of codes were used for common themes which were the styles of leadership.
The data was collected from the interview questions. The researcher asked each participant the
fifteen questions and the responses were tape recorded and the researcher took notes. The
interviews were transcribed after each interview by the researcher and codes assigned.
Notes were taken as the participants were responding to the questions. There were some
occasions wherein the researcher asked the participant to explain further or if they cared to
51

elaborate. Some of the participants had the same responses for the same questions. A narrative
analysis was used for the data collected. This method of analysis was driven by the apparent
theories on leadership and the research questions.

Limitations of the Research Design
The major limitation of the research design through the use of interviews was the number of
participants that took part in the study, and the location of the participants in a single state. The
small sample size certainly restricts the applicability of the findings. A larger number of
participants would have increased the number of leadership styles and well as increased the
number of leadership styles that were used. Including more states would increase the sample
population which would also increase the findings.

Credibility
The researcher completing the study checked for the accuracy of the findings. The researcher
ensured that the research design was presented and carried out fairly by not asking questions that
could show partiality. The researcher remained impartial and did not socialize with the
participants nor did the researcher comment or give personal views on any of the questions.
Descriptive validity included what the researcher read and reviewed in the available literature.
This review of the literature provided a better understanding of the findings from the participants
interviewed. The responses from the interview questions along with the participants’ experience
assisted with the credibility and reliability in the conclusions drawn from the study.

52

The researcher assumed throughout the interview process that those being interviewed were
providing credible and honest answers to the questions. Often during the interview the
participants would stop the interview to clarify that the researcher fully understood what the
participants had conveyed. This was to ensure a certain level of accuracy and transparency.

Transferability
The data collected from this study could lead to further research on leadership styles from
more library deans and directors in more states and to different types of libraries. Academic
libraries were the libraries selected for the study, but other library leaders from public libraries,
special libraries, and school libraries could benefit from this type of research study.
Leadership styles are present and used in all libraries and the impact of those styles in
different types of libraries could be of interest. The findings from this research could contribute
to a broader knowledge on leadership styles, its impact, and the benefits as well as the ineffectiveness or barriers of each style.

Expected Findings
The expected findings of the research were to gain knowledge on the leadership styles,
qualities, and traits of library leaders and to see the impact of those leadership styles in libraries.
The interviews helped the researcher to understand the leadership styles and the individual
experiences and decisions that had to be made based on circumstances at the time. The library
leaders’ responses helped to address the research questions in that strategies and action plans

53

were discussed that spoke to some of the challenges that are faced in higher education and in
libraries as well.
Interviews were selected for this research because they were the most effective approach in
acquiring the most insightful data from those being interviewed. The interviews allowed the
researcher the opportunity to clarify and probe for additional information (Bloomberg and Volpe,
2008). Interviews allowed the participants the opportunities to elaborate and to bring out
information from other sources such as workshops, conferences, or from past experiences that
could be relevant and valuable.
Additional expected findings of the research were that library deans and directors would
determine the styles that worked best with various situations. This group would also share and
compare effective strategies used within their university libraries. The research findings were to
substantiate that no one leadership style is best. Leadership styles along with certain leadership
competencies are very essential for libraries and other organizations to be productive.

Ethical Issues
Mertens (2005) stated that ethics was an integral part of any research project and ethical
considerations had to be present throughout the entire research process. According to the
Belmont Report in 1997 (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare), it was vital that the
researcher follow ethical principles and guidelines for the protection of all human subjects of
research. Guidelines were needed to guard against deception and to protect privacy. The Belmont
Report suggested three principles that should be followed: respect, which meant treating subjects
with respect and courtesy, and protecting those individuals who may have reduced autonomy,
54

which included but was not limited to the elderly, children and prisoners; justice ensures that
subjects are treated reasonably and fairly and are not exploited, especially those in a vulnerable
population; beneficence was about doing no harm, maximizing good outcomes for the
participants and minimizing any danger for the subjects. This was completed not as an act of
sympathy, but due to an actual obligation of the researcher.
Special attention was given to privacy and confidentiality issues to briefing and debriefing
the participants, and to obtaining full consent for all persons involved. The researcher did not
solicit personal information from any of the participants. The integrity of the research was
monitored by the researcher to help ensure that ethical practices were followed and maintained
through the study. Precautions were taken to maintain the study’s validity. The principle
objective the researcher adhered to was the provision of an analytical context that provided a
resolution to any possible ethical problems that could have arisen during the research involving
human subjects.
All participants were asked to sign an informed consent form, which told the participant about
the nature of the research, the benefits and the risk. It also ensured that the participant fully
understood the information with regards to the study.
Summary
This study involved a qualitative approach using the case study method. The qualitative
approach deals with descriptions and with data that could be observed but not measured. The
researcher understood and interpreted social interaction.
The research was based on the research questions, 15 interview questions, and nine
participants. Each participant was asked 15 questions during each interview. They all answered
55

each question as well as offered additional information that arose in the course of the interviews.
All information shared was relevant to leadership styles and the possible impact of those styles
on libraries.
Excellent management skills are the core foundation of any organization. Though the research
on leadership in general is quite extensive, there is only limited research on the actual leadership
styles of library leaders today. There is an abundance of information on the characteristics and
attributes that library leaders should possess.
This study attempted to close the gap. The case study method was proposed because it was
an approach that could accommodate a variety of perspectives and obtain data from participants
who formed part of a group experience (Merriam, 1988). Case studies are strategies that allowed
the researcher to explore and to collect more information. This study allowed the researcher to
gain relevant information and important background data on a particular subject. This research
involved an evaluation that helped establish the various impacts of leadership styles on libraries.

56

CHAPTER 4: DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
Introduction
The purpose of this qualitative case study was to compare and explore the different
leadership styles of library deans and library directors and to see how they thought their
leadership style had impacted their libraries. This study was conducted by reviewing the
literature that was available and interviewing the library deans and directors face-to-face for
sessions lasting at least an hour or more. All individuals that were involved in the study agreed to
be interviewed, they all signed the informed consent form, and they agreed to have their sessions
taped.
This chapter analyzes the data and addresses the research questions. Responses to the
interviews were organized, analyzed, and common themes emerged and were identified. These
themes enabled the researcher to gain a better understanding of the leadership styles used by the
library leaders who participated in this study.
The researcher selected the participants and all of the participants were asked a series of
questions that produced interesting responses, additional discussions, meaningful dialogue, and
additional information relevant to the study. The responses to the questions suggested strategies
to be used in the participants’ library environment.
Description of the Sample
The participants in the study consisted of nine library deans and library directors in one of the
South Atlantic states in the United States. The participants all had the required credentials of a
Master’s degree in library science or information science with either one additional master in
another discipline, along with some having their doctoral degrees. All of the participants had a
57

minimum of 10 years or more as being an accomplished library administrator. The participants
were all members of one recognized organization within their state from which they were
selected.

Table 1 highlights the gender and how many of the library deans and directors were female and
male.

_____________________________________________________________________________
The largest percent of participants were female, and the smaller percent were male. They all
consented to being a part of the study and to sharing their responses, ideas, knowledge,
perceptions, experiences, and strategies for continued growth for their libraries.

Research Methodology and Analysis
The qualitative research design used for this research is case study. Case studies arose out of
a need to understand what works and is conducive to the overall academic environment. This
allowed the researcher to investigate real events in the academic setting (Yin, 2003). This case
study focused on exploring issues of leadership styles of library deans and library directors and
the impact of those leadership styles on their libraries.

58

The data was collected by interviewing nine library deans and directors. The researcher went
to eight locations within one of the South Atlantic states in the United States and one interview
was done through Skype. Notes were taken and recorded conversations were saved on a flash
drive.
The interviews were very informative and useful. They provided opportunities to acquire
additional information regarding leadership and leadership styles. The interviews were
completed based on the participants’ responses to questions. They were all very knowledgeable
about libraries and library services.
In this qualitative study, the researcher was the instrument of the data analysis (Jacelon and
O’Dell 2003). The ability to interpret the data and present the findings makes the research study
useful and provides answers to the research questions. The data analysis was based on the
research questions and was guided by the researcher exploring the literature available along with
data collected to answer both the research questions and the interview questions.
The data collected was sorted and managed according to the questions and the responses.
The analysis of the study required that the researcher put aside any preconceived ideas and just
deal with the facts. As the data collected was conveyed as findings, the researcher presented the
findings or results so that they may be useful to academic Library Leaders in Higher Education.

59

Summary of the Findings
Research question:
How did library leaders of academic libraries respond to the challenges posed by
dramatically changing circumstances and conditions within American higher education?
Subquestion 1: How have library leaders had to adjust their leadership styles and
strategies to meet these new challenges?
Subquestion 2: What leadership styles and strategies have been most effective in
meeting these changing circumstances?
Subquestion 3: What leadership styles and strategies have proven to be ineffective?
The responses listed were provided by the participants and were paraphrased and
summarized by the researcher. Some responses were short and to the point, and some went into
more detail. Upon completion of the interviews, all participants said if more information was
needed they would be willing to be contacted again.
Interview Questions

based on a situation or an issue at the time?
Question 5: Does the leadership style of the Provost or Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs
affect you when making a decision within the library?
60

Question 6: What type of situations or directives may cause you to use a different leadership
style?
Question 7:

Given the basic four leadership styles-autocratic, bureaucratic, laissez-faire, and
charismatic, what styles do your managers most use when dealing with their
departments?

Question 8:

On a scale of 1-10, how do you think your management team would score your
leadership style?

Question 9: Had you had to share information that you knew would cause a difference in
opinion, what was the approach that was used, the objectives, and procedures
used for handling the issues at hand?
Question 10: What leadership styles have influenced you the most and why?
Question 11: What situations and circumstances have challenged your leadership?
Question 12: What values do you demonstrate daily as a leader?

Democratic – collaborative, listens to colleagues, no decisions are made in a vacuum

G

Situational – it is important to respond to staff and their needs

H

Democratic – very knowledgeable

I

Participative

This question attempted to get leadership styles that the library leaders are actually using in their
day-to-day work. The responses reveal that more than a quarter of the participants opted for a
democratic style of leadership.

however, there were a small percentage that stated that their leadership style had not changed.

65

Table 6. Administration’s impact on library leaders’ decision-making
Question: Does the leadership style of the provost or vice chancellor of academic affairs affect
you when making a library-related decision?
Participants

Responses

A

Maybe in the way that you present to the staff and the manner that they respond to
the requests

B

Our Provost is transformative and democratic, so probably not, but did try to
understand their leadership changes, because research documents them

C

Absolutely, sometimes you don’t know, and there are times when you run major
decisions by them, and it is dead in the water

D

Yes with personnel-now feels somewhat more comfortable with the Provost

E

Sure, wishes to please them because they never know anything about the library, so
they usually had freedom to move the library forward and work on student success,
retention and focus on the students

F

Yes absolutely, being innovative and thinking outside of the box and outside of the
library

G

Absolutely, my position reports to the Provost, and the Provost and Chancellor sets
the tone and the priorities for the campus at large

response, change of administrators happens, but is sort of laissez-faire

I

No the leadership style of the Provost does not affect me when it comes to making
decisions within the library, so my leadership style has not changed

The majority of the participants’ responses were stated positively that their leadership style is
affected by the Provost or Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs. Only a very few of the
participants stated, that their leadership styles are not affected by the Provost or Vice Chancellor
of Academic Affairs.

66

Table 7.Situations that impact leadership style

Question: What type of situations or directives may cause you to use a different leadership style?
Participants

Responses

A

Had to transform the first floor to 24 hours five days a week, had to do something
different, the look was different but there was a lot of duplication

B

Staff, personnel, recommendations for promotions, guiding principles, state
regulations, budget detail, the faculty handbook, the bureaucratic style comes into
play with the budget

C

If you had not been interested in change- some situations came up and you had
no choice, it’s going to happen

D

When not working – talk to them, sometimes you had to re-think and visualize
situations-because we are here to work with the students

E

Emergency situations

F

Expectations and restraints outside, lacked leadership, and had an agenda and
hired IT

G

Budgetary restraints

H

Legal issues with patrons or staff, safety issues or reasons, had to be more
autocratic with copyright and protection of patron records, and short turn-around
issues

I

Saw that all staff members were not pulling their fair load, resulted to the
transformational style, does not believe in making excuses and preferred not to
have excuses brought to them

Different situations and directives caused the participants to use different leadership styles.
Some of the directives were issues wherein the participants had no choice but to adjust their
styles.

Table 8. Leadership styles most often used among department managers/supervisors
Question: Given the basic four leadership styles -- autocratic, bureaucratic, laissez-faire,

and

charismatic -- what styles do your managers most use when dealing with their departments?
Participants
A

Responses
It varies- see a lot of bureaucratic with some supervisors, some are right by the book and
may not share, some had the attitude that “I am the supervisor and I am doing it my way”

B

Coordinators do not use the autocratic style, they use transformative, and delegative

C

Public Services- bureaucratic, Technical Services and Special Collections-laissez-faire,

D

Charismatic, laissez-faire, had supervisors that do not want to hear from the staff

E

Access Services uses more bureaucratic, Reference and Information Commons uses more
charismatic and laissez-faire

F

Depends on the people-some collaborative and the others are autocratic and charismatic

G

None of these

H

More democratic and laissez-faire

I

This is a difficult question because each manager comes with a different style, but in
choosing one of the styles, would say that the managers use the laissez-faire leadership
style when dealing with their departments

The research participants spoke freely about their leadership within their libraries and how
they felt their impact had been. The participants felt they contributed to the overall success of
their past and present employment.

76

The information shared addressed the research question and the sub-questions will follow.

The Research Question: How are library leaders of academic libraries responding to the
challenges posed by dramatically changing circumstances and
conditions within American higher education?
Subquestion 1: How have library leaders had to adjust their leadership styles and
strategies to meet new challenges?
Subquestion 2: What leadership styles and strategies have been most effective in
meeting these changing circumstances?
Subquestion 3: What leadership styles and strategies have proven to be in-effective?

According to the Research Information Network, and the Society of Colleges and University
Libraries, academic libraries demonstrated their abilities to lead and adapt their roles in response
to changing circumstance (RIN, 2010). They supported the teaching, learning, and research
missions of their individual universities. They also responded to the periods of financial stresses,
and demonstrated that their services are effective and valuable to the students and staff. They
found ways of doing things differently and in addition, they had to re-think what their libraries
do.
The responses from the participants included changing their leadership style to fit the situation,
re-thinking and visualizing the situations, and dealing with state regulations and guiding
principles. Participants also dealt with budget crisis, reductions in personnel, retirements, and
resignations, but maintained consistent services, and reached their goals and objectives. Several
77

of the participants had Friends of the Library groups that could assist by having events, fund
raising activities, and some had written grants that assisted with major programs.
Different situations have caused library leaders to adjust their leadership style to the situation.
In some situations wherein they may have been more democratic or autocratic, they have had to
use the bureaucratic style more because rules and guidelines had to be followed.
The responses from the participants (C, G, H, and A) from Question 4, were relevant to the
sub-question. The participants stated that there were times wherein they had to deal with legal
issues and rules had to be enforced, so they had to change their leadership style to be more
bureaucratic. There are state laws, as well as guidelines and principles that had to be followed so
leaders had to adjust their leadership style to the situation.
Transformational leadership provided an effective and transformed way of thinking about
leadership that aimed to achieve the objectives of the organization and removed the barriers that
confronted productivity (Hassan and Ismail, 2013). Strategic leadership has been effective in
meeting goals because strategic leaders know where the organization should be headed and so
they usually develop strategies for getting the organization there. The democratic leadership style
is not appropriate when there is need to implement change or to resolve problems; because the
leaders feel that everyone should have a voice or provide input, and there is not always time to
do that. Authoritarian leadership will not work in many situations if the information is not there
to solve the problems.
According to the literature, the leadership styles that have proven to be most unproductive were
the autocratic leadership style, democratic, and the laissez-faire. Autocratic leadership style does
not allow the employee to have a voice. Democratic leadership style allows everyone a voice;
78

however, there is no distinct leader. Laissez-faire style of leadership consists of hands off and or
leave-it-be. Charismatic leadership instead believes in empowering their colleagues to ensure
them they believe they are competent and have the opportunity to grow.
Summary
This chapter addressed the research questions. Nine participants responded to the 15
interview questions that were asked. Among the responses, there was consistency in upholding
the mission and visions for their libraries. All of the participants focused on what was best for the
library and their users.
The leadership styles discussed by the library leaders provided insight into how and why
they had been as successful as they were. The leaders assessed themselves, their work, their
experiences, challenges, outcomes, and their leadership has had an impact on their libraries.
The academic library is tied to teaching, learning, research, general assistance, and support to the
students, faculty, and staff. The contextual factors of leadership had a great deal of impact on the
leadership qualities that was necessary to be effective. The leaders that were interviewed had
many of the same leadership qualities. It can be stated that leaders takes on the style of
leadership that best fits the setting in which the followers and leadership interact (Mahdinezhad,
Suandi & Omar, 2013).
The data collected showed that the library leaders used many of the same leadership styles and
they used different leadership styles for different situations. No one style worked for every
situation. Styles were adjusted for situations that involved policies, legal matters, patron rights,
and the leaders used some of the same styles for those situations.

CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
Introduction
This chapter provides an overview and interpretation of the data from the participants. All
of the participants in the study were accomplished library administrators. The researcher
conducted interviews at the individual library deans’ or library directors’ university library.
The purpose of this qualitative case study was to compare and determine the different
leadership styles of library leaders and the impact of those styles on their libraries. The desirable
leadership traits and attributes necessary for library leaders in university settings to function
effectively were addressed. The library deans and directors identified some of the challenges that
they had to face with the declining support for institutions of higher learning.
Libraries are changing therefore the leaders are changing and the leaders had to be more
aggressive in fulfilling their academic support roles. The library deans and library directors had
to re-think what the library does and then do things differently.
The qualitative research method was the case study. The source for collecting the data
included an in-depth review of information from the scholarly literature as well as focus
interviews. The interviews were structured and all of the participants were asked 15 questions.
The responses and the participants were coded. Several themes of leadership and leadership
styles were expressed throughout the focus sessions.
Chapter 5 covers discussions of summary of the findings, discussions of the findings,
discussion of the findings in relation to the literature, limitations, implication of the findings for
practice, recommendations for further research and the conclusion to the qualitative research.
80

There are discussions of the literature as well as discussions of the research questions and
interview questions. A summary of the research study as well as answers to the research
questions is provided in this chapter.

Summary of the Findings
The focus of this study was to determine: How are library leaders of academic libraries
responding to the challenges posed by dramatically changing circumstances and conditions
within American higher education?

First, leaders of academic libraries were constantly

responding to the changing circumstances and conditions within American higher education
because the role of academic libraries is constantly being questioned. At one time, academic
libraries were the place to go for learners and those persons that were involved in research but
now; it is not necessary for those persons to even go to the library; they can do most of the same
work on the internet. Library deans and directors have had to strategically think continuously
about balancing expenditures on information resources on one hand, staffing on the other, how to
sustain existing levels of service, and develop new services to meet new needs. They have had
their book budgets reduced along with their electronic resources and e-book collections; and
finally, have had to figure out how and what to sustain within their print journal collections (Rin,
2010).
Library leaders have had to adjust their leadership styles and strategies to meet new
challenges, and they have had to adopt various situational leadership strategies. Each year
situational differences contributed to the library leaders’ leadership effectiveness-be they within

81

the library itself or within their parent organization. The effectiveness of the library leader was
related slightly to the performance of the organization and its services.
As noted by the participants, the leadership styles and strategies that had been most effective
in meeting the changing circumstances have been transformational and bureaucratic. One of the
major tasks now for academic library deans and library directors is to ensure that the library
maintains a healthy balance between focusing on the present and the future and to maintain the
importance and value of the library and its services.
The participants acknowledged that some leadership styles and strategies prove to be effective
such as: autocratic (do as I say), laissez-faire (do-nothing) and democratic (letting everyone have
input into decisions). The participants also acknowledged those leadership styles that were ineffective and the reasons for their in-effectiveness.
Discussion of the Findings
The research participants in the study identified their leadership styles and how they used and
incorporated their styles of leadership within their libraries. Leadership was critical in the
implementation of transforming actions for most organizations. According to the findings, there
are no magic formulas for a successful leadership style, however, there were some lessons and
suggested characteristics that improved the likelihood of success. Those lessons were as follows:
adaptability, flexibility, listen and learn and know how to communicate, care for people and the
job, get the best out of people, set the example, develop a repertoire of competencies, keep
developing your emotional intelligence, no style without substance-leadership requires a wide
range of abilities, and finally, make that sure your leadership style was designed to bring out the
best in your people.
82

The participants in the study all had worked in environments that presented a positive climate
for their patrons and staff. All of the library deans and library directors during their tenure as
leaders in their university libraries had contributed to the growth of their libraries, they all had
situations wherein they used similar leadership styles for similar situations, all demonstrated
many of the same values daily as leaders, and they all shared some of their greatest
accomplishments while being leaders. Many of the library deans and library directors had been
most successful in getting new libraries, new services, great reviews from (SACS) Southern
Association of Colleges and University Systems, newly renovated Instruction Lab, very active
Friends of the Library Groups, getting the first generation of computers and getting technology
started, renovation of an undergraduate library, changing one floor into a technological dream for
students’ use, and additional library space to upgrade and extend services.
Positive outcomes were produced from all of the participants in the study. Conversations
with them showed that they played a central role in the continued life of their university libraries.
They all had experienced change and had transformed their operations to respond to the
opportunities of technology within their libraries. They were all aware of the financial climates
and they addressed these challenges as well as others in higher education. Academic library
deans and directors demonstrated their abilities to lead their libraries and adjust their roles in
response to whatever changes and challenges they encountered.

Discussion of the Findings in Relation to the Literature
The major themes that emerged from the participants’ responses were that there are different
leadership styles for different situations. As found in the literature, leadership and leadership
83

styles are found in all organizations; but, the importance of its impact on libraries has not been
talked about. The literature spoke about the characteristics, the competencies, and the qualities
that were desirable for library leaders to be successful, but less about the application of various
leadership approaches.
The roles of libraries have changed as well as the perceived value of the library. Libraries
today are driven by evolving technology as well as economic issues, personnel issues, and social
realities. The challenge for library deans and directors was to define their specific goals and
visions, acquire as many management and leadership skills as possible, and to know when to use
them to influence others to reach the necessary expected outcomes (Leading through a crisis,
2009).
The findings from this study were useful for library deans and library directors to identify
their leadership styles. Identification of their leadership style and what could work for general or
specific situations may allow for more productive staff and library programs.
Being adept in recognizing leadership styles may enable library professionals to develop their
skills to become better leaders as well as improve relationships with colleagues and other leaders
(Giltinane, 2013).
Limitations
The library deans and directors that were selected for the research study provided
meaningful and interesting data for the study. All of the library deans and directors were well
established as administrators. Ten library leaders were selected to participate in the study, and all
of them did except for one. The one leader that did not participate stated that she did not have

84

time to do an interview. The other nine library deans and library directors did participate and
provided very relevant responses to the interview questions.
The findings were limited due to the number of participating library deans and library
directors. The findings from the current study would have been more in depth and more data
collected and shared, had there been more library deans and library directors participating in the
study. However, it is not clear that the findings would have been markedly different because of
the situational nature of library leadership today.
The literature has not clearly addressed the gap that was stated early on in the study. There is
literature that addresses leadership styles for many organizations; but, there is still not an
abundance of information on the leadership styles of library deans and library directors. The
majority of the literature still does not address the impact of leadership styles on libraries. There
is literature on leadership, but according to Jenkins (2012), library administration has recently
grown into an area of interest.
Libraries like any organization, requires more than just efficient management, they require
leadership. As libraries struggle to decide what is best to meet the informational needs,
library administrators struggle to find the best way to lead in a changing profession (Jenkins,
2012). Few leaders had all of the leadership styles, and even fewer knew when and how to use
them all; but, the good leader usually, will make every effort to construct a team with individuals
who displays leadership styles that they lack (Goleman, 2004).
Implication of the Findings for Practice
Based on the findings from this study, library deans and library directors have shown that the
more styles they exhibit, the better. The most effective leaders are flexible among the styles
85

based on the situation at the time. The literature states that library leaders were sensitive to the
impact that they are having on others, and that they adjust their style to get the best results
(Goleman, 2004).
Leaders that provide effective leadership must focus on providing the right balance. Concerns
must be weighed by addressing operational concerns versus human resources. Library deans and
directors in academic libraries have demonstrated their abilities to lead and to adapt their roles in
response to the changing circumstances. Academic libraries play a major role in supporting the
teaching, learning, and research mission which is very important for students and the entire
university (RIN, 2010).
According to Goleman, “the most effective executives use a collection of distinct leadership
styles – each in the right measure, at just the right time” (Goleman, p.1, 2004). Library deans and
library directors as administrators use a collection of leadership styles as well. Use of the
different leadership styles when put into action or practice, usually pays off in performance.
Libraries need more than leaders and leadership; they need the right kinds of each as was
stated by Germano (2010). According to Germano, “for libraries to remain viable as institutions
and to add value to the constituents that they serve, “a library’s leadership must change, develop
its employees, and it must provoke customer commitment,” along with maintaining the most
current and up to date technology.
Recommendations for Further Research
Based on the current findings in the research, it is recommended that library deans and
library directors adapt their style to fit the different circumstances. Library leaders have
demonstrated their abilities to lead and to respond to different circumstances. It would be of
86

interest to survey more library deans and library directors in other types of libraries and library
environments to see what their leadership style is and to see the impact that their leadership style
has had on their library. It also would interesting to see if this research related to
the success of student learning outcomes.
The findings from this research suggest that library deans and library directors should
share ideas and experiences to test what works. Library leaders should also “exploit the potential
for co-operation in developing a range of shared services in order to enhance efficiency” (RIN,
2010). Collaborating and building partnerships across the university sector should be essential
for libraries due to current budgetary situations and as an opportunity to promote change, share
ideas, and expand services.
Leadership will never be an exact science, but neither should it be a mystery to those that
practice it daily. The Library is an environment that is changing continuously, so library deans
and library directors must utilize their leadership styles like a pro- using the right one at the right
time and in the right measure – because the payoff is in the results. library deans and library
directors must articulate strategies for the library based on the needs of the university.
Conclusion
Leadership has a direct cause and effect on organizations and their success. The leaders
determine the value, the culture, the tolerance level, and employee motivation. The one common
theme that emerged from the literature is that successful leaders have one goal, to influence those
persons that are around them so that they can benefit from the resources.
Libraries require the same strategy. Library deans and library directors affect everything
from the experiences with the patrons, the mission of the library, resources, services provided,
87

the collection, the technology, and the overall climate of the library. The success of the libraries
depends upon its leadership and leadership style plays an important role. The overall university
administration and their support of the library affect the success or failure of the library leaders.
Leaders have a great responsibility in all organizations.
The most effective leaders as stated before demonstrate flexibility in the leadership styles
they use. Leadership styles were reflected in behaviors and attitudes according to Kippenberger
(2002). As stated by Kippenberger, leadership and leadership styles were difficult to pin down,
but there is no right way or the best way. It is up to the individual and the situation at the time.
Leaders had the ability to inspire people and they can do this by setting an example, showing
enthusiasm, commitment, integrity, and by being able to communicate.
The study of leadership styles of library leaders and the actual role of leadership as stated by
Awan (2009) was determined by the culture of the organization, the style of leadership, beliefs,
values, and assumptions. Each style has its good and bad characteristics, and when using a style,
the situation will still determine the style that is used.
The research questions that guided this study were: “how are library leaders responding to
the challenges posed by changing circumstances and conditions within American higher
education?” The library deans and library directors now are communicating to all of their
stakeholders the library’s value to the academic community. They are demonstrating that they
are contributing to students and faculty recruitment, retention, and success. The library leaders
are adhering and using the ACRL (American College and Research Library) standards as a base
for the trends in academic libraries. Library leaders are continuously writing grants, and they
have good support from the Friends of the Library Group and other organizations that support
88

the library. They are also doing what they need to do to sustain services and meet the needs of
new and changing users along with meeting the missions and strategies of their university.
In conclusion, library deans and library directors have used various leadership styles and
there are instances wherein they may need to use more than one style to be effective. In using the
different styles, the library leaders must be flexible and aware of the different characteristics of
the styles used as well as the situation, so the results are in the best interest of the organization
and the persons involved.
This research was designed to present recommendations to guide library deans and library
directors in the process of determining their leadership style and the possible impact that their
leadership style may be having on their university library. There is no right or wrong style, but
the style used can impact your library, your staff, the students, faculty, and the university
community.
From this study, there is no precise leadership style that fits every situation in the work
environment. One must learn to adjust their leadership style; the library deans and directors had a
significant impact on their library staff and how well they performed under their leadership.
What was learned from this study was one’s colleagues should be priority. Leaders must exhibit
a bureaucratic smartness in order to be effective. Democratic leaders are important
and they to allow colleagues to be a part of the decision making process, by doing this it
establishes flexibility and accountability.
The recommendation is that this study be expanded to more prominent library
organizations, such as American Library Association and North Carolina Library Association

89

and all the sub-committees. In expanding the study it will allow an alternate view of the different
leadership styles, aptitude, competencies, and self-awareness.
