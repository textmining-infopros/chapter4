Abstract

This study, which contributes to the scant research on personal values in the library
profession, examines the core values and the related defining moments o f 12 public library
directors who work in rural, suburban, and urban settings throughout the United States. The
participants, recognized as managerial leaders in public libraries, oversee some o f the highest use
libraries per capita in the country. They share common values o f benevolence, self-direction, and
universalism as identified by the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQIV).
The second methodology, narrative inquiry, examined life stories to identify common
critical incidents and defining moments that challenged and instilled values. Core values shared
among participants include integrity, respect, loyalty, fairness, equity, learning, adaptation, and

responsibility. Probing defining moments also revealed that the participants use three distinct
paths to resolve critical incidents. In each case, the defining moments resulted in these
individuals experiencing more self-confidence, deeper commitment to core values, and the able
to find meaning and purpose in their work. Participants indicated that, as organizational leaders,
public library directors are responsible for meeting the needs o f various stakeholders, including
library personnel, governing authorities, library users, and the public. These responsibilities are
motivated by a core value o f seeking to enhance the intellectual welfare o f others.
Researching personal values is salient because these values, in essence, define who we
are, and they influence us whether or not we are consciously aware o f them. This research
contributes to the literature in organizational development by identifying techniques managerial
leaders use to reduce challenges to values (mindfulness and self-regulation) and strategies to
successfully navigate values conflicts (reflection, paths to insight, courage, and persistence).

Acknowledgements

A dissertation is a long, thoughtful process that involves many people. I am particularly
grateful to Dr. Peter Hemon for the attention, patience, and deep insights he shared so promptly
throughout the process. His guidance on the content, methods, analysis, and copyediting
involved many hours and a full career’s worth o f expertise and wisdom, which he shared so
graciously. In addition, my other committee members, Robert Dugan and Luis Herrera offered
suggestions and comments that improved the result. I am also grateful to Dr. Camila Alire, Dr.
Roger Greer, and Jennifer Andrews for their suggestions and encouragement at critical points
throughout the process. I extend special thanks to Peter Bromberg, Stevan Kalmon, and Dr. Mary
Stansbury who read and provided insightful and encouraging editorial feedback.
This research would not have been possible without the public library directors who
agreed to participant and gave such focused attention to completing the values questionnaire and
discussing their core values, defining moments, and managerial leadership practices. I am
grateful for their interest and engagement with the research topic and process, which resulted in a
rich and valuable data set. I also wish to thank those who assisted me with the development o f
the research, including my colleagues at state library agencies throughout the United States who
aided me in identifying participants. In addition, my Simmons College colleagues provided
thoughtful support and encouragement. In particular, I am grateful to Dr. Kathleen De Long,
Cynthia Landrum, and Renee Di Pilato, along with Debbi MacLeod at the Colorado State
Library, for assisting me with pre-testing the methodology and offering suggestions for
improving the data-gathering process. Amy Zimmer was a stalwart and reliable support for

interlibrary loan o f many materials, including promptly acquiring all materials and
compassionately allowing me to keep them long past due.
Along with providing direct assistance, many colleagues have supported me with
encouragement and, at times, nagging. I am grateful to my supervisor, Eugene Hainer for
understanding what it takes to write a dissertation and allowing me the flexibility to be away
from my work periodically. In addition, other colleagues at the Colorado State Library and those
in libraries throughout Colorado have been wonderful sources o f encouragement and provocative
discussion during the years o f my doctoral studies. I am grateful for their commitment to
scholarship, curiosity, and insight. In particular, I am grateful to Jeff Donlan, Michelle Drumm,
Kieran Hixon, Linda Hofschire, Jamie LaRue, Claudine Perrault, Pam Sandlian Smith, and
Nicolle Steffen.
On a personal level, I am thankful to my husband, Tim Jones, who has endured long
hours o f my writing, research, and angst. His compassion, patience, and encouragement have
been invaluable to me and my work. I am also grateful to my friends and family for their support
and understanding when I was less available than optimal for so many months.

Dedication

This work is dedicated to Dr. Roger Greer (1928 - 2014) with whom I have experienced
many moments o f meaning. His core values, stories, and vision for what is possible because o f
libraries have uniquely resonated with and inspired me. I hope this work, in some small way,
reflects aspects o f his wisdom and passion for seeking meaning, purpose, and truth.

CHAPTER ONE
SETTING UP THE STUDY

Human values are fundamental beliefs, which function as a lens through which human
beings perceive and respond to the world (Brown & Trevino, 2003; Gentile, 2010; Rokeach,
1973). They focus on preferred conduct (e.g., acting with honesty, prudence, or loyalty) or
desired end-states, such as equality, justice, and wisdom (Rokeach, 1973). With desired endstates values, attainment is aspirational as there may be no clear end point when the value goal is
met, yet a lofty value provides a sense o f purpose and meaning in an individual’s life (Rokeach,
1973). In all cases, values are inherently desirable because o f the benefits they offer the
individual, others, and/or society.
Although people share common values, each individual prioritizes a specific set o f
personal values at a given time and the most important are referred to as one’s core values
(Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz, 1996, 2011), which are an enduring set o f principles (Schwartz,
2011) that influence daily and long-term behaviors, choices, and relationships with others
(Kouzes & Posner, 2007; Posner, 2010; Russell, 2001; Schwartz, 1996). These values also guide
attitudes, judgments, and attempts to influence others (Rokeach, 1973). In addition, core values
provide insight into oneself, which informs one’s sense o f identity (Gentile, 2010). When people
operate with congruence between their core values and their actions they gain a stronger sense of
self-worth (Goldthwaite, 1996). Along with influencing conduct, these values impact
interpersonal activities, including relationship choices and career actions, such as jobs chosen
and overall career goals (Graf, van Quaquebeke, & van Dick, 2011; Russell, 2001; Schwartz,
1996). Thus, values are standards or principles which people employ to improve themselves or

life situations, and the very act o f focusing on values provides a greater sense o f self-worth,
motivation, purpose, and meaning (Gentile, 2010; Rokeach, 1973).
Values and Conflict
Because core values are internalized and vary among people, conflict among these and
other values is inevitable (King, Altman, & Lee, 2011; Rokeach, 1973). For example, in a
conflict between two people, one person may think honesty is important and bluntly state facts
which might offend the other person, who values courtesy above honesty. Another example of
interpersonal conflict occurs when a person perceives someone else as demonstrating
incongruence between values stated and actions taken, such as articulating the importance o f
loyalty yet gossiping behind another individual’s back. This perceived incongruence between
stated values and behavior can lead to loss o f respect and trust. In a third interpersonal example,
one may profess belief in a particular value, for example, self-determination, but in further
statements and behaviors demonstrate that this value is important personally but is not extended
to others. In this instance, others may perceive this person as having double standards. In each of
these examples, values conflicts get in the way o f relationship development.
Conflicts in values also occur within individuals, such as when one values prudence, yet
acts in a carefree way in certain circumstances. Conflicts also occur in a broader social setting in
which some groups hold common personal values that conflict with other sectors o f the
community. The resolution o f these various and complex dynamics o f human values conflicts is
part o f the process o f values evolution. In other words, although values are long-term beliefs,
personal values may change based on a variety o f developmental factors, relationships, and
experiences (Rokeach, 1973).

2

Values Formulation
Values start to develop at a young age and are influenced by family, teachers, and
mentors (Rokeach, 1973; Russell, 2001). For example, a child might learn the value o f honesty
from a parent and the value o f fairness from a teacher; but these experiences are accompanied by
situations in which context helps the child prioritize a set o f personal values with a few o f them
at the core. As individuals continue to experience situations related to values, each encounter
clarifies priorities and purpose.
One’s environment, including the culture in which one is raised, religious association,
and other environmental factors, plays a foundational part in the development o f personal values
(Russell, 2001). The era in which one was bom and raised also impacts personal values (Bennis
& Thomas, 2002), as does one’s vocation and life experiences (King, Altman, & Lee, 2011).
Further, the formation and reprioritization o f core values are influenced by defining moments,
also referred to as moments o f meaning (Mackoff & Wenet, 2001, p. 63), which are singular
instances in a person’s life which assume greater significance or personal meaning, and may
result in epiphany-type insights. These insights reshape or reinforce core values (Bennis &
Thomas, 2002). Thus, although values evolve, that process is not random, but rather is based on
life experiences (Schwartz, 2011).
W ork Values
Maierhofer, Rafferty, and Kabanoff (2003) distinguish between an individual’s personal
values and values in a work context. They contend that, although personal values apply broadly,
work values are determined based on work situations, including the content and context o f the
general work undertaken, the role within the organization, and specific work activities. They
maintain that the formation o f work values can be analyzed on individual, group, and

3

organizational levels. Further, these values can be explored based on the three distinct periods of
the development o f those values: acquisition, maintenance, and change. For example, when an
individual is a new employee, that person undergoes a socialization process o f being oriented to
the values o f the organization. Similarly, as a group is formed, the members may establish a set
of values that guide the work and goals o f the group. The values acquisition process at the
organizational level is parallel because o f the need to establish a few foundational values and
socialize all members to those values. In the maintenance period for individuals, groups, and
organizations, values reinforce work behavior and goals. When the individual, group, or
organization changes, new values can be introduced and they may shift priorities. On all levels
(individual, group, and organizational) values engagement during acquisition, maintenance, and
change is complex (Maierhofer et al., 2003).
Within the complex infrastructure o f values dynamics in the workplace, Dolan and Raich
(2013) state that, when managing with values, it is important to address the ambiguous business
and economic environment. They note that business management is evolving from the early 20th
century technique o f providing instructions to the late 20th century focus on objectives that
provide broader direction and strategies for employees. In the 21st century, with its rapid change
and uncertainty, they maintain that organizations would be more effective if they are managed in
adherence to three broad types o f values: (1) economic values, (2) ethical and social values, and
(3) emotional and spiritual values. Economic values (e.g., those related to good financial health,
efficiency, quality standards for performance, accountability, quality assurance, and effective
planning) are foundational to sustaining the organization. By contrast, ethical and social values
(e.g., behaving with honesty, respect, and loyalty) are oriented toward interpersonal

4

relationships. Emotional and spiritual values (e.g., optimism, passion, freedom, and creativity)
are intrinsic motivators.
Dolan and Raich (2013) posit that balancing these three types o f values leads to optimal
performance, enables systemic organizational change, and results in sustainable, innovative, and
competitive organizations at a time of an uncertain and ambiguous business and economic
environment. Carter and Greer (2013) argue that businesses are pressured not only to be
responsible to company shareholders (economic value) but also to consider the demands o f their
customers and the impacts of their operations on the environment and society more broadly. This
combination o f using values to improve organizational performance, maintain relationships, and
build sustainable, responsible practices requires values management and strategic leadership
throughout the process.
Values and Leadership
The individual who has the most influence on work values is the leader who establishes
the values o f the organization (Schein, 2010), and uses select values as a blueprint, a compass, or
a foundation for decision making, problem-solving, and conflict resolution (Kouzes & Posner,
2007). A leader’s values can be detected in attitudes, stated preferences, decisions, and
behaviors, which may be consciously or unconsciously exhibited. Because o f the importance o f a
leader’s position in determining values, this individual needs to be aware o f his or her personal
values and idealized aspirations, as well as to be mindful o f how these influence the way that
person leads others (Powley & Taylor, 2006).
When a leader clearly articulates specific values and consistently demonstrates them in
action, this person serves as a model for followers within the organization (Covey, 2004; DePree,
1989; Posner, 2010). In addition, when a leader is perceived as acting with congruence among

5

values stated, actions taken, and resulting outcomes, others think that person is authentic (King et
al., 2011; Shamir & Eilam, 2005) and responsible (Freeman & Auster, 2011). Shamir and Eilam
(2005) describe one aspect o f authentic leaders as having a strong self-concept, self-knowledge,
and clarity about their values. They base their actions on the values that have greatest meaning
for them. Freeman and Auster (2011) further posit that, when leaders act based on their values,
they live authentically through the persistent actions o f talking about their values in relation to
work and organizational aspirations.
The research on values commonly refers to the leader as the person who is in the position
to both manage and lead the organization. This dissertation refers to such individuals as
managerial leaders. Managerial leadership represents the intersection between management
activities (administering and coordinating resources to accomplish organizational goals) and
leadership actions (visioning, coaching, and inspiring others using various leadership styles)
(Hemon, 2007).
Values Congruence
Just as values congruence is important to managerial leaders as individuals, it is also
salient at an organizational level. When those in an organization share common values, there is
congruence in their decisions, goals, and actions. Managerial leaders can use values congruence
as a strategy to influence and motivate followers, as well as to gain commitment and to sustain or
increase productivity in the organization (Cha & Edmondson, 2006; Posner, 2010). The
managerial leader might reward innovative activities by promoting workers known for successful
innovation. By focusing on innovation and rewarding it in practice, the leader reinforces and
instills the value on a regular and systemic basis (Schein, 2010). Conversely, when gaps in
values congruence arise, the results among employees include suppressed motivation, hindered

6

performance, dissatisfaction, turnover, and stress (Cha & Edmondson, 2006; lilies & ReiterPalmon, 2008; Posner, 2010). Thus, a clearly defined vision and a consistent implementation o f
behavioral values results in greater productivity and positive organizational results (Carter &
Greer, 2013).
Organizational Values
In organizations, values are shared and embedded in order to make decisions, guide work
conduct, and determine goals (Schein, 2010). Values promote and sustain the organizational
vision (Larsson & Lundholm, 2010), which is focused on a desired end-state to which all
workers can aspire. This vision motivates workers by providing meaning and offering a sense o f
identity and structure for the development and solidification o f organizational norms (Strange &
Mumford, 2002). An organization’s managerial leaders articulate the meaning behind the vision,
as well as how that vision is implemented (King et al., 2011). For example, if an organization
values innovation, workers identify themselves as innovators and take more risks in developing
products or services. The organizational norms might include time each week to explore new
concepts or structures, and for workers to brainstorm regularly and across units to glean new
ideas. The organization might reward activities, such as testing new products, and view failure as
an acceptable component o f risk and innovation. In this way, the value o f innovation drives the
vision, the perceived identity o f the workers, and organizational norms. The managerial leaders,
the organizational structure, and the workers embrace innovation as a lens through which
decisions are made about priorities for work conduct. As all employees share this common value,
they support each other in using the innovation lens, which reaffirms the value across the
organization.

7

Values and Change
Even with a consistent values structure and the application o f congruent values within an
organization, managerial leaders might still shift organization values over time (Russell, 2001).
For example, a public library prior to the emergence o f the Internet might have valued the print
collections as its core asset. In the current digital environment, the organization might place a
higher value on access to collections in all formats. This shift in values’ focus is implemented in
various ways including digitizing collections, procuring more resources online than in print,
changing staff job descriptions to include teaching library users how to access online resources,
and promoting both online and print collections.
As with personal values, organizational values are enduring yet they evolve dynamically
as the environment changes. In fact, organizational change is facilitated when managerial
leaders use values to influence followers to change (Brown & Trevino, 2003; Hess & Cameron,
2006; Maierhofer et al., 2003; O ’Toole, 1996). For example, transformational leaders inspire
followers to look beyond their self-interests and toward a higher ideal that motivates and instills
commitment in the followers (Brown & Trevino, 2003). As change occurs with organizational
values and vision, the managerial leader must articulate the new values in ways that are inclusive
of followers in order to overcome resistance (O ’Toole, 1996).
Problem Statement
Values, which are fundamental beliefs that guide individuals in life and in work, provide
meaning and purpose. They can be desired end-states or preferred behaviors and in either case
are guiding principles that refer to desirable goals. The formulation o f personal values happens
over a lifetime o f experiences, including defining moments, which reinforce or fundamentally
change one’s value system. In work situations, values guide teams and the overall organization,

8

and the organization’s managerial leader has the most influence on the values and vision for
work. Values conflicts are inevitable, and efforts to be congruent with stated values and values in
practice are important at the individual, group, and organizational levels. Although values are
enduring, priorities in values change over time and, indeed, values can be used to guide
organizational change.
The literature o f library and information science (LIS) tends to portray the overall value
o f the public library in terms o f enabling “every person in the community serviced to continue
her or his education, to become more knowledgeable, and to live the life o f the mind in the way
in which she or he chooses” (Gorman, 2000, p. 29). To this end, specific library values include
stewardship, service, intellectual freedom, rationalism, literacy and learning, equity o f access to
recorded knowledge and information, privacy, and democracy (Gorman, 2000). Library
professionals prioritize some values over others when conflicts occur. In particular, library
directors who function as managerial leaders face decisions with their governing authority, their
staff, and the public, such as those related to user privacy versus security, intellectual freedom
challenges, and strains on equal access when resources are constrained. Despite the salience of
values in public library work, no study, except this one, examines the core values o f public
library directors, how their values inform their managerial leadership, how their life experiences,
including defining moments, shape those values, and how values conflicts in the library alter
their values priorities over time.
The study will be o f interest to library directors and other managerial leaders, interested
in values, how values impact work, and how these values can be leveraged to guide the
organizational vision and accomplish the organization’s mission. It may also be o f interest to
directors wanting to reflect on their own core values and how to leverage them in their everyday

9

work. Those who oversee public library directors, including library board members, may gain
ideas for assessing candidates for library director positions as well as evaluating the directors
they do hire. This study may also be of interest to library employees who rely on the director for
leadership and can gain insight on what motivates directors in the work they do. In addition,
graduate programs in LIS that include coverage o f leadership values, as well as library
professional associations and conferences with leadership institutes that address values
identification, awareness, and application, ought to find this study informative. State library staff
who work with public library directors may gain insight into how values impact public library
directors and use this knowledge to provide coaching, support, and training for library directors,
trustees, and library personnel. Because values are universal, library professionals in other
countries may also be interested in the study, and consider implications for library managerial
leadership in their own countries.
Literature Review
Life-Story Identification of Values
Shamir, Dayan-Horesh, and Adler (2005) assert that life-story research is an effective
method for studying leadership development, including the development o f values, because the
method explores leader self-concept and the extent to which values are expressed in leadership
behavior. Through life-story reflection and analysis, the researcher discovers how personal
values have formed and developed both iteratively, through repeated, cumulative family/life
lessons, and, from moments o f insight, or epiphanies, in which the individual has a new
perspective and understanding about the importance o f a particular value. Researchers have
identified several distinctions about sudden insights which have been portrayed as moments o f
meaning (M ackoff & Wenet, 2001), moments that matter (Avolio & Luthans, 2006), crucible

10

moments (Bennis & Thomas, 2002; Bennis & Thomas, 2007), and, most commonly, defining
moments. For this research, the term defining moments describes the phenomena in which critical
incidents occur and the individual is faced with moments that have special significance and long­
term effects, including redefinition o f values, identity, and life direction.
Defining Moments
Bennis and Thomas (2002, 2007) posit that defining moments are experiences in which
one’s core values are challenged and tested. These moments lead a person to face a decision
point, informed by new meaning that either strengthens existing values or replaces them with
new core values. Badaracco (1997) asserts that “defining moments compel people to arrange
their values in single file and reveal the priorities among them” (p. 75). Because defining
moments are unpredictable, and unique to each individual, they can happen frequently, or less
often, depending on the person. They can also happen in various situations, including those
within the work environment. These important moments can be significant turning points in life
or smaller insights that guide and instill values (Avolio & Luthans, 2006).
Life stories that probe defining moments identify more than just the specific core value;
they also include the context, which reveals the influences that shape the value as well as the
resulting decision to uphold that value over an extended period o f time. Thus, defining moments
reveal current values, test the individual’s dedication to particular core values, and shape values
with the result o f clarifying identity and purpose (Badaracco, 1997). Defining moments are
triggered by critical incidents; events that do not fit into the present understanding. These
conflicts force individuals to discover new meaning, novel understanding, or insight, which
either reaffirms core values or reprioritizes values in congruence with the new meaning and
understanding. A single moment can take on greater significance than other life moments, and it

not only defines values priorities but also acts as a pivot point in life that changes a person
indefinitely.
Avolio and Luthans (2006) distinguish among three types o f critical incidents that launch
defining moments: trigger moments, jolts, and challenging dilemmas. They describe trigger
moments as either negative or positive events that compel one to reflect on self and identity and
consider changes. An example might be a mentor commenting on an individual’s strength in a
way that redefines that person’s self-perception. Jolts are unanticipated crisis situations,
tragedies, or extraordinary positive circumstances that unexpectedly arise and lead the individual
to change beliefs and values. An example o f a jolt is a serious illness that reframes priorities for
what is important. Bennis and Thomas (2002, 2007) refer to these as crucible moments and state
that they lead to essential questions, such as “Who am I?,” “Who should I be?,” and “How do I
relate to others?” Challenging dilemmas can also be either self-imposed or thrust upon an
individual, and, in either case, they lead to reorientation. However, the individual may only have
limited awareness o f this reorientation when it occurs, meaning that the moment may not be
perceived as immediately significant. At times, it is only upon reflection that the individual
becomes aware o f how a moment and the subsequent values shift define a new path, a new
identity, or a new priority (Badaracco, 1997). In other cases, the challenge is apparent; it can
either be chosen by the individual or imposed, and the individual consciously reflects beyond the
current moment, sees a bigger picture, and makes a new choice (Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007).
These defining moments, according to Bennis and Thomas (2002, 2007), often are traumatic and
sobering, as well as thrilling and empowering.
M ackoff and Wenet (2001) describe defining moments as a response to a critical incident
that starts with reflection on the moment in order to discover new meaning and adopt a new

12

perspective. The second phase is to prioritize values in ways that instill a sense o f purpose that
guides decisions and behaviors. M ackoff and Wenet refer to this as developing a new habit o f
mind as the individual makes a commitment to the values and to new ways o f thinking. This
commitment to new values establishes a new direction and provides a sense o f confidence and
self-efficacy for the future (Avolio & Luthans, 2006; M ackoff & Wenet, 2001).
Because life-story studies o f defining moments are primarily conducted with recognized
leaders in business (Badaracco, 1997; Bennis & Thomas, 2002; Bennis & Thomas, 2007;
M ackoff & Wenet, 2001), education (Dahlvig & Longman 2010; Flanagan, 2002), and religious
organizations (Jolley, 2013), the circumstances o f defining moments vary. The stories o f values
formation include iterative development through family and other influential people who model
values or underscore characteristics that impact the individual’s values priorities.
Types of Defining Moments
This section illustrates various types o f defining moments identified through stories told
by subjects during life-story research. One o f the fundamental iterative ways that personal values
are established is through family. For example, one college president tells the story from her
childhood in which she went along to work with her mother who was a domestic servant. Her
mother took great pride in her duties and made it a point to show her daughter effective and
thorough methods for ironing and other domestic work. The lesson learned over time was to
value high quality work and to get the details right, which the college president could use
regardless o f her position (M ackoff & Wenet, 2001). In the same study o f business and public
sector leaders, others told stories o f learning what not to do from a parent (M ackoff & Wenet,
2001). More than one subject mentioned an authoritarian parent who helped the person decide
not to be an authoritarian leader, and, instead, focus on being inclusive o f others when making

13

leadership decisions. The narratives o f family often include specific incidents followed by the
moral o f the story as filtered through the narrator or subject. In turn, the learning experience
takes on significant meaning and becomes a value that is instilled in the storyteller.
Along with family, mentors, teachers, and others can provide modeling or influential
experiences that lead a person to adopt particular values. In fact, it is common in these narratives
to find an authoritative figure who makes a comment that shifts the individual’s perception of
self (Dahlvig & Longman 2010; Mackoff & Wenet, 2001). For example, Dahlvig and Longman
(2010) interviewed 16 women identified as emerging leaders in Christian higher education about
defining moments related to their leadership development. They used a leadership timeline to aid
in the identification o f defining moments in which values were clarified. Several women spoke
o f a person o f authority or influence who pointed out to them that they had leadership potential,
which reframed their own self-perceptions. In other instances, a respected person reframed the
individual’s understanding o f leadership in ways that helped her see herself as a leader.
As with other stories o f values formation, the narrator, or subject, decides what meaning
to extrapolate from encounters or situations. For example, when a teacher makes a disparaging
comment, asserting that a student will never amount to anything, one student might interpret that
as a fact, begin to redefine his or her image, and assume a negative identity. In M ackoff and
W enet’s (2001) leadership interviews, one chief executive officer (CEO) is described as
becoming spiteful and deciding to succeed at any price in order to prove such a teacher wrong;
another CEO interpreted a similar comment by a teacher as a challenge to succeed regardless of
an authority figure’s opinion. M ackoff and Wenet (2001) refer to this interpretation o f an
experience as framing, and, through analysis o f the leader interviews, they found that a common
element o f subjects’ life-stories was reframing negative encounters and circumstances in positive

14

ways. The subjects then use this interpretation to define how to make sense o f the situation and
determine which values get prioritized for the future.
Another type of story relates to an event in which a person stands up for a strongly held
value. The circumstance emerges because the individual experiences internal conflict and
becomes uncomfortable with the way a situation is evolving. Upon reflection, the individual
realizes that some aspect o f the circumstance does not align with his or her core values and the
conflict is strong enough that he or she speaks up or takes action (Dahlvig & Longman, 2010).
Because values are often subconsciously held beliefs, at times it is not until a strong value is
challenged that the individual becomes aware o f the importance o f the value. Instances in which
one stands up for a belief, or finds the courage to say no to a circumstance that conflicts with a
core value, clarify the specific value. The value may have been a core component o f a person’s
belief system, but it was not until the value was challenged that the person became consciously
aware o f it.
One commonly described situation involves a subject who is faced with two “right”
choices, and when the decision is made, it reveals the individual’s priority among values
(Badaracco, 1997). Badaracco (1997) describes a young analyst who was asked to join a sales
team temporarily because he was African American. The analyst was told that the client would
look favorably on the bid knowing that he was on the team. On one hand, the analyst wanted to
do his part as a team player and help the company succeed, but, on the other hand, he had been
raised to believe that it was his performance, not his skin color, that should guide his
opportunities. In the end, he went on the team sales trip, thereby establishing the values priorities
o f company success and being a team player over the value o f standing up for the view that skin
color should not be a factor in business decisions.

15

Another salient type of values story involves a particular life circumstance that creates a
new way o f thinking or, as M ackoff and Wenet (2001) describe it, a transformation o f “a
knowing moment into a guiding metaphor” (p. 73). One such example involves a boy who broke
his back, and, although the medical professionals told his parents he would never walk again,
nobody told him. One day after lying uncomfortably in bed for days, he decided to get up and go
to the bathroom, which he did. Upon seeing the shock o f others, and his father crying for the
only time in his life, the boy realized that it is not necessarily what one does not know that holds
one back, but sometimes it is what one does know that can be a barrier to success (Janson, 2008).
This story illustrates a moment in the subject’s life when, through this challenge and the resulting
insight, he discovered an extended metaphor which taught him the value o f persistence.
Janson (2008), who interviewed senior leaders at a New Zealand leadership institute,
reported that the majority o f their Leadership Formative Experiences (LFE) occurred in
adulthood, with more moments of development based on intentional strategies for selfimprovement rather than situations o f coping with struggle. Bennis and Thomas (2007)
investigated moments o f struggle to identify defining moments that lead to development of core
values and leadership abilities.
In considering how values are formed through adversity, some studies identified what
they termed crucible experiences (e.g., Bennis & Thomas, 2007), which are challenging, often
traumatic situations, that are either self-imposed or externally thrust upon an individual. Bennis
and Thomas (2007) identified business leaders o f two generations (bom 1908-1935; 1966-1979),
and asked them about crucible moments which they described as an event or relationship in a
person’s life that either reinforced or helped reprioritize core values. These events required the
individual to reflect, find new meaning in life, and use that meaning to adapt and change. To

16

identify these crucible moments, each participant drew a line on a piece o f paper that began with
birth and ended at a point 10 years into the future, and placed “X” marks on points in the life line
in which they thought major turning points occurred. These marks then provoked a conversation
about the challenges the person faced in ways that revealed shifts in values priorities.
Impacts of Values Formation
Life-story research allows researchers to not only identify the personal values of
individuals, but also gain an understanding o f the context in which the situation occurs. The
depth o f probing also seeks to understand the meaning and the long-term impact o f rich
experiences on values development. In many o f the studies, the long-term impact relates to how
organizational leaders conduct themselves. Bennis and Thomas (2007) contend that what
distinguishes effective organizational leaders from others is their response to defining moments.
They found that study participants responded to incidents adaptively, focused on reframing
potentially negative situations as learning opportunities, and engaged others to build shared
meaning. M ackoff and Wenet (2001) also concluded that the most effective organizational
leaders reframed experiences o f adversity as beneficial paths and that defining moments made
leaders more interested in engaging and learning from followers and others.
Flanagan (2002) studied eight women in higher education administration and their
defining moments, early leadership lessons, the values they employ as leaders, and their specific
experience and application o f values. She concluded that administrators perceived the definition
and application o f values as a major factor in their leadership success. One finding was that
values influenced their leadership style, including the choices they made, their focus on
continuous learning, and leadership growth, as well as their commitment to mentoring and
encouraging others who sought values-based leadership development. Leveraging their values

17

also gave some o f them the courage to say no to others as well as the confidence to leave
organizations that did not support their values and goals. The reflection on previous life
experiences helped to identify values priorities that led to leadership strategies o f inclusion
(involvement, encouragement, support, and sensitivity); fairness (integrity and compassion); and
respect (empathy and kindness). Flanagan concluded that clarifying values is salient in
leadership, especially when the individual has a systematic understanding o f how these values
impact leadership choices. She also pointed out that, when leaders undergo an active process of
connecting with their values through remembering, reflecting, analyzing, and learning, they are
more capable of taking action on those values. Dahlvig and Longman (2010) added that, by
reflecting on defining moments and leadership, the subjects of their study were more confident
about their leadership potential.
Jolley (2013) conducted a narrative study o f 11 male senior pastors o f mega churches in
the United States to examine the influence o f crucible moments on their leadership. She
concluded that these church leaders responded to the crucible moments by becoming more selfaware, being more receptive to assistance, reconstructing their perceptions o f crucible moments
as learning experiences, and choosing to be transparent about these experiences in order to
articulate the lessons and model their preferred values for their followers. Further, by
overcoming the crucible experiences, the participants had a stronger sense o f purpose related to
their role in the church.
The underlying theme in much o f life-stories research is that values clarification, both in
the moment and when the subjects reflect on their defining moments, provides them with a
stronger sense o f purpose. Through self-reflection subjects gain a learning orientation, and values
often provide them with courage and a sense o f conviction to stand up for what they believe in.

18

This conviction then instills confidence, which allows the individual to explore more broadly, be
open to ambiguity (Bennis & Thomas, 2007), and take risks (M ackoff & Wenet, 2001). Bennis
and Thomas (2007) assert that overcoming a significant challenge builds more adaptive capacity
and resilience when future challenges arise. Many o f the subjects in these studies also have
stronger relational capacity after experiencing challenges, including the ability to mentor others
successfully and to learn from followers in a symbiotic way.
Leading with Values
M ackoff and Wenet (2001) studied how national leaders develop a strong value system
and find purpose in their work. They concluded that leadership consists o f five specific thought
patterns that leaders may employ: (1) reflecting, including self-examination; (2) reframing
negative events with resilience; (3) attuning to and learning from followers; (4) possessing the
conviction to trust their value and speak from their experience; and (5) replenishing themselves
to restore perspective and renew resources.
Bennis and Thomas (2007) posit that adaptation to crucible experiences determines,
among other things, one’s competence as a leader. In other words, the meaning that leaders make
o f crucible experiences and their new or affirmed values-orientation leads to articulation of
meaning and a vision in ways that others seek to follow. This capacity to adapt, Bennis and
Thomas (2007) conclude, manifests as creative problem-solving, flexibility in the face o f
challenges, increased hardiness, the ability to endure and sustain oneself to overcome adversity,
and the navigation o f timing and circumstances to seize opportunities proactively. After a
crucible moment, organizational leaders can engage followers by articulating values and
conveying meaning in ways that followers can understand and adopt. In addition, these leaders
may empathize and encourage dissenting opinion from followers in order to establish dialogue

19

and generate shared meaning and values priorities. This process requires leaders to have a sense
o f purpose, self-awareness, and self-confidence, as well as emotional intelligence in order to both
demonstrate the way and exhibit strong characteristics that followers find compelling in a leader.
Leader also need to exhibit integrity, which Bennis and Thomas (2007) describe as a balance
between ambitious goals and competence in reaching those goals, as well as a moral compass to
ensure the goals are morally desirable.
Along with using stories to determine values formation, leaders may also employ stories
to convey values to followers for the purpose o f influence and change. One method is through
articulating formative life stories and the values and principles they have engendered (Gentile,
2010), while another method is to demonstrate congruence among these stories, values, and
principles, and the actions o f the leader, so that a leader is perceived as having integrity and is a
role model for followers (Avolio & Luthans, 2006; Bennis & Thomas, 2007).
In reviewing how leaders employ stories to articulate values in work, Gentile (2010)
interviewed leaders about times when their expressed values conflicted in the organization. She
examined what they did, what motivated them to speak up, what they would have liked to do,
and what would have made it easier for them to speak up. Through this investigation, Gentile
concluded that articulating values at work requires incremental introduction o f a well framed,
compelling story that is well told to the appropriate audience(s) over time. A well framed story
needs to include facts and framing or reframing o f an issue in a way that influences the audience.
The audience is chosen carefully with the initial values-story told first to perceived allies who
might help to refine the story, provide strategy, or help develop a coalition. At times, asking
questions rather than making statements is a method to gain clarity and build buy-in while also
understanding the needs and concerns o f the audience.

20

Bennis and Thomas (2007) state that essential to leadership is the ability to develop a
compelling vision and to gain followers acceptance. The vision is developed with the leader’s
own values, as well as in engagement with others, to establish shared meaning and build a
common purpose (Avolio & Luthans, 2006).
Challenges to Values-based Leadership
At times, defining moments occur when organizational leaders face situations which
Badaracco (1997) refers to as right versus right, circumstances in which there is no wrong
option, but a clear need to choose among two competing and viable options. These work-related
defining moments can include conflicts between personal values and organizational or
professional values or between personal values and the values o f supervisors or team members.
Badaracco (1997) posits that, in such instances, these conflicts test the strength o f leaders’
commitment to their own values as they take into account the influence from their organization’s
values, power dynamics, and social pressures. These defining moments require the
organizational leader to adapt, interpret, and customize basic values to meet the broader
organizational context, and they may function over time as links in a chain that establish a
leadership direction with new values priorities. In this way, values that are redefined lead to
future situations in which those values then take priority in decision making and activities
undertaken.
In considering how leaders use their values in organizations, research also points to
situations in which values are not always leveraged. Quinn (2005) asserts that, although leaders
do their best work when they draw on their fundamental values and capacities, this is not the
“normal” state o f leadership practice, but rather a “fundamental state o f leadership” (p. 76). In
situations o f crisis or disruption, leaders focus on results and deploy internally-directed values

21

and confidence. However, this level o f leadership, termed the excellence framework, is often a
temporary state because the methods are demanding and can lead to leadership burn-out (Quinn,
2005). The more common situation, according to Quinn (2005), is when organizational leaders
operate from a competence framework, rather than an excellence framework, by assuming that
the organization is functioning well enough that simply maintaining the status quo is sufficient.
Other components o f the competence framework are compliance with others, focus on personal
comfort and rewards, and risk avoidance. Quinn notes that organizational leaders can shift to a
focus on excellence through attention to the moments in their everyday work when they can
strive for organizational greatness. This shift requires daily focus on results, an internallydirected compass based on values and integrity, an orientation toward supporting followers, and
attention to external signals and stimuli that point to the need for adaptive change. In this way,
defining moments may occur on a daily basis and may be the impetus for an organizational
leader to be self-aware, to self-regulate, and to leverage these moments and values to make
meaningful decisions (Avolio & Luthans, 2006; Badaracco, 1997).
Public Sector Managerial Leadership and Values
The previously mentioned studies were primarily conducted in the private sector; the
public and not-for-profit sectors have been studied less. Orazi, Turrini, and Valott (2013)
conducted a literature review o f public sector leadership studies, specifically those in national,
state, and city agencies. They found that, although public sector leaders share some o f the same
goals as private sector leaders (e.g., interest in goal achievement and follower development),
they have distinctly different motivations. For example, public sector leaders value work that
benefits others and society, thus choosing to work in an arena in which they can influence public
policy. In exchange, they are willing to accept smaller salaries, fewer benefits and other perks

22

available in the private sector because they are motivated by achievement rather than power or
wealth. In addition, public sector leaders recognize the importance o f preserving integrity
because they are not only accountable to the governing authority but also to the public. Orazi,
Turrini, and Valott (2013) point out that legal requirements and ubiquitous technology require
public sector leaders to be more transparent (e.g., make documentation and reports publicly
available). They concluded that public sector leaders need to balance transactional leadership
(monitoring, measuring to standards, and corrective action) and transformational leadership
(articulating a compelling vision which offers meaning and a sense o f purpose, while developing
staff, providing challenging and rewarding work to aspiring employees, and modeling pro-social
values and behavior). Because public library directors are public sector leaders, this additional
context about this form of leadership is relevant to a study o f core values and defining moments
o f public library directors.
Core Values Identification
Along with identifying values based on life experience, researchers have developed
instruments to ascertain individual values priorities. One o f the first instruments developed to
measure personal values is the Study o f Values (SOV), which is based on six ideal value types:
(1) theoretical (discovery o f truth and cognitive); (2) economic (what is most useful and selfpreservation); (3) aesthetic (form, beauty, and harmony); (4) social (love and altruism); (5)
political (power, influence, and renown); and (6) religious (unity) (Allport, Vernon, & Lindzay,
1970). The SOV, used in psychology and social science research, was updated by Kopelman,
Rovenpor, and Guan (2003). The instrument consists o f 120 questions, 20 for each value, divided
in two parts: (1) situational questions, which require the participants to rank two different ways
o f responding, and (2) situational questions, with four values but only one may be selected.

23

Rokeach (1973), who developed non-comprehensive lists o f 18 desired end-states
(terminal) values and 18 behavioral (instrumental) values, asked study participants to prioritize
each list by ranking the values from 1 to 18. This method requires them to consider and weigh
each value against the others to determine their own unique prioritized list o f values. Rokeach
then asked questions related to how participants would respond to situations in order to
determine how the values prioritized related to each subject’s behavior. Through this process, he
concluded that prioritized values predict attitudes and/or behaviors. For example, those who
prioritize equality also report that they are more likely to engage in interracial relationships.
Those who prioritize salvation state that they are more likely to go to church regularly as well as
to prioritize a specific religion; and those who indicate intellectual values, including imagination
and logical thinking, are more likely to hold positions as college professors. In the later part o f
the 20th century many researchers used Rokeach’s instrument, often as a supplement to other
research tools. Because at times it is difficult to distinguish an instrumental from a terminal
value, a context is often provided to extract those values (Meglino & Ravlin, 1998).
In 1987, Schwartz and Bilsky asserted that 10 basic universal personal values underlie the
motives o f individuals regardless o f culture. These personal values, they theorized, stem from
three fundamental human motivations: meeting biological needs, engaging in social interaction,
and being part o f a group for survival and functioning. Each o f the values has a defining goal
with distinct motivation. Within each o f the 10 universal values are more specific values that
represent aspects o f the overall motivational value. In addition, some single values are associated
with more than one larger universal value (Schwartz, 2012) (see Table 1.1).

Universalism

Schwartz (2012) constructed two instruments to measure personal values: the Schwartz
Values Survey (SVS) and the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ). The SVS has two sections in
25

which the subjects rate each value. The first is a list o f 30 nouns that describe distinct desired
end-states; while the second list consists o f 26 adjectives which describe desired ways o f
behaving. Each item describes an aspect o f the larger motivational goal; for example, equality is
listed with a brief description of “equal opportunity for all,” which is associated with the broader
motivational value o f universalism. Subjects rate each item on a nine-point scale ranging from
extreme importance in personal life (7) to opposed to personal values (-1). The rating allows
them to identify values that are important to them and those to which they are distinctly opposed.
This design aids in measuring values across cultures to determine which are universal (Schwartz,
2012).

Schwartz (1996, 2012) also constructed the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) to
identify and rate values. This instrument, now in its fourth version, measures values indirectly by
offering a list o f 40 brief portraits of individuals in order to elicit responses that imply a shared
value. For example, “Thinking up new ideas and being creative is important to him. He likes to
do things in his own original way.” describes a person for whom self-direction values are
important. The respondent determines the extent to which the person described in the portrait is
like him self or herself by selecting from a scale o f six choices: “not like me at all,” “not like me,
a little like me,” “somewhat like me,” “like me,” and “very much like me.”
With the SVS and the PVQ, Schwartz (1996, 2003) and Schwartz, Melech, Lehmann,
Burgess, Harris, and Owens (2001), and others have tested the 10 values theory in 82 countries
(Schwartz, 2012) to refine and clarify that these are the universal human values. Schwartz also
posits that the motivational values relate to each other on a continuum in which some values
share common interests; examples include power and achievement motivated by self­
enhancement, and benevolence and universalism associated with self-transcendence and societal

26

enhancement. In addition, stimulation and self-direction are associated with broader tendencies:
openness to change whereas security, conformity, and tradition align with conservation and
maintenance o f current infrastructure. Schwartz illustrates the relationship o f each value to the
others and depicts, in positions across from one another, those that have potentially opposing
motivations (see Figure 1.1).

Research on Values of Librarians and the Library Profession
Early research in the United States on the personal values o f librarians was conducted as
part o f larger studies on the personality o f librarians. In 1947, Bryan (1952) surveyed 3,107
public librarians and described their interests, motivations, attitudes, and characteristics. Using
the SOV, she found that librarians emphasized artistic, literacy, and musical values rather than

27

scientific and sociological values. In a dissertation on the personality o f the librarian, Douglass
(1957), who used a truncated version o f the SOV to evaluate 525 library school students, in 17
LIS schools in the United States, found that students overemphasized theoretical and aesthetic
values, and underemphasized economic and political values. Religious and social values were
not studied.
Igwe (1981) also used the SOV to survey students in Nigeria and the United States to
identify and compare personal values across countries and by gender. He found that the majority
o f American students (both male and female) prioritized theoretical, aesthetic, and social values,
and de-emphasized economic, political, and religious values. The Nigerian male students
emphasized economic, theoretical, and social values, and the Nigerian female students
emphasized economic, social, and religious values. One o f his conclusions was that a lack o f
emphasis placed on economic and political values by U.S. students could lead to challenges to
the financial health o f libraries when librarians needed to compete for limited resources. It is
conceivable that some o f the subjects, as they entered the library workforce and management
positions, changed to emphasize economic and political values; however, no follow-up or
longitudinal study was conducted to determine change in values priorities over time.
Yerkey (1980) conducted a values study o f North American library school students and
faculty, as well as librarians, using the Rokeach terminal values survey. The list o f terminal
values includes a comfortable life, an exciting life, a sense o f accomplishment, a world at peace,
a world o f beauty, equality, family security, freedom, happiness, inner harmony, mature love,
national security, pleasure, salvation, self-respect, social recognition, true friendship, and
wisdom. The subjects were asked to rank this values list from one (highest priority) to 18 (lowest
priority). The results indicated that, in general, library school students and professionals

28

emphasized self-respect and freedom, and placed the lowest priority on comfort, pleasure, and
security.
Studies have also examined the prioritized values o f the library profession. Dole, Hurych,
and Koehler (2000) conducted two multi-national studies in which library professionals selected
the top three professional values from a list o f 11. Although there were some differentiations in
ranking based on type o f library position (e.g., school librarians prioritized literacy, and those in
underprivileged socioeconomic areas prioritized access for all), the top value in each study was
service to the user, followed by the values o f intellectual freedom, preservation o f the public
record, equity o f access, and, to a lesser degree, information literacy.
Foster and McMenemy (2012) compared the language o f codes o f ethics from
professional librarians’ associations in 36 countries using Gorman’s Enduring Values list. Using
content analysis o f the codes o f ethics, they concluded that a majority included five o f Gorman’s
values; service, privacy, and equity o f access were common, and stewardship and intellectual
freedom were often present, but less emphasized than the first three.
Researchers also have investigated the work values o f librarians within organizations,
specifically personal values o f academic librarians as they relate to work satisfaction (Burd,
2003). Hovenkamp (1994), who compared the work values o f professionals in unionized and
non-unionized academic libraries using job attribute values preferences, found little difference
among librarians in these two types o f libraries. Burd (2003), who measured four types o f work
values (relationship-oriented, goal- and change-oriented, professional career-oriented, and
competence/achievement-oriented), found that, regardless o f which o f these was most
prioritized, the primary value of service was always prominent. Librarians, Burd noted, were
more satisfied and less likely to leave if they perceived the organization as supportive of

29

participatory management, open with communication, offering opportunities for achievement,
and having relationships built on honesty and trust.
Public Library Director Attributes
Because this dissertation research examines core values o f public library directors within
the work context, a review o f the literature on public library director attributes and competencies
is relevant. Using the Delphi technique to determine a prioritized list o f attributes (traits, skills,
and knowledge required for future library leadership), Hemon, Powell, and Young (2003)
studied academic and public library directors. For public library directors, the list o f attributes is
divided into three areas: managerial attributes, personal attributes, and areas o f knowledge.
Among managerial-related attributes, the highest ranking were the ability to work effectively
with library boards as well as library staff; the ability to advocate for the library, including the
ability to communicate the vital role o f the library in the community; the ability to solve
problems effectively as well as work with community and civic organizations; and the ability to
communicate effectively with staff. Among personal attributes the highest ranking were
demonstrating integrity, having a vision, communicating effectively, and having strong
interpersonal skills. The highest ranking attributes related to knowledge included an
understanding o f trends o f innovation in libraries and of current library practices; the ability to
perform long-range planning, budgeting, and financial planning; and a grasp o f both intellectual
freedom and the laws and policies that govern public library operations.
Jordan (2012) used the Delphi technique to determine a prioritized list o f competencies,
which are defined as knowledge, skills, and attributes that underlie effective work for public
library directors. The assumption is that these directors exercise these competencies on a daily
basis in order to ensure effective library operations. She provided the subjects with a list of

30

possible competencies, which was based on previous research. Over successive rankings, the
participants could suggest other competencies, which were incorporated into subsequent lists to
be ranked by all participants. Through these multiple rankings o f the competencies list, the
resulting highest ranking competencies were integrity, which was defined as being honest,
following the professional code o f ethics, being a role model for others, and customer service,
which incorporates both internal and external service and the concept that the library user is
central to the library’s work. Along with these competencies, credibility, accountability, effective
communication skills, and vision were ranked high; followed by demonstrating leadership by
taking charge o f situations and resolving them successfully, as well as political understanding of
government relationships and organizational structure. Skills in interpersonal communications
and advocacy were also highly ranked on the list.
These two studies, conducted nine years apart using separate lists and subjects, have
complementary and overlapping areas o f lists and subjects that suggest important public library
director activities. In both cases, integrity was identified as a high priority as was the ability to
develop and articulate a strong vision.
Summary
Research on public library directors identifies competencies and attributes, including
integrity (Hemon et al., 2003; Jordan, 2012). Additional studies have used values instruments to
determine personal values o f librarians (Douglass, 1957; Igwe, 1981; Yerkey, 1980), though
none have used the PVQ, which has been used in 82 countries and in other professions. Along
with identifying values using instruments, life-story research provides rich detail about values
formation and change over time, particularly through reflection on defining moments (Shamir et
al., 2005). Defining moments include five characteristics:

31

1. They are meaningful life experiences in which one’s core values are challenged and
tested, resulting in a clearer understanding o f one’s values priorities (Bennis &
Thomas, 2007).
2. They can be significant turning points or smaller insights that guide and instill values
(Avolio & Luthans, 2006) and clarify meaning and purpose (Gentile, 2010).
3. Critical incidents, which trigger defining moments, are either self-imposed or
externally prompted events, either positive or negative, that compel a person to stop
and rethink his or her current values and perspective (Avolio & Luthans, 2006).
4. The stages o f a defining moment are the (a) experience o f critical incident (or event),
(b) reflection on the conflict with current values priorities, (c) discovery o f new
meaning (also termed insight or epiphany), (d) decision to commit to new values
priorities and direction, (e) new sense o f identity, and, in the case o f positive
responses, a stronger sense o f purpose, self-confidence, and self-efficacy (Avolio &
Luthans, 2006; M ackoff & Wenet, 2001).
5. When one responds to a critical incident by framing the meaning in a positive,
constructivist way, the defining moment leads to a beneficial path which, in turn,
results in more engagement and growth. Successful leaders tend to face critical
incidents with positive reframing, and the resulting defining moments lead to greater
adaptability to change (Bennis & Thomas, 2007).

Procedures
This dissertation uses a quantitative method to identify core values and a qualitative one,
under the umbrella o f a phenomenological approach (the study o f life phenomena as they are
perceived by the subjects of the study),1 to investigate core values use and formation. Hatch
(2002) points out the importance o f researchers articulating the fundamental philosophical
framework, which underlies their thinking. First, from an ontological perspective, rather than
having one agreed on reality, this research presumes that library directors may construct multiple
realities. From an epistemological perspective, this research perceives knowledge as a human
construction, which can be understood with the collaborative effort o f the researcher and
participants.
Phenomenological research is distinguished from other qualitative methods by the focus
on a concept or phenomenon in order to seek to understand the meaning. Data to be analyzed
may include critical incidents as framed by the participants to reveal the essence o f the
phenomena. In this study, the phenomena are the core values and defining moments o f public
library directors, and the phenomenological method is appropriate because the participants
provide first-hand accounts o f their values, how these values were formed, and how these values

1 Creswell (1998) and Moustakas (1994) describe the phenom enological approach.

34

are used and, potentially, changed by their work as library directors. The analysis seeks to reveal
the meaning o f critical incidents related to their values in the public library environment.
Seidman (2013) points out that many terms are used to discuss the subjects o f qualitative
studies, such as interviewees, respondents, subjects, informants, or co-researchers. He concludes
the term “participants” is most appropriate because they reconstruct their experience actively
within the context o f the study and therefore are involved in the investigative process. For this
reason, this dissertation uses the term participant to refer to study subjects.
While quantitative research employs deductive reasoning, qualitative research requires
inductive reasoning because the details are collected and considered individually, then in larger
groupings, and, finally, in a broader context to develop the conclusions. Inductive analysis can
develop a comprehensive, holistic, expansive, and richly descriptive set o f findings, and the
researcher’s role is to discover what occurs, what those occurrences imply, and the relationships
linking those occurrences (Merriam, 1998).
This research strategy requires the investigator to have direct engagement with the
participants o f the study, thus requiring this person to reflexivity (Hatch, 2002). Reflexivity is the
ability o f the investigator to focus consciously on neutrality by remaining alert to influences in
the setting that may trigger personal bias, by diligently bracketing those perspectives, and by
monitoring one’s emotions and remaining detached.
Research Design
With regard to the study population, Seidman (2013) suggests variation among
participants in qualitative research in order that the results, though not generalizable, will be
relatable to a broad audience. For example, if the study were limited to directors o f the largest
libraries in the country the findings may only be relatable to those directors that oversee libraries

35

o f that type. Similarly, if the study were conducted within one state or a small geographic region,
it narrows the population that can relate to the results. For this reason, a broad pool o f library
sizes and settings, in a wide geographic area, was identified for the study.
Patton (2002) articulates the importance o f determining purposeful, non-probability
sampling for qualitative research in order to acquire rich information and illuminate data that
lead to insight about the phenomenon. Although there is no comprehensive and objective tool for
identifying public library directors as outstanding, it is possible to compare public library output
metrics to determine which libraries have the highest use. Those libraries are recognized each
year with the star library designation, which comprised the first criteria to narrow the selection
o f libraries for this study. Specifically, libraries were selected for a three-year period (20082010), a timeframe indicating that the library directors have consistently employed strong
managerial leadership over time in order to maintain the high library use by the public.
Specifically, the timeframe includes the period o f the Great Recession and the years just after the
economic downturn in which public libraries throughout the country faced multiple years of
budget cuts as well as pressures to reinvent services and modernize as they face 21st century
demands (Lyons & Lance, 2012). This climate, in some cases, may have generated critical
incidents for public library directors that challenged them to use values-driven decisions to
maintain and improve library performances.
Lyons and Lance (2012) identify over 100 public libraries that ranked in the top category
for their size within those three years. For further reduction to a manageable study size, the
investigator reviewed the websites o f the libraries for statements o f vision and mission, strategic

2 L ibrary Journal publishes an annual index, which compares U.S. public libraries in four per capita output areas
(circulation, visits, program attendance, and computer use) among nine distinct library sizes, which range from
expenditures o f $30 million or more (largest system s) to those libraries with the expenditure range o f $10,000 49,000 annually (smallest libraries). The top performing libraries in each expenditure category are labeled Star
L ibraries (Lyons & Lance, 2012).

36

plans, and other organizational documentation. Through this content analysis, the investigator
sought evidence o f public library director attributes and competencies as outlined by Hemon,
Powell, and Young (2003) and Jordan (2012). When available, board minutes were reviewed to
determine that the library director had been working at the library for the timeframe indicated.
For other verification o f employment dates, the investigator used Linkedln to research library
directors’ employment histories.
To further identify those directors who exhibited strong managerial leadership qualities,
the investigator consulted with state-level library administrators (state librarians and
development directors) to confirm that the library directors demonstrated the abilities to
articulate a compelling vision and influence others to follow (Northouse, 2013), as well as to
connect to the community, engage in the library profession, and work effectively with their
boards and staff. When state library staff did not know the directors, indicated that the director
had not been at the library for the timeframe, or did not confirm that the directors met the criteria
above, those directors were removed from the potential participant list. In those cases in which
state library staff did not respond, the libraries and their directors were eliminated, thus further
reducing the list and number o f states. Collectively, these criteria narrowed the list to 15 public
library directors residing in 11 states, including the Northeast, Midwest, and western United
States.
The study participants are directors o f public libraries with budgets ranging from more
than $30 million to less than $50,000, and serve varied communities including rural, suburban,
and urban populations. No distinction was made to select based on the directors’ educational
attainment because, though the master’s degree in library and information science (MLIS) is
designed to create a “unifying identity with shared values and knowledge/skills” for the

37

profession (Simpson, 2011, p. 12), many public library directors, particularly in libraries serving
populations o f 25,000 or less, do not hold these degrees (Simpson, 2011). In this study most, but
not all, have earned the MLIS. The library directors include a proportionally high number of
women; however, the library profession is predominantly female, which accounts for the larger
percentage o f women.
Methodology
This study used two methods to investigate the research questions: a values
questionnaire and a personal interview via telephone. All directors initially were sent an e-mail
message (Appendix A), in December 2013, to make them aware o f the study and encourage
participation. Rubin and Rubin (2012) suggest that having someone with a social or professional
connection vouch for the researcher by way o f introduction helps gain trust and participation
from potential participants. To this end, the investigator contacted state library colleagues and
asked if they would be willing to contact the specific potential candidate(s) in their state to make
them aware for the study. (Appendix B provides a copy o f the e-mail content to the colleague
liaisons.)
Many o f the participants responded promptly, but in a few cases, the investigator called
to inform the directors about the study, as well as to answer questions, to point them to the online
values instrument, to schedule the interviews, and to begin to establish rapport. Seidman (2013)
asserts that, when recruiting participants, telling them about the study rather than simply asking
if they would like to be in the study, makes it more likely they will participant. To this end, a
script was developed (see Appendix C) for the telephone call.
After the initial e-mail and telephone calls establishing participation, the investigator sent
each participant (via e-mail and U.S. mail depending on the stated preference) the specific

38

instruments, including access to the values questionnaire, interview questions, and definitions of
study terms as well as the informed consent form (see Appendix D). As recommended by
Creswell (1998), and required by the Simmons Institutional Review Board (IRB), the
participants were informed o f the central purpose o f the study, the procedures for gathering data,
and their rights and responsibilities. They signed consent forms prior to starting the study.
Moustakas (1994) and Hatch (2002) point out that, when conducting phenomenological studies
that involve participants’ stories, and other personal information, the investigator has an
obligation to provide clear information about how the stories will be used.3 The investigator
informed the participants about how their material would be utilized in written communication
and again via telephone prior to the narrative inquiry interview.
PVQ
In order to identify core values, each participant completed the Portrait Values
Questionnaire IV (PVQIV) (S. H. Schwartz, personal correspondence, January 18, 2012)
(Appendix E) either in print or online. The instrument and its predecessors have been used in
values studies as diverse as those examining values congruence between employees and
managers (G raf et al., 2011); values change in retired adults (Burr, 2009); and human values
structure and function (Hoffman, 2009). The investigator obtained the PVQIV instrument as well
as the coding instructions from Schwartz (personal correspondence, January 18, 2 0 12).4 This
instrument is designed for participants to compare only one distinct value o f a character at a time
with their own tendency in order to obtain a valid identification with one specific motivational
value (Schwartz, 2003; Schwartz et al., 2001). The answers for degrees o f “likeness” to another

3 In the case o f this study, the stories w ill be used for the dissertation and som e or all o f particular stories may also
be used for follow-up presentations or future publication. Prior to any written publication, the participant will be
contacted to confirm the use o f the story and the continued confidentiality associated with it.
4 The investigator used the PVQIV in a previous, unpublished, pilot study and found the public library directors
were able to relate to the results and use this as a starting point for discussing their values in their work.

person described in each o f the 40 portraits are ranked on a six-point scale with a numeric value
assigned to each for analysis. Because some respondents have a tendency to rate themselves
higher in many categories, while others may have a response tendency to rank either in the
middle for many questions, or low on most, Schwartz (2003) recommends a respondent’s mean
scores for each motivational value be calculated and then compared to the respondent’s total
mean for all the values (S. H. Schwartz, personal correspondence, January 18, 2012). This
allows the investigator to compare mean scores across all participants regardless o f the specific
response tendency o f each participant.
The investigator created a values report for each participant (Appendix F), customized by
listing the 10 motivational values in order o f highest to lowest respondent priority, as well as a
pie chart with the respondent’s numeric result for each broader value.5 Upon receipt o f the
report, the participants were asked to reflect on the values chart and list as well as on interview
questions related to defining moments, critical events, and values in their work.
Personal Interviews
The next method for collecting data was the interview (see Appendix G), which centered
on narrative inquiry, a qualitative research method designed to probe critical events in human
lives (Anfara & Mertz, 2006; Klenke, 2008; Webster & Mertova, 2007). Narrative inquiry
requires detailed descriptions of the scene, plot, characters, and circumstances in order to
develop a vivid portrait o f the event. This method allows the investigator to explore complex
human-centered issues, such as core values by honing in on critical events, as defined and
described by the participants. During the inquiry process the investigator asks probing questions

5 See Appendix F for a sample o f this report and preparatory instructions for the interview, which were sent to each
participant prior to the interviews.

40

to elicit in-depth descriptions from the participants in order for them to find meaning and
purpose which may not have been apparent at the time o f the event.
Because narrative inquiry is event-driven, it was used to glean details o f professional
activities related to core values in two critical events identified by each participant. The
investigator began the interviews by asking participants’ to describe two critical events and then
shifted the conversation to formation and evolution o f their core values, including any changes
over time, role models who influenced values, and other shifts in values priorities. In addition,
the participants discussed how they define leadership and if and how values relate to their role as
a public library director. The interview, including narrative inquiry and additional questions
related to values and leadership, was scheduled for up to 60 minutes.
The narrative inquiry section o f the interview draws out the details o f the scene,
character, plot, and actions in order to determine patterns, themes, and qualities related to core
values development and current use. Questions were asked in a semi-structured interview
process (Klenke, 2008; Webster & Mertova, 2007), in order to have sufficient structure to focus
the conversation but allow flexibility to gain more in-depth detail via follow-up questions,
clarification, and other probing techniques. Open-ended questions were used to elicit details
(Webster & Mertova, 2007), including phrases and language that might reveal more insight on
core values. Follow-up questions were employed to ascertain more detail about why certain
perceptions, interactions, and courses o f action occurred. As recommended by Seidman (2013),
the interviewer listened intensively, explored statements without sharing bias or assumptions,
probed when laughter occurred, and asked the participants to reconstruct rather than remember
incidents. A narrative inquiry interview guide was developed and used (Appendix H) (Patton,
2002; Rubin & Rubin, 2012; Seidman, 2013) to confirm that all research questions were

41

addressed and to remind the investigator o f techniques for probing, listening, and deepening the
narrative inquiry process. Techniques include phrases recommended in the interview literature to
elicit more detail in a conversational and unintimidating way.
Because of the dispersed study population, the interviews were conducted via telephone
with audio recording to produce a written transcript. The investigator made efforts to establish
respectful rapport and connect in ways that would put the participants at ease in talking about
their core values, life stories, and leadership perspective.
Data Quality
Webster and Mertova (2007) discuss integrity issues with narrative inquiry and state the
importance o f the trustworthiness o f notes and transcripts. In order to ensure the trustworthiness
of the narratives, the interviews were recorded and transcribed. In addition, the researcher took
notes during the calls, as recommended by Burke and Miller (2001) and others, in order to
confirm all questions were answered and as a back-up data collection method in case the
recording device or system did not work properly for some or all o f the interview. The recording
method was tested prior to use for data collection to ensure proper operation.
As suggested by Webster and Mertova (2007), transcriptions were sent to each
participant so that each could correct errors and add more details prior to the analysis. This
qualitative method o f developing a relationship between the participants and the researcher is
designed to ensure verisimilitude and authenticity o f the stories, which are also key components
of validity and reliability (Klenke, 2008; Webster & Mertova, 2007). In addition, efforts were
made throughout the research process for relationship development. For example, the researcher
e-mailed and called the participants to establish a rapport in an effort to build trust prior to the
interview. The researcher focused on being prompt, clear, and respectful, even formal, in

42

communications (Seidman, 2013). This purposeful approach was designed to build trust so that
the resulting stories would be described thoroughly in order to have more reliable data and valid
results (Webster & Mertova, 2007).
This research required thoroughly documenting and analyzing story narratives told by the
public library directors. In order to analyze the data, the investigator used the method o f restory
(Cresswell, 2008) to distill and arrange the plot, characters, and events chronologically in order
to clarify events, themes, and meaning. Restorying requires attention to the original narrative in
order to represent clearly the intent and meaning o f the initial story told. To this end, all restory
work included re-listening to the original recording o f the story to glean additional tone, vocal
emphasis, and language in order to ensure the retelling captured the original intent.
The interview instrument was pre-tested with Kathleen De Long, a graduate o f the
Simmons College Managerial Leadership in Libraries (MLIP) doctoral program, who used
narrative inquiry in her research (De Long, 2012). She reviewed the study objectives and
research questions as well as the interview instrument, and suggested clarifying that critical
incidents can be positive as well as negative so that the participants would consider both types o f
incidents. She also discussed the need to prompt the participants to clarify what event made them
rethink their values by asking a question about a decision point in which they consciously chose
to use their values. In addition, she suggested that the 60-minute timeframe was limiting, and a
plan needed to be in place if a participant was interested in continuing to talk at the time or at a
later date.
Additional pre-testing was conducted with two MLIP students, Renee Di Pilato and
Cynthia Landrum, as well as Debbi MacLeod, Director o f the Colorado Talking Book Library.
They indicated that the questions and process were generally clear, although a few semantic

43

issues arose. For example, the term “critical incidents” was thought to be ambiguous and “critical
events” was suggested as a clearer term. Although the defining moments literature refers to
critical incidents and the study objectives do as well, in the interview instrument the term critical
events is used to provoke stories using more common language. For this reason, both terms will
be used in this study to refer to the same phenomenon. Another confusing term from the
literature is “trigger,” which is used to identify critical incidents that provoke defining moments,
so the question was reworded to remove the term trigger. In addition, as suggested by one pre­
test participant, the word “story” was added to the instructions to clarify that the narrative inquiry
process involves in-depth storytelling.
In the formation o f values section o f the interview, some o f the pre-test interviewees
talked about core values that were distinctly different from the values discussed in the section
related to defining moments. For this reason, the values discussed in the section on defining
moments are not necessarily those that most influence the directors’ work. The two sets o f
questions stand somewhat independent o f each other, and the section including formation of
values applies specifically to one value they identify as most informing their work.
The three pre-test interviews all were completed within 60 minutes. The first interviewee
suggested that clear definitions o f core values, critical events, and defining moments be provided
along with the questions. In the subsequent pre-test interviews, the two test participants said the
definitions aided them in preparing for the interview by clarifying the concepts and questions to
be addressed. Based on pre-test feedback, the investigator revised the interview questions and
process, including the study instructions, in order to prepare participants sufficiently for the
interview portion of the data-gathering process.

44

MacLeod, who is not associated with the Simmons College doctoral program, completed
the values questionnaire and stated that the online questionnaire was straight-forward, the results
resonated and assisted her in identifying two defining moments, and the process o f reflecting on
the critical events and her values responses was beneficial and enjoyable. She had few
suggestions for changing the process or the interview questions and was able to answer the
questions thoroughly and address additional probing questions within an hour. Thus, this revised
process was what the investigator used with study participants.
Conclusion
Values are enduring beliefs that influence human thoughts, decisions, and behaviors.
Because they are deeply held, values are not always used consciously or purposefully.
Nonetheless, research has not probed public library directors about their values and connected
the values to defining moments. These moments provide a context for understanding how
individuals prioritize and use values in their work. At the same time, there is an opportunity to
examine the changes in values based on work contexts o f managerial leaders. Because public
library directors lead community institutions, their values may inform not only their role as
library director but the values of the organization and their position as a community leader.
Through this process, study participants completed the values questionnaire and provided
rich detail through narrative inquiry. The general findings, as revealed in the next chapter,
indicate commonly held values in their work as well as common types o f critical incidents,
values conflicts, and strategies for overcoming challenges. These themes will be generally
reported in chapter two with common themes analyzed in the subsequent chapters.

CHAPTER TWO
GENERAL FINDINGS

O f the 15 public library directors approached to participate in the study, 12 did so for a
response rate o f 80%. The 12 participants work in eight states in the Northeast, Midwest, and
western United States; 75% (nine) o f the directors are women and 25% (three) are men. Four
participants have served as library directors for more than 20 years, four between 10 and 20
years, and four for fewer than 10 years. With regard to education, seven o f the directors have
earned a master’s degree in library and information science (MLIS); and three hold master’s
degrees in other disciplines, either in business administration (MBA), mathematics, or the arts.
Two have bachelor degrees as their highest completed degree, one o f whom attended a MLIS
program for one semester. These two have attended library-related continuing education
programs.
The 12 directors oversee public libraries that serve a variety o f communities. One directs
a combined school and public library in a rural town with a budget o f less than $50,000; another
directs a rural library with a budget between $100,000 and $200,000. Five directors oversee
community libraries with one building and budgets ranging from $200,000 to $4.9 million. Three
oversee multiple building library systems with budgets between $5 million and $29.9 million;
and two oversee large urban library systems with budgets exceeding $30 million. Table 2.1 lists
the study participants, their library budget ranges, educational attainment, and total number o f
years in the position o f library director (in any public library).

Four participants are nearing retirement, and they welcomed the opportunity to reflect
more deeply about core values and gain a richer perspective on the meaning o f their work. For
example, one stated that she had not thought much about her values and was looking forward to
using the values lens not only to assess her accomplishments but also to understand her
motivations. All participants expressed perceived benefits to being involved in the study, which
will be described in more detail at the end o f this chapter. Participants were thoughtful and
thorough in answering the questionnaire, reflecting on the questions, and engaging in the

55

interview process. Many spoke o f preparations they had made for the interview and referred to
notes they had compiled.
PVQIV Results
All participants completed the PVQIV either online or in print. As described in chapter
one, the instrument includes 40 portrait statements o f particular people and requires the
participants to rate to what extent each portrait is like them. Each portrait statement represents a
person who holds a particular value, such as one who likes to be successful, honest, or polite,
without stating the value associated with the statement (see Appendix E for questionnaire).
Participants were given portrait statements using gender pronouns that coincided with their
gender, and asked to rank, on a scale from “ 1” to “6,” how much they are like the person in the
statement. One is equated with “not at all like me,” and six is equated with “very much like me.”
When totaling the numeric “likeness” scores, the specific portrait values rankings are
combined into 10 overarching values, including achievement (successful, capable, ambitious, and
influential); benevolence (helpful, honest, forgiving, loyal, and responsible); and conformity
(politeness, obedient, self-discipline, and honoring parents) (Schwartz, 2012) (see Table 1.1 for
the overarching value associated with each portrait value).
These overarching values are also referred to as motivational values. In the study, the
investigator entered the numeric “likeness” scores for each participant into a customized
spreadsheet developed based on coding instructions provided by Schwartz (personal
correspondence, January 18, 2012). The data entry was reviewed three times for each participant
to confirm accuracy and maintain reliability. The spreadsheet was constructed to calculate the
respondent’s mean score for each motivational value by adding the individual’s numeric scores
for each portrait related to that motivational value, and then dividing that sum by the total

56

number o f portraits for that value. For example, the portrait statements 5, 14, 21, 31, and 35 are
associated with elements o f the motivational value “security.” The numeric values selected for
these five portraits were totaled and divided by five to determine each respondent’s mean score
for security. The respondent’s mean score for each motivational value was then subtracted from
his or her mean score for all portrait answers. This calculation is a normalizing strategy because
some participants answer the questions by selecting the highest and lowest ranges while others
tend to answer in the middle range o f options. Averaging all in relation to the total mean score is
a mechanism Schwartz (S. H. Schwartz, personal correspondence, January 18, 2012)
recommends to normalize scores.
The respondents’ totals for each motivational value, after being subtracted from their
overall mean score, include values with positive numbers (above their average), and negative
numbers (below their average). The highest numbers indicate the values most deeply held, and
the lowest numbers indicate values that are not held, and in some cases disdained (those with the
largest negative numbers). Table 2.2 lists the values calculations for each participant rounded to
the second decimal. Bold scores indicate the top value for each participant, and the top value
overall among all participants, and the italicized numbers represent the second highest scores.

The highest ranked value for six participants was benevolence, and a seventh scored it
highest along with self-direction. An additional three participants had benevolence as their
second highest ranking value, making this the highest ranked overall motivational value among
the total values o f all 12 participants, with a mean score o f 1.2. One participant had a
benevolence score below his average and therefore not it was among his top values.
The second highest scoring motivational value overall was self-direction (1.12), which
was the highest value for four participants and the second highest for an additional two. All
participants in the study have self-direction scores above their mean score, making it the most
commonly held core value overall.
Universalism (1.02) was the third highest scoring motivational value. Two participants’
scores indicated this as their highest ranking value, and five scored it as their second highest

58

ranking value. As with self-direction, universalism was a value that all participants rated above
their average score, making it the second highest ranking value among all participants.
The values o f stimulation, hedonism, achievement, and conformity had mixed rankings
among the participants. Stimulation was the fourth highest value among the total group with a
score o f 0.09; seven rated stimulation above their average score, and five had it below their
mean. H alf o f the participants’ results placed hedonism above their average, including one
participant who had a hedonism score second among his 10 motivational values. One third of the
participants rated achievement above their average scores, and another third o f participants gave
conformity a rating above their average mean score.
With regard to the lowest ranking values among the participants, tradition was lowest
with an overall mean score o f -1.45, and power was also low at -1. The scores for these two
values were low for nearly all participants; only two participants scored rated tradition or power
above the average mean score for their values.
With regard to specific portrait statements, the highest overall score o f 5.75 out o f six (six
indicating very much like me) was:
27. It is important to him/her to respond to the needs o f others. He/she tries to support
those he/she knows (benevolence).
All or most participants rated the following individual portraits high:
8. It is important to him/her to listen to people who are different from him/her. Even
whenhe/she disagrees with them, he/she still wants to understand them (5.67,
universalism).
19. He/she strongly believes that people should care fo r nature. Looking after the
environment is important to him/her (5.67, universalism).

59

22. He/she thinks it's important to be interested in things. He/she likes to be curious and
to try to understand all sorts o f things (5.67, self-direction).
3. He/she thinks it is important that every person in the world be treated equally. He/she
Believes everyone should have equal opportunities in life (5.58, universalism).
29. He/she wants everyone to be treated justly, even people he/she doesn’t know. It is
important to him/her to protect the weak in society (5.58, universalism)
(Based on S. H. Schwartz, personal correspondence, January 18, 2012).
PVQIV Relational Values Reports
Each participant received a report, which listed his or her values in order based on
answers to the questionnaire. The report also included a pie chart, which displayed the
motivational values in a visually relational way with the top/right values associated with self­
transcendence, a motivation for societal enhancement (benevolence, universalism); the lower/
right o f the chart related to the values that conserve and preserve the current societal structure
(conformity, tradition, and security); the lower/left relating to individual enhancement (power,
achievement, and hedonism); and the upper left/relating to openness to change (hedonism,
stimulation, and self-direction) (see Figure 1.1 for the pie chart o f Schwartz’s Theoretical Model
o f Relations among the 10 Values). Figure 2.1 displays a compilation o f the motivational values
charts o f all 12 participants with their top values highlighted in yellow and lesser values
priorities in light yellow.
The visual representation of the top values within the context o f the overall chart o f
values illustrates the strong motivation among all participants for self-transcendence and
openness to change. As visually indicated in Figure 2.1, all participants have the top right
quadrant highlighted, and many have the upper left quadrant highlighted, which illustrates the

60

strong motivation for self-transcendence, motivation for societal change, and openness to change
among all participants. In contrast, no participants had conservation values (security, tradition,
conformity) as highly motivating to their work. Some participants had core values motivated by
self-enhancement while others did not.

Summary
The results o f the standardized values questionnaire indicate that the 12 study participants
share common motivations related to universal values, such as social justice, equality, tolerance,
and protection o f the environment. In addition, the results o f all but one participant indicate
motivation based on benevolence, specifically related to preserving and enhancing the welfare o f
those near to them. Self-direction, particularly as this value relates to being curious and learning
new things, was also indicated as a strong motivating value for all participants. Although each of
the participant’s responses and subsequent values report was unique, general motivational
tendencies include enhancing the welfare o f others and being open to change. No discernible
values distinctions were found based on library budget size, educational degree, time as a
director, or gender.
General Interview Findings
After answering the PVQIV questionnaire, participants received a report indicating their
individual values results, and directions for the interview, including a series o f definitions of
values, critical events, and defining moments as well as the standardized questions for the
interview (Appendix G). Then each engaged in an individual, one-hour telephone interview
during which they described two critical incidents that led to defining moments, discussed how
they formed their values and priorities (prompted by specific interview questions), and reflected
on how those values related to their work.
The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Each transcription was re-read and
corrected while listening to the audio recording and each participant was sent a revised transcript
o f his or her interview to make comments, additions, or changes. Two directors made

63

clarifications on their transcripts, and the other 10 indicated that their transcript accurately
recorded the conversation.
The transcripts were imported into NVivo software6 and sections o f each transcript were
associated with 48 nodes, or unique themes, which were coded using the software (Appendix I).
More specific values themes were identified through hand coding the values, critical incidents,
and defining moments. To analyze the 12 transcripts (181 pages o f single spaced text of
interviews) thoroughly the investigator used concept mapping (Butler-Kisber & Poldma, 2010)
in which broad concepts, such as values and critical incidents, were drawn visually on large
sheets o f paper in order to reveal relationships and common themes. Concept mapping is a visual
form o f inquiry used as a nonlinear process for analysis. By listing, for example, the 24 critical
incidents identified by each participant on a large sheet o f paper, the investigator was able to
analyze the graphically displayed lists and determine relational understanding and connections
among the critical incidents.
Critical Incidents and Defining Moments
At the beginning of the interviews, each participant told two stories o f critical incidents
that led to defining moments in their work. Although they were asked to talk about defining
moments in their roles as library directors, two reflected on incidents in their professional careers
prior to becoming library directors because the impact o f the events have had a major influence
on the values they use in their current positions. Table 2.3 displays the types o f critical incidents
participants identified when describing defining moments and the context o f these situations.

data, including interview transcripts and other text and non-text content.

*Note “New to Position” indicates critical incidents that occurred within the first year o f
beginning a new position. “Unexpected” refers to unanticipated critical incidents.
Participants identified a variety o f critical incidents that prompted defining moments
including seven stories requiring the director to resolve personnel issues related to either poor
performance based on standard expectations (3) or unacceptable performance because library
staff members were resistant to change initiatives in the library (4). Critical incidents also
involved performance issues o f previous library directors (3) and the activities involved in
resolving legacy issues. Other situations that prompted defining moments o f public library
directors were library building projects (3), conflicts with the governing authority (2), being
wrongly accused o f inappropriate or illegal conduct (2), and intellectual freedom challenges by
outspoken community members. The critical incidents in which more than one participant
experienced the issue will be discussed in this section.
In addition to the specific types o f critical incidents that prompted defining moments,
Table 2.3 also displays the context o f these situations. Thirteen o f the 24 defining moments,
54%, occurred when participants were new to their positions; and 12 defining moments, 50%,

65

related to managing some type o f changes in the library. Managing change prompted defining
moments at different stages, including three participants who described the challenges o f
deciding which changes to make and/or how to make them. Four participants discussed staff
resistance to change as the critical issue and two stories focused on disagreement with the
governing authority on change methods. Also, three directors were involved in building projects
which changed library services. Another contextual aspect was that nine o f the 24 critical
incidents (37.5%) were unexpected and often disruptive situations, which required urgent
attention and/or prompt action.
Because participants spoke o f critical incidents within the context o f defining moments,
the following section outlines participant narratives both to illustrate the experiences and
highlight the values o f these experiences.
Personnel Issues
In participant stories of defining moments, seven (29%) critical incidents related to
personnel issues including staff resistance to the director’s preferred direction for the library and
employees who were simply not doing the job they were hired to do. Participants described
different methods to address these issues as outlined below.
Staff Resistance to Change
In managing organizational change, four participants possessed a clear understanding o f
what changes needed to occur and the critical incidents involved specific employees who resisted
the way they were managing change or the ultimate goal o f the change. One participant
described a series o f critical events that occurred when she accepted a youth services
management position at a library with a culture focused on library procedures rather than on
library services to the public. This participant’s critical incidents involved her direct reports who,

66

due to the library system’s focus on procedures rather than service, were resistant to her leading
change initiatives in the library. She was frustrated and considered going back to a previous job
with the values that more aligned with hers.
In talking with her husband, she realized that she had a vision for how services could be
more vital in public libraries, and she realized she had the capacity to change the current library
culture. She then began to make the changes she thought needed to be made. She explained, “I
came back to my job and I looked at it very differently. I approached it at that point as how do I
teach people here how to provide great service ... I spent that next year doing th a t... and
because o f those choices and those decisions, it turns out in 18 months after that or a little longer,
I was [named] director o f the library.”
Her defining moment o f deciding to remain at the library led her to strive for her vision
and become more responsible, which, in turn, instilled confidence in her that allowed her to
overcome resistance. For example, the librarians refused to weed the collection, including non­
fiction, despite the fact that many materials were outdated. In response, she gathered volunteers
and others to do the weeding. The librarians kept the boxes o f outdated books and told her these
would go on the shelf when she resigned. However, she remained and made changes, such as
reducing a 12-page list o f rules down to one and a half pages. This also upset the librarians who
thought fewer rules would result in significant problems with children. Eventually, several o f the
librarians whom she stated, “valued the library profession more than library services” retired and
she was able to hire others with values more aligned with her own. Ultimately, her choice to
continue at the library and to make changes resulted in a library oriented toward innovative
services that the community uses heavily.

67

Another participant explained that changes were already in place in the library system to
increase access to popular materials, similar to a bookstore. The director realized that some o f
the managers were resistant to this service model and either needed to embrace the new ways or
leave voluntarily or through personnel action. The director and other direct supervisors
developed a communications plan to address the resistant employees with directed conversations,
such as stating specific behaviors that needed to change. The participant explained that this was a
defining moment because o f the conscious choice to be direct, yet respectful, with personnel
rather than being polite or placating. The shift also clarified the library vision and defined how
personnel would be selected and managed in the future. The participant stated that these actions
created a stronger library culture in which everyone felt more aligned in their work and overt
about personnel issues.
Two additional participants described organizational change at the administrative level
and the resistance o f their director-level subordinates. One participant reorganized reporting lines
so that the finance director reported to the library director rather than the board. In another case,
the development director and board president attempted to restructure the library Friends and
Foundation groups, while the director was on extended leave. Both participants described a
process o f communicating and coaching the resistant subordinates in an effort to align them with
the way the director thought was more effective. After months o f tension and conflict, in these
two instances the administrative personnel who were in conflict with the directors chose to leave
the organizations and the president o f the board was not reappointed.
In the previous four situations, the directors were involved in power struggles, which
ended in resistant employees leaving the organizations. In all cases, the library directors stated
that they were clear about what needed to occur and attempted to persuade employees to follow

68

their leadership. The defining aspect in common was that the directors persisted even when it
meant losing the relationships with the staff members. Also in each o f these cases, the decision
and commitment to specific values were not only defining for the directors but also defined the
future direction o f these organizations. Although these staff issues involved philosophical
differences about the fundamental values o f the library as well as how those values get
implemented, other issues with employees occurred in this study that required personnel action.
Poor Staff Performance
Three participants described critical incidents in which they had to address personnel
performance issues and the negative impact on the library. One director explained the challenge
o f working with staff members who were not providing friendly, helpful service, which is one of
her core values for the library. She was uncomfortable with confronting these staff members and
discussed the awkwardness of having these conversations. In other situations the participants
described stronger confidence in managing these personnel issues.
In another account o f a defining moment involving employee performance, the
participant transitioned from being one o f the staff to becoming the library director. At that time,
one o f the library staff members was not performing satisfactorily, and the new director realized
she needed to act. The participant explained, “For me, that was a big deal because that’s when I
stepped out o f the room, so to speak, and became separate, and the leader o f everyone; and
therefore, I had different rules I had to play by that were much more exacting o f me than anyone
else here.” This experience instilled the value o f responsibility in this participant, who stated,
One person who wasn’t performing and refusing to perform couldn’t be here
if it meant the rest o f us weren’t going to be able to perform. And it was my
responsibility to take care of that. No one else could do that. So I stepped up

69

and did it. And ever since then, I’ve been able to do those things when they’ve
needed to be done. And people who work here trust that I will, and they’re
calm about it because I don’t do it in a cavalier way and I’m not a destructive
person.
Another participant described a long-time employee who, for various reasons, was
missing too much work, reporting work time when she had not been at work, and not doing her
work at the level expected. When confronted with these behaviors and asked to improve, the
employee was hostile and proceeded to spread rumors about the director throughout the
community. The director o f this small town library described the difficulty o f having to
reprimand this staff member in an effort to see performance change while community members
were becoming aware o f the internal staff issue. However, the infractions became so blatant that
with counsel from the town manager and support from the library board, the director proceeded
with disciplinary action. The participant described the values conflict as a feeling o f loyalty
toward the staff member, whom she had worked with and mentored over time, versus a strong
commitment to honesty and integrity toward library services and the community. She said, “I’m
loyal to the library and the people that look at the institution for integrity and all the people in the
town that work really hard and don’t take advantage. So it’s been a good lesson in trying to find
inner strength.”
In each o f these narratives, values were central to the work as well as to personnel
conflicts. At times, library workers were simply not performing as needed and the directors felt
conflicted between the values o f loyalty (to staff) and responsibility (to the needs of the
community). In all cases, the directors maintained authority to make changes, committed to
specific values priorities, articulated why the changes needed to be made, and removed people

70

from or coached people out o f the organization who did not adapt to the changes. The
professional values o f quality service, accountability to the public, and service for all were
underlying motivational themes in the narratives o f all participants. Additional values themes
articulated by the participants were responsibility, courage, adaptability, and respect.
Previous Director Issues
Three study participants discussed defining moments related to previous directors’
mismanagement. One participant described a circumstance in which a previous director was
secretive and removed by the board. Another spoke o f a former director who mishandled
situations without board knowledge, and a third conveyed a story o f a former director who
pressured staff to accommodate her requests that they work on her personal projects after she had
retired from the library
One participant explained how she responded to being named the director after the
removal o f the former director who left under clouded circumstances, which were not disclosed
in the interview. She described her approach as follows,
The first thing that I did when I came in was I took down the walls so
everybody could see everything that I was doing, and so that the level o f trust
could be reestablished because trust was really taken away. The trustees lost
their faith in themselves because they hired a person who shouldn’t have been
in that position. And it’s a small town; when somebody presented themselves
in a certain way, they believed that person. So it was really rebuilding that
sense o f trust and also letting the trustees rebuild their confidence in
themselves and knowing that they could trust the person that they put in place
to run the department.

In addition, she realized that the library board meetings were “like tea parties” in which everyone
agreed without discussion. She provided trustee training on their roles and responsibilities, and
she stated, “I taught them how to read a budget and to go line by line down and to question me
when there was something that they didn’t understand. And now they are very comfortable doing
that. So I have a group o f trustees that take their responsibilities seriously and communicate that
to the rest o f the community.” She summed up that the values she brought to her position were
“dedication and hard work and honesty and transparency because the previous director had left
under bad circumstances.”
In another case, after the study participant became the new director, she learned o f the
previous director’s mishandling o f issues. The participant did not provide specific details about
the issues yet indicated that both the former director and the board had acted either with
incompetence or misconduct. “The conflict that I had was protecting the board and the
community from the knowledge versus protecting the board and the community from the
consequences if the issues weren't fixed.” The circumstances were further challenging because
the former director was well liked, and the board ultimately was responsible for the results o f the
previous director’s actions, and therefore learning o f this situation might make them defensive
and angry.
The study participant described weighing both options before deciding to inform the
board and seek legal counsel in order to resolve the issues with integrity. She explained,
I hurt them and I made them feel incompetent, but I made the decision that it
was my role .. .my role was to protect them from litigation. Also part o f that
issue was that that [decision] hurt me in their eyes. Because if anybody read

72

between the lines they realized that they had not picked up on these things and
nobody likes to be told that they did something wrong.
The director indicated that the values conflict was between being responsible in her role as the
library director and to the library board, and being in good standing with the board. She felt this
action would jeopardize her position, but she decided her actions were the right course.
Ultimately, the values this incident reinforced in the director was a commitment to responsibility
and taking the job duties seriously.
Another study participant explained a defining moment in which the former director,
well-loved in the community and profession, asked a staff member to work on her personal
projects after she had retired from the library. The staff person felt conflicted, and approached
the new director, one of this study’s participants. He contacted the former director, his previous
mentor, and informed her that the library personnel would not devote time and resources to her
project. In the interview, the participant explained that, although he felt loyalty to the previous
director, he was conscious o f the responsibility the library had to the taxpayers and did not
believe it was legal or ethical to be using tax-funded personnel and resources for this personal
project. The value o f integrity and responsibility for the library resources outweighed the value
o f loyalty to a former mentor and employee.
Building Projects
Three participants described library building construction projects as critical incidents
that prompted defining moments. In one case, a director, who has an MBA rather than an MLIS,
described acquiring funding for a new building project. She worked with architects, contractors,
and construction workers on the library building using her skills and knowledge o f business
practices, negotiations, and project management. In the process, she understood why she had

73

accepted the position o f library director. She realized that she was uniquely qualified for the
position as library director, and that she applied her skills and talents in ways that fundamentally
made a difference to the community. The process o f the building project helped instill
confidence in her role as library director.
Another director described a defining moment related to a building project that occurred
in her first five years as director. The project involved planning and building a new library, and
the final step was to coordinate approximately 100 community volunteers to move the collection
from the old building to the new one. This was a challenging project to manage with a lot of
people. She explained,
So the day o f the move was such an extraordinary community event. And the
plan worked, but it also was open enough that different volunteers came up
with ingenious ways to enhance the whole process. And I felt that that day we
- the library belongs to the community - but I felt like that day, we really
gave the library to the community and it created this atmosphere and
environment o f ownership on a very personal basis for people.
She explained that this event strengthened her confidence to manage large community projects
but also created an experience in which members o f the community really felt ownership o f the
library. In this way, the experience was defining in terms o f the confidence she had in her
abilities and the result also was defining for the way the community viewed the library. She
described that, from that point forward, community ownership has been the focus o f library
operations and has confirmed her strong belief in the role o f the library to enhance the
community and improve lives.

74

A third library director reached a different conclusion while working on a library building
project. She also was a new director, and previously had managed initiatives on her own, taking
credit for them. In this case, she was working with a team that included someone skilled at
negotiation and another member who was experienced with overseeing construction details. The
participant added her skills in fundraising and relationship building to the team. In one instance,
she was not copied on an e-mail message about the construction and became upset because she
believed that, as the director, she should have been included in the communication. However, she
had an insight that this really was not the right response, and that she could let go o f certain
aspects o f the project and trust her team members to take care o f their responsibilities. She
explained, “It was that moment o f understanding that everybody had something incredible to
contribute that was going to make this a success. That was the ‘aha’ moment for me.” She
changed her method from tracking all aspects o f the project to trusting those with other strengths
to manage certain elements of it. More importantly, her insight was that leadership needs to be
shared throughout the team, and she has applied this value o f collaboration and shared
responsibility and recognition to other initiatives. She explained, “Leaders do best when they
understand that they’re not running the whole show, and they can’t take credit for everything;
and everything should not just be a reflection on them as individuals, but what is really important
is how it reflects on the institution.” This focus on institutional impact shifted her to lead the
organization differently, to grow the talent o f employees, and to use the unique strengths o f
trustees and other high level library stakeholders.
Library Reorganization
Three narratives identified the critical incident at the beginning o f the process o f
changing the organization. In these cases, the participants recognized that change was needed

75

and they had to determine how to reorganize the library to achieve better performance. The
participant at the smallest library described how she chose to overlook circulation rules in order
to encourage at-risk poor children to use the library. Although this might not appear to be a
major reorganization to a library, she stated, “My goal was to change the thinking here that we
have to be so concerned about a $12 book, or replacing a book, or sticking to the rules versus the
impact it has on that child’s learning, or their future love o f learning, or just having a place that
they feel safe and comfortable.” Because this is a major philosophical shift from rules to
encouraging learning in a library in a situation with few employees serving a small community,
this change was described and is categorized as library reorganization.
She explained, “I did meet a little resistance, but I mean, in general, since my staff is so
small, it was a pretty easy thing.” She summarized,
The defining moment was realizing my role as a librarian can be so much
more than just someone who checks in and out books. It’s someone w ho’s
more o f a service to the community. Really, in any job you have that
opportunity to have that impact. But I don’t think I realized until I started
dealing and working with a lot o f kids, especially the ones that didn’t have
anywhere to go, or that were afraid to check out books, that you can have an
impact.
Library change in a small library can be easier because o f the small staff, yet the values shift that
occurred with this director had the potential to create a culture change in which children were
more welcome and prioritized over rules.
In another story a participant described being new to a large library system and realizing
that the strategies he used in previous smaller libraries systems would not be effective. He

76

described that the critical question was how to establish the type o f culture and values that
encourage consistent, quality conduct among employees across the organization. After many
conversations with community leaders, reading and investigation, including a tour o f a library
system in another country, and writing several versions o f strategic plans, he became clear on the
way to proceed. The library system developed clear expectations through values statements,
training, and systemic processes for monitoring staff performance in order to ensure consistent
adherence to four key values. He stated, “I spend a lot o f time on values in this organization. It is
rare that an enterprise-wide communication from me goes out without some mention o f one o f
the ... values [of the organization].” The process o f determining the values as well as
establishing them as norms was defining both for him and for the organization.
A third director spoke o f a defining moment after she had been at the library for many
years and library use began to decrease. She explained that she always felt the library should be
the hub o f the community, and when the number o f visitors and items checked out began to drop,
she felt an urgency to make changes in order for the library to remain relevant to community
members. She read professional blogs, attended conferences, and engaged in meetings to discuss
library trends. After a particularly compelling conference, she realized that library services
needed to shift from a primary focus on providing access to books and information and to
becoming a community center for interactions, meaningful learning experiences, and idea
generation. To this end, library personnel removed older books, rearranged furniture, provided
more open spaces for people to meet to share ideas, and offered increased programming with
interactive activities. She explained the challenge o f making these changes this way, “I could put
together a logical argument for why the world is changing and how we had to change with it.
And I will say I didn’t bring most of my staff along. My staff just were not interested.” She felt

77

certain o f the need for change, which resulted in the cataloger and reference librarian resigning,
allowing her to hire new people whose values aligned with her new vision o f the library.
Although this defining moment includes library personnel resistance, similar to the stories above,
the director did not identity this challenge as defining. She spoke o f the issue o f needing to make
changes that engaged the community in library use as the compelling critical incident and
defining challenge she overcame.
Conflict with Governing Authority
Although participants spoke confidently about making changes among employees whom
they supervise, different challenges arose when the critical incident involved their supervisors.
Public library governing authorities vary and, in the case o f the two stories about conflict, one
participant’s supervisor is the county manager, and in the other a library board o f trustees is the
governing authority over the library and the supervisor o f the director. In both cases, the
participants discussed defining moments o f values conflicts with supervisors, and specifically
scenarios in which they planned changes that involved more risk than their supervisors would
tolerate. In one case, the library was launching a campaign to renew temporary funding, but the
director and many other library staff and supporters had been working on a larger ballot initiative
that would have made the library a permanent taxing district. The county manager who oversaw
the library believed the renewal, a less risky approach, was the appropriate path. The director and
many community stakeholders disagreed. Additionally, the director disagreed with the lack o f
stakeholder input on the county manager’s final decision to refer the renewal. The participant
described several values conflicts including,
... the conflict in my values and specifically in the supervisor’s values. And I
think even a little bit between my own, the need to be responsible to him ...

78

And then feeling so strongly about transparency and honesty with my staff but
having to toe a line that I didn't want to toe.
When faced with these values conflicts with the county manager, the director had to
follow his directives even though she did not agree. In the second case, the director had received
a grant to establish a computer lab in the library. The library board members were angry that the
director accepted the grant because they believed the library’s role was to provide books and that
offering computer access did not apply to its mission. The participant explained,
I knew that we should be doing better for the community; that we needed to
be in the Internet age. And the way it played out was eventually I kept talking
and they grudgingly allowed me to go ahead and get the lab, which we did,
which set a standard for technology for our library that we’ve maintained.
The defining moment for this director involved standing up to the board and articulating
what the community really needed. In this case she left the library in protest, but later returned to
the directorship. This approach established how she has worked with the board ever since. She
talked about how this incident gave her the confidence to continue to be a change agent.
Wrongly Accused
Two study participants spoke o f defining moments in which they were wrongly accused
o f misconduct and how those experiences inform the way they now conduct themselves at work.
In one case, the participant was in a middle management position and was falsely accused by the
finance director o f not submitting financial materials. It was the financial director who had not
completed her work and instead reported to the library board that the participant was in the
wrong. The current library director believed the finance director rather than the middle manager
without further investigation. It was not until later when the finance director again was in error,

79

and in this circumstance told the library board that it was the director’s fault, that the director
became aware o f the pattern. The finance director was forced out, and eventually, when the
director retired, the middle manager became director. He explained that he reflects on this
incident when disagreements occur within the library. He carefully investigates and verifies
information prior to taking action to resolve the situation and reprimand staff. The participant
identified the values o f integrity and fairness as primary to this defining moment.
In another case, the participant was selected for the position and then accused o f having
inappropriate inside connections that allowed her to be named director. The subsequent months
of public scrutiny ended when it was apparent that the new director had acted with integrity, and
the accusations were false. Public scrutiny and mistrust had a significant impact on the director’s
orientation toward her work. She understood that her role included public, and even political,
scrutiny at a level she had not anticipated. Because o f this, she articulated the importance o f
balancing transparency with personal privacy. She stated that openness is important to being an
authentic leader, yet the director has to maintain a public persona because many equate her
personally with the institution o f the library.
Intellectual Freedom Challenges
Two directors spoke o f intellectual freedom challenges as critical incidents that led to
defining moments in their roles as directors. One described a situation in which an influential
member o f the community complained about a book his daughter was allowed to check out from
the library. After the children’s librarian and director both explained the policy and procedures
for materials reconsideration, the community leader refused to accept these methods and sought
to circumvent the process in order to have the book removed. So certain was he o f his views, he
started threatening to make difficulties for the library, such as advocating for library funding

80

reductions. The director undertook the reconsideration process, informed other community
leaders o f the issues, and gathered community support for the library’s role as a community
center for all ideas. She explained that this series o f threats only gave her more courage to stand
up for the fundamental value o f intellectual freedom and to educate the community proactively
about the public library’s role to offer open and free access to a diverse variety o f materials.
This event and her response were defining in that she became an outspoken leader on
intellectual freedom issues in the community, as well as in the state association and, later, in the
American Library Association. Prior to this incident, she had never thought o f herself as a leader,
but by speaking up, and because o f the response she received from those in the community and
the library profession, she began to understand her potential as a spokesperson for intellectual
freedom. The result was a clear sense o f purpose, confidence, and understanding that, when her
values are threatened, she will fight for what she believes in. She stated that the experience made
her realize, “I just couldn’t remain silent and that I can’t fear — the opposite happens with me
now that if someone threatens me it just makes me dig my heels in and gives me more courage to
speak out.” In summary, she said, “I think the legacy is that my community knows how
important intellectual freedom and privacy and confidentiality are in the library, and what that
institution means, and that really feels good.”
In the second story o f an intellectual freedom challenge, the director explained that a
group formed in the community in order to pressure the library to remove materials that it
deemed inappropriate. This group met at the library and recruited members in order to organize a
systematic campaign to meet its goals. The director attended the meetings, explaining, “I began
with this very watchful, and I think, suspicious attention on my part. I didn’t trust them and I
suppose, unconsciously, I thought o f them as the enemy.”

81

The director’s feeling changed when he realized that the group also had the right to meet
and discuss what they wished to discuss. Thus, rather than removing materials, the library began
purchasing materials that met the needs and interests o f this group. As this situation played out
over months, the director, much like the participant discussed in the previous example, became
vocal in the community to raise awareness about intellectual freedom. He wrote newspaper
articles and became known in the library community as an advocate for intellectual freedom.
Ultimately, the participant described the defining moment this way, “Instead o f being a defender
o f intellectual freedom, I was more a sympathetic voice to say, ‘I hear your complaint, but let me
talk to you about what the role o f the library is, why we are an asset to your family and to your
child.’” In this circumstance, the participant described this defining moment as instilling the
value o f respect for intellectual pursuits applied both to those who use the library as well as those
who challenge it.
Summary
During the interviews, participants discussed defining moments in which values they held
personally became more relevant for the organization. The incidents that prompted defining
moments varied yet those related to change and resolving poor performance were addressed
primarily internally. In the cases o f construction projects and intellectual freedom challenges, the
public was aware o f the circumstances, which placed added pressure on the directors involved. In
all cases, the defining moments illuminate several core values among the participants regardless
o f size o f library, number o f years o f experience, and educational background.
Values
During the interviews, participants discussed their values in three contexts. First, they
identified values that they affirmed or changed because o f defining moments. After that initial

82

discussion, the participants described the values that most influence their work and how those
were formed. In the final part o f the interview, participants identified how the role o f public
library director may have influenced their values priorities in their work. All participants
discussed specific values associated with defining moments, formative experiences, and the
position as library director by distinguishing different values for each section. Table 2.4 lists the
values each participant identified during the three sections o f the interview.

The values most discussed were professional values, such as intellectual freedom, access
for all, and privacy; interpersonal values, such as honesty, respect, fairness, and loyalty; and
ethical, organizational values, such as integrity, transparency, and commitment to library
performance excellence. Many participants stated that the values discussed had been present

84

throughout their lives and strengthened through work experiences, including defining moments.
Among participants, certain interpersonal values, such as loyalty, came into conflict with ethical
values o f honesty, integrity, and commitment to organizational effectiveness. The interviews
underscored that these values are employed internally when making decisions and considering
behavior, as well as in the organization with personnel and other stakeholders related to the
library.
The most commonly discussed professional values were customer service, learning and
literacy, intellectual freedom, and access for all. Three directors briefly discussed privacy, one in
great detail. One mentioned stewardship and several participants spoke o f accountability as it
related to stewardship. The overarching value, common among all library directors, was the
commitment to being responsible in their role as the organizational leader and as a civic leader.
Several participants also talked about the key role o f courage for staying true to values
during conflicts. They discussed the need to commit to their values consistently, to model them
through their actions, to self-regulate behavior, and to be flexible and adapt when change was
necessary. To further understand the primary values o f the participants as identified in the
interviews, the following sections describe the conversations related to the values o f honesty and
integrity, respect, fairness and equality, loyalty, learning and adaptability, and responsibility.
Honesty and Integrity
The most common value identified by participants was honesty. Typically, the concept o f
honesty related to how they conducted themselves at work and what they expected from others,
including library personnel. Statements about honesty often were accompanied by comments
about the significance o f integrity, transparency, and accountability. For example, a participant
summed up one o f her decisions about a defining moment in this way: “It was about honesty and

85

integrity and loyalty to an institution that I really believe in.” Three directors stated the
importance o f being honest publicly, open, and transparent. Another participant stated that, when
deciding on a resolution to a critical incident, “Integrity was a huge one. Self-respect was a huge
one and ... [a] sense o f credibility ... was a big part o f the transparency.” One participant stated,
“If you don’t have integrity, you have nothing; you know, that honesty is so important.”
While honesty and integrity were discussed with regard to how the directors and other
library personnel interacted in specific situations, the related concepts o f transparency and
accountability also were applied to library performance. One participant stated, “Excellence and
striving for the ideal outcome in everything that we do means certainly being supportive of
people but also being crystal clear about expectations and holding them accountable to deliver on
performance.”
Another explained his goals for rigorous accountability in this way,
I think it is a lot o f checking in with people around you because it is so easy to
deceive yourself; all o f the ways that you trick yourself into doing things that
are not all that good for you or good for the organization. So that is part o f it keep checking with people who see things differently from you. I think that
the second one is a big discussion that I have had within my organization
about what are the measures that matter.
Participants stated that they think a lot about how they and their organization are perceived in
terms o f accountability. One director explained,
I was in an interesting session a few weeks back at a conference about
transparency. They were talking about the tension between being transparent
and getting the work done. It was an interesting conversation because I have a

86

strong value for transparency; and I know for a fact there are times when I
hold back or I don't share all the details in the interest o f progress or
sometimes in the interest o f just strategy, and that's been a big one for me to
wrestle with.
In discussing the need to maintain accountability, some directors expressed a
commitment to being self-reflective and to self-regulate their behavior in an effort to have both
integrity and effective performance. One summed up this thought by saying, “It is not enough to
be good and know what you are about, but you have to live the values, and you have to hold
yourself accountable and things are supposed to get better at the end.”
Respect
Respect was another often mentioned value, though the participants spoke about it in a
variety o f forms, including respectful interactions, respect for others’ interests and opinions, and
respect for individuals’ rights to inquire and learn whatever they choose. With regard to one
defining moment, one participant explained the dynamic with staff as a new director which gave
her,
... the affirmation that people need to be treated with respect. And that these
are people that clearly loved the community and were serving their
community but, yet, weren’t respected by their [previous] boss. They
respected each other and loved each other and supported each other. Just to let
people have joy in the work that they do and value and be valued.
Other study participants mentioned their priority to hire personnel who exhibited respectful
behavior. One said, “I’ve hired people that respect the level o f learning, they respect people. ...
We all try to positively affect the quality o f the day for anybody that comes in the library.”

87

Along with seeking and encouraging respect among the employees and toward the public,
some director discussed upholding a respectful environment in the library by addressing rude
staff and, in some cases, rude patron behavior. One mentioned a perpetually rude elderly
gentleman whom she approached when he was yelling at a library employee. She calmly and
respectfully confirmed that he had the right to be angry but clarified that everyone needs to be
respectful. She stated that she expected people to be respectful with each other, with library
materials, and with library spaces.
In handling staff issues, respect was also a theme. One participant stated, “I think
ultimately we decided that being nice was disrespectful; that [by being nice] we were
encouraging people to engage in bad behavior that was destructive not only to themselves and
made them unhappy, but it really was destructive to the organization.” Rather than continue to
placate people who were not improving performance, the director held direct, respectful
conversations about what was and was not acceptable behavior.
Another director explained that he is intentional about being respectful to staff and others
because he holds a public position and needs to model respectful behavior for others. In addition,
the performance evaluation o f each employee includes ratings based on the level o f respect
exhibited both internally, with other employees, and with the public. In this way, respect is a
value interwoven into the organizational culture and the behavior o f personnel.
Participants also spoke o f respect in terms o f how they engage with library users’
information needs and interests. One stated, “I think the respect for our community - that’s
always been important to me. I actually hear what people are saying even if they’re not saying it
directly, and I can synthesize it. This isn’t about what I want; it is about what the community
wants. ... I have respect for the wisdom o f my community.” This quote mirrors many directors’

88

comments about customer service and captures the widely shared notion among participants that
the library should be a welcoming place in which people are treated with respect and encouraged
to pursue their various interests.
Other directors spoke specifically about respect as it related to diversity. Several
discussed the importance o f the library as being an institution that respects the diversity o f
people in the community. The discussions centered on respect both for people who were not like
them as well as respect for divergent interests and questions. Several participants articulated the
value o f respect and tolerance for diverse viewpoints as fundamental to their library work.
Fairness and Equality
Five participants discussed the value o f fairness from various perspectives. In three cases,
participants spoke o f fairness in terms o f focusing services to provide greater access to library
collections and services for low income patrons, minorities, and children with little parental
support. Two participants framed the concept o f access for all in terms o f social justice. Two
other participants described the importance o f fairness with regard to staff. In one case, the
director explained that all staff needed to be treated equally. Another explained that, when issues
arise, he considers all perspectives in order to make fair and balanced decisions. In discussions
about fairness, participants associated it with equality and/or equitable access for all. Five
directors emphasized the importance o f access to all information, particularly to ensure that all
people, regardless o f their background or ability, have equitable access to all information through
public libraries. In the case of access for all, depending on the participant, the value was
discussed either as one o f fairness or one o f respect.

89

Loyalty
Participants spoke o f loyalty on several occasions when they described conflicts among
values. In general, the participants expressed strong loyalty to personnel and to their supervisors
as well as the community at large. Many o f them stated that their position includes behaving in
loyal ways, such as being honest and open with staff, asking for their input to gather consensus,
and engaging in respectful and fair interactions. In addition, some participants described
coaching individual personnel and encouraging their professional development.
Some participants described how loyalty conflicted with other values, such as when
specific personnel were not doing the required work with integrity, or when change was
implemented for organizational effectiveness and staff members were resistant. In these cases,
individual loyalty to personnel was superseded by organizational accountability. One director
explained, “I felt m yself being tested every day in the sense that my loyalty, my support o f that
staff member, began to diminish and ... so my feelings about her work and about her loyalty to
me began to feel very much in question.” Three other directors spoke o f similar circumstances
in which they transitioned from months o f supporting and coaching specific personnel to having
to decide if there was any longer a fit. In most cases, the staff members left the organization;
however, in two circumstances the directors took more formal disciplinary action.
In addition, participants discussed loyalty as it related to the library board trustees and
county officials. Two participants told stories about being in disagreements about decisions made
by these governing authorities. Not only was there conflict about what to change, but values
conflicts arose in response to the way the change was managed. The directors wanted to elicit
feedback from stakeholders, staff, and a broader constituency in order to gain consensus about
the changes. However, the reporting authorities were more authoritative. These values conflicts

90

occurred when the loyalty the directors felt to those they reported to was pitted against their
loyalty to the staff and community stakeholders who would be affected by the changes. In both
cases, the directors had to negotiate and reflect on loyalties while remaining as honest and
transparent as possible. One participant stated, “You take your time in finding a solution and an
accommodation that’s going to work for everybody.”
Learning and Adaptability
An underlying value among all directors was learning and inquiry with regard to the
general public who use the library and library employees. As discussed earlier, the professional
value o f learning included inspiring children to love reading, encouraging community members
to pursue a wide variety o f subjects for inquiry and discovery, and creating a library culture that
is open to learning and engagement. Regarding staff, participants spoke o f listening to ideas and
appreciating the talents o f those who work in the library. They also discussed coaching and
supporting individuals in ways that develop the skills o f those that work for them. Participants
described the responsibility o f supervision as encouraging others to strive for improvement and
excellence in their work in the library and, ultimately, for the community.
The participants discussed approaches to their personal learning and development as well.
For example, one pointed out,
It’s a learning process. The job is constantly evolving. If you’re not changing
constantly, then you’re not doing something right. Because the way
technology’s changing— I mean, a current book might not be something that’s
around 20, 25 years from now. So, if you’re not willing to look at these things
and constantly be willing to change the way you lead, or change the way you
think, then you might take yourself out o f the game.

91

Another said, “Any time something doesn't work, or I see a staff member in distress, and it is not
necessary, I change it.” A third director spoke about the importance o f considering the
professional and personal circumstances o f those involved as well as the environment and timing
when making changes. She said,
So being situational and really being aware o f what’s going on in people’s
lives, having the ability to know when it is the right time to challenge
somebody to take on some new leadership or to get out o f their comfort zone
is a really important role of a leader. And, because it’s too easy to just fall into
this kind o f rut of let’s just do the same thing over and over and over again
because it’s easy and it doesn’t challenge me and I can go home and deal with
all the other stuff in my life. So it’s always a constant balance.
All participants reflected on learning in terms o f their own striving to be better,
encouraging their employees to excel, and establishing services so that community members
embrace learning, growth, and change. The theme o f continuous improvements was prominent
among participants.
Responsibility
As indicated in Table 2.3, responsibility was a common theme among the participants.
Many spoke o f taking their job “very seriously” because they were responsible to the staff, their
governing authority, the public, and the professional values in which they so strongly believed.
One said, “I really feel responsible for providing what we need and want in our community services for all people, which is a wide range of things. And I think it slows me down, makes me
think more about consequences.” In another case, the participant described his experiences as “a
feeling o f responsibility that we provide the very best service we possibly can.”

92

Through their defining moments, participants spoke o f taking ultimate responsibility for
their organizations and projects, and that this was crucial to their role as directors. For example,
one director decided to take responsibility to address an issue with the library board o f trustees
even if it meant losing her job. She stated, “In this case, I think it was honoring my role more
than I honored the security of myself in the position. And maybe I take m yself too seriously, but
that's me.” Another participant said,
So I think I stepped up to this role o f not just being a conscious person but
being far more focused on performance. I think the role o f leadership
ultimately is this assumption o f responsibility. If you are paid to be the
director then you are supposed to get something to happen. You are supposed
to institute change in a positive direction. So I think that the value that I got
out o f that experience was the sense that I really am responsible for these
values. It’s not enough to know them; I have to live them. ... I think that the
primary responsibility o f library leaders is that you are making things better
for your community, stakeholders o f the institution.
In addition, one participant spoke of the result o f a defining moment in this way,
Suddenly I realized that I had to look at my job from the point o f view o f all
the other people whose jobs were dependent on how well I did mine. And that
was what happened. I realized that my responsibility here was bigger than I
had imagined, and it mattered a lot in the everyday lives o f a lot o f other
people in ways that I just hadn’t counted on and hadn’t thought about, and
that’s what did it for me.

93

Similarly, another participant summed up how her role as library director has impacted her
values in this way,
I take very seriously the fact that I am in this position to impact people's lives,
my staff and people in the community, in both positive and negative ways;
and that's very real for me, and I think about that all the time. ... There is an
enormous responsibility that comes with being in a leadership role, and it is
around being accountable, all those things that we have talked about. ... And I
think you have to remember that every day when you are in that position of
exercising leadership, that it's not just about power and authority, it is about
responsibility and accountability.
Intentionality of Values
As indicated above, many participants stated that they consider their values in their
everyday work. The two urban library directors with over 400 employees dispersed throughout
their cities, emphasized the importance o f articulating core values at work, modeling them, and
holding employees accountable for those values. One stated that the shift from directing smaller
library systems to becoming the managerial leader o f a very large one was a challenge. He had
thought that he could manage and lead the way he had in smaller library systems, but the size of
the staff and dispersed nature o f the larger library system compelled him to develop clear values
priorities for the organization and expectations o f all staff. This values-based leadership was
designed to align a large group o f library personnel to achieve consistently excellent and
effective service to the community.
Another participant stated that the shift to becoming the director was what prompted her
to become more aware o f her values and understand them more clearly. She explained, “I think it

94

has just made me attend to some [values] and maybe consciously realize why they are important.
... It is easier to see the impact o f your values when you are a public library director.” A third
director spoke o f consciously deciding which values to employ based on the circumstance. She
stated that often she reflects on “how to be aware o f your values and your feelings about your
values in a way that allows you to either suppress them on a particular project or adjust them so
that what you’re trying to achieve is the most important principle and guides what you’re doing.”
In other cases, three participants stated that they were not as consciously aware of their
values. One said,
I cannot say that I ’m quite that deliberate about it in my decision making
process. Now, since I’ve read these things and stuff, I have actually thought
about it a little more here in the last three weeks since w e’ve been talking and
I took the evaluation and you gave me the results back. It kind o f creeps
around on the outside edge, but it’s more just - I just decide. I can see how the
different values play into what I do, but it’s not as intentional.
Two other directors also spoke o f how being involved in this dissertation research helped them to
be more conscious o f their values. They had previously acted without awareness or reflection
about their core values.
Whether intentionally applied, or unconsciously motivated, all participants stated that
values are integral to the way they think, make decisions, and lead their organizations. While
each interview included specifics o f how values, such as integrity and respect informed library
services and interactions, several participants also spoke o f deeper motivational values for why
they specifically chose the library profession. For example, one participant stated, “I feel like the
world is getting less and less equitable, and that the library has a real opportunity to impact that

95

and, I would argue, responsibility to try to impact that. And that is a real primary core value for
me.” Another said,
I work in libraries because I believe they change people’s lives. And that
everything we do is directed towards that overall goal o f making libraries an
essential part o f people’s ability to live, to prosper, to grow intellectually, and
to be in a better place than they would be if we didn’t have them. So that’s just
kind o f an underlying value, and I think I have to, you know, sometimes we
lose sight o f it, and we all tend to get really busy and lose sight o f the “why”
part o f what w e’re doing; b u t... stepping back periodically and saying why
and being able to say that in a way that propels us forward is really important.
While these interviews illuminated how values inform the specific work o f public library
directors, it is clear that some directors apply values consciously and with intention. Others
recognized in hindsight that they made decisions and behaved in their work based on their core
values. A few participants expressed the importance o f acting mindfully in their work in order to
be aware of the complex interplay o f people and values, and they behave with self-regulation
when necessary. This additional focus on awareness is a theme that will be returned to in
subsequent chapters.
Values Formation
Participants discussed how the values that most influence their work were developed. In
discussing values formation, a few stated that they do not remember a time when they did not
have the specific core values they employ. In the majority o f interviews, the participants stated
that their values were instilled from a young age by parents, grandparents, siblings, and other
family influences. One said, “I would definitely say that the values that I hold ... [and] I live by

96

are the ones that I was raised with.” Another explained a value that came from her mother by
stating, “I had an amazing mother who was always curious, always learning, but, yet, really
accepting o f people.” A third participant explained, “One o f my grandfathers, who was an
immigrant from Italy, came here as a young man, had an eighth-grade education but loved to
read. [He] became a very successful businessman; but he was also a citizen o f the world ... He
had a huge influence on me.”
A fourth participant explained,
I grew up being taught to be responsible for my actions, that there’s nothing
you do that doesn’t impact on someone else somehow. ... I don’t remember
not having that explicit in my childhood. And the people around me, my
parents and my grandparents, they live that way. So it was acted out in front
o f me and I saw it happening and that’s where it came from. It was just always
was there as an expectation. So it’s who I am, and that’s why I am that way.
Most participants spoke o f family members from childhood who instilled positive values.
Two participants indicated that their husbands had significant influence on the values they
possess, such as taking risks and being courageous in making necessary changes personally and
professionally.
Some participants also discussed library-related influences on their values. One spoke o f
having a traumatic experience in youth and finding understanding and resolution through using
the public library. This experience instilled the value that the library should be available to and
accepting o f all inquiries. Three spoke o f books that were early influences on their values. For
example, one spoke o f comic books and television shows this way, “We had Batman, Superman,
[and] Spiderman, and these are all people who tried to help people and who always tried to do

97

the right thing.” This influences her belief that she needs to conduct herself in ways that have
positive impacts on people’s lives. Two other participants spoke o f books that were influential in
their values development when they were young adults by making them more accepting and
tolerant o f those different from themselves.
Participants also told stories o f mentors in the profession or colleagues in other
professions who helped them gain confidence in their values and clarity about how they should
use values in their work. Other influences were discussed including three directors who
mentioned that growing up in the 1960s influenced them to prioritize tolerance and equitability.
Two participants talked about experiences running businesses as influencing how they manage
libraries. They described the management o f the library as similar to running a small business in
terms o f the fiscal and reporting responsibilities. Overall, the values that most influence
respondents’ work were formed in youth and continue to be strengthened through library work
experiences.
Leadership
Study participants discussed how they define leadership. Some directors gave short
definitions, and others provided a long list o f what leadership means to them. The director o f the
smallest library stated, “Leadership is being connected with those that you are so-called leading
and setting an example. Lead by example.” She clarified that she did not feel like she was in
charge but rather was o f service to those she was leading. Four discussed leadership as setting an
example or modeling the behaviors they want to see in others. In fact, all but one participant
spoke o f the importance o f engaging with followers in some way, including connecting with
staff, supporting and empowering them, and inspiring them to action.

98

Six directors spoke o f the importance o f having a vision or clear direction and being able
to articulate that to others. One stated,

there’s two sides to [leadership]. There’s one o f

knowing where you’re going, and the other part is being able to get people to go with you.”
Four participants discussed the leader’s role in being responsible to the organization and
the community in ways that improve community life and produce quality results. One also
pointed out the role o f the leader in resolving issues when conflicts arise. She stated, “ ... taking
responsibility for the organization, so when something goes wrong that everybody in the group
knows that they just need to call me or get me out o f whatever I am doing. I’m the one that is
supposed to fight for things; that responsibility is not on them.”
Two participants discussed the need for the leader to be decisive; another two pointed out
the importance o f being curious or open-minded, and two participants discussed the importance
o f timing, such as knowing when to move forward urgently and when to hold back. In addition,
some participants identified other aspects o f leadership, these being striving for excellence, being
self-aware, respectful, confident, innovative, and visible. One director stated that her leadership
is situational and responsive to the environment and the needs o f followers in context.
In defining leadership, the overarching themes o f supporting followers, having a vision,
and being responsible for results were most apparent. One participant provided this pithy
definition, “It is really about inspiring a group o f people to do great things together.” Whether
brief or expansive, the descriptions of leadership covered a variety o f themes, indicating that the
participants had differing styles o f leadership. However, in all cases, the participants discussed
how values informed their work as a leader and pointed out how their role as a library director
changed their values priorities. Values play a complex role for library directors regardless o f the
size o f the library and other variables.

99

Conclusion
Through this investigation o f public library directors’ values, using a questionnaire and
an interview, several themes emerged among the participants regardless o f size o f library and
other personal variables, such as educational background and length o f time as a director.
Whether using values consciously or unconsciously in their work, all participants, upon
reflection, identified core values and discussed how these inform their work. Stories o f defining
moments differed based on the size o f library and director’s role. For example, one library
director working in a small town told stories related to direct service to the public and directors
o f larger library systems described situations with complex, multi-library organizational change.
Most directors spoke of the need for accountability in their positions. Five respondents discussed
that they are personally equated with the library in the community, and take this role seriously.
They chose self-regulation, at times, to maintain a positive public persona. They spoke about
paying attention and one participant spoke of the importance o f mindfulness in the moment to
choose wisely.
Participants have common professional values and share a deep commitment to
encouraging independent inquiry, inspiring learning, ensuring access for all, and defending
intellectual freedom. These values, as well as other common values, such as honesty, integrity,
respect, and loyalty, will be discussed in more detail in chapter three.
In addition to descriptions of how childhood values were instilled at a deeper level
through library work experience, some participants also described values conflicts in which they
had to make difficult choices in prioritizing values. These two types o f values responses will be
explored in more depth in the next chapter.

100

The participants expressed appreciation for being selected for this dissertation research
and commented on the benefits o f being involved. As noted above, four are nearing retirement
and stated that they welcomed the opportunity to reflect more deeply on their values and find
more meaning in their careers. One participant said that being in the study helped her to look
back at her career with a different lens, to assess her accomplishments, and to understand her
deeper motivations. In another case, the director was in the midst o f a defining moment and
appreciated the values report and questions because they illuminated her understanding o f her
priorities and gave her the confidence to proceed in resolving a values conflict in her library. A
fourth participant said that, reflecting on his values, defining moments, and the interview
transcript allowed him to see deeper patterns about his own values development thereby aiding
him in understanding his motivations and convictions.
Some participants stated that their values are so ingrained that they do not think o f them
on a daily basis; however, others are intentional about using values in their everyday work. Two
in the latter group o f participants said that they were eager to see the results o f the study, stating
that they believed so strongly in the importance o f values that they not only wanted to be in the
study, but also believed values in libraries need more research and emphasis with their peers.
The conversations required the participants to share stories and beliefs about values that a
few participants indicated to be uncomfortable. One participant wrote on the values
questionnaire, “This question made me uncomfortable.” He later described how the process had
opened his eyes to some o f his values priorities in ways he had not anticipated. During the
interview, another participant said, “This is actually a really unnerving process now that I have
actually done it with you. It makes me feel a little naked, but I think it was also valuable for me,
so thank you.” The investigator was sensitive to these issues and took precautions to ensure each

101

director was clear about the various aspects o f participation and aware they could leave the study
at any time.
Because values are so deeply held, defining moments allowed the participants to reflect
and gain new insight on their values. Their stories include lessons in which they either
recommitted to or changed values. These processes o f defining moments, described in the
literature review, will be explored in more depth in chapter four.
Finally, a value the participants identified frequently was responsibility. While
professional values, such as intellectual freedom and interpersonal values, such as honesty and
respect could be shared by any person who may work in a library, the statements about
responsibility were described specifically with regard to the role as the public library director.
Several aspects o f managerial leadership emerged as themes including the responsibility to be
accountable to several stakeholders including governing authorities, community members, and
personnel, which is the subject o f chapter five.

CHAPTER THREE
COMMON THEMES AMONG CORE VALUES

Personal values fundamentally inform how individuals perceive the world, make
decisions, and behave. This process can occur with conscious intention, such as when one
purposely chooses a direction for an organization based on core values; or subconsciously, when
an individual is motivated by values at a subconscious level o f awareness. In this study, some
participants stated that they used their values purposefully, and others said they became more
aware of their values priorities through their participation in this research. In either case, all
participants stated that understanding values is important, particularly as an organizational
leader.
In the library profession, studies have sought to ascertain the personal values o f librarians
(Bryan, 1952; Douglass, 1957; Igwe, 1981; Yerkey, 1980) as well as to determine their
professional values priorities (Burd, 2003; Dole, Hurych, & Koehler, 2000; Foster &
McMenemy, 2012; Hovenkamp, 1994), yet this is the first inquiry to employ the internationally
tested and validated PVQIV. The instrument, which illuminates common values among the 12
study participants, are discussed in this chapter. Initially, this chapter describes participants’
responses to the experience o f taking the test and the results o f the test, which provides insight
into the value o f the instrument for further use with librarians. Then, the top three motivational
values identified through the PVQIV are compared with the professional literature on values in
librarianship to determine values priorities that may be held more broadly than by the study
participants.

104

Although identifying values using the PVQIV was informative, the instrument has
limited ability to provide insight into how values are formed, developed, and used by public
library directors. This study also used narrative inquiry to probe the specific development and
use o f values in public library directors’ work. The interviews produced common themes among
participants related to core values, conflicts between competing values, and ways in which
values were either instilled or reprioritized through work experiences. This chapter delves into
participant experiences and uses a figure (3.1) to consider values at multiple levels o f
intrapersonal (self), interpersonal, organizational, community-level, and broader societal
application. This multi-level figure aids in illustrating how values may be developed and
instilled for different purposes and in various environments.
Participants and PVQIV Results
Study participants responded to the results o f the PVQIV with varying degrees o f interest.
Those who indicated that they tend not to think consciously about their values used the PVQIV
report and language as a guide to describing their defining moments and core values in the study.
For example, one participant said, “I was looking under universalism, you know, understanding,
appreciation, tolerance, protection for the welfare o f people and nature; I didn’t have these words
for these things before, but I’m taking this [test] and getting this chart in front o f me, being able
to apply, well, I guess that’s where that comes from or why I feel this way.” Another director
stated,
When I read through these - the things you’ve got listed here - and I think
about them in terms o f decision making ... I can absolutely see m yself in
these things and where I scored. But I don’t know that I’m quite that

105

deliberate about them as far as being able to say, when I made this decision it
was really based on benevolence and universalism.
These participants indicated they were less consciously aware o f their values and how to
articulate them prior to the interview. The process o f reflecting on the values report and
interview questions ahead o f the interview prepared them to discuss values in the narrative
inquiry process.
In other cases, directors were clear about their values and considered the results o f the
test to be accurate. One participant stated, “I looked at my report and I laughed out loud because
I don’t remember not being that girl.” Another participant said, “[The values report] did really
identify the things that were important to me. When I looked at it, I just thought, this is so
accurate.” In these cases, the participants found the test accurately reported their values.
Although some found the test results to be helpful in identifying and discussing their
values, a few were critical o f the test, particularly those who stated that they use their values
intentionally in their work. One stated,
I don’t know if I found anything in it that was illuminating for me. Looking at
it now, I think that universalism was supposed to be my big defining goal,
understanding, appreciation, okay, maybe so. Stimulation is a defining goal,
excitement and challenge in life, well maybe, curiosity, self-direction maybe.
It is not that I so much disagree with them, but none o f these particular words
tend to be the language that I use.
As with this participant, a few others were skeptical, as they are o f any test that categorizes
people based on types. They were dismissive o f the notion that a standardized test could identify
something as personal as core values.

106

While the top values among all study respondents identified by the PVQIV seemed to
resonate for all participants, some directors discussed values ranked in fourth, fifth, or sixth place
that did not align with their own understanding o f themselves and their priorities. One participant
said, “The one that surprised me a little bit was conformity. I’m not one to think that I’m more of
a conformist. I guess I don’t really like that word. I guess I don’t really like labels in general.” A
few other participants also stated that some o f the lesser values that ranked either above or below
their mean may not have been an accurate depiction o f them. One participant stated, “I was
surprised that achievement is that low.” She also said,
It’s the way I view m yself except for the power one. That bothered me that
that [value] would be fourth on the list. I want people to do what I want them
to do. I admit that. But the social status and prestige and social power and
wealth and preserving public image don’t fit. And power sounds like I’m
ambitious for myself. But I am pretty— quite a mother hen with my library.
And I can say that I want all those things for the library.
Upon further probing, this participant stated that, although her results indicate that the value of
power was higher than other values, she is not as ambitious for herself but for the organization
and results on the community. These observations may indicate that Schwartz’s (2012)
conclusion that power is related to self-enhancement rather than societal enhancement may not
always apply. As in this case, in a work setting, an individual may prioritize power to advance
initiatives that are in the interest o f organizational stakeholders, such as employees, customers,
the community, and/or society rather than self.
This distinction o f motivation to benefit the library rather than self-benefit could relate to
how the instrument portrays each value. Two statements describe a value and a motivation in

107

ways that some participants found contradictory in particular statement sets. One participant
explained,
I actually found them difficult to answer. Because in about seven or eight o f
the examples, I really felt the two short sentences [of each portrait] were two
very different things; and I wasn’t sure which one to lead with. I will give you
an example: number 13 says, “Being very successful is important to him. He
likes to impress other people.” It is very important for me to be successful, but
I have little interest in impressing other people.
In this case, the participant explained that success relates to how well the library serves
community needs. The secondary aspect o f impressing others does not apply. This observation
that may indicate a weakness in the instrument in that some participants may not know which
part o f the portrait to relate to or that the portrait has conflicting aspects that may compromise
the reliability o f the results.
Because the questionnaire is based on personal values, inconsistencies may arise when
applying the instrument within the work context because, at times, personal values do not align
specifically with the way an individual performs at work. One participant observed that selecting
how much she was like another person was challenging and potentially could be misleading
because she might choose one answer when considering the statements from a personal
perspective, but choose differently when considering them in the context o f her work as a library
director.
In some cases, the core values used in work are prioritized differently than in personal
lives. For example, in the area o f self-direction versus conformity, two directors explained that,
although each tends to be self-directed and independent-minded in the role o f public library

108

director, they also tend to regulate their behavior or conform to the norms o f the town in order to
positively represent the library. One potentially valuable modification to the PVQIV would be a
series o f values portraits that overtly relates to one’s professional role and organizational
aspirations.
Although the PVQIV has limitations, the instrument engaged participants in reflecting on
and discussing their values. The results in this study, particularly regarding the top three values,
were accurate as confirmed by participants, as will be discussed later in this chapter, In addition,
the top three values identified also align with the prioritized values o f the library profession.
PVQIV and Library Professional Values
The study participants, having taken the Schwartz PVQIV questionnaire, scored highest
overall in the areas of self-direction, benevolence, and universalism. Schwartz (1996, 2003,
2012) states that self-direction indicates an openness to change accompanied by goals o f seeking
independence with thoughts, choices, and actions. Single values associated with self-direction
include curiosity, exploration, learning, creativity, and freedom. Benevolence and universalism
are aligned with societal enhancement rather than self-enhancement. Benevolence has the
defining goal o f seeking to enhance the welfare o f family, friends, and/or community members,
encompassing single values, such as being helpful, kind, honest, and loyal. Universalism is more
broadly focused on the goal o f welfare o f all humanity and nature with single values, such as
equality, wisdom, social justice, and broad-mindedness.
In many ways, these values as defined by Schwartz (1996, 2003, 2012) align with top
professional values among librarians as identified by previous studies (Burd, 2003; Dole,
Hurych, & Koehler, 2000; Foster & McMenemy, 2012). In each o f these values studies, the top
ranked professional value was service, which Gorman (2000) defines both as directly assisting

109

individuals who use the library and, through cumulative service transactions, serving “society
and humanity as a whole” (p. 74). The focus on service to library users aligns with the concept
o f benevolence, and the broader focus on societal change relates more closely to universalism.
Library employees provide service to library users by aiding them in finding information
and books, by providing instruction to encourage them to think critically about information, and
by assisting them in learning or improving skills, such as reading. These services are performed,
in the best cases, with courtesy, respect, kindness, and helpfulness; values identified within the
broad category o f benevolence (Schwartz, 1996, 2003, 2012). In addition, the value o f selfdirection is inherent in these services because o f the focus on providing opportunities for users to
learn in ways that empower them to be independent thinkers and achieve their goals.
As with benevolence, universalism is a common value among the study participants and
is aligned widely with library professionals’ values and ethics. The value o f equality is framed by
Schwartz (2012) within the motivational value o f universalism, which includes understanding,
appreciating, tolerating, and protecting all people. Dole, Hurych, and Koehler (2012) and Foster
and McMenamy (2012) found that equity o f access to information is a high-priority value
internationally in the library profession. As discussed earlier, participants scored high on
universalism and spoke o f their interest in helping all people, including those different from
themselves. Kagan (2005) also asserts that library professionals have a responsibility that
extends beyond providing equity o f access to working to defend the rights o f those who are not
treated equally throughout the world. The Schwartz-identified value o f universalism, in this
context, can be considered as aligning with this social justice value o f the library profession.
Self-direction, as described by Schwartz (1996,2003, 2012), has the defining goal o f
independent thought and action, which includes both the ability and the freedom to choose,

110

create, and explore any information or idea. Schwartz (1996, 2003, 2012) further explains that
the overarching motivational value o f self-direction is fundamentally compelled by the human
drive for control, mastery, autonomy, and independence; it can manifest as seeking to be creative
and to be free to choose one’s goals and path to attain those goals, and as having a natural
curiosity and interest in learning and increasing one’s intelligence. Another aspect o f this value,
according to Schwartz, is a commitment to privacy with regard to these independent intellectual
endeavors. This description aligns with the library profession’s value o f intellectual freedom
(Gorman, 2000), which relates to the professional responsibilities to support and to defend free
and equal access to information for all people o f a community. Library professionals demonstrate
this value through services and activities that facilitate information-seeking, as well as by
supporting free speech, a basic right o f a democratic society, and one guaranteed by the First
Amendment o f the U.S. Constitution (Gorman, 2000). Intellectual freedom, as a core value o f the
library profession, includes both supporting and defending individuals in their independent
pursuit o f any and all information as well as ensuring the privacy o f all who seek knowledge.
Several elements are involved with this value including ensuring that library users can freely
seek and read information that they seek. Indeed self-direction, as described by Schwartz (1996,
2003, 2012), is aligned with the fundamental values o f the library profession as are the values of
service (benevolence), and access for all (universalism). In this study, participants indicate that
they hold the core value o f self-direction for themselves and for the interests o f those in their
communities.
Because this is the first study in the library profession that used the PVQIV instrument,
comparing results to other studies o f personal values in the library profession is limited. Personal
values studies using the Study o f Values (Bryan, 1952; Douglass, 1957; Igwe, 1981) found that

111

library professionals tend to overemphasize values that are theoretical (discovery o f truth and
cognition); aesthetic (form, beauty, and harmony); and social (love and altruism). These values
may overlap with Schwartz’s values designations (1996, 2003, 2012) in that his definition of
self-direction could overlap the theoretical in the area o f cognition; universalism includes some
aspects o f the aesthetic values related to beauty and harmony; and benevolence could be
interpreted as oriented toward the social values o f love and altruism. However, the alignment is
not direct and further comparisons require more research. In general, these top values, regardless
o f the theory and instrument, point to a profession that prioritizes social and community focus;
an appreciation o f intellectual pursuits; and a vision for a better world with more equality,
knowledge, and peace.
Perhaps more instructive is comparing the 20th century studies o f the personal values of
librarians (Bryan, 1952; Douglass, 1957; Igwe, 1981), and this study’s results o f the lowest
prioritized values. The studies all found an under-emphasis on economic and political values
among library professionals; as defined by Allport, Vernon, and Lindzey (1970), economic
values relate to self-preservation and political values relate to power, influence, and renown.
These values align most with Schwartz’s (2012) definition o f the value he terms power, a self­
enhancing goal to attain social status, prestige, control, wealth, authority, preservation o f image,
and dominance. In this study, the participants cumulatively rated power low, which indicates that
this value may be a lower personal priority for library managers generally.
Although standardized tests have merit for identifying personal values commonly held by
librarians, this study’s individual values reports and interviews identified that some directors
prioritize power, and achievement, not for themselves, but for the successful operation, funding,
and quality o f libraries services. Therefore, while directors might not personally seek power and

112

prestige, some may aspire to attain money, influence, and power for the benefit o f their libraries.
The distinction between personal values and values prioritized in work is a theme that emerged
repeatedly through narrative inquiry.
Values Identification through Narrative Inquiry
Further probing of the efficacy o f the Schwartz (2012) motivational values through the
narrative inquiry process helped to delineate and clarify common values within the broader
motivational values that Schwartz identifies. For example, instead o f referring to benevolence,
the participants used the specific words, being responsible, honest, loyal, respectful, and serviceoriented to identify what is most important in their work. In some cases, they used the term
benevolence because it was used in the values report, but they specifically discussed the more
focused values (e.g., honesty, respect, responsibility, and loyalty), when describing their work
activities and motivations. When participants spoke o f service, some communicated the need to
have a welcoming library for community members; however, most defined service as having the
deeper significance o f enabling intellectual pursuits and life-changing transactions. In this
context, service was described not necessarily as an end but as a means to the more salient value
o f supporting learning and literacy.
Gorman (2000) defines fostering literacy and learning as having three elements:
“encouraging literacy and the love o f learning; encouraging lifelong sustained reading; [and]
making the library a focus o f literacy teaching” (p. 27). In previous studies (Dole, Hurych, &
Koehler, 2012; Foster & McMenamy, 2012), participants viewed service as more important than
literacy and learning. Whereas in this study, participants described service as encouraging a love
o f learning and the other aspects o f Gorman’s description o f literacy and learning. Rather than
focusing on the act o f reading itself, as Gorman (2000) suggests, study participants spoke o f how

113

reading empowers library users to learn and improve their lives. Participants explained the
fundamental purpose o f library service in several complex ways. One stated, “W e’re not about
benevolence in the welfare state type o f way. W e’re about letting people find their own
experiences.” Another said, one element that drives the services in the library stems from his
childhood experience in which he determined that library service is “not just honoring curiosity,
but the blatant encouragement o f it, and to aid and abet the curiosity o f young minds.” A third
library director expressed the importance o f the library service philosophy including the
statement, “We are dedicated and passionate about changing people’s lives.” Similarly, another
library director said, “Everything we do is directed toward that overall goal o f making libraries
an essential part o f people’s ability to live, to prosper, to grow intellectually, and to be in a better
place than they would be if we didn’t have them.” These statements indicate library services that
are focused more on transformational experiences than on the mere transactional service o f
providing services, such as friendly and efficient access to books or promoting reading for the
sake o f reading.
In addition to having aspirational goals that library service will encourage curiosity and
change lives through intellectual development, on a practical daily basis, one participant said,
“I have a quote in our workroom of Henry David Thoreau that says, ‘To affect the quality o f the
day; that is the highest o f arts.’ And that’s what we all try to do, is affect, positively affect, the
quality o f the day for anybody that comes in the library.” Such statements about service expand
the definition and indicate a deeper professional commitment to individual learning and
discovery that will improve patrons’ quality o f life in the short term and, potentially, have a
lasting intellectual impact on their lives.

114

Certainly, the professional values identified by Gorman (2000), such as service and
literacy and learning, seem to overlap in practice; this points to the importance o f probing more
deeply to understand the fundamental motivations behind library work. Within the motivational
value o f universalism, participants in this study articulated the core values o f understanding,
appreciation, and tolerance for those who are different from them, and encouraging that tolerance
in others. Participants shared a strong commitment to equality o f access, and, in some cases,
social justice. Many participants spoke o f the importance o f being broad-minded in terms of
meeting the needs o f diverse populations as well as in providing access to a wide variety o f
information. This orientation also aligns with the motivational value o f self-direction, although
they spoke of the interest in thinking and acting independently as important for others as well as
themselves.
Some participants told stories o f reaching out to socioeconomically underprivileged
patrons and stated that providing access and services to this population is critical to the library’s
mission. While discussing the values they most use in their work and the formation o f those
values, participants described personal experiences o f reaching out to immigrants, low-income
populations, children in poverty, and diverse populations in order to provide library services to
those most in need o f support. This orientation toward assisting all residents who need support is
a distinct aspect o f the overarching value o f universalism, which targets the specific values o f
broad-mindedness, equality, and social justice. Participants stated that all users should have the
same access to information and ideas that satisfy their curiosity and creative interests, and
empower them to improve their lives. In other words, the participants spoke o f library services in
ways that integrate various aspects of Schwartz’s (2012) values o f self-direction, benevolence,

115

and universalism within the context of intellectual freedom, learning and literacy, and equal
access to all information for all people.
Considering the wide range o f experiences and education o f the study participants, it is
worth noting that each spoke o f these values in similar ways. This indicates that individuals with
deep commitments to these specific values may be drawn to the library profession. It is
interesting to note that the experiences associated with being the library director affirms these
values on multiple levels, and that these experiences may be the key to refining profession values
over time.
Values Distinct to the Role of Public Library Director
Participants identified and discussed their values in various contexts, including how their
values priorities may have changed because o f their roles as library directors. In addition to
articulating shared professional values, which may be common to many in the profession, these
individuals also discussed additional values priorities that related specifically to their roles as
public library directors. As with other studies (Hemon, Powell, & Young, 2013; Jordan, 2012),
this study found that these public library directors give high priority to honesty and integrity.
Badaracco and Ellsworth (1989), in their research on business leaders, concluded that integrity
suggests wholeness and coherence between what organizational leaders believe, how they
manage, and the kind o f organization they aspire to build. In this description integrity is a
consistency o f personal values, daily work behavior, and organizational focus.
Jordan (2012) defines integrity in public library directorship as synonymous with
honesty, which involves consistently following the professions’ code o f ethics and being a role
model for others. Her study discusses accountability and credibility as separate attributes.
However, in this study the directors discussed honesty, integrity, transparency, and

116

accountability as conceptually linked, indicating that, although honesty may be a personal value,
directors may demonstrate honesty through consistent and cohesive words and behaviors
(integrity), open reporting practices (transparency), and rigorous evaluation and reporting
(accountability). Participants discussed these interrelated values o f honesty, integrity,
accountability, and transparency at various levels throughout their organizations and in their
communities. When these values are established and maintained, a sense o f credibility and trust
is developed within the organization (Covey & Merrill, 2006) and within the community (Bundt,
2000 ).
Although participants highlighted the importance o f integrity, their motivation for
prioritizing this value was a commitment to their personal values and aspirations for the
institutions, the personnel, and the communities they serve. They emphasized that they felt
responsible, as the organizational leaders, to be honest, consistent, and accountable. Participants
discussed integrity in multiple circumstances, including resolving performance issues, striving
for excellence, modeling the behaviors they want their employees to exhibit, conducting
themselves in a manner that represents the library positively in the community, and being
accountable to taxpayers. In summary, integrity was a major theme, yet the overarching concept
of responsible organizational leadership motivated them to commit to integrity, respect, selfdiscipline, and other personal values that also function at the leadership and organizational
levels.
Values in the Organization
Some values theorists distinguish between values types within the professional setting.
For example, Dolan and Raich (2013) identified a triad model o f values in organizational culture
in which economic values relate to efficiency, economic performance, and other pragmatic

117

operational standards; social values (e.g., honesty, respect, and loyalty) relate to interactions
among stakeholder groups; and emotional and spiritual values are intrinsically motivated
dispositions (e.g., optimism, passion, freedom, and happiness). Carter and Greer (2013) discuss
the triple bottom line in which organizational values relate to three areas o f performance:
financial, social, and environmental. Financial values refer to maximizing profits, whereas social
values encompass internal benefits, such as employee health, and external foci, such as
community vitality. The third area of environmental values relates to natural resources used,
greenhouse gases emitted, and other measures o f environmental impact, which fall into the
general category of socially responsible values.
Within the literature o f library and information science, Finks (1989) classifies four sets
o f values in librarianship: professional, general, personal, and rival. He describes professional
values as the specific library values o f service, stewardship, love o f wisdom and truth,
democracy, and love o f reading and books. The general work values are aspirations held in
common with other professions (e.g., competence and excellence), social values (e.g., respect
and courtesy), or values related to work satisfaction (e.g., self-respect and self-actualization).
Finks’ (1989) third category is personal values, which he defines as those most librarians
uniquely share in common; these are idealistic and humanistic aspirations for society, such as
excellence, beauty, and truth. The final category is rival values, which Finks warns are
detrimental to the profession; these include bureaucracy, anti-intellectualism, and nihilism.
While these distinctions are o f interest, in this study, participants did not speak o f values from a
framework in which they separated professional, operational, personal, and aspirational values.
When they spoke, for example, o f honesty or respect, they identified the value as important
within the work environment regardless o f whether it was with a staff member, a reporting

118

authority, or the community at large. For this reason, while several schemata o f values exist to
distinguish values based on their type or functions within organizations, this study outlines
values, as the participants did, across the various environments in which they were applied and
discussed.
Theorists also posit how values are used in various work contexts. For example, Petter
(2005) describes four functional levels to organizational accountability: (1) internal compass of
personal values used for decisions and actions; (2) organizational drives in which a sense o f
obligation to a supervisor or the organization is present; (3) external conditions in which
stakeholders outside o f the organization have expectations; and (4) societal obligations, including
public and legal requirements. These levels of accountability establish a sense o f responsibility
across an organization. Similarly, Voegtlin, Patzer, and Scherer (2012) describe three contexts
for organizational accountability: the micro level, involving personal interactions; the meso
level, relating to organizational performance; and the macro level, concerning external
stakeholders. However, this structure leaves out intrapersonal (related to the self) aspects o f
values while distinguishing internal and external organizational accountability. Further, Carter
and Greer (2013) describe five levels that motivate work: (1) transaction-basic service; (2) selfbenefit; (3) organizational value; (4) outside stakeholder priorities; and (5) societal improvement.
These levels indicate how values motivate and are used in organizations, and align with the ways
in which study participants described personal values in their work.
Based on the interviews with participants in this study, public library directors’ values
operate within five distinct contexts: intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community,
and societal. Figure 3.1 provides a visual representation o f the contexts in which study
participants described employing core values.

119

Figure 3.1

Interpersonal

Intrapersonal

In the intrapersonal environment the individual is self-motivated to live by their values
and self-reflective throughout this process. These values are formed and changed over time and
are considered to be core, enduring but changeable. Interpersonal contexts include interactions
with one or a few people within the institution, including employees, trustees, or reporting
authorities; or with those outside the institution, including individuals who use the library or
stakeholders engaging in library-related activities, such as volunteers, donors, and community
leaders.
In an organizational context, values can impact a few people in small libraries or a large
number o f employees in libraries serving multiple neighborhoods. The organizational application
o f values relates to how the work is accomplished and how the organization operates. Employees
120

are expected to give high priority to organizational values and consistently use them for
congruent and consistent operations. In organizational contexts, values relate to effective
operations, policies, accountability measures, and related organizational structures.
Directors’ values also influence the broader community served by the library, including
special interest groups, specific demographic groups, such as children and seniors, specific
ethnic populations, and those engaged in a variety o f community-level activities. The broadest
frame for values employment o f public library directors is societal and includes library
professional associations, broader organizations, and stakeholders beyond the specific
community the library serves.
Study participants described each o f these environments as contextual, in which specific
situations required individualized consideration o f how to prioritize and use values. They interact
daily within various interpersonal, organizational, community, and societal environments while
continuing to reflect on their own core values that inform their behaviors and priorities. Study
participants discussed defining moments that took place inside the institution, with staff or in
organizational circumstances, and with external constituencies, including individual library users
or other community stakeholders. While participants described these various contexts, the values
they depicted as core influenced their behaviors across these various environments. For instance,
directors whose core value was integrity indicated conducting themselves with integrity with
staff, the library board, and users, and within the community. The consistency o f demonstrating
that core value across environments confirms the notion that the personal value o f integrity led to
an integrated code o f conduct regardless o f the situation.
Instilled Values
In discussing defining moments, study participants described how events either instilled

core values or led them to reprioritize values. In the former case, several directors mentioned
values that were formed in their youth, such as respect, responsibility, and honesty, which they
saw in new ways and recommitted to at deeper levels in response to critical incidents. This
process o f instilling values is also reflected in figure 3.1, which starts with the value being held
at the intrapersonal level, applied interpersonally in communications with others, as well as at the
level o f the organization, and more broadly with the community and society.
For example, one director spoke o f responsibility as a core value that she has long held
having seen it modeled and reinforced by her family members throughout childhood. In a
defining moment as a director, she chose to hold a staff member to a level o f responsibility that
was consistent with the work o f everyone else in the library. It was clear that the person needed
to be fired. Faced with this personnel issue, options might include deferring the difficult
conversation to avoid the conflict with or harm to that employee. In this case, the participant
believed that confronting the staff issue was her responsibility, and others in the organization
were counting on her. She explained how she came to realize that the act o f firing him was her
responsibility, and following through instilled the value o f responsibility in her. Along with
accepting that responsibility was a core personal value, she had the insight that responsibility
now played a broader role in her work, including the responsibility to the rest o f the staff and the
standards of the organization as a whole. This moment was defining not only for her, but also
organizationally as other staff members learned that she had a standard level o f performance that
is necessary to ensure quality and excellence. This act also established responsibility as a core
value for the organization and those who work there. Further, she explained that the value of
responsibility also informs how she presents herself to her community, because she recognizes
that, as the library director, many people in the community consider her actions and words

122

representative o f the library. She takes that role seriously, and is conscientious about how she
conducts herself in community forums. This example illustrates how a public library director’s
personal value o f responsibility, over time is instilled throughout the library, and more broadly
within the community.
Reprioritized Values
In this study, some directors described defining moments involving values conflicts that
led them to change values priorities. These transitions were not temporary but, indeed, were
transformative in that the incidents and reprioritization became changes that persisted. The
values conflicts and the subsequent values reprioritization continue to be sources o f reflection
and consideration for the directors who discussed them. In some cases, while describing the
events, participants explained that they still reassess their choices even though they know in
hindsight that they took the right course.
The most common type o f reprioritization event involves participants feeling a sense o f
loyalty to a staff member, board member, or supervisor and then beginning to question that
loyalty due to the colleague’s behavior. The stories revealed the importance participants place on
relationships and the conflicts they experienced when subordinates behaved inappropriately. In
several cases, the person who directly reported to the participant was not performing in ways that
were required for the position. The participants described attempting to coach, mentor, and work
with the person to bring about change in performance and behavior. At the end o f each o f these
stories, the participants chose integrity, accountability, and/or organizational excellence over
loyalty to the subordinates. Whether in cases o f poor performance or in situations of
organizational change, participants prioritized fulfilling the mission o f the organization over
individuals working in the libraries. Study participants articulated a commitment to

123

organizational effectiveness, feel responsible to the community, and practice ethical behavior in
the workplace.
As participants spoke of these circumstances, each expressed strong emotion about the
difficulty o f withdrawing loyalty from these employees. The tone o f regret was clearly a
response to the choice o f employees who continued to behave inappropriately or who did not
change their behavior, rather than to the decisions the directors had to make. This conflict o f
loyalty for personnel was such a prevalent theme that it seems likely that other library managers
may struggle with similar values conflicts. Indeed, what made these defining for study
participants was the realization that their responsibilities to the organization and community are
more important than individual loyalties to employees who may be underperforming or
misbehaving.
Another type o f values conflict relates to disagreements between the directors and those
to whom they have reported. In one case, a conflict occurred with library board trustees who had
a traditional view o f the library’s role as solely focusing on books, while the director wanted to
expand library services through the use o f technology. In two other interviews, directors
disagreed with the decisions and techniques o f their superiors. In all o f these situations, the
director’s value of loyalty to the supervisor was in conflict with fundamental decisions about
library operations.
In one situation, the city manager was more conservative about managing change
whereas the director was interested in taking more risk. In addition, the city manager intended to
be autocratic, but the director wanted stakeholder input on the decision-making process. In each
o f these scenarios, the participants described their disagreement with the confidence that their
approaches were correct. At the same time, they could not persuade authority figures to agree to

124

their strategies. With little control over the decision-making method or results, one director chose
to leave her position in protest. In the second situation, the director decided to lead change as
required by the county manager in the short term and continue to persist over time until the
results aligned with her priorities. Similarly, in a third case, the library director waited patiently
until circumstances changed enough that the director’s method clearly became the prudent
choice. In the case o f the first director, she eventually returned to the library. The other directors
described ultimately achieving what they thought was best for the library, though this took a lot
longer than they would have preferred.
These cases are instructive in many ways. For example, study participants were definite
about their values and preferences and, in the stories they told, situations were eventually
resolved as the directors had initially intended. With regard to negotiating with supervisors, these
directors used timing, effective communication, and persistence ultimately to reach their goals.
The above examples relate to supervisory values conflicts, yet other participants provided
stories involving competing professional values. The most common professional values conflict
discussed in defining moments was the need to prioritize service over stewardship. Three
participants spoke o f changes they made to remove or bend rules in order to provide high quality
service. The rules were based on the need for the library to be a good steward o f its resources,
yet the directors described how those rules can, at times, get in the way o f providing quality
library service. Because the library profession prioritizes service over other values, it is not
surprising that participants insisted on providing quality service. Yet, several directors had
employees who were less motivated by providing service than by preserving the collections and
maintaining stewardship o f books.

125

Conclusion
Participants o f this study oversee public libraries that enjoy high community use, and
each spoke o f the importance o f this use, the quality o f interactions and services the library
offers, and the ways they conduct themselves with library personnel, patrons, and community
members. They share several common core values related to openness to change, curiosity, and
independent thinking (self-direction), and an interest in the welfare o f others (benevolence,
universalism), regardless of distinguishing factors, such as educational background, time in
profession, size of library (and community), and gender. This suggests that, while other elements
may contribute to effective leadership in public libraries, those who possess these core values
may prioritize service delivery in libraries that could lead to high community use in areas, such
as library visits, circulation, program attendance, and computer use. Participants reflected on
core values and described their meaning, speaking passionately about how libraries can impact
community members simply by improving a person’s day or by changing a life. The aspirational
belief that libraries change lives is an underlying theme o f all study participants’ responses.
Along with the visionary value o f life transformation, participants also spoke o f deeply
held values that they apply in their everyday work, such as honesty and integrity, respect, and
responsibility. They take their roles as library director seriously and articulate, model, and embed
values in their work at various levels o f engagement, including applying them in interactions at
the interpersonal, organizational, and community levels. Participants spoke o f the awareness that
their position requires them to be responsible; this includes having self-discipline, mindfulness,
and an interest in continuing to learn, and being able to adapt to changing environments.
In the stories o f defining moments that dealt with conflict, participants were emboldened
because they felt so strongly about their core values and were not willing to compromise. They

126

spoke o f finding courage in times o f conflict, bolstered by core values, which allowed them to
face and resolve difficult situations. Perhaps daily, public library directors face conflicts, but
what made the events described defining moments for the participants was an understanding and
confidence about what mattered to them. This sense o f purpose gave them confidence and further
commitment to the specific core value tested by the event.
Chapter four explores the elements o f defining moments in more detail to determine how
values are shaped through these significant life events. Although the participants have different
backgrounds, the common elements in defining moments are examined to understand how public
library directors face critical incidents and find ways to grow and improve library services and
operations.

CHAPTER FOUR
ANATOMY OF DEFINING MOMENTS:
FROM CRITICAL INCIDENT TO COMMITMENT

Previous research on defining moments in organizational leadership (Avolio & Luthans,
2006; Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007; M ackoff & Wenet, 2001) offers a framework for analyzing
study findings. For this study, this framework suggests that individuals can identify a moment o f
meaning (M ackoff & Wenet, 2001), a singular life instant that sustains greater importance than
others in life, creating new meaning and clarifying self-perception. Further, these defining
moments occur within a broader context comprised o f a series o f events, reflections, insights,
decisions, and commitments that transpire over time (Avolio & Luthans, 2006). This chapter
delves into the component parts o f defining moments as described by study participants and
analyzes the anatomy o f these defining moments in order to confirm findings from other studies
as well as offer new perspectives on these complex and meaningful human experiences. The
ultimate purpose of this examination is to clarify how core values function in the work lives o f
public library directors and how these experiences contribute to the organization.
Critical Incidents
Defining moments are sparked by critical life events, unexpected incidents, or
challenging situation (positive or negative) that do not fit within the individual’s current
knowledge base or life experience (Avolio & Luthans, 2006; Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007;
Cope & Watts, 2000; De Long, 2012). Cope and Watts (2000) describe critical incidents of
business owners as challenging situations that result in shifts in perception, awareness, and
understanding. They state that these critical incidents are singularly compelling to investigate

131

because o f the resulting transformational change, and presumed substantial improvement, both
personally with the organizational leader and within the organization.
In describing critical incidents, Avolio and Luthans (2006) identify three types that can
prompt defining moments: triggers in which a life event prompts an individual to reflect on his
or her sense o f self and identity; jo lts in which an unanticipated crisis, tragedy, or extraordinary
positive experience leads an individual to change beliefs and values; and challenging dilemmas,
either self-imposed or thrust upon an individual, which require reflection and reorientation.
These descriptions apply to the various stories told by study participants and are discussed in this
chapter.
In the literature o f library and information science, De Long (2012), who studied of
Canadian women deans of academic libraries, found that their critical incidents primarily related
to job changes and subordinate staff performance problems. Similarly, 54% o f defining moment
stories told by the 12 study participants occurred when they were new to managerial leadership
positions. Also in parallel with De Long’s findings, participants told seven stories (29%) of
critical incidents involving personnel issues. In addition, two participants described unexpected
critical incidents o f intellectual freedom challenges, three described critical incidents o f the
responsibility o f overseeing library building projects, and an additional three had to resolve
issues involving previous directors. This variety o f critical incidents indicates both a
commonality with other types o f organizations (building projects, customer service issues, and
response to natural disasters), as well as specific challenges that may require specialized training
and support for public library directors (resolving intellectual freedom issues and navigating
previous director issues).

132

General Responses to Critical Incidents
In response to critical incidents, individuals reflect and discover new understanding and
meaning in order to resolve situations (Badaracco, 1997). In some cases, these incidents prompt
defining moments in which core value are tested, clarified, and either instilled in a broader
context or reprioritized for the future (Badaracco, 1997; Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007). In this
study, participants described both instilled values and reprioritized values based on the context
and specific experiences.
Defining moments are a complex series o f events, reflections, insights, decisions, and
commitments that transpire over time (Avolio & Luthans, 2006). M ackoff and Wenet (2001)
assert that individuals respond to critical incidents in three phases: (1) reflection that leads to
discovery o f new meaning and new perception, (2) prioritization o f values that instills a sense o f
purpose, and (3) feelings o f confidence and self-efficacy for future situations. Although these
descriptions o f the responses to critical incidents illustrate the general stages o f defining
moments, study participants described three distinctly different responses to critical incidents: (1)
a prompt and surprising moment o f clarity; (2) a dilemma that requires extensive reflection over
months or years prior to an insight; and (3) delayed action due to complex relational conflict and
the need to coach or negotiate. Within each o f these responses, the components o f reflection,
insight, action, confidence, and commitment occur; however, the path to resolution varied.
Figure 4.1 depicts the flow o f each path o f defining moments described by participants.

Moments of Clarity
Moments o f clarity occurred when participants faced critical incidents and made a prompt
decision, such as the director who confronted a belligerent patron and insisted on respect in
library interactions. The response was prompt, unexpectedly strong, and initiated by a deep
commitment to respectful interactions. These moments o f clarity happen swiftly, and often it was
not until much later that the participants reflected consciously on the importance o f the
experience. Upon reflection, participants explained how their strong reaction and later

134

understanding o f a core value resulted in new understanding and commitment to the value that
extended from a personal value to become a work and organizational-level value. This study’s
stories o f moments of clarity could also be thought o f as triggers or jolts (Avolio & Luthans,
2006), in that they are unexpected experiences that require prompt action and clarify values
priorities and self-perception.
In this study, stories illustrate the path o f moments o f clarity, including a participant who
transitioned from being an employee to becoming the director o f the library. When faced with a
critical incident involving a staff member who was not performing satisfactorily, she drew upon
her personal value o f responsibility to decide in the moment to step up to a higher level of
responsibility for the organization and fire the employee. She described experiencing an
immediate, clear, yet unexpected insight that her core value o f responsibility now applied at the
organizational level. Her newly established identity as library director compelled her to hold
herself and the library personnel to a level o f responsibility she believed to be required o f a
highly effective organization.
She discussed how she felt confident to take respectful disciplinary action to remove an
underperforming employee and the experience instilled more confidence for future personnel
issues. She described this experience as defining because her decision and action to be
responsible for high standards o f performance informed how she would navigate staff issues into
the future. This circumstance confirms findings in other studies (Badaracco, 1997; Dahlvig &
Longman, 2010: Flanagan, 2002; M ackoff & Wenet, 2001) in which participants experienced
more clarity and purpose after a defining moment as well as greater sense o f confidence and
efficacy.

135

Another participant described a critical incident that fits within the Avolio and Luthans
(2006) description o f a trigger and elicited a moment o f clarity. The participant was new to the
rural library and, while helping a struggling student, decided to overlook lost book fees in order
to provide books o f interest to him. She explained an instantaneous understanding that support
for learning was more important than the stewardship o f attaining the $12 lost book fees. The
situation o f a child with a lost book fee likely occurs regularly in public libraries. However, in
this particular moment, the incident was defining for this new director because her decision,
based on a deeply held value o f learning, transformed her values priorities for her library. She
explained that she understood how her core value o f learning could be applied within the
community via the library and shifted the way she responded and how she asked other staff to
respond to such incidents in the future. Thus, the defining moment not only impacted her work
but informed organizational policy and culture into the future. M ackoff and Wenet (2001) refer
to these as knowing moments, which assume more meaning and significance than other life
moments. In this study, these trigger moments clarified how core values applied in new contexts.
As in other studies (Dahlvig & Longman, 2010; Janson, 2008; M ackoff & Wenet, 2001),
participants trusted their values and took action confidently based on them.
Another participant described a critical incident that could be considered a jolt (Avolio &
Luthans, 2006) after a natural disaster in the community. She had been briefed by the town
emergency team, which indicated that without basic infrastructure, civil unrest might occur.
While several people crowded into the public library, with a back-up generator, to charge
telephones, connect to Internet resources, and seek escape in pleasure reading, the participant
decided suddenly to take responsibility beyond her role as director. She stood up on a chair and
announced to the library users that supplies were limited and they all needed to evacuate the

136

town. She described this as defining because she overstepped her responsibility as the library
director and did so for the health and safety o f the town residents. She described a moment of
clarity and prompt action as well as later reflection that this was defining for her. Upon
reflection, she was surprised by her actions, yet confident she would do that same thing again if
ever in such a situation.
Insight Problem-solving
The previous examples o f defining moments involve situations in which the participants
were clear on the course they wished to take based on core values. Another type o f critical
incident identified by the literature is referred to as challenging dilemmas (Avolio & Luthans,
2006) in which an individual faces a challenge without knowing a clear path to resolution. It is
only through a method o f insight problem-solving that the participants found paths to resolution.
In response to challenging dilemmas, an individual is unclear about how to resolve an
issue and experiences uncertainty; these impasses can last days, weeks, months, or even years,
prior to an insight that reorients one’s perspective. These critical incidents often occurred when
participants were new to their positions or faced with a new assignment, such as building a
library or managing a service model change. Because the situation was new, participants
described taking time to reflect, consider the issues, and weigh the options before determining
how to proceed.
In two stories, participants described critical incidents in which it was clear that they
needed to make organizational changes but the process for determining the goal or direction of
those changes was unclear. In one situation the director oversaw a small community library with
decreasing use and decided that the library service model needed changing in order to remain
relevant in the community. In the other circumstance the director was new to a very large system

137

and recognized that the methods he used to lead smaller library systems were not sufficient for
the new environment. In both scenarios the participants described processes o f investigation,
experimentation, and consideration that unfolded over many months before complete
understanding and a path forward became clear to them. Along the way each director
experienced several insights that progressively informed the ultimate understanding o f how to
proceed. Once they each experienced the final insight, they became confident about how to lead
change.
Based on these stories and other participant stories, it appears that the nature o f the
problem can affect the length of time between when a problem arises and when the course o f
action becomes clear. O f greater interest is the process the participants followed to resolve the
various issues and gain insights about how to act. To consider the various problem-solving
techniques, the following section delves into research on insight problem-solving.
Literature on Insight Problem-solving
Insight problems are distinct circumstances in which an individual is faced with issues
that are new and different from those previously experienced (Bowden, Jung-Beeman, Fleck, &
Kounios, 2005; Dominowski & Dollab, 1995; Gick & Lockhart, 1995; Mayer, 1995; Patrick &
Ahmed, 2014). These insight problems require new, productive thinking (Mayer, 1995) in which
the individual invents a new way o f perceiving and solving the problem. Dominowski and
Dollab (1995) posit that insight problems are resolved when a new knowledge state is attained,
rather than simply applying a systematic process o f thinking, analyzing, and deciding based on
current knowledge.
Gick and Lockhart (1995) identify three stages o f insight problem-solving. Initially, the
problem solvers are aware that they lack the understanding o f how to proceed. In the second

138

stage, they realize that step-by-step reasoning will not lead to the solution. The stage after
identifying the problem and before the insight is called an impasse in which insight problem
solvers seek a solution beyond their current knowledge base. The impasse occurs because the
individual’s perception or representation o f reality is not sufficient to resolve the issue
(Dominowski & Dollab, 1995; Gick & Lockhart, 1995; Mayer, 1995; Patrick & Ahmed, 2014).
Thus, the individual considers the problem from many perspectives, including gathering new
knowledge and perspectives, in order to move beyond former representation to discover a new
approach to solving the issue.
After some time, the state o f new understanding is achieved often with a sudden
realization — the “Aha” moment — in which the solution is not only clear but seemingly
obvious (Gick & Lockhart, 1995). The experience o f insight often includes a feeling o f delight
or, in cases when the solution appears obvious, chagrin.
With regard to the impasse, fixed thoughts can hinder the process o f changing
representation (Gick & Lockhart, 1995). One could be viewing the current representation too
narrowly, such as considering the library to be merely a building for housing books rather than
an environment for acquiring and sharing knowledge. Or, one could assess the situation with
more complexity than is needed; simplification aids in resolution. A third circumstance involves
realizing that a completely new representation is required to solve the problem, prompting a
person to shift completely from one representation (e.g., the former director was competent) to a
new representation (e.g., the former director was not competent). Another point made by Gick
and Lockhart (1995) is that not all “Aha” moments in which representation changes immediately
lead to “Aha” solutions. For example, in the case involving awareness that the former director
was not competent, resolving the various legacy issues may require additional insights.

139

Regardless of the issue, resolving an impasse requires a new perspective, a new representation o f
the situation (Gick & Lockhart, 1995; Mayer, 1995).
Participant Strategies to Reach Insight
Several participants discussed their reflective processes as including talking through the
situation with a trusted person, such as a spouse, a colleague, or a mentor. Worline (2012)
suggests that conversations about organizational issues can create a deeper understanding and
shared meaning that builds confidence and trust in future action. In this study, the trusted
confidante either provided direct feedback on what to do, explored alternatives and options, or
offered reflection on the participant’s priorities and values. These interactions helped to clarify
the problem scope and provide alternatives. In a few cases it was during the conversation that the
participant realized which direction to choose.
In situations specific to managing change in libraries, participants described methods o f
gathering information from respected peers, professional journals and blogs, conferences, tours
o f other libraries, and perspectives gained from other professions, such as business
administration. These various venues allowed the participants to review a broad range o f
perspectives related to complex issues o f leading change in uncertain times. When considering
these variables, the participants sought to investigate and understand many options before
determining the course that they needed to take. In the end, they considered many perspectives,
then singularly constructed and implemented a change system based on their own preferences
and priorities. For example, the decision to change the library service model in a rural library
involved re-organizing one area o f the library as an “idea room” with comfortable furniture, new
books and magazines, and many places for conversation. Though other libraries had created

140

areas for experiential learning, the director described her unique vision as driven by the specific
interests and habits o f the residents o f the community.
At times the “Aha” moments occurred within the context o f the critical incident. In the
two cases involving challenges to library materials, both directors described community
meetings in which they defended free and open access to the entire collection without
censorship. Through navigation o f those meetings and other community interactions, the
directors obtained clarity about their roles and responsibilities as community leaders on topic of
intellectual freedom. Both described a deepening commitment to their values and new
understandings o f those values during participation in community meetings and other individual
interactions. These two situations suggest that being self-reflective and self-aware aided them in
responding appropriately.
Two participants discussed another technique for prompting insight and decision making,
namely rest and sleep. One director described gathering facts and information and weighing the
pros and cons o f each choice in a difficult situation. She described thinking “constantly” for a
two-week period about what to do and then finally deciding to “sleep on it.” When she awoke the
next morning, she was clear on which choice to make, and stated that she often makes decisions
in this way. Another director explained that he was awakened by an insight in the middle o f the
night. The problem was clear, upon awakening, and the diagnosis o f how to resolve the issue was
equally apparent. Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, and Bom (2004), describe a study in which
rest facilitates insight. Specifically, the participants in an experimental group gained insight more
quickly (more than twice as quickly) after resting than those in a control group who worked on
problem-solving without a break. The researchers theorize that rest and sleep allow the brain to
restructure representation o f a problem in order to allow for more expedient and insightful

141

problem-solving behavior. Certainly, the two stories in this dissertation indicate the potential
value o f sleep-aided revelations.
Complex Challenges Involving Relational Values Conflicts
The third path participants described in this study involved delayed action, even when
they had a clear preference for how to resolve an issue, because o f values conflicts with one or
more stakeholders. These situations align with Bacaracco’s (1997) description o f defining
moments in work termed complex challenges in which stakeholder relationships and competing
values require reflection, coaching, negotiation, and/or other relational techniques to reach
commonly acceptable resolution. Several participants described this type o f defining moment in
which determining the solution to an issue was prompt yet their approaches to critical incidents
were delayed in order to align with others prior to action. In these situations, the participants
realized what their preferences and values were, yet they were unwilling to act immediately on
that understanding. Gick and Lockhart (1995) describe situations in which “Aha” moments of
change in representation do not immediately lead to “Aha” solutions. In fact, in this study, some
participants described a conflict among competing values which accounted for this delay of
resolution.
Badaracco (1997) refers to defining moments without clear resolution as prompted by
conflicts among competing responsibilities. In these cases, personal integrity may suggest one
solution, but that path may negatively impact relationships with governing authorities. For
example, one director learned quite unexpectedly o f the previous director’s mismanagement o f
resources, requiring her to determine a course o f action that would resolve the issue quickly. The
incident had legal as well as other implications for the director and trustees; involving the
trustees in the resolution was essential yet certainly meant a rift would form between the trustees

142

and the current director. The competing values o f integrity and relationships made the decision
on how to negotiate the issue difficult; this example illustrates how dynamics in an organization
and among stakeholders impact defining moments (Badaracco, 1997). Others with a stake in the
outcome o f the critical incident influence how individuals resolve issues. In this case, the director
chose to be transparent about the process, which reinforced the value o f integrity for her in future
situations. While this critical issue was resolved within a few weeks due to its urgent nature,
some delays can take weeks or even months.
In response to critical incidents that involve conflicts with subordinates and supervisors,
study participants described values conflicts that prevented swift resolution. A common response
among all was to recognize the situations and to take the time to either mentor the staff or
negotiate with supervising authority. The interpersonal conflicts were uncomfortable,
particularly for those who indicated benevolence (Schwartz, 2012) was a core value. At the same
time, the deep commitment to being responsible for organizational outcomes enabled the
directors to bide time and persist with the course o f action they preferred with subordinates. As
indicated earlier, they were less successful with governing authorities, which raises questions
about power and influence; these are questions beyond the scope o f this study.
Two directors described prominent community members who challenged which materials
the library would house. These intellectual freedom incidents were unexpected and escalated to
public debates in the communities. Whereas the above critical incidents related to circumstances
with the board of directors, who might be considered internal stakeholders, intellectual freedom
challenges involved outside stakeholders in the community, thus elevating the defining moment
to complex dilemmas (Badaracco, 1997). Badaracco (1997) refers to this type o f defining
moment as “right versus right” in which the organizational leader is responsible to a variety of

143

stakeholders within and outside o f the organization. Badaracco (1997) posits that defining
moments reveal values, test the commitment to those values, and shape an individual’s character,
identity, and sense o f purpose. In these cases, the directors’ actions in response to intellectual
freedom had long-term impact on the libraries as well as how the community viewed the library.
Although each situation unfolded quietly at first, the directors eventually asserted themselves
into the public discourse and engaged the communities in debate.
These intellectual freedom situations were defining because they revealed the values o f
the library profession and the library director, tested the directors’ commitments to those values
in a public forum, and, ultimately, shaped how the directors’ and their libraries were perceived in
the community with regard to intellectual freedom. Dahlvig and Longman (2010) and Gentile
(2010) describe the importance o f managerial leaders articulating their values and modeling them
for others. These participants described the importance they placed on being the community
leader for intellectual freedom, describing the value as being instilled in youth.
The two participants spoke about how their personal values aligned with intellectual
freedom and how that gave them the courage to face opposition and overcome censorship in their
communities. One commonality shared by both participants was a childhood experience in the
public library that they described as influencing their conviction to uphold the principle of
intellectual freedom as a director. During their interviews, each participant told o f a formative
experience in which the public library o f their youth had been a refuge and support for
overcoming abusive situations and encouraging their intellectual discovery. These early
experiences with libraries, they explained, instilled the value o f intellectual freedom in a way that
gave them the courage and persistence to stand up against strong opposition and to define the
public library’s community role as ensuring the principle o f intellectual freedom.

144

In all o f these cases, the participants were guided and compelled by their values to make
difficult decisions. Some o f these decisions led to unqualified success, while others lead to
compromise, departure o f library personnel, or the resignation o f the director. In all o f these
situations their actions, and the results o f those actions, informed their sense o f identity into the
future.
Certainty and Confidence
Several studies on defining moments conclude that one result is self-confidence (Avolio
& Luthans, 2006; Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007; Dahlvig, & Longman, 2010; Flanagan, 2002;
M ackoff & Wenet, 2001). When faced with challenging critical incidents, participants in this
study initially experienced doubt, confusion, and frustration. However, once they gained insight,
they developed new perspectives on their values as well as more clarity on their identities,
certainty of decisions, and confidence.
One participant said that her two defining moments gave her a “much stronger sense o f
purpose and the confidence that that [decision] really is the right thing.” Another participant,
recalling the success of moving the library from its old building, said, “That move bumped the
confidence I had and set me on a good course.” A third participant described how standing up for
intellectual freedom led to professional involvement in the issue at the state and national level.
She said the experience “gave me that confidence” to step into a professional leadership position
when she had not previously perceived herself as a leader. The confidence and sense o f self
described in these examples were enduring in various aspects o f her work.
Whether participants described the impact o f their defining moments as one o f immediate
clarity, or as an experience that lead to deeper understanding upon reflection, they all described
having certainty about the decisions they made as a result o f the defining moment. Comments

145

included: “I knew I was right;” “I don’t care if someone’s looking or not, I ’m always going to do
the right thing;” and “I thought that that [decision] was the right thing to do.” Each statement
includes certainty based on core values that they consider to be fundamental to their work.
Badaracco (2013) addresses how challenges provoke the best in responsible managerial
leadership and that incremental decisions over time aimed in a particular direction, iterative and
adaptable, can increase certainty, confidence, and commitment to aspirational goals.
In considering the “right” thing, a few participants identified an aspirational quality o f
how they act upon their values in their work. One spoke o f comic book heroes as inspirations.
“These are all people who tried to help people and who always tried to do the right thing.” She
explained that she aspires to do the same in her work each day. Another said,
I think the combination o f all o f those experiences [defining moments]
probably have contributed to an innate sense that I am always trying to do the
best because that is the right thing to do. And that is what people expect, and
that is what is inspiring and motivates people, and I guess inspires and
motivates me as well.
The aspirational quality o f these statements confirms other research (Avolio & Luthans, 2006;
Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007; Dahlvig, & Longman, 2010; Flanagan, 2002; M ackoff & Wenet,
2001) that defining moments result in new meaning and purpose. They reinforce values in ways
that contribute to self-confidence and result in the individual assuming proactive, persistent
behavior in the workplace, including acting with courage (Badaracco, 2013).
Courage
Confidence in what is “right” is not always enough for an individual to move forward in
the face o f adversity. In contentious work situations, courage may be required to act (Badaracco,

146

2013; Worline, 2012). Courage in the work environment may entail taking risk, sustaining focus,
and persisting despite uncertainty or barriers (Badaracco, 2013); or it may relate to speaking up
for strongly held values and against social pressures to conform to unacceptable standards
(Worline, 2012). In addition, other researchers identify courage as related to integrity, honesty,
and authenticity (Peterson & Seligman, 2004; Rego, Cunha, & Clegg, 2012).
In this study, several participants spoke o f the need for courage related to acting on or
speaking up for strongly held values when the result could harm a relationship with library
personnel, supervisors, and/or community members. One participant described making a
conscious choice to “screw up the courage” to speak to subordinates about performance issues in
order to ensure quality service. Her description included the tension o f having to confront those
she knew well and challenge them to behave with more courtesy and helpfulness. Whereas a
confrontation like that may have been easy for someone else to resolve, fear (Worline, 2012)
required her to be courageous to resolve the issue.
In another story, the participant discussed how his sense o f responsibility gave him the
courage to direct the management team to take corrective action against employees who were
disrespectful to library users. In the above examples, the directors recognized their greater
responsibility for the organization and felt they needed to draw on courage to take personnel
actions against employees. These participants explained the anxiety they experienced in conflicts
with stakeholders, specifically when the conflicts involved direct confrontation with those to
whom they felt responsible. Many participants have a strong core value o f benevolence, which
relates to supporting individuals with whom they are in close contact (Schwartz, 1996, 2012).
The potential conflict between their value o f benevolence and their value o f integrity, or doing

147

the right thing for the organization, may have required them to draw on courage to undertake
personnel action on employees.
Participants also discussed the need for courage in other situations. One participant
discussed an intellectual freedom challenge by stating, “I felt like there was this act o f courage to
step into the controversy ...” in which the director was in conflict with community members and
spoke up for a core value even if it meant retribution. Courageous acts challenge processes or
people within a specific context, which often involves an individual acting for organizational or
social good (Worline, 2012) in the face o f fear, retribution, or failure (Rate, Clarke, Lindsay, &
Sternberg, 2007). In this case, the need for courage stemmed from a concern with stakeholder
relationships in the community. Not only was the director’s position potentially at risk, the
reputation o f the library and the values o f the profession were also at stake. In this and other
cases, the strongly held value of self-direction (independent thought and action) (Schwartz, 1996,
2012) relates in two ways. The director’s value o f self-direction, (e.g., independent thought and
action) applies to community members having access to uncensored materials, which provided
the compelling interest in defending the challenge. At the same time, the participants’
independent spirits emboldened the courageous act o f defending intellectual freedom.
While some researchers (e.g., Peterson & Seligman, 2004) consider courage to be a virtue
(value in action) in and of itself, Flanagan (2002) found that managerial leaders who are more
aware o f their core values face work challenges with courage. In other words, courage is not a
value that functions independently o f other values. Deeply held core values compel a person to
acts o f courage not for the end result o f having been courageous, but for the underlying value of,
for example, freedom or integrity.

148

Participants described drawing on courage to speak up and behave in ways that align with
core values in settings where relationships may have been threatened. For example, one
participant spoke o f confronting a staff member who was a long-time friend. The staff member
was not acting with honesty or integrity, values o f high priority to the participant. Courageous
acts are fueled by a certainty and commitment to the deeper values at stake. This conclusion
confirms other research (Badaracco, 2013; Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007), in which defining
moments clarify what matters, can require standing up for those values in adverse situations, and
instill a long-term commitment to the values.
Commitment and Persistence
In participant stories the commitment to the core value over time, persistence in action,
makes the experience defining (Avolio & Luthans, 2006; Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007). In this
study, participants spoke about how their responses instilled confidence and compelled them to
commit to a new value or recommit to an existing value over time. This combination of
confidence and commitment aligns with other researchers’ findings on organizational leadership
commitment (Pfeffer, 1992; Sull & Houlder, 2005), in which they conclude that past situations
and self-perception influence commitment and may result in consistency over time, which instills
trust and confidence from followers.
When organizational leaders commit to new ways o f thinking (M ackoff & Wenet, 2001),
and prioritizing values (Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007), they set the course for future decisions
and behaviors not only for themselves but also for the organization (Schein, 2010). They
establish policies, focus attention, and expect others in the organization to behave based on the
organizational leader’s prioritized values. Yet, some statements indicate that, even after an
experience o f facing a critical incident, weighing options, and making a decision, individuals still

149

may not take action (Pfeffer, 1992) or they may persist through resistance. For example, in one
interview a director concluded her story o f coaching a resistant employee by stating, “In the end,
when it resolved the way I felt it should have resolved, I felt much better; but there were
moments there when I said, ‘Oh, screw it, I don’t really want to deal with this, I’m leaving.’”
Another director similarly described her values conflict with library personnel by stating, “This
sounds really bad but if I weren’t so stubborn I probably would have left. Because, at my age,
I’m not sure that all the conflict and stress was worth it but, you know, it was.”
These examples allude to the likelihood that, when faced with some critical incidents,
participants may choose not to assert themselves and their core values. Along with participants
telling stories o f their defining moments in which they stepped up to achieve excellence, a few
also alluded to moments when their commitment waned. For example, one participant in
summing up the importance o f persisting through challenging situations stated,
I have known a number o f directors, they are really nice people, really great
people, [but they] were really poor directors. And the difference was that
unwillingness to commit to ... to step up in the middle o f a controversy and
go through that awkward period where you are trying to figure it out and sort
through who is right and keep asking the questions and not lose your cool.
This statement underscores the importance for organizational leaders to persist consciously,
including staying focused and alert throughout the process o f resolving critical incidents. Indeed,
in managerial leadership, defining moments may distinguish the effective from ineffective based
on how the person in the position responds to critical events (Bennis & Thomas, 2002,2007;
Mackoff, & Wenet, 2001).

150

As with other research (Avolio & Luthans, 2006; Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007), this
study confirms that managerial leaders can respond to critical incidents with a clear sense o f core
values and a deep commitment to those values. Certainly one can imagine situations in which a
managerial leader may choose to face challenging issues at work by maintaining the status quo
rather than aspiring to excellence (Quinn, 2005). In addition, those in managerial leadership
positions who perceive that the organization is running smoothly, may relax their commitment to
core values and aspirational goals (Quinn, 2005). To address these issues, Quinn (2005) suggests
managerial leaders need self-awareness, self-regulation, and a consistent commitment to core
values.
Badaracco (2013) describes responsible organizational leaders as those who take their
responsibilities seriously by proactively resolving struggles. He goes further to suggest that some
organizational leaders seek out challenges and struggles to elicit their best effort. In this study,
participants described their defining moments as striving to overcome issues in order to attain a
higher standard o f service or impact, although the focus was less on striving for the sake of
overcoming challenges than for achieving an aspirational goal. In fact, defining moments, and
specifically those moments o f deeper meaning, can aid in achieving excellence if organizational
leaders choose to step up to the challenge, navigate through discomfort, persist over time, and
draw on their core values. These strategies ultimately define not only the values o f the
organizational leaders, but also the values and the future goals o f the organizations they oversee.
Conclusion
Public library directors who participated in this research responded to critical incidents in
ways they identified as defining. By analyzing the processes they used to resolve critical
incidents, the concept o f one singular moment having more meaning than others (M ackoff &

151

Wenet, 2001) is placed into question. Study participants described multiple moments o f meaning
that contributed to the defining aspect o f these life events. They used reflection to clarify their
values preferences and to commit to those values, thus reaffirming them for future situations.
Defining moments are turning points in life, typically unexpected, and involve a moment
o f insight, or an epiphany, that clarifies a new path or strengthens resolve for the future. In some
cases, sudden insights were enough to clarify values and meaning. In other situations,
participants consciously chose to persist or act with courage to attain their values priorities; these
moments had meaning because o f the intentionality o f instilling those values in defining ways.
Participants also discussed meaningful moments o f certainty about decisions, specific instances
in which they experienced more confidence, and singular points at which self-awareness and
identity became clearer. In addition, participants described moments in which they recognized a
greater sense o f purpose in their work and the work o f their libraries. Thus, at any stage o f
resolving critical incidents, clarifying values, and defining self, specific moments o f meaning
may occur.
Other research (Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007; M ackoff & Wenet, 2001) points to how
organizational leaders actively engage others by articulating core values and the meaning o f the
defining moments in organizations. Similarly, participants in this study described how their
willingness to speak up for core values and aspirational results, such as high quality library
service and intellectual freedom, resulted in stronger commitments to those values in the future
and also operationalized these values in organizations they oversee.
In addition, study participants indicated that values from youth influence how they chose
to respond to critical incidents. Specifically, reflecting on core values, including those instilled in
youth, emboldens some o f the library directors to face challenging dilemmas with courage and

152

persistence. Badaracco (2006; 2013) posits that the organizational leader has additional
responsibilities for setting the direction o f the organization, being accountable for the success or
failure o f the organization, and managing authority over personnel. As found in this study, the
role o f public library director requires acting with responsibility to a broad array o f stakeholders
within and outside of the organization. The next chapter focuses on various managerial
leadership behaviors discussed by study participants and related to the public administration
literature on accountability and responsibility in order to gain greater understanding o f influences
on participants’ work behavior.

CHAPTER FIVE
RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN
PUBLIC LIBRARY DIRECTORSHIPS

A primary theme among participants was a sense o f responsibility inherent in the position
o f public library director and an ongoing commitment to accountability. This chapter places
responsibility and accountability in the arena o f public administration and discusses areas of
responsibility that participants identified as relating to their work. The chapter outlines a variety
o f stakeholders identified by participants and examples o f responsibilities as they relate to these
stakeholders. The chapter includes discussions about self-regulation, purpose, and passion at
work, which are concepts that the participants related to their work responsibilities. The
participants perceived their responsibilities less as obligatory duties and more as an opportunity,
and even meaningful, purposeful aspects o f their work.
Definitions of Responsibility and Accountability
For managerial leaders, responsibility and accountability are interrelated concepts in
public administration. One distinction is that responsibility is associated with positional authority
entrusted to managerial leaders in order to perform duties that benefit stakeholders, whereas
accountability relates to the parameters o f those duties as well as the evaluation and assessment
o f the processes and results (Dunn & Legge, 2001). Put simply, the governing authority
empowers managerial leaders with responsibility and constrains them with accountability (Dunn
& Legge, 2001). For example, in public libraries, the director is empowered to oversee all
aspects o f library operations, including fiscal management, human resources, facilities, and
operations as well as the oversight o f professional library responsibilities, such as collection
management, library services, and programs. Along with this authority is the public trust that the
158

director will manage finances and resources responsibly as well as ensure that services are
provided equitably, efficiently, and effectively. To ensuring these responsibilities are carried out,
the governing authority and the public may hold the director accountable by establishing
mechanisms, such as reporting procedures that document processes and results. Thus, one aspect
o f responsibility and accountability is that they function in conjunction with the other,
responsibility enabling performance and accountability constraining it (Wallis & Gregory, 2009).
Responsibility in public administration encompasses obligations or expectations to
perform specified activities that impact a targeted group (or groups) o f stakeholders, including
the public (Petter, 2005; Wallis & Gregory, 2009). Although researchers (e.g., Petter, 2005;
Wallis & Gregory, 2009) focus on responsibility in public administration as obligations or
expectations (self-imposed or by others), other researchers (e.g., Dunn & Legge, 2001) highlight
the public trust placed on public administrators. Public trust relates to authority given with the
expectation that publically-funded resources and services are managed with integrity and fairness
(Dunn & Legge, 2001). Therefore, public officials are obligated to consider how their positional
authority, to which they have been entrusted, both empowers and requires them to maintain
responsible behavior (Dunn & Legge, 2001) and ensure effective results (Brown & Trevino,
2006; Waldman & Galvin, 2008).
Accountability provides public officials with specific definitions, guidance on duties and
processes, and clarification of responsibilities to ensure they meet these expectations (Dunn &
Legge, 2001). Accountability provides a check to trustworthiness (Wallis & Gregory, 2009) and
is externally directed or imposed as a restriction on empowered responsibilities (Behn, 2001) in
order to ensure controllability and answerability o f public administrators (Wallis & Gregory,
2009).

159

Responsibility and Accountability to Whom
The primary role o f managerial leaders is to be responsible and accountable (Salminen &
Lehto, 2012). Freeman (1984) adds that managerial leaders are responsible to a multitude of
stakeholders, which he defines as individuals or entities working within or outside o f the
organization who affect the organization or could be affected by it. Stakeholders in the private
sector include employees, governing authorities, shareholders, customers, vendors, and others
who affect or are affected by organization (Voegtlin, 2011). In addition, the broader community
and society are stakeholders that may be affected by the organization’s activities or products
(Pless & Maak, 2011).
Public sector stakeholders include internal and external stakeholder groups. Table 5.1
lists stakeholders identified from business research (Voegtlin, 2011) and those stakeholders
discussed by study participants. Because participants described stakeholders through stories, the
list is not comprehensive.

Voegtlin (2011) and those discussed by study participants. For example, both identify the
importance of internal stakeholders, such as employees and managers, and external agents, such
as customers. Whereas business managerial leaders have fiduciary responsibilities to
shareholders and investors, public library directors, as public administrators, have fiduciary
accountability to taxpayers (Petter, 2005; Salminen & Lehto, 2012), as well as a governing
authority. The plethora o f stakeholders inventoried illustrates a complex environment in which
organizational leaders need to manage a multitude o f relationships and competing interests.
As with other research (Freeman, 1984; Pless & Maak, 2011; Voegtlin, 2011), this study
identifies how stakeholders influence the decisions managerial leaders make and the activities
they prioritize. With limited resources, the interests o f one stakeholder may compete with
another. For example, in several stories the directors were attempting to make changes in library
service that they believed would make the library more relevant to the community. Some
personnel, internal stakeholders, were resistant, prompting the directors to choose between the
library personnel or the public. In the stories o f competing stakeholder interests, participants
used their core values, professional values, and consideration o f a multitude o f stakeholders to
make choices. Thus, values inform the process o f discerning which responsibilities and
relationships to prioritize in the public library environment.
Responsibility and Accountability for What
Along with core values influencing decisions, public administrators have heightened
pressure from outside stakeholders who track public sector organizational performance and hold

161

managerial leaders accountable by demanding more transparency than is practiced in the private
sector (Cooper, 2012, Dunn & Legge, 2001; Petter, 2005; Wallis & Gregory, 2009). Within this
context, public administrators have the responsibility to affect positive organizational results for
multiple external stakeholders, including members o f the public and a variety o f formal and
informal community representatives. In addition, the managerial leader has responsibility for
effective and efficient performance processes and personnel development (Pless, & Maak, 2011).
Researchers (e.g., Orazi, Turrini, & Valotti, 2013; Petter, 2005) posit that, in the public sector,
optimal effectiveness in managerial leadership requires a balance between transactional
responsibilities (e.g., financial accountability to community stakeholders, a commitment to
integrity, and adherence to professional ethics) and activities designed for transformational
growth o f the staff and organization. Study participants described both transactional
responsibilities o f financial accountability as well as transformational responsibility to develop
library staff. In addition, they discussed the primary responsibility to provide services that
positively impacted community members. The multitude o f responsibilities identified by study
participants parallels other research in public administration (Behn, 2001; Petter, 2005).
Petter (2005) surveyed the public administration literature regarding responsibility and
developed a list o f areas in which the managerial leader operates. At the personal level, public
administrators feel responsible both for the values and ethics o f their profession and their own
personal values and morals. Within the organization, they are responsible for the organizational
and personnel aspects o f the operation in order to ensure quality performance and positive
results. In addition, they are responsible for fiscal integrity o f the organization as well as meeting
the needs o f consumers. In the broader external environment, public administrators assume the

162

responsibility to carry out their duties legally with integrity, and for being accountable to the
public, which relies on, and funds, their agency.
To ensure responsibilities are carried out in the public sphere, Behn (2001) posits that
public administration requires three specific types o f accountability: democratic accountability,
managerial competence (primarily financial), and performance. He defines democratic
accountability similarly to the previous definitions o f responsibility related to public trust by
noting that administrators have the power to allocate funds and resources and, therefore, should
do so with integrity and fairness. Accountability with managerial competence relates to
overseeing finances with integrity, and performance accountability relates to both the results of
the organization and the processes used.
Based on the stakeholders described by study participants and the themes related to
responsibility and accountability, Table 5.2 illustrates those areas o f responsibility that
participants identified. Although this table does not represent a comprehensive list o f public
library director responsibilities, which is outside the scope o f this study, it provides a snapshot of
the responsibilities for which participants feel accountable. Participants discussed their core and
professional values as influencing their decisions and actions, thus they feel responsible to
uphold these values in their work. In addition, they described external responsibility within the
communities they serve (e.g., library users, library governing authorities, and the public
public/taxpayers), and organizational responsibilities to the governing authority as well as for
finance, planning, operations, performance, and personnel professional development.

The following sections address the major areas o f responsibility the participants
identified, and relate those themes to the public administration literature on responsibility and
accountability. The purpose o f this examination is to consider various arenas o f responsibility in
public library administration and how participants’ stories depict the complex array o f competing
responsibilities, accountabilities, and stakeholders.
Financial Responsibility
In the public accountability literature (e.g., Behn, 2001) financial accountability and
responsibility are primary considerations for the organization. Although this was not a major
topic o f discussion, in six interviews participants spoke o f their responsibility to taxpayers,
trustees, and other community leaders. They stated that they consider these stakeholders when
making decisions and prioritizing library services and activities. For example, one participant
stated, “I feel a real sense o f responsibility to make sure that we are being good stewards o f the
taxpayers’ money.” Another participant said, “There is a serious side o f a library district. We are

164

a government [agency] and we have to act responsibly ... fiscally and ... we are making
[policies] for the way our library runs.” This sense o f stewardship indicates an understanding of
the public role to prioritize financial integrity over self-interest (Behn, 2001). A third participant
stated, “[The library] is a town department so it is important to understand how the rest o f the
town works, to be able to work with the town accountant and treasurer and also the town
administrator.” These statements indicate that these participants understand the importance of
financial accountability and consider this responsibility within the overall framework o f the local
government infrastructure as well as in regard to their accountability to taxpayers.
Fair and Equitable Service
Another primary responsibility o f public agencies is democratic accountability (Behn,
2001; Dunne & Legge, 2001), which is primarily focused on fairness. Because all citizens pay
for public services, the democratic principles o f equity and fairness require public administrators
to ensure equal access to those services. This duty was discussed by several study participants,
including five participants who emphasized the importance o f equal access for all people and for
all intellectual pursuits. For example, one participant stated,
I think increasingly what has become primary for me in this particular role is
the value I have for equity, equity of access, equity more importantly of
opportunity. I think partly because o f my role, [and] partly because I feel like
the world is getting less and less equitable, that the library has a real
opportunity to impact [equity] and I would argue a responsibility to try to
impact [equity]. ... We have a responsibility and a really wonderful
opportunity to create those opportunities for people who wouldn't have them
otherwise.

165

This example addresses accountability and responsibility for the public good discussed in the
literature (Behn, 2001; Dunne & Legge, 2001).
Another participant described a sense o f responsibility to provide fair and open access to
information by stating the role o f library services as “responsiveness to every single mind in the
community even if [we don’t] agree with them.” This example reflects the importance this
participant placed on equity o f access to information and specifically as it relates to supporting
intellectual freedom regardless o f the subject matter pursued.
Along with the primary role of democratic accountability being discussed specifically
with regard to equity, participants also spoke more generally about the responsibility they felt to
ensure the library provides useful services to the public. One library director stated, “I think that
the primary responsibility o f library leaders is that you are making things better for your
community, stakeholders o f the institution.” Another participant said, “Mostly I really feel
responsible for providing what we need and want in our community— services for all people.” A
third participant described her motivation as “a feeling o f responsibility that we provide the very
best service.” Similarly, another participant summed up his priorities, including “providing the
best possible service to the public that we can, and staying in touch with them and their needs
and their wants— actually, trying to stay a little bit ahead o f them in their needs and their wants,
which can be a real challenge.” These statements indicate that the study participants have
compelling commitments to be responsible for library services that meet community needs.
More specific to the types o f services offered, one participant spoke o f confidentiality as
a fundamental responsibility o f her job. She considers privacy a particularly important issue in a
small town in which everyone knows each other. She said,

166

The town is so small that everybody knows everybody’s business, but the
library’s been the one place that people come in and they know that they’re
seeing what you would find in a big city library — all [library user]
information is confidential. And that they will approach us and talk about
very sensitive topics or get help with sensitive topics and feel comfortable
that we’re not going to go out and — it w on’t be in the latest rumor that’s
going around town.
In this case, the statement indicates a commitment to the professional value of
confidentiality, yet the underlying motivation is a sense o f responsibility to respect the privacy o f
those who use the library, including those individuals who to seek information on sensitive
topics. So, although confidentiality is a professional value, the fundamental drive comes from the
public administrator’s feeling o f responsibility to respect the privacy o f community members’
intellectual pursuits, which aligns with the responsibility for democratic accountability (Behn,
2001) discussed in the public administration literature.
Performance Accountability and Responsibility
Another area o f responsibility and accountability relates to performance, including
effective processes and results (Behn, 2001). One participant stated, “There is an enormous
responsibility that comes with being in a leadership role, and it is around being accountable.” He
asserted that everyone working in the public library needs to perform well and demonstrate the
results o f that performance transparently with the community. Although this perspective on
public library responsibility may not be shared by all who work in libraries, several study
participants discussed a similar sense o f responsibility and accountability.

167

The public sector often struggles with providing performance accountability because o f a
lack o f clearly defined benchmarks for performance results (Behn, 2001). In library and
information science (LIS), some researchers (e.g., Dugan, Hemon, & Nitecki, 2009) provide
guidance on library metrics including inputs, outputs, and outcomes for public libraries. In this
study, several directors spoke o f their interest in demonstrating performance accountability and
determining success. One participant stated, “It [the library] is really successful because basically
everybody in the community gets what they want and more from the library, and the staff is very
engaged and constantly learning.” Another said, “ [The library’s] use is through the roof, and
that’s what it’s supposed to be. And that for me is the biggest indicator o f how much it’s used.
And it’s used 10 times more than it was [when I became director].” These examples speak to a
prevailing assumption among study participants that library use is an indicator o f performance
results and that higher use demonstrates effective performance results o f the library. However,
LIS literature offers many more ways to measure library performance for accountability.
Behn’s (2001) concept o f performance accountability also relates to efficiency in
operations, which participants discussed particularly as it relates to personnel. Managerial
leaders make decisions that impact the lives and work of library personnel (e.g., hiring,
conducting performance appraisals, determining wages, and firing). Because o f this authority,
they have responsibility to engage with personnel and to do so with integrity (Badaracco &
Ellsworth, 1998). This responsibility relates to ensuring that employees understand and act in
accordance with the obligations and expectations placed upon them by the organization as well
as outside entities. One participant stated that, when she was appointed director,
Suddenly I realized th a t... I had to look at my job from the point o f view o f
all the other people whose jobs were dependent on how well I did mine. I

168

realized that my responsibility here was bigger than I had imagined; and it
mattered a lot in the everyday lives o f a lot o f other people in ways that I just
hadn’t counted on and hadn’t thought about.
Another participant stated, “I’m the one [who is] the director o f the library, if they (staff) have
issues they’re going to be coming to me. I wouldn’t look at it as they’re working for me. I work
for them.” These comments indicate a sense o f responsibility to library personnel because the
director has ultimate decision-making authority as well as is accountable for results.
In some cases, participants spoke with pride about being responsible for these various
commitments. For example, one o f them said, “When something goes wrong, everybody in the
group knows that they just need to call me or get me out o f whatever I am doing. I’m the one that
is supposed to fight for things; that responsibility is not on them.”
Along with these obligations to oversee issues, participants also mentioned their
responsibility to adapt to and to make changes. One participant stated, “As the director I have a
lot more ability to affect change and help people than most o f the people on staff. I think it's
critical to remember that.” This statement not only describes the positional authority that allows
a director to make change but also implies an obligation to be the person who orchestrates
change because the director uniquely has the authority to do so. She described her method as
empowering library personnel, “So I empower others to use their good ideas. I don't have the
best ideas in the library; other people have great ideas and I can make them happen. ... But I
have to remember that they ... they don't necessarily feel they have the authority. So that is
something that I try to really be mindful of.” She described a circumstance in which library staff
expressed frustration that their supervisors were not listening to their ideas. To address this
concern, the director established idea development teams. These teams encompass personnel

169

across the organization in order to develop new ideas throughout the library and a widespread
understanding of how ideas are implemented. She said, “It took some time, but the ideas that
came out o f it were phenomenal, and I think really improved library service in the long run.”
Participants also spoke o f the responsibility they accept, as the public library director, to
ensure a standard for employee performance. For example, one stated, “I make a difference, the
[administrative] team makes a difference, the board makes a difference, but it’s those people out
on the floor, day to day, long term, that really do— really are the ones that impact the services
and how we do it.” Participants discussed how they hold employees accountable for articulated
service standards and take corrective action when employees underperform or are resistant
meeting job requirements. They mentioned the importance o f providing clear expectations for
library staff. These expectations often have an aspiring organizational quality, such as excellent
service, equal access for all, meaningful impact on library users, and expectations o f “the best”
effort from staff. One participant spoke o f the need to be “crystal clear about expectations and
holding [library staff] accountable to deliver on performance.” Certainly, articulating
expectations is an important aspect o f managerial leadership. In addition, the managerial leader
is responsible for assessing library personnel skills, abilities, and performance in order to hold
employees are accountable for conducting themselves in alignment with organizational values,
processes, and results.
Personnel Development
Beyond the previously described methods o f improving procedures, articulating clear
expectations, and correcting performance, participants also discussed the responsibility they have
to develop library personnel, their skills, abilities, and performance. Managerial leaders can
engage responsibly with employees by using both transactional methods (e.g., job descriptions,

170

performance evaluations) and transformational methods (e.g., modeling, coaching, and
professional development) (Groves & LaRocca, 2011; Orazi, et al., 2013). The transactional
methods provide structure and the transformational techniques build skills and capacity over
time. Effective managerial leaders use a combination o f a hierarchical, transactional approaches
and transformational behaviors, such as role modeling, coaching, and professional development.
Role modeling involves demonstrating through words and actions the behaviors and values the
supervisor wishes to see in the employees. Coaching goes beyond modeling to engage in inquiry,
dialogue, and feedback with employees related to specific activities and results. Coaching is
beneficial in both developing individual competence and encouraging values congruence among
managerial leaders and employees (Dolan & Raich, 2013). These strategies o f modeling and
coaching are aimed at developing employee competence and outputs, aligning employees with
organizational values, and subsequent improve overall organizational performance (Dolan &
Raich, 2013; Kouzes & Posner, 2007).
With regard to serving as a role model and coach for employees, nearly all participants
stated that leadership includes developing employee abilities and modeling desired behaviors and
values for employees. For example, one participant explained her leadership philosophy as
“giving your best; then people are going to succeed in their own work and their work as a
group.” Another participant said o f leading a change initiative, “I did more in the modeling way
...” to influence others to change. When speaking o f how she viewed leadership, one participant
said, “Definitely a large measure o f it is by example ... definitely living it.” These statements
suggest alignment with the assertions by Kouzes and Posner (2007) that, when managerial
leaders demonstrate their values through actions, it reinforces the values and behaviors they wish
to see in others.

171

In larger organizations, one strategy is to ensure that all supervisors consistently model
the values and behaviors that they wish to see adopted by all employees (Petter, 2005). For
example, one participant described leveraging the upper management team to model desired
behaviors. He said, “there is no way that one person can truly have the ability to monitor and
engage with all of the people that it takes to get an organization to move forward; it has to be a
collective process.” To this end, he works closely with supervisors on consistency in articulating
and modeling organizational values and behaviors in order to spread those throughout the library
system.
In addition, several participants described how they motivate personnel to take
responsibility by encouraging them to contribute to organizational decision making. One said, “It
is a very flat organization where everybody’s input is welcome.” Another summed up her
strategy by stating, “I empower others to use their good ideas.” A third explained that she pays
attention to “having that [verbal] space open for people to contribute.” These examples indicate
the importance o f listening to those who work in the library and encouraging them to provide
input, make suggestions, and take responsibility for decisions about library operations.
In addition to encouraging engagement through contributions, participants discussed
employee professional development as important. For example, when talking about how she
defines leadership, one participant said, “I think the other part o f leadership is— growing those
around you.” Another explained her managerial leadership style as “depending on what the
situation is ... I think I’m willing to share leadership [with employees] if I see that there’s a
demonstrated interest and ability to be a leader.” A third participant stated that she thinks about
both what a person needs to learn and when to provide specific opportunities. She said, “Having
the ability to know when is the right time to challenge somebody to take on some new leadership

172

or to get out o f their comfort zone is a really important role o f a leader.” Similarly, another
participant said,
I give people options for activities that I know they’ll appreciate and they’ll
jum p on and they’ll fly with; and I don’t give people jobs where there’s a
likelihood o f them doing something that’s mediocre or that they’ll fail. And
I’m not expecting just because you have a job title that you’re 100% perfect at
that job, no matter what somebody gives you. So it’s more customized what I
ask people to do.
These statements about the responsibility o f the managerial leader in developing employees
indicate a strong commitment to being responsible not just for the basic operational integrity of
the library but also for the continued professional development o f library personnel.
Balance of Responsibilities and Accountability
In considering the various responsibilities o f a managerial leader, at times stakeholders
may have competing interests, such as library employees who only want to maintain traditional
print collections and community members who seek electronic resources. The managerial leader
is responsible for prioritizing and/or balancing such interests (Doh & Quigley, 2014; Petter,
2005). In this environment o f competing stakeholder interests, public administrators may over­
focus on one area o f responsibly while being less responsible, or even irresponsible, in another
(Petter, 2005). Certainly, participants’ stories o f previous directors indicate that public library
directors may over-focus, for example, on organizational service responsibilities while not
attending to fiscal responsibilities. These circumstances provide cautionary examples that are
instructive and may point to the need for public library directors to consider a balance o f
stakeholder responsibilities as suggested of the public administration literature (Petter, 2005).

173

Core values inform how a managerial leader chooses among stakeholder responsibilities,
such as when participants in this study prioritized openness to change in services rather than an
interest in maintaining the status quo. Some study participants spoke o f considering broader
societal changes and external forces which compelled them to change library services. These
decisions created conflicts, at times, with the library board o f trustees or library personnel. Such
issues illustrate how stakeholder interests can conflict and the public library director must make
choices based on their core values. In addition, directors may misjudge priorities among
competing stakeholder interests and create difficulties for their libraries and/or themselves as
discussed in the following section.
Accountability, Misconduct, and Mismanagement
Public library governance often includes a volunteer board o f trustees that is appointed by
a governing authority with evaluation o f this board being locally determined (Ams, 2007;
Snyder, 2006). Within this context it is reasonable to assume that some board members are more
qualified to provide oversight o f public library activities, whereas others are less so. For
example, in this study some participants spoke o f board members who neither possessed the
business administration experience or interest to conduct library fiduciary responsibilities with
due diligence. In these situations previous library directors were not held accountable and, in
fact, given less oversight than was prudent. In many cases, public agencies also need to undergo
external audits and oversight, yet this delays the ability to quick identify issues o f financial
mismanagement (Snyder, 2006).
With considerable responsibility and freedom, some directors misuse their authority
(Snyder, 2006; Snyder & Hersberger, 1997). In the 1990s Snyder and Hersberger (1997)
documented several case studies to illustrate that financial fraud public libraries occurs and that

174

embezzlement is a common problem for which library boards and librarians need better training,
internal controls, and financial management procedures to reduce fraud. The majority o f reported
incidents involved the directors o f public libraries with inefficient operations, unreliable financial
reporting, and/or lack o f compliance with standard procedures, rules, or laws (Snyder, 2006;
Snyder & Hersberger, 1997), which may lead to misconduct.
In addition to intentional fraud or abuse, some library directors are simply incompetent at
one or more areas o f their complex responsibilities. Particularly in smaller town libraries, the
requirements for becoming directors may not include training or education in librarianship,
management, or public administration. Most specifically, directors are required to oversee the
budget, and this requirement assumes a level o f financial training or experience that may not be
present. Although library research is scarce in this area, four stories in this study indicate that at
least some public library directors lack competence and that, when they leave, the new directors
have critical issues to resolve. For example, two participants spoke o f choosing to address
directly with the board o f trustees the issue o f the previous directors’ unsatisfactory performance.
In both cases, the participants mentioned the importance o f transparent communication, integrity
with decision making, and responsibility when resolving issues. In these situations, the defining
events required them to shift the organizational values to focus on more accountability and
responsibility in financial governance. Both participants discussed their commitment to be
accountable to the library board and to be good stewards o f library funds and resources for which
they have been entrusted by the public.
Along with misconduct and incompetence, an issue that arose in this study was that o f
two participants being falsely accused o f misconduct. This type o f critical incident is referred to
as negative personal experiences (McCall, Lombardo, & Morrison, 1988) in which the resulting

175

issues have both personal as well as professional negative implications. These critical incidents
involve misperceptions and, because the role o f public library director involves autonomy,
outside stakeholders responded to false allegations negatively by withdrawing trust. These
circumstances are instructive and indicate the vital need for transparency and sufficient
documentation that may save a director time and anguish if wrongly accused o f misconduct.
Self-Regulation
Study participants also shared descriptions o f self-regulation in their behaviors. Self­
regulation is associated with exerting self-control over thoughts, emotions, or behaviors (Yeow
& Martin, 2013) in order to meet an internal standard (Gardner, Avolio, Luthans, May, &
Walumbwa, 2005). For example, a library director may choose to control anger in an interaction
in order to adhere to a core value of respect in interpersonal interactions. Because self-regulation
is prompted by internal desires (Gardner et al., 2005; Vancouver & Day, 2005), values are at the
center o f these decisions, as well as a desire to maintain behavioral consistency when attempting
reach a goal (Vancouver & Day, 2005; Yeow & Martin, 2013). For instance, in the above case,
the director may have a broader goal o f modeling respectful interpersonal interactions for library
personnel, which required self-regulation to be respectful when any rude individual makes the
director angry. Thus, individuals choose to regulate their thoughts, emotions, or behaviors based
on core values and goals they wish to attain.
This self-mediating process also is associated with positive organizational outcomes and
increased managerial leadership competency (Yeow & Martin, 2013). For example, in a
longitudinal study o f work teams, the team leaders who were instructed on self-regulation
activities, such as exerting extra effort, were rated higher by employees in terms o f their own
satisfaction and that with the leaders’ work. Team leader self-evaluations for those with self­

176

regulation training and practice rated themselves higher in performance effectiveness and
satisfaction than those in the control groups. In addition, the groups with team leaders who self­
regulated behavior achieved higher financial performance relative to the control groups (Yeow &
Martin, 2013). When individuals self-regulate thoughts, emotions, and/or behaviors, they may
focus more on the quality and effectiveness o f their work.
In this study, participants described self-regulation as a mechanism to maintain
responsibility as well as to be responsive to stakeholders when seeking to achieve stated goals.
For example, one participant described hosting two or three lunches a week for the first few
years o f his directorship with community leaders in order to discuss library priorities and gain
their input on the strategic planning process. He described how he regulated his urge to describe
details about the library in order to listen to and understand their perspectives on community
needs. Another participant described her philosophy on the responsibility o f the library director
in the community in this way:
A leader o f a public library today has to be a diplomat. They have to be a
pragmatist and they have to be able to compromise. They have to care
about their public, and they have to know what their public is interested in
in terms o f access. And they have to be ready to partner all around in their
community, to link the library to other institutions that are o f high value in
the community, whether it’s the school, a museum, non-profits, or all o f
those. The library director has to be ready to say, the library fits in here,
this is how the library fits in. And it’s not in a secondary way, but as an
equal way or primary way with those other institutions.

177

Some participants described their role as director in terms o f how they behave within the
community because they are perceived as the persona o f the library. One participant said, “I
remember a colleague shared an article ... that said that a [Chief Executive Officer] needs to
remember [that the] microphone is always on and it is always amplified.” This concept informs
how the participant conducts himself. He said, “I was probably funnier but a little bit more on the
edge when I was younger. I look back on some o f the things I did; I probably wouldn’t do them
today.” Whereas this was spoken by an urban library director, the director o f the smallest rural
library stated something similar: “Especially [as] the director, you’ve got to watch [your
behavior] for PR reasons. The library is you, and a reflection o f you. If you’re rude to someone,
or you act on your first impulse - you’ve got to be able to control that.” Another participant
explained her decision not to be involved in other leadership positions within her community.
She said, “I strongly believe that a library director needs to be apolitical in the community. If I
clutter up my agenda with memberships and political activities, then I’m not able to do for the
library what I might do otherwise.” This awareness o f the library director’s persona in the
community was noted by four participants who serve in communities o f different sizes and parts
o f the country. In each case the overarching theme was the recognition that they are responsible
for regulating their rhetoric and behaviors in order to represent the library well to external
stakeholders.
Self-regulation involves controlling one’s state o f mind (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee,
2002) as well as behaviors (Vancouver & Day, 2005). In order to self-regulate, the individual
needs to be self-aware (Goleman et al., 2002) and mindful o f the present situation as well as
reflective about values priorities. In discussing self-regulations, some participants identified
mindfulness at work as important, and specifically as a motivation for deliberative and self-

178

regulating behavior in consideration o f library stakeholders. For example, one participant said of
mindfulness, “It makes me pay attention to what I'm doing and how I'm impacting other people.”
In addition to mindfulness, participants discussed reflection as another activity they used
to consider issues, weigh responsibilities, and make decisions. Although not all participants
pointed out the specific techniques o f mindfulness, reflection, and self-regulation, each told
stories that indicated that he/she reflects on situations, deliberates using core values, and exhibits
self-regulating behaviors in order to be responsible to stakeholders.
Purposeful Nature of Responsibility
As with other managerial leaders, public library directors uniquely have responsibility
and accountability to a multitude o f stakeholders within and outside o f the organization. Petter’s
(2005) definition o f responsibility includes the terms “obligation” and “expectation,” which
connote a requirement rather than an opportunity. In addition, he states that these obligations can
be either self-imposed or expected by other stakeholders. Within this context, responsibility may
be assumed as having to conduct oneself in a particular way for others or wanting to for selfmotivating reasons. The first type o f responsibility is externally imposed accountability, whereas
an intrinsically motivated sense o f responsibility is shaped by core values and a sense o f purpose
and meaning.
In this study participants spoke o f their responsibilities with a sense o f purpose rather
than burden. Theorists (e.g., Badaracco, 2013; Cameron, 2011) discuss the purposeful nature and
aspirational quality o f managerial leadership. Cameron (2011) suggests that some responsible
managerial leaders believe in the Aristotelian concept that humans are inclined to moral
goodness. He asserts that this intrinsic motivation compels some managerial leaders to assume
responsibilities that positively impact a diverse array o f stakeholders. Cameron’s theory echoes

179

the tone o f the interviews in which the study participants mentioned how their core values,
specifically those related to societal enhancement (e.g., benevolence and universalism), motivate
them to assume responsibility for meeting the requirements o f various stakeholders.
Based on his analysis o f case studies o f managerial leaders in the private sector,
Badaracco (2013) concluded that responsible managerial leaders respond to uncertainty and
disruptive challenges by exerting their best effort and by striving to do excellent work in the face
o f adversity. He goes so far as to suggest that some managerial leaders even seek out disruption
as motivation for them to strive and achieve success by overcoming obstacles. By seeking and
surmounting struggles in work situations, these managerial leaders increase their feelings of
purpose and meaning in their work.
Study participants discussed an interest in striving to excel with the objective of
improving processes and results for stakeholders. Thus, managerial leaders are both responsive
to stakeholders and responsible for the processes and results o f the organization within the
context o f multiple stakeholders (Pless, Maak, & Jongh, 2011). These goals have an aspirational
quality of striving to improve work situations, increase employee abilities, and, ultimately,
benefit individuals’ lives. For example, one director indicated, “the library [is] the place where
[individuals have] every opportunity to leam, to explore, enjoy life, to improve. [It is] very open
and available.
Whereas responsibility and accountability to multiple stakeholders may be considered by
some as burdensome, the participants spoke o f their work in terms o f satisfaction, being
rewarding, and its purposeful nature. Researchers (e.g., Wrzesniewski, 2012) describe passion at
work as relating to work that has meaning for the individual and results in pleasure. This
description is shared by many o f the study participants. One director stated, “I’m at the end of

180

my career. It’s been 33 years, but every m o m en t... has been completely engaging and
energizing.” Others expressed similar appreciation for their work, including how a sense o f
purpose and meaning manifests as passion. One participant said, “It is a real joy and pleasure to
continue to grow and learn and develop as a leader. Actually it has been really rewarding.”
Another participant summed up her work by stating, “I have just loved every part o f it. I love the
people that I work with. I love the work that I do. I love the knowledge that I have gained. I love
my community. ... It is the best job.” One participant simply said, “I really love what I do.” This
type o f job satisfaction was echoed by all o f the participants.
Conclusion
When discussing their roles as public library directors, study participants emphasized
responsibility and accountability as primary motivations for their decisions and actions.
It is also important to note that thinking about and articulating responsibilities and
accountabilities are only starting points. Through actions that are congruent with articulated
values, a managerial leader demonstrates authenticity to others (Freeman & Auster, 2011).
Participants spoke of the importance o f congruence between values and action for various
stakeholders, including to be models for personnel and to demonstrate integrity with external
stakeholders. As one participant explained, “It is not just enough to be good and know what you
are about. You have to live the values and have to hold yourself accountable to them.” This
example points out the importance o f acting upon values and further hints at why acting in
accordance o f values is salient.
Study participants identified several stakeholders and responsibilities that are, at times, in
conflict with each other. In considering these conflicting stakeholder issues, values also are used.
They described using techniques, such as mindfulness, reflection, and self-regulation to make

181

choices rather than spontaneously acting on their impulses. They mentioned a sense o f purpose
and meaning that compels them to be responsible because o f the potential impact o f their work
on community members and library personnel. In this process they are informed by values
related to enhancing the lives o f others. These values deepen their sense o f responsibility and
purpose in their work. The following chapter discusses stakeholder responsibility and
accountability as it relates to core values and defining moments, and addresses how this study
contributes to the research in LIS and organizational management as well as suggests further
research on these topics.

CHAPTER SIX
CONCLUSION

Human values are deeply held beliefs that influence how individuals think, make
decisions, and behave (Rokeach, 1973). These values include core values, which are a set of
enduring principles (Schwartz, 1996; 2003; 2011; 2012), that inform an individual’s conduct,
choices, and desired end-states (Rokeach, 1973). Because values are so deeply held, at times
they are subconscious and used tacitly; however, at times, individuals consciously use them to
guide actions and/or achieve desired goals. As this dissertation demonstrates, regardless o f the
size o f library, staff, and community served, as well as the educational background o f the
directors, participants articulated common core values, defining experiences, and responsibilities.
The study shows how the participants navigated critical events in ways that clarified values and
defined how they are likely to respond to work situations in the future. In addition, this study
reveals how the role o f director influenced study participants to assume responsibilities relevant
to various stakeholders. Against this background, this chapter places the study findings within
the context o f related literature, suggests future research, and discusses how this study
contributes to the relevant research literature.
Personal Values
Previous studies o f the personal values o f librarians used survey instruments to identify
personal values priorities. For instance, in one study (Bryan, 1952) public librarians indicated a
priority for the arts, music, and literacy over scientific and sociology. In other studies, librarians
rated personal values o f a theoretical, aesthetic (Douglass, 1957; Igwe, 1981), and social (Igwe,
1981) nature higher than they did economic, political (Douglass, 1957; Igwe, 1981), and

187

religious (Igwe, 1981) values. In addition, values associated with self-respect and freedom were
considered more important than those related to comfort, pleasure, and security (Yerkey, 1980).
While the studies referenced may be helpful in imagining the personality o f a typical librarian in
the mid to late 20

tVi

century, the scant research on personal values provides little definitive

understanding o f specific core values, their relation to professional values, and their current
application in libraries. This study fills that gap by addressing these topics.
This study is the first published study in library and information science (LIS) to use the
Schwartz Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQIV) (Schwartz, 1996) to identify core values of
managerial leaders (library directors). This instrument, comprised o f 10 basic human
motivational values, reveals three specific common motivations among the participants: selfdirection, benevolence, and universalism. Self-direction (e.g., independent thought, privacy,
curiosity, and learning) (Schwartz, 1996; 2003; 2011; 2012) aligns with the professional values
(Gorman, 2000) o f intellectual freedom, privacy, and learning and literacy. Benevolence
(enhancing the welfare o f people in frequent contact (e.g., family, friends, community)) and
universalism, (the understanding, appreciation, and tolerance for all people and nature) relate to
the values o f service and equity o f access (Gorman, 2000). Thus, although the PVQIV was
designed for more general use, participants identified values through use o f the instrument that
align with service, equal access, intellectual freedom, and other values o f the library profession.
Along with identifying core values using the PVQIV, this study used narrative inquiry to
probe life stories that clarified values. Similar to other research on life stories (e.g., Bennis &
Thomas, 2007; Dahlvig & Longman, 2010; Flanagan, 2002; M ackoff & Wenet, 2001), in this
study, participants self-identify core values they use in their work by discussing formative
experiences, work situations, and how the role o f public library director has changed their values

188

priorities. Through this mosaic o f stories and descriptions, a pattern o f commonly held and
specific core values emerged. Participants described values o f honesty and integrity, respect,
fairness and equity, loyalty, learning and adaptability, and responsibility, regardless o f their
background and level and type o f education. The values o f respect, loyalty, and responsibility are
associated with benevolence (Schwartz, 1996; 2003; 2011; 2012), the values o f equity and
fairness with universalism, and the value o f learning with self-direction. Because study
participants came to libraries from various backgrounds, not always having a graduate degree in
library and information science, this research indicates that these participants are drawn to work
in libraries because the profession’s values align with their core values, formed in youth and
broadened through library work.
Further Research on Core Values Identification
Further LIS research with the PVQIV might indicate the extent to which other library
managerial leaders share the motivational values o f benevolence, self-direction, and
universalism, and the more specific core values o f honesty and integrity, respect, fairness and
equity, loyalty, learning and adaptability, and responsibility. Specifically, the PVQIV could be
administered to directors and other librarians across multiple countries, with various ethnic
groups, with those o f different generations, and with those serving in different types o f libraries
and in management positions within libraries. However, such research would have to take into
account national cultures and other issues. Such an administration o f the PVQIV in LIS,
grounded in national cultures and related perhaps to the GLOBAL leadership research (House,
Javidan, Hanges, & Dorfman, 2002), could indicate if these three motivational values, found in
common among the study participants are more broadly shared across the profession. Similarly,
a librarian-specific values identification instrument could be developed that may affirm to what

189

extent values, such as integrity and respect, are shared across the sectors previously identified for
PVQIV research. That instrument might be linked to the instrument used in the GLOBAL
research.
This study’s finding about core values aligning with professional values raises questions
about how individuals decide to join, and to remain, in the library profession. Specifically, are
certain individuals who hold the strong values o f self-direction, benevolence, and universalism
more likely to choose work in libraries, or is the profession a more complex tapestry of
individuals and values? The fact that study participants indicate their formative values align with
the values o f the profession indicates that professional training may need less focus on adoption
o f professional values and more emphasis on how personal, core values may aid library
managerial leaders in upholding professional values in practice.
This study affirms the importance o f investigating the core values o f managerial leaders
in order to improve how those values are used in practice. Several directors’ defining moments
related to a values conflict of loyalty to individual staff and responsibility for organizational
outcomes. In all cases, the participants prioritized their responsibility to the community and
taxpayers over individual personnel loyalties. With many o f the participants, this was a defining
decision, which suggests that others in directorships may face this conflict o f loyalties. Further
research is needed to indicate to what extent internal and external loyalties to stakeholders are
major values conflicts in public libraries and how these conflicts are resolved.
Public Library Director Core Values in Practice
Whereas previous studies identified librarian personal values using values tests (Bryan,
1952; Douglass, 1957; Igwe, 1981; Yerkey, 1980), this research extends beyond values
identification to understand how personal values influence work and how the work experiences

190

o f public library directors inform their values priorities. This study concludes that core values
play a primary role in informing the work o f study participants, whether they are consciously
aware o f and intentionally using them, or whether these values operate at a sub-conscious or
intuitive level o f influence. The assertion that personal values are either instilled at a deeper level
or reprioritized by defining moments (Bennis & Thomas, 2007) is supported by this study. Study
participants described critical incidents and defining experiences as either instilling core values
established in formative years or shifting values priorities.
Related to formative values, such as honesty and respect, this study shows that
participants apply these values across the organization, in many contexts, and with a variety of
library stakeholders. For example, participant stories revealed they place a high priority on
respect when they interact with personnel, governing authorities, and other stakeholders. In
addition, they instruct their employees to interact respectfully with library users; they establish
policies directed toward respectful library use and conduct, and they are respectful when
engaging in conflict resolution. Some participants discussed how intellectual freedom, the right
for any person to pursue any subject, is fundamentally an issue o f respect for every individual’s
intellectual inquiry process. Thus, respect manifests in many ways, including tolerance,
particularly in the managerial leadership position, in which public library directors are
responsible for engaging with a broad array o f stakeholders with whom they do not always agree.
Participants identified honesty as a value instilled in childhood and applied in their role as
public library director through integrity, transparency, and accountability. Jordan (2012) states
that integrity in public library directorship is synonymous with honesty and involves consistently
following the professions’ code o f ethics and being a role model for others. She views
accountability and credibility as separate attributes. However, in this study the directors

191

discussed honesty, integrity, transparency, and accountability as conceptually linked, indicating
that, although honesty may be a personal value, they apply honesty in work through consistent
and cohesive words and behaviors (integrity), open reporting practices (transparency), and
rigorous evaluation and reporting (accountability). Participants discussed these interrelated
values o f honesty, integrity, accountability, and transparency as one notion that applies at various
levels throughout their organizations and in their communities.
In previous research, public library directors, while not specifically asked about values,
identified integrity as a primary personal attribute (Hemon, Powell, & Young, 2003; Jordan,
2012) for public library directors. However, these studies did not examine how directors practice
integrity, why it is important, or where they learn the skills and importance o f integrity. This
study contributes to the literature by identifying, through participant stories, how integrity relates
to the formative value o f honesty and truthfulness as well as congruency in doing what they say
they are going to do, behaving ethically, being transparent about library activities, and being
accountable to multiple stakeholders. Several participants stated that they conduct their work
with transparency and accountability in order to act with integrity and be responsible to various
stakeholders. Some participants described systems they established to demonstrate
accountability, while others provided instructive stories o f situations in which they chose to be
honest and direct in difficult situations. Each o f these aspects of integrity requires more
exploration to understand fully how integrity is integrated into the work o f public library
directors and others in the library profession.
In addition, this study raises awareness o f issues when integrity, honesty, and
accountability are not present in the public library setting. Previous research (Snyder, 2006;
Snyder & Hersberger, 1997) reveals situations in which library personnel mishandle funds for

192

personal gain, with the conclusion that financial and other misconduct may be prominent in the
public library setting. This study, while not confirming this conclusion, identifies integrity issues,
such as mismanagement o f funds, resources, and staff as indicated by four participants, three o f
whom stated that integrity issues o f previous directors were critical incidents that prompted
defining moments. Although the study population was small, the fact that 25% o f the participants
described significant issues with previous library directors indicates an area for more research.
Certainly, the combination o f stories highlighting the importance o f integrity and the lack o f it
raise questions about the extent o f integrity issues in public libraries. Indeed, if misconduct is an
issue and identifiable on a large scale, the profession needs to consider policy implications,
training curriculum, and ethical accountability measures.
This study also found that participants shared common values conflicts, including
situations in which they chose integrity for library services over loyalty to employees. When
employees were not performing as the director instructed, participants described various methods
to resolve the issues, yet ultimately when employees were not performing satisfactorily, they
either left or were fired. Employee issues took months or years to resolve, and the participants
described them as defining conflicts because they, ultimately, chose an ongoing commitment to
organizational integrity and responsibilities, specifically to the overarching priority o f providing
high quality services and/or accountability to the public.
Study narratives highlight how values are reinforced or reexamined by defining moments.
This process gave the study participants a stronger sense o f commitment and confidence, which
confirms other research showing that defining moments increase the hardiness and values
commitment o f managerial leaders (Bennis & Thomas, 2007). During the narrative inquiry
process, for example, several directors described initiating change and persisting even when they

193

encountered resistance. When they were new to the directorship, or responded to external
changes in the environment, study participants mentioned being responsible for meeting the
needs of community members and leading organizational change. Resistance from library
personnel and other stakeholders created values conflicts in which self-directed library directors
chose changes in services over loyalty to employees.
In the Schwartz values model (1996; 2003; 2011; 2012) self-direction and openness to
change are contrary to more conservative values o f maintaining tradition, conforming to societal
priorities, and maintaining security. While all participants scored high in self-direction, they
scored conservative values low, with tradition being the lowest. Further probing through
narrative inquiry indicates that, although the participants initiated change within their
organizations and in the communities, some regulate their efforts with self-control due to a sense
o f responsibility to a wide variety o f stakeholders in the community and their public persona as
the library director. Thus, while some values are core, participants, to varying degrees, described
balancing their core values preferences with those related to maintaining relationships with
stakeholders. The participants described this as a responsibility a public library director
undertakes to self-regulate when considering the needs o f library stakeholders.
Further Research on Core Values and Work
Further research is needed to understand how work experiences expand an individual’s
commitment to core values, and how these values evolve within the work environment. Although
this study points to strategies, such as reflection, insight, and persistence, that contribute to
meaningful understanding o f and commitment to core values in various situations, more study is
needed to understand fully this complex human process. For example, research could ask
participants to use diaries or calendars to record values use, with the intent o f documenting

194

values development within the work context. These daily reflections could also reveal other
sources o f values prioritizations such as influence o f mentor values on the values o f participants.
Longitudinal analysis o f core values o f first-year public library directors might also shed
light on this complex process o f values strengthening and reprioritization. These probing
methods over a longer timeframe or with more in-depth life-story documentation may clarify
under what circumstances one chooses to commit to existing values at a deeper level and when
one chooses to shift values priorities.
Further study o f personal and professional values use in public libraries may also include
case study methods. Using case studies, investigators gather and examine evidence from various
data sources, including other members o f the organization. These processes allow for an
examination of multiple perspectives within the organization, including those o f personnel, board
members, library users, and other stakeholders. Through case studies, an investigator could probe
these perspectives and incorporate written communications, policies, and other organizational
documentation, and observation. In this way, case studies offer a richer portrait o f what and how
personal values are being used and reduce data bias associated with self-interest and self­
protection during participant reporting.
Professional Values Priorities
As with librarians in other studies (Burd, 2003; Dole, Hurych, & Koehler, 2000; Foster &
McMenemy, 2012), study participants identified service delivery as the primary professional
value and purpose o f the library. Whereas the previous studies used surveys to determine this
professional values priority, this study’s use o f narrative inquiry illustrates how public library
directors frame the professional value o f service as it relates to other professional values. For
example, all participants articulated a strong sense o f responsibility to provide high quality

195

service to those using the library, and several stated the importance o f ensuring equitable service
to all people in the community. Yet, study interviews revealed that underlying the stories of
library service was the deeper motivational value, namely the professional value o f enabling
“every person in the community serviced to continue her or his education, to become more
knowledgeable, and to live the life o f the mind in the way in which she or he chooses” (Gorman,
2000, p. 29). For example, one participant summed up the primary motivation o f library service
in this way, “I work in libraries because I believe they change people’s lives. Everything we do
is directed towards that overall goal o f making libraries an essential part o f people’s ability to
live, to prosper, to grow intellectually, and to be in a better place than they would be if we didn’t
have them [libraries].” This example represents the sentiment o f all o f the participants. In
essence, providing high quality service is important as a desired behavioral value (Rokeach,
1973) that is used to achieve the more aspirational desired end-state o f providing learning
experiences that improve people’s lives.
Along with the professional value o f service, in two stories community members
challenged library materials, which compelled participants to defend intellectual freedom. Yet,
the underlying value each participant described was the importance o f free and open access so
that anyone could learn what he or she intrinsically seeks to know. Participants described
intellectual freedom as the mechanism to ensure intrinsic learning as the end result. Thus, the
personal and professional value o f intrinsically motivated learning compelled the directors to
uphold values, such as effective, friendly service, intellectual freedom, privacy, and other
professional values. Study participants considered the long-term impact o f the work they do in
terms o f learning that can improve, and in some cases, transform those in the community. To this
end, they promote and defend professional values to further each unique community member’s

196

interest and intellectual needs. Thus, literacy and learning (Gorman, 2000) was the underlying
professional value motivating the directors in this study, whereas other professional values, such
as equity o f access, privacy, and intellectual freedom (Gorman, 2000), were described as critical
in achieving this deeply held and aspirational personal and professional value.
Further Research on Library Professional Values
Further research could clarify the extent to which the hierarchy o f professional values
identified in this study is shared by other library practitioners, both managers and non-managers.
For example, rather than simply listing the core values for participants to rank (as done in Burd,
2003; Dole, Hurych, & Koehler, 2000; Foster & McMenemy, 2012), researchers might provide a
set o f scenarios depicting different library situations in which specific values are implicit.
Participants would rank these scenarios from most to least salient, and the values in these
scenarios could be decoded to identify the values priorities.
Defining Moments
Previous researchers have investigated defining moments o f organizational leaders, such
as in business (Avolio & Luthans, 2006; Badaracco, 1997; Bennis & Thomas, 2002, 2007;
M ackoff & Wenet, 2001) and in higher education (Dahlvig & Longman, 2010; Flanagan, 2002).
These studies emphasize how critical incidents prompt defining moments by either affirming
core values at a deeper level or challenging those values in ways that result in changes to core
values priorities. This study expands on the research on defining life experiences by analyzing
how managerial leaders navigate them. The goal o f this analysis is to explore the components of
defining moments and identify paths from incident identification to resolution in order to
ascertain what and when the defining change occurred as well as how the individuals’ core
values informed that process.

197

Individuals presumably face critical life situations that do not prompt transformative
change. This study illuminates participant activities and thought processes that make these
situations defining, rather than simply commonplace interactions and experiences. Specifically,
participants use reflection and insight to gain a deeper understanding and new meaning that
informs identity and purpose. The analysis o f the 24 stories confirms other research (Avolio &
Luthans, 2006; M ackoff & Wenet, 2001) about how to navigate defining experiences. In
addition, this study introduces new ways o f viewing defining moments, as either realized in
retrospect, discovered through insight problem-solving, or navigated through conflict resolution.
This study confirms De Long’s (2012) finding that library managerial leaders identify
critical incidents primarily relate to job changes and subordinate staff performance problems. O f
this study’s defining moments, 54% occurred within the first year o f taking a new position and
29% o f critical incidents involving personnel issues. In addition, participants confirm that they
face critical issues related to managing change; this finding aligns with other research (e.g., Cope
& Watts, 2000). In addition, participants described critical incidents related to challenges to
library materials, library building projects, residual issues o f previous directors, and, in one case,
a natural disaster in the community. These findings point to the variety and complexity of
responsibilities and issues that public library directors face.
In response to critical incidents, the study participant discussed resolving the issues in
similar ways to those identified in other research (M ackoff&W enet, 2001). Specifically,
managerial leaders respond to critical incidents with reflection that leads to:
•

discovery o f new meaning and new perception

•

prioritization o f values that instills a sense o f purpose

•

confidence and self-efficacy for future situations

198

This study contributes to the literature on defining moments by identifying three distinct
paths o f defining moments: (1) a prompt and surprising moment o f clarity; (2) a dilemma that
requires extensive reflection over months or years prior to an insight; and (3) delayed action due
to complex relational conflicts and the need to coach or negotiate in order to achieve resolution.
Within each o f these responses, the components o f reflection, insight, action, confidence, and
commitment occurred; however, the path varied. This analysis also provides techniques for
reaching insight (e.g., discussion with trusted confidantes, research, and breaks in reflection,
such as through rest or sleep). In addition, two participants discuss how formative experiences in
libraries instilled a value so deeply that, when faced with opposition to their position on
intellectual freedom, they felt courage to persistence with their stance. These and other study
findings provide further understanding o f how the three paths (moments o f clarity, insight
problem-solving, and complex challenges involving relational conflicts) lead to defining
resolutions.
Further Research on Defining Moments
Further research is needed to determine the extent to which managerial leaders commonly
use moments o f clarity, insight problem-solving, and complex challenges involving relational
values conflicts, as described in chapter four. Do these three methods apply in libraries other
than public libraries? Do managerial leaders use additional methods? To what extent are the
commitments to the values consistently followed? How does persistence in pursuing a chosen
path relate to courage at times o f stakeholder scrutiny?
In addition, further research could clarify how various critical incidents and life
experiences result in more confidence, values clarity, and purpose. Through an understanding of
the various components and paths of defining life experiences, managerial leaders in libraries

199

may be more alert and aware o f these situations and intentional about how to resolve them. The
identification o f paths to insight and the role o f courage, for example, may assist other
professionals in leveraging these techniques to attain more success with critical incidents.
Managerial Leadership
This study delved into values that are specific to the role o f the public library director.
These organizational leaders are responsible and accountable to a broad array o f stakeholders,
including employees, who affect or are affected by the organization (Freeman, 1984). In
considering the common themes related to how the participants approach personnel, several
leadership theories are relevant. For example, servant leadership (Greenleaf, 2002; Kouzes &
Posner, 2002) relates to, among other things, the managerial leader’s responsibility to understand
the developmental needs o f personnel and use modeling, training, and improvement o f work
conditions to support them in working effectively. In addition, the servant leader articulates
inspirational values and a vision that influences workers to excel as they accomplish the
organizational mission and move beyond self-interest. Study participants described modeling
behaviors based on values they prioritize for personnel, listening to and encouraging employee
contributions, and leveraging opportunities to challenge and improve employee abilities. Several
study participants also discussed the role o f leadership as articulating a vision and clearly
articulating organizational values.
Authentic leadership (Avolio & Gardner, 2005) may apply as managerial leaders use
their self-awareness o f values and their commitment to integrity to act with authenticity.
Freeman and Auster (2011) posit that acting authentically requires knowing one’s values and
acting on them; this involves being responsible in relationships with stakeholders, understanding
how the past informs the self, and clarifying future aspirations. In this study, several participants

200

reported that reflecting on values, such as integrity, is foundational to their managerial leadership
style. All participants discussed how being in the study benefited them by allowing them to
reflect on their values, the meaning o f their work, and the way they work. Further research is
needed to understand how the use of personal values by managerial leaders in libraries relates to
the theoretical notions o f authentic leadership. To what extent do theories, such as servant
leadership and authentic leadership capture the views o f managerial leaders as they consider
subject o f leadership? In addressing this question, further research should consider the following
section.
Responsible Leadership Theory
Although servant leadership and authentic leadership theories involve strategies that
participants described as using in their work, these theories center primarily on internal
organizational activities between leader and follower (Pless & Maak, 2011). However, study
participants described a sense o f community responsibility as the underlying motivation for
many o f their activities, including their interaction with library personnel. They also expressed
feelings of responsibility to stakeholders outside the organization. For this reason, the theory of
responsible leadership (RL) may be better suited for further investigation with library
managerial leaders.
RL is an emerging leadership theory among business and academic leadership theorists in
response to unethical leadership, which has resulted in environmental crises, such as oil spills;
social crises (e.g., in sweat shop industries); and economic crises (e.g., 2007-2009 economic
recession) (Freeman & Auster, 2011; Pless & Maak, 2011).7 Whereas other leadership theories
focus on how the managerial leader supports personnel, such as employee skills development,
7 In 2010, the first international conference on responsible leadership was hosted in Pretoria, South Africa
(Pless & Maak, 2011). A special issue of the Journal o f Business Ethics (2011) was devoted to RL; and a
recent monograph addresses the subject (Badaracco, 2013).
201

RL defines organizational personnel as only one stakeholder group among many. RL is valuecentered and focused on relationships and outcomes for a broad array o f stakeholders impacted
by a business; these stakeholders include company shareholders, customers, and the community
served, as well as groups representing broader social and environmental impacts (Pless & Maak,
2011). In other words, the managerial leader’s role is to coordinate and cultivate outside
relationships, while focusing on growing the talent within their organization. In RL, the
managerial leader makes intentional and principled decisions based on values, and uses influence
and power to pursue meaningful ends that are motivated by societal values, such as
environmental sustainability and community well-being (Pless & Maak, 2011).
Within the narrative inquiry process, participants described the value o f responsibility as
integral to how they engage with various stakeholders (e.g., library personnel, library users,
governing authorities, community members and organizations, taxpayers). Participants stated
that, in their role as public library director, they consider the interests and needs o f these various
stakeholders when they make library decisions. In addition, they discussed conflicts among
stakeholders and the need for self-regulation in interacting with them. Pless and Maak (2011)
suggest a balance among responsibilities toward stakeholders in order to manage competing
interests. In this study, participants identified the motivational value o f responsibility to a
multitude o f stakeholders without clear delineation o f priorities among them.
Further Research on RL in Libraries
This study raises awareness o f the crucial role that accountability and responsibility play
in the work o f public library directors. RL offers opportunity for investigation, including
research to identify the full range of stakeholders that affect and are affected by libraries, and
which stakeholder responsibilities are priorities in various contexts. In addition, further research

202

might reveal to what extent the RL theory aligns with activities and motivations o f library
managerial leaders. Do these leaders portray leadership within the context o f values and
stakeholders? If so, how does this approach manifest in their work?
Further research also is needed to clarify how library managerial leaders and their
employees perceive their organizational responsibilities and activities. For example, library
directors and personnel could engage with instruments used in other RL studies, such as surveys
that reflect participant views o f managerial leaders’ actions, perceptions o f managerial leaders’
ethical and proactive behaviors toward external stakeholders, employee pride in and satisfaction
with the organization, and employee retention patterns (Doh, Stumpf, & Tyman, 2011). This
research could further expand on this study’s conclusion that public library directors consider
their responsibilities to various stakeholders to be a fundamental motivating aspect o f their work.
Summary of Research Agenda
Further research may determine if the common themes o f core values, critical incidents,
and defining moments shared by the study participants apply more broadly to other public library
directors. In addition, the topic may have broader interest for directors o f academic libraries,
others working in public administration, and managerial leaders in the private sector.
Specifically, the values identifications from the PVQIV (Schwartz, 2012) combined with
narrative inquiry provide a rich context in which to understand how managerial leaders use
values at work and how work changes their values priorities. Additional research applying these
methodologies may indicate the extent to which others in the library profession, such as new
librarians, select these values rather than values motivations o f tradition, security, conformity, or
self-enhancement values, such as achievement or power. Given that new librarians are entering
into a new profession, this research could clarify if barriers are likely to be prevalent with them.

203

In addition, the study results relied on the self-reporting o f the participants both through
the self-selected results o f the PVQIV and the narrative inquiry process, which produces a
snapshot in time o f their consideration o f their values, defining moments, and responsible
managerial leadership behavior. The results could be probed by means o f case studies that
provide data from different stakeholders, such as employees, governing authorities, and others in
the community.
Because the organizational leader’s values influence the organizational values and culture
(Schein, 2010), further research could determine how specific values, such as integrity, respect,
and responsibility, are adopted and applied by personnel and embedded into the library culture.
In addition, such research would contribute to the understanding o f how public library directors
introduce, maintain, and evaluate organizational values among personnel in an effort to solidify
their preferred organizational culture. This research could probe the various values within an
organization as they relate to the culture o f the library.
Conclusion
Public library directors in this study prioritize benevolence, self-direction, and
universalism. Schwartz (1996; 2003; 2011; 2012) defines these basic motivational values to
include:
•

enhancing the welfare o f those with whom one is in frequent contact

•

independent thought and action

•

understanding, appreciating, and protecting the welfare o f all people

This study contributes to the values research by illustrating how these values manifest in
work. Specifically, while Schwartz (2012) indicates these values are motivationally distinct, in
library practice they are interrelated as the motivational value o f enhancing the intellectual (self­

204

regulation) welfare o f others includes library users and personnel (benevolence) and everyone in
the community (universalism). This desired end-state combines the three distinct motivational
values identified by Schwartz, thus extending the understanding o f the interplay between these
values.
The value o f enhancing the intellectual abilities o f others instills a sense o f passion as
library directors strive to meet various stakeholder learning interests, including those o f library
users and employees. Some directors break rules and overlook lost book fees to promote
intellectual pursuits. Others strongly defend intellectual freedom and equal access to information
for all. Findings indicate that, although these public administrators feel responsibility and
accountability, the motivation is intrinsic and grounded in a human-centered perspective o f
encouraging learning for all.
Public library directors face challenges and navigate complex issues to provide for a
broad array o f stakeholders. Understanding values use and development is integral to effective
work. Through the reflective process o f identifying values with both the PVQIV and
recollections of defining moments, participants gained a stronger understanding o f their values
formation and development. They expressed gratitude for being in the study and having the
opportunity to reflect more deeply and find more meaning from their values.
Study findings have implications for library directors, regardless o f the stage in their
careers. The life stories reveal several stages in the position in which values are tested and
leveraged. Particularly when new to a directorship or facing change, critical incidents are likely
to occur. These events challenge values and aid in the director defining the core values that
matter most for them and the organization. These situations clarify the director’s sense o f self
and identity within the context o f various library stakeholders.

205

As directors continue throughout their tenure in public libraries they may expand the use
o f formative values, such as integrity, respect, and loyalty. These values are operationalized with
stakeholders through techniques o f reflection, mindfulness, and self-regulation. This intentional
use o f these behavioral values improves effectiveness and self-confidence. At the same time,
directors focus on end-goal oriented values (equality, fairness, life-long learning) to inspire a
keen sense o f meaning, purpose, and passion in their work and the organization.
By the end o f their careers library directors who reflect on core values and defining
moments find this mental exercise elicits a deeper understanding o f the contributions they have
made to the library organization, the profession, and their communities. Participants in this
study who were reaching retirement stated that they may have managed situations by reacting to
various circumstances. It was not until a comprehensive reflection on these years o f effort that
they discovered the patterns and deeper contributions o f their work. Yet throughout these stages
in their careers values tacitly guided principled decision-making.
Core values are fundamental to the way individuals perform their duties because they
influence perceptions, decisions, and behavior. Because values are inherent some individuals
may use them unconsciously or without focus. This study raises awareness o f the importance o f
being mindful and intentional about values use at work. By reflecting on core values and
defining moments, others may gain deeper understanding o f the motivations that inform, and
indeed inspire, them in their work.
As managerial leaders deal with substantive issues, such as those associated with
managing change, and as communities select directors to move the library forward, the library
profession needs to acknowledge that values are an important component o f individuals and their
conduct; after all, values are critical motivators o f behaviors and attitudes. For this reason, it is

206

critical that future research goes beyond the study o f director attitudes, beliefs, and competencies
(see chapter one). As shown in this study, it is also important to identify how directors come to
hold the values they do, how their value priorities influence their behavior, attitudes, and actions,
and how work experiences modify values over time.
This research can be cast in the context o f the larger literature on values and extend the
insights gained from those studies. For example, public library directors, as public
administrators, navigate various stakeholder responsibilities and accountabilities o f their
positions. With the increased emphasis on authenticity and responsible leadership in other
professions, the motivation o f enhancing the welfare o f others offers a values perspective to be
explored further in the organizational development literature.
Managerial leaders in all professions face challenges to values as well as conflicts among
them. As this research emphasizes, organizational leaders may use mindfulness and self­
regulation to reduce the impact o f challenging situations, as well as reflection, insight, courage,
and persistence to resolve values conflicts in organizations. These techniques require additional
study in order to understand fully how they may be leveraged by organizational leaders
regardless o f industry.

APPENDIX A
Initial E-mail Message to Potential Participants
Hello,
Perhaps you have been alerted by <mutual colleague> that I would be contacting you.
I am a doctoral candidate at Simmons College conducting a dissertation on the core values o f
public library directors.
You have been identified as one o f only 15 library directors in the country to participate in this
study because o f your demonstrated success as a public library managerial leaders (including
Star Library recognition).
Process
• Values questionnaire (10-15 minutes)
•

Reflection on core values report and questions for interview (10+ minutes)

•

Telephone Interview - Your stories about your core values at work (60 minutes or less)

•

Review and expansion on your stories as you wish (optional)

I will call you within the next week to discuss the study and any questions you may have about
participation. If you are interested, we will schedule the telephone interview at that time as well
as logistics for the values questionnaire.
Please reply to this e-mail to let me know best days and times for a brief, 10 minute conversation
about the study. Alternatively, you could provide the contact o f your assistant with whom I can
schedule our phone meetings.
More on the research - Benefits & Risks to You
In previous research on values, leaders indicate that participating in the research helped them
find deeper meaning in their work because o f the opportunity to step back and reflect on their
leadership activities, defining moments, and their core values.
Along with this benefit, your participation in this research will lead to findings that may be
instructive to others in the library profession. Although research in other fields shows a clear link
between values and organizational effectiveness, the library field is lacking in this area and your
participation will help to highlight if and how core values inform public library leadership.
The process will include an in-depth telephone interview in which we explore your core values.
To prepare for this informal conversation, you will receive guiding questions along with your
custom values profile based on the results o f your values questionnaire. The interview itself will
be approximately 60 minutes in length and include you telling stories about defining moments in
your work.

225

Your confidentiality is o f the utmost importance and several processes will be in place so that
your contributions will remain anonymous.
Participation in this study is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time without any
reciprocity.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to speaking with you to discuss this study and
your interest in participating. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely,
Sharon Morris
Doctoral Candidate, Simmons College

APPENDIX B
E-mail to State Library Liaisons

Dear <Name o f colleague>.
Hope this e-mail finds you well. As you may know, I am working on a dissertation and have a
favor to ask in this regard. Although I do not know the people I have selected to interview for
this research, you know one. I have identified <Name o f p a rtic ip a n t as a potential participant
and one o f only 15 in the country with whom I will be recruiting.
Because o f the small study size, I am reaching out to my colleagues, including you, seeking
assistance in recruiting these 15 participants. Would you be willing to assist in my recruiting
<first name> to be in the study? This would be a tremendous favor to me but also will help
acquire a diverse group that includes your state.
Below is a draft e-mail I composed for you to edit and send. If you could let me know whether
this is something you are willing to do or not, that would be helpful for my own records and
tracking. In either case, I thank you for your consideration.
Draft e-mail

Hello <name>,
I want to introduce you to an opportunity that is fairly unique and may be o f interest. My
colleague Sharon Morris is working on a dissertation and is interested in having you participate.
I told her I would contact you to let you know about this study and to also indicate the value o f
being involved. In my work with Sharon, I know her to be a person o f integrity and
thoughtfulness. I believe this opportunity could be o f benefit to you and also could have positive
implications fo r the library profession. My understanding is that Sharon will be contacting you
by e-mail and phone. I encourage you to consider participating as your time and interests allow.
Best wishes,
<your name>
Again, I thank you for considering this request. Below is a brief introduction to my study.
Library directors establish the organization’s values and vision, instill these values in the
workforce, and address values conflicts as they arise, such as those related to user privacy versus
security, intellectual freedom challenges, and equal access strains with limited resources. Despite
the salience o f values in public library work, no study, until this one, has investigated how public
library directors employ values in their work. This study examine the core values o f public
library directors, how their life experiences shaped those values, how these values inform their
managerial leadership activities, and whether and how their library experiences alter their values
priorities over time.
227

The study will be o f interest to library directors, public and otherwise, interested in
values, how values impact their work, and how core values can be leveraged to accomplish the
organization’s mission and vision. It may also be o f interest to directors wanting to reflect on
their own values and how to leverage those values in their everyday work. Those who oversee
public library directors, including library board members, may gain ideas for assessing
candidates for library director positions as well as evaluating the directors they do hire. This
study may also be o f interest to graduate programs in LIS that include coverage o f leadership
values, as well as library leadership institutes that address values identification, awareness, and
implementation. Because values are universal, library professionals in other countries may also
be interested in the study, and consider implications in their own countries. Finally, state library
staff who work with public library directors may gain insight into how values impact public
library directors and use those insights to provide coaching, support, and training for library
directors and boards.

APPENDIX C
Talking Points for the Introductory Phone Call

Introduction
Hello, I am Sharon Morris. Did you receive my e-mail about the study I am conducting on
personal values?
Do you have a few minutes to talk with me now or is there a better time I may reach you?
I wanted to explain the study a bit more and why you have been selected among only 15 out o f
nearly 9,000 public library directors.
Selection
Your library has been a star library for multiple years which is a tremendous accomplishment.
Along with that, I have been reviewing your website to learn more about your library and the
leadership you provide. Your success within your community and the quality o f your image
indicate strong leadership.
Study Description
The study involves four basic activities.
1. You will receive a questionnaire to fill out. This typically takes about 10 minutes. I can
send this electronically or via mail. Do you prefer a print version or something online?
2. Then, I will send your customized report o f your values based on the questionnaire you
have filled out. You will review this report, reflect on the results as one way to consider
your core values and the questions for the interview.
3. We will have a telephone conversation that will take no more than one hour. In that
conversation, you will tell stories about two defining moments, talk about your core
values, and discuss leadership. I will send questions to you ahead o f time so you may
prepare. Because we will be exploring your experiences and delving deeper I may ask
other clarifying questions to get more specific information.
4. You will receive a transcript o f the interview which you may review and revise before I
write the findings and analysis.
To confirm that your privacy is secure, I will send you a copy o f the summary findings o f your
section o f the study. This will be a final opportunity for you to confirm the information and also
confirm that the depiction does not reveal information that might identify you to others.
Any questions?
May we schedule our 60 minute interview?
Let me wrap up by letting you know the next steps. I will be sending the questionnaire to you by
next week. I will also send you a reminder e-mail o f our interview time and include the
questions.

229

I am grateful and excited that you are going to be participating in this research. I look forward to
our next conversation. Also, if you need to reach me, my contact will be on all the information I
send.

Semi-Structured Interview Questions
Please review the values report based on the questionnaire you filled out. The core values are
listed first and you might identify other, more specific values you consider to be core.
For the interview, you will tell stories o f two defining moments in your work as public library
director. To clarify terms, some definitions are below.
•

Your values serve as the lens through which you view the world and make choices. They
are deeply held beliefs o f what is fundamentally important to you and are guiding
principles for your thinking, decisions, and behaviors. Core values are those deepest held
values which you consider to be non-negotiable and when you act from your core values,
you gain a strong sense o f purpose. Managerial leaders often feel most effective when
they use their core values in their work.

•

•

•

A defining moment is a clarifying turning point in your life; one in which a critical event
occurs that tests and clarifies your values. A critical event could be a positive or negative
experience and typically is unexpected and involves a moment o f insight, or an epiphany,
that clarifies a new path or strengths resolve for the future.
A defining moment results in a change significant enough to alter or deepen core values
and instill a deeper sense of purpose and commitment. Along with these critical events,
and your responses to them, we will explore any moments o f insight, or epiphanies, and
the resulting commitment to core values.
In considering which defining moments to tell stories about, choose two from your work.
These could be related to critical events with governance (board, administration),
supervision (staff), or experiences with the public either in the library or in the
community. In addition, please consider at least one defining moment in which two or
more values were in conflict (either within you or in relating to others or with
professional values).

(This section will contain the questions about defining moments, core values formation and use
in work to evoke stories o f people and experiences related to values.)
THANK YOU
