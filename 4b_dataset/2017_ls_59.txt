Abstract
Twenty three in-depth qualitative telephone interviews were conducted in this multiple
case study with instruction librarians at eight four-year colleges and universities. Snowball
sampling was used to select instruction librarian, information literacy department head and
administration participants employed at institutions recognized by Association of College and
Research Libraries for exemplary information literacy best practices: information programs. The
questions researched in this dissertation were: How are selected four-year colleges implementing
exemplary information literacy courses? How do exemplary four-year college library information
literacy courses implement the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy in Higher Education (2016)? How do exemplary four-year colleges and
universities implement digital literacy and the six frames of the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)?
The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the Framework
for information literacy for higher education (2016) were used as a foundation for this study. A
conceptual framework was built in this study around information literacy historical underpinnings
and five major national educational reports that were submitted to Congress between 1983 and
1989. These reports accelerated the information literacy agenda in institutions. The major study
findings suggested that information literacy programs in institutions were most successful when
the library’s program was supported by the institution’s administration. Successful information
literacy course and program implementation in all eight institutional settings were dependent on
the collaborative arrangements made between the instructional librarians and the faculty. Online
information literacy courses were not common at the eight institutions. Information literacy
instruction was blended and information literacy tutorials provided to students had onlinecomponents. Instruction librarians were using best practices in six areas that directly related to the
development and design of the information literacy course: in their reference interactions with

students, in choosing information literacy and teaching and learning models that would fit their
institution’s programs, in the development of information literacy curriculum, in curriculum and
program administration procedures and in assessing their information literacy courses and
programs. Findings also indicated that although there was a great deal of anecdotal evidence that
instructors provided that their students were information literate when they graduated, and that
they were lifelong learners, no institutions had implemented tests for seniors that determined
whether they were graduating information literate.

Abstract
Twenty three in-depth qualitative telephone interviews were conducted in this multiple

sampling was used to select instruction librarian, information literacy department head and
administration participants employed at institutions recognized by Association of College and

The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the Framework

Acknowledgements

All Praise and Thanks to God for His Grace and Aid with completing this dissertation.
To my family, thank you very much for your support of my efforts. Nathaniel,
thank you for your encouragement when I was feeling low and for helping me to rally
after the many times that there was frustration, tears or pain. Thank you for your help
with preparing my photocopies for my proposal defense. I would not have finished in
time without your help. Chijike, thank you very much for your patience, and for the many
times you came to my aid when there was a computer problem that I know I should have
been able to fix. You were so kind to work on it and fix it for me. Thank you for always
knowing what was wrong when I would shout for help or in frustration. You do not know
how much your support has meant to me over the years.
I want to say a very big thank you to each of the participants that were willing to
be interviewed as part of the study. Thanks for being willing to reschedule even when I
missed a meeting with you and for your interest in the study that I was doing and also its
outcome. I would never have been able to gather the information I did about each of your
colleges or learn so much about each of your information literacy programs, if you had
not been collaborative to a fault, kind by providing me with links and resources and
patient with me even when I often did not understand what you were explaining or when
I did ask the questions that you were not really wanting to answer. I have learned so
much from each one of you!! Thank you.
Dr. Talab, thank you for what you did for me. I am sorry that it was not possible
to finish this dissertation while you were still my advisor. I am very grateful to you for

xviii

your interest in me, for the years of direction and support that you gave me and for the
hurdles that you helped me to cross on my way to completing this dissertation. I wish you
every happiness at your retirement and in your future endeavors.
Dr. Mercer, may God bless you for being willing to take my dissertation and me
on here! Thank you so much for your strong guidance, for helping me to stay on course
and for your kindness and patience with me. This is the hardest task I have ever done in
my life. I am glad that I had the opportunity to work with you in order to complete it.
Dr. Carroll, thank you for believing in me from the beginning. Thank you for your
support and for your interest. Thank you for being willing to listen to me when I was
facing troubled situations and for your backing and encouragement. I would not have
been able to do this without you. Thank you for being there for me when I really thought
I was in jeopardy with this dissertation. It was so good to have one of my dissertation
committee be so caring and warm and kind. Thanks very much for your invitations to
your writing classes during the summer. Those helped me out because it kept me going
on with what I needed to do at the time. I very much appreciate the time you gave me,
because it was worthwhile even though it was at a distance and short. It still meant that I
still had your support! So thank you a thousand times!
Betsy Edwards, thank you very much for all your help with formatting my
dissertation. I really do appreciate all that you have done for me, to make my table of
contents, figures and tables work when they constantly would stop working, and I wasn’t
sure where to begin again. You definitely lightened my frustration a great deal. God bless
you!

Dr. Shalin Hai-Jew, thank you for all your help with NVIVO. That qualitative
program is definitely a bear! It took such a long time for me to get my head around it and
to figure out how it works. Your great class and your direction and support with NVIVO
were phenomenal.
Dr. Alysia Starkey, thank you very much for your patience with me and for taking
my in-opportune questions and phone calls during times when you were so busy, and yet
you were willing to help me out. I am grateful to you for helping me to understand the
dissertation writing process better and for being willing to be on my dissertation
committee of experts.
Caleb Puckett and Amy Fyn, thank you very much for being willing to serve on
my dissertation committee of experts at a distance. Your comments via email were very
helpful to me as I created and revised my interview questions for this dissertation. Caleb,
thank you so much for your expert information literacy advice and for being so
knowledgeable about the field. I appreciate how much time you spent helping me think
about research topics and research questions that could work for a dissertation. Thank
you too for all your interest, encouragement and personal support! All that you have done
for me is very much appreciated.
Dr. Karen Ohnesorge, thank you for your patience with me and more specifically
for your listening ear. Thank you for being willing to give me your time, especially when
I needed to talk to you about a hundred things! Thank you too for reading my early work,
and providing me with invaluable feedback and comments that I really needed to hear. I
appreciate your friendship, your interest, and your advice over the years and your
constant support. I am blessed to have you in my corner.

xx

To my friends, Dr. Amber Reagan-Kendrick and Jan Lee. A big thank you to you
both for the hours you listened to my complaints and encouraged me. For your interest in
my work and for the many discussions that we have had over the past few years about
staying on task, not giving up and getting this project done. Thank you for being there for
me when the bottom almost fell out of my project and I almost had no recourse. Your
encouragement made me think again about my situation and be sure that I picked up the
pieces and continued on. God bless you both for your thoughtfulness and kindness.
Dr. Bob Brill and Dr. Ruth Entwhistle, thank you for your prayers,
encouragement, understanding of my limitations and for your interest in my work. Your
support and that of the members of Brother Jacoba Secular Franciscan Order is very
much appreciated.
Thank you very much to the members of my Dissertation Committee: Dr. Debbie
Mercer, Dr. Doris Carroll, Dr. Be Stoney and Dr. Deepak Subramony for your patience,
interest, candid direction and support.

Dedication

I dedicate this dissertation to my family, my husband, Nathaniel Dikeogu and my
son, Chijike Dikeogu. I acknowledge that this ten-year feat of study would not have been
possible without your caring and support of my endeavors, and the hours of time you
spent fixing my laptop computer when it was not working correctly. May God richly
bless you both!

Prologue
When this dissertation was begun, the researcher had worked as a library director in an
academic library for seven years. She had started work in an academic library setting after
spending her early professional years as a high school English teacher and school librarian, and a
public librarian.
Teaching in a smaller academic college as a member of the faculty, and being actively
involved in the creation of a blended information literacy course at her College, the researcher
was determined to conduct research on an information literacy research topic that would provide
useful information to aid and bolster a fledgling information literacy program. The researcher
went through several information literacy topic scenarios, all of which were not the right topics
for a dissertation.
Choosing to research how exemplary information literacy programs had developed and
designed their programs was a topic that was suggested to the researcher, thus she cannot claim
that she was the originator of this idea or the one who made the final decision about what the
actual dissertation topic would be. She had considered and offered several topic suggestions, but
these had all been rejected. Initially, exploring this topic, it did appear that it could be viable.
Exploring in depth, the topic began to resonate with the researcher because she had many
questions about information literacy programs at other colleges and universities and how these
were being conducted. She was particularly interested in the universities that had participated in
the American College and Research Libraries Best Practices Program, where they had become
exemplary programs that were somewhat celebrated in the field. After winning high acclaim for
the example they had set for other college information literacy programs, librarians at these
colleges literally reached celebrity status amongst their colleagues, being invited to present about
their information literacy successes to librarian-audiences across the country and publish a
multitude of articles about their information literacy pursuits in the literature.

xxiii

At first, the researcher asked what a smaller academic library would need to do as it
changed tactics, first teaching face-to-face, blended information literacy courses to designing and
developing courses online. Would the study be able to provide answers to that question? Then she
thought of how outcomes had been created for the course she was teaching and how important it
was to understand how other colleges and universities were interpreting those and assessing their
own outcomes in their courses. She wondered how the assessment procedures she and the
information literacy librarian had chosen would work out. Would students become information
literate after they had taken the library’s course? Or would they need more.
When she had the opportunity to craft the three main questions which were posed in the
study, she took it with both hands and then crafted about forty questions of her own which cut be
asked of participants in interviews. These questions were tempered down by three expert
information literacy specialists and in the end twelve questions remained.
Then, as luck would have it, the information literacy librarian hired to work with her
designing the information literacy program at her college, created a completely online
information literacy course in Blackboard, and now the researcher’s questions began to change.
She had not checked on this as being a fact, but she was convinced that all the large, exemplary
universities had to have online programs. If she had them at her small university library, then all
of them, if they were exemplary, had to have them and all she had to do now, was gather
information in this study about these online programs and transfer it to her own program. As a
result the College she worked at became The Site in the study. The Site remained the center of the
study, until the researcher came to realize that small and large universities functioned at very
different academic levels. Large institutions were organized differently, had very different
administrative and staffing structures and very different agendas from small colleges and
universities. Transferability and generalization was ludicrous. To simply compare or apply what
she had learned from large colleges and universities was impractical. Changing the guard, and

xxiv

finally making positive advances in the right direction toward finishing her research, The Site was
removed from the study.
The study that remains and that has been conducted and analyzed is timely, because it has
caught academic librarians at exemplary colleges on the cusp of experiencing a phenomenal
change in their professional lives, but more specifically in the information literacy field like
nothing ever seen before. It was definitely study-worthy because this is a study that cannot be
replicated because circumstances and situations affecting librarians, around the outgoing
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and then their rescinding, and
the encroaching presence of the Framework (2016) will never be the same. It is disappointing,
though, that it was not possible as part of this study, to interview students from exemplary
colleges and universities at that time during this study. Would it have been possible to determine
whether the librarian experience at the time had any effect on their learning? It is not possible to
say, and it would be too late now, but it would have been fascinating to discover the impact that
attendance in the integrated information literacy classes offered at exemplary universities in the
study were having on the learning experiences of students. Were these learning experiences
similar, or very different across colleges relating to the uniqueness of the programs they attended?
The best way to find out would be to study the many erudite studies that have been authored by
librarians from each of the universities in the study, around the time that these interviews were
conducted a year ago. But then even considering this as a possible study, would be impossible,
since each college emphasizes what is important to them in their research. But that could certainly
be the beginning of a new study to conduct in the future.

Chapter 1 - Information Literacy

Chapter Overview

This chapter includes the following topics of discussion: the history of
information literacy, the development and growth of information literacy courses in
colleges and universities, information literacy instruction changes, literacy
implementation in information literacy courses, the information literacy course, the
online information literacy course, exemplary information literacy courses, and the role
of the Association of College and Research Libraries best practices program in their
development. This chapter includes a description of the role of higher education
accreditation in the information literacy course implementation process, the purpose of
the study, research questions posed, significance, and delimitations of the study.

Background of the Issues: Why do this project?

The researcher had developed a new information literacy librarian position
because there was a real need for the creation of an information literacy course at the
university. Undergraduate students had to complete a group core research project in their
senior year, and librarians were aware that students struggled a great deal when working
in their groups to write their senior core papers. A student information literacy
assessment was conducted at the university that included a random sample of students
enrolled as freshman, sophomores, juniors and seniors. The findings included extremely

1

low information literacy scores and further that these might be connected to student
struggles with writing their research papers. The researcher worked with an information
literacy librarian to facilitate the design of an information literacy for-credit course that
would be taught to undergraduate students.
The researcher was a member of the Association of College and Research
Libraries and had heard about the Association’s exemplary information literacy program.
It made sense to investigate how libraries were applying the new Framework (2016) that
had just been developed and filed by the Association of College and Research Libraries
Board on February 2, 2015. During the process of writing this dissertation, on January 11,
2016, the Framework (2016) was adopted by the Association of College and Research
Libraries as an improvement on the Standards (2000) and it was then professionally
vetted (Association of College and Research Libraries, Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education, 2016).

Background of the Issues: Why attempt this research?

This research project was conducted because the researcher wanted a better
understanding of information literacy as it was taught at larger universities, but more
specifically in those institutions that were deemed exemplary by information literacy
instructors in the profession, specifically those who were members of the Association of
College and Research Libraries. Questions were in relation to why and how information
literacy was being taught at larger institutions, how the ACRL Standards (2000) and the
ACRL Framework (2016) were viewed and used in those institutions and what the
similarities and differences between larger and smaller institutions were in terms of
2

information literacy course and program structures. What had contributed to these
significant similarities and differences between institutions of different sizes when
teaching information literacy and why? Was it that smaller colleges claimed that they
were teaching information literacy as a means of writing remediation while larger
institutions were not? Instead, the larger universities emphasized teaching their students
to become student scholars and used information literacy instruction during orientation.
They then integrated information literacy into the disciplines to further develop the
student scholar and strengthen their students’ knowledge in relation to using scholarly
resources and understanding research.

Information in the Global Knowledge Economy

Samia Melhem (2014) described the global information society as one of “the big
ideas” of our time and defined it further as “connecting the world through information
and communication technologies (ICT’s)” thereby having “contributed to globalization”
that had then “shaped economies, transformed society and changed the history” of our
world (Melhem, 2014, Para.12).
At the World Summit for Information Society in Geneva, Switzerland in 2014, the
United Nations leadership identified eleven Millennium Development Goals which were
information and communication technologies targets, that were being worked on around
the world in United Nations and World Bank information and communication
technologies projects and that when met, would contribute to transforming our world into
an information society. The eleven targets are listed in Figure 1.1 below.

3

Leaders at the World Summit (2014) also identified four needs for improvements
to the information and communication technologies operations in the poorest countries, if
the information society were to be brought to the entire world. The first need identified
was that of creating better leadership mobilization in countries with United Nations
information and communication technologies projects, where local experts, governments
and technology leaders were asked to better collaborate and partner with information and
communication technologies leaders so that these projects would be more effective and
run more smoothly where they had been implemented. The second need was for the
inclusion of women in the information and communication technologies process, which
was still not happening because of the educational and entrepreneurship barriers women
still faced in many countries of the world. The third need was the requirement for all
countries to comply with international standards in the area of computer systems and
data. Finally, the fourth was that countries needed to be open to the enforcement of
cybersecurity policies, which would in turn protect the information and communication
technologies infrastructure “critical to building the skills for governments and society,”
though United Nations information and communication technologies projects in these
countries (Melhem, 2014, Para. 12).

The concepts underlying the information and communication technologies
projects driving the development of the global society, included knowledge management,
a concept that was developed in the 1990’s, alongside the knowledge management
movement which had started to emerge because of the global economy. "Knowledge”
management was defined by Koenig (2012) as “the process of capturing, distributing, and
effectively using knowledge." It “was a discipline that” promoted an integrated approach

5

to “identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing all of an enterprise's
information assets” (Koenig, 2012, Para.4), both online and on paper, that “included
databases, documents, policies, procedures, and previously un-captured expertise and
experience in individual workers" (Para.4). The knowledge management model described
by Koenig (2012) had concepts search strategy and browsing and exploration topics that
were allied to the tool literacies and search strategies that were taught to students by
instructors in information literacy classes. In the model described by Koenig (2012)
browsing and harvesting resources was important while harnessing resources and
collections and making connections were also considered to be important to knowledge
managers.
Rowley (2000), a professor at the School of Management and Social Science at
Edge Hill University College in the United Kingdom explained that organizations that
will succeed in the global information society were those that could identify value, create
and evolve their knowledge systems. Higher education institutions are identified as being
in the knowledge management business, since they were involved with the creation of
their knowledge assets, and need to be aware of their role in the community and to be
able to recognize their own intellectual capital. Universities participated in the
dissemination of information and knowledge, which were ever-changing, with facilities
like libraries contributing to both. Rowley (2000) suggested that it was important that as
knowledge management organizations, higher education institutions take appropriate
steps to develop, store, use and curate their knowledge systems, manage them as assets
within the organization and make them accessible through publishing, embedding,
knowledge transfer and participation in interdisciplinary decision-making processes to

6

the global community. Furthermore, Rowley (2000) stated that universities were
encouraged to network and share knowledge across international borders and that they
should also stay at the forefront of creating “converged library and information systems”
where systems driven structures could become more knowledge driven. “Knowledge
management for higher education in the global economy” required “strategic alliances on
the international arena and the creation of global knowledge repositories” (Rowley, 2000,
p.332) thereby, providing competitive advantage to these higher education institutions
that could share scholarly resources access with a myriad of national and international
stakeholders.
Bundy (2002) identified information literacy as a “whole-of-society and global
education issue” (p.126) that was directly connected to both the development of a global
society and to the management of knowledge in organizations such as higher education
institutions. Information literacy instructors working with students in these institutions
had the chance to prepare them to use technology in many ways to interact with and work
within the global society. Bundy (2002) also suggested that it was important to promote
information literacy because the free flow of ideas was a necessity in thriving democratic
nations and global economies. Bundy (2002) viewed information literacy as it was then
defined by the Australian Library and Information Association, as a prerequisite for
participative citizenship, social inclusion, the creation of new knowledge, personal
empowerment and lifelong learning (p.130).
Kutner & Armstrong (2012), information literacy librarians from the University
of Vermont believed information literacy librarians had “a unique role to play producing
information literate students equipped to be successful in a complex, twenty-first century

7

global society” (p. 24). According to Kutner & Armstrong (2012) information literacy
librarians must rethink what it means to prepare their students for the global society of
the 21st century. Thus, information literacy librarians are tasked with the presentation of
large-scale conversations to their students that include and are focused on the topics such
as internationalization and global learning. Information literacy in the global society was
about much more than just tool literacy and the development of college writing skills in
student learners. Information literacy librarians needed to address the intersection
between global literacy and information literacy by teaching holistic information literacy,
critical information literacy, a “deep information literacy” which encompassed
“additional context-based engagement with social, cultural, political and economic
contexts of information access, retrieval, use and creation” (Kutner & Armstrong, 2012,
p.25). Critical or holistic information literacy was defined as the type of information
literacy that incorporated not just the recurrent common information literacy themes, but
that also encompassed teaching students to be lifelong learners, and that empowered them
to be active in addressing cultural, racial and social inequities, redressing disadvantage
and in promoting social inclusion and well-being in the global information context.
Kutner & Armstrong (2012) also suggested that problem-based, interdisciplinary,
experiential and service-based learning were conducive to student learning and
engagement especially with complex global issues, and that instruction librarians should
endeavor to design curricula for their students along those lines that allowed them to
develop an “understanding of the greater societal and global contexts of information in all
its constructs” (p. 27).

Growth of Online Courses in Higher Education

The rise in online learning has led to the development and consideration of online
library instruction. The Online Learning at Private Colleges and Universities Council of
Independent Colleges: A Survey of Chief Academic Officers Report (Clinefelter &
Magda, 2013) was an online learning benchmarking survey of Chief Academic Officers
from Private Academic Colleges and University members of the Council of Independent
Colleges (CIC). The survey included Chief Academic Officers from small (fewer than
750 students); medium (750-1,499 students); large (1,500-2,250 students) to very large
(more than 2,250 students) private colleges, with 65% from non-profit and 35% from forprofit institutions. Ten percent of colleges and universities interviewed had no online
programs and had no plans to develop any such program. The colleges and universities
with online programs were categorized as extensive (having five or more fully online
programs), intermediate (having one to four fully online programs) and limited (no fully
online programs but planning to implement them). Fifteen percent of CIC colleges
offered extensive programs, 37% of CIC colleges offered intermediate programs and 48%
of CIC colleges offered limited programs. The study compared these findings with
American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) where 48% offered
extensive programs, 37% offered intermediate programs and 48% offered limited
programs. Colleges were also categorized according to the numbers of students they
allowed to take online courses. Colleges categorized as “open”, allowed 85% or more of
their student population to take online classes, while “non-selective” colleges allowed 7685% of their student population admittance to online programs, “selective” colleges
allowed 50-75% of their student population admittance to online programs and “very
9

selective” colleges allowed less than 50% of their student population admittance to their
online programs.
According to Clinefelter & Magda’s (2013) Online learning at private colleges
and universities the Council of Independent Colleges: A survey of Chief Academic
Officers report both CIC and AASCU colleges and universities were proud of their
instructional design and faculty development and self-identified these services as
“exemplary” because they were “focused on providing students with a high-quality
learning experience” (p. 10). Key findings from the study were that online faculty and
staff working at CIC Colleges, became centralized to “more easily coordinate the
development and operation of these new programs” (Clinefelter & Magda, 2013, p. 5),
with the traditional campuses of these colleges being responsible for marketing, advising
and enrollment. Table 1.1 describes the institutional online teaching models that were
implemented at institutions with online programs.

According to Clinefelter & Magda (2013) the most common courses being
offered online by CIC colleges in the study were in the fields of business, healthcare,
psychology and counseling, criminal justice and paralegal studies and education. Fifty
percent of colleges and universities in the study marketed their online courses nationally,
but only 10% of these colleges marketed their online courses internationally. This means
that there would be smaller numbers of online international students attending CIC
colleges and universities than students from the United States. One-third of colleges and
universities in the study charged a lower tuition for online courses. Online programs also
had a challenge with tracking revenues made from offering online courses. Seventy
percent of the colleges in the study offering online courses and programs stated that their
full-time faculty taught online courses as overload, teaching courses both online and faceto-face (in comparison only 30% of faculty teaching at American Association of State
Colleges and Universities (AASCU) taught online and face-to-face at their universities).
Two-thirds of the colleges and universities in the study that offered online programs
compensated their faculty additionally for developing online courses and programs and
also for teaching them. Sixty-seven percent of colleges and universities offering online
courses and programs in the study compensated their faculty for developing online
courses while 33% did not. Twenty-nine percent of colleges and universities offering
online courses and programs in the study compensated their faculty for teaching online
courses while 71% did not. This means that many faculty at CIC colleges were expected
to teach both online and face-to-face for no additional pay, but instead were mandated to
do so by their yearly teaching contract. When reporting on the student challenges and

12

barriers to online teaching and learning that were encountered by CIC colleges and
universities, the survey findings as stated in Table 1.2.

The survey also investigated variations in course length as described in Table 1.3,
surveyors found that the most frequent lengths of online courses were eight to nine week
courses (offered by 37% of institutions), 13-15 week courses (offered by 29% of
institutions), eight week or fewer classes (offered by 21% of institutions), 10-12 week
courses (offered by five percent of institutions) and 16 week courses (offered by four
percent of institutions), while four percent of the institutions surveyed did not respond.
Additional findings suggested that 33% of students preferred six through eight week
courses and the same percentage preferred 9-12 week courses, while 19% preferred
online courses offered for 13 weeks or more and 14% of students preferred courses of
five weeks or less.

Clinefelter & Magda’s (2013) found that according to the chief academic officers
surveyed in the study, the ten greatest challenges that faculty faced in serving students
were as follows: training and recruiting online faculty, the demands from online students
for off-hours services, verifying student identity, measuring course outcomes, retaining
students, maintaining a learning management system and related technology, providing
access to campus services e.g. library services, identifying students with special needs
and detecting plagiarism. According to the survey, half of extensive universities and
colleges had the greatest problems with student retention and providing off-hours
services; while a quarter of the intermediate and limited colleges and universities were
challenged by the need for services at off-hours. The biggest challenge for all colleges
and universities offering online courses was recruiting and training faculty to create
content for online courses and teach online courses.
Of major importance, was the finding that blended and hybrid courses at CIC
institutions had been “able to increase student access, enrollment, and revenue,” since
students seemed to be “expressing more interest” in these courses than in the fully online
courses. Meanwhile these courses were not “having an impact on faculty” but instead the
creation of these courses had led to “increased faculty enrollment and retention, enhanced
alumni outreach and increased strategic partnerships with other organizations” (p. 15).
Ninety percent of extensive institutions had hybrid/blended learning courses, where faceto-face pedagogies had been upgraded to include online components. Sixty-five percent
of the CIC colleges with online courses and programs reported that their revenues had
increased when online components had been added to their face-to-face courses.
Presenting information from the survey with chief academic officers about

hybrid/blended courses, Table 1.4 lists ranked percentages of outcomes in order of their
importance at CIC colleges and universities because of the creation of hybrid/blended
courses.

Based on the analysis of their results, Clinefelter & Magda (2013), offered several
recommendations offered to the CIC colleges offering online courses and programs,
specifically they should:


Use accounting and budgeting practices to better track their online course
revenues



Expand their online course offerings, use their marketing money to
develop niche programs and offer improved training programs and
incentives to online faculty and staff teaching in these programs



Revise their college policies and procedures to be more accommodating to
faculty and staff teaching online



Accept legitimate credits, invest in the creation of online course outcomes



Invest in the creation of online course outcomes; and



“Synthesize” their “online and on the ground processes” so that they
provided “a consistent student experience” (p. 6).

For Online College Students: Comprehensive Data on Demands and Preferences
Report, Learninghouse (2015) conducted a survey that solicited input from 1,500 students
over 18 years of age nationwide, taking online courses or programs. Respondents were
from 49 states. Forty-three point nine percent of respondents were from institutions
accredited by the Northcentral Accreditation Agency, 25.5% from the Southern
Association of Colleges and Universities, 17.3% from the Middle States, Commission on
Higher Education, seven percent from the Western Association of Colleges and
Universities, five percent from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges
and one percent from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. The
Learninghouse (2015) findings suggested that approximately half of the Council for
Independent Colleges (CIC) member institutions surveyed offered at least one fully
online program, and 90% offered at least one online or hybrid class to their students in
2014. In contrast, more than 80% of AASCU members offering at least one fully online
20

program and nearly half offered five or more fully online programs in 2014. Forty-eight
percent of AASCU colleges offered five or more online programs, 34% offered one to
four online programs and 18% offered no online programs in 2014. In comparison CIC
colleges offered only 15% of colleges offered five or more fully online programs, 37%
offered one to four online programs and 48% offered no online programs at all in 2014.
The Learninghouse (2015) study findings indicated that online degrees have
continued “to gain acceptance amongst prospective students and higher education
leadership” with more colleges and universities initiating and offering “online programs
in greater numbers of subject areas and across multiple degree levels” (Para.1). Based on
2014 marketing information gathered, the top five areas of undergraduate and graduate
student study were business, nursing, computer science, engineering and information
technology. Marketing information suggested that for students enrolling in colleges and
universities in online programs, timing was critical. The report stated that “online
learning has become mainstream” and estimated that approximately 3.4 million college
students were engaged in fully online programs in 2014 – representing almost 17 percent
of all college students” (Para. 1). The top reason students enroll in online courses is
because affordable tuition is a critical decision-making factor for them, with
approximately 45% choosing the most inexpensive institution to attend and 55% chose a
more expensive option. Approximately 65% of all students enrolled in online education
lived within 50 miles of their online institution. The study found that “a significant
number of online students expressed interest in learning online but having on-campus
opportunities, such as internships” available to them as well. It was suggested that in the

21

future “this new model would “be a good way to expand the online student population”
(Para. 3) that resided within 50 miles of their institution’s ground campus.
Enrollment in online courses, for the schools surveyed that offered online
programs 64% offered undergraduate online programs, while 63% offered online
graduate programs. The vast majority of respondents said the greatest barrier to online
program success that they have yet to overcome was the student discipline required to
complete online courses. Approximately one-third of Council of Independent Colleges
(CIC) institutions charged less for online courses than residential courses that represents a
significant influencer. Two-thirds of CIC institutions offered additional faculty
compensation for the development of online courses, but less than one-third did this for
teaching online classes. Here Learninghouse’s (2015) findings mirror those of Clinefelder
& Magda (2013).
Grade Change: Tracking Online Education in the United States (Allen &
Seaman, 2014) gathered information from chief academic officers at 4,726 academic
institutions, and 60% of the sample universe and data were then merged with surveys
conducted in 2002-2012. Allen & Seaman (2014) reported that there were four types of
educational course delivery systems that were offered at higher education institutions in
the United States as described in Table 1.5.

According to Table 1.5 above, the first delivery mode was traditional education,
where students continued to attend a face-to-face class with no components of online
education. The second was a web-facilitated course, where the students attended a faceto-face class, but students also made use of the college learning management system for
up to 29% of the content by reading assignments and completing homework or tests
(Allen & Seaman, 2014). The third mode of delivery was the hybrid or blended course
where the students participated in both face-to-face and online classes; with 30-79% of
the class content consisting of student discussion-board participation, and participating in
taking tests, or downloading readings from a learning management system such as
Blackboard (Allen & Seaman, 2014). The fourth mode of delivery was online education,
wherein 80-100% of the content in the class was offered to students online in a course or
learning management system, such as Blackboard. In this case students participated in a
completely online course offering.
According to Allen & Seaman (2014), the number of students taking at least one
online course in college between 2002 and 2012 increased from 1,602,970 or 10% to
7,126,549 or 34% (Table 1.6). Allen & Seaman (2014) reported that their sample
included 1,731 public institutions that offered online courses and 20 did not. Of the
institutions that offered online courses, 1,430 non-profit private academic institutions
offered online courses to their students and 315 did not. The report found that more than
double the number of colleges offered online associate’s degrees, compared to the
number offering online bachelor’s degree programs.

In 2011, the annual growth rate of total enrollment in online courses slowed to 0.1%, with the annual growth rate of online enrollment at nine percent, lower than the
lowest enrollment for online courses in Fall of 2006. Despite this low enrollment in
courses during the Fall of 2011, the total enrollment for online courses overall had
increased by three percent since Fall of 2010. Online course enrollment numbers at
colleges and universities rallied in Fall 2012 to an annual growth rate of one percent, by
one percent with the annual enrollment growth rate still sluggish at six percent.

Table 1.8 shows in comparison only 81.9% of private colleges offered their
students online courses while 18.1% of private colleges still did not offer their students
online courses. When considering Carnegie classifications, more community colleges
with associate’s degrees (89.2%) were offering online courses to their students when
compared with four-year universities and colleges offering bachelor’s degrees, only
74.1% of those surveyed provided online courses for their students to take.
Allen & Seaman (2014) also reported that chief academic officers completing the
survey between 2003 and 2012 considered the learning outcomes in online courses to be
inferior to those created for face-to-face courses. While their opinions had improved
slightly in 2006, they continued to indicate a concern in 2013.

27

Sorensen (2014) conducted a study relating class size to instructor performance.
Sorensen (2014) suggested that if an online class was too large, online instructors might
not have the time to provide quality instruction to all the students. It took time to mark
student work and discussion boards, so instructors had less one-on-one time in the online
class and thus provided less quality education for a portion of the students in the class.
Sorensen (2014) suggested that an optimum online class size of 11-19 students would
allow the online instructor to establish much more effective relationships with their
students. That would also allow instructors to “challenge student thinking, encourage
students to elaborate on their thoughts, help students to make connections between course
content and the real world and share their own experiences” (Sorensen, 2014, p. 573)
with other students in the online class. Allen & Seaman (2014) reported that chief
academic officers also had concerns that students taking courses online were often not
academically ready or not mature enough to take an online course; and would need much
more support from teachers than if they were to take the same course face-to-face.
When chief academic officers were asked if students in online courses would need
more discipline to be successful in an online course, Table 1.9 compares the responses in
2005 and 2013.

Sixty-six percent of chief academic officers surveyed in 2013, compared with
57% surveyed in 2005, said that students would need more discipline in order to be
successful when taking a specialized online course at their institutions. More than half of
the participants agreed that students taking courses toward their bachelor’s degree would
need to be more disciplined if they wanted to succeed when taking online courses as
compared with taking face-to-face courses. When asked about discipline needed for the
successful completion of online courses in comparison to face-to-face courses, 70% of
participants in 2005 and slightly more participants, 70.7% in 2013 were convinced that
students needed more discipline to complete online courses than they did with face-toface classes, if they wanted to be successful.
Burkhardt, Kinnie & Cournoyer (2008) conducted a study to determine if online
or face-to-face students would do better in sections of an information literacy for-credit
course. Their survey found that students who self-selected an online course performed
better than students forced to take an online course. This was often because they were
more confident and often self-selected the online course because they were technology
savvy.
According Allen & Seaman (2014) as reported in Table 1.10, the chief academic
officers participating in the survey were very concerned about student retention.

In 2013, compared with 2004 and 2009, a significantly higher percentage of chief
academic officers were extremely concerned about the problem of retaining the students
enrolled in their online courses, when compared with students enrolled in face-to-face
courses.
Relationships at the college or university that added meaning to students’ learning
and encouraged them to persist in their academic life were least likely to develop when
students took courses online or at a distance (Bell, 2008). Often, the nature of the online
course affected students leading them to feel isolated, those students who failed to engage
with peers, faculty and others were “at the highest risk of dropping out” (Bell, p.1).
Clearly, online information literacy courses need to be rigorously developed using
good instructional methods in order to retain online students. Retention is particularly
important to Higher Learning Commission (HLC) accreditation (Higher Learning
Commission, 2016).

Relating Metaliteracy to Information Literacy

Mackey and Jacobsen (2011) and introduced in the Broadening of Information
Literacy is a major element of the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016). In the metaliteracy
model, information is viewed as a non-static object that is not just retrieved but it is “a
dynamic entity that is produced and shared collaboratively with…innovative Web 2.0
technologies” taking many formats that are produced and refined through multimodal
online modalities (Mackey & Jacobsen, 2011). Information literacy models and more
specifically, the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) developed prior to the social media
revolution of the 21st century did not address the fluidity of information transfer in the
online environment and must therefore be expanded and improved allowing for this
inclusion.
According to Mackey & Jacobson’s metaliteracy model (State University of New
York, 2015), information seekers utilize their cognitive skills in order to use, share,
incorporate and then produce the information they have gathered in various ways. To do
this they used different media such as social media, mobile devices, open education
resources online and were enabled to become learners, authors or creators of information,
thereby, sharing the learning process with others through these assorted media. All the
media that the information seeker, author and producer used were collaborative, needing
responses and interaction from their peers. For example, the scholarly environment
information could be shared by author-creators developing open textbooks online or
using these open textbooks for their classes so that their students can continue the
31

learning process. The licenses available for the scholar to download the textbook were
also collaborative because they provided the scholar with free access to a book, and in
some cases there was even the option for scholars to provide the author with feedback
about the learning process when using their online textbook in a class. The metaliteracy
model created by Mackey and Jacobson (2011), expanded information literacy theory to
incorporate the emerging technologies within it, which were explored through open
education learning and collaboration. Metaliteracy went beyond traditional information
literacy to embrace emerging technologies such as digital, media and visual literacy.
Learners were empowered to collaborate with others in the social interactive environment
and find, use, share and produce information and also creatively and innovatively use
information, as shown in Figure 1.2.

32

Within this information literacy model, the learner had many roles over time in
the social interactive environment as an individual or as a team member, using and
gathering information through interaction with others at a local or global level and acting
within any of the information user roles (learner, creator, teacher, producer, author,
collaborator, translator, researcher or participant) as shown in Figure 1.3.

33

Figure 1.3
The Metaliterate Learner Model

Note: Adapted from State University of New York, Empire State College, (2015). Metaliteracy
MOOC.Adapted from the work of Mackey & Jacobson.

“Metaliteracy included a central metacognitive component that promoted
reflective learning and ‘thinking about thinking’ related to individual’s learning
goals and objectives. This metacognitive dimension provided users with valuable
insights about their own literacy development and prepared them to gain a critical
thinking perspective in dynamic new media and open learning environments”
(State University of New York, 2015).
Livingston (1997) stated that metacognition allowed the learner to be a successful higher
order thinker which involved “active control over the cognitive processes engaged in
learning” and “activities such as planning how to approach a given learning task,
monitoring comprehension, and evaluating progress toward the completion of a task are

34

metacognitive in nature” (Para.1). Livingston (1997) explained that theory of
metacognition originated from the work of Flavell (1979, 1987) and was described as
consisting of metacognitive knowledge (general knowledge, tasks) and metacognitive
regulation (understanding, planning and monitoring tasks) and experiences. Cognition
was defined as the ability for the individual to develop self-regulation and thinking skills
and processes that allowed for the enhancement of learning; with both metacognition and
cognition being linked to intelligence (Livingston, 1997). Higher order thinking skills
that were included in the metacognitive and cognitive domains and that were developed
by learners were skills such as information comprehension, application, analysis,
evaluation, synthesis and creation.
There were two more domains of learning that were included in the metaliteracy
model (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011) when describing metacognitive learners. These were
the affective and behavioral learning domains. The affective domain theory related back
to the affective learning theories of Krathwohl, Bloom & Masia (1973). The behavioral
domain related to the psychomotor domain learning theories of Harrow (1972). The
affective domain involved the learner’s feelings and emotions, as described in Kuhlthau’s
(1991) information search process (ISP) theory where the learner’s emotions were
described at every stage of the information search process. In considering Krathwohl,
Bloom & Masia’s (1972) theories, learners received information and experience
awareness and stimulation in its receipt. They then could or could not respond to the
information received and how the information was valued depended on the learner’s
attitudes and their value and belief system. The information was then internalized; but
how the information was organized was based on the individual learner’s practices,

35

values and beliefs. The behavioral or kinesthetic domain was responsible for the learner’s
physical functions, reflexive actions and their interpretative movements. When using
Harrow’s Taxonomy (1972) six psychomotor controls were important in aiding the
learner in the learning process. The behavioral domain controlled the learner’s
fundamental movements e.g. walking, running, standing; reflex movements e.g. eye
movements; brain function, muscular contractions; perceptual abilities e.g. visual,
auditory, tactile abilities; non-discursive communication e.g. facial posture, facial
expression and physical abilities e.g. agility, strength; skilled movements e.g. sports,
dance.
Mackey & Jacobson’s (2011) metaliteracy theory expanded information literacy
both in definition and practice because the Association of College and Research Libraries
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) fell short of
addressing the information seeker’s needs within the new online environments. Instead,
to better understand information searching in the online environment, Mackey &
Jacobson (2011) pointed out that the Association of College and Research Libraries
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) must embrace
models such as the Seven Pillars Model for Information Literacy. This model, shown in
Figure 1.4 was created by The Society of College, National and University Libraries
(SCONUL) in the United Kingdom in 1999, and was revised in 2011, in order to align
with newer information literacy models for application in new information environments.
The SCONUL Seven Pillars Model for Information Literacy (Society of College,
National and University Libraries, 2011) included skills such as “the ability to construct
strategies for locating information and “the ability to build upon existing information,

36

contributing to the creation of knowledge” (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011, p.63). It was
emphasized that searchers could only reach the levels of synthesis and information
creation, as experts which were not included in the Association of College and Research
Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000).
Since 1999, the SCONUL model (Society of College, National and University Libraries,
2011), shown in Figure 1.4 have been improved to expand on the Seven Pillars and
include “examples that acknowledge the changing information environment e.g. RSS
feeds” were “listed as a way to update information searches while emphasizing the
importance of understanding the source of information and the need to evaluate it
carefully” (p.64).

In reframing information literacy, Mackey & Jacobson (2011) stated that
information literacy frameworks were developed to focus on the cutting-edge of
emerging technologies so that they did not lag behind the innovations of Web 2.0 and
social media. As a result several information literacy frameworks were developed that
explained and described the different literacy types in the digital age, that shared similar
skills and connections to information literacy, with some literacy types not having been
included in the information literacy definition as defined by the Association of College
and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education (2000). The literacy types adherent to the digital age listed by Mackey &
Jacobson (2011) include: media literacy, visual literacy, digital literacy, cyberliteracy,
and information fluency. These types were not all inclusive of the literacies described in
the library and education literature. Table 1.11 below includes the literacy types
described by Mackey & Jacobson (2011) that were directly related to information
literacy.

American Association of College and Universities Rubrics
Assessment is essential to the information literacy course. The American
Association of College and Universities (AAC&U) Value (Valid Assessment of Learning
in Undergraduate Education) project is an ongoing campus-based assessment initiative,
released in Fall 2009 and sponsored by AAC&U as part of its Liberal Education and
America’s Promise (LEAP) initiative. The VALUE rubrics are scoring guides that were
created to provide teaching faculty with tools to assess authentic student work, produced
across a diverse array of learning progressions and institutions in the United States.
Teams then identified key criteria that were “broadly shared regarding critical dimensions
of achievement for each student proficiency” (AAC& U, 2016). Frequently Asked
Questions, Para 2). The VALUE Rubrics were used by faculty to determine how well
their students had met graduation level achievements in learning outcomes essential to
the college programs in which they studied. The rubrics, consisting of sixteen essential
learning outcomes, were created by faculty teams from institutions of different sizes from
across the United States. “As of December 2015, the rubrics have been accessed by more
than 42,000 individuals from more than 4,200 unique institutions, including more than
2,800 colleges and universities. The VALUE rubrics have also been approved for use in
meeting national standards for accountability established by the Voluntary System of
Accountability (VSA)” (AAC&U: Value, 2016, Para.3). The sixteen value rubrics were
organized into three categories of overlapping skills as shown below in the diagram in
Fig. 1.2. The first category is Intellectual and Practical Skills that consists of the
following rubrics: Inquiry and Analysis, Critical Thinking, Creative Thinking, Written
Communication, Oral Communication, Quantitative Literacy, Information Literacy,
Reading, Teamwork, and Problem Solving. The second category is Personal and Social
41

Responsibility that includes Civic Knowledge and Engagement – Local and Global,
Intercultural Knowledge and Competence, Ethical Reasoning and Action, Global
Learning, and Foundations and Skills for Lifelong Learning. Finally the Integrative
Learning category stands alone. Each of the VALUE Rubrics is preceded by a definition
of the competency is provided, including framing language in which to view the
competencies, and a glossary. The rubric values are assigned in terms of benchmarking,
and milestone and capstone values in association with the major competencies that have
been identified.
The three VALUE Rubrics categories in Fig. 1.5 were considered to be most
important to faculty in information literacy programs. The information literacy, creative
and critical thinking rubrics were calibrated for use to access student performance on
information literacy course outcomes.

The Link Between Information Literacy and Academic Writing Skills

Bowles-Terry, Davis & Holliday (2008) suggested that librarians and writing
instructors have much in common because “information literacy theory has a reciprocal
influence on composition pedagogy” (p.225) as a result of the paradigm shift in writing
instruction which has opened up “possibilities for teaching a more situated, processoriented and inquiry-driven rhetoric” (p. 225). In this study, Utah State University
librarians and writing instructors were actively involved in “a process of writing

43

information literacy” (p. 226). Librarians aligned the goals of freshmen and sophomore
composition classes with their information literacy course. In 2005, five Utah State
University writing instructors were invited to serve as Information Literacy Fellows
during the summer and work with librarians to develop new lesson plans, to create new
instructional approaches that would better align and integrate information literacy into
freshmen and sophomore writing classes. Problem-based learning was used in order to
provide students in the freshman and sophomore English classes with skills to solve
authentic research problems. As a result, four common goals were developed for Utah
State University’s freshman and sophomore English classes, first asking students to
define their information literacy needs and then helping them to “focus, shape and
organize their ideas and writing” in the class. Students explored their topics with a variety
of sources and were taught to understand different information types, how to evaluate
information, develop their critical thinking skills and recognize their own research and
writing problems “in order to get assistance and further develop their writing and
information literacy skills” (Bowles-Terry, Davis & Holliday, 2008, p. 227).
In freshman English students were organized in groups and they participated in a
Save Our Schools project that focused on identifying and solving problems relating to the
United States education system. Librarian interaction with students was divided into three
sessions. In the first session librarians visited the class for 20 minutes presenting a
relevant education myths and new resource information. In the second session the
instructor and the librarian worked together so that students could participate in a
brainstorming session. In the third session, the class worked as a group in the computer
lab and they focused on what they already knew about the problem and then worked

44

through worksheets and instructions on how to use the library resources to find articles
and also find additional source tools for the project. In the sophomore class, a question
was chosen and students approached it from different angles and also explored different
discourse communities and how information to answer their question could be gathered.
Student final papers were evaluated by the teachers and the librarians and students were
asked to reflect on what they had learned.
Bowles-Terry, Davis & Holliday (2008) found that librarians needed to provide
students with more coaching and non-traditional scaffolding opportunities that allowed
them to interact with the librarians in order to obtain help with finding research resources.
Students needed to be encouraged to work with their peers, share information with them
and spend more of their time on reflection and peer discussion. The latter allowed
students to better organize evaluate and synthesize information before they started the
process of writing. Bowles-Terry, Davis & Holliday (2008) stated in integrating
information literacy into the English program at the Utah State University, the librarians
and writing teachers “had a constitutive influence” on their “intertwined practice” and in
exploring writing and information literacy theory and practice, it was discovered that
“that writing information literacy was certainly possible given the parallels between
information literacy and composition theory.” Bowles-Terry, Davis & Holliday (2008)
suggested further that the problem that remained, despite these parallels was getting
students to ask meaningful questions and apply, synthesize and use the information they
had gathered effectively, rather than to just focus solely on completing their assignment
and not thinking any further about it.

45

Cook (2014) conducted a longitudinal study (1999-2007) at the University of
West Georgia to determine how the library contributed to student academic writing skills
and student retention. It also studied the extent to which there was a connection between
students graduating from college in less than four years and their completion of a 15week, two-hour for-credit information literacy course as undergraduates.
The purpose was to assess the impact of earlier institutional decisions. In 1998,
the University System of Georgia’s Board of Regents directed every college in the
system to adopt a fifteen-week, standard core curriculum. The University of West
Georgia adopted this core curriculum and declared its college “priorities to be
communication, critical thinking and twenty-first century technology” (p.173). As a
result, the Ingram Library expanded a former one-credit hour, nine-week academic
research course into a two-credit hour, fifteen-week course, LIBR 1101. The LIBR 1101
course was offered to freshmen as part of the core curriculum at the university and was
one of several options that students could take to fulfill their core requirements. By 2001
the course was offered completely online. In 2007, the library brought the course
objectives in-line with the American College and Research Libraries Information
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000).
The study participants were restricted to 15,012 full-time freshmen that had
attended the university between 1999 to the summer of 2007. Two cohorts were created
including a cohort of students that had taken the library course sometime during their
college career and a cohort of students that did not take the library course at all. The
library used statistical testing to ascertain whether there was a relationship existing
between library instruction and student success rates. The grade point average (GPA)

46

and graduation rates of students in each cohort in the study were taken from the
university database. Cook (2014) found that students who had graduated from college in
four years were positively associated with those students who had taken the library
course for seven out of the nine years of the study. In 2005-2007, students who took the
course did graduate at higher rates than those who had not taken the course. Although
four-year graduation rates did not show that taking the library course had an effect on
their GPA’s, it was found that students who had taken the course and who graduated after
five or six years at the university, still had higher GPA’s overall than those students in the
cohort who had not taken the library course. Cook (2014) found that 56% of students who
took the LIBR 1101 course graduated before the summer of 2011, while only 30% of the
students in the cohort who had not taken the course actually graduated at all.
The results of this study suggested that students taking the information literacy
class had higher retention rates than the students who did not take the class. It can also be
posited that students who take an information literacy for-credit course had more
confidence, knowledge, and motivation to continue learning due to enhanced academic
skills acquired in the information literacy course.
Booth, Lowe, Tagge & Stone (2015) conducted a mixed-methods rubric
assessment study. Claremont Colleges were a consortium of seven private colleges with
an enrollment of 7,000 undergraduate students across five liberal arts colleges and two
graduate universities. Librarians at the common college library provided students at each
college with library instruction for twenty years; but each college’s professors had more
than 100 separate and unique arrangements with the library in terms of how library
instruction was offered to their students.

47

The study was conducted in Pitzer College’s First Year Seminar program to
determine the student learning effects of differentiated levels of information literacy
course engagements and instruction effectiveness and if instructor performance was
correlated with student learning self-perception and performance. The study evaluated
student work using surveys and rubrics indicating increased librarian intervention in their
writing projects. Statistics was used to determine whether or not there was a positive
impact on student performance that was research writing based. The methodology of the
study included “a rubric-based analysis of student research papers” and “a comparative
evaluation” (Booth, Lowe, Tagge & Stone, 2015, p. 627) of librarian teaching
effectiveness. Ninety-nine student written paper samples were evaluated using two scales,
(1) a “librarian instruction engagement level” scale that had four levels and ranged from
no librarian collaboration with students to high collaboration and (2) a “syllabus
assignment design collaboration level” (p. 627) scale that consisted of levels ranging
from the librarian receiving the class syllabus from the instructor to having integrated
information literacy into the course being taught at the college. These levels were further
critiqued by librarians working at Pitzer College with students in the First Year Seminar
program. The rubric had four writing levels that ranged from initial to emerging,
developed and highly developed. During the rubric analysis of the student papers that
focused on the thesis statement, 50% of the papers scored at the developed level, 43%
scored at the emerging level and only seven percent scored at the highly developed level.
During the rubric analysis of the evaluation of sources and also the analysis of
communication, four percent of the papers were scored at the initial level, 38% at the
emerging level, 52% of the papers were scored at the developed level and six percent at

48

the highly developed level. During the rubric analysis of how students used attribution
and citation formats, students scored the lowest with 12% at the initial level, 48% at the
emerging level, 36% at the developed level and only four percent at the highly developed
level.
The study findings suggested that there was no correlation between student and
faculty evaluations and the perceived and actual gains in student performance that had
improved as a result of increased information literacy intervention at Pitzer College.
However, further findings suggested that there were high levels of student and faculty
interaction with the instruction librarians and that student performance had improved
dramatically in the first year seminar class because of the quality of librarian classroom
support and interaction, which “correlated to the quality of student learning” (p. 636).
Booth, Lowe, Tagge & Stone (2015) also found that even though the one-shot model
which provided minimal faculty engagement encouraged “information literacy concept
retention at Pitzer College…a course integrated model with multiple diverse pedagogical
interventions at the syllabus and classroom level consistently achieved greater” student
“performance gains” (p. 636).

Online Information Literacy Course Growth in Colleges and Universities

Primary Research Group Inc. (2008) conducted a survey of 112 colleges and
universities in the United States (90% of responding institutions) and Canada (10% of
responding institutions) that benchmarked information literacy efforts between 2006 and
2007. Despite an expressed concern for student gains in information literacy, relevant
course development grew very slowly. Between 2006-2007, according to the Primary
49

Research Group Inc. (2008) survey--as illustrated in Tables 1.12 through Table 1.14.
Seventy-six percent of United States colleges and universities taught information literacy
classes in computer instruction labs or learning centers, specifically designed for
information literacy instruction.
At the time that the survey was conducted, 26% percent of United States colleges
and universities in the sample were already offering online and distance learning
information literacy courses, with the public colleges offering eight percent more
information literacy online course offerings to students than the private colleges. These
online courses were taught by librarians with faculty status in 30% of the cases, while
13% of librarians in the sample did not have faculty status and 57% were taught by
librarians with no faculty status at all (Primary Research Group Inc., 2008). Faculty status
was important in regard to information literacy because these faculty librarians would be
well-positioned to serve on curriculum committees to vet curriculum in their general
education programs alongside fellow faculty, to help to integrate their information
literacy courses into the majors at their colleges and universities.

information literacy classes 30% of the time at their institutions, while these courses were
taught only 13.2% of these courses were taught by non-faculty and staff at the institutions

In 2006-2007 it was common for information literacy to be taught using
interactive online information literacy tutorials, with a mean of three tutorials being made
available to students in each of the responding United States colleges and universities.
Librarians created video information literacy tutorials using Flash, Camtasia, and Viewlet
and Captivate software. They also taught students how to use software packages such as
the Microsoft Suite and Adobe and also how to use “html” to build websites in their
Information Literacy classes. However, these tutorials were generally not for-credit
information literacy classes. This meant that students in information literacy class were
being taught basic library search skills along with some computer literacy skills, but the
classes offered by librarians in 2006-7 were not offered as for- credit courses and were

52

thus not fully integrated into student’ academic experiences as high-stakes graded courses
(Primary Research Group Inc. 2008).
The survey also explored libraries’ social media presence (through pages or blogs
on Facebook or other platforms, as well as and its importance to information literacy
tutorials linked to those platforms) and the importance of this presence to information
literacy. In 2006-2007, only 25% of the colleges and universities surveyed had a presence
on Facebook. Eleven percent of colleges and universities surveyed had a presence on
Myspace, seven percent on Second Life, nine percent on listservs, and 53% on course
management systems such as Blackboard, while 20% did not respond regarding the use
of social media at their colleges. Meanwhile, the study also reported that 25% of colleges
and universities did have blogs where they included library links and tutorials for their
students to access. It was not known what the other 75% of colleges and universities were
using to provide student access to library materials. Results of the survey indicated that
the library Facebook presence was growing; but libraries appeared to create an
equivalently strong presence in their university’s course management system, since this
was where they were starting to build their future information literacy courses and it
made sense for students to access additional library resources there (Primary Research
Group Inc., 2008).
According to the Primary Research Group Inc. (2008) survey findings, only 27%
of participating United States colleges and universities said that librarians had surveyed
their college faculty to assess faculty satisfaction with library support at their schools
during the year. None had surveyed faculty about their perceptions of information
literacy. Instead, the faculty were surveyed about the library’s direct services to them e.g.

53

interlibrary loan, reference services, one-shot bibliographic instruction sessions and how
these were being utilized at these universities rather than about their reaction to
information literacy. Based on the survey in 2006-2007 academic librarians was not yet
viewing information literacy to be as important as all the other services that the library
was providing to faculty.

2014 Information Literacy Surveys
Primary Research Group Inc. (2014) designed surveys that were conducted with
51 community colleges, 30 public and 21 private institutions in the United States and
Canada. Fifteen were four-year institutions, 19 were community colleges, 12 were
graduate colleges and five were research universities in the United States that
benchmarked information literacy efforts during 2012-13. Sixteen institutions had student
populations of less than 2,500 students while all the other institutions had student
populations of 2,500 and more.
According to the Primary Research Group (2014) survey, 13.64% of the
information literacy instructors surveyed said that they required that the library create
variable one to three credit hour courses at their institutions. This is an extremely small
number of institutions considering the push by professional organizations such as
Association of College and Research Libraries and AAC&U to encourage librarians to
develop for credit courses and programs. Association of College and Research Libraries
and AAC&U invited them yearly, to participate in information literacy professional
development programs such as the Immersion Program (Association of College and
Research Libraries Immersion Program, 2016). The latter was created to prepare

54

librarians to teach information literacy to their students by developing relevant
information literacy courses or integrations.
According to the Primary Research Group (2014) survey 63.6% of the institutions
stated that some kind of information literacy training was a graduation requirement. Fifty
percent of those instructors surveyed said that their institutions had information literacy
training requirements in place for their students, but that it was not formalized and thus
did not require their librarians to create for credit information literacy courses of any
kind. Fifty-seven percent of institutions stated that formalization was possible in the next
three years, while 25% stated that information literacy formalization was highly unlikely
at their institutions. Sixty-six percent of four-year colleges surveyed offered one or more
computer labs to participating libraries for the purpose of information literacy instruction
compared with 63% of community colleges in the sample who did the same. Institutional
recognition that information literacy was important enough to be a course requirement
most often occurred in the general education programs of these colleges. Even if an entire
course was not required, students had to receive one-shot presentations from librarians
during their four-year stay at the university. Many would be exposed to flipped classroom
experiences where they were required to complete online tutorials, or view online videos
on information literacy topics that prepared them for their library visits and interactions
with the library tools.
According to the Primary Research Group Survey (2014), 90% of the institutions
that had larger enrollments had their librarians serving on curriculum committees. This
was very important because information literacy librarians with some power to vet
curriculum would be in a better position to help institutions’ libraries to set the

55

information literacy collaborations in motion, particularly for working with faculty to
develop the information literacy program for freshmen and also for the integration of
information literacy into the majors and embedding librarians into courses where they
would be interacting with students in the disciplines.
Participants were asked to respond to questions regarding how English
Departments at their institutions handled information literacy. Almost fifty-one percent of
the participants had responses split between “they seem to try, but they could do better”
and “they do well enough,” with 19.6 stating that “it is a high priority.” Thirteen point
seven percent said that in their situation “it is an excellent collaboration and we jointly
accomplish our information literacy goals” while 11.8% said “they are somewhat of a
laggard.” According to the Primary Research Group (2014) just a little more than half of
the information literacy instructors participating in the survey, 52.4%, stated that they
used student evaluation in the information literacy classes to assess their student
information literacy skills, while 47.6% of instructors participating in the survey did not
assess their student’s information literacy skills. Participant responses were very
important because it was very common for information literacy librarians to collaborate
with composition instructors, more specifically in the library in large colleges e.g. fouryear colleges and universities, where librarians wanted to be able to participate in and
provide students with information literacy in high enrollment, high impact classes where
they made contact with the most students enrolled at the university. They were able to
teach the largest number of incoming freshmen and transfer students research skills that
would prepare them to be successful when writing research papers in college.

56

According to the Primary Research Group (2014) only 29.4% of all institutions in
the study offered online or distance learning information literacy courses. According to
the study only six percent of four-year colleges and 42.1% of community colleges offered
online or distance information literacy courses to their students. The study found that as
the tuition at a college decreased, the likelihood that distance and online courses that cost
more in terms of college tuition would be offered also decreased at that institution (p.54).
Compared with online and distance courses, the Primary Research Group (2014) study
found that more libraries were using online components in their course offerings to
students. These statistics are not surprising considering the very largest research intensive
institutions appeared to only be at the cusp of developing online and distance programs
and had very few information literacy course offerings to provide to their students at a
distance or online. The largest institutions were instead focusing on the creation of online
tutorials and online interactive tutorials to teach library information tool literacy to their
students on-site, at a distance and online.
According to the Primary Research Group (2014) survey, 50% of the participants
stated that their libraries offered interactive tutorials to their students. Private participant
institutions offered a mean of seven and a median of four point five interactive tutorials
to their students while participants from public institutions offered their students a mean
of four point eight and a median of two point five interactive tutorials teaching
information literacy to their students. “Four-year colleges offered nearly twice as many,
with “a mean of eight point eight as the next closest type of college” (p.57). Almost fiftynine percent of all survey participants stated that they offered video tutorials on
information literacy topics to their students. When compared with community colleges,

57

where 47.3% of the participant libraries created information literacy video tutorials,
53.3% of the four-year colleges in the sample provided video tutorials to their students on
information literacy topics.

The Online Information Literacy Course

According to Kasowitz-Scheer & Pasqualoni (2002), researchers from Syracuse
University, “information literacy instruction required a shift in focus from teaching
specific information resources to a set of critical thinking skills involving the use of
information” (p.3), a change that was not reflected until fourteen years later, in the
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework (2016).
Information literacy instruction includes “a variety of instructional approaches”
(p. 3), such as course-related instruction, course-integrated instruction, online modules
and tutorials, and standalone courses. Information literacy was taught as face-to-face
instruction courses, blended instruction courses, online courses, and any delivery option
could be for-credit courses or non-credit courses.
Kasowitz-Scheer & Pasqualoni (2002) posited that colleges and universities
should choose the information literacy course approach that best suited their mission,
purpose, student needs, student outcomes, budget, staffing, facilities, and faculty time
constraints. Collaboration was necessary between the library, faculty, and student
services. This collaboration could often lead to the creation of student surveys to
determine their needs (Breivik, 1998). However, only two examples of this type of
collaboration could be found in Hrycaj (2006) & Elrod and Wallace & Sirigos’ (2012)

58

analyses regarding the development of information literacy curriculum and syllabi for
this purpose.

The Higher Learning Commission Accreditation

All accreditation processes include an institutional self-evaluation in which an
institution of higher education evaluates how well it has met its goals and objectives, as
well as the accreditation agency’s criteria. There are five regional higher education
accreditation agencies in the United States that were recognized by the Council for
Higher Education Accreditation: the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), Middle States
Commission on Higher Learning, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges
Commission on Institutes of Higher Education (NEASC-CIHE), the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACS) and WASC
Senior College and University Commission (WASC). The Higher Learning Commission
oversaw eighteen states, including Kansas.
The Higher Learning Commission offered three program options or pathways that
higher education institutions could follow toward accreditation. There was the AQUIP,
Open, or Standard Pathways, from which the institution could select a program.
Institutions undergoing accreditation responded to five criteria in their self-study as
described in Table 1.15 below.

59

Table 1.15
Higher Learning Commission Accreditation Criteria Descriptions
Accreditation Criterion

Description

Criterion One:
Mission

The institution’s mission is clear and
articulated publicly; it guides the
institution’s operations.

Criterion Two:
Integrity: Ethical and Responsible Conduct

The institution acts with integrity; its
conduct is ethical and responsible.

Criterion Three:
Teaching and Learning: Quality Resources
and Support

The institution provides high quality
education, wherever and however its
offerings are delivered.

Criterion Four:
Teaching and Learning: Evaluation and
Improvement

The institution demonstrates
responsibility for the quality of its
educational courses, learning
environments, and support services, and
it evaluates their effectiveness for student
learning through processes designed to
promote continuous improvement.

Criterion Five:
Resources, Planning and Institutional
Effectiveness

The institution’s resources, structures,
and processes are sufficient to fulfill its
mission, improve the quality of its
educational offerings, and respond to
future challenges and opportunities. The
institution plans for the future.

Higher Learning Commission and the Library: Criterion 3

The criterion of importance to the university library is Criterion 3, ‘Teaching and
Learning: Quality Services and Support.’ The Higher Learning Commission specified
that, to address Criterion 3, “the institution” must demonstrate that it “provides high
quality education, wherever and however its offerings are delivered” (Higher Learning
Commission, 2015).
According to the Higher Learning Commission, libraries had to employ sufficient
staff to maintain library resources, such as books, e-resources, online databases, and
interlibrary loan services. They also had to “train students in their use” (Saunders, 2007,
p.323). Librarians had an implied “responsibility for user education” though that was not
directly stated (Saunders, 2007, p. 323) by the Higher Learning Commission. The Higher
Learning Commission’s criteria did not specify the inclusion of information literacy in
the college library setting.
Since Criterion 3 focused merely on the provision of quality library resources to
library users, the university’s report to the Higher Learning Commission included the
library’s information in its responses to Criterion 3. It included all the information
literacy course changes made in Criterion 3, even though these were unnecessary. The
course changes provided much more than what was required for academic libraries under
Higher Learning Commission control. Criterion 4 ‘Teaching and Learning: Evaluation
and Improvement’ was only to be used for subject description, analysis, and assessment,
without the inclusion of information literacy.

61

Statement of the Problem

Four-year colleges have increasingly instituted information literacy courses in
order to bolster remedial student academic skills, including student library research skills
related to writing academic papers. The framework for student academic skill
enhancement is most often the information literacy course. Understanding what
constitutes an exemplary information literacy course is important to retention and
accreditation. Knowing what guides exemplary information literacy courses, and the
theoretical frameworks needed to ready information literate students for the 21st century
workforce, will help in understanding the complexities of designing exemplary
information literacy courses for colleges and universities.

Research Questions

The research questions relating to the development of information literacy courses
in exemplary colleges and universities in the United States are as follows:
1. How are selected four-year colleges implementing exemplary information literacy
courses?
2. How do exemplary four-year college library information literacy courses implement
the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy in Higher Education (2016)?

62

3. How do exemplary four-year colleges and universities implement digital literacy and
the six frames of the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)?

Purpose of the Study

The purpose of this qualitative study is to learn how selected four-year colleges
offer exemplary information literacy courses to support enhanced academic skills. It will
also provide information on how these institutions have applied the Association of
College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education (2000) and the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) to these exemplary courses.
Additionally, information gathered on how these exemplary courses have implemented
digital literacy elucidated how best to incorporate the Framework for Literacy in Higher
Education (2015) in these courses.

Significance of the Study

A void in the literature currently exists on exemplary college and university
information literacy courses, since researchers are more focused on implementing the
new Association of College and University Libraries Framework (2016). This
dissertation will explore how these exemplary information literacy courses are conducted
in selected four-year college and university academic libraries in the United States, and
how the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000), the new
63

Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016), and digital literacy
outcomes have been implemented in these courses.
The research findings will contribute to information literacy course research, to
the development of the knowledge base for college and university information literacy
course development and to a better understanding of how these courses aid in enhancing
student academic skills.
This study will expand the knowledge base in several ways. First, the results of
the study will be shared with the major stakeholders at the researcher’s institution so that
improvements can be implemented in the institution’s information literacy courses.
Second, the findings of this study will help information literacy instructors understand
and improve information literacy course development models and best practices in
identifying strengths and gaps in the course offered to improve student academic skills.
Third, the results have the potential to directly influence administrators, program
directors, faculty and other decision-makers in four-year colleges and universities to
develop information literacy courses for student academic skills enhancement purposes.

Delimitations of the Study

The delimitations of this study are related to the population from which these
qualitative responses will be collected, coded, and analyzed:
1. The study will be limited to understanding information literacy best practices
by analyzing the courses in eight exemplary information literacy programs at four-year
colleges and universities using a small, well-defined population that consisted of

64

librarians, faculty and administrators associated with these colleges and university
programs.
2. This study does not include students, since they do not take part curriculum
decisions in these universities and colleges in the study. This study will examine faculty,
administrators and library instructors who teach at eight United States colleges and
universities offering exemplary information literacy programs unique to their institutions.
For this reason, the research findings will have limited transferability to other institutions.

Chapter Summary

Topics discussed in this chapter included: the implementation of information
literacy in colleges and universities, how the teaching of information literacy has grown
over the past seven years based on two major statistical studies that have been done in the
field, the barriers to information literacy and the impetus for information literacy courses
in colleges and universities in the United States. Those discussions were followed by a
description of what an information literacy course was like, how an exemplary
information literacy program was defined and how the American College and Research
Libraries Instruction Section Best Practices Committee’s guidelines were developed to
vet exemplary programs so that other colleges and universities can learn from their
attempts at information literacy best practices and their librarians’ experiences. This
discussion was followed by describing online learning in a theoretical context. The
chapter concluded with a description of the online course and why the Higher Learning
Commission Criterion 3 was considered important to university libraries. This is followed
by the research questions, purpose, significance and delimitations of the study
65

Chapter 2 - Literature Review

Chapter Overview

This chapter is divided into four sections. The first section provides a theoretical
framework for the study, a description of the development of the concept of information
literacy and describes the history of information literacy. The remaining sections explain
the theories surrounding information literacy, information literacy and higher education,
and information literacy and the university library. First, information literacy is defined
and various reports that were written to spark information literacy implementation are
discussed. Following the reports, information literacy as a conceptual framework is
discussed along with the historical placement of information literacy and how changes in
information literacy instruction have fostered the creation of exemplary information
literacy programs in academia. In the section on information literacy and higher
education, the American College and Research Libraries Standards (2000), American
Association of School Librarians’ Standards (2007) and the process for a revised
American College and Research Libraries Standards are reviewed in detail. The
information literacy and higher education section explains how and why information
literacy was introduced into general education programs in colleges and universities and
discusses several issues that challenge librarians and educators in information literacy
instruction, such as lifelong learning, teaching formats, theoretical approaches and
information literacy assessment. In the information literacy and the university library
section, the library stakeholder is defined, as well as the role of library stakeholders in

66

information literacy course integration into the university curriculum. The digital literacy
section defines the concept of digital literacy and its relation to information literacy and is
followed by a description of research that was conducted in relation to digital literacy
courses that have been developed.

Conceptual Framework: Information Literacy

“Information Literacy” is a term that was first coined by Paul Zurkowski (1974)
when, as president Information Industry Association, he presented a report to the
National Commission on Libraries and Information Science stating that “Information
Literacy is not knowledge; it is concepts or ideas that enter the person’s field of
perception, are evaluated and assimilated reinforcing or changing the individual’s
concept of reality and/or the ability to act” (Zurkowski, 1974, p. 1). Zurkowski was
saying that information, when molded into knowledge, was a powerful tool that could be
purposefully used to change how people understand our world it was also capable of
changing people’s actions in the world. Zurkowski (1974) emphasized the importance of
teaching people to become literate through measuring the value of information. They
would then be able to mold information to their own needs (Zurkowski, 1974). Librarians
in the 1970’s were of the understanding that information literacy was essential to society
and that a new set of skills was required to utilize information more effectively. However,
they were not yet able to articulate the new skills that would be needed in information
literacy, despite understanding that new skill sets were required (Zurkowski, 1974;
Behrens, 1994).

67

As librarians began to define information literacy and explore the future role of
librarians and libraries in the new information society, Zurkowski’s concepts and ideas
also took momentum, driving the “information literacy movement” (Breivik & Ford,
1993, p. 98) that grew out of the need for educational reform and the technological
change movements of the 1980’s. As a result, library user education programs were
merged with or were replaced by new information literacy programs, because librarians
realized that the “new technologies of the decade” were “to be recognized as an important
feature” of information literacy (Behrens, 1994, p. 311). Library users needed to master
the new technologies, along with “new intellectual skills,” if they were to attain the
computer and functional literacy skills that allowed them to easily use and manipulate
information essential for completing their everyday tasks (Behrens, 1994, p. 312).

Development of the Concept of Information Literacy

In the late 19th century, due to major changes and developments in United States
colleges and universities, the college or university libraries that were established were
centralized and hierarchical, containing standardized collections purchased from the
Wilson Catalog and lists. Bibliographic instruction, which was defined by Shaw (2003)
as a model used to teach the research process to students using a one-shot approach, by
teaching them the basics about how to use the library and locate library resources, was
the forerunner of information literacy instruction. During the 19th century, bibliographic
instruction was first taught in academic libraries such as Oberlin College, Harvard
University, Bowdoin College, Georgetown University, the University of Rochester and
the University of Michigan as courses that combined the history of books and libraries,
68

basic library research strategies and the critical evaluation of materials. By the early 20th
century, these courses lacked quality and were in decline. Between the years 1920-1960,
one important scholarly activity and three scholarly papers on bibliographic instruction
were delivered to the academic community that had lasting effects on the discipline of
librarianship and the teaching of bibliographic instruction in academia. The first was the
establishment of the bibliographic instruction program by B. Lamar Johnson at Stephens
College between the years of 1931-1950 (Gilton, n.d.).
Following in its wake, in 1935, a series of articles was published specifically for
high school and college students by Louis Shore entitled, How to Use your Library.
Following the bibliographic instruction articles, Shore published the book Origins of the
American College Library, which suggested that college professors should be teacherlibrarians and that students would learn best about the research process, through
independent study at the library. In 1940, the publication of Teaching with Books by
Harvie Bascomb further influenced librarians in their bibliographic pursuits. From 19601962, Patricia Knapp at Wayne State University, implemented the Monteith Experiment,
which attempted to integrate bibliographic instruction into the curriculum, but it failed.
The failure of this experiment was due to student and faculty resistance to the program.
Despite this failure at Wayne State University, in the late 1960’s, Evan Farber at Earlham
College in Indiana was inspired to implement a bibliographic instruction program that
was managed by student, faculty and administration consensus, which proved to be
extremely successful (Gilton, n.d.).
The success of Johnson, Shore and Farber’s bibliographic instruction programs
initiated the bibliographic instruction movement of the 1970’s that offered library

69

orientations and instruction about basic reference tools. This movement also emphasized
point-of-use, individualized and course-related bibliographic instruction sessions to
college students. During the 1970’s the bibliographic instruction movement was a
grassroots movement led by young academics who were affected by library
transformation, increasing library complexity and additional factors in education, such as
educational democratization, curriculum change and generational issues. They were able
to teach students how to navigate the new disciplines that were starting to emerge in
academia such as e.g. Ethnic Studies and African-American Literature. The bibliographic
instruction movement was bolstered significantly in the 1970’s by the creation of new
local and national library organizations, such as the American College and Research
Libraries and its Instruction Section (IS) and Library Instruction Round Table (LIRT),
and a variety of books, periodicals, workshops and conferences such as Library
Orientation Exchange (LOEX) which was a conference supporting research and
interaction amongst instruction librarians. With the paradigm shift that occurred in
libraries due to library automation and the advent of the Internet, bibliographic
instruction which had originally been focused on teaching students how to locate printed
information became obsolete. Although it is still common for librarians to present
bibliographic instruction sessions, or one-shots, in college and university library settings,
many college and university libraries have transitioned or are attempting to transition
away from this. Instead they have attempted to either present one-shot information
literacy sessions that integrate information literacy components into courses, develop
bibliographic instruction online tutorials uploaded on the library website or to develop

70

standalone information literacy courses or to ultimately present a combination e.g. oneshots and a one-credit hour information literacy course (Gilton, n.d.; Behrens, 1994).

History of “Information Literacy”

According to Grafstein (2002), the concept of information literacy first came into
use in 1974 by Paul Zurkowski, who coined the term "information literacy" in a muchcited paper, written as President of the Information Industry Association. This was long
before the World Wide Web. The appearance of the term, “information literacy” came
into being in 1989 in the final report on information literacy by the American Library
Association.
However, the most common library instruction format at the time of Zurkowski’s
paper was the one-shot bibliographic instruction session, which was to undergo radical
transformation into what is termed information literacy today. Bibliographic instruction
was then the traditional format of print-based library instruction focused on tool literacy
that taught students how to use the library catalog, the library databases, and print
reference sources and abstracts. Bibliographic instruction and information literacy are
not the same type of instruction. Information literacy instruction is a broad concept that
developed in response to the expansion of information formats and research tools in the
digital age.
This Presidential Committee on Information Literacy's Final Report was chaired
by Patricia Breivik (Breivik & Gee, 1989) who helped to re-conceptualize the concepts
and goals of library instruction as the term now accepted as information literacy. The

71

Final Report established the core definition of information literacy as the ability “to
effectively locate, evaluate, and use information” (American Library Association, 1989).
These various report recommendations, in addition to the Presidential Committee
on Information Literacy Final Report (1989), fueled the funding of information literacy
courses and professional organizations focused on developing an information literacy
agenda to implement adjustments in the American educational system. In addition,
international reports on lifelong learning, such as the Candy Report (1994), contributed to
college and university faculty worldwide using information literacy concepts to better
ensure that their graduates became lifelong learners and entered the workforce with the
skills required for their success. For some colleges and universities, the work of
producing skilled lifelong learners included explicit instruction in information literacy
skills.
This agenda led to a broadening of the definition and theory surrounding the new
concept of information literacy through its inclusion into higher education by the
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards for Libraries in Higher
Education (2000). This definition was expanded to include a more specific and applied
definition that involved the use of technology. The Association of College and Research
Libraries (ACRL) defined information literacy as a set of abilities requiring individuals to
"recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use
effectively the needed information” (2000, p. 2). These standards were later endorsed by
the Council of Independent Colleges (February 2004).

Major Educational Reports Of The 1980’s Influencing Development of Information
Literacy Concepts

There were several major educational reports written in the 1980’s whose findings
aided in shaping school and academic educational systems that emphasized the
importance of information literacy and the need for information literacy programs to
implemented it in classroom settings. Four of these major reports are discussed in the
paragraphs that follow: A Nation at Risk (1983), Newman’s Education Commission of the
States (1985), Libraries and the Search for Academic Excellence (1987) and The
Presidential Committee on Information Literacy Final Report (1989).
A Nation at Risk (1983)
According to A Nation at Risk (1983), a report prepared by the National
Commission on Excellence and created by the then Secretary of Education, widespread
public perception held that something was seriously amiss with education system in the
United States. The National Commission on Excellence (1983) found that the educational
foundations of American society were being eroded and threatened by mediocrity and
that educational institutions appeared to have lost sight of the basic purposes of
schooling.
The Commission found there to be high functional illiteracy rates, lowered SAT
scores, a decline in science achievement scores and low performance on higher order
intellectual skills amongst high school seniors entering colleges, universities and the
workforce. When comparing high school students in the United States to their peers in
economically advanced countries across the world, the students in the United States spent

73

less time in the classroom and doing homework than their international peers. They also
had poor study skills compared with their peers in these advanced countries (National
Commission on Excellence, 1983).
The National Commission on Excellence (1983)
The National Commission on Excellence (1983) pointed out that knowledge,
learning, information and skilled intelligence were the new raw materials of international
commerce. If these raw materials were combined with the resources of a variety of
educational organizations, such as colleges, universities, technical schools, libraries,
museums, cultural institutions and businesses across the United States, there was the
distinct possibility to create a learning society. The learning society created would be able
to provide students and the public with the tools to handle the scientific and technological
changes in occupations that were being transformed by new technology. As a result,
workers needed corporate training, retraining and lifelong learning to be successful in the
work environment.
The National Commission on Excellence (1983) recommended that teachers focus
on the educational process on improving student mastery of taught content, and on
developing rigorous curricula for educational programs that required their students to
spend time studying. Further recommendations included a review and synthesis of
scholarly literature on improving learning and teaching quality in the classroom and on
understanding major events. It was further recommended that problems and barriers to
attaining academic excellence be defined and that United States curricula be compared
with that in economically advanced countries to see where improvements could be made
to the school and college curricula in the United States. College admission standards were

74

sampled in an attempt to identify standards that enhanced and promoted educational
excellence. Expert advice was sought regarding efforts to foster high levels of quality and
academic excellence in schools and in higher education. This was vital at the time and
also applies to the situation for students in higher education today, because it was found
that “attainment rates for young adults in the United States have remained relatively
stagnant at around 40% in the recent past, while college completion among its greatest
competitors has been rapidly increasing” (Advising Committee on Student Financial
Assistance, 2012, p.1). It was suggested that once the National Commission on
Excellence (1983) had completed its research, recommendations would be made to
educators, politicians, governing bodies and public officials about how to improve the
education system in the United States as a whole, so that quality education and academic
excellence in achievement could be better promoted.
Higher Education and the American Resurgence (1985)
Newman’s Higher Education and the American Resurgence (1985) report was
funded by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Newman (1985)
stated that colleges and universities played a major role in aiding the United States in
entering the emerging competition between nations, thereby providing their students with
a quality education as well as moral leadership to help in shaping a better world. Colleges
and universities needed to meet the needs of the American student a decade ahead,
preparing them to be active learners involved in service to their communities.
Newman (1985) stated further that students had to take responsibility for their
own education, become committed citizens, debaters, and researchers who could make
necessary decisions and find acceptable solutions to solve the complex problems of the

75

community and world. Newman’s (1985) report also went on to say that in receiving a
liberal education, students also had to be prepared for civic responsibility and for the
development of a much needed entrepreneurial spirit, which would be important in the
competitive world outside the classroom.
Although the suggestions and recommendations that the A Nation at Risk report
(1983) and Newman’s Higher Education and the American Resurgence (1985) report
made were vitally important for teachers and those in higher education to consider,
neither report addressed “the instruction potential of libraries…the suggestion that not all
learning need take place in classrooms,” or the “direct relationship between libraries and
quality education” (Gee & Breivik, 1987, p. 2).
Libraries and the Search for Academic Excellence (1987)
In their ‘Libraries and Learning’ presentation prepared for A National
Symposium: Libraries and the Search for Academic Excellence, Gee & Breivik (1987)
pointed out that university and college libraries in many educational institutions were not
viewed as a “vital part of the undergraduate experience” (p. 3). Thus, there was still a
large gap between the classroom and the library. Merely being able to develop computer
literacy skills was not enough for the college graduate entering the new information
society, to be successful. Instead, educators had to be compelled to teach their students
the skills that were required for their students to become independent learners and
problem-solvers, such as locating, accessing, retrieving, evaluating and effectively using
information. Being able to apply every one of these skills was essential in the new
information society.

76

According to Gee & Breivik (1987), it was important that academic librarians
work to expand the role of the college and university library on their campuses and aid in
developing a campus climate that encouraged college and university faculty to move
beyond the “reserve-lecture-textbook approach” in the classroom and integrate
information literacy into the curriculum. The faculty had to be encouraged to support an
integrated type of learning that was structured around the information resources that were
available to students even after graduation. The faculty also had to be encouraged to help
their students become lifelong learners by facilitating discovery learning inside and
outside the classroom, thereby allowing their students to develop an awareness of the
information resources available in their specific fields of study and beyond. In this way
students then developed a much more “sophisticated understanding of the library” and its
information resources, and were able to “make use of the wide range of materials
available in and through” their campus libraries (Gee & Breivik, 2007, p. 11). Breivik
(1987) stated that academic libraries needed to fully integrate with the learning process as
they worked for overall improvement of undergraduate education. Breivik (1987) also
pointed out that all college students should be prepared for lifelong learning. Information
Literacy included teaching students the processes of information acquisition, evaluation
and storage. Being able to articulate the public policy issues related to information
literacy was considered to be central to this process and also to transforming and
improving higher education (Breivik, 1987).
The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy Final Report (1989)
In 1989, the American Library Association president, Margaret Chrisholm, then
chair of the American Library Association, Association of College and Research

77

Libraries Section, presented a report to Congress The Presidential Committee on
Information Literacy Final Report (1989), which stated that “information literacy is a
survival skill in the information age” (Association of College and Research Libraries,
1989, Para. 19). The committee found that it was necessary to make information literacy
a part of cultural literacy because it supported democracy. Information Literacy was
viewed as “a means of personal empowerment” that prepared “independent seekers” not
only to become capable searchers and knowledge seekers, but also to become lifelong
learners (Association of College and Research Libraries, 1989, Para. 6).
The committee found that there was a dire need to develop a new learning model
in education that was no longer focused on lectures and textbooks. The suggested
education model would instead be developed to foster self-initiated, active and interactive
real-world information resource-based learning amongst students. The education model
had to be restructured, to include critical thinking and lifelong learning skills. Students
would learn to become effective inquirers, problem-solvers “information consumers,
analyzers, interpreters, evaluators and communicators of ideas” (Para. 32). By applying
this new educational model, students would not only learn information exploration,
connection and evaluation techniques, but would also learn the intricacies involved in
academic research.
The report suggested that a national agenda be developed and implemented that
addressed several significant issues through research. These areas of research included:
the social effects of reading on the populace, how electronic media fit into the print
resources, information resource characteristics, disciplinary information use, access

78

amongst citizen action groups, the effect of information management skills on student
performance, and retention and minority advancement.
In order to accomplish these goals, the report urged educators to incorporate “the
spirit and intent” (The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy Final Report,
1989, Para. 39) of information literacy into college curricula. They were further
encouraged to establish and teach information literacy programs, develop information
literacy competencies in the classroom emphasizing problem-solving within the
disciplines, while assessing their students’ information literacy skills both at the state
level and the college level. Professional and in-service teacher training organizations
were encouraged to train teachers to become learning facilitators, in order to implement
information literacy techniques in the classroom.
There were several recommendations for citizens, educators and businesses across
the nation to be able to “reap the benefits” of information literacy in the future. The
report proposed finding ways to restructure institutional, community, and business
information access. It also advised the establishment of a Coalition for Information
Literacy to raise public awareness and fundraise for coordinating and promoting
information literacy ventures. Another recommendation was that a national information
literacy research agenda be developed, requiring state institutions to teach information
literacy to students at all educational levels.
The information literacy recommendations were approved by the American
Library Association and the Association of College and Research Libraries Section. The
information literacy skills that were emphasized in the Presidential Committee on
Information Literacy Final Report (1989) later became the core of the Association of

79

College and Research Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education
developed in 2000.

Theoretical Framework – Information Literacy

Characteristics of Information Literate People
According to the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy Final Report
(1989), it was important that the quality of a college be measured by the resources for
learning available to students on the campus and also by the extent to which students
became independent, self-directed learners. The authors of A Nation at Risk (1983)
emphasized the dire need to revitalize American education, asserting that there was a
widespread public perception that something was seriously amiss with the education
system in the United States. Thus, it was reiterated that the gap between the classroom
and the library continued to exist, since undergraduates spend little or no time in the
library during a normal week, with 65% using the library for only four hours or less each
week. According to The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy Final Report
(1989) it was important that “the first step in reducing this gap” was “making sure that
the issue of' information literacy” became “an integral part of current efforts at cultural
literacy, the development of critical thinking abilities, and school restructuring” (Para.
23). Thus, it was necessary to define the character of the information literate person. In
describing the characteristics of the information literate person, The Presidential
Committee on Information Literacy Final Report (1989) states that “it must be clear that
teaching facts is a poor substitute for teaching people how to learn, i.e., giving them the
skills to be able to locate, evaluate, and effectively use information for any given need.
80

What was then called for was not a new information studies curriculum but, rather, for
the restructuring of the learning process at schools, colleges and universities throughout
the United States. The Report stated that information literacy character development
consisted of actively teaching students to develop skills allowing them to:





Know when they had a need for information
Identify the information they needed to address a given problem or issue
Find the needed information and evaluate the information gathered
Organize the information they gathered and use the information organized and
gathered to “effectively to address the problem or issue at hand (The Presidential
Committee on Information Literacy Final Report, 1989, Para. 27).

These changes would restructure the learning process to enhance the critical thinking
skills of students, their empowerment for lifelong learning and their “effective
performance of professional and civic responsibilities” (The Presidential Committee on
Information Literacy Final Report, 1989, Para. 27). Ultimately, as information literate
students would develop into a scholars and researchers who are competent to conduct
research in a technology-rich, ever-changing environment, inside and outside the
university setting.
Christine Bruce (1995) stated that information literacy should be viewed as a
theoretical framework for higher education because it was one of four elements essential
to undergraduate education. Bruce (1995) defined information literacy as “the ability to
access, evaluate and use information from a variety of sources” (p.159) and stated further
that the theoretical information literacy framework tied and addressed three important
elements together within the information literacy agenda that were of primary concern to
educators. The first element was developing the outcomes of information literacy courses
to be taught and the outlining the characteristics of information literate people. The
second element was considering the actual nature of information literacy education and

81

how it was provided to the student. The third element was understanding the roles of
stakeholders in education and the best ways that they could work together to help
students to become information literate (Bruce, 1995).
According to Bruce (1995), information literate people were those who had
learned how to learn. They were self-directed, lifelong learners who took responsibility
for their own learning and used information technology systems and resources to
facilitate information retrieval. They knew how information was organized, where and
how to access it and used appropriate search strategies to find information, and knew how
to organize it to fulfill their specific information needs in such a way, that others could
learn from them. Information literate people were able to recognize their information
need, and also understand what source types and formats they needed at specific times.
They were critical thinkers, information evaluators, information synthesizers and
problem-solvers, able to use the information effectively for whatever project or paper
they were working on and create new knowledge as needed. Information literate people
were people that had attitudes “such as persistence, attention to detail and skepticism”
and the “appreciation of the value and power of information” (Bruce, 1995, p. 161).
Bruce (1995) also suggested that in order for students to become information literate, it
was important that faculty collaborate with one another to integrate information literacy
into the curriculum, so that it is possible to “evaluate it along with other aspects of the
curriculum” (p.165).

82

Information Literacy in Higher Education
Spitzer, Eisenberg & Lowe (1998) described the milestones in the development of
information literacy in the United States by explaining that information literacy was
shaped by the democratic ideals of the 1970’s, the growth and acceleration of computer
networks in the 1980’s and the creation of watchdog organizations such as the National
Forum on Information Literacy in 1989 and the Institute for Information Literacy in
1998. The definition of information literacy was formalized by the American Library
Association in 1989 when the Presidential Committee on Information Literacy defined an
information literate person as a student-scholar and researcher who was competent to
conduct research in a technology-rich, ever-changing environment, inside and outside the
university setting and laid down the foundation on which the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000) was built.
According to Orr, Appleton & Wallin (2001) information literacy was crosscurricular, connected to the curriculum and to every subject taught by an institution and
to the process of continuous or lifelong learning. Information literacy was defined as “a
way of thinking and reasoning about subject matter” (p. 457). Information literacy
courses should be structured so that inquiry was the norm, so that the focus becomes
learning how to problem-solve and critical thinking is a part of the process of the course,
ultimately allowing students to then become engaged in their own self-directed learning,
and the expansion of their knowledge and sharpen their questioning skills.
Johnston & Webber (2003) pointed out that over the last thirty years the
international profile of information literacy had grown, becoming “an appropriate vehicle
for integrating responses to the information society from the library, computer and
pedagogical societies” (p.340). As a result, information literacy had moved beyond the
83

mere “search and find skills and IT fluency characterizations” and now required an
“integration into the curriculum structure of higher education” (p.340), where application
in the classroom was a necessity. Although information literacy has come a long way
since the creation of the Association of College and Research Libraries (2000), and its
underlying concepts were refined, redefined and reorganized countless times so that
information literacy models could be created and a substantial section of the higher
education community had embraced these concepts, students were still struggling to
apply their information literacy to their daily lives.
Project Information Literacy (PIL) (2013) in collaboration with the University of
Washington I-school, conducted a large-scale, multi-year study about the research habits
of young adults. During this study six information literacy-related investigations were
conducted between 2008 and 2012, surveying and interviewing more than 11,000
students from 57 colleges and universities. Their findings indicated that very little was
known about how college students put their information literacy competencies to work in
practice outside the classroom. It was clear that most college graduates were not
information literate, since the findings indicated that students who had been surveyed and
interviewed while enrolled in college continued to experience challenges after college.
Noteworthy findings included (Project Information Literacy, 2013):
:




Eighty percent of college students had great difficulty determining the
nature and scope of their research assignments and starting them;
Fifty percent of college students were uncertain when concluding and
assessing their research assignments;
Students used tried and true solutions when conducting research and used
Google as opposed to the library databases (used by only 11% of
students), with only 78% of college students valuing the databases as
credible content that could be used for research;

84





Eighty percent of respondents did not turn to librarians for help with
defining their research topics or with course-related assignments; 49% of
students turned to their instructors for help and the rest turned to friends
and family when they were considering or researching personal topics; and
Eighty-five percent of students were “light” technology users, since they
only used one to two devices that helped them with their complete their
assignments, with 40% of the devices used being a cell-phone and a laptop
computer

PIL demonstrated that there was still a great deal of work to be done by librarians
in the classroom as they developed information literacy courses and programs in order to
prepare their students to graduate with a skillset useful in the workplace. Their ongoing
work was aimed at improving their students’ information literacy skills so that they were
information literate enough to complete their college work and graduate.
Stakeholder Roles in Information Literacy Development
A stakeholder is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online (2016) as an
individual “that had a stake in an enterprise” and also someone “that was ultimately
involved in and affected by a specific course of action.” Christine Bruce, originator of the
model the Seven Faces of Information Literacy, described the roles played by
stakeholders in the information literacy program (Bruce, 1994). The information literacy
program stakeholders at a university were those who were directly affected by the
program, from its conception to its implementation and assessment, and suggested, as did
Breivik (1991) that they had “pedagogical expertise, subject expertise and expertise in
information organization and technology” (p.13). Bruce (1994) described the stakeholder
roles of administrators, faculty, staff developers, learning counselors and information
services professionals in the information literacy program in some depth in Information
Literacy Blueprint. Bruce (1994) suggested that it was important for librarians to develop
collaborative strategic relationships with stakeholders in administration such as deans,
85

provosts or members of different university boards and committees. They were
responsible for fostering a university climate that promoted collaboration and oversaw
university budgets and policy creation. They also created the university infrastructure for
teaching and learning, necessary for the development of the information literacy course,
course staffing and the policies related to it. Librarians were also at an advantage when
establishing strategic partnerships and collaborations with subject faculty, since they had
a stake in the development of an information literacy course, or in the integration of
information literacy into their disciplines because they could work with librarians to
develop appropriate teaching content and assessments that would be a complementary to
their disciplines. Librarians also had the opportunity in some cases to co-teach an
information literacy course that was discipline specific or if the information literacy was
integrated and the discipline-specific courses were online, to embed information literacy
into these courses. Bruce (1994) also suggested that university staff were also
stakeholders and that their role, in terms of the information literacy course, was to raise
consciousness about information literacy among the university staff to establish the need
for learning more about information literacy through on-campus forums or presentations.
Student learning counselors also needed to be made aware of information literacy course
offerings and how information literacy had been integrated into the courses at the
university, so that they were able to counsel students about information literacy
requirements. Bruce (2004) suggested that these counselors could intervene at any level
of the teaching and learning process, since they were able to help students who were
transferring into a college from another and needed a bridging course that included

86

information literacy, or they were able to provide students with whatever learning support
was needed.
Information services staff, such as instructional technologists, were also important
stakeholders in information literacy because the librarians often needed to work with a
course designer or an instructional designer in order to create course content when new
information literacy courses were designed, or a course was revised, or when a librarian
was embedded into a course where information literacy was being taught. Students were
also stakeholders because they took the courses where they were exposed to information
literacy, and participated in the information literacy learning process at different levels of
their college experience. As a result, they provided the information literacy librarian and
instructor with assessment data and vital information about what changes and
improvements to make to the course or program in the future. According to Bruce (2004)
information literacy education was impossible without the development of collaborations
and partnerships in the educational setting. It was considered the responsibility of the
information literacy librarian/instructor to develop strategic partnerships that operated at
various levels in the educational setting. Fostering these strategic partnerships with
faculty and staff stakeholders involved curriculum design, policy development, staff
development, and research and classroom teaching since these areas were all necessary
for the viability of the information literacy program.
Saunders (2012) conducted a study about faculty perspectives of information
literacy as a learning outcome. The study was conducted because the American
Association of Colleges & Universities Liberal Education (AAC&U) and America’s
Promise (LEAP) supporting documents, standards and rubrics, “demonstrated that

87

stakeholders recognize information literacy as an important learning outcome essential to
a broad education” (p.226). Nevertheless, findings in the literature had suggested that
undergraduate students at large universities where information literacy had become a
stated learning outcome, whether in the general education, or integrated into the
disciplines, lacked the competencies associated with information literacy, because little
progress had been made beyond the one-shot information literacy class. As a result,
Saunders (2012) attempted to better understand and analyze this problem, by
interviewing disciplinary faculty stakeholders who had direct oversight and responsibility
for the curriculum and how information literacy was taught, to ascertain their awareness
of information literacy. The survey which was followed up with a six-question interview
contained questions about faculty awareness of information literacy standards, the
competencies and skills taught by information literacy, the appropriateness of these skills
and competencies for addressing their students’ needs and assignment of responsibility
for teaching information literacy to their students within their discipline. The survey was
followed by a random sampling of 50 colleges and universities with undergraduate
majors in six fields: (1) Anthropology, (2) Science, (3) Technology, (4) Psychology, (5)
English Literature and (6) Political Science. This part of the study was conducted because
the Association of College and Research Libraries taskforces had created five sets of
discipline specific information literacy standards for those six disciplines in 2011. Eight
hundred and thirty-four surveys were sent out and only 278 responses were received with
the largest number of responses being received from psychology (33.6%) and biology
(32.4%) faculty and the smallest from technology (10.4%) faculty. The total survey
response rate was 33.3%. The study findings indicated that when rating student abilities

88

and competencies between 100-110 participants said that they considered the largest
areas of student gains to be in identifying scholarly materials, identifying authoritative
reliable sources, finding relevant materials for papers and citing sources appropriately
and correctly. When responding to the question about who was responsible for teaching
information literacy in the disciplines 185 participants strongly agreed that the
responsibility was that of the teaching faculty and not librarians, but they also agreed that
it was a shared responsibility which needed to be taught to students in different ways and
in different places.
Faculty stakeholders who understood the ACRL Standards (2000) and were more
willing to work with librarians to implement information literacy content in their courses
often did not include information literacy in their classes because of large class sizes and
time constraints, and did not assign research papers in their classes. Consequently,
information literacy was not included in the course content. The faculty was willing to
collaborate with librarians when necessary to integrate information literacy into their
disciplines, but they did not see librarians as teaching or instruction partners, even though
they were willing to work with them to create course content. Saunders (2012) also found
that the unwillingness of faculty to partner with librarians in creating information literacy
course content was less about lack of respect, as it was about having much more to do
with their not knowing how to contribute to and support the information literacy
instruction. Faculty stakeholders were very aware that although information literacy did
consist of a set of baseline competencies that were transferable or cross-disciplinary,
these competencies differed within the disciplines; thus faculty suggested “that a more
systematic and developmental approach to teaching information literacy” (p.231) be

89

required within their discipline. Saunders (2012) concluded that librarians still had
opportunities to collaborate with faculty in order to create information literacy
opportunities for students and also that librarians still had not found “systematic ways to
integrate” information literacy “into the curriculum” (p.232). When information literacy
integration did happen, there was often less opportunity for students to learn information
literacy skills, when one-shots were common at their universities. These limited librarian
interaction with students and also the amount of information literacy instruction that
could be provided when librarians saw students infrequently and often for less than 30
minutes, once or twice a year.
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy
for Higher Education (2016) and the Information Literacy Course
The theoretical underpinnings of the new Association of College and Research
Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) have been a
concern for librarians since the first draft of the new Framework was released. This was
because Mackey & Jacobsen (2011) chose Meyer & Land’s (2003) threshold concepts to
explain why instructors should shift their roles and practices when teaching information
literacy to their students in the classroom. These threshold concepts are not derived from
the discipline of library science, in fact, as Beilin (2015) so aptly explains, librarians are
critical of “applying the threshold concepts because they” reflect “theory imported from
other disciplines into library practice” and “into LIS scholarship. Beilin (2015) points out
that-- even though the theoretical jargon comes from other disciplines where studies have
been conducted around the threshold concepts such as English Literature, Sociology and
Education into Library Science, information literacy instructors should not be averse to
adopting and adapting these “novel concepts and ideas, reflected in new vocabulary” into
90

the field and that they instead “should engage…in order “to test their foundations as well
as their usefulness” (Beilin, 2015, Para 8).
According to the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education website (2015), the Framework (2016) itself
grew “out of a belief that information literacy as an educational reform movement”
would “realize its potential only through a richer, more complex set of core ideas”
(Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education Website, 2015, Para.1). Because of “the rapidly changing higher
education environment” and “the dynamic and often uncertain information ecosystem in
which all of us work and live…new attention” had to be “focused on foundational ideas
about that ecosystem” that were provided by the Framework (2016) (Association of
College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education Website, Para. 1). There was also a need for instructors and students to take on
roles as new knowledge creators, who fostered an “understanding” of “the contours and
the changing dynamics of the world of information” and scholarly processes. It was
therefore important to continue to develop this new Framework since library practitioners
were entering a new paradigm where they had greater responsibility in “designing
curricula and assignments that” fostered and “enhanced engagement with the core ideas
about information and scholarship within their disciplines“ that would extend students
learning by “creating a new cohesive curriculum for information literacy, and in
collaborating more extensively with faculty” (Association of College and Research
Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education Website, Para. 1).

91

The new Framework (2016) was marketed by Mackey & Jacobsen (2011) as a
model that helped instructors transition from the print-based culture to the Web-based
culture, by moving away from merely teaching students how to use the library’s
resources and databases, and moving towards developing the students’ problem-solving
and critical literacy abilities and resourcefulness and in the process, taking their
dispositions into account.

Information Literacy Development in Colleges and Universities

This expanded definition seems straightforward, yet it mapped a new course for
libraries, allowing them to operate in the higher education landscape under the auspices
of a discipline. This definition expanded the parameters of what counted as “information”
and altered the way student learning was assessed and valued. It has also resulted in a
codification and distribution of learning through designated courses in information
literacy. This definition also allowed librarians to contribute to the teaching of student
academic writing skills in colleges and universities.
Lilli Li (2007) found that information literacy skill requirements, focused
primarily on developing a student’s reading and writing abilities had to be hugely
expanded with the advent of the digital age, to encompass a dauntingly comprehensive
range of knowledge management and technology skills in order to achieve these
enhanced academic writing abilities. As a result, the importance of the information
literacy agenda and its application in colleges and universities was discussed and hotly
debated, in both the education and Library Science literature in higher education.
However, government reports and funded research projects continued to focus on
92

improvements in the United States public educational system and promoting information
literacy in the public school classroom, starting in the 1980’s.

Changes in Information Literacy Instruction

William Badke (2008) stated that although the information literacy movement had
grown substantially since the development of the Association of College and Research
Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000), there
have been many problems with the implementation of information literacy at colleges and
universities in the United States.
Image Easy Solutions and EasyBib.com (2014), a citation creator and a library
vendor, conducted a joint survey on information literacy trends in academia. The survey
yielded 10,471 responses, (see Table 1.6). The survey found that 60% of librarian survey
respondents said that their students preferred to use Google and the open web in
comparison to the academic library’s resources and authoritative journals when searching
for resources for their papers. Librarians’ perspectives were confirmed by student
responses when asked whether they preferred to use the open web in comparison to the
academic library’s resources, 58.7% of students agreed that they preferred using Google
and the open web, instead of their academic library’s authoritative resources when
searching for resources to use in their academic papers. When asked about the
frequencies of student struggles on the Image Easy Solutions Survey (2014) with direct
quotes and paraphrasing when writing their academic papers, 35% of students admitted
that they struggled moderately with direct quotes and paraphrasing, while only five
percent admitted that they struggled very often with direct quotes and paraphrasing, while
93

55% claimed that they rarely struggled with quotes and paraphrasing when writing their
papers. In comparison, when librarians were asked about how students struggled with
direct quotes and paraphrasing in their academic papers, they stated that only three
percent of their students rarely struggled with these tasks, while 52% struggled
moderately with these tasks and 45% struggled very often with these tasks (Image Easy
Solutions, 2014). The Image Easy Solutions Survey (2014) asked students in 2012 and
2014 how important librarian roles were in developing student research and critical
thinking skills. In 2012, 97% of students stated that librarian critical thinking and
research roles were extremely important. In 2014 student opinions regarding librarian
research and critical thinking roles had changed significantly in favor of depending on
their subject professors who were faculty, instead of academic librarians for guidance
with research and critical thinking. According to the Image Easy Solutions Survey
(2014), 53% of students (a drop of 44%) stated that librarian critical thinking and
research roles were extremely important, 43% stated (a drop of 41%) that these librarian
roles were “pretty important, but faculty has influence” and four percent of students
stated (a gain of three percent) that these library roles were not important.
Image Easy Solutions Survey (2014) findings, as described in Table 2.1 were that
the “one-shot” (one presentation) instruction method has remained the most popular
instruction method in all types of schools. However, between 2012 and 2014 there was a
decrease in the one-shot method of instruction by two percent, and an increase of nearly
eight percent in schools offering students a combination of one-shot and full information
literacy course options. There was also a seven percent increase in schools that did not
offer any type of information literacy instruction. When compared with 2014, the number

94

of information literacy courses in development had decreased from 18% in 2012 to five
percent, and the number of schools that did not offer any information literacy courses at
all had increased to ten percent, largely because of library budget and job cuts
synonymous with a poor economy.

A new approach to information literacy was developed as a response to the twin
competing forces of decreased budgets and increased need for information literacy
instruction to increase student academic writing skills – the Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016). It was created to supplement the Association of
College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education (2000). The new philosophy and allied strategies for information literacy were
developed by librarians on the Association of College and Research Libraries

95

Information Literacy Standards Committee (2014). It provided a new theoretical outline
and mapped out methods, strategies, and applications for the incorporation of information
literacy courses and curricula in colleges and universities. A decision was made to place
the new Framework side-by-side with the Association of College and Research
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) in order to
strengthen its force.

The Exemplary Information Literacy Course

Kasowitz-Scheer & Pasqualoni (2002) introduced the Association of College and
Research Libraries’ “Best Practices Initiative Institute for Information Literacy” and
pointed out that it offered “the most complete set of best practices characteristics” that
emphasized “the importance of integrating information literacy throughout a student’s
entire academic career” (p. 3) and advised librarians to use multiple methods of
assessment in their courses.
The new Best Practices Initiative Institute for Information Literacy was approved
by the Association of College and Research Libraries Board in 2002 and revised in 2012.
“The Characteristics of Programs of Information Literacy that Illustrate Best Practices: A
Guideline” attempted to articulate elements of exemplary information literacy programs
for undergraduate students at four- and two-year institutions (Association of College and
Research Libraries, Characteristics of Programs of Information Literacy that Illustrate
Best Practices, 2015). These documents have not been revised since 2012, and the
exemplary program college list has remained the same and no new exemplary programs

96

were identified and acknowledged in the last five years because the Association of
College and Research Libraries ended the program.
The original “Guidelines” were created in 2000 and was developed through a
multi-phase process using a web-based Delphi poll with input from librarians and
administrators from all levels of higher education. It was revised again at a 2002
invitational Best practices in Information Literacy Conference, in which its
characteristics were redefined in order to create a final document. In the second phase, a
project team from eight universities and colleges publicized and promoted the document.
The document became a working document and has been continually revised since 2012
by the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices
Committee.
The Committee consisted of 13 Association of College and Research Libraries
members from different colleges and universities selected to serve voluntarily on the
committee, these individuals also belong to the Instruction Section. Each year a call was
sent out to information literacy courses that exemplified best practices to submit their
course characteristics to the committee for consideration. A rubric was created for course
and programs to use, to see how close each course or program measured up to the
information literacy best practices characteristics.
Information literacy programs were chosen from those libraries responding to the
call each year that had to be a best fit for the 10 best practices categories in the rubric.
Institutions could choose more than one of the categories to fit their program. The best
characteristics were divided into ten categories as described in Table 2.2. The college
provided a short description of how their program fit a category; while other colleges

97

chose other categories described in the exemplary rubric, which was then vetted by the
Committee, and is included in Appendix G.
The colleges and universities included in the study are named in Table 2.2. Each
of the eight institutions was listed on the Association of College and Research Libraries
Information Literacy Best Practices website and had an exemplary information literacy
course or program that was recognized for information literacy best practices. The table
provides the name of the university or college is provided, as well as its library, location,
and the exemplary categories in which it was recognized by the Association of College
and Research Libraries.

These Standards defined information literacy as “a set of abilities requiring
individuals to recognize when information was needed and therefore the information
literate individual would have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the
needed information” (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000, Para. 3).
In the Guidelines for Instruction Programs in Academic Libraries (2011),
librarians were advised that the Association of College and Research Libraries
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) were created as
a “guide” to generate “campus discussion,” which allowed educators to easily “identify
the big picture” (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2011, p. 3) of
information literacy. It also emphasized that the Association of College and Research
Libraries Objectives (2011) were to be used “to breakdown the overall objectives” of an
information literacy program into “specific discrete measurable results” (Objectives for
Information Literacy Instruction: a model statement for academic librarians, 2011, p. 2)
before creation. According to the Guidelines for Instruction Programs in Academic
Libraries (2011), academic libraries had to develop written mission statements that
clearly stated the purpose and context of an information literacy program prior to its
design and development. Librarians then explained how their information literacy
program would address with the mission of their institution and how it would align with
the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education (2000), once developed and implemented.
The five Association of College and Research Libraries Section Information
Literacy Standards (2000) were created to be applied in every information literacy
program designed by librarians and teachers in the educational setting. A student who

100

was “information literate” was a person who was “able to recognize when information is
needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed
information” (Association of College and Research Libraries, 1989, Para. 3). The
information literate student:
1. Determines the nature and extent of the information needed
2. Accesses needed information effectively and efficiently
3. Evaluates information and its sources critically and incorporates selected
information into his or her knowledge base and value system
4. Individually or as a member of a group, uses information effectively to
accomplish a specific purpose
5. Understands many of the economic, legal and social issues surrounding the
use of information and accesses and uses information ethically and legally
(Association of College and Research Libraries, 1989, Para. 3).
The Association of College and Research Libraries ended the Exemplary Program
because of the major changes that have taken place post-print. Suggestions were made
that librarians change how information literacy is taught using the Association of College
and Research Libraries Standards (2000)) as a guide, and by rescinding these Standards,
librarians were given no option but to transition into using the new Framework for
information literacy for Higher Education (2016) as a guide for their courses. Because
many institutions had already invested a great deal in applying the Association of College
and Research Libraries (2000) Standards in their courses and programs, because the
exemplary program guidelines had a strong connection to the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000), the paradigm shift has been grudgingly accepted by
some and rejected by others. There is much concern in the field about starting over with
the process to get faculty to buy-in to the new Framework (2016), so that they can
reconstruct courses and replace the “old” with the “new.”

101

National Forum on Information Literacy

In 1989, the American Library Association created the National Forum on
Information Literacy as “an umbrella group of national organizations committed to
turning people into effective information consumers” (Breivik, 1993, p. 48) in order to
strengthen and support ALA’s information literacy initiative.
According to the mission statement on the National Forum on Information
Literacy (2013) website, it “evolved into one of the pre-eminent advocacy organizations
dedicated to mainstreaming information literacy philosophy and practice worldwide”
(Para. 1). The National Forum on Information Literacy website (2013) documented the
milestones of the information literacy initiative since its formation, stressing that several
major educational organizations, such as the Association of Supervision and Curriculum
Development, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, United Nations
Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization, and the National Education Association
were committed to the importance of information literacy and to embedding information
literacy into their learning outcomes.
A final report on Information Literacy was published, documenting ten years of
implementation of the information literacy Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000) across the United States and, more specifically, in educational settings,
such as schools, colleges and universities. A Progress Report on Information Literacy: An
update on the American Library Association Presidential Committee on Information
Literacy: Final Report (Association of College and Research Libraries, 1998) outlined
the progress that had been made on the six recommendations that had been proffered in

102

the American Library Association-Association of College and Research Libraries (1989)
Report. The report recommended that:
1. Information be organized institutionally, providing structured information
access, so that there was a defined informational structure in the lives people, at home, in
the community, and in the workplace. This was an ongoing process that was taking place
within organizations associated with the National Forum for Information Literacy, such
as the American Library Association, the Association of College and Research Libraries
and the Association of Research Libraries.
2. A Coalition for Information Literacy be formed under the leadership of the
American Library Association, in coordination with other national organizations and
agencies, in order to promote information literacy. To date, the National Forum for
Information Literacy came into existence and remains the watchdog organization for
information literacy and related issues.
3. Research and demonstration projects related to information and its use be
undertaken. To date, thousands of articles about a variety of topics related to information
literacy exists in the Education and Library Science research literature.
4. State Departments of Education, Commissions on Higher Education and
Academic Governing Boards be responsible to ensure that a climate conducive to student
information literacy exist in their states and on their school, college and university
campuses. Accrediting agencies have elevated the status of information literacy in higher
education to some extent, however, unless colleges or universities have an agenda when
meeting accreditation standards that includes information literacy in the curriculum then
in that case educators placed a greater emphasis on pushing the information literacy

103

teaching agenda at their colleges/universities. If the agenda was less emphasized and less
acceptable to administrators, then instructors had a much harder time implementing
information literacy in any format at their campuses.
5. Teacher education and performance expectations should be modified to include
information literacy concerns. To date, the American Association of School Librarians
developed their own information literacy standards that were largely used by teachers in
the school setting, but since academic librarians have used the Association of College and
Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education
(2000) for information literacy course development, and since many library schools do
not do teacher training, per se, this is not an area that would be emphasized, except by
those library schools that have developed programs of study for academic librarians, and
that offer courses that emphasize learning how to teach information literacy to these
student librarians.
6. An understanding of the relationship of information literacy to the themes of
the White House Conference on Library and Information Services should be promoted. In
October 2009, a presidential proclamation to promote information literacy in the United
States was released that made October of that year, National Information Literacy
Awareness Month (National Forum on Information Literacy, 2012).
The report also urged strengthening the implementation of information literacy in
the United States and making educators aware of the importance of providing students
with technology and resources to empower students to apply their information literacy
skills. It’s authors advocated for the creation of a National Forum on Information
Literacy that would reach out to government, business and educational organizations to

104

foster further research projects into information literacy-related topics. Finally, the report
suggested developing a plan for working with national teacher education programs in
order to “infuse” information literacy “requirements into undergraduate and graduate
programs of teacher education” (Association of College and Research Libraries, 1998,
Para. 14).

Broadening Information literacy

According to Behrens (1994), there was a wider significance to the concept of
information literacy that went beyond library science, where the focus was on defining
the concept of literacy. Information literacy was therefore expanded so that it became an
umbrella term that described many different types of literacies, as was expounded in the
theories of Mackey & Jacobson (2011). Bawden (2001) defined ‘literacy’ as “the ability
to use language in its written form, where a literate person is able to read, write and
understand their native language” (Para. 14). When further defining literacy Bawden
(2001) stated that in relation to information literacy, there were six skill-based literacies
that were often mentioned synonymously with information literacy, which also widened
the scope and meaning of the term. These literacies were: computer literacy, library
literacy, digital literacy, media literacy, media literacy and network literacy (also often
called Internet and hyper literacy).
Information literacy has broadened substantially with the development of the new
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016), because as part of it, the metaliteracy theory, which was largely
developed by researchers, Mackey and Jacobson (2011), has evolved. Metaliteracy
105

expanded “the scope of information literacy as more than a set of discrete skills,
challenging us to rethink information literacy as active knowledge production and
distribution in collaborative online communities” (Mackey & Jacobsen, 2011, p.64). That
way, the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016) included five types of literacy that were identified
as information literacy. These include media literacy, digital literacy, cyberliteracy, visual
literacy and information fluency.
Media literacy is defined by Mackey & Jacobson (2011) as “the ability of a
citizen to access, analyze, and produce information for specific outcomes” (p.64 while
digital literacy is defined as having “the ability to access networked computer resources
and use them” (p.64). Digital literacy and cyberliteracy were related but were not the
same literacy concept. According to Mackey & Jacobson (2011) cyberliteracy focused on
the user developing the ability to become an active participant in the discussion about
technology and the Internet, being able to think critically about issues such as Internet
and more specifically, about issues such as copyright and the policies and politics
affecting active Internet use. Visual literacy, in turn, was defined as the ability not only to
sort and interpret visual action and visual symbols but also to evaluate and use visual
sources e.g. art, graphic art. When compared with information literacy, Mackey &
Jacobson (2011) stated that information fluency shared the same goals for boosting the
user’s comprehension levels and engagement in computer literacy as information literacy
did, but instead of focusing on critical thinking, it was defined as “a set of intellectual
capabilities, conceptual knowledge, and contemporary skills associated with information
technology” (p.66). In the new media environment, when conducting research, students

106

needed not only to “determine the extent of information needed, but also the format and
delivery mode of the information itself” (p.70), making the development of courses
emphasizing metaliteracy vital to every student who graduated from college.
With the development of the Association of College and Research Libraries
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000), information
literacy was broadened to include the outcomes that colleges and universities needed to
develop their information literacy programs. Each of the five sections of the standards
outcomes focused on specific information literacy concepts important to the information
search process: articulation of information need, finding information, selection of
information, information use and ethical use of information.
Applying these concepts in the classroom setting was made much simpler with the
development of a number of major information literacy models. Table 2.3, below,
provides some examples of the more well-known information search process models that
were created and were well documented in both the library science and education
literature (Lamb & Johnson, 2001).
Researchers developed two model types: 1) information literacy models that
explained to librarians the information search process, and 2) information literacy models
that explained the process of users becoming information literate. Neither of these models
were to be seen as a direct process to follow step-by-step. Instead, both the search process
and the process to become information literate allowed multiple viewpoints and entry
points. Students could start and stop, go back and forth as needed in order to retrace steps
in any order to process through the search process, as well as to move toward becoming
information literate.

107

Both types of models were extremely useful to librarians because they could
choose one or both models from the research literature and apply them in the classroom
setting when they were working with students. In fact, information literacy curriculum
has often been developed around one or more of these models. These models not only
helped librarians to see where in the process their students were struggling, but they also
helped improve their scaffolding with students (Lamb & Johnson, 2001).
The information search process models were similar in that they described a
similar process, but they often deviated substantially in theoretical approach. The Big 6
Model developed by Eisenberg (Eisenberg & Berkowitz, 1987) and Kulthau’s
Information Search Process (1999) model were both examples of information search
process models. The Big 6 model was developed at the University of Washington as a
problem-solving model that could be applied by instructors to students of all ages
(Eisenberg & Berkowitz, 1987). This model encouraged teaching collaborations between
librarians and faculty and it had six stages that researchers completed to solve their
problem and move through the stages from task definition all the way to evaluation. In
comparison, Kulthau’s (1991) information search process model had seven stages that
researchers muddled through starting with initiation and ending in assessing their task.

models worked and could be applied in the classroom setting to develop outcomes that
guided the information literacy instructor’s teaching.
Kuhlthau (1991) also attached a range of feelings to each of the stages, describing
the emotional process that researchers faced when using the library to find resources and
use them to do a project or write a paper. Table 2.3 used five models and walked through
three information literacy components by comparing them to one another, explaining how
the information literacy
This table was developed by Uribe-Tirado & Munoz (2012) to compare three of
the concepts found in the Association of College Research Libraries Information Literacy

110

Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) with four other information literacy
models used by librarians in different countries that also applied these information
literacy concepts.
Uribe-Tirado & Munoz’s (2012) Table 2.4 compared the Association of College
and Research Libraries Standards with the Information Literacy Indicators from
International Federation of Library Associations/United Nations Education Scientific and
Cultural Organization (2006), the Canadian model and Council of Australian Librarians
(2001), the British model, Big Blue (2002) on which the current British Society of
College, National and University Libraries (SCONUL) model was based and the
Australian and New Zealand model, A New Curriculum for Information Literacy (2004).
All of them were describing the process researchers went through to become information
literate.
Uribe-Tirado & Munoz (2012) carried out a qualitative analysis on the three
information literacy components: access, evaluation and use. They compared these
components when looking at the models developed for use worldwide, where in all of
these, educators were using them as information literacy training cycle models (UribeTirado & Munoz, 2012). When examining the access components in the five information
literacy models in Table 2.3, there were clear similarities in terms of the focusing on
thinking through the information need, conceptualizing it and understanding it. In
comparison to the International Federation of Library Associations/United Nations
Education Scientific and Cultural Organization model, the emphasis was placed on the
evaluation of information and also on the researcher’s early process search for quality
information (Uribe-Tirado & Munoz, 2012).

111

In comparing the evaluation of an information component in Table 2.4, it became
clear that the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) was missing something important.
When compared with the other models, redrafting, manipulation and storage of
information were considered as an important part of the information evaluation process,
whereas the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) did not mention these activities at
all. The “information literacy use component” detailed by the American College and
Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education
(2000) appeared to be rather inflexible, in that they were focused on use as being rather
project specific. The Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) never went as far as the Canadian
and New Zealand models did in explaining that, in the information literacy teaching
context the instructor would do well to focus on teaching students how to reframe
information, work collaboratively in groups, and emphasize the importance of using and
adapting their prior knowledge along with the knowledge they had gathered, to create
new concepts and understandings along with developing or creating new or improved
projects.
However, the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) did measure up to the other models
in the table in terms of the emphasis on ethics in the classroom, which not only involves
teaching students to counter plagiarism, but also to understand complex ethical issues
related to the Internet and social media, such as music pirating or uploading lewd videos.

Information Literacy Course Models

According to Mbabu (2007), institutions with information literacy programs that
were governed by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education implemented the
Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education (2000) when developing their undergraduate information
literacy courses. Even though the outcomes were related to the Standards, all of the
information literacy curricula that were developed had different learning goals and
objectives. There were two major information literacy course models: the (1) separate or
the “compartmentalized” (Mbabu, 2007) information literacy curriculum model and (2)
the integrated or distributed curriculum model that were most commonly used in the
classroom.
When considering the separate or compartmentalized curriculum as described in
Figure 2.1, then the information literacy course in question could be taught as a standalone course. It could be offered to students taking the course in the earliest stages of
their general education program in their liberal arts core program or during or after taking
the first semester of coursework during their freshman year.

The stand-alone course could take the format of a one-shot course, the traditional
library instruction format that was developed to help students navigate the library by
accessing materials and evaluating the materials. Often, in standalone situations, the
librarian created the course and offered it when specific faculty requested that the
librarian visit their classroom for half the class period or the full class period to present
library instruction. In such situations, the faculty member could choose to stay in the
classroom or leave the classroom and let the librarian to work with students; but in the
latter situation there was often limited collaboration that happened between the students
and the librarian. In other standalone situations, the librarians often insisted that library
instruction was necessary at the college or university and administration then allowed
them to make visits to faculty classroom settings even when faculty did not want their
students to participate in the one-shot session (Mbabu, 2007).

115

For a separate or compartmentalized curriculum, the Australian information
literacy model, A New Curriculum for Information Literacy (Seeker & Coonan, 2011),
described several additional information literacy course structures that had been adapted
for teaching in Australian educational settings over the past few years. One of them, the
unit or modular course, fitted the compartmentalized curriculum and consisted of ongoing
standalone classes that met and developed the needs of students during their entire
academic career. These courses were not one-shots, but were specific, paced information
literacy modules that were dispersed and then taught at particular points throughout the
undergraduate student’s four-year degree. A curriculum was developed so that these
holistic modules were implemented to support the student, providing not just library
instruction, but information literacy at crucial times during the student’s entire period of
study at point of need when it was most required (Seeker & Coonan, 2011).
The integrated or distributed model involved partnerships between faculty
members and academic librarians who would collaborate to integrate information literacy
into the curriculum. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education (2003)
described this integrated model for information literacy as one that was acceptable for
schools under its direction, yet the Higher Learning Commission (2014), never
specifically defined or discussed information literacy inclusion in any form in academia
or how information literacy courses should be developed for the classroom in colleges
under their direction. Instead, the Higher Learning Commission’s The Criteria for
Accreditation and Core Concepts stated that for institutions to be accredited they had to
engage their “students in collecting, analyzing, and communicating information; in
mastering modes of inquiry or creative work; and in developing skills adaptable to

116

changing environments” (Higher Learning Commission, 2014, 3B 3). In this way, they
avoided specific mention of information literacy or curriculum model application in the
universities and colleges they oversaw.
According to Mbabu (2007), information literacy courses that were developed
along the lines of the integrated or distributed model were generally upper-level
discipline specific courses. Often, subject-specific service-learning courses and cocurricular activities were developed with information literacy elements or concepts
seamlessly interwoven into them. This model clearly had a major advantage, in that,
information literacy concepts were integrated or embedded directly into disciplinary and
interdisciplinary contexts. At the sophomore, junior or even senior levels, when students
were more mature and had more experience in their discipline, they tended to ask many
more discipline-specific questions and would be ready to take an information literacy
course. At these academic levels, they were also required to devise more disciplinespecific search strategies, analysis and synthesis, than in the freshman year. Knowledge
creation was more apt to happen when information literacy was integrated or embedded
in subject-specific courses in which students worked on both interdisciplinary and
discipline-specific projects that required problem solving.
A New Curriculum for Information Literacy (Seeker & Coonan, 2011) model used
the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization’s vision rather than
the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education (2000) as a guide. It described the importance of
including some specific new learning elements and assessments developed by instructors
to be included into information literacy courses. It was suggested that instructors consider

117

implementing active and assessed curricula that contained significant elements, such as
active and reflective learning, authentic and peer assessment elements, and student
portfolios (Seeker & Coonan, 2011).
It was also suggested that instructors consider implementing flexible curricula,
which meant improving the student’s “overall school experiences and raising their
attainment and achievement” (Seeker & Coonan, 2011, p. 4). The means to do this was
through individualization and customization, thus meeting the student’s and stakeholders
needs at the local level (HM Inspectorate of Education, 2003). It was further suggested
that instructors also consider implementing transformative curricula in their classroom.
Transformative curricula was “grounded in a broad reading of 'information literacy'
which” saw “information literacy not as a set of competencies but as a fundamental
attribute of the discerning scholar, and as a crucial social and personal element in the
digital age” (Seeker & Coonan, 2011, p. 4). Table 2.5 simplified and explained the
different types of course structures created by instructors to teach information literacy.
Larger institutions were still using one-shots because they had large sections of
undergraduate students, limited time and staffing. Smaller institutions using one-shot
course structures often did not have an information literacy program and presented oneshot presentations in the classroom at the request of faculty at their institutions. The
modular unit was often used at institutions in the format of a tutorial that was often selfpaced. Students would often be asked to complete the tutorial that would be located on
the library page. These would then be scored or otherwise used as a preparation for
students before they came to visit the library for the first time and were presented with a
one-shot library experience. Other options that were available to instructors who had

118

created information literacy courses and programs were non-credit courses, one to three
credit hour courses or integrated or embedded courses. Embedded librarians were often
included in online course shells, where they would participate either as a personal
librarian for students in the class, or otherwise they were there to monitor student
discussion and interaction and answer questions that were course or subject–related.
“Embedded librarianship is a distinctive innovation that moves the librarians out
of libraries and creates a new model of library and information work. It
emphasizes the importance of forming a strong working relationship between the
librarian and a group or team of people who need the librarian’s information
expertise. As the relationship develops, the librarian’s knowledge and
understanding of the group’s work and objectives grow, which leads in turn to
greater alertness to the information and knowledge needs of the group. The
embedded librarian becomes just as engaged in the work of the team as any other
team member” (The Embedded Librarian, (n.d.), p.4)
Information literacy courses were also taught as part of the first-year experience or were
also implemented as training courses, service learning courses or ultimately as a minor
area of concentration. Information literacy minors were offered at institutions where
librarians believed that one information literacy course was not enough for their students
to become information literate. As a result they offered students three to six topical
information literacy courses that then made up of an information literacy minor. For
example, the information studies minor (18 credit hours) offered at the University of
Kentucky consist of six courses: three required courses and three electives (University of
Kentucky, 2016). Certificate programs in Information Literacy are also available at

119

institutions such as the Tarrant County College Libraries in Texas (Tarrant County
College Libraries, 2017). Table 2.5 outlines 12 of the information literacy course
structures and formats that are commonly found in institutions that offer online and
blended information literacy courses.

Information Literacy and the American Association of School Librarians’
Standards for the 21st Century Learner

In 2007, the American Association of School Librarians redefined and updated
the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education (2000) for implementation in the Standards for the 21st
Century Learner. In the American Association of School Libraries Standards for the 21st
Century Learner (2007), the student’s abilities to read and interpret information were
considered foundational skills that students needed to have prior to and alongside
developing their information literacy skills. Also important were independent inquiry,
which included individual responsibility, student disposition and self-assessment,
technology skill development and ethical behavior as described in Table 2.6. All were
considered to be vital skills that needed to be taught in information literacy.
The American Association of School Librarian’s Standards for the 21st Century
Learner (2007) had four strands, four standards and ten common beliefs. The four strands
were: skills, disposition in action, responsibilities and self-assessment strategies. The
skills were those key abilities that were needed for learning, understanding and mastering
subject knowledge. The dispositions in action were those ongoing beliefs and attitudes
that the student had developed that had to be used to guide their thinking and intellectual
behavior and that were measured through the actions they took in every situation they
were exposed to. The responsibilities were those common behaviors that were used by
students when they were required to participate in research, investigation, and problem
solving. The self-assessment strategies were reflections of the student’s own learning and
were effective in determining learning of the first three strands.

The four standards were focused on teachers and librarians developing the
student’s inquiry, critical thinking, and knowledge development skills and on teaching
them to draw conclusions, create and apply new information, share their knowledge and
interact proactively, thereby having the ability to pursue their own aesthetic and personal
growth within the society. The foundation of The American Association of School
Librarian’s Standards for the 21st Century Learner (2007) standards were viewed as ten
common beliefs:


Source: The American Association of School Librarian’s Standards for the 21st Century
Learner (2007). Retrieved from http://www.ala.org/aasl/standards/learning
The American Association of School Librarians’ Standards for the 21st Century
Learner (2007) defined information literacy as a “metaliteracy” which included digital,
visual, textual and technological literacies included in the one term. Metaliteracy was
defined by Mackey & Jacobson (2011) as an overarching framework that integrated
emerging technologies and a multitude of new literacy types. Metaliteracy types such as
visual literacy, digital literacy, computer literacy were described to be constructs that
supported the acquisition, production and sharing of knowledge in collaborative
communities. Transliteracy in turn, was defined as “the ability to read, write and interact
across a range of platforms, tools and media,” unifying “competing approaches to
literacy” and is used “as an inclusive concept” which “bridges and connects modalities,”
which are indicative of “a broader need to converge multiple methodologies, including
analog and digital formats” (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011, p. 69). It also emphasized the
necessity for students to learn how to work in teams, gather information, synthesize,
create new information and share it appropriately, so that the new ideas gathered can be
used to develop and create new, cutting-edge projects.
The creation of the American Association of School Librarians’ Standards for the
21st Century Learner (2007) and the many changes in how technology was being used in
the library setting fueled the conversation between college librarians about updating the
123

Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education (2000), revising them by adding new information literacy
theory and concepts, and taking them beyond the rules stage via simplification so that
they can be used by everyone (Farmer, 2013; Schroeder & Cahoy, 2010).

Association of College and Research Libraries: Information Competency Standards
Review Taskforce

In 2012, the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards Review Taskforce was given the charge to review the Association
of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for
Higher Education (2000). They recommended that the Standards be extensively revised
and improved due to significant “changes in technology, scholarly communication and
the information life cycle” which had “contributed to the changing face of information
literacy in higher education” (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2012, p. 2).
The taskforce recommended that the Association of College and Research
Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) be
simplified and rendered jargon-free, so that non-librarians could easily use them. Further
recommendations from the committee were that the Standards (2000) revisions recognize
the import of metaliteracy and transliteracy in information literacy.
The need to include affective and cognitive student learning outcomes when
designing information literacy courses was considered to be important. The committee
recommended that the student’s role as a content creator and curator be considered when
designing information literacy courses. Finally, it recommended that the Standards (2000)
124

be revised to align with the American Association of School Librarians’ Standards for
the 21st Century learner (2007) which was revised in 2007. The Association of College
and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education provided an updated view of information literacy framed in the format of
American Association of School Librarians’ “Learning Standards” (Association of
College and Research Libraries, 2012, p. 6).

The 2016 Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education

The Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education was filed by the
Association of College and Research Libraries Board on February 2, 2015 and adopted
alongside the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000). In the introduction it was stated
that even though academic libraries had implemented the Association of College and
Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education
(2000) in the outcomes of their information literacy programs, the new Framework
(2016) was created because of a “rapidly changing higher education environment, along
with the dynamic and often uncertain information ecosystem in which all of us work and
live” (Framework for Higher Education, 2015, Para. 1).
The Framework (2016) was developed because students had a greater role to play
in the creation of information and in changing the dynamics of information, while
“teaching faculty” had “a greater responsibility in designing curricula and assignments
that foster enhanced engagement with the core ideas about information and scholarship
within their disciplines” (Framework for Higher Education, 2015, Para. 1). The
125

Framework (2016) was “based on a cluster of interconnected core concepts” (Para. 2) that
could be very flexible when implemented in a program. They also went further than a
mere set of outcomes in organizing the understanding of information, research and ideas
as a “coherent whole” (Para. 2) providing “threshold concepts” (Para. 2) or passageways
of thinking and understanding that these could be applied within the disciplines.
There are five threshold concepts that are emphasized in the Framework. The
threshold concepts are described as follows:
Transformative: causes a shift in perspective,
Irreversible: once learned it cannot be unlearned,
Integrative: unifies facts, lessons and concepts,
Bounded: defines the boundaries of a particular discipline, and
Troublesome: Counter-intuitive (Mackey & Jacobsen, 2011).
Using the threshold concepts in teaching information literacy are about
overcoming student struggles or dealing with troublesome knowledge. For example,
scaffolding occurs so that when students have difficulty understanding how to cite
sources, then they can work through specially developed tutorials that aid them in
understanding authority. Additionally, defining an in-text citation, why we cite sources,
how it is cited, or how to create a reference list using American Psychological
Association (APA) and the ethics behind these steps should be taught. The threshold
concepts are concerned with how instructors help their students overcome troublesome
barriers to their learning, and find new ways of thinking and practicing what they are
learning so that they can overcome their biggest struggles. Starting out, the instructor
works to transform the student’s perceptive in relation to “Authority is Constructed and
Contextual.” Once the student learns and understands how to cite and why we cite and
how “Authority” is Constructed and Contextual”, then there is a transformation because

126

they now have understood what was originally hard to grasp. Going beyond that in
application, their learning is irreversible. The student can then integrate their learning
into other situations and they can also become aware of the boundaries across curricula.
For example, an instructor can teach Modern Language Association (MLA) style to a
student compared to APA style, and explain that MLA is commonly practiced as a
citation style in the discipline of English Literature while APA is commonly used to cite
sources in Psychology and Business disciplines. This is bounded knowledge because the
student is able to see that there are boundaries between disciplines and what these
boundaries are, and how the disciplines are different. There are six frames that can be
used to help students better understand information literacy concepts in the classroom:







Authority is constructed and contextual (authority is defined, used, understood,
recognized, acknowledged and connected with other authorities)
Information creation is a process (an information format is created, revised,
disseminated, shared and reorganized)
Information has value (information is understood as a commodity along with its
social and legal influences)
Research is inquiry (understanding the research process, information gaps and
questions to ask relating to different kinds of research)
Scholarship is conversation (e.g. understanding how to read a scholarly article)
Searching is a strategic exploration (using tools to find scholarly/ peer-reviewed
sources and developing Boolean terms for finding research articles).
Note: Adapted from Association of College and Research Libraries Framework
for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016).
After 12 years of an outdated application of the Association of College and

Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards (2000) to student
learning in academic institutions, the ACRL Board of Directors authorized the revision of
the Standards. A Taskforce was created “charged with drafting a new information literacy
Framework” in June 2012 (Burgess, 2015) and it began its work in March 2013. The

127

Framework (2015) underwent consistent revision with the aid of the ACRL membership,
as three drafts were made public and addressed through online forums and meetings at
the American Library Association Conferences. The Association of College and Research
Libraries Board filed the final draft of the Framework on February 2, 2015. Following
this final draft release, “there was the effort toward transparency” that “included many
opportunities for input that will help the Framework earn a strong measure of democratic
consent and broad participation” (Beilin, 2015, Para.1) Further revisions of the
Framework (2015) led to its adoption by the Association of College and Research
Libraries Board on January 11, 2016.
After the adoption of the new Framework (2016), the Association of College and
Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards (2000) was rescinded on
June 25, 2016. As the ACRL Insider (2016) stated “the ACRL Board of Directors voted
to rescind the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education”.
It is important to acknowledge the groundbreaking work embodied in the
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, approved
by the Board in 2000, in moving the profession forward. These Standards were
co-developed with and subsequently endorsed by the American Association for
Higher Education and the Council for Independent Colleges.
ACRL recognizes the tremendous contributions of the Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education and the transformational work of
many ACRL members working with them. Those Standards paved the way for
information literacy to become common language in many general education
requirements and informed many regional and subject-oriented accreditation
bodies. The Board will continue to seek input from the profession as the
process moves forward (The ACRL Insider, June 25, 2016).
Additional documents relating to the rescinding of the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000) in 2016 can be found in Appendix Q.

128

The revised and newly adopted Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) will likely have a
resounding and far-reaching impact on information literacy curricula and program
development across the United States in the future. More specifically, librarians may
need to develop new curricula and course content to respond these changes.

Information Literacy and Higher Education

According to Starkey (2010), information literacy became essential to higher
education in the 1990s after “the technology boom forced the reform of university
general education programs” (p. 38). As a result of the need to implement information
literacy in the college setting, information literacy was transformed from a skills-based
pedagogy (bibliographic instruction) into a concept-based pedagogy (Information
Literacy). This transformation “encouraged learning across the curriculum,” taught
critical thinking skills, “promoted the ethical use of information,” and “an appreciation
for the nature of information itself and its role in lifelong learning” (Franklin, 2013, p.
12).
Cooper (2012) suggested that educators in higher education begin to realize that
teaching information literacy to students was the key to developing lifelong learners in
academia that it was considered to be central to the mission of higher education
institutions. It soon became an important and timely topic that was explored by
researchers (Breivik, 2000; Head, 2008; Gross & Latham, 2009), thereby expanding
academic librarians’ exposure to information literacy in the Education and the library
science literatures. Oakleaf (2006) pointed out that “academic libraries form the
129

cornerstone” (p. 14) of information literacy instruction. This was because information
literacy focused on information problems. Academic librarians understood the need to
hone student information literacy skills that allowed them to become better independent
learners, researchers and problem-solvers who knew how to find, use, manipulate,
repackage and create new information.
Information Literacy and Higher Education
Veach’s (2012) doctoral research was centered on rhetoric and composition,
seeing information literacy from the perspective of an English teacher and not a library
professional. Veach (2012) believed that information literacy was a shared goal of the
English teaching professional and the librarian and attempted to understand how failed
engagement with students during information literacy sessions could be improved. The
study used a mixed-methods approach, with surveys, case study interviews and textual
analysis to answer questions focusing on how information literacy was taught using
websites, what teaching methods were employed, what successes were occurring in the
classroom and what English composition teachers could learn from information literacy
assessment procedures.
Veach (2012) examined 30 English department websites and conducted a 31question survey with librarians and English composition faculty teaching information
literacy classes at institutions across the United States. Eighty English faculty and 217
librarians completed surveys, with a total of 297 responses. The librarian responses came
from community colleges (16%), small colleges that had under 1500 students (21%),
medium-sized colleges (26%), large colleges over 4000 students (four percent), mediumsized universities up to 15,000 students (19%), and large universities (11%) and two

130

percent of the librarians not fitting into any of the categories. The writing instructors were
from community colleges (14%), small colleges (16%), medium-sized colleges (15%),
large colleges (six percent), medium-sized universities (24%), and large universities
(21%), with four percent of faculty selecting “other.” When considering the librarians,
there were administrators (21%), instruction or reference librarians (71%), technical
services librarians (two percent), five percent choosing “other,” with 86% of the
librarians having taught information literacy classes (Veach, 2012, p. 76-77) who had
participated in the study.
Veach’s study (2012) found that between 79% and 91% of the librarians
surveyed, believed that each of the information literacy standards should be taught in
composition classes. Seventy percent of respondents said that they taught information
literacy to their students during at least one class period during a semester. When taking
into consideration the length of class time spent on teaching information literacy classes
and presentations, 12% of respondents said that they had less than one hour to give a
presentation, 11% had two hours and only six percent had three or more class hours to
spend on presentations to students at any one time. Twenty percent of survey respondents
teaching English classes said that they often were reinforcing or adding new information
to the librarian’s presentation, but when they did, they were not covering the different
Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education (2000). According to Veach (2012)’s survey, 85% of
writing instructors and 46% of librarians reported that the writing instructor “always”
stayed in the classroom during a librarian’s presentation. It was interesting to note the
difference in response, which was almost double on the part of writing instructors when

131

compared with librarians. This response was very telling, since it was common for
writing teachers to leave librarians to their presentations without hearing the presentation
themselves or being present to continue to emphasize the important concepts dealt with
by librarians. As a result, students often did not take librarian presentations seriously
because of the attitudes of writing teachers at their institutions to the librarian’s
presentations.
Veach (2012) stated that information literacy programs became part of college
general education curriculums because they were often offered as single courses
associated with the library and not a specific subject area. “Larger schools could afford
more institutional and administrative support for cross-curricular programs like
Information Literacy” (p. 108) and could staff these programs, while smaller colleges
with limited budgets could not. Veach (2012) concluded that educators and librarians
teaching information literacy were often burdened with the outcome that their critical
thinking and writing classes would immediately turn students who were not good writers
into “accomplished college writers” (p.108). According to the survey, one-third of
respondents indicated affirmatively “that composition classes” were being asked to bear
the entire burden of information literacy instruction in most institutions, since “not only
were “composition instructors expected to turn out accomplished college-level writers,
but it seemed that they” were “also held responsible for” producing “future college-level
researchers” (Veach, 2012, p.108). This was problematic for both librarians and English
faculty because most information literacy classes were not developed as classes that
taught students basic writing skills. Rather, these classes taught students critical thinking
skills, such as how to develop their computer literacy skills, handle the complexities

132

surrounding citing sources, combat plagiarism and apply writing styles to their formal
written papers. Thus, when attempting to address the administrator’s stance regarding
information literacy, as well as teaching students writing skills, and providing them with
the technical format knowledge was burdensome. Students often did not get these skills
from English Composition classes, so this request was extremely problematic (Emmons
& Martin, 2002).
College students entering information literacy classes tended to have very
different experiences with the library and searching for online resources, using the
databases or the catalog and also with writing papers and understanding writing styles. It
would take more than one credit-bearing class in information literacy to change the
lowest performing students into good researchers and writers overnight. However, it also
must be remembered that information literacy classes should not be seen as ‘catch-all’
classes, since it is not the information literacy instructor’s place to teach English
Composition in the information literacy class, although it is appropriate to coach students
on writing style formats, citing, annotated bibliographies and creating reference lists, that
are in-keeping with the day-to-day library instruction given to students at the library
reference desk.
Franklin (2013) also encouraged librarians and faculty in the disciplines to
collaborate and work together to develop learning outcomes for information literacy
courses, even when information literacy classes were limited. Faculty members in the
disciplines are “the developers of curriculum in higher education” (p. 13).
Franklin (2013) explored and described how inter-professional factors impacted
faculty/librarian collaboration, the collaborative learning and dialogue occurring between

133

faculty and librarian collaborators, and faculty and librarians’ perceptions (in terms of
these impacts) of their collaboration when working with students. Franklin (2013)
conducted a mixed- methods study using semi-structured interviews and an online
questionnaire. Additionally, a purposive, criterion-based sample of 18 librarians who met
the following three criteria was chosen for the study. The three criteria were as follows:
(1) the librarians had to be working at public or private two-year or four-year accredited
schools (2) they had to have collaborated with a faculty member for at least one full
academic quarter or semester 2006-2011 to integrate information literacy into a course,
academic program, or discipline at a two-year or four-year accredited higher education
institution in California and (3) they had to recommend to the researcher a faculty
member with whom they had collaborated to participate in the study.
Seventeen faculty members who had collaborated with librarians were
interviewed and asked to complete the online questionnaire. Fifty-one percent of the
faculty and librarians participating in the study had taught for over 20 years in a college
or university setting and 41% of the faculty participants were tenured. A collaborative
profile of participants was created in survey format. Franklin (2013) found that 94% of
the librarian participants stated that faculty and librarians were equally responsible for
assessing student information literacy skills, whereas only 65% of the faculty was in
agreement regarding this. For collaboration between librarians and faculty, the most
common activities according to Franklin’s (2013) study were co-teaching classes and copresenting at conferences. In classroom collaboration between faculty and librarians,
Franklin (2013) also found that faculty and librarians disagreed most regarding how
much responsibility librarians had when integrating information literacy into the

134

curriculum. Franklin's (2013) survey found that 48% of the participants, believed that
librarian/faculty collaboration was vital, if librarians were to get information literacy
integrated into the curriculum. Collaboration was key if information literacy was to be
integrated into discipline-related courses. Findings suggested that collaboration and
integration was less important to faculty, since only 45% of the faculty were in agreement
that information literacy should be taught at all.
The contention that faculty believed that both class assessment and course
integration, were tasks that fell into the faculty as classroom teacher realm, and not into
that of the librarian-instructor realm, was supported by Franklin (2013). Franklin (2013)
stated that “faculty members in this study were not completely comfortable with
involving librarians in the assessment process, and several saw the assessment of student
work as the faculty member’s domain and responsibility” (Franklin, 2012, p.192). This
was because historically, librarians presented one-shot sessions in discipline specific
courses, on faculty request. Librarians wanted to move beyond the limitations of the oneshot library instruction presentation, and start to either develop single information literacy
courses or attempt to integrate information literacy components into discipline specific
courses, which could not be done without librarian/faculty collaboration regarding how
the latter would be done in a specific course. As a result, those teaching in specific
disciplines wanted to retain their control over task development and assessment processes
within their course. These instructors had a difficult time allowing librarians to
implement standardized or homegrown information literacy tests that measured student
information literacy skills or to include information literacy topics and assignments

135

requiring students to apply library-related tools or models in their courses through the
process of integration.
Information Literacy and Assessment in Higher Education
Saunders’ (2010) qualitative multiple case study provided an accreditation
overview which included an in-depth history of the six educational accrediting agencies
that were responsible for regulating institutions of higher education in the United States
and further described all accreditation stakeholders and how the accreditation process
worked for institutions. Saunders’ (2010) accreditation organization was responsible to
the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (2015), which was also the leading
accrediting organization when it came to the application of information literacy programs
at institutions. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education (2015) was the only
accreditation organization that provided for “the continued development of information
literacy as a student learning outcome” (p. 32) at the institutions in its jurisdiction by
creating the most detailed and comprehensive sets of standards regarding information
literacy outcomes that could be used by libraries for application. These standards
provided librarians with guidelines that explained how and why information literacy
programs should be implemented in their institutions.
The population examined during Saunders’ (2010) study was institutions
accredited by the Middle States Commission, with the exclusion of community colleges,
specialist and online institutions. The case study was conducted in three phases with each
having its own methodology. In the first phase, a pre-test was conducted using documents
drawn from institutions outside the United States, from its territories and also from selfcontained colleges and universities that did not have branch campuses not included in the

136

final phase. A framework of categories and preselected keywords were developed for
phases two and three. Saunders (2010) used content analysis to ascertain from
accreditation documents how information literacy was discussed, implemented and
assessed and what Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) were used in their programs,
discerning common patterns relating to information literacy. In the second phase, 279
college and university accreditation documents were examined to understand how
information literacy was mentioned, defined, what outcomes were used, how programs
were developed and assessed and to look for similarities and differences and understand
information leadership issues.
The researcher applied the framework created for phase two, inductive category
application and also tallied the preselected keywords in the documents studied using
qualitative content analysis. Phase two was followed by phase three that focused on four
institutions who would undergo in-depth analysis in the form of qualitative interviews.
The four institutions chosen had developed information literacy programs and that had
also developed a national reputation for information literacy.
Saunders (2010) found that information literacy had been included in the mission
statements of 97 institutions’ self-study reports. There was evidence from accreditation
reports that information literacy was being integrated in the curriculum and into general
education programs (59% of colleges in the sample). However, there was also evidence
that these were not as strongly supported in terms of outcomes at those institutions since
course outcomes were often very broad and overlapped with information literacy
outcomes suggested by the Middle States Commission documents. According to

137

Saunders (2010) self-report analysis, 63% of colleges and universities in the Middle
States Commission states provided their students with information literacy instruction in
course format, with only 20% of those courses being for-credit courses taught by
librarians.
Saunders (2010) also found that many institutions were still in the early stages of
information literacy outcomes implementation and that the self-studies examined
suggested that information literacy implementation was growing in Middle States
Commission institutions, between 1999 and 2009. Information literacy was only one of
many 21st century skills required by student graduates entering the workforce, but
instruction librarians had to find a way to make it a priority in institutions that was
important for students to acquire amongst all the competing demands on time, resources
and educational practices that were identified as vital in the college and university setting.
The Middle States Commission required information literacy to be addressed at all levels
of the college curriculum however it was believed that this was not happening when
information literacy was taught as a one-shot presentation. Saunders (2010) found that
the many of the institutions were not making attempts to develop information literacy
courses that were created using coordinated and systematic best practices approaches and
thus courses were often created that did not include goals and outcomes that had been set
and could then be effectively assessed.
Saunders (2010) also found that the institutional development, engagement and
assessment of information literacy courses were very uneven among Middle States
Commission institutions. Overall “the current state of information literacy in the
institutions examined” in the study stood “in stark contrast to the emphasis that

138

stakeholders” had placed “on the concept…This inability to achieve integrated
information literacy” suggested “a vacuum of leadership for information literacy in these
institutions” (Saunders, 2010, p. 285-6).
According to Conner (2012), information literacy skills assessment in higher
education began in the 1980s, but continued to grow as a result of social pressures on the
colleges and universities that had developed information literacy programs to graduate
undergraduate and graduate students that were information literate. Over the years, many
information literacy skills assessment instruments were developed and standardized and
utilized as pre and post-tests or as rubrics in information literacy courses. To date, there
were only a handful of dissertations that dealt specifically with information literacy
instrument and rubric creation, and reliability and validity testing during development.
In one such study, Critchfield (2005) created the Information Literacy Indicator to
assess the information literacy skills of college freshmen. Critchfield’s (2005) study was
conducted by developing and then administering an information literacy test to a group of
78 freshmen and then to a second group of 81 freshmen at Warner Southern College in
Florida, with the primary goal of developing a reliable information literacy instrument..
The Information Literacy Indicator consisted of closed-ended Likert-scale items, with
questions focused on the application of the five Association of College and Research
Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) in the
educational setting. During the development of the Information Literacy Indicator, 14
information literacy specialists who tested this assessment’s validity and reliability were
interviewed; then the assessment was given to the 81 college freshmen. Following these
protocols, the Information Literacy Indicator was revised and 16 items were removed

139

from the original 145 assessments. The Information Literacy Indicator was deemed to be
a reliable instrument that could indicate information literacy levels in students across the
Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education (2000).
Related to information literacy assessment instrument development, Oakleaf’s
(2006) information literacy assessment study dealt with analytical rubrics. Five groups of
librarians, English professors and outside raters from American Research Libraries
universities were used to rate the reliability and validity of the rubric and inter-rater
reliability testing was also done. Ratings from five raters with the highest validity ranks
were then used to predict students’ performance in the study. The rubric that was
designed for use by students to evaluate a website had four criteria, which were defined
as: determining authority terminology use, citing examples of indicators of authority;
identifying indicators in example website and making decisions about the website’s use.
Oakleaf (2006) found that when using rubrics, students were empowered to understand
how scoring worked and how their assignments were evaluated. Students could then
assess themselves using information literacy rubrics work collaboratively with their peers
using these rubrics along with their scoring rubrics, and assess and identify their own
learning development in the process.
At present, three dominant information literacy instruments are currently in use in
colleges and universities across the United States as pre- and post-information literacy
course assessment tests. These include: James Madison University’s Information Literacy
Test (ILT), Kent State University’s Standardized Assessment of Information Literacy
Skills (Project SAILS), and the Educational Testing Service’s iSkills test. However, the

140

researcher discovered that the cost-prohibitive nature of these instruments prevented
many smaller colleges and universities from applying them in their information literacy
programs as pre- and post-tests, a fact which encouraged the proliferation of nonstandardized instruments that were developed as in-house information literacy assessment
tests. In-house information literacy rubric development was also common in college and
university information literacy programs.
Alongside the formal assessment tools that were applied in information literacy as
discussed by Oakleaf (2006) and Critchfield (2005), there was also “authentic
assessment” which was “focused on” the “practical application of tasks in real-world
settings” as a “direct measure of” the student’s “acquired knowledge and tasks”
(Hoffman & LeBonte, 2012, p. 71), as regularly utilized by information literacy
instructors in the classroom setting. According to Oakleaf (2006) authentic assessment
happens when students gain the opportunity to perform self-assessments of their
information literacy skills, through hands-on approaches in the classroom setting and
through project work, portfolio creation tasks which were “multilayered” views of
“student performance, experience and reflections” and rubric self-assessment tools
(Hoffman & LeBonte, 2012, p. 71). Portfolio assessment and self-assessment rubrics
were viewed by information literacy instructors as “valid and reliable” tools “to assess
information literacy” (Hoffman & LeBonte, 2012, p.72). This helped instructors to assess
the student’s information literacy levels.
Conner’s (2012) study was conducted at a private Appalachian college with nontraditional students aged 25 and older that were studying at bachelors, masters and
doctoral levels. There were 303 participants, 61 doctoral students, 194 master’s degree

141

students and 48 bachelor’s degree students. Conner (2012) investigated whether or not
there were significant differences between self-directed learning and information literacy
skills. Conner (2012) used demographical information and two tests, the Personal
Responsibility Orientation in Self-Directed Learning Scale (PRO-SDLS), and
Information Literacy Test (ILT), to do an analysis and make a determination regarding
the interplay between significant factors. Conner (2012) found there to be no significant
difference between all the group scores on the Self-Directed Learning Scale, suggesting
that self-directed learning based on test scores did not change based on educational
attainment.
Conner (2012)’s initial hypothesis was that as students became more information
literate they also became more self-directed in their learning. Instead, Conner (2012)’s
finding in the study was that as students became more information literate, they actually
became less self-directed. Conner (2012) suggested that possible explanations for these
findings had to do with how the concepts were understood and measured in the study e.g.
there were low test reliability scores, unequal participant groups and unclear questions
and answers to questions posed during the study. As a result, Conner (2012), stated in
relation to study findings, that information literacy had to be clearly defined at the
institutional and program levels in order “to ensure” that “appropriate assignments and
materials were provided to the students,” since “by creating a clear definition, students
could understand the specific goals and objectives” of the course “while faculty” could
then “create practical assignments and discussions that” increased “both skills and
preferences” (Conner, 2012, p.93). Conner (2012) suggested that if there was a
disconnect between the institutional definition of information literacy, the students’

142

perception of it, and the librarians focus of instruction, then a confusing situation would
be created for the students and they would struggle with information concepts and
application in their course. Instead, Conner (2012) suggested that the institutional
definition of information literacy had to relate and be connected to how it was taught at
the college and university; and only then students’ perceptions of information literacy
courses would be more positive, because they would be much more successful.

Information Literacy and the University Library

The college or university library stakeholder’s perceptions have always had an
effect on the academic librarian (Hoffman & LeBonte, 2012), therefore librarians have
attempted to improve library services, resources offerings, programming and instruction
to these stakeholders as best they could at their locations. Faculty and administrator
perceptions, in particular, pertaining to librarians have often directly affected their
academic status, their ability or inability to collaborate with specific academic
departments or with administration, their involvement with faculty committees and the
curriculum. As Ivey (1994) points out, it was the lack of librarian communication with
faculty that had often led to misconceptions regarding their role in their own departments
and in academia. There was often unwillingness on the part of faculty, to collaborate with
them as a direct result. Faculty-administrator perceptions also affected the librarian’s
ability to transition from teaching one-shot information literacy classes to implementing
an information literacy course at their Campuses or integrating information literacy into
their university curriculum. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2013) defined the
stakeholder as “one who has a stake in an enterprise” and “one who is involved in or
143

affected by a course of action.” In the case of the college or university library, the library
stakeholders that had the most to lose or gain when the library integrated a credit-bearing
information literacy course into the curriculum, were students, faculty, staff, and
administration at the said institution.
Seamans (2001) conducted a mixed-methods study with participants from a
section of a freshman English class at Virginia Tech. Five questions were posed that
focused on how students acquired, used, made sense of, utilized, were exposed to and
evaluated information. The study was divided into three phases of inquiry that included a
survey, electronic dialogues with students and in-depth interviews with eight students.
Case study methods were used in the study. Seamans (2001) found when describing
overarching themes in her study that freshman at Virginia Tech stated that they did not
need information other than what faculty requested they find for their assignments. These
students deemed themselves capable of finding any other information that they might
need in their personal lives by using Internet search engines. They appeared to have very
excellent computer skills, but “all reported little use of indexes and databases and said
they found them difficult to use” (p.62). When examining information evaluation, a large
number of the freshmen questioned, did not evaluate sources, but those who did were
found to be “relatively sophisticated in the approaches they took” (p. 62). Seaman’s’
(2001) findings were backed up in the literature by Emmons & Martin (2002) who also
found that “students used the Internet to do research…they saw little need for tools the
library could offer…students came to the campus highly computer literate, not realizing
that they were information illiterate” (Emmons & Martin, 2002, p. 545).

144

Stern (2002) conducted a case study at Ferris State University and Capella University
to ascertain the digital information literacy competencies of incoming freshman students.
During the study, 1,184 students or 50% of the student populations at both schools were
given a quantitative multiple-choice survey to collect data about student Internet use
patterns that informed librarians at both universities about student skill needs and
information literacy policy and practice that could be applied by course designers to
address the needs of these incoming students. The survey that was conducted was focused
around four areas: Internet usage patterns, previous experience and information literacy
competency levels, the ability to do keyword searching on the Internet and the ability to
determine website reliability. When analyzing incoming student needs, Stern (2002)
found that the incoming freshmen surveyed required systematic basic digital information
literacy instruction. However, although the students had a diverse range of Internet use
patterns, and had different information literacy skill levels, there were those too who had
very limited Internet searching skills. This was because they had not used the Internet as
much as their peers had done in high school for projects or homework assignments. Stern
(2002) found that even though students owned a computer that did not mean that they
were digitally literate. When considering higher levels of digital literacy or critical
thinking, the incoming students were largely found to be information illiterate (Emmons
& Martin, 2002). Stern (2002) also found that incoming students more specifically
needed instruction on how to do academic research.
Moore (2005) conducted a quantitative study with a random group of 411 diverse
students (302 female and 109 male students), to ascertain whether there was a significant
difference in the successful completion of online courses between students who had

145

completed an information literacy course and those who did not; and whether or not
gender and ethnicity made a difference in online course completion. Moore (2005) also
wanted to ascertain whether information literacy course completers performed better and
had higher success rates in subsequent and multiple online courses than did the students
who did not complete an information literacy course. During the study, students were
organized into experimental and control groups. Correlations were sought between the
successful completion of an information literacy course and the successful completion an
online course while controlling for ethnicity, multiple course enrollments and gender.
Moore (2005) found that student success rates were almost identical across control and
experimental groups, with one third of the male students passing the information literacy
course, also being successful in the online course, while only half of the males who did
not pass information literacy course passed the online course. The females were found to
be 22% more likely to pass the online course than the males. Black, Asian and Hispanic
students were found to have lower success rates in the information literacy course and
also in passing the online courses, when compared with White students at the college.
When considering multiple online courses, information literacy course completers who
enrolled in seven or more courses were found to have higher success rates at passing
multiple classes than those who had not taken an information literacy course.
Cosantino (2003) conducted a mixed-methods study with interviews and surveys
designed by eight information experts to determine the extent to which faculty,
administrators and students at a private university perceived that learning information
literacy skills was important. Four hundred and eight undergraduate students and 71
faculty members participated in the study on the private university’s campus.

146

Cosantino (2003) found that students primarily used the Internet to do their research,
and did not use the library to find resources for their written papers. These students
were found to have poor online searching skills, due to the fact that the faculty at the
private college did not encourage students to use references in their papers and use
the library to find them. Cosantino (2003) found that there was a dire need for
faculty-librarian collaboration at the college, so that the faculty would be willing to
direct their students to the library to find resources and use the library online
databases when they had to conduct assignment research. The results of the study
indicated that both students and faculty believed that information literacy skills were
vital and that it was a necessity for them to be able to distinguish between the web
resources and the online library databases. However, faculty wrongly assumed that
students had learned these skills from librarians during library instruction. Students
stated that these skills were self-taught and not learned from any form of library
instruction. Ultimately, because faculty members assumed that students already had
information literacy skills and were already able to use their skills in the classroom
setting, faculty deemed it unnecessary to include information literacy instruction in
their courses.
Dhanesar (2006) conducted a mixed-methods study at an urban minority-based
Community College where English Department faculty, librarians and students were
interviewed about the effects of librarian-faculty collaboration to improve student
information literacy skills (Hoffman & LeBonte, 2012; Mackey & Jacobson, 2006). The
students were divided into control and treatment groups and given an information literacy
pretest. There were 86 students in the control group, 36 males and 50 females, with 35 of

147

the students enrolled for their first semester at the Community College. There were 59
students in the treatment group, 24 male and 35 female students, with 35 of the students
enrolled for the first time at the Community College. The students in the treatment group
received four weeks of information literacy, meeting librarians for instruction twice a
week during that period of time. The control group received only one hour of information
literacy. Dhanesar (2006) found that there was low librarian-faculty collaboration at the
community college, with the faculty not comfortable at all with using the library
databases and resources. The faculty did not see information literacy as a course that
should be integrated into the curriculum at their college, and instead they saw their
students’ interaction with information literacy as merely a one-time experience, when
they decided to bring their students to the library prior to their having to do an assignment
or write a paper. It was found that those students in the information literacy treatment
group were able to improve their information literacy skills, while those in the control
group had information literacy skills that were sorely lacking.
McAdoo (2008) had similar findings to those of Dhanesar (2006), when a case
study at the University of Pennsylvania was conducted to explore faculty perceptions of
information literacy and assess aspects of the university’s existing information literacy
program that was offered as part of the general education program. Although the faculty
at the university was initially invited via email to participate in a survey that was
developed for the study, only 38% of the faculty or 166 participants completed the
survey. McAdoo (2008) found that the university faculty had a very good understanding
of the general education requirements that students had to complete at their university,
which included information literacy course offerings. Despite that, they appeared to have

148

a mixed awareness and a general lack of knowledge and understanding of what
information literacy was and why information literacy had to be taught to all students
regardless of their discipline. There was agreement that information literacy impacted
students, and there were several faculty members who believed that they should be
teaching information literacy to their students. However, because the majority of the
faculty lacked an understanding of information literacy, everyone was not willing to
support the information literacy courses and as a result, it had not yet been fully
integrated into the university curriculum.
In studies completed prior to McAdoo (2008), Owusu-Ansah (2004) and Ivey
(1994) found that university and college faculty often did not support academic librarians
teaching information literacy on their campuses, because many did not view librarians as
academics capable of teaching information literacy to their students even when they had
academic rank. Rather, they viewed them as mere library professionals who performed
non-academic tasks. Ivey (2004) suggested that as a result of these faculty perceptions, it
was deemed necessary for librarians to aggressively market their skills and the library’s
teaching and research mission to the college faculty and continue to strive for more
university service opportunities, and participation on faculty committees, more
specifically those that dealt with curriculum issues.
When comparing the findings of the McAdoo (2008), Dhanesar (2006) and
Constantino (2003) studies, it was clear that librarians had to work tirelessly when
seeking to form collaborative relationships with their faculties in order to partner with
faculty members to utilize the library’s physical and online resources (Emmons &
Martin; Hoffman & LeBonte, 2012; Mackey & Jacobson, 2005). It was also clear that if

149

librarians were unable to form successful faculty-librarian partnerships that were
supportive of and allowed for collaborative work to develop credit-bearing information
literacy courses that could be fully integrated into the college or university curriculum,
then it was extremely difficult to develop information literacy courses that were
sanctioned by the administration and the faculty. It was therefore not be surprising to find
that information literacy one-shots were still in existence at these libraries and that there
were very limited or non-existent information literacy course opportunities available to
students.
Franklin (2013) conducted a study using questionnaires and semi-structured
interviews with faculty and librarians, to ascertain how collaborative learning and
professional dialogue impacted the collaboration between faculty members and librarians
in the context of integrating information literacy into teaching and learning.
Franklin (2013) found that formal and informal social networking on campus was
critical to the collaboration between faculty and librarians as there was indeed value in
establishing collaboration between colleagues. However, there were also specific factors
that either facilitated or hindered colleague collaboration that needed to be considered in
any collaborative situation. These factors included organizational factors such as team
resources, team limitations, time constraints and organizational and departmental
structures that often got in-between colleague interactions or prevented them from
happening. There were also systemic factors such as social, cultural, socioeconomic
factors and interactional factors such as trust, distrust and willingness to interact that also
played a part in how collaborations worked or did not work out. Franklin (2013) also
found that collaboration was very important when the library was attempting to put

150

information literacy structures into place at colleges and universities and that it was vital
to collaborate with faculty and encourage them to bring or direct students to library to use
library resources (DaCosta, 2010; Jacobson, 2001; Mackey & Jacobson, 2005). The
information literacy librarian’s role at the university was to ensure that information
literacy was integrated into the curriculum, and then taught and assessed. It was often
also necessary for librarians to gain a good understanding of curricular matters, how
faculty built curriculum and how faculty at that specific college worked with department
heads and administrators to successfully put curriculum through academic councils and
structures. It was also vital that information literacy librarians found time to educate the
faculty who were collaborating with, about their role of supporting the information
literacy program by preparing their students for librarian interaction and expressing to
them that the library was connected to the student learning process and could aid and
support them in many ways, such as with improving their online search and writing style
skills.
Chai’s (2006) dissertation studied Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) and
Masters of Science in Nursing (MSN) students taking classes the University of California
Dominquez Hills campus. Initially, a listserv was setup at the university that included 455
BSN and 278 MSN students, but there was no way for the researcher to ascertain which
students had taken face-to-face and which students had taken online classes. Students
participated in two activities through the listserv: Learning Styles Inventory and a
Zoomerang Survey with four sections: demographics information, computer and
information literacy, and student satisfaction and student perception of learning questions
which was a combination of open-ended and rated questions. The researcher was unable

151

to correlate and analyze the two surveys. After rethinking, the study additional elements
were added to the survey to link them. Three attempts were made via email to interest
participants in participating in the researcher’s surveys. Less than 50% of the students
responded to the surveys. However, some findings were illustrative. Chai (2005) found
that there were significant high positive correlations between computer and information
literacy and the online course outcomes. Information literacy was not a skill that could be
learned from text, but instead needed experience and performance to improve. However it
was found that nurses, depending on the duties the administrative and research duties
they performed, were more information literate than were staff nurses who did not use the
online databases often. Chai (2005) suggested that there was a need for online classes to
be developed wherein nursing educators and librarians collaborated in order to create
classes that would improve the information literacy skills of nurses at the university.
Bulger’s (2009) quantitative dissertation was concerned with the performance of
150 University of California Santa Barbara graduate and undergraduate students on a 50minute writing and research task. This study examined the role of prior knowledge and
cognitive processing in online information literacy practice, challenging the assumption
that technology was all that the participants would need to complete their problemsolving task. There were 62 graduate student participants, who were teachers enrolled in
Technology for Teachers. There were 88 undergraduate student participants, the
undergraduate students were enrolled in a Writing 2 class and had passed the California
writing proficiency exam.
Bulger (2009) used software to record participant keystrokes, url visits, and active
applications during an assignment. Participants completed both a pre- and post-

152

questionnaire in a computer lab setting. Students also participated in an online reportwriting assignment related to the types of problem-solving tasks required in their classes.
Their task was to solve the problem. Bulger (2009) used Brand-Gruwel, Wopereis &
Vermetten’s (2005)’s product measures model to evaluate participant search strategies.
The post-questionnaire had 10 questions and focused on participant learning styles,
source credibility, evaluation practices, training and participation, and research and
teaching in the field.
Bulger (2009) found that there were different kinds of expertise. There was a
difference between how an expert would conduct a search and how a novice would
conduct a search.
“In particular, three kinds of knowledge were evaluated that may be relevant to
the [information searching] task:
1) Academic expertise: years in higher education: presumably resulting in
knowledge of academic scholarship,
2) Domain expertise (knowledge of and participation in the field of education),
and
3) Technical expertise: experience in using popular technology” (Bulger, p.76).
In addition, there were significant differences between how high and low
proficiency searchers (operationalized as an essay score), with graduate student and
undergraduate online search proficiency differences being highly significant
t (148) = -3.69, p = .000. Expertise follows practice. “These findings indicate that access
alone does not guarantee success on an academic research task, but rather, success results
from the interaction between students’ prior knowledge and the breadth of information
afforded by the Internet” (p. 83). Differences in process and expertise contributed to
efficient performance.

153

Bulger’s (2009) findings indicated that it was not possible to gain online
information literacy proficiency through participation in short information literacy
sessions (“one-shots”). Instead, it was by constant exposure to information literacy
concepts through continued task practice that was more useful. Factor analysis was used
to confirm that the writing task was both recursive and non-linear in process. It was found
that participants found the search process difficult and that increased Internet interaction
improved participant writing abilities. In addition, it was found that students who used
the copy-paste function of the word processer to organize materials while they searched
were demonstrating an indicator of information literacy. The final finding was that online
information literacy proficiency increased through continued practice.
Information Literacy Online Course
There were few information literacy online course dissertations. Of these, all
except one had such low return rates, population or sample sizes that their findings could
not be considered reliable or valid. Kammalocher (2009) studied the implementation of
online bibliographic instruction course modules at the University of Arizona, and how
these modules affected the learning experiences of General Biology and Education
students. The study sample contained 111 students at all class ranks from six sections of a
biology class and students from and undergraduate teacher education class. The
participants accessed three course web modules: the pre-test, modules on empirical
primary research articles learning and the post-test, which was made available to students
through web links on their subject-specific LibGuides. Student perceptions of learning
outcomes, the technology barriers they encountered, and the value and usability of
modules were explored through the completion of a 25-question survey. Pre- and post-

154

tests given during the study were used to measure student learning about empirical
research and peer-reviews and their responses were scored using a rubric. The pre- and
post-test scores were rated by the researcher and also by the librarian supporting these
classes with an inter-rater reliability 65% agreement.
Pre and post-tests given were used to measure student learning about empirical
research and peer-reviews and their responses were scored using a rubric. The pre-and
post-test scores were rated by the researcher and also by the librarian supporting these
classes with an inter-rater reliability 65% agreement. Kammalocher (2009) found that
there was a significant change in the General Biology and Education students’ confidence
levels when they identified and located empirical research and peer-reviewed articles.
Additionally, both the BIO 187 and the TEL 315 students performed better on the posttest than on the pre-test, in terms of students describing peer-reviewed articles in their
online learning modules. The students also had improved confidence levels for locating
peer-reviewed research articles by the post-test.
While the sample size was small, the Kammalocher (2009) findings are
significant because when students enter a for-credit information literacy course, they are
generally expected to participate in standardized information literacy pre-and post-tests.
These usually included testing their skills in relation to being able to identify peerreviewed and scholarly articles and how these are different from the other types of
published resources.
The findings show, that if students are exposed to scholarly and peer-reviewed
articles, they might not have encountered these previously, it is possible that with very
specific help, e.g. online library modules created to teach them how to locate scholarly

155

and peer-reviewed articles and on the web, they would be able to locate these much more
easily and with more confidence. This information literacy process would then increase
their level of proficiency from lower to higher, as both Bulger (2009) and Kammalocher
(2009) indicated in their studies.

Information Literacy Course Models
According to Davis, Lundstrom & Martin (2011) there are two models that are
commonly applied when information instruction is designed and developed in
institutions. There is a course- integrated and a for-credit model of information literacy
instruction. An additional model that is not emphasized because it is less common is the
not-for credit model which might also be applied in information literacy instruction.
Either model may or may not include course sequencing, meaning that courses that build
upon the content of each would be developed for students throughout their college
learning experience ranging from their first year through senior years. Thompson &
Lathey (2013) describes what an integrated micro-model of information literacy that is
based on psychological and learning theory models such as Alexanders’ (2003) model of
domain learning. Alexander’s (2003) model “emphasizes the central importance of
domain knowledge or student prior knowledge which the student uses to move from low
to high domain knowledge through “interest upon information inquiry, reading
comprehension, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge organization and extension”
(Para.12). Alexander (2003) explains how through this model each student progresses
from acclimation to competence and then to proficiency or expertise, but this is done very
differently depending on the individual and information literacy journey. At the stage of
acclimation, the student’s prior knowledge and domain knowledge starts to fuse and new

156

knowledge takes root because at this stage the student is becoming acclimatized to
academic inquiry and scholarship. At the stage of competence students demonstrate
cohesive, foundational knowledge, as the student has now chosen a major, has a grasp of
the discipline and is becoming more competent in their field of study. At the proficiency
stage the students become expert problem-solvers, as they have developed a strong
attachment to their field of study and are proficient in the discourse of their field and are
enabled to gather and report data in their field. Thompson & Lathey (2013) therefore
connects domain knowledge with information literacy, developing a new model which
impacts information literacy instruction, where domain learning, active learning and
strategic learning and consultation must be used together in information literacy
instruction for students to become information literate. Thompson & Lathey (2013)
suggests further that in using Alexander’s model at each stage, instructors must introduce
them to academics and immerse them in the disciplines. This can only be done if a wellstructured integrated information literacy program is put in place at an institution, and
subject-liaisons are employed to work with faculty in the disciplines and their students.
Badke (2005) describes a for-credit course model that was implemented where the
course became a compulsory pre-requisite for a subject-specific program and because of
its growth and online sections of the course were developed. The course was developed
using three models: an architectural model, where students were taught tool literacy, the
bibliographical model, where students were taught to develop references, cite sources and
explore subject-specific sources related to their discipline and the strategies model where
students were taught to understand the research process. The course was designed to be

157

offered to students as a for-credit course that was taught be a librarian and was designed
to teach only on information literacy topics.
Davis, Lundstrom & Martin (2011) conducted a study to explore librarian
perceptions and attitudes toward for-credit and course integrated library instruction. A
survey was presented to librarians on three librarian listervs and 276 librarians
participated, with 184 teaching only course integrated information literacy instruction, six
teaching for-credit only courses and 78 teaching both types of courses. Librarians
teaching for-credit courses only or course integrated library instruction only or both were
presented with different questions targeting the type of instruction they were teaching and
to their experience. Study findings indicated that 55.7% of institutions did not offer forcredit information literacy courses and of the 36.9% that offered it, 11.2% of the forcredit courses offered were mandatory to their students. 96.9% of participants offered
course integrated information literacy instruction, with 67.9% of participants offering
their students general workshops. When asked whether their students believed that forcredit information literacy course instruction was more effective instruction than course
integrated information literacy instruction 58.5% of participants were neutral, 26.6%
agreed and 15% agreed or strongly agreed that this was the case. When asked whether
their students believed that course integrated information literacy course instruction was
more effective instruction than for-credit information literacy instruction 54.2% of
participants were neutral, 30% agreed and 15.8% agreed or strongly agreed that this was
the case. Eighty-two percent of instructors agreed with the that the most effective format
of information literacy teaching model integrated instruction throughout the students’
coursework, beginning with course integrated composition classes and ending with

158

course integrated capstone courses. Findings suggested that instructors of both teaching
models were more likely to favor for-credit courses because these courses were longer
and were able to cover information literacy topics, often hands-on, that extended way
beyond the immediate student assignment.

Digital Literacy in Higher Education

The term digital literacy was first introduced by Gilster (1997) and is most
commonly described as “the confident and critical use of information and communication
technology (ICT) for work, leisure, learning and communication” (Hall, Nix & Baker,
2012). Hall, Nix & Baker (2012) further define digital literacy as being divided into two
skill sets: information literacy or the ability to find, evaluate and use information and
information and communication technology (ICT) which is the ability to organize,
present and share information, using computer software and social media resources when
using a computer. Digital literacy is more comprehensively defined as:
“the ability to use digital technology, communication tools or networks to locate,
evaluate, use and create information… the ability to understand and use
information in multiple formats from a wide range of sources when it is presented
via computers. A person’s ability to perform tasks effectively in a digital
environment… Literacy includes the ability to read and interpret media, to
reproduce data and images through digital manipulation, and to evaluate and
apply new knowledge gained from digital environments“(US Digital Literacy,
2014, Para. 3).

159

Digital literacy is an important skill that must be fostered in educational settings because
learning and preparation for entry to the workforce have become increasingly mediated
and refined by technology. As a result, students through educational exposure to digital
media and computer technology, must be prepared to develop capabilities that allow them
to thrive in a digital world beyond their education where digital formats and digital
communication is dominant and also where digital knowledge and ability is essential in
order to transfer their digital capabilities from one environment to another and become
immersed in digital and virtual environments. Student must be given the tools enabling
them to utilize databases, search engines, subject-based tools, learning management
systems and other digital technologies, because at present “every discipline and
profession” has been impacted by technology change. Every discipline uses “computerbased analytical tools” in different ways, and these have changed specific practices
within each discipline and also “how knowledge is generated, shared and described”
(Littlejohn, Beetham & McGill, 2012) in the discipline. Littlejohn, Beetham & McGill,
2012 suggested that colleges and universities must be willing to radically change how
they work with their students, and teach them to meet the challenges of digital learning
head-on by focusing on teaching them the skills that they struggle with them most, such
as how to evaluate research sources, develop critical research skills and problem-solve
real-world problems using digital technologies.
In a study conducted by Hall, Nix & Baker (2012) freshmen and sophomore
students enrolled in three social work and health and social care modules at the Open
University in the United Kingdom. These students participated in a survey that included
questions about student perceptions of the importance of digital literacy and information

160

literacy skills in their daily lives. Ninety-seven percent of student participants considered
information and communication technology (ICT) skills and information literacy skills to
be important if they were to enroll in future college courses, the other three percent
surveyed did not reply. Ninety-two percent of students considered these skills to be vital
to the employment setting, with eight percent of student respondents not replying to this
question. Eighty-two percent of students surveyed considered these skills to be important
when it came to personal pursuits and 18% of the students did not reply to this question.
Hall, Nix & Baker (2012) suggested that it was important to teach digital literacy to
students the context of the subject which they were studying, providing them with just-intime skills when needed for assignments and projects.

Digital Literacy Research

Two dissertations were found on digital literacy in college libraries: Belshaw’s
(2012) (The United Kingdom) and Amicucci’s (2013) (United States). The Belshaw
(2012) dissertation focused on understanding digital literacy from a philosophical stance.
It was a theoretical dissertation that did not include research using human subjects. In this
dissertation, Belshaw (2012) explored a variety of philosophical orientations, such as
critical theory post-structuralism, and decided that the best orientation for digital literacy
would be pragmatism. Pragmatism is a philosophical approach that assesses the truth and
the meaning of theories by attempting to apply them in practice. In this exploration of
digital literacy from a philosophical angle, Belshaw (2012) also considered the meaning
and truth related to information literacy and suggested that it was a way of thinking and a

161

liberal art, since students learned how to develop skills such as critical reflection,
evaluation and problem-solving in the classroom setting. Information literacy was viewed
as a matrix of critical and reflexive capabilities and a ‘habit of mind’ (Martin, 2008) that
taught students to have an attitude or to purposefully position themselves toward finding
the information that they sought. As such, information literacy required an improvement
in a student’s self-discipline, not as a state of achievement, rather than ongoing process,
wherein the graduate became a lifelong learner capable of using their information literacy
skills beyond the college environment.
Belshaw (2012) further suggested that since information literacy implementation
at colleges and universities was largely unsuccessful, it then became the new digital
literacy in the 21st century. Belshaw’s (2012) findings included that digital literacy was
viewed as an ambiguous term, since it was not possible to decide whether the emphasis
was on ‘digital’ or on literacy. Both were considered to be popular terms. However, the
terms would continue to be refined in the future in creative ways. As a result, digital
literacy was further defined in Belshaw’s dissertation as the carrying out of digital action
and was said to include photo-visual, reproduction, branching (non-linear to
hypertextual), information evaluation, and understanding and application of online
communication rules and skills. Digital literacy included a matrix of technology skills,
which are divided into functional access, such as networks, devices, services, software
and content (Martin 2008). Martin’s (2008) matrix was an overlapping one that explained
that digital literacy competence was foundational for information literacy, media literacy,
techno literacy and academic and techno-social practice.

162

Belshaw (2012) suggested that truth, according to pragmatist philosophers, was
conditional and dependent upon the community of inquirers who were using the terms in
a specific setting. As a result, a community could decide for themselves how they
wanted to define the terms “digital literacy.” Thus, academic librarians and others may
define the term “digital literacy” differently. When considering individuals to be digitally
literate, would be very similar, even if the application was different.
Amicucci (2013) conducted a mixed-methods (survey and in-depth interviews)
digital literacy study to discover non-academic uses of technology utilized by first-year
college students. The sample consisted of 177 freshmen interviewed at a Midwestern
University and eight students were chosen out of the sample for in-depth interviews. The
researcher also conducted four classroom visits during the study to conduct research.
Amicucci (2013) found that the students made a theoretical shift toward multiple
literacies, using many different digital tools and social spaces on a daily basis. Freshmen
used the following digital tools most: text messages (99%), Facebook reading (81%),
Facebook writing (48%), instant messaging (26%), Twitter (21%), and blogging (5%) on
a daily basis when creating content. When receiving information from others, freshmen
received 81% of their information through reading Facebook. Students were asked to
check off simultaneously what the other social media they used to get their information.
Fifty-seven percent of these students viewed Facebook photographs to glean information,
while Twitter was used 30% and YouTube viewing was used 39% of the time by these
students on a daily basis.
Amicucci (2013)’s study found that students used social media multiple times
daily for non-academic information. The study also found that freshman received much

163

more content than they themselves actually created. Much of participants’ description of
their digital literacy activity fit within Street’s (2003) definition of literacy as a social
practice in personal use “literacy is a social practice not simply a technical and neutral
skill” (p.77). However, the majority of students did see these types of social media as
being useful for academic writing. While the researcher had hoped to find that there
would be a connection for students between social media in personal use and then adapt
this media to academic writing, the findings indicated that students separated the two.
In summary, these two studies shed little light on the relationship between digital
and information literacy in terms of the connection between student personal
technological use and academic information literacy, so the relationship appears to be
unclear. Belshaw (2012) reasoned that digital literacy was the foundation of information
literacy and that information literacy was part of the ongoing process of lifelong learning.
However, when considering Belshaw’s (2102) philosophy against the results of
Amicucci’s (2013) study of personal student use of social media, it is probable that social
media practices, e.g. Facebook, etc., are dissimilar to information literacy practices in the
academic sense. While Amicucci (2013) tried to find an interface between social media
and information literacy, students found the two uses of technology unrelated. Students
were steeped in social media; yet saw little or no connection to the information literacy
that is required for academic success and lifelong learning.

Chapter Summary

The chapter began with a theoretical framework for the study, a description of the
development of the concept of information literacy and describes the history of information
164

literacy. In the conceptual framework and major reports section of the chapter, the term

“information literacy” was defined, how information literacy moved into its current
position of prominence in higher education, and then defined the term “Information
Literacy” as it was described and understood in the Association of College and Research
Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000).
There were four major reports: A Nation at risk (1983), Newman’s Education
Commission of the States (1985), Libraries and the search for academic excellence
(1987) and The Presidential Committee on Information Literacy Final Report (1989) and
their findings were presented. The American Library Association-Association of College
and Research Libraries (1989, 1998) reports described the path to be taken in establishing
information literacy in community, business and education settings, in the creation of
National Forum on Information Literacy. It also described the development of the
Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Standards for Higher
Education (2000) and the progress made in implementing information literacy in the
United States over the last 14 years. It described the broadening of information literacy
by explaining information literacy theory, some of the information literacy components
used in the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) and the revised Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016).
In the Information Literacy and Higher Education section of the chapter,
technological changes in the 1990s led to educational reforms that sparked an interest in
and an implementation of information literacy programs in college and university
General Education programs in which lifelong learning was an essential part of college

165

and university mission statements. Institutional approaches to information literacy
program development and implementation differed and depended on the motivations and
interests of college and university administrators. Information Literacy assessment and
authentic assessment were considered vital to information literacy programs.
In the Information Literacy and the University Library section the library
stakeholder was defined, along with the role played in information literacy. The
importance of understanding student perceptions of the library and the need for facultylibrarian collaboration when integrating it into the college or university curriculum was
also discussed. The chapter is concluded with digital literacy dissertations, which are
described and analyzed.

Chapter 3 - Methodology and Data Analysis

Introduction

In this chapter the research methods and procedures used in the study are
described in detail, including the research questions, the rationale for qualitative
methodology, and the case study rationale. That is followed by a description of the
participating institutions, research location course offerings, research settings curriculum,
research plan, participants of the study, qualitative collection and analysis methods that
were employed and concludes with the trustworthiness of the research, the ethical
considerations regarding this research study and a chapter summary.

Research Questions

The research questions relating to the development of information literacy courses
in exemplary colleges and universities in the United States were as follows:
1. How are selected four-year colleges implementing exemplary information literacy
courses?
2. How do exemplary four-year college library information literacy courses
implementing the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy in Higher Education (2016)?

167

3. How do exemplary four-year colleges and universities implement digital literacy
and the six frames of the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)?

What is the role of the Researcher?

According to Danish researcher, Anne Fink (2000), the role of the qualitative
researcher is to conduct their qualitative study by designing it so that it followed the
accepted qualitative research process. First, the researcher asked the answers to the
fundamental research questions regarding the topic being studied then were transcribed
and analyzed. It was the researcher’s responsibility to locate appropriate research subjects
that could provide them with information they required to answer the questions posed.
Then it is the researcher’s responsibility to follow accepted qualitative procedures to
collect qualitative data and analyze the data collected. The researcher’s coding techniques
defined and categorized the phenomena studied and determined the relationships between
the categories identified. Fink (2000) identified the thematizing (creating themes),
designing, interviewing and transcribing, analyzing, verifying and reporting processes as
the purview of the qualitative researcher. The researcher made decisions relating to the
techniques of data collection, the integrity of the data, the actual character of the data
collected, the data processing that was completed and the final presentation of the data
analysis and results.

168

Rationale for Qualitative Research

This qualitative multiple case study was viewed through a theoretical lens in order
to solve problems that were faced by a very specific population. Qualitative research is
inductive and shaped by the data collection process. Cresswell (2013) stated that as the
researcher gathers information, conducts interviews, observations and documents during
their qualitative study; they have to make their own assumptions about what they
encountered during the study. They must consider probable solutions to the problems
being explored. Secondly, this understanding then provides the researcher with ideas
about how to conduct their study and which combination of methods of analysis to use
and how best to describe their study. In the continued search for meaning, the
researcher’s role is to understand the results of their study and be able to interpret these
using their theoretical lenses. Yet at the same time, the researcher has to remain open to
continuing to question and describe what they have encountered and clarify the
information they have gathered, mapping it to theory when this is possible or developing
alternative theories if these are required to explain study results. The researcher’s
approach to the problem is a very distinctive inquiry focused on the meaning of what
participants are imparting. The researcher understands that there are multiple views that
emerge from the interviews and additional resources gathered during the study and that
these needed to be interpreted at different levels of complexity. According to Cresswell
(2013), there are key steps to be followed by the researcher in order to complete a
qualitative research study. Figure 3.1 below, simplifies and describes the steps of the
qualitative research process.

Key steps during the Qualitative Research Process

approaches. (3rd.). Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.

This study utilizes a qualitative multiple case study approach to measure how the
researcher understands, describes and explores the research problems. Using qualitative
research methods, the researcher explores how exemplary four-year colleges and
universities were implementing information literacy courses and how these colleges and
universities implement the Association of College and Research Libraries Information
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000), and the American College
and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)
in their courses and to what extent digital literacy courses are incorporated in these
exemplary courses.
This is a multiple case study, which utilizes qualitative research methods and
consists of qualitative interviews with librarians at each of the colleges selected for study.
Gall et al (1996) defined case study research as “the in-depth study of instances of a
phenomenon in its natural context and from the perspective of the participants involved
in the phenomenon” (p.545). The eight case studies in the study contained stories that
were based on the perspectives of librarians participating in information literacy
170

instruction and administration. “The case study approach allowed the researcher to”
explore curriculum development, administration and leadership within the instructional
environment, thus allowing for understanding the behavior of instructors “in the context
of wider forces operating within and outside the institutions studied.
Denzin & Lincoln (2004) defined qualitative research as a situated activity that
locates the observer in the world. It consists of a set of material practices that makes the
world visible. These practices transform the world. They turn the world into a series of
representations, including field notes, interviews, conversations, photographs, recordings,
and memos to the self…qualitative research involves and interpretative, naturalistic
approach to the world” (p.3).
A case study is defined as an “account of an activity, event or problem that
contains a real or hypothetical situation and includes the complexities you would
encounter in the workplace. Case studies are used to help researchers see how the
complexities of real-life influence decisions” (University of New South Wales, Sydney,
2017). “Qualitative methodologists…accept this conception of the comparative method
as a strategy for conducting research of naturally occurring phenomena in a way that
controls for potential confounding variables through careful case selection and matching
rather than through experimental manipulation or partial correlations. This suggests that
the logic of inference is quite similar in statistical and comparable case methods” (Levy,
2008). This study is a set of eight case studies, a multiple case study that uses an
explanatory case study (Yin, 2003) within its design. The explanatory case study involves
searching for answers to questions that explain causal links in real-life interventions that
are too complex for the implementation of survey and experimental studies. This

171

methodology is useful when studying program development and linking program
implementation with its effects (Yin, 2003). In this study, faculty from eight colleges and
universities were asked to describe and discuss their information literacy programs, and
more specifically, how and why they were designed, how they were unique and why they
chose to apply to become an exemplary program. They were also asked how the
exemplary program status affected their library and university and what changes or
additions were being made to their programs following this national status. Course and
program designs were considered, analyzed and compared with one another, and
similarities, differences, and points from which to learn were identified. It is to be
understood that Research “Methodology” implies more than… the methods… intended
“to use to collect data. It is often necessary to include a consideration of the concepts and
theories which underlie the methods” (University of Manchester, 2017). Methodology is
different from ‘method’ in that the latter is the step-by-step processes that are required for
the entire methodology to work, while the methodology is also about the right tools that
are selected by the researcher in order for the “science’ behind the methodology to work
in the study.
Yin (2003) defined a descriptive case study design as one that allowed the
researcher to explore the phenomenon that was information literacy and how it was
interpreted by the universities in the study. At the same time information literacy
interventions that were used at different colleges and universities in the study were
explored. There was also the opportunity to qualitatively explore the differences and
similarities within and between cases and replicate findings across cases, thus drawing
comparisons between cases through careful interpretation so that similar or contrasting

172

results could be predicted through cross-case analysis. This research study sought to
better understand how the different institutions had implemented information literacy
programs, how these programs implemented technology in their courses, and also how
they implemented the Association of College and Research Libraries Information
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) and the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) in their curricula and used rubrics to
assess their programs. Each program was unique and was treated as a unique case.
Interviews were conducted with the program directors and one or more instruction
librarians at each of the institutions participating in the study and further analyzed. Figure
3.1 describes how each case was handled allowing for the collection of qualitative
artifacts. These would help the researcher understand the information literacy program’s
history, creation, intervention process, ongoing changes in the department, as well as
social and political events that had influenced and shaped each program.

Multiple Case Study Rationale

Yin (2009) defined the case study as a type of research that involved studying a
phenomenon in context, where the findings of the study were then explained and how and
why the phenomenon had occurred in a particular situation. In this case study, one of the
questions focused on how exemplary information literacy programs are implemented.
According to Yin (2009), the case study is a qualitative method that does not
control or manipulate behavioral events, but instead focuses on contemporary events,
thereby allowing “investigators to retain the holistic and meaningful characteristics of
real-life” (p. 8). The case study method is used for three purposes that Yin (2009) defined
as explanatory, exploratory and descriptive. Stake (1995) added additional case study
purposes such as intrinsic when exploring unique traits and instrumental when attempting
to gain insight into the case studied.
According to Yin (2009) case studies are most often done when researchers asked
‘why’ and ‘how’ questions because they are more explanatory and do not require
enumeration, as do what questions. The strengths of the case study design are that it
allowed the researcher to gather a rich array of information sources while conducting
interviews, observations and gathering documents. Artifacts and field-notes can then be
analyzed using a multitude of qualitative analyses. Yin (2009) pointed out that an
additional benefit to using a case study design is that “prior development of theoretical
propositions” cab be used to guide the “data collection and analysis” (p. 18).
Yin (2004) described a multiple case study as the type of study where more than
one unique case relating to a phenomenon was studied and where each case remained
“within the same methodological framework” (p. 45). Every case in the study served a
174

very specific purpose within the inquiry and could not be replicated, so that each was
either predictive of the ultimate results at the conclusion of the study or produced
“contrasting results for predictable reasons.” The analysis of each case was then done
within and across cases in the study in “a rich theoretical framework” which then became
the “vehicle for generalization to new cases” or enabled the modification of the theories
used (Yin 2004, p.45).

Description of Research Participants

Thirteen universities were described on the Association of College and Research
Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices: Exemplary Programs website, receiving a
status as exemplary programs. Fourteen institutions with information literacy programs
were contacted out of the fifteen exemplary programs listed on the Best Practices:
Exemplary Programs website. One program was a non-United States program. The
researcher chose to exclude non-United States programs to limit the costs associated with
this study. Three colleges did not reply to telephone messages or email contacts made by
the researcher and were thus not included in the study. One university’s program director
was on sabbatical and another college was going through program revision and was
therefore unable to participate. As a result, eight programs were included in the study
from the Association of College and University Libraries Exemplary Information
Literacy Programs listed on the Association of College and Research Libraries
Information Literacy Best Practices: Exemplary Programs website (2002, 2012).
Table 3.1 below lists the eight colleges and universities chosen for the sample,
along with their locations, institution types, and undergraduate student population
175

information. There are two private colleges, one public comprehensive university, two
public land-grant institution and three public universities. The two private colleges have
student population headcounts below 7,000. The medium-sized public universities have
student headcounts ranging from above 10,000 to just below 14,600 and two large public
universities, one with an undergraduate student headcount just below 24,000 and the
second with a headcount of 29,497 undergraduate students. Five universities belong to
larger public university systems.

Research Locations and Programs

There are eight colleges and universities in the sample. The study included eight
college cases where exemplary information literacy programs were offered and these
were viewed through the theoretical lenses of the Association of College and Research
Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) and
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016). The research location
description of each exemplary program is summarized from the category description
provided by each library regarding their fit with a specific exemplary category on the

Category 10: Assessment/Evaluation

Augustana College
Augustana College is a private, undergraduate Liberal Arts College located in
Rock Island, Illinois. The college was founded in 1860, is affiliated with the Evangelical
Lutheran Church and offers 36 undergraduate majors and pre-professional degrees but no
graduate programs. The college has a 12:1 faculty ratio. In 2014, the college enrolled
2,524 undergraduate students of who were 57% female and 43% were male students
(Cappex, 2014; Augustana College, 2015).
Augustana College’s commitment to information literacy was demonstrated
through sustained administrative and faculty support of the library and the program.
Librarians collaborated with classroom faculty to incorporate information literacy into the
curriculum. Students in first year seminar visited the library during the year and liaison
179

librarians worked in partnership with faculty to place information literacy into
disciplines. Freshmen participated in a required sequence of five information literacy
instruction sessions, and upper-level students received discipline-specific information
literacy instruction in their majors. Librarians aligned first-year information literacy
learning outcomes and collaborated on upper-level information literacy instruction and
outcomes. Collaboration was extended to the broader community since the library
outreach coordinator connected with the local high schools to schedule special research
days in the library. Faculty at the college approved “critical thinking/information
literacy” as one of eight college-wide student-learning outcomes. Augustana College
facilitated information literacy through the regular participation of librarians on collegelevel committees, such as the General Education and Assessment Committees. The
university has sustained a commitment to the professional development of librarians that
resulted in frequent librarian presentations and attendance at national conferences, e.g.
the Association of College and Research Libraries Immersion program (Association of
College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices, Categories four &
six, 2015; Augustana College, 2015; Cappex, 2014).
California State University, San Marcos
California State University, San Marcos, is one of the 23 independent campuses
in the California State University System. The university was founded in 1989. California
State University, San Marcos is located in San Diego, in Northern San Diego County.
The campus has five colleges in the fields of Humanities, Arts and Behavioral Sciences;
Business Administration; Science and Mathematics; Education; and Health and Human
Services. It also has interdisciplinary and extended learning departments serving both

180

undergraduate and graduate students. In 2014, undergraduate students numbered 10,675
undergraduate students 60% female, and 40% male, as well as 348 graduate students
were enrolled on the campus (Cappex, 2014; California State University, San Marcos,
2015).
California State University, San Marcos Library’s librarians were responsible for
outreach and considered it to be a core function of their information literacy program.
They partnered with disciplinary faculty to provide information literacy instruction and to
integrate it across the curriculum and grow instructor-student relations via instructional
experiences in the classroom and during reference encounters with students. Librarians
strove to develop students’ understanding of the inquiry process. The Outreach Librarian
at the university coordinated the curricular-based “Context: Library Series” and the
Common Read. In collaboration with disciplinary faculty, the outreach librarian created
assignments and learning opportunities for students related to their shared intellectual
experiences. The Institutional Repository Librarian worked with faculty and university
administration on issues surrounding scholarly communication and intellectual property
(Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices,
Category nine: outreach, 2015; California State University, 2015, Cappex, 2014).
Loyola Marymount University
Loyola Marymount University is a private Jesuit university located in residential
Los Angeles, California, and was founded in 1911. The university has an average
undergraduate class size of 21 and a faculty to student ratio of 11:1. In 2014, the
university enrolled 6,604 undergraduate students, (57% female and 43% male) 2,189
graduate students and 1,142 law students. The university has four colleges including
181

Liberal Arts, Science and Engineering Business Administration, Communication and
Fine Arts and three Schools of Education, Law and Film and Television (Loyola
Marymount University, 2015).
Loyola Marymount University’s new core curriculum was the catalyst for the
librarians at the University Library to sequentially integrate information literacy across
the curriculum. Information literacy outcomes were then embedded into core classes,
specifically into first-year seminars and “Rhetorical Arts” courses, allowing students to
further their information literacy skills by taking a “flagged course” within their
discipline. The flags indicated the courses students could choose from, since these were
earmarked to fulfilled skill and knowledge area requirements, and included information
literacy. “The sequentially”, integrated information literacy program was aligned “with
the mission and vision” of Loyola Marymount University (Association of College and
Research Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices, Exemplary Programs, 2015).
Loyola Marymount librarians successfully collaborated on the formal articulation of
information literacy into the university curriculum, which started with the inclusion of
novice-level information literacy learning outcomes in the First Year Seminar where the
information literacy instruction was delivered through an online tutorial with embedded
graded assignments. The second phase of articulation occurred in the second semester of
the freshman year and built onto the first phase. Librarians collaborated with course
developers on assignments and graded rubrics. The third phase was the most innovative,
requiring students to take flagged courses within their majors. Librarians helped design
assignments and provide subject-specific library instruction. The combination of
university-level adoption of information literacy into the core curriculum and the

182

librarian-created scaffolding approach of introducing, reinforcing, and enhancing
information literacy outcomes made this information literacy program a model program
(Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices,
Categories two & five, 2015; Loyola Marymount University, 2015, Cappex, 2014).
Purdue University
Purdue University was founded in 1869, as a land-grant university in West
Lafayette, Indiana. The university offers programs at the main campus and it also
collaborates with Indiana University at its Fort Wayne Campus to offer programs. The
university offers certificates, associates, bachelors and graduate degrees. The university
has nine colleges, which includes a Division of Continuing Studies and a Unit of
Affiliated Programs. In Fall 2015 the university had at total enrollment of 39,409 students
including 29, 497 undergraduate students, 938 professional students and 8,974 graduate
students enrolled on the campus (Cappex, 2014, Purdue University, 2015).
Purdue University was listed as exemplary in three ACRL Categories: Category
4--Administrative & Institutional Support, Category 6--Collaboration and Category 9-Outreach. According to the ACRL website (ACRL Information Literacy Best Practices:
Exemplary Programs) Purdue’s librarians participated in discussion at all levels of their
University in order to be in the position to communicate the value of information literacy
in higher education to their colleagues. According to librarians at Purdue University,
instruction librarians were committed to working with faculty to integrate information
literacy into their “new core curriculum both at the foundational level, for general
education outcomes, and at the embedded level, requiring each discipline to incorporate
this ability” into their own undergraduate programs (ACRL Information Literacy Best

183

Practices: Exemplary Programs, 2015). Their librarians collaborated with faculty and
served on curriculum committees as advisors, infusing information literacy strategies into
large introductory courses that were led and redesigned by librarians through the
University’s IMPACT program (Instruction Matters: Purdue Academic Course
Transformation). In response to the university's Foundations of Excellence Initiative,
libraries’ faculty also worked to integrate information literacy into the student first-year
experience at the university. They taught and co-taught courses in other campus interview
comments, such as in the Science and Honors Colleges. Library Departmental liaison
librarians worked with faculty members “to offer instruction in a variety of modes” while
also “maintaining alignment with disciplinary-based information literacy content... due
to the librarians' influence. “Purdue's 2008-2014 Strategic Plan” included information
literacy as “an expected learning outcome at within the foundational core curriculum and
embedded at the disciplinary level” (Association of College and Research Libraries
Information Literacy Best Practices: Exemplary Programs, 2015, Para. 20). Librarians
were also responsible for editing and producing an annual publication, a library
newsletter and library displays that added additional value to community. They also
hosted a blog and provided press releases about activities on the Campus. The "Cool
Signs" display in Purdue Libraries was created by using animated video on LCD screens
for instructional and marketing messages. Information Literacy Month was celebrated by
the community in October with banners, press releases and events put on for the students
by librarians (Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Best
Practices: Exemplary Programs, 2015; Purdue University, 2015, Cappex, 2014).

184

University of Nevada, Las Vegas
The University of Nevada, Las Vegas was founded in 1957, as a branch campus of
the University of Nevada, Reno. The University of Nevada, Las Vegas is a public/private
partnership, partnering with Majestic Realty Company, a real estate company owned by
Edward P. Roski, having offices throughout the United States. The university
transformed itself over the years from a small branch college to a research institution.
The university has 17 academic interview comments that included Business, Allied
Health, Nursing, Community Health and Dental Health Schools and Colleges of
Engineering, Education, Liberal Arts, Sciences and Urban Affairs. In 2014, the university
enrolled 28,515 students, 23,813, of whom were undergraduate students and 4,715 were
graduate students; (45% male and 55% female students) (University of Nevada, 2015,
Cappex. 2014).
The University of Nevada, Las Vegas librarians maintained a well-developed
“shared values” statement that was connected to information literacy, lifelong learning
and partnered with the university’s educational mission. The University Undergraduate
Learning Outcomes (UULOs), which were required of all undergraduate students, and
were aligned to the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000). The University Libraries created an
Instruction Framework, which recommended “a roadmap and tools for strategic
development of the University Libraries’ instruction efforts" (p. 23). Librarians
integrated, mapped, and scaffolded information literacy learning at all undergraduate
levels. “UNLV Libraries lead a faculty development initiative, which was called the
UNLV Libraries Faculty Institutes (https://www.library.unlv.edu/faculty/institute/) aimed
at collaboration with instructional faculty to integrate learning outcomes, including
185

critical thinking and inquiry, into course syllabi” (Association of College and Research
Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices: Exemplary Programs, 2015, Para.22) with
numerous partnerships between the library and other academic interview comments. The
Faculty Institutes began in 2010. These institutes represented the recognition of
librarians' expertise in matters of instructional design and a foundation for further
collaboration between librarians and course instructors on the university’s campuses
(Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices,
Categories three, six & seven, 2015; University of Nevada, 2015, Cappex. 2014).
University of North Carolina, Wilmington
The University of North Carolina, Wilmington is a public university located in
Wilmington, North Carolina. Wilmington College was opened in 1946 under the
Directorate of Extension of the North Carolina College Conference and the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill and started out enrolling 250 freshmen. In 1963 the college
became a senior four-year college and in 1969 it officially became the University of
North Carolina, Wilmington. In 2014 the university enrolled 12,993 undergraduate and
1,618 graduate students. The university currently offers 55 bachelor’s degree programs in
49 majors, 42 master’s degree programs and two doctoral programs (Cappex, 2014;
University of North Carolina, Wilmington, 2015).
Information Literacy was one of the University of North Carolina Wilmington’s
learning goals, achieved through their General Education curriculum (called “University
Studies”) that clearly defined the requirements for student information literacy
competency. Students were required to complete nine hours of information literacy
intensive courses beginning with the First Year Seminar and extending into the major.

186

Each course that was approved as an information literacy intensive course underwent a
rigorous evaluation process that was part of an ongoing information literacy assessment
and program improvement process at the university. Librarians worked on the University
Studies requirements through the scoring of course proposals for the information literacy
category of courses and by serving as the information literacy experts during universitywide assessments. The librarians led the integration of sequential, scaffolded instruction
throughout each student’s information literacy exposure and assessed information literacy
at the session, course, program and institutional levels. The university conducted a pilot
program to test transfer students on information literacy skills, so that all students were
required to demonstrate their information literacy skills prior to their graduation
(Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices,
Categories five & ten, 2015; University of North Carolina, Wilmington, 2015, Cappex,
2014).
University of Rhode Island
The University of Rhode Island is located in Kingston, Rhode Island and is a
public, comprehensive university. The university was founded as a land-grant institution
and offers students a broad liberal arts education. The university offers 80 undergraduate
programs and a smaller offering of graduate programs. In 2014, the university enrolled
13,528 undergraduate students, 53% female and 46% male and 3,023 graduate students
(Cappex, 2014; University of Rhode Island, 2015).
The University of Rhode Island Libraries information literacy plan was created in
2014 to articulate the mission, vision, goals and objectives of the university. These were
then constantly revisited by information literacy instructors. Assessment was

187

incorporated into all information literacy efforts. A rubric that was based on the
Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education (2000) was developed and tested for use in any course
that was intended to satisfy the Information literacy requirement of the general education
program. A curriculum map set out laddered information literacy learning goals for
various course levels at the university. The information literacy instruction plan mapped
all information literacy instruction across the curriculum at both the discipline level and
the course level, from a pre-freshman “Talent Development” initiative to capstone
courses across the disciplines. The University of Rhode Island approved a general
education Program that included information literacy as an outcome that all students had
to attain, required for all courses and programs that included information literacy
instruction. The General Education Program required information literacy competency
through scaffolding and incremental approach, and woven throughout the four-years of a
student’s program of study. Students could then fulfill their information literacy
requirement by taking a three-credit hour information literacy course or by fulfilling a
sequence of information literacy opportunities including an information literacy tutorial,
engagement with information literacy in Freshman Seminar, a Writing Course, a
Communications Course and an upper level integrative course. The Library’s information
literacy program also offered both credit bearing courses and comprehensive outreach
courses to freshmen engineering students. Librarians took full advantage of technologyintegrated classrooms to assess student learning in credit-bearing courses through the
presentation of projects (Association of College and Research Libraries Information

188

Literacy Best Practices, Categories two, five & seven, 2015; University of Rhode Island,
2015, Cappex, 2014).
Utah State University
Utah State University is a public land-grant research university located in Logan,
Utah. The university was founded in 1888 as an agricultural college and became Utah
State University in 1957. The university has two comprehensive regional campuses: Utah
State University Eastern, Price and Utah State University, Blanding, 19 regional
campuses and an online distance education program. The university offers 168 degrees,
94 minors and 143 graduate degrees and has a student-faculty ratio of 21:4. The
university offers rolling admission and admits 98.5% of students who apply. In 2014, the
university enrolled 16,472 students, of whom 14,573 were undergraduates and 1,826
were graduate students. In 2015, the university enrolled 24,385 students; 46% were male
and 54% were female, including 18,491 students from out of state (Cappex, 2014; Utah
State University, 2015).
Utah State University Libraries conducted rubric assessments of student papers to
revise learning outcomes and curricula using mixed-methods to explore the impact of
sequenced integration in academic programs. Comprehensive yearly annual reports,
rubric assessment data, and assessment tools were used to assess information literacy at
the university. The Outreach and Peer Learning Coordinator led collaboration with a
wide range of campus partners, from the Access & Diversity Office to the Writing
Center. Librarians participated in university departmental programs and employed
diverse outreach and communication methods to engage students at the university.
Librarians took a collaborative approach to library instruction by developing learning

189

outcomes in partnership with academic faculty. This collaboration resulted in the
development of new approaches to instruction being applied, that included the teaching
of critical thinking skills and developing programs integrating threshold concepts into
teaching practice in the information literacy programs offered to students. Librarians used
technology and innovative approaches such as flipped classrooms with built in
accountability structures such as discussion and quizzes for students. Librarians also
made very efficient use of their time by focusing on individual students and helping them
to meet their research needs (Association of College and Research Libraries Information
Literacy Best Practices, Categories seven, nine & ten; 2015; Utah State University, 2015,
Cappex, 2014).

Expert Panel

Three information literacy librarian experts, selected because of professional
reputation, were asked to review the qualitative questions that would be posed to
participants during interviews (Appendix I). Before beginning the study, however, each
expert was asked to make additional suggestions about questions. The experts were
librarians who had expertise in information literacy program development, implementing
information literacy courses and in creating course outcomes and applying them. The
three librarians on the expert panel were actively involved in the process of coordinating,
developing and improving information literacy programs at their colleges and universities
were asked to serve as experts on the panel since they would have a good idea of what
questions to ask of best practices programs that had been established and were working
well.
190

The librarians on the Expert Panel were as follows:
o Caleb Puckett is the Instruction Librarian hired to begin the information literacy
initiative and develop the information literacy course at a Kansas College. Caleb
worked as a consultant for the School of Education at the University of Kansas
and has since moved into an instructional design position at Grantham University.
o Amy Fyn is Coordinator of Library Instruction at Coastal Carolina University in
South Carolina and incoming chair of the Association of College and Research
Libraries Instruction Section Best Practices Committee, 2015-2016.
o Alysia Starkey is Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies at Kansas State
University. She is a former library director at Kansas State University Polytechnic
and has published on distance learning in higher education.

Participants of the Study

The population of the study consisted of librarians from eight colleges and
universities chosen from the list of fifteen colleges and universities that had been listed as
Association of College and Research Libraries Exemplary Information Literacy program
on the Association of College and Research Libraries website. The website had contact
information for each library listed. Emails were sent to each university listed, and then
these were followed up by phone calls. The researcher called the information literacy
program directors/coordinators at each of the universities to make an initial contact and
was told that each would participate in the study. The directors of each of the programs
suggested that they would be the best contact to interview about their programs. The
researcher asked information literacy program directors for additional information
191

literacy staff contacts that would be willing to participate in interviews. Interviews lasted
between 45 minutes and 60 minutes. Three librarians were interviewed at each exemplary
library, except at Purdue University where only two librarians were willing to participate
in the interviews. A total of 23 participants were interviewed. Twenty-two participated in
interviews and one completed a survey due to a disability that did not allow the
participant to interact easily with the researcher on the telephone. The same questions
were asked during each telephone interview. The differing number of interviews did not
compromise or impact the researcher’s findings.

Once participant contact information was gathered from each initial contact, the
researcher contacted each additional participant by email to invite her/him to participate
in the study. If a reply was received, an interview time was determined. The researcher
kept the above Study Participant List in 3.2, as a rough list and updated it each time an
interview had been scheduled or completed. Each librarian received the participant letter
in Appendix B created for interviewees and a participant consent form in Appendix C
that was signed and completed. There was enough contact with participants, for the
researcher to answer any questions that each had prior to the interviews.

Program Selection Criteria
Two selection criteria were applied to the Information Literacy programs that are
included in the study. They were: (a) Colleges and universities included on the
Association of College and Research Libraries’ information literacy best practices
exemplary programs list and (b) Colleges and universities that were in the process of
implementing or had implemented a course or courses or a program with either of the
following components for sharing course content: completely online content, online
learning objects, online tutorials, a blended or completely online course(s) or a face-toface program that were being transferred into an online format. The researcher included
this selection criteria to be inclusive of all delivery modes. As a result the researcher
included a variety of online teaching formats that were being used by librarians to teach
information literacy at colleges and universities.
Participants were chosen because they were often the only authorities on the
topic, having the specialized knowledge that was required to answer specific questions in
a case study. The participants were chosen because they were program coordinators,
194

faculty or administrators involved in their college or university’s exemplary information
literacy program and who served as leaders at these colleges or universities when it came
to creating, developing and revising information literacy curriculum.
Participant Selection Criteria
There were selection criteria that must be applied to the participants chosen to
participate in this study. The participants chosen had to be: (a) program coordinators,
administrators, faculty, instruction librarians or library adjuncts associated with one of
the eight programs exemplary programs in the sample. Staff must be serving in either a
full-time or part-time capacity at the university and (b) associated with the program for
more than one semester as an instructor, librarian, administrator, program coordinator,
faculty member or an adjunct. (The latter is important because librarians often move to
new positions, and the researcher wanted to be sure that librarians with solid knowledge
of their college’s information literacy program were interviewed).

Sampling Procedures

Snowball sampling was defined as “a (non-random) sampling method used when”
the “characteristics to be possessed by samples are rare and difficult to find” (ResearchMethodology, 2016, Para. 1). This was the case with choosing participants for this study
of exemplary information literacy programs. Since only thirteen exemplary information
literacy institutions had participated in the Association of College and Research Libraries
competition, to identify themselves with one or more of the ten exemplary criteria, the
researcher chose the participants for this study from the list of institutions available on

195

the American College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices:
Exemplary Programs. There were no other alternatives available. Thus, exponential
discriminative snowball sampling was used in this study, where participants gave
“multiple referrals” were made, as participants gave the researcher two more contacts to
interview from each of the colleges. Their participant “choice of a new subject” offered
to the participant was “guided by the aim and objectives of the study” (Para.7), since the
researcher sent each initial contact a letter laying out these study aims and objectives and
the questions to be asked of each participant.
Snowball sampling was further defined by Jupp (2006) and referred to as a form
of Purposive sampling. This was “a form of sampling that Jupp (2006) defined purposive
sampling as “a form of non-probability sampling in which decisions concerning the
individuals to be included in the sample” were “taken by the researcher, based upon a
variety of criteria which… included specialist knowledge of the research issue, or
capacity and willingness to participate in the research” (Jupp, 2006, p. 123). Tongco
(2007) stated that this sampling technique, which was also referred to as judgment
sampling, is a common sampling technique used in qualitative research where the
researcher made a judgment call or a very deliberate choice regarding the participants
that are to be included in their study. Purposive sampling is often used when the chosen
participants had very specific information to impart (Jupp, 2006).
Document Analysis
The process of document analysis and why this process was important was
described in this section. Bowen (2009) defined document analysis as “a systematic
procedure for reviewing or evaluating documents” (p. 27) that were either printed or
196

electronic materials gathered during the study. Documents gathered from participants had
a direct relationship to the study and documented participant activities in relation to the
topic researched were gathered during the study process. These documents were
“examined and interpreted in order to elicit meaning, gain” an “understanding and
develop empirical knowledge” (Bowen, 2009, p. 27) and were used as a means of
triangulation, allowing the researcher to draw on multiple “sources of evidence” (p.28),
thereby, “providing a confluence of evidence that” was able to breed “credibility”
(Eisner, 1991, p. 101). Bowen (2009) also stated that was efficient and often costeffective, much less obtrusive to some study participants, and considered to be much
more stable and exact. Documents collected during a study associated with the
phenomenon being studied often described events and provided a more detailed
description of them than from the participant or even a college or university’s point of
view. In case of the latter, it was probable that the documents also portrayed biases, due
to organizational policy, process and procedure that might have been described in detail
in documents that were created.
The researcher collected documents, handouts and website information after each
interview relating to the information literacy programs the participants worked in. In
qualitative research, researchers are encouraged to gather documents that could be used
be provide improved interpretation of the study. This document collection is backed up
by the literature. According to Bowen (2009) document analysis was useful when
conducted during a research study because it provided the researcher with additional
background information about the phenomenon, additional historical insights into past
events related to it, and tracked changes and developments relating to the topic.

197

Document analysis was also useful to the researcher to better understand how a program
had fared or changed over time. Document analysis also supplemented data collected
from interviews during the research study and helped the researcher to generate new
questions during the study that could then open the discussion in areas that were not
initially included in it. Documents that were important to shape this study included
program descriptions that were collected prior to the interviews from the participants, as
well as electronic documents available on the web or on Libguides explaining curricula
concepts.

Research Design

Bogdan & Biklen (1992) stated that when the researcher started the data
collection process it was common that they might not know what analysis methods to use
with the study. They would however, gain the chance to review and explore the data they
collected and see, and armed with their knowledge of correct qualitative data analysis
procedures to aid them, would be able to determine how best to proceed.
In this case study, the researcher conducted two or three in-depth semi-structured
individual interviews at each of the eight research sites, and collected additional data
from field-notes and additional documentation such as reports, curriculum documents
gathered from participants and library websites. The data collected from each of the 23
interviews were organized into 23 survey sets so that they could be auto-coded, using
both open and thematic (axial) coding and further analyzed using the Nvivo 11 Plus
qualitative analysis program.

198

Yin (1994) suggested that researchers consider utilizing one of four methods of
analysis when conducting case studies. These were: pattern matching, explanation
building, time-series analysis and program logic models. Pattern matching occurred
when the researcher compared empirically-based patterns to predicted ones or reverse
patterns in the case study. Explanation building was a process whereby the researcher
developed an initial theory or proposition and compared it with the data collected and
then revised the theory or proposition across cases until the theory fitted the data that was
collected. Time-series analysis was described as being able to examine ‘why’ and ‘how’
questions in the study over a set period of time, while taking note of the changes that had
occurred relating to the phenomenon studied. The program logic models were used in
explanatory and exploratory studies to make cause and effect matches between variables.
Yin (1994) suggested that it was not possible for the researcher to immediately
determine which of the four methods would best analyze the data that was collected in
this case study, but it was probable that one or more of the four methods suggested by for
case study analysis would be used to analyze the data gathered during the study. It was
also possible to create a lay-out of the Methodological Review Plan that was followed
during the study to help with these decisions, as is described in Figure 3.3 below, and
suggested and described in Stake (1994). The researcher adapted Stake (1994)’s
Methodological Review Plan and used it in this study, following the steps listed in Figure
3.4.

Interviews
Denzin (2001) described the interview as “an interpretative practice” where livedmeaning and history were related and it was possible to “write the world bringing it into
play” (p. 25). The interview was also described to be a “miniature and coherent world”
(p. 25) that did not mirror reality instead the interview was like a performance where the
interviewees were placed in the role of storytellers. The “reflexive” (p. 28) interviewer
listened to the many different stories told during interviews and interpreted and analyzed
them.

Wolcott (1999) described how the qualitative ethnographer and researcher
conducted inquires and examinations during the interviewing process and how there
were major distinctions. The researcher’s role could be either as a passive or an active
inquirer or examiner or an intruder initiating activities during the interview amongst
those being studied. The inquirer posed a dilemma by intruding in the interview
process having their own agenda. Often the researcher remained silent hoping that
what they wanted to know (eventually) would be revealed “in some naturally
occurring way” (p. 47) Attempting to discover the truth, the researcher in this study
had to combine both the intruder stance and the silent stance, since it was extremely
difficult to draw information from study participants. As a result, the truth that
emerged was not what the researcher had expected would emerge.
In this case study, the researcher used semi-structured interview techniques with
the participants. The techniques used in the interviews were a two-way conversational
technique, which started out with the researcher attempting to develop a report with the
interviewee and make the interviewee feel comfortable during the interview process. The

201

questions created for the interviews were open-ended, and constructed to encourage topic
elaboration and avoid closed questions with yes-no answers from participants. The semistructured interview started out with general questions and moved into more specific
questions. This type of interviewing procedure was believed to be flexible, because even
though the interviewer had developed a set of questions to ask during the interview, it
was still possible when necessary to deviate from the set of constructed questions and ask
probing questions of the interviewee that would provide further details. Yet it was still
possible to return to the original set of questions and continue to use the set as an
interview guide. The interviewer determined if there were instances where the
transcription was incorrectly transcribed and where the meaning of the participants’
comments had been mis-transcribed or somehow misunderstood (Denzin, 2001).
Wolcott (1997), in describing ethnographic research techniques, divided the
research interview process into four sections, representing four basic research strategies:
participant-observation, interviewing and two augmented sections, the use of written
sources and the analysis or collection of non-written sources, e.g. websites. Wolcott
(1997) identified different types of interviews that were commonly conducted by
qualitative researchers: key informant interviews, life history interviews, structured or
formal interviews, informal interviews, and questionnaires. Based on Wolcott’s (1997)’s
interview types, the researcher conducted twenty-three key informant interviews, with
twenty-two that were informal in structure and one that was in the format of a
questionnaire type interview. Wolcott (1997) also made distinctions among participantobserver styles during interviews and suggested three style that were most common
where the researcher was an active participant, privileged observer or a limited observer.

202

In the case of the twenty-two telephone interviews, the researcher was an active
participant, able to ask questions, rephrase them, move in a different direction during the
interview and probe the interviewee further about a specific topic.
The researcher conducted telephone interviews with all participants using the
speaker-phone option. Since interviews were not conducted in person, the interviewer
was unable to observe interviewees and observation notes could not be made about
interviews. Using the telephone speaker-phone option made it possible for the researcher
to tape each interview in duplicate, making sure that no information was lost while
conducting the interview. Each interview was taped by using an Olympus digital voice
recorder and a mobile phone. Twenty-two interviews were then downloaded onto the
computer into Roxio Creator Pro and translated into mp3 format. The mp3 was then
uploaded into Audacity and transcribed. The twenty-third interview was received via
email in the format of a survey because the participant was unable to participate in a
phone interview and was at a distance. The survey questions were transcribed and dealt
with in the same manner as the previous interviews.

Triangulation
Seale (1999) stated that the idea of triangulation was derived from initial
qualitative methodologist researcher discussions in the 1950’s, around the measurement
of validity, suggesting that the qualitative researcher use many different social research
methods of analysis at once so that “the biases of any one method might be canceled out
by the others” and provided credibility the researcher’s process (p. 473). Wolcott (1997)
reminds the researcher that triangulation “is not to be taken literally as it implies, but as a
reminder of the need to corroborate findings” (p. 216). In the same vane Seale (1999)
203

stated that triangulation moved away from “the idea of convergence on a fixed point” and
accepted “a view of research as revealing multiple constructed realities” (p. 474). Seale
(1999) suggested too that triangulation varied with each research problem because it
aided in deepening the researcher’s understanding of the concepts and issues around the
topic studied because every time they read and re-read participant interviews, their
review of these texts produced new interpretations. The researcher transcribed 23
interviews, re-reading them in order to identify and categorize common ideas and topics
that emerged from interviews during the analysis process.

Data Analysis
According to Tesch (1990), qualitative data analysis is viewed as being “eclectic”
meaning that there was really no correct way the researcher should do interpretive data
analysis. There are many types of data analysis that exist, but Denzin & Lincoln (2000)
stated that often it was actually the framework that was chosen by the researcher that
would dictate or direct the researcher in terms of data analysis. Further “strategies of
inquiry…connect the researcher to specific methods of collecting and analyzing empirical
materials” (p. 25) and provided an apt example by stating that “the case study strategy”
relied “on interviewing, observing and document analysis” (p. 25).
Once the information collection phase of the study was completed, the researcher
used a combination of open coding and axial coding to analyze the study, with open
coding defined as identifying and circling or labeling phrases in the text, and axial coding
defined as creating themes, categories and groupings for the codes and labels in the
transcript. Cresswell (1994) stated “data analysis” required “that the researcher be
comfortable with developing categories and making comparisons and contrasts” (p. 153).
204

It was further suggested that the qualitative researcher engage in several data analysis
techniques, thereby “sorting the information into categories, formatting the information
into a story or picture and actually writing the qualitative text” (p. 153). Cresswell (1994)
also suggested that the researcher start coding data as they finished each transcript,
reducing them to categories and themes to better organize their data, as it was extremely
difficult to analyze mountains of data and finish the research if the researcher became
backed up. As a result, it was important that the qualitative researcher had a plan of
action in place before they started data collection for their systematic data analysis. The
researcher started to do this, but fell behind constantly, and had to resume this procedure
throughout the entire interview procedure. The researcher followed the Methodological
Review Plan described in Figure 3.4
Cresswell (1994) suggested that the researcher learn how to utilize a qualitative
computer software program that could “provide a more efficient system for retrieving and
sorting information” (p.187). For this case study, the researcher utilized the qualitative
analysis program, Nvivo 11 Plus to analyze the data further and make the study and its
findings credible. The set of seven questions were organized in the format of a survey and
entered into Nvivo 11 Plus for auto-coding analysis.
In addition, a word cloud analysis was done of participant transcripts using Nvivo
11 Plus. According to DePaolo & Wilkinson (2014) “a picture is worth a thousand
words,” continues to hold true even in the ability to organize any data…in a graphical
representation” so that it “makes the data easy-to-read and comprehend. The
effectiveness of the word cloud is theoretically grounded in the learning model of
graphical organizers”, where “a graphic organizer is a visual communication tool that

205

uses visual symbols to express ideas and concepts, to convey meaning” allowing the
viewer to discover their own patterns of relationships” that “have meaning” (p.38) and
can aid the researcher to better understand the big picture, namely the interrelationships
between individual concepts described in the word cloud.
The word clouds were used in this study to compare and qualitatively analyze the
eight institutions in the study to discover patterns and relationships that were not apparent
when the participant interviews were analyzed. The word clouds were created in Nvivo
11 Plus representing Question 1’s five question survey responses from the 23 participant
transcriptions and eight universities in the study. The limits set were the word cloud
default limits in Nvivo 11 Plus, which were a word frequency of 1,000 and a minimum
word length of three letters.
Participant Confidentiality Concerns

Interviewees participating in this study were very concerned about confidentiality.
The researcher is responsible for protecting the confidentiality of participants since it
would be easy to know which librarians specifically were interviewed at which
university, were more details to be provided about each subject interviewed. As a result,
only job titles have been provided; however, since even providing those titles can very
transparent, and specific responses have not been linked to titles. To protect librarian
confidentiality, the researcher has not used a number in the study to describe each
librarian and has not been specific about which librarian said what at which university
when using the transcription.

206

Participant Debriefing
According to Lincoln & Guba (1985), debriefing was defined as “a process of
exposing oneself to a disinterested peer in a manner paralleling an analytical sessions and
for the purpose of exploring aspects of the inquiry that might otherwise remain only
implicit within the inquirer's mind" (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 308). Even though Lincoln
& Guba (1985) were discussing peer-debriefing which often was possible when more
than one researcher was conducting the interviewing; this explanation pointed out to the
sole researcher, that debriefing was not only for the good of the participant but also for
that of the researcher. Through debriefing the researcher was be able to probe into and
analyze their own biases, test the plausibility of their theories and was better able to
understand their own posture toward the data they had collected during their study.
Cooper & Schindler (2014) defined the debriefing of participants as an event that
occurs after the collection of data and then again after the study had been completed.
During the debriefing after data collection, the researcher shared several ethical truths
with the participants in the study. These ethical truths included: explaining any deception
that occurred in the study or identifying any problems during the study, and providing
participants with the theoretical framework of the study, along with its goals, objectives
and purpose. There was no deception or specific problems that warranted revelation to
study participants related to this study.
Before or after the interviews, there was a debriefing time when participants were
provided with information about the interviews, why they were being conducted and
what the process would be following the interview. Participants were told that if they had
any questions at all they could ask at any time after the interviews had been conducted.

207

Participants asked that they not be named and the interviewer did her best to protect their
identities and institutional connections. Thus, interviewers were not named using initials
and limited direct connections were made between participants and their colleges.
However, each college’s unique program information and procedures relating to how
information literacy was taught was triangulated.
Cooper & Shindler (2014) stated that during the debriefing at the completion of
the study, the researcher was required to share the results of the study with all study
participants. In this study, each of the participants was debriefed twice, once where they
were provided with all the information about the study and were encouraged to ask
additional questions and then again after they were interviewed. Each participant was
provided with a study findings report in the form a dissertation link.
This debriefing was done before or after the interview so that the participants
would better understand the research study. They were encouraged to contact their
colleagues if they believed that there were others who might be able to help with the
researcher’s study or that had not been included. Each initial contact was able to get back
to the researcher with additional participant names. Participants were provided with
instruction to make sure that if they needed clarification or had specific questions about
the study and did not ask them before they would have the opportunity to do so at any
time by contacting the researcher. The final debriefing happened at the end of the study
when the participants received a final report from the researcher describing the results of
the study.

208

Trustworthiness

Lincoln & Guba (1985, 1989) described trustworthiness in qualitative research as
a ‘science’ delineating six criteria in relation to trustworthiness: credibility,
transferability, dependability, fidelity, authenticity and confirmability as measures of
trustworthiness. Trustworthiness is embedded within qualitative narrative methodology,
the systematic analysis of the narrative through thematic coding and research question
categorization and critical story analysis that engages the researcher in reflection and a
retelling of the story around and within the power structures that emerge (Moss, 2004).
Shelton (2003) stated that the works of Guba & Lincoln explained that there were four
concepts that researchers had to pursue to develop a trustworthy study and that these
could in turn be connected to the quantitative to better explain them and make them
easier to comprehend: credibility (to internal validity); transferability (to external
validity/generalizability); dependability (to reliability) and confirmability (to objectivity).
Authenticity
Authenticity was defined by Guba & Lincoln (1994) by describing this concept as
four different but related authenticities, “ontological authenticity” which enlarged
“personal constructions,” “educative authenticity” which led “to an improved
understanding of others,” catalytic authenticity which stimulated action and “tactical
authenticity” which empowered action (p.114). Whittemore, Chase & Mandle (2001)
stated that authenticity was closely linked to credibility in validity. This was because it
portrayed research by reflecting meaning and experience that had been lived and
perceived by participants and provided a “multivocality of interpretative perspectives.”

209

The “authenticity of the person, phenomenon, or situation” that was an “important criteria
for validity” (p. 530). Authenticity was about being able to “remain true to the
phenomenon” (p. 530) that was being studied, where the researcher was then able to
speak to the authenticity of the experience of their participants that they had interviewed.
The researcher was required to pay “conscious” attention to not influencing what their
participants had to say. It was further suggested that multiple socially constructed
realities were “exposed through attention to authenticity” in a study (p. 530).

Credibility
Shenton (2004) defined credibility in terms of internal validity, where the
researcher seeks to determine if the study measures or tests what it intends. “Credibility,

deals with the question, “How congruent are the findings with reality?” since Lincoln
& Guba argue that ensuring credibility is one of most important factors in establishing
trustworthiness” (Shelton, 2004, p. 64). Qualitatively, this translated into determining
how well participants answered the questions that were asked during the interview. Also
how well the researcher followed the qualitative research process, whether the researcher
adopted acceptable qualitative interviewing techniques and whether methods used
involving triangulating a wide range of information sources was used. Confirmability
Shelton (2004) described confirmability as a construct that developed out of the
Guba’s (1981) writings about objectivity that were emerging and still being defined by
qualitative researchers today. According to Shelton (1994), confirmability was the
researcher’s concern to be objective. In also related to the steps had to be taken by the
qualitative researcher to make sure that their findings resulted from the experiences and

210

ideas of the participants in their study and that these were not directly related to the
“characteristics and preferences of the researcher” (p. 72). It was therefore suggested that
the researcher admit to their own predispositions, technique weaknesses, “beliefs
underpinning decisions made and methods adopted” and “preliminary theories not bourne
out by the data” (p. 72) and that these were reported and discussed in their study. It was
considered important make sure that a study was considered confirmable, if the
researcher could trace the course of their research step-by-step through decision and
process, following a “data-orientated approach” that showed how their “data” had
eventually led them to “the formation of recommendations” (p. 72).

Transferability and Generalization
External validity was defined by Yin (2009) as “defining the domain to which a
study’s findings” were “generalized” (p. 40). Shenton (2004) pointed out that
generalization and transferability are really concerned with the extent to which “the
findings of one study could be applied to other situations” (p. 69). To prove
transferability (external validity), the researcher had to use the data gathered and
analyzed in multiple case studies to identify similarities and differences between cases
and to develop a probable theory that would then be developed connecting the cases with
one another. In relation to generalization, it was understood that unlike with quantitative
research studies where there were statistical generalizations, instead, there were analytical
generalizations, and it was not uncommon for the results from multiple case studies to be
generalized and applied to a broad theory. Yin (2009) reminded researchers that
generalizations in case studies were never automatic and that “a theory” had “to be tested

211

by replicating the findings in a second or even third” (p. 44) case and if the same results
are obtained, then the theory was able to hold up as a valid theory.

Fidelity
Blumenfield-Jones (1995) defined fidelity as the act of faithfulness and integrity
on the part of the researcher to preserve “the worth and dignity of the teller” (p. 27). This
also means that each story told by a participant can be considered to be unique, standing
apart from other stories told about their institution. Thus, if three interviews were
conducted relating to the same institutional program and the information that can be
gathered from each of these transcriptions is reliable, and dependable, then each story is
authentic and has its own worth, thus adding to the entire institutional story.
Dependability
Shenton (2004) described dependability in the same way that reliability in the
positivist sense was described. If a study were repeated using the same methods and
contexts, would the study results be the same? Shenton (2004) does point out that the
concept of “reliability” is problematic in qualitative research situations because what the
qualitative researcher observes, determines, finds is attached directly to situation and is
therefore “frozen in the ethnographic present” (p. 71). Thus, dependability is concerned
with how the qualitative study was designed and how the research design was
implemented, how the data was gathered during the study and how effective the inquiry
process during the study really was.

212

Ethical Considerations
Farquhar (2012) addressed seven ethical responsibilities that researchers had to be
sure of when they undertook the research process. Farquhar (2012) stated that it was the
researcher’s responsibility to be properly trained to work with human subjects during the
study and to conduct their qualitative study following acceptable and correct qualitative
methodologies, procedures and analyses. The researcher had to prevent plagiarism, avoid
conflicts of interest, and take the necessary preventative measures to protect all subjects
participating in the study from physical or psychological harm. It was also the
researcher’s responsibility to conduct the research study ethically, with integrity, and
under the effective management of the research institution.
The researcher completed the Kansas State University IRB training (Appendix A)
necessary to work with human subjects. The researcher made sure that each participant
voluntarily participated in the study reading the consent forms, asking questions about the
study and signing a participant letter of consent form (Appendix B) before the study
commenced. Participants were notified that they could choose not to answer a question
during the interviews or withdraw from the study at any time. If there were problems with
the data, the researcher did what was necessary to correct these problems and re-code the
data.

Coding the Reasoning Process

Renowned Oxford University qualitative researcher, Johnny Saldana states that a
“code is a word or short phrase that symbolically assigns a summative, salient, essence
capturing, and/or evocative at tribute for a portion of language-based or visual data”
213

(Saldana, 2008, p. 4). According to Merriam (1998) how we interpret our themes by
looking at the patterns described and ultimately “our analysis” and “interpretation – our
study’s findings will reflect the constructs, concepts, language, models, and theories that
structured the study in the first place” (p. 48). Thus, the researcher used an open-ended
process and started out using “first impression” coding. These codes developed into
“thematic” codes that were directly related to topical themes associated with instruction,
assessment, curriculum and instruction and information literacy. Single words, phrases
and sentences were coded and each coded section was considered to be a “unit.” Coded
interview comments that had the same theme in this dissertation were counted, so that
patterns could be studied closely and the three dissertation questions could be answered
using the themes and the patterns that emerged. Saldanha (2008) suggested that there
were six types of patterns that existed and had to be considered by the researcher when
they were coding qualitative research e.g. transcripts, and these were: “similarity (things
happen the same way), difference (they happen in predictably different ways), frequency
(they happen often or seldom), sequence (they happen in a certain order), correspondence
(they happen in relation to other activities or events) and causation (one appears to cause
another)” (p.6). The researcher explains in detail in Chapter 4, the transcript coding
process and what went into coding and transcript analysis.

Chapter Summary

In this chapter, the research questions posed in this study were stated, and
followed by the role of the researcher in the study, the rationale for qualitative research,
the multiple case study rationale, the description of research settings, the research
214

locations and programs, a description of the expert panel, participant program selection,
sampling procedures and document analysis. Also described were a multiple case study
approach to data and collection methods. Further qualitative data collection and analysis
were detailed. This section was followed by a discussion about the trustworthiness of the
study, which included topics such as authenticity, credibility, transferability, fidelity,
dependability, the ethical considerations that the researcher takes into account when
conducting the study and the reasoning that was associated with the coding that the
researcher did in the study.

Chapter 4 - Findings

Chapter Overview

This chapter includes an introduction, the study questions are restated, an
interview data collection section that described the interview process in depth, and a
demographics section that described the demographics of the study participants and their
colleges/universities. There are also three sections describing the major findings for
questions 1-3, a discussion about these qualitative findings and a chapter summary.

Introduction

An application to approve this study was made to the Kansas State University
Institutional Review Board (IRB) in August, 2015. Approval for the study to commence
was received in November 2015. The questions for the researcher’s study was vetted in
December and three months were set aside, from January through March 2016, to
conduct the interviews for the study, with data analysis following the data collection
process.
Cresswell (2007) stated that qualitative research was “a set of interpretative,
material practices that make the world visible” (p.36). As the qualitative study was
implemented, and the research process unfolded, the researcher’s world view and
assumptions were tried and expanded, clashing with those of the various participants in
the study who provided answers to the interview questions posed. Those answers were

216

compared to one another, analyzed and then put through the theoretical lenses available
from the field of education and interpreted to answer the overall research questions posed
in the study (Cresswell, 2007, p.37).
The questions posed to participants in interviews were based on and associated
with the three major research questions relating to the development of information
literacy courses in exemplary colleges and universities in the United States which were as
follows:
1. How are exemplary four-year colleges implementing exemplary information
literacy courses?
2. How do exemplary four-year college library information literacy courses
implement the Association of College and Research Libraries Information
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000), and the
American College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016)?
3. To what extent is digital literacy incorporated into these exemplary
information literacy courses?

Interview Data Collection and Participant Selection

The researcher contacted key four-year exemplary institutions via email that were
listed on the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Best
Practices: Exemplary Programs website. Two of the colleges did not respond to emails
or telephone call requests to participate in the study. A third college stated that they were

217

not able to participate in the study. Eight colleges were willing to participate and initial
contacts were asked to identify the instruction coordinator or the library director
responsible for the information literacy program at their institutions. Once these were
received, the researcher contacted each program by telephone and established an
interview date and time. Once the interview was completed, the researcher asked for two
more names of contacts from each institution that might be available for an interview.
Interview participants were asked that any suggested participants be notified that they
would be contacted in the near future. Once those names were secured the suggested
participants were then contacted by telephone or via email for interview dates and times
to be established. In order to keep a record of study participants, an online spreadsheet
was developed in Microsoft Excel. The record identified each participant, assigned
numbers used to identify each uniquely, and the institutions they were related to. The
Excel spreadsheet was also used to keep appointment dates and times straight since
interview appointments often had to be rescheduled. The researcher created an Excel
spreadsheet and named it an Interview Task Chart that was continually updated and can
be found in Table 4.1. Prior to the interview date, each participant was contacted via
email and the interview protocol that included interview questions and the letter of
informed consent that required a signature was sent to them. Participants were asked to
read the forms, ask any questions and sign them prior to the interview. They were advised
that if they had any additional questions, they could ask them at any time during the
study.

218

Twenty-three participants were interviewed during the study. Interviews took the
form of taped telephone interviews. They took place during a short window of time
between December 11th, 2015 and February 12th, 2016.
The interview protocol was lengthy since the three major research questions were
expanded to include a total of nineteen open-ended questions that were asked of
participants, described in Table 4.1. The protocol was used as a question guide, so that in
each interview the same questions were asked, but often the expansions on the questions
were different and sometimes unique depending on the specialty of the instruction
librarian or how the librarian was working with instruction and information literacy at
their institution. When topics were discussed that the researcher wanted more information
about, questions were asked that were not in the research protocol, in order to probe and
explore additional areas that added value to the information literacy topics discussed.
Twenty-two participants in the study were interviewed using the twelve questions
as an interview guide. One participant, who had a disability, requested that the interview
questions be emailed so that it could be filled out as a questionnaire, which consisted of
all the questions in the protocol sent via email to the participant. The participant then
responded by typing the answers to the questions and sending them back to the researcher
via email. When the questionnaire was returned to the researcher, all the questions were
answered except for the final question which was not completed because the participant
believed that the question was missing the point, and that there was much more to
information literacy instruction when teaching Authority is constructed and contextual
than just teaching students how to use technology. Thus, the question was asked:

219

“Please relate student technology use to information literacy course/program outcomes
to the six frames: Authority is constructed and contextual.”
The answer provided by the participant was:
“Information Creation as a process, Information has value, Research as Inquiry,
Scholarship as Conversation, Searching as Strategic Exploration, Research is Inquiry
Sorry, I cannot complete this question. It just doesn’t make sense to me. Technology is a
tool that is used to employ information, but it is not the crux of the matter. “
The questionnaire was Table 4.1 typed up as an email, was included with the
interviews and was not treated separately from the interviews, but was coded
similarly. The protocol questions were used in the interviews with all the
participants and can be found in Table 4.1

In order to make the lengthy interview responses easier to manage, data analysis
was done in NVIVO 11 Plus.
After each interview was transcribed, the transcription was coded so that the
answers from each transcription were added to a separate survey worksheet containing
each of the seven questions ready for input into NVIVO in a survey format. Each file was
organized using Microsoft Word headings. In the transcript “I” for Interviewer and “S”
for Subject were used. Each of the seven questions were written in the survey using
heading 1/chapter formatting, the subject or “S’s” answers to questions using normal
formatting and all “I’s” answers using italics formatting in the survey. Each survey file
was named for the institution and participant and entered in NVIVO 11 for auto-coding
analysis. An example of one of the survey questions as it was formatted in Microsoft
Word and entered into NVIVO 11, is presented below in Figure 4.1.

Participant Demographics

Of the twenty-three participates that were interviewed during this qualitative
study, 19 participants (82.6%) were female and four participants (17.4%) were male.
When examining participants’ academic titles, three participants held a position of either
dean, director, or associate director of the academic library, six held instruction head or
coordinator positions and fourteen held instruction librarian position that included faculty
rank. All the male librarians interviewed were instruction librarians, but all had also
attained additional administrative standings in their library community.

In Table 4.3 the Question 1: Eight Main Themes that were determined during the
interviews are listed above. This table is a summary of the major themes discovered when
analyzing interview data. A total of 1,286 interview comments was coded from
instruction librarian interviews conducted during the study. A total of 396 interview
comments was coded from interviews to the major “General Education Program” theme
under which all the libraries’ information literacy courses were organized. Three more
major themes were directly related to the general education program were identified, with
the most prominent total numbers of coded interview comments which were: 174
interview comments related to “Strategic Planning,” 151 interview comments related to
“Administration,” and 144 interview comments related to “Assessment.” The “Best
Practices in Information Literacy” theme had 108 total interview comments coded to it
which included six themes. The “Assessment” theme had 144 interview comments coded
to it. The “Information Literate Student” theme that was related to all the previous themes
had 104 interview comments coded to it that included twelve sub-themes. “The
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000)” theme had one subtheme, and a total of 14 interview comments coded to it. “The Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)”
theme had 27 interview comments coded to it, 25 to the main theme and three to the subtheme. In-depth sectional descriptions of themes and sub-themes answering Question 1
will follow this summary.
Theme: The General Education Program
In relation to the information literacy models that were described in Chapter 2, the
researcher developed diagrammatic representations to explain how course program
227

similarities and differences between large and smaller institutions in the study were
perceived, Figure 4.4. The diagram was inspired by an @Randall Library Poster
(University of North Carolina, Wilmington, 2016) developed by one of the libraries in the
study to explain the four step Information Literacy Process to new students who were to
take information literacy courses at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. The
poster is located in Appendix N. The diagram explains that freshman took courses at their
institutions according to interviewees across all eight institutions either as a seminar or a
core writing class or a general education course. At the two smallest colleges in this study
with student population’s smaller than 10,000 information literacy was integrated into
writing courses and organized and taught as sequenced courses. At the six larger
universities, the one-shot, course integration and embedded methods of teaching
information literacy were emphasized as course offerings. Smaller colleges, because of
the smaller size of their student body, had more opportunity to teach for-credit
information literacy courses that were compulsory or served as a pre-requisite in a major,
but this was also being done by larger institutions focused on improving 1-1 student
information literacy teaching opportunities, with upper-level classes. For-credit courses
were where instructors had direct contact with students. Where they could teach a range
of information literacy topics and have informative discussions with students. Where
authentic learning could take place and where instructors were able to get to know
student personally along with their strengths and weaknesses in the classroom. As a
result, there would be greater opportunities for students to become information literate
than if they were working with instructions in a one-shot session.

228

Figure 4.4
Diagrammatic Format of Information Literacy Programs in Studied Institutions

Note: This diagram was developed by the researcher to describe how information
literacy courses/programs were organized at the eight universities in the study.

Figure 4.5 describes in diagrammatic format, how a course development process
might occur, using ten possible steps, starting from librarian-faculty-administrator
collaboration. This would be where the library director and librarians might start talking
with faculty and administrators about what information literacy is and why they think that
information literacy should be taught at the institution. To a librarians or faculty members
acquiring a seat on behalf of the library on a general education program committee would
be important as and these faculty would work to make sure that the library’s strategic

229

plan is in-line with the university’s and that subject-faculty needs would be met when
teaching subject-specific information literacy.
Figure 4.5
Perception of University Information Literacy Course Process

Note: This figure was developed by the researcher to describe the ten steps of the
information literacy course development process.
From there librarians would work with the committee to create course outcomes
and determine what course models will be used that will best fit the university and the
general education program or discipline. Librarians will have the opportunity to train
faculty and librarians about information literacy and work with them to determine what
programs might be tagged, or decide which courses will have information literacy
230

integration in them. Librarians and faculty collaboratively created courses, and if
necessary also sequenced the information literacy courses. Librarians will work with
faculty teaching general education courses and writing courses for integrations to be
developed and subject-liaisons will work with faculty and departments to determine how
information literacy will be integrated into specific courses in the disciplines. Methods of
assessment will be determined prior to offering any courses. Once courses are taught,
they will be evaluated and assessments will be completed, following what was decided.
Decisions will have been made about when assessments will occur and who will be
responsible for creating them, or presenting them to students and analyzing them.
Evaluation and assessments reports will provide instructors with information about how
the information literacy courses will be improved or changed so that future students
would be provided with the better instruction.
The library’s involvement in the general education program in the institutions in
the study were said to have started out with the development of a new general education
program or the redevelopment of the same, and opportunities for program development
that were offered to library administrators to take, as one librarian explained it:
“When the college implemented its current general education program and when
it was actually designing its current general education program because the
Library really saw that as an opportunity to get more involved and you know we
just really started or the folks that were there really started pushing hard and
jumping at every opportunity that they could get to part of this conversation.”
Librarians defined the general education program at their institutions as:
“The General Education Program for the university is the required

231

courses that the all the students need to take to meet the graduation
requirements…and what the instructional services have done …They have been
working with the faculty for many years, they established a lot of relationships
with a lot of faculty members who are involved in general education and they
have worked together…”
Librarians in the study also emphasized the importance for the library and also for
information literacy course development of librarian and library administrator
involvement in serving on general education program committees. Librarian service on
general education committees allowed them to emphasize the necessity of information
literacy programs and integration into current general education programming at the
university:
“the committee has been mandated, they recently revised all the requirements and
they’re gonna be implementing the new general education program…he’s chair of
the committee that’s actually in charge of that, so it’s quite a bit of work. This
time around with the revisions to the general education program there are eleven
outcomes and one of the things that…did was to get established that one of those
eleven outcomes would be information literacy and with this new program…all
the general education courses have to meet at least two outcomes, one preferably
two, and all the general education courses that we had under the old program
plus any new courses, have to be submitted and approved to show that they meet
the new program’s outcomes and of course one of them is information literacy.”
The researcher found that the information literacy programs of each institution in the
study were developed for all students within the confines of each institution’s general

232

education program. For students in the majors, information literacy was integrated into
their upper level courses and taught by an instruction librarian who was also a subject
liaison. Each college’s general education program was unique and offered information
literacy courses of different course lengths depending on the college. At the same time
each institution emphasized the student’s Liberal Arts requirements that had to be
completed prior to graduation. One librarian explained their general education program
and how it worked:
“…this first year experience course that we work with is called GEL, which is called
General Education Lifelong learning. These GEL courses have a two-week module, for
lack of better term, where librarians teach those two weeks it’s six hours I think total.
And that is, because of an Area E course it has the…board of information literacy and
we’ve written those learning outcomes. In terms of how the mission drives what we’re
doing, so the social justice piece is an interesting one because that comes out in two
different ways. It could be formal learning outcomes where students are learning that the
power structures inherent with information creation.”

The researcher found that information literacy classes and the format were delivered
could be directly aligned to course outcomes and also to the size of the institution. Larger
institutions with more sections of information literacy courses commonly offered oneshots and tutorials connected to the flipped classroom model, or followed the embedded
librarian model. Smaller institutions offered their students more sequenced, for-credit
information literacy courses because librarians had smaller class sections of students and
more time to teach sequenced sections of information literacy compared with the larger
institutions. As one librarian explained:

233

“It’s just that the first year sequence,… or just the version of it that is called
LSFY which is what the majority of the students take… has a skills matrix, which
includes writing, oral communication, reading and information literacy that all
faculty who teach in the sequence teach to and so in that sense if you teaching one
of those three classes in the sequence, because we’re on three ten week terms, so
if you teach one of those three classes, you will doing information literacy and
you will be working with a librarian on that because it’s part of that structure of
the curriculum.”
Larger institutions with more librarians on their staff still had staffing limitations because
of the size of their student body. Typically offerings were one-shot information literacy
courses because library instructors assigned to these one-shots (Davis et al., 2011) were
teaching hundreds of sections of information literacy courses. Information literacy
courses generally took the format of face-to-face and blended courses where courses were
designed to include online-components that made it easier for students to interact with the
information literacy course material. Larger universities in the study offered many
sections of information literacy courses for their freshman that included modules or
tutorials that students had to complete before, during or after visiting the university
library:
“So there’s 73 sections and 73 modules you know in Blackboard. And there’s five
modules and it takes about five hours for them to complete and they get a grade
on it.”
Institutions using one-shots in the study often stated that they used the flipped classroom
model (Horn, 2013) with their freshmen classes, since the library had invested in creating

234

interactive tutorials on information literacy topics. Students were required to complete
these online before coming to their first library visit, where they were then graded by the
librarians. As one librarian explained about using the learning management system for
their tutorials:
“…now there’s are a number of professors that are doing classes more like
flipped instruction for their classes so that they’re preparing for classes ahead of
time, we work with them we don’t have Blackboard we use Moodle and so things
get put in there.”
Institutions developing information literacy programs built them in their general
education programs around both their institutional and library strategic plans:
“We do meet the library’s its part of our strategic plan but because we are, we’re
part of the general education program so it’s definitely very closely related to the
university’s outcomes and their strategic plan and because the whole general
education program was completely, it’s been completely revamped, to meet the
mission and the strategic plan, to bring the you know make the students be critical
thinkers and its more than just information literacy, this is this is across the whole
curriculum and so it’s very closely related to the rest of the university’s mission
and the strategic plan and obviously because we are involved with general
education we are an active part of a central core of the university’s curriculum.”
If an information literacy program is included in the university’s strategic plan, then the
program was inadvertently vetted (supported) by administration and the faculty and
would have a better chance at success.

Theme: Strategic Planning
The “Strategic Planning” Theme and Sub-Themes were described in Table 4.4.
The “Strategic Planning” theme had a total of 174 interview comments coded to it. The
“Strategic Planning” theme had two sub-themes “Mission” and “Outcomes.” “Mission”
had 20 interview comments coded to it and “Outcomes” had 56 interview comments
coded to it.

The findings were that the academic libraries in the study had their own internal
strategic plans, but that the library strategic plan was always tied back to the strategic

236

plan of their institution. The libraries in the study also had their own mission statements,
but these were also connected back directly to that of the institution.
“Yes so our strategic plan we have a couple of strategic directions and I can
read them to you if that would be helpful? One of the strategic directions that
drives our program, “the library will lead in exploring and assessing programs
that ensure and enhance student learning and success”. The other one um oh,
that’s the one with strategic direction. Our mission includes “to collaborate with
university’s community to ensure that user-centered experiences, welcoming
environments and accessible information resources in order to facilitate scholarly
inquiry and prepare students to be critical thinkers who are engagement members
of local, regional and global communities” and that that does very clearly state
what we’re doing.”
It was also found that library strategic plans were often created to include the
requirements of the college accrediting body. The library upheld important competencies,
such as information literacy, that were proposed as best practices in area institutions:
“We’re accredited by WASC Western Association of Schools and Colleges and
one of the five core competencies that WASC looks for when they do accreditation
is information literacy and so that’s been really good in that it was adopted
university-wide in accreditation body and so of course its included in the library
strategic plan.”
Study findings indicated further that when librarians made their plans to create an
information literacy course they started with their institution and their library’s strategic
planning documents. More specifically, they started with their institutional and library

237

mission statements that were then used as a guide for how to start the course outcomes
and course building process. As one librarian explained the process:
“They focus on the institutional mission, when they plan, when we plan
strategically, but also when we’ve planned specifically about information literacy
so in our case, the institution’s strategic planning document refers to learning,
discovery, research and engagement and so learning of course lines up closely
with information literacy and then there are many other documents that we would
point to as guiding policy documents.”
It was also found that when the library’s strategic plan was developed from the library’s
mission and vision that were most often in-line with that of the parent institution. When
goals and objectives were written that would guide library programming such as an
information literacy program, the goals and objective used were also in alignment. As on
librarian went on to explain:
“Our vision statement and mission statement are very much in line with what the
college is asking for in those two things and so we have our goals, objectives and
short-term outcomes are divided into six areas: teaching, service, outreach,
collections, sustainability and space.”
Librarians stated that they often worked as a team on writing or rewriting mission
statements after revising courses or crafting new mission statements for information
literacy classes:
“So we are actually rewriting our mission right now. We are getting input from
the rest of the department to make sure it is still with the new framework and a lot

238

of changes we have undergone and just making sure that everyone's up for our
overall mission.”
Often the library or library system’s mission was shared with that of the university and
the shared mission was then used when information literacy course outcomes were being
written:
“We were recognized for articulating a clear mission. We have a set of shared
values and shared learning outcomes that are connect to the library and the
university and to life- long learning. So we were recognized for our mission also
for our goals and objectives our instruction framework that was developed locally
has a road map and tools for developing the university library’s instruction
efforts.”
Information literacy course student learning outcome creation was found to be central to
the development of information literacy course and program. These outcomes were often
created in collaboration with the faculty and were often only just one of several general
education undergraduate learning outcomes that were adapted, adopted and approved by
general education committees across campuses. As one instruction librarian explained:
“We have information literacy as one of our nine college-wide learning
Outcomes and when that happened. It wasn’t that long ago actually that the
college-wide learning outcomes were approved by the faculty.”
Librarians clarified they constantly revised their library strategic plans, and that these
were often on a set revision cycle e.g, a two-year cycle. They also emphasized that there
were differences that existed between both the university and the library strategic plan
goals and the learning outcomes that were used for their information literacy courses

239

were not the same. There was a definite connection between strategic goals and ultimate
course outcomes:
“So we’ve just finished up the 2013 to the 2015 plan and that’s closely aligned
with the university’s plan. And our instruction program is meant has some goals
within the strategic plan every two years that we we’re working towards and
those are different from our learning outcomes in some ways because our
strategic plan includes goals like you know having more faculty engage with us
on assignment design or working with more graduate students to design research
assignments that kind of thing, which is um different from our learning outcomes
which are student learning focused, you know that students will be able to
evaluate information effectively,”
In describing the library strategic plan, why it was important, and why it was really about
connecting the library with the administration, the faculty and the students at an
institution, a librarian explained:
“The strategic plan is at the library level so the libraries as a whole function kind
of like a college and we have our own strategic plan that we pursue… as faculty
and staff.”
Theme: Administration
The “Administration” Theme and Sub-Themes were listed in Table 4.5. A total of
319 interview comments were coded from interviews to the major “Administration”
theme that had nine unique interview comments coded to it had two sub-themes,
“Faculty” and “Librarians as Teachers.” The “Faculty” sub-theme had three subsidiary
themes and a total of 137 interview comments coded to it. Forty-five interview
240

comments were coded to the “Faculty” sub-theme and 20 interview comments were
coded to it the “Student Learning” sub-theme, 23 interview comments were coded to the
“Rubrics” sub-theme and 49 interview comments were coded to the “Assignments” subtheme.

The “Librarians as Teachers” sub-theme had six subsidiary themes and a total of
77 interview comments coded to it. Twenty interview comments were coded to
“Librarians as teachers” sub-theme, the “Collaboration” subsidiary theme had 12
interview comments coded it, the “Liaison Program” subsidiary theme had 18 interview
comments coded to it, the “Professional Development” subsidiary theme had 11
interview comments coded to it, the “Reference Desk” subsidiary theme had 11 interview
comments coded to it and the “Researcher” subsidiary theme had five interview
comments coded to it. The themes with the most prominent interview comments in the
“Administration” were the “Faculty” and the “Liaison Program” themes. The findings
suggested that information literacy programs in institutions were most successful when
the library’s program was supported by the institution’s administration, as one librarian
pointed out:
“The administration is very supportive of information literacy and promotes
information literacy actively themselves.”
And another emphasized with gusto:
“We have the support and we have the resources. Their support is that we have
cheerleaders who go around campus and talk about how awesome we are; you
know and that is such a wonderful thing to have, to not be at odds with your
administrators.”
Study findings strongly suggested further that successful information literacy course and
program implementation, in fact, all eight institutions agreed this was a critical
component, were dependent on the collaborative arrangements made between the
instructional librarians and the faculty.
242

“The extent of participation of faculty in information literacy and the kind of
work that we’re been able to do with them to you know to really carefully design
ways for students to become more information literate.”
The instruction librarians also worked with the faculty to integrate information literacy
into their courses. If the faculty wanted librarians to participate as an embedded librarian
in an online course, they worked directly with the faculty. Likewise, if outcomes had not
yet been created in relation to information literacy or if library resources were needed in
order to develop the information literacy portions of the course, librarians worked
collaboratively on faculty request. As an instruction librarian explained further:
“So we can share the work that we’re doing and also we can recommend certain
materials to faculty who, because of how their core is, they are sort of on their
own when it comes to the more upper division information literacy requirements
um and so we are in a position where we are sort of information literacy
consultants to faculty for who it’s been our charge to integrate it into their course
and we can tell them, like we can share assignments on how to do that, you know,
we can do that kind of thing, so it actually puts us, you know in a different
position so that instead of being the actual people who are teaching it we’re also
consulting others who teach it.”
In all the institutions the instruction librarians were hired not only to instruct information
literacy classes but also to serve as subject liaison librarians to one or more divisions or
departments within the institution. It was the liaison librarian’s job to connect the library
and the subject division or department and also as a liaison between the division and it’s
students in relation to the library. The liaison librarian was also responsible for

243

developing subject-specific library collections and teaching students how to use the
databases and resources that were related to the subject. As a library liaison librarian
explained further:
“I’m also liaison to several academic departments in my case its Communication
Studies, Film Studies…Psychology, Oral Languages and Cultures and
International Studies. So that means I do consultations for those students and the
professors. I also do collection development as far as purchasing materials on
DVD’s and things like that and I also do instruction to those departments. And the
other part of it kind of dovetailing with University Studies [General Education
Program] is that each of the academic departments are required to have classes,
they have information literacy as an outcome, so part of those course
requirements is that they we try to have this kind of contact between the library
and those courses consistently throughout the rotation of the classes.”
Librarians in the study explained that liaison librarians were subject specialists teaching
for several college divisions and completing information literacy assessments for these
divisions as well. So when instruction librarians served as liaison librarians at their
colleges they were hired to work worked in “their specialty” areas and they knew
“How to help students and faculty in research for that particular division and
then also they ordered “ books for that division” and “they” made themselves
experts on the databases that tend to be used heavily by that division and they
also” taught and assessed “the classes for that division.”

Theme: Best Practices in Information Literacy
The “Best Practices” Theme and Sub-Themes are listed in Table 4.6. The
transcriptions that were analyzed can be found in Appendix K. Six themes were identified
when analyzing the best practices question: “How did you use best practices in
developing your information literacy program?” These six themes were best practices
applications in the information literacy programs at the institutions studied in: Reference,
Information Literacy Curriculum, Information Literacy Models, Curriculum and Program
Administration, Information Literacy Assessment and No Information Literacy Best
Practices. The “Reference” theme had five sub-themes, the Information Literacy
Curriculum had ten sub-themes, the Information Literacy Models theme had three subthemes, the Curriculum and Program Administration had six sub-themes, the Information
Literacy Assessment theme had three themes and the No Information Literacy Best
Practices theme had no sub-themes. One hundred and eight interview comments were
coded to this theme. The six themes associated with the “Best Practices in Information
Literacy” theme were “Reference” to which 17 interview comments were coded to it,
“Information Literacy Curriculum” to which 38 interview comments were coded,
“Information Literacy Models” to which 8 interview comments were coded, “Curriculum
and Program Administration” to which 25 interview comments were coded, “Information
Literacy Assessment” to which six interview comments were coded and “No Information
Literacy Best Practices” to which two interview comments were coded. To explain the
importance of this question to participants in this study, it is necessary to define what best
practices are. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary (2016) defined best practices as “a
procedure that has been shown by research and experience to produce optimal
results and that is established or proposed as a standard suitable for widespread
245

adoption.” According to Hunt & Birks (2004) in an article describing the ACRL
Characteristics of Programs of Information Literacy that Illustrate Best Practices: A
Guideline, “best practices” is defined as “standards” that “describe goals and objectives
that are closely in-tune with those of individual programs, departments, and the
institution as a whole and explain the need for close collaboration between the library and
discipline-based faculty in planning and teaching” (p.27). The instruction librarians in
this study developed the information literacy programs at their institutions
around the best practices that were prevalent in the fields of education and
librarianship. There-by building programs that followed acceptable referencework and teaching practices, models and methods that would allow for the
effective development, design, implementation and assessment of these
information literacy courses and programs into the general education programs,
majors and disciplines at their institutions.

There were also participants in the study who did not believe that best practices
(See Appendix M) were what librarians should be following and applying on a daily basis
as they planned their classroom interactions with their students. Instead, it was believed
that best practices could become stifling in practice. As one librarian explained;
“I’m not a big fan of best practice and the reason why is because it can often
stifle innovation…I have worked with people in the past who hang their hats on
best practices so much that they don’t allow for innovation.”
The researcher believes that in order to be innovative, it is important to
read and understand the current research, as innovation and change c an often
sprout out of the seeds sown by the research.
Based on interview data analysis of this study, the six most noted best
practices applied by information literacy programs across the eight institutions
studied were: learning outcome design, subject-liaisons, faculty-librarian
collaboration, targeted information literacy, rubrics, and current research.
Working with the general education program or with faculty in the disciplines is
vital when developing information literacy courses and programs. As one
instruction librarian explained in regard to curriculum articulation in curricula
goals, objectives and learning outcomes:
“We were…given recognition because of our articulation within the curriculum
and I actually think that’s really an important…thing to push for because unless…
unless information literacy is specifically articulated in curricular goals and
objectives, you don’t have the power to come in and say, we are experts in

248

information literacy let us consult with you on how to best teach this or what
concepts need to be taught…”
It is important to work with faculty to develop documentation that guides information
literacy course design and development, as this was explained further:
“I think we’ve done a lot of good things with planning so we have a lot of kind of
documents that help guide us to learning outcomes and shared learning outcomes
across different courses so you know we all teach these first year seminars but we
one shared learning outcome that we can assess that we know that that all
students in the first year seminar are getting this content.”
Clearly it is very useful to have learning outcomes developed for an information literacy
program, created as shared learning outcomes because when undergraduate students
change their majors at an institution, they would not have to retake information literacy
courses or miss out on them entirely. As an instruction librarian explained:
“These shared learning outcomes across all seminars” worked “so that the
person who was in Engineering can go to Biology and still have the skill or
knowledge you know independent of …information literacy skill that’s not
necessarily I guess, dependent on…disciplinary knowledge.”
Subject-liaison librarians played a major role in the implementation, design and teaching
of the information literacy course at the eight institutions in the study. Subject-liaison
librarians working with faculty in different disciplines worked with the information
literacy teaching and learning teams. These librarians participated in curriculum mapping
where decisions were made about which courses would have information literacy
embedded in them and thus these were “identifying the courses that give you the most

249

bang for your buck” because these courses had the largest numbers of student enrollment
and in most disciplines these were courses students had to take even if it was imminent
that they might change their majors several times e.g. writing courses and freshman or
sophomore psychology courses:
“There’s quite a significant percentage of student all across the United States
and beyond …who changed their major after the first year, so we don’t
necessarily focus too much on disciplinary knowledge but hope…we can get them
kind of started with our teaching and learning department and the real work with
the disciplinary information literacy skills happens with liaisons who have also
really strong commitments to and connections to the colleges and the upper
division classes so some of this milestone and capstone classes that students take
that help them with research components, the liaisons really take that by the
reigns at some point.”
At the same time, subject-liaison librarians were instrumental in designing subjectspecific information literacy courses and tutorials. As one instruction librarian explained:
“Librarians who work in that area have been very instrumental in helping them
you know design new curriculum and explore new ways in which they could
develop their competency-based curriculum.”
The liaison librarians played a major part in faculty-librarian collaboration, but all the
instruction librarians ultimately worked together as a team to make the information
literacy program work:
“I know one of the things that makes our program so good, is that we collaborate
with faculty, disciplinary faculty and we also collaborate with each other. We

250

have a highly, highly functional team…and that to me is one is one of the
cornerstones of what we do.”
Participants described the nature of the faculty-librarian collaboration at their campuses
differently but most saw it as a partnership where the information literacy course was not
really theirs alone but they saw themselves as co-owners that had a stake in the outcomes
of the information literacy course that was most often taught by the faculty and as
librarians they were either embedded in the course or were able to provide one-shot
opportunities or consultation and support for the course being taught. As one librarian
explained their situation:
“I think there’s a strong commitment to collaboration, to thinking of librarians
as partners in education and realizing that we have a stake in information literacy
on our campus and that we have co-ownership of that but it’s not ours. Our
faculty teach information literacy skills all of the time beyond the walls of our
library but knowing that we are also a partner in that and that we can be a really
valuable tool and a partner is kind of part of our identity here, which I think is
very...It’s a great way to feel, when you’re pounding the pavement, so to speak as
a librarian.”
In contrast at another institution, the Teaching and Learning Center worked with the
librarians to offer the information literacy course and provide training and professional
development to the faculty each semester. If the faculty was willing to work with the
librarians and include information literacy in their courses, on learning how to redesign
their courses so that they became student-centered, as one librarian explained then they
were provided with the opportunity for professional development:

251

“It’s our center for Teaching and Learning and IT unit that focuses on teaching
and learning in the libraries…are the primary partners who develop and provide
that program, right, in which 25-30 faculty each semester more or less take
something like a course and they meet once a week and learn about design
principles and how they can make their course more student centered and part of
that is information literacy so but you know I still think its to the library’s credit
that we were able to collaborate in that way that that program to be collaborating
with those other interview comments and this with those faculty.”
Participants in the study described a best practice that was being followed at larger
institutions. There was an emphasis on targeted or customized information literacy. This
practice was in place because there were many very specific populations that needed to
be served within the university, and as a result, librarians were focusing on these
communities and targeting them by providing them with information literacy activities or
sessions that were developed with specific goals and outcomes, to meet very specific
needs. Examples of these target populations on a campus were: veterans, international
students, adults returning to college with limited computer skills, and first generation
students. One librarian explained her experiences with targeted information literacy and
how this was currently a challenge at the institution:
“The best practices that we use, I guess are similar to what other schools are
doing where it’s not like a one size fits all sort of approach to information
literacy, but it is very customized and targeted to meet the needs of specific
programs. It might be looking

252

at our first-generation population that are coming in at our general education
level or it might be looking at more returning college students, adult, you know
older adults. You know we have a large veteran population on campus, I work
with disabled student services, we’re meeting the needs of a lot of different types
of students and trying to customize and offer you know like that human touch to
the library that’s not just this canned approach. And I see that best practice as we
grow is gonna be challenged, because it’s hard to scale and grow at the speed of
which we’re growing, and still provide these really personalized customized
experiences with different classes.”
It was further explained just how important it was for librarians to develop these
customized information literacy programs, versus generic programs, since they were best
practices that were applied that allowed librarians and faculty to gain a really good
understanding about these students:
“Where our students are coming from, the disciplinary learning outcomes, the
objectives that within a major or minor the faculty are expecting, looking at those
to make sure that students are really able to be information literate, be critical
thinkers in whatever project they’re doing and helping to translated that for
students, so that basically the value of it, why am I expected to use scholarly
literature or why should we question the research that we’re finding, it helps them
to become the best graduates that they can be when they go out into the world.”
Librarians in the study emphasized the importance of keeping up with best practices in teaching,
learning and information literacy by not only reading the current literature in these fields and
using what they learned to guide their practices.

253

“We try and look at the research that’s out and what seems to be working for the
same similar student body the same you know that kind of thing, you know what…
does the current research need to be saying is the best way to handle that.”
This would be done by participating in research about teaching, learning and information
literacy and sharing their classroom experiences with students with scholars and the
world:
“We're moving a lot more towards using synthesis and helping students how to
use synthesis matrix and we wrote a paper on helping students with synthesis and
the impact that had when there was a significant increase in students’ ability to
do part of a synthesizer for further research for their big research lesson.”
Librarians working at institutions in the study were actively involved in assessment of
both their information literacy courses and their programs.
.”We’re using rigorous assessment…we actually used one of the AAC&U rubrics
the Value rubrics and we modified it to fit our needs. We were basically looking to
see where students are struggling…you know a sequence of classes….we were
able to use that data to inform our approaches and inform our conversation
with...entities on campus.”
However, these assessments were aimed at determining whether or not students had
retained what they were being taught in information literacy tutorials and sessions. They
were not being conducted to determine whether or not students were information literate
or not. What was really important was instead, looking at how students were conducting
their research in the disciplines, and whether they were applying the skillsets they had

254

learned in their information literacy tutorials and classes, to discipline-specific research
assignments and projects.
“From my own experience when I’m looking at that, the grading of their final
projects, I see that a good majority of the students have implemented some of
what I’ve taught where they’ve found something that’s scholarly where they’ve
cited it, they’ve evaluated it, so there is that happening.”
Librarians were also working with their college assessment committees to establish
university-wide learning outcomes for information literacy courses developed for the
majors
“With our college assessment committee as we’re starting to look at that
particular college-wide learning outcomes to think about ways to do this a little
bit more effectively just because things start to vary and become much more
specialized as the students move out of those kind of multidisciplinary classes and
into the disciplinary classes where each one of them is expected to be thinking
about information somewhat differently by the time they graduate you know, but
then how do you synthesize that back into you know can they use information
literacy sort of for the purposes of living their lives as opposed to just working in
the disciplines.”
Writing instructors at one of the institutions in the study used rubrics in combination with
student transcripts to determine:
“If there was any sort of relationship or if correlation between in the grades they
were getting and the amount of library instruction that they had, if they had any
and we did see some positive relationships.”

255

Findings regarding best practices in this study indicated that instruction librarians were
using best practices in six areas that directly related to the development and design of the
information literacy course: in their reference interactions with students, in choosing
information literacy and teaching and learning models that would fit their institution’s
programs, in the development of information literacy curriculum, in curriculum and
program administration procedures and in assessing their information literacy courses and
programs.

Theme: Assessment
The “Assessment” Theme and Sub-Themes are listed above in Table 4.7. The
“Assessment” theme was organized into three sub-themes with a total number of 144
coded interview comments. Sixty-three interview comments were coded to the
“Assessment” theme. The three sub-themes associated with the “Assessment” theme
were “Assignments” to which 39 interview comments were coded, “Rubrics” as teachers
to which 23 interview comments were coded and “Standardized Tests” to which 19
interview comments were coded. The three sub-themes were interconnected since they
were important to programmatic assessment.

Instruction librarians in the study stated that they worked alongside their
institution’s assessment offices or departments and received help to correctly assess their
course and programmatic information literacy assessment projects successfully:
“We have an office of assessment on our campus and they are fantastic and so they
assess all the undergraduate learning outcomes.”

The librarians also explained that these information literacy assessments were completed
on a set cycle by their university assessment offices. In collaboration with the instruction
librarians and faculty who were teaching these information literacy courses:
“Information literacy went through a three-year assessment cycle a couple…a
number of years ago. they pick two learning outcomes every year and it’s a threeyear assessment, so information literacy was assessed and I think we might be
coming up next year and so they gonna you know the first year is deciding how
you’re going to do the assessment, the second year is collecting the data and then
the third year is sharing the data and closing the loop.”
It was found that all the instructors in the study taught information literacy to their
students in many different formats, but in each, they provided the students with
information literacy assignments which were either completed prior to the class in the
format of a tutorial, in-class or after the class. Depending on the collaboration
understanding these assignments were either graded by the faculty teaching the course,
depending on the specific collaboration the librarian had with the faculty member or by
the librarians and collected so that course assessment could be completed.
“So at the class level we’ll have a few different assignments. The library module
in GEL 101 is graded. It’s worth enough points that it’s the equivalent of a letter
grade for their for their first grade in that class. So there are assignments, kind of
258

working on steps in the research process, but then we also look at how they
synthesize and how well the find and synthesize the information that they find on
their research topic. So we actually have them do an infographic, a visual
representation of the research that they found, so it’s a little more interesting for
us to grade rather than an annotated bibliography, and it’s also more interesting
for the students to not just regurgitate what they find but synthesize and pullout
the key points and represent that data and research in a more visual way, so we
have a final project for that, for the GEL, for other courses in which we’re not a
graded component, the assessments really varied it depends on the relationship
between the faculty and the librarian, where we might have access to the final
projects online or if we’re part of that class we get to see the final projects, we get
to see what students do ultimately.”
At a large institution where there were a large number of sections of information literacy
classes, assessments were accomplished after a one-shot with students where they had
either completed a tutorial, a worksheet or an assignment. In classes were librarians and
faculty collaborated and students wrote papers, it was often the task of librarians to
develop their faculty-librarian relationship so that they would have access to the papers
that had been written in the professor’s class. AAC&U Value rubrics such as the Inquiry
and Analysis, the Information Literacy or the Critical Thinking were calibrated for use
with these classes. In those situations, one hundred random papers were then collected for
that assignment and marked using an AAC&U information literacy rubric that was
tweaked to meet the unique outcomes of the program:

259

“We’ll take the rubrics and adjust them too, but I like the language of a lot of
many of the rubrics. So we’ll take it and kind of play around with the language
and we’ll take things out, like we’ll take a criteria out or add a criteria if we think
that its better suited to or maybe its mix and match or so maybe we really like
something from the information literacy rubric but we also like something from
the critical thinking and we can put it all together and so I find this to be a great
starting place and a really great starting place for faculty too who are interested
in assessing student work.”
Interview findings indicated that standardized information literacy tests were less
common at larger institutions because librarians had to pay per student for test codes.
Also because larger institutions had more staff and resources to create their own
homegrown tests, but when these were created, they were often unable to answer
questions about what their students did not understand, and how they could teach their
one-shots better, as one librarian explained:
“I mean we’ve had a homegrown quiz that we gave for a number of years and we
looked at it and we thought ok, well we got how many students answered question
number seven correctly out of all multiple choice options but it still never gave us
information that we thought was actionable.”
One of the smaller colleges in the study did try to use standardized tests with their
students. However, just like with the homegrown information literacy tests, their
librarians found that these fell short. This was because even though they were able to tie
the questions their student’s missed back to the specific Association of College and

260

Research Libraries Standards (2000), test results still did not answer their questions about
their students’ progress in their classes, and as a result these were aborted:
“We did do the HEADS project, I can’t remember which school did that, but we
were really unhappy with that. The questions…there were just way too many
questions so we had a very poor response to it, whereas we had a really good
participation with the test that we had created, so we only did that for a year.”

Theme: Information Literate Students
The “Information Literate Students” Theme and Sub-Themes are listed in Table
4.8. The transcriptions that were analyzed can be found in Appendix K. The Theme and
Sub-Themes answer the question: “Are students at your institution information literate at
graduation?” The “Information Literate Students” theme was organized into 12 subthemes. One hundred and four interview comments were coded to this theme. The twelve
sub-themes associated with the “Information Literate Students” theme were “Anecdotal
Evidence” to which 19 interview comments were coded and “No measurements in place”
to which 14 interview comments were coded. Further sub-themes include “Disciplines
and Majors” to which 14 interview comments were coded, “Rubrics” to which 14
interview comments were coded and “Standardized Tests” to which 14 interview
comments were coded and General Education Outcomes to which 11 interview
comments were coded.

Sub-themes with less coded comments included: “Embedded Concepts and
Information Literacy Practices” with eight comments, “Lifelong Learning” with five
comments, “Faculty Involvement” with three Comments and “Core Competencies” with
three comments. Study participants provided the researcher with a great deal of anecdotal
evidence to explain why they believed their students to be information literate. As one
instruction librarian explained:
“I think that the way our general education program is structured what that
inquiry and critical thinking outcomes, that yeah, students would be graduating
more information literate.”
The instruction librarian also pointed out there were many facets of information literacy
and how students viewed these through the lenses of their disciplines and majors,
explained that this played a part in how and at what level students became information
literate:
“I don’t know…that a person will graduate information literate because I feel
that that’s all so contextual; information literate in what capacity, like there’s so
many disciplinary…kind of lenses that we put on info lit and contextual lenses it’s
difficult to say oh well they’re all information literate, there you know I think, but
I’m probably not saying this correctly or in a really eloquent way but there’s so
many facets to information literacy if they did graduate completely information
literate or information literate across multiple you know disciplines then I would
be incredibly impressed.”
One instruction librarian participating in the study suggested that they were unsure that
all students would graduate information literate enough so that their skills would benefit

263

them as lifelong learner. They were not sure that students would be able to transfer their
skills, whenever needed into the workplace or into skills necessary to accomplish
technology tasks in everyday life. Anecdotal evidence suggested that many would be able
to transfer skills as lifelong learners because information literacy training and teaching at
the institution was ongoing and students were also learning how to handle the technology
and would need to use what they learned to adapt to the technological changes that they
encountered outside the college in the workplace:
“There’s just so many technology changes at either end and workforces
change it and there’s so many things at play that I could say all our students are
information literate by the time they graduate, because it’s an ongoing process
you know.”
Institutions in this study used one of four types of information literacy assessment in their
courses that included the following: the use of rubrics, standardized information literacy
tests, homegrown information literacy tests and surveys. The most common information
literacy assessments being used by the three institutions in the study were the AAC&U
Rubrics:
“So we use the Value Rubrics but we’ve made our own tweaks with that. So we
use the information literacy value rubric and we use that to score student
products and so she does all the analysis about where these skills are and so in
theory when students graduate they should be up to about a four, and our students
are more typically like around a three so we know we’re doing we’re doing well
but we’re not doing enough.”

264

Librarians suggested that they had used standardized tests and homegrown tests in the
past to assess student information literacy skills at their institutions, but they found that
often these tests did not answer their questions or provide the quality results that they
were expecting, as one instruction librarian explained:
“In our experience with the standardized tests particularly the ones that involve
multiple choice questions, we’ve never really gotten information that told us what
we really wanted to know; and it could be that we’re our standards are very high,
if they could be extremely high, but that’s been our experience. I mean we’ve had
a homegrown quiz that we gave for a number of years and we looked at it and we
thought ok, well we got how many students answered question number seven
correctly out of all multiple choice options but it still never gave us information
that we thought was actionable.”
No institution in the study had implemented any form of measurement that would allow
instructors to determine if students were information literate when they were seniors and
about to graduate, although several forms of information literacy assessments were done
at different levels of the student’s information literacy instruction journey, satisfying
learning outcomes associated with courses or programs.
“We are still trying to work out, like you said, basically like how do we tell if
information literate? Um, we haven't quite gotten that far yet, because we are
only into year three of the new core. So there is still a lot of stuff that needs to be
worked out, including how we end up actually measuring the learning outcomes
at the university level.”

265

However, in Spring 2013, one of the institutions in the study did a general education
assessment using the AAC&U Information Literacy Value Rubric that had been tweaked
to fit the institution’s outcomes. The information literacy assessment was part on an
institution-wide assessment that participated in cyclical assessment and assessed eight
general education outcomes of which information literacy was one. Sixty-nine products
from 84 students in undergraduate classes, a 100-level psychology class and a 300-level
humanities class were scored. The information literacy results were listed in Table 4.9
suggest that students taking upper-division courses scored extremely well on two
products when compared with students taking lower-division courses. They scored an
average 91.3% on the five outcomes taken from the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) compared with lower-division students who scored on average
76.6%. However, it was a different case entirely, when three or more student products
were scored using the same outcomes. It was most disturbing to note that the students in
upper-level courses scored 22% on average, having a much lower score than the students
in lower-level courses, whose average score was 37%. Without viewing the products it is
hard to say why this enormous discrepancy occurred, but due to the second set of scores
it cannot be assumed that all the students have satisfied the course outcomes and are in
fact information literate.

Study participants were hopeful that measures that determined if students were
information literate at graduation would be in place in the future at their institutions.
Participants often claimed that it was either too early in their program development, or
they had not had time to consider this concern and develop necessary assessment
procedures for their seniors:
“I wish it was possible to follow Suzi Q all the way to her senior year and to say,
you know, did she retain and gain and, but that’s not a study that anyone that I
know of has done here where they followed specific students through. So I can
only hope, you know, that the connections that we make with the first year and the
second year with the students are laying the groundwork and hopefully we’ll
increase those tests that um are given to them you know in their junior and senior
years um as the…time goes on.”
One institution participating in the study was preparing to participate in a national survey
(PIL).
“We’re looking we’re taking a look at their capstone projects um an eye towards
how they how they used information and how they…what their research process
was like um so we’re really interested to see that…because we don’t we know how
students are graduating from college information literate but we’re going to look
at that senior level work and then also, this year we were part of …Project
Information Literacy um studies so Allison Head has been leading that project
information literacy study for quite a few years and their most recent thing was
looking at recent college graduates…who have stayed sort of in the same area
where they graduated from college.”

268

Another institution was aware of a study that was being developed within the consortium
their institution was participating in (GWILA) that would track student GPA’s and
determine whether or not graduating students were information literate.
“They track the GPA and they kind of look to see is there any correlation with
English with the with the writing class that they retaking or the library classes so
I think that’s kind of what that GWILA assessment project is looking at.”
How information literacy was taught within the disciplines and majors at institutions was
found to be very important when it came to whether or not students were information
literate at graduation. Instructors suggested that if they did not have the opportunity to
work with faculty in a discipline then students in the discipline were considered less
likely to graduate information literate as one instructor explained:
“I think it depends on the discipline quite frankly…before I moved…
I worked with the Sociology Department for a very long time and
I worked with very very many of the faculty and I would say that
those students were very more likely to be information literate than um
we don’t do a lot of work with Computer Science. We don’t do any
work with them at all actually.”
Instruction librarians emphasized the need to develop strong relationships with faculty in
different departments at their institutions, as this allowed them to work closely with the
faculty on developing information literacy specific course outcomes in a discipline or
major:
“Information literacy is embedded within the core outcomes the expectations
within the upper level of the curriculum and so departments have to say how they

269

are meeting these different outcomes and as we said information literacy isn’t an
explicit part of it, it is embedded within it and so those will be assessed at some
point.”
This collaboration with faculty in the disciplines allowed librarians to better understand
course goals and objectives and how they could best help students with research in their
discipline-specific courses and become critical thinkers. As one instruction librarian
explained:
“I think there will be some growing pains but the best practice, the really
understanding where our students are coming from, the disciplinary learning
outcomes, the objectives that within a major or minor the faculty are expecting,
looking at those to make sure that students are really able to be information
literate, be critical thinkers in whatever project they’re doing and helping to
translated that for students, so that basically the value of it, why am I expected to
use scholarly literature or why should we question the research that we’re
finding, it helps them to become the best graduates that they can be when they go
out into the world, but I think some of our best practices of really embedding into
the curriculum and looking a learning outcomes and finding the places where we
can deepen their learning and their research experience will stay at the heart of
what we do, but we’re also figuring out how to scale and grow those.”
Faculty-librarian collaboration also has led to their being placed on curriculum
committees where decisions are made about college-wide assessments and outcomes and
since information literacy assessments. However, in those cases the assessments were not
being used to find out if students were indeed information literate when they graduate.

270

There is however, a possibility that librarians would be in a position to have faculty
committees consider these assessments for future implementation, as a librarian
explained:
“…at some point I can work a little bit more extensively with our college
assessment committee as we’re starting to look at that particular college-wide
learning outcomes to think about ways to do this a little bit more effectively.”
Study findings indicated that librarians had very different opinions about what it meant
for their students to be information literate. They explained that information literacy was
in fact:
“Embedded in what…how much they can accomplish and do in their major and
in their other classes.”
suggesting that:
“Information literacy has been buried to some extent depending on
the…major…so honestly we’ve never found a way to measure this that we’re
perfectly happy with.”
There were also librarians that were more radical about their beliefs regarding
information literacy and what it means to have information literate students:
“From a more theoretical standpoint I don’t ever necessarily believe that
students are ever information illiterate I think they have different abilities and
different practices…because thinking about literacy is sort of like a it’s you know
like us filling this deficit…I don’t necessarily like to approach it that way because
I think that students have strategies
that work for them and we should recognize that and be ok with those things.”

271

Participants explained that students were not “empty vessels" when they entered their
college experience, but they came from rich social environments where they had
developed varied types of experience with information and technology use:
“They’re not empty vessels when they arrive to us. They’re bringing their own
sets of expertise, their own knowledge, their own awareness of different in their
communities, so they’re…so I think they are very savvy information users and I
think that there’s still room for growth.”
For all the institutions in the study, including those colleges who in the past had
implemented standardized information literacy tests but no longer gave them, only
anecdotal evidence was available to back up the notion that their seniors were applying
the information literacy skills they had learned while in college to their final projects and
that students were graduating information literate. Librarians saw a shift in the research
habits of the students they had worked with, where these students were changing from
merely entering college as students, and emerging as scholars.
“Somewhere between the first semester and their graduation, there’s some change after
they take the… with us, but the real growth I think isn’t demonstrated until their senior
year where they’re doing these much higher level research projects, and they’re not just
finding scholarly literature but they’re engaging in their own research, their own
undergraduate research in different projects, in service-learning or in field work, where
they’re conducting interviews, they’re gathering data field themselves, so then they’re
really making that transition from student to scholar but that’s not really evident until
later… on in their degree.”

Librarians also pointed out that they had anecdotal evidence in hand that showed that
there were students graduating from their colleges that were information literate. This

272

was because after graduation there were students reporting that they were using their
problem-solving skills in their daily lives, and that they had the research skills to succeed
in graduate school. As one librarian explained:
“We hear back from students that are in graduate school about how far ahead
their skills are compared to classmates. That they’ve already done you know
problem-based learning and research in that way or they’re already done this or
that and so that tells us that we’re on the right track and that a lot of our students
get into grad school because they’ve got those kinds of skills.”
The study findings regarding whether or not graduating seniors are information literate or
not indicated that although there was a great deal of anecdotal evidence that instructors
provided that their students were information literate when they graduated, and that they
were lifelong learners, no institutions had implemented tests for seniors that determined
whether they were graduating information literate or not.
Theme: The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000)
The “Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000)” theme had
16 total interview comments and was listed in Table 4.10. Twelve interview comments
were coded to this theme. There was one sub-theme, “The Preempted Standards” (what
existed before the Framework). This sub-theme had four interview comments coded to it.
This sub-theme emerged because it stood out from the major theme. This was because
instruction librarians were convinced that they were already implementing many
information literacy concepts in their classroom that now had a relation to the Framework
(2016), long before it was formalized and many librarians were waiting to see what other
librarians would do with the Framework (2016). As one librarian aptly explained:

273

“We shall see when we have a chance to update the entire university community
to the Framework. While we have worked with the ideas in the Framework for
many years (hasn’t everyone?) now is not the time for us to upset the new
program with another new rubric.”

Courses developed in programs across all institutions, emphasized tool literacy
elements which related back to the “Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000)” because tool literacy laid the foundation for student learning and also
because a knowledge of how to find resources and use the library databases enabled
student learners to master content and extend their investigations, thereby becoming
“more self-directed, and assume greater control over their own learning” (Association of
College and Research Libraries Standards, 2000) and better understand more complex

274

information literacy concepts. As one instruction librarian explained about teaching
students in the disciplines how to do subject-specific database searches:
“I’m teaching them to use PUBMED. I…We run it through a workshop kind of
formatting; you know questions that they need to answer this is usually an upper
level Biology course. I do it when I’m teaching Chem abstracts, where it’s upper
level Chemistry students, when we really need nuanced sort of searches and learn
a lot of details about filters and all that kind of thing”.
The librarians interviewed were articulate about not just using the Association of College
and Research Libraries Standards (2000) religiously. They stated that they also on
occasion used other types of research about information literacy practices to inform their
own practices. Support from the research was particularly useful when teaching
information literacy courses that moved them beyond one-shots with their students
connecting with them at point of need, as one librarian explained:
“I think the great thing about our course, about the program itself is that it’s not
just you know we’re not we’re trying to do…a lot of it is tied back to these
different ACRL Standards but then we’re also using…you know other research to
inform our practices so… we have the high touch approach meaning that we’re
yeah really trying to just move past the just one shot classes and instead you know
being integrated where students have the point of need where it’s not just we’re
popping in on you on the first day of class you know where they don’t where its
more an abstract thing where they don’t really have an assignment that’s tied to
you know the course.”

275

Even though there were librarians who were adamant that they were not planning to use
the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy
for Higher Education (2016) anytime soon, the same librarians were discussing the
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016) amongst one another and how future library initiatives would be
impacted by its application.
“The new Framework is out, we’re not using that either formally but we do
definitely, we’ve have had numerous discussions about it, you know, the faculty in
the library and talked about how it influences our initiatives and programming
and what we can glean from it that’s useful.”
Theme: The Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)
The “Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016)” Theme and Sub-Theme are listed in Table 4.11. A
total of 30 interview comments were coded to the “Association of College and Research
Libraries Framework” theme. Twenty-five interview comments were coded to the main
theme and five interview comments were coded to the sub-theme, “Preempted
Standards.”

There were institutions in the study that embraced concepts and specific frames
connected to the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework (2016) when
building their course assignments. Some still technically used the Standards (2000), even
though in some situations they had not changed their course or program outcomes to
include the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and still thought that:
“… the ACRL Standards underpins the work of all libraries” and were
considering it and how it might apply in the best way to teach students in their
programs:
“The new Framework is out, we’re not using that either formally but we do
definitely, we’ve have had numerous discussions about it, you know, the faculty in

277

the library and talked about how it influences our initiatives and programming
and what we can glean from it that’s useful.”
One instruction librarian explained about just such application of the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) in their class:
“We had an entire module about types of information right and that speaks to the
distinguishing between popular and scholarly sources and in our first iteration
what we do is what a lot of people do is, these are the characteristics of each
source, well in the second revision we kind of flipped that on its head and
basically our approach was the way that information is created makes different
information so we focused more on like how scholarly sources are created and
how popular sources are created…you know sort of granular sort of distinctions
between those two. So we did that instead and you know that is something where
we definitely responded to the Framework…”
The “Pre-Empted Framework” theme showed that librarians were vigilant about any
changes that were being made to the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000). The participants explained that they had expected a change of some
kind, but for many institutions, by the time the Association of College and Research
Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) was adopted
by Association of College and Research Libraries, they had already made changes to their
information literacy course outcomes to reflect the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) which had been in place as a standard for sixteen years. Thus,
they could not include the new Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) because they would

278

have to begin the entire administrator and faculty vetting process again, which often took
years. As one librarian explained:
“The Framework was not created when we revised University Studies, so we the
university adopted those standards as our student outcomes for information
literacy and that was mainly because that’s what I suggested that we do, and then
as soon it was like a year after everything was adopted and everything was in
place, that’s when ACRL came up with the new Framework (laughs) so the timing
was horrible.”
One of the colleges in the study that still adhered to Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) used both the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000) and the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) in their creation of Community of
Online Research Assignments (CORA). CORA is an open access database created to
ingest and share instructor information literacy assignments across the globe (Loyola
Marymount University, 2016), as described by one librarian:
“We started creating a database of information literacy assignments and so it’s
in beta right now but it called CORA, Community of Online Research
Assignments and CORA you can search by the old information ACRL standards
or the new Framework.”
The creation of CORA was a positive step in the direction of offering online support to
instruction librarians who were teaching information literacy in the classroom and
applying elements and concepts of either or both the ACRL Standards (2000) and the
ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) as best practices

279

in their course and program assignments. The database will allow instructors to upload
and share their assignments online with the library community for future adoption or
adaptation in the classroom.

The Information Literacy Course: Online or Blended: A Comparative Analysis
Table 4.12 describes the “Information Literacy Course Type Subsidiary Theme.”
Even though this theme and also that of the “Online Course” were subsidiary, they were
important and central in terms of creating a comparative analysis of the eight institutions
studied. The “Online Course” was a subsidiary theme of the “General Education
Program” theme but it is described here because it was one of the five themes with the
most interview comments coded to it and also because understanding how the “Online
Course” fits into the information literacy programs of the institutions studied was vital to
this study and its outcomes.
The “Online Course” had 74 interview comments coded to it, was a sub-theme of
the “Information Literacy Course” which had 39 unique interview comments coded to it.
The “Information Literacy Course” sub-theme had one subsidiary theme, “Information
Literacy Course Type” having a total of 100 interview comments coded to it. The
“Online Course” was listed as one of four “Information Literacy Course Types”
encountered during the study. The three information literacy course types were: the
Blended Course which had four interview comments coded to it, Distance Education
which had 17 interview comments coded to it and the face-to-face course which had three
comments coded to it.

“Blended” versus “Online Course” at universities in the study can be found in
Table 4.13. Based on the information gathered from instructor interviews regarding the
status of the online information literacy course and whether or not these were being
taught at the institutions in the study, the findings were that only 50% of the participant
institutions offered their students online information literacy courses. The Table 4.19 also
explains which universities offered courses with online components, and blended courses
and which were offering Online Courses.
A pilot study was conducted at one university during the summer, while an
additional institution was in the process of developing online courses because their
student population was steadily growing and they did not have enough librarians to teach
one-shots or via an embedded librarian approach. Institutions in the study also created
online library tutorials that were made available to their students via their university
library Youtube channels, and while other institutions used course broadcasting from
their main campus, allowing their library instructors to connect directly with distance
students taking courses at institutional sites. Two of the institutions had not yet
implemented online library courses, but online initiatives were being considered and put
into place for future online pursuits.

As described in Table 4.13, four out of the eight institutions in the study offered
online information literacy courses to their students. The two smallest universities in the
study did not offer online information literacy courses but their courses offerings to
students were blended since they included a large amount of online-components such as
online videos, interactive tutorials and online information literacy games. A librarian
from the said institution stated that they were tied to their undergraduate agenda and
emphasized the in-person experience and thus did not offer online information literacy
courses:
“I think part of the reason that our school is not doing online yet is because we
are primarily an undergraduate institution and our faculty and campus
governance are very much committed to sort of…so our mission is the education
of the whole person and so incorporating a distance education program when you
know we want students to be participating in campus service learning”.
Two universities, in the study were both in the online course development phase but for
different reasons. One institution was developing online courses because they did not
have the staff to continue to offer one-shots to a growing number of information literacy
sections at their college.
“So we're coming up with a better way of knowing this kind of things and we are
also coming up with I think a better adaptation for online modules and part of
that is making tough decisions like pulling out of face-to-face program with 1010,
so that way we can focus more on building online modules and we can focus on
our 2010 that we know all students are taking versus nearly 40% taking 1010.”

284

One institution in the study was implementing a new online initiative introduced
by a new provost, and was planning to implement online information literacy courses in
the not too distant future. As a librarian explained:
“We’ve probably had a smattering of online offerings, when I came here in 2011,
and with our new provost, he put together a new taskforce to explore what we are
doing and what we should be doing and then developed a new department it is
called Digital Learning that is now carrying that charge forward.”
Based on data gathered from interviews with librarians at each of the eight institutions in
the study, Table 4.14 was created. Each site in the study had a formal general education
program which was described in depth in Question 1 and which included either goals,
objectives or outcomes that provided the library with the opportunity to implement
information literacy. As was the example at one university in the study:
“Our General Administration…they decided I think it was last summer that one
of our outcomes was going to be critical thinking. They wanted all of our
graduates community college and four-year institutions to graduate with critical
thinking as part of their outcome”.
Each institution’s general education program was designed and developed to fit the
college or university’s mission, vision, objectives and outcomes. Each institution’s
libraries either had administrators or librarians that were part of or had input into their
institution’s general education program administrative team, for example, University
Studies Program served as information literacy gatekeepers aiding the integration process
or redesigning courses or implementing at their institutions that would integrate
information literacy.

285

“Our library instruction program outcomes are taken directly from the university
undergraduate learning outcomes, so as a whole xxxxx has these undergraduate learning
outcomes that include critical thinking and inquiry as well as lifelong learning and then
there are you know smaller learning outcomes under those big overarching universal
learning outcomes and that’s where our instruction program’s outcomes come from
directly we just take those as our own and work toward those university goals.”

Each institution had integrated information literacy into their freshman core or first year
experience program as it best suited their program and had also developed a liaison
program and a method by which they integrated information literacy into the majors at
their institutions. Table 4.14 explains the nature of the information literacy course
integration at each institution and highlights characteristics.
“So the xxx driving idea for our instruction program is that information literacy
should be embedded in every discipline and in relevant courses and so librarians
are embedded in programs and courses um it’s not a standalone set of skills but
rather is integrated throughout the curriculum. So we have um undergraduate
learning librarians who work with the freshman composition class and with first
year seminars across the university and every in every college to with faculty on
developing research assignments and then teaching students the skills they need
to be successful in those research assignments and then we have a department of
library liaisons who work with upper division students and graduate students
across every department um similarly working with faculty on assignment design
and then working with students on developing the skills and knowledge to do that
kind of research in their disciplines.”

Nvivo 11 Plus provided the researcher with the opportunity to further analyze
librarian transcripts. Each transcript was grouped to better understand what each
institution considered to be important. From this data, eight word clouds were created.

Online Instruction and Blended/Hybrid Instruction and Questions 2 & 3
Findings showed that blended learning is a common occurrence across all eight
exemplary institutions in this study, although there are some universities who refused to
acknowledge that they were in fact participating in blended learning during their
teaching. The Clayton Christiansen Institute (2016) defined blended or hybrid learning as
a formal education program in which a student learns partly “through online learning,
with some element of student control over time, place, path, and/or pace” face-to-face
classroom interaction, allowing for the student to participate in “an integrated learning
experience.” All eight institutions offered their students blended experiences ranging the
flipped classrooms, online tutorials, face-to-face one-shots to information literacy games,
and instruction in how to use library resources and databases. The most common use of
blended instruction was the online tutorial, where the instructors had their freshman
prepare for their visit to the library by completing a tutorial. Other libraries studied
created a series of tutorials on different information literacy topics that students had to
complete. As one information literacy instructor explained:
“We have a bunch of Libguides or online research guides we use in conjunction
with almost all of our information literacy sessions. Students are using technology
when their using the Libguides it’s just not as obvious. Then we do have a bunch
of online tutorials that cover a lot of the information literacy skills.”

288

In only three of the largest universities online information literacy courses were being
offered. However, this is still not a common occurrence and most information literacy
classes at these large institutions are conducted as face to face one-shots with blended
learning components.
“In all my classes I develop modules directly in Canvas our learning
management system and in that it’s sometimes courses built into Canvas and
they’re used to pull everywhere for some of the broadcast classes in the past
where the students are at different locations, kind of physically at those locations
where they’re able to see the screen, the instructor’s screen and have
conversation but they don’t always have a computer.”
The most common blended learning components used by instructors across the eight
institutions in their blended information literacy classes included the following: learning
management system modules, open education resources, servers, library webpages,
broadcast classes at specific sites for distance students, online tutorials and videos often
loaded on a Youtube Channel or elsewhere, embedded librarians, discussion boards,
Libguides and guide on the side. One of the librarians explained how they worked with
their online student resources at their library:
“The platform we use is Youtube. For our tutorials, the other ones, the ones for
the online Ed. users, they have a Youtube Channel but they also have their own
servers so they’re not open education resources, some of them are closed but for
ours, ours are on the Youtube Channel so and then we have a page and then we
do have library faculty and teaching faculty who just take that and embed that in
a web page or a LibGuide in all kinds of different places.”

289

The embedded librarian was also a common occurrence at the larger universities in the
study. As an instruction librarian explained by saying that:
“The driving idea for our instruction program is that information literacy should
be embedded in every discipline and in relevant courses and so librarians are
embedded in programs and courses.”
However, at the smallest universities in the study it was somewhat different as one
librarian explained:
“Information literacy wasn't formally embedded into any of the courses, so it's
kind of like a hit or miss whether they happen to get any library instruction or any,
you know, even how many resource assignments.”

At the larger institutions in the study, liaison-librarians were embedded in either online or
blended courses and worked with faculty in the content majors to embed information
literacy in their subject specific courses. Librarians watched the student discussion board
posts and often responded as personal librarians when direct library-related questions
were asked. Additionally, they watched what questions were posted by students and
where they could support students by teaching them about how best to use library
resources and materials in their courses. Some librarians were embedded in a content
course and offered tutorials to students. They aided students with their course modules
that required them to complete library-related assignments or course-related papers and
these were then assessed. As one librarian explained how a longitudinal information
literacy assessment was conducted at their institution after they had been embedded
teaching information literacy in a course:
“They take another course that has information literacy embedded in it, it’s not
an information literacy course but it’s embedded in it in the second or third year
290

and so… they’re giving that same test she developed to those students to…and
then they’ll see students who took her course or didn’t and sort of compare how
they do on that test after a time has passed, after a year has passed, do they retain
it or do better than our colleagues who take the course.”
Summary
The research question posed was: How are exemplary 4-year colleges
implementing exemplary information literacy courses? The major themes answering
Question 1, Table 4.1 were directly related to the general education programs at each
institution that had 396 interview comments coded to it, were identified, with the most
prominent total numbers of coded interview comments which were: 174 interview
comments related to “Strategic Planning,” 319 interview comments related to
“Administration,” 108 interview comments related to “Best Practices in Information
Literacy” 144 interview comments related to “Assessment,” 104 interview comments
related to “Information Literate Students,” 14 interview comments related to “The
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000),” and 27 interview
comments related to “The Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016).”
Major findings included the development of a description of the information
literacy program process at colleges and universities based on how participants explained
their information literacy programs and course offerings during interviews. The model
was not based on the literature and was developed as a diagram, aided by an @Randall
Library Poster. Library strategic plans were often created to include the requirements of
the college accrediting body, especially when there were important competencies such as

information literacy that were proposed as best practices in area institutions. Study
findings indicated further that when librarians made their plans to create an information
literacy course, they started with their institution as well as their library’s strategic
planning documents specifically, their institutional and library mission statements. These
were used as a guide for how to start the course outcomes development and course
building process. It was also found that when the library’s strategic plan was developed,
the library’s mission and vision were most often in-line with that of the institution, so that
when goals and objectives were written that would guide library programming, such as an
information literacy program.
The findings suggested further that information literacy programs in institutions
were most successful when the library’s program was supported by the institution’s
administration. Instruction librarians used best practices in reference, program
administration, course outcomes, collaboration, information literacy course development
and assessment to create viable information literacy courses that worked within the
programs and disciplines into which they were implemented. Study findings also
suggested, that librarians applied teaching, learning and information literacy best
practices when developing, designing, teaching and assessing information literacy
courses at their institutions. Successful information literacy course and program
implementation in all eight institutional settings were dependent on the collaborative
arrangements made between the instructional librarians and the faculty. The instruction
librarians also worked with the faculty to integrate information literacy into their courses,
so if the faculty wanted them to participate as an embedded librarian in an online course,
they worked with the faculty to do so. If outcomes had not yet been created in relation to

292

information literacy or if library resources were needed in order to develop the
information literacy portions of the course further on faculty request, librarians worked to
make these accessible. The findings also suggested that institutions in the study could
only provide anecdotal evidence regarding whether or not their students were graduating
information literate. None of the institutions in the study provided their seniors with
assessments that determined whether students were information literate at graduation.

Research Question 2

The research question asked: How do exemplary 4-year college library
information literacy courses implement the Association of College and Research
Libraries Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education (2016)?
The purpose of the study was to understand how the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework for Higher Education (2016) had been implemented by
institutions in the study in their information literacy courses.
Participant interviews in Question 2 were coded by hand using emerging or
bottom-up coding using coded topics unique to instruction and information literacy. The
Question 2 Themes and Sub-Themes are listed in Table 4.15. When participant
interviews were coded to answer question two a total number of 102 interview comments
were coded and seven themes emerged. These were: The Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016),
The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000), Combination,

293

Guidelines, Non-Application, General Education Program, and Rubrics & Additional
Standards. There were 23 sub-themes organized under the seven themes.

Question 2 Themes and Sub-Themes
Table 4.15 describes the themes and subthemes in Question 2. There were seven
themes and 22 sub-themes. One of the larger sub-themes, which had seven coded
interview comments, was the “Pre-empted” theme, which was defined by participants
that librarians at their institutions had already identified what is described as the
Framework. That means that before the formalized “Framework” was created, the frames
and the theories were already being implemented in the classroom. For example, the
frame “Authority is constructed and contextual” was taught be teaching students what
peer-reviewed source were and how to find credible sources in their field and cite them.
Students were taught how to evaluate sources and determine the authority of authors
comparing source authority for websites, blogs and scholarly periodicals with trade
publications and understanding the differences. As a result, it was common that librarians
teaching exemplary information literacy courses considered themselves to be early
implementers of what is now described in the Framework. In their information literacy
instruction programs, since several of the ideas that are included in this model were
already being put into practice at several institutions prior to the Framework (2016) being
formalized. These institutions believed that their instruction models and practices preempted or existed before the Framework (2016) and its theories as it is now accepted and
formalized.
Instruction librarians at six of the eight exemplary institutions studied, where the
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) had not been hardcoded

294

into their undergraduate learning outcomes, were implementing the Association of
College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016) concepts in their information literacy classes. This implementation was
happening for two reasons, either they had pre-empted the Framework concepts and were
already teaching those concepts in their information literacy courses and had for several
years prior to the release of the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy (2016), or they were open and willing to experiment
with the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and its frames. Thus, these institutions were using
both the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the
Framework and other Standards from different disciplines together to meet their unique
learning outcomes.

TOTAL # INTERVIEW
COMMENTS

296

Seven interview comments were coded as Pre-empted in the interviews because librarians
said:
“We started looking you know evaluating, finding, evaluating, synthesizing like
some of the things the reflection some of the words that were king of change
works or things that had not maybe previously been in the Standards, I think we
sort of realized that we’d been doing this.”
While another instructor from different institution tried to explain further:
“You know honesty we pre-empted the Framework a little bit. We knew that it
was coming, we weren’t involved…We might have individually provided feedback
on it but we by at least two or three years we had moved away from the
mechanistic kills and more towards critical thinking about information.
Information literacy isn’t about finding, using, evaluating information that is a
piece of it. We’re looking more at critical thinking written large because you
can’t be information literate if you can’t think critically.”
There were three sub-themes around the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) that were less
complimentary, since instructors believed that from a theoretical stance the Framework
represented “high level concepts” (two coded interview comments) which were as yet
“un-measurable” (one coded unit), which were generally introduced to students in their
majors and not at the freshman level. They were also critical of the Association of
College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016) suggesting that they were unable to teach all the frames to the students

297

in their classes, since they did not see the necessity for teaching anything that did not
fulfill their unique outcomes. As one librarian pointed out:
“Okay, so my response to what the Framework…it’s heading in the right
direction and makes a lot of sense to me…as far as how we use it we haven’t
really sat there and say oh we’re going to now teach research inquiry, we don’t
necessarily do that because we are still strongly about the learning outcomes that
we have written that are meaningful to us and kind of match our campus
culture…we use ACRL Framework and other standards as
an information item or a launching point of inspiration.”
Despite the negative views that abounded at some institutions associated with
implementing the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016), there are also those instructors that
were interested in implementation and application and three interview comments were
coded in the sub-theme “incorporating into curriculum” (three coded interview
comments). There were other Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education
(2016) critics who had realized the importance of the new Framework (2016), not only
because they had pre-empted the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework and were already applying the concepts the Framework (2016) was
suggesting be introduced, but they already had created their own unique undergraduate
learning outcomes that were very similar to the Framework (2016) concepts to show for
that. They were willing to test their own undergraduate learning outcomes unique to their
institution by having their students take the TATIL (Threshold Assessment Test for
Information Literacy Assessment) that had just been created in 2015 as a means of

298

assessing each of the frames of the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016). In relation to this the
instruction librarian said:
“I think that what I understand…the TATIL has a test for each frame…they’re
offering a mix and match, so I don’t know if we could pick and choose the
questions that direct apply it to our learning outcomes at xxxxx and maybe
measure it that way. I mean I don’t think our learning outcomes are radically
different from the frames.”
Exploring what instructors thought about moving toward implementing the Framework,
under the “Application & Alignment” sub-theme an instructor explained that
“We try to throw in these higher level learning concepts when it makes sense to
do…we did it a little bit in our tutorial for our first year seminar students, we did
through in a little section about the scholarly conversation and we changed our
types of information section to move away from focusing on format and more just
focusing on like what kind of information it is, so we did make little tweaks here
and there to try to incorporate the concepts from the frameworks a little bit
more.”
Instructors were also combining specific parts of the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) and the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and were as one
librarian suggested, moving towards a combination or hybridization of the two guidelines
when students received their instruction. The sub-theme “hybrid” had two interview

299

comments coded to it, because the instructors were already commenting on this
happening in their classrooms. As one librarian suggested:
“You know in the future as we go further away from the Framework
implementation we’re gonna see more of this hybrid, I feel, of the two, you know
‘cause a lot of schools have invested time into that original document and it’s
kind of hard to just midstream tell everyone to just dump it.”
Library instructors were also candid about not only the hybridization of the Association
of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) but
also about including other rubrics in the mix because they believed that “Personalization”
which was a sub-theme under the major “Combination” theme and to which eight
interview comments were coded.
“Let’s say we’re using a combination still yeah, we it’s definitely informing our
practice but we haven’t switched over entirely… it’s definitely in line with what
we’ve been thinking again going from the skill-based to the Standards in our
minds are more skill based, and moving to the…switching…to more of a higher
order of thinking skills.”
There were also institutions suggesting that since they promoted a high level of academic
freedom and instructors and faculty collaboratively chose and applied educational
approaches that best suited their presentations within the major. As an instruction
librarian explained:
“You know there’s a lot of personalization taking what the standards are and
applying it to how it relates to our program, that’s exactly what we’re doing and

300

different libraries faculty will approach it in a different way and that’s the
freedom that they have in terms of their faculty status”
It was also later pointed out in the same vein that:
“You know one of the best practices was about encouraging and allowing a lot of
different pedagogic approaches and I think that would be true for us though. I
think that you know within a large distributed environment like ours people take
on a lot of different theoretical approaches and so some of those theoretical
approaches which probably align with disciplines they’re working with you know
they bring to there.”
Instructors were also forthcoming about how they used the AAC&U Value Rubrics
alongside the Framework and Standards in their classes, and how they were also making
use of other Standards this combination was working well for them in their subject
specific information literacy classes. The “AAC&U Rubrics” had 13 interview
comments coded to it, while five interview comments were coded to subject specific
standards. An instructor explained about the AAC&U Rubrics:
“So we’ve used the AAC& U Value Rubrics for information literacy and critical
thinking and communication to develop our rubrics for looking at student work at
the freshman level, at the junior level and at the senior level they’ve been really
useful to us in creating those assessment tools and then as I said that they also
provided a lot of the language ant eh major outcomes for our university learning
outcomes to that’s sort of the framework that we’re working within.”
In addition, instruction librarians were also very articulate about the other standards they
were using in their instruction sessions:

301

“So there’s one Framework that’s not information literacy specific but it’s the
Framework written by the Writing professors of America, and like the Writing
Council, which is like sort of the what is it called, it’s basically an outline for
what students should doing a first year writing program, what students should
know about writing and there’s a whole lot of overlap with information literacy
concepts and standards in that particular document”.
In-relation to this discussion about using additional standards other than those from
Association of College and Research Libraries in their information literacy classes
specifically with students in their majors, another instruction librarian from a different
institution stated:
“So our Science Librarian works with different professional standards, so our
Nursing Librarian for example is using healthcare and nursing standards, our K12 teacher education students, they’ve got national and state standards, so in a
given discipline there may be more specific outcomes…there are guidelines that
layered on top of them.”
Librarians pointed out the importance of implementing these standards in their classes
because they were important to the faculty they were working with and whose subject
areas they were creating their information literacy courses to support.
Theme: The Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016), Combination and Rubrics &
Additional Standards
The Question 2 Themes and Sub-Theme are listed in Table 4.15. The total n
number of interview comments coded in answering Question 2 was 102. There are 27
interview comments coded to this theme and there were 6 related sub-themes. The largest

302

sub-theme was “application & alignment” since 19 interview comments were coded to it.
As a result, there were several instances in the interviews where instruction librarians
explained that they were already teaching the six frames and therefore applying their
knowledge of the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016), its six frames and the related theory
when teaching students in the classroom. In one such instance the instruction librarian
clarifies exactly why they went forward in implementing the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework (2016) in their classes and what this application has led
to:
“The framework has provided very useful language for us that articulated a lot of
things that we’re doing but I would say more than that, we got tired of the
Standards and we didn’t like how narrow and limiting the Standards were and a
small handful of us started learning about critical librarianship and critical
information literacy and once that was kind of the impetus for our moving away
from those mechanics and so like said that was at least a year or two or three
before the Framework started to be publicized.”

Theme: The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000)
“The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000)” theme had
29 coded interview comments, with three sub-themes, application & alignment that had
16 interview comments, mechanistic/tool literacy that had five interview comments and
standards-based ULO’s” that had eight interview comments. It was very clear from the
transcripts that the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) were
used by instructors either singly, alongside the Association of College and Research

303

Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) or combined
with the Value Rubrics and other subject specific standards. Two institutions had
undergraduate learning outcomes that cemented the ACRL Standards (2000) as the rule
to follow, and both these colleges were not interested in implementing the Association of
College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016) in the near future, because they had spent several years working with
their general education requirements committees to adopt the latter and did not want to
make any changes.
“I feel like our university level learning outcome for information literacy was
based on the old ACRL Standards. As well as pretty much most of the course level
outcome for information literacy. So really, we pretty much, I feel like, we are
using for the most part of the old standards, but that is because our university
adopted them as using them as actual learning outcomes…we can’t really just like
deviate from them then and start using the new Framework…we already have
learning outcomes.”
Most instructors that had not used the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000) to create concrete undergraduate learning outcomes appeared to have a
love-hate relationship with the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards.
Some claimed that the Standards were too rigid in application, but others indicated they
actually did provide instructors with a firm foundation on which to build their classes and
make them ready for application for the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework (2016). As one instructor commented:

304

“I never sort of really liked to use the Standards as sort of tick marks that you
have to check off, I just never liked that…it basically…served as a firm sort of
foundation onto which to build.”
Theme: Guidelines and Non-Application
The “Guidelines” theme had one sub-theme, “informed thinking” which had eight
interview comments coded to it. According to the transcript analysis, although most
librarians were moving toward implementing the Association of College and Research
Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) in some form
or other in their instruction, there were still those who stated that the old Association of
College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) were still vital. This was because their
libraries had not moved away at any time from teaching basic skills to their students,
whether they were freshmen or seniors. They saw them as critical skills that students had
to master as one instructor emphasized during his/her interview:
“The Standards are more you know they’re skill based. The finding, evaluating,
assessing, citing but then I think you know we still need some of those critical
skills in our you know especially among the freshmen classes, we’re still gonna
need to address those.”
Librarians also thought in most cases, except for where the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000) had become undergraduate learning outcomes, just
as they did about the new Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016), that the Standards (2000) were in fact
to be considered as guidelines for their instruction and that they could not be considered
to be inflexible or set in stone:

305

“I think we use them only as a kind of a backdrop or a place or sort of a
touchpoint and I think some of it is related to the fact of how very old our
information literacy program is at xxxxx it started so far before those standards
and it’s like if we’re grown parallel ways and we don’t ignore the standards or
anything but we also don’t, you know…use them, I don’t know as a real firm
guideline as far as I’m concerned.”
There were always those information literacy instructors who did not apply either the
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) or the Association of
College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016) simply because they did not believe that either were “…meant to be a
blanket or to be wholly adopted in the same way.” They strongly believed in the need for
librarians to use both as touch points that generated ideas and allowed librarians to be
creative and adapt these guidelines as they saw fit in the classroom setting where their
work with their students was unique.
The “non-application” theme meant that instruction librarians were making no
attempt at applying the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) in their presentations to students at
their college, had one sub-theme “no formal adoption” had eight interview comments
coded to it. The “no formal adoption” theme indicated there was no formal adoption at
their institution of any ACRL Standards. Instead, instructors were teaching what they
believed as practicing librarians they followed the research, but did not adopt any formal
standards. They taught students what they needed to know in order to write their papers
and pass their courses.

306

Theme: General Education Program
The “General Education Program” theme had 12 interview comments coded to it
and was broken down into three sub-themes, the undergraduate learning outcomes which
had four interview comments coded to it, the “Cultivation of the Student Scholar” which
had five interview comments coded to it and the “First Year Experience” which had three
interview comments coded to it.
It was found that the general education programs of each of the eight schools were
central to their information literacy programs and how they were developed and
organized, how the undergraduate learning outcomes that were often created in
collaboration with the faculty were developed and the format of the classes offered
through the program e.g. how exactly information literacy was integrated into the
institution’s First Year Experience and also into the majors. The “Undergraduate
Learning Outcomes” were defined one instruction librarian as:
“The learning outcomes that we’ve crafted for any undergraduate in any
program will achieve for any undergraduate or any program…the undergraduate
learning outcomes refers to engaging in critical thinking and making use of
information and that is something that we definitely hang our hat on…so those
are the outcomes…we’ve crafted as a unit and it is meaningful to us.”
During the “First Year Experience” it was common for the instruction librarians to
integrate the AAC&U Value Rubrics (American Association of Colleges and
Universities, 2017) into their outcomes as they taught critical thinking, inquiry and
information literacy skills to their freshmen. Regarding the “First Year Experience”, two
institutions were very articulate about the inclusion of the cultivation “of the student

307

scholar” as being a part of their teaching. Relating to their program one instruction
librarian pointed out:
“Because we’ve seen indications of research about you know that students need
to feel part of a community, they need to feel part of their university community in
order to fully engage with the learning environment and so we found that we work
with students and say their first year seminar course that we do in their new year,
two week section on that’s related to college level research, we don’t focus on
specific skills like clear –cut databases. Instead we talk about how the universities
organized and why students pick their major and then how scholars can, in the
social sciences, how they do research or how they ask questions or how to answer
questions.”

Teaching the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016) in the classroom
The Table 4.16 is a representation of five activities that instructors from all eight
institutions taught in the classrooms when applying both the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000) and Association of College and Research Libraries
the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) frames. Instructors
already applying the Framework concepts were interested in having their students
participate in a new assessment that had been created by Project SAILS for the
assessment of the frames, called the Threshold Assessment Test for Information Literacy
(TATL). The assessment was still in development and institutions were asked to
participate in field-testing in relation to one of the frames.

activities were a means of professional development and training to prepare to apply the
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016) in some format in the classroom setting. They were also
participating in discussion groups at their institutions regarding the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and how concepts relating to it would
be taught. Instructors stated that they were already applying threshold concepts from the
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) such as identifying the
stumbling-blocks that their students were experiencing when learning information
literacy concepts and then applying creativity to their teaching sessions to teach their
students, as one instructor explained:
“I’ve worked with a faculty member in biology for gosh, I guess fifteen years and
we have fine-tuned what we call a running bibliography project, which is in a
Microbiology class which is really about the process of questioning and letting
questions direct where you’re going, and I think because it’s like so many times I
go to get an answer I think that the Framework allows us to think more creatively
along those lines in terms of questions, so I think it’s gonna be a big help to us.”
Summary
The research question posed was: How do exemplary four-year college library
information literacy courses implement the Association of College and Research
Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)?

310

When analyzing Question 2 interviews, a total number of 102 interview
comments were coded and seven themes emerged. These were: The Association of
College and Research Libraries Framework (2016), The Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000), Combination, Guidelines, Non-Application,
General Education Program, and Rubrics & Additional Standards. There were 23 subthemes organized under the seven themes.
Major findings suggest that instruction librarians at six of the eight Association of
College and Research Libraries exemplary libraries studied where the ACRL Standards
(2000) had not been hardcoded into their undergraduate learning outcomes were
implementing the ACRL Framework (2016) concepts in their information literacy
classes. Librarians were participating in this implementation for two reasons, either they
had pre-empted the Framework concepts and were already teaching those concepts in
their information literacy courses prior to the release of the ACRL Framework (2016), or
they were open and willing to experiment with the Framework (2016) and its frames.
Some instruction librarians were using both the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) and the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework (2016) as well as other Standards from different disciplines together to meet
their unique learning outcomes. The Framework (2016) critics who had realized the
importance of the new Framework (2016), not only because they had pre-empted the
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and were already
applying the concepts the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education
(2016), but they already had created their own unique undergraduate learning outcomes
that were very similar to the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education

311

(2016) concepts. They were willing to test their own undergraduate learning outcomes
unique to their institution by having their students take the Threshold Achievement Test
for Information Literacy (TATIL) that had just been created in 2015 by Project SAILS
(2016) as a means of assessing each of the frames of the Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016). Instructors were also combining specific parts of
the ACRL Standards (2000) and the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016) and were as one instructor suggested moving towards a combination or
hybridization of the two guidelines when students received their instruction. Library
instructors were also candid about not only the hybridization of the ACRL Standards
(2000) and the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) but also
about including other rubrics in the mix because they believed that “personalization” was
important to how they taught their classes.

Research Question 3

The research question asked: How do exemplary four-year colleges and
universities implement digital literacy and the six frames of the Association of College
and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education
(2016)?
The purpose of the study is to better understand how exemplary four-year
institutions implement both technology and digital literacy and how the six frames of the
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016) were used in their courses.

312

Question 3’s interviews were coded by hand using bottom-up coding. The
Question 3 Themes and Sub-Themes can be viewed below in Table 4.9. An analysis of
participant transcripts provided 85 coded interview comments from their responses to this
question. Five major themes and 27 sub-themes were identified during coding. The five
major themes were: the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016), the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000), Undergraduate Learning Outcomes, Teaching
Methods and Approaches and Teaching Digital Literacy.

Question 3: Themes and Sub-Themes
The Question 3 Themes and Sub-Themes are listed in Table 4.17. The total
number of interview comments coded to answer Question 3 was 85. There were five
major themes: Teaching Methods and Approaches Decisions with 30 interview comments
coded to it, the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) with 20
interview comments coded to it, the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) with 18 interview
comments coded to it, Teaching Digital Literacy with 15 interview comments coded to it,
and Undergraduate Learning Outcomes with one unit coded to it. Decisions made relating
to what was taught in the information literacy courses that were designed at each of the
eight exemplary colleges and universities were directly related to how information
literacy was integrated into the general education program at that specific college or
university and to the outcomes that were created by instruction librarians in collaboration
with the faculty. At all eight institutions information literacy was integrated both at the
First Year Seminar or Experience level, where freshmen participated in a variety of

313

different types of instruction and then also at the level of the major. In six of the eight
colleges, the best features of the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards
(2000) and the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) were
being adapted so that these would meet the unique outcomes of each of these institutions

At the institutions where the general education program committees or boards had
been persuaded to adopt the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards
(2000) as undergraduate learning outcomes (to which one unit was coded), and this was
the case for two colleges out of the eight. There was an unwillingness on the part of these
librarians to move away from the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000) and adopt the Framework (2016), since it had taken years of hard work
to attain the integration of the latter. This was made clear when a participant stated
referring to integrating or adopting the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) in their information
literacy courses:
“We won’t be using it to reframe our outcomes because our learning outcomes
are tied to our university learning outcomes. So that’s really important to us to be
in line with what’s happening at our local institution.”
Along similar lines another participant pointed out that the libraries creating
information literacy programs were not been relying on the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000) or the Association of College and Research
Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) for the
creation of their learning outcomes. Instead, they have used three AAC&U Rubrics
(American Association of Colleges and Universities, 2017) as standards and had tweaked
those to meet their institution’s unique outcomes. Here is what an instruction librarian
from a different college said:
“Our university’s learning outcomes were developed with reference to the ACRL
2000 Standards but they also were impacted by a lot of other things especially the

316

AAC& U Value Rubrics and Leap Learning Outcomes. So our university learning
outcome of critical thinking and inquiry is most closely related to the AAC& U
definitions for critical thinking and inquiry and information literacy and so that’s
really the basis of our instruction program rather than anything that came from
ACRL.”
Exploring what instructors thought about moving toward implementing the Framework,
under the “Application & Alignment” sub-theme an instructor explained that
“We try to throw in these higher-level learning concepts when it makes sense to
do…we did it a little bit in our tutorial for our first year seminar students, we did
through in a little section about the scholarly conversation and we changed our
types of information section to move away from focusing on format and more just
focusing on like what kind of information it is, so we did make little tweaks here
and there to try to incorporate the concepts from the frameworks a little bit
more.”
Information literacy instructors were also combining specific parts of the ACRL
Standards (2000) and the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and were as one instruction suggested
moving towards a combination or hybridization of the two guidelines when students
received their instruction. The sub-theme “Hybrid” had two interview comments coded to
it, because the instructors were already commenting on this happening in their classrooms
and one suggested:
“You know in the future as we go further away from the Framework
implementation we’re gonna see more of this hybrid, I feel, of the two, you know

317

‘cause a lot of schools have invested time into that original document and it’s
kind of hard to just midstream tell everyone to just dump it.”
Instructors were candid about not only the hybridization of the ACRL Standards (2000)
and the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) but also about
including other rubrics in the mix. They believed that “personalization” which was a subtheme under the major “Combination” theme and to which eight interview comments
were coded, was important since their institutions promoted a high level of academic
freedom and instructors and faculty collaboratively chose and applied educational
approaches that best suited their presentations within the major. As an instruction
explained:
“You know there’s a lot of personalization taking what the standards are and
applying it to how it relates to our program, that’s exactly what we’re doing and
different libraries faculty will approach it in a different way and that’s the
freedom that they have in terms of their faculty status.”
It was also later pointed out in the same vein that:
“You know one of the best practices was about encouraging and allowing a lot of
different pedagogic approaches and I think that would be true for us though. I
think that you know within a large distributed environment like ours people take
on a lot of different theoretical approaches and so some of those theoretical
approaches which probably align with disciplines they’re working with you know
they bring to there.”

318

Themes: The Association of College and Research Libraries Framework (2016)
The Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016) theme was divided into three sub-themes: the six

frames, “Integration & Incorporation” and “not taught.” This major theme had 18
interview comments coded to it. The six frames sub-theme had 12 interview comments
coded to it while the integration & incorporation sub-theme had three interview
comments coded to it and the “Not Taught” sub-theme had three interview comments
coded to it. Around the major theme, the instruction librarians at six of the exemplary
universities have an interest in the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and have applied specific
frames, but never all six frames at any of the universities. One of the problems with the
in-depth application of the six frames is that all the universities participate in information
literacy integrations into their general education programs that require the instructors
from the library to present one-shot presentations, online tutorials or otherwise be
embedded in specific courses. As a result, they did not have time to use all six frames of
the framework in their presentations, but tended to favor specific frames over others, the
two most popular being “Scholarship as Conversation” and “Authority is Contextual.”
“Yeah definitely of the Framework the six frames, we’re doing most of them,
we’re doing them through research process as inquiry, it’s observing the world
around them and then asking questions to find possible solutions. We’re definitely
doing scholarship as conversation where they’re now part of the community of
student scholars…We’ve talked about authority, especially introducing them to
what it means to be a college student and why professors who are experts in their
fields are asking them to use scholarly research…”
319

In comparison there were also instruction librarians at other colleges that were concerned
about the expectation that they had to include the Association of College and Research
Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and the six frames
when they were presenting an information literacy class. In response to being asked
whether the six frames were being taught in any way through technology, the instruction
librarian responded:
“Not really, and part of that too is because I don’t necessarily approach
information literacy instruction by saying “I must teach all students these six
frames…you know we don’t teach one and two credit information literacy courses
there.”
On the other hand, there were librarians who were still very unsure of whether or not to
integrate or incorporate the frames from the Framework into their information literacy
classes, because as one librarian stated:
“We consider the standards till viable standards, whereas the Framework is kind
of a meta-looker it’s kind of a big brother topics and a Framework really so that
you can pin the Standards on it. We have been taking a cautious approach, we
haven’t been doing a lot…we haven’t really formally done anything yet with those
Framework thing, although really it comes into conversation when we are
planning you know the curriculum and what we’re going to be doing next because
it’s important for students to see that bigger picture.”
The “Integration & Incorporation” theme related directly to instructor’s comments from
the eight exemplary information literacy programs regarding their interest in a current or
future integration and incorporation of the Association of College and Research Libraries

320

Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) into their information
literacy course structures.
“I have been meeting with professors in our Geography Department because
they have gone through a program review and so we are re-thinking how we are
incorporating information literacy into that particular major and so I sent them, I
took the ACRL Framework and so I summarized, made it three pages long instead
of eighteen page…so we looked at the Framework and we’re actually
incorporating it differently and they’re very excited…”
The Table 4.18 represents assignments that library instructors have taught at the eight
exemplary information literacy programs studied, using the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and
the six frames. The table was organized into two columns, Themes related to the
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016) and assignments and activities that have been organized in
instructor’s information literacy classes around the Framework for Information Literacy
for Higher Education (2016). The two most common frames were “Authority is
Constructed” and “Scholarship as Conversation” and explained that they taught the
frames that applied to the instruction they were providing, so if they were teaching about
authority then they chose “Authority is Constructed.” Instructors provided six examples
of assignments and activities that they had used in their information literacy classes over
the past few months, since the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework
(2016) was in flux. Librarians pointed out that they did not feel that they “must teach all
frames” to all students. They were more apt to teach one or two of the frames, or frames

321

that uniquely fit their instruction topic or highlighted it in some way. They did not feel
that they needed to be compelled to teach all of the six frames in their classes, nor did
they believe that they had to teach the six frames of the Framework (2016) to their
students at all. Just like with the ACRL Standards (2000), they considered the Framework
(20160) to be a guideline for instruction which would serve to inform their own
information literacy practice, and not as a given or a rule by which they needed to instruct
their students.

Theme: The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000)
The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) had 22
interview comments of coding and only one sub-theme to which all the coding was
connected, “Tool Literacy.”
Interview findings suggested that the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) were still very heavily applied across all eight exemplary
institutions, whether or not they had chosen to mix the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000) with rubrics and the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) or
additional Standards from other disciplines. Every instruction librarian considered it
necessary to teach their students the information literacy fundamentals, such as being
able to use the library catalog, search the databases and use the library tools that were
available to both freshmen and students in the majors, in order to do research effectively.
As one library instruction librarian states:
“We’re pretty much using the library resources so our library website…our
integrated search and then our different databases, we’re pretty much, that’s
what we’re teaching students how to use…so we really focus on how to find
information and then how to evaluate it and then sort of that phase of
production…”
Theme: Teaching Methods and Approaches
Two major themes were identified during the coding of the questions posed
related to Question 3; they were “Teaching Methods” and “Approaches.” Thirty total
interview comments were coded in association with the “Teaching Methods” theme and
324

out of these, four interview comments were coded in association with two specific
“Teaching Approaches” thematically identified as the “Anti–Technology Approach” and
“Coding Not Taught” approaches. Twenty-six interview comments were divided across
15 subsidiary sub-themes related to the manner in which students were being taught at the
eight institutions in the study.
The instructors interviewed during the study collaborated with their institutional
faculty to present information literacy instruction classes to their students in thirteen
different formats. Eighty percent of the 13 formats identified were online formats, and
20% were face-to-face formats. Thus the most common online formats information
literacy instructors were using to teach and transfer information literacy content were:
videos on different information literacy topics, Ipad instruction, online tutorials, blended
courses, course module development, embedded librarians, LibGuides, utilizing media
and social media platforms, online discussion groups, and chat reference. In face-to-face
classes, librarians used discussion groups in their teaching. In two institutions librarians
developed presentations in different formats that cultivated the student scholar. This was
done by developing the freshman identity as not only to become an active member of the
university community, but also as a student scholar, as described by a librarian during
interviews who said:
“We are so focused on helping students understand the idea of being a student
scholar and being part of an academic community, it doesn’t leave a lot of room
for kind of information literacy and a lot of other areas of your life, like digital
literacy, digital citizenship, media literacy.”

325

Since the majority of the institutions in the study had large student populations, it made
sense that often the librarians were dependent on technology to make their information
literacy instruction sessions with their students work, since online tutorials and
embedding which was commonly used, required technology. As one librarian pointed
out:
“How do you ensure that happens when you’re at 25,000 students and which is
not to say that the connection cannot happen but technology, it can sometimes
actually be facilitated by technology. For example, a chat restaurant is extremely
popular with students and we have very rich interactions with students and chat
reference.”
The second theme, teaching approaches was specifically related to how technology was
being taught at the eight exemplary institutions studied. The teaching approaches theme
had two sub-themes, the “anti-technology approach” and a “do not teach coding”
approach. For information literacy instructors, who felt teaching was tool literacy
focused, also tended to have less interest in teaching technology. One librarian stated
that:
“I think it’s not so much how would you use technology, but the, but how would
you thoughtfully employ technology when needed...I reject the notion that
technology is always the answer…what needs to be cultivated more…is the
understanding that there are times technology is the absolute tool to
use…understand when technology is not the most important thing…where is
technology inappropriate? Where does technology get in the way, where is it an
obstacle?”

326

Theme: Digital Literacy
The teaching digital literacy theme had eight sub-themes and 15 total interview
comments coded to it. These themes and sub-themes are described in Table 4.19. The
digital literacy sub-themes were: The eight sub-themes were related to the actual teaching
of digital literacy as part of information literacy instruction. These were as follows:
“Teaching Metaliteracy” which had three interview comments, “Teaching Metadata”
which had one interview comment, “Teaching Data Management and Data Literacy”
which had two interview comments, “No Separation between Information Literacy and
Digital Literacy” which had one interview comment. “Not Teaching Digital Literacy” at
all such as: “No Effort included in Teaching Digital Literacy” had two interview
comments and “No Course Outcomes” so that digital literacy cannot be taught had one
interview comment and “Technology Integrated in What We Teach” which had two
interview comments. Since there were librarians who believed that everything they taught
to their students included technology in some form or other, “Students Expected To Use
Technology” (which had three interview comments), meant that there were librarians
who believed that students came to college with technology skills and know-how. As a
result of the latter, they did not specifically need to teach students how to use technology
in their classes, thus “Technology Integrated” had two interview comments.

As one librarian stated during their interview regarding how librarians viewed the topic
of students and technology:
“Well, the technology is pretty well integrated, very much integrated into all of
our information literacy and it’s…all of our classrooms are… have 25 work
computer workstations so whatever we teach it…so we integrate the technology
with it…the students are expected to be technology…they are expected to have a
certain level of technology, and if not then we try to give them the tools to get up
to that speed and even in our regular single sessions our classes.”
Library instructors participating in the interviews were very articulate about whether or
not they were actually teaching digital literacy in their information literacy classes. As
one librarian stated:
“Oh we’re using…in digital literacy we’re teaching it and then we’re also
walking the walk, we’re not just talking, talking about it…we’re teaching we’re
using a variety of media and a different variety of sources as well.”
While another instruction librarian stated that there is really no separating information
literacy from digital literacy because digital literacy was much more than just teaching
students how to use technology:
“You know dealing with the digital world and the information created digitally is
so much a part of…it’s almost…you can’t you can’t separate information literacy
from digital literacy and in some ways I guess it depends on how far you go in
defining digital literacy and how narrow you are because for example like I told
you for example I don’t necessarily talk about I don’t necessarily teach about you

329

know like different field formats not all the time, but I do… technology
workshops…I do talk about things like metadata.”
Table 4.20 describes activities that information literacy instructors at the eight exemplary
institutions suggested they did when teaching technology and/or digital literacy to their
students. The table is divided into instruction done with freshman and then also with
students receiving information literacy instruction in the major. Instructors shared eleven
activities that they used in the classroom with their students related to enhancing digital
literacy skills.

Digital Literacy Discussion
Instructors at various institutions explained how they taught digital literacy in
the classroom. Instructors made use of the frame “Scholarship is a Conversation” when
teaching their students about media and mass media and how each could be used as
scholarly resources. Students had discussions about how to find and use media resources
and mass media e.g. news clips, videos, and other types of digital media such as podcasts
in their scholarly pursuits. Students learned how to use free citation creation tools
available on the web and research and analysis tools such as Zotero to gather and
organize their citations. Students were also directed to the archival repositories owned by
their institutions and encouraged not only to submit their undergraduate research to these
repositories but also to be able to read archival records and metadata, so that they could
find useful information for papers they were required to write while still taking general
education courses. Instructors were also teaching their undergraduate students how to use
analyze qualitative and quantitative data, preparing them to become student-scholars that
were ready to become researchers once they had finished their first degree.
Instructors also used information literacy games such as RADAR (created by
one of the institutions included in this study). Radar is a challenge game that teaches
students how to evaluate sources. For the in-class exercise, the class is given a topic e.g.
Government Regulation and Fracking, and students work in teams. They have to choose
between a scholarly, popular and trade publication for their research article and vote on
which one to choose for writing their scholarly paper.
“When they have finished answering all the questions, they write their team name
and score on the whiteboard and the winning team can sometimes get a

332

prize...this activity would also pair well with an exercise/discussion on the
differences and similarities between academic sources and credible sources.”
When teaching undergraduate students how to research, instructors chose unique topics
that were of interest to students and that would get them to participate in the research
conversation. Subject choices such as graffiti, allowed the instruction librarian to not only
show students where to find articles about the topic, but also directed students to find
blogs by graffiti artists and interviews about these artists that provided them with many
different types of digital sources. The students could use these resources to analyze the
topic, and gather additional topic ideas from using digital resources such as blogs and
interviews when researching their own subject areas.
Instructors also stated that when teaching in the disciplines and collaborating
with subject-faculty, they worked with seniors to complete projects, which were often
graded by professors in the majors. However, librarians were often embedded or did
different types of presentations to help seniors find the resources they needed for projects
in the majors and subject library-liaisons often did one-on-one consultations with these
students, providing direction for the successful completion of these projects.

Research Questions 1-3 Word Cloud
French qualitative researchers at the University of Provence and the University of
Montpelier, Gambette & Veronis (2009) in Visualising a text with a word cloud defined
word clouds as representations built directly from text using word frequencies, after
getting rid of stop words, to be able to display words in a co-occurrence relationship.
University of Bath qualitative researchers, Ramsden & Bate (2008), similarly stated that
word clouds were "visual depiction of words” and that “the more frequent the word”

333

appeared “within the text being analyzed the larger the word” ( p.1.) became when it was
represented in a word cloud chart.
The Fig. 4.6 Eight University Word Cloud was created in NVIVO 11 Plus
representing the Question 1 five question survey responses from the 23 participant
transcriptions and from eight universities in the study. The limits set were the Word
Cloud default limits in Nvivo 11 Plus, that included a word frequency of 1,000 and a
minimum word length of three letters.
It is interesting to note that all the words in the word cloud connects to the largest
and most central word in the word cloud: “Information,” as information or the search for
information is central to the information literacy process. The second word that is central
to the word cloud is “know.” This word directly relates to knowledge that is a concept
also involved in the information literacy search process. We must find “information” and
gather “knowledge” before there can be any analysis and interpretation that might then
lead the student toward the creation of new “knowledge.”
Three more important concepts: “program,” “students,” and “literacy” are also
included in the center of the word cloud. These three words are of definite significance to
the information literacy process because the “program” at each of the universities in the
study is created for “students” to develop their “literacy” skills as freshman and
upperclass majors where information literacy is integrated into their subject-specific
courses. Four additional words were course, library, learning, and online. All of these
words connect with the first question of how information literacy courses are developed
for students at each institution and how the library and online learning connects with
student learning.

334

Figure 4.6
Question 1 Eight University Word Cloud

Word clouds were also constructed in NVIVO 11 Plus for each of the sets of
interviews representing each of the eight colleges and universities in the study. These can
be found in Appendix L. These word clouds are very different from one another, and
represent teacher-librarian approaches to information literacy. If the words at the core and
around in the cloud are examined, the researcher found that libraries less focused on
student-centered learning and outcomes and more on administrative information literacy
stood out. In comparison those with more student-centered approaches to information
literacy had word clouds that included word choices that emphasized the importance of
the students and student activities during their interviews.

335

Summary
The research question posed was: How do exemplary four-year colleges and

universities implement digital literacy and the six frames of the Association of College
and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education
(2016)?
For Question 3, an analysis of participant interviews provided a total of 85
interview comments from their responses. Five major themes and 27 sub-themes were
identified during coding. The five major themes were: the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework, the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000), Undergraduate Learning Outcomes, Teaching Methods and
Approaches and Teaching Digital Literacy.
The major findings were that in two of the eight institutions studied, the
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) was not taught. In six
of eight institutions studied, the six frames were never taught in their entirety. Instructors
chose to teach specific frames when they fit the instructional theme. They suggested that
since they taught large student bodies, it was not possible to teach all six frames when
they had to follow their learning outcomes and had many topics to cover and limited
instruction hours to do so.
Technology was considered to be integrated into information literacy, since some
librarians believed that you could not separate digital literacy from information literacy.
There were also those who said that they did not teach digital literacy because of the time
constraints they had with teaching their undergraduate students.
When information literacy and ultimately digital literacy were taught, librarians
suggested that their students were being taught much more than just how to search
336

Google, use the databases and find periodical articles. They were being taught more than
just how to use a computer mouse or how to master specific computer programs. They
were being taught about information ethics, anti-plagiarism and how to understand the
legal, social and political issues that were connected with their daily and long-term
Internet and computer use.

Chapter Summary

Three questions were asked and answered in this chapter. Twenty-three
interviews were conducted with instruction librarians from eight institutions. The
interviews were transcribed and analyzed.
Analyzing Question 1, the major themes that were directly related to the “General
Education Program” of which 396 coded interview comments were identified included:
174 interview comments related to “Strategic Planning,” 151 interview comments related
to “Administration,” and 144 interview comments related to “Assessment.”
The major findings were that the academic libraries in the study had their library
strategic plan aligned to the strategic plan of their institution often these plans included
the requirements of the college accrediting body, especially when there were
competencies such as information literacy proposed as best practices in area institutions.
Plans to create an information literacy course started with the institution and the library’s
strategic planning documents and mission statements, these documents were used as a
guide for how to start the course outcomes development and building process. When the
library’s strategic plan was developed, the library’s mission and vision were most often

337

in-line with that of the institution. Course goals and objectives were written that would
guide library programming. Information Literacy was often just one of several general
education undergraduate learning outcomes that were adopted and approved by general
education committees across campuses.
A total of 151 interview comments were coded from interviews to the major
“Administration” theme. The “Administration” theme had nine unique interview
comments coded to it, and two sub-themes Faculty” and “Librarians as teachers.” The
“Faculty” sub-theme had one subsidiary theme and a total of 65 interview comments
coded to it. Forty-five interview comments were coded to the “Faculty” sub-theme and
20 interview comments were coded to it the “Student Learning” theme. The “Librarians
as Teachers” sub-theme had five subsidiary themes and a total of 77 interview comments
coded to it. Twenty interview comments were coded to “Librarians as Teachers” subtheme, the “Collaboration” subsidiary theme had 12 interview comments coded it, the
“Liaison Program” subsidiary theme had 18 interview comments coded to it, the
“Professional development” subsidiary theme had 11 interview comments coded to it, the
“Reference Desk” subsidiary theme had 11 interview comments coded to it and the
“Researcher” subsidiary theme had five interview comments coded to it. The themes
with the most prominent interview comments in the “Administration,” were the “Faculty”
and the “Liaison Program” themes.
The major findings suggested that information literacy programs in institutions
were most successful when the library’s program was supported by the institution’s
administration. Successful information literacy course and program implementation in all
eight institutional settings were dependent on the collaborative arrangements made

338

between the instructional librarians and the faculty and the steps taken to integrate
information literacy into general education courses or the disciplines. In all the
institutions studied, instruction librarians were hired not only to instruct information
literacy classes but also to serve as subject liaison librarians to one or more divisions or
departments within the institution. It was the liaison librarian’s job to serve as a liaison
between the library and the subject division or department/ faculty and students. The
liaison librarian was also responsible for developing subject-specific library collections
and teaching students how to use the databases and resources that were related to the
subject they were majoring in.
One-hundred and eight interview comments were coded to this theme “Best
Practices in Information Literacy.” The six themes associated with the “Best practices in
information literacy” theme were “Reference” to which 17 interview comments were
coded to it, “Information Literacy Curriculum” to which 38 interview comments were
coded, “Information Literacy Models” to which eight interview comments were coded,
“Curriculum and Program Administration” to which 25 interview comments were coded,
“Information Literacy Assessment” to which six interview comments were coded and
“No Information Literacy Best Practices” to which two interview comments were coded.
Findings indicated that instruction librarians were using best practices in six areas
that directly related to the development and design of the information literacy course: in
their reference interactions with students, in choosing information literacy and teaching
and learning models that would fit their institution’s programs, in the development of
information literacy curriculum, in curriculum and program administration procedures
and in assessing their information literacy courses and programs.

339

The “Information Literate Students” theme was organized into 12 sub-themes.
One-hundred and four interview comments were coded to this theme. The twelve subthemes associated with the “Information Literate Students” theme were “Anecdotal
Evidence” to which 19 interview comments were coded, “No Measurements in Place” to
which 14 interview comments were coded. Further sub-themes include “Disciplines and
Majors” to which 14 interview comments were coded, “Rubrics” to which 14 interview
comments were coded and “Standardized Tests” to which 14 interview comments were
coded and General Education Outcomes to which 11 interview comments were coded.
Findings indicated that although there was a great deal of anecdotal evidence
provided by instructors that their students were information literate when they graduated
and that they were lifelong learners. No institutions had implemented tests for seniors that
determined whether they were graduating information literate.
The “Assessment” theme was organized into three sub-themes with a total
number of 144 coded interview comments. Sixty-three interview comments were coded
to the “Assessment” theme. The three sub-themes associated with the “Assessment”
theme were “Assignments” to which 39 interview comments were coded, “Rubrics” as
teachers to which 23 interview comments were coded and “Standardized Tests” to which
19 interview comments were coded. The three sub-themes were interconnected since they
were important to programmatic assessment.
Instructors in the study taught information literacy to their students in many
different formats, but in each, they provided the students with information literacy
assignments that were either completed prior to the class in the format of a tutorial, inclass or after the class and later used for assessment. Whether or not these assignments

340

were graded by the faculty teaching the course or whether these assignments were
collected so that course assessment could be completed, depended on the specific
collaboration the librarian had with the faculty member. Interview findings indicated that
standardized information literacy tests were less common at larger institutions because
librarians had to pay per student for test codes and also because larger institutions had
more staff and resources to create their own homegrown tests At the two smallest
colleges in the study where sequenced information literacy courses were taught on a
semester-basis, fixed-choice tests were administered by librarians to evaluate student
information literacy progress. Newer assessments were also developed by these smaller
colleges to determine how students were faring on their higher-level information literacy
skills.
The “Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000)” theme had
27 total interview comments. Twenty-five interview comments were coded to this theme.
This theme also had one sub-theme. “Pre-empted Standards” and three interview
comments were coded to that sub-theme.
Courses developed in programs across all eight institutions, emphasized tool
literacy elements that related back to the “Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000).” Tool literacy laid the foundation for student learning and also
provided them with the knowledge of how to find resources and use the library databases.
Tool literacy enabled student learners to master database content and extend their
investigations, thereby becoming “more self-directed” assuming “greater control over
their own learning” (ACRL Standards, 2000) and a better understand more complex
information literacy concepts.

341

Some institutions in the study embraced concepts and specific frames connected
to the Framework (2000) when building their course assignments and creating
information literacy databases, even though in some situations they had not changed their
course or program outcomes to include the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016). The Preempted
Framework theme showed that librarians were vigilant about any changes that were being
made to the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and were
aware that they already had implemented theory and process in their classrooms that were
associated with the new frames in the Framework (2016). Institutions having adapted the
Standards (2016) stated to their course outcomes suggested that they could not adopt an
un-vetted new Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) because
the Standards (2000) although not set in stone, were what their course-outcomes were
based upon.
Analyzing Question 2 interviews were coded by hand using emerging or bottomup coding. There was a total number of 102 interview comments were coded and seven
themes emerged. These were: “The Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)”, “The Association of
College and Research Libraries Standards (2000)”, “Combination, Guidelines”, “NonApplication”, “General Education Program”, and “Rubrics & Additional Standards”.
There were 23 sub-themes organized under the seven themes.
There were several instances in the interviews where instruction librarians
explained that they were already teaching the six frames and therefore applying their
knowledge of the Framework, it’s six frames and the related theory when teaching

342

students in the classroom. Instruction librarians at six of the eight Association of College
and Research Libraries exemplary libraries studied suggested that they were doing this
for two reasons, either they had pre-empted the Framework concepts and were already
teaching those concepts in their information literacy courses for several years prior to the
release of the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016). The other possibility was that librarians were they
were open and willing to experiment with the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016) and its frames and were using both the Standards and the
Framework and other Standards from different disciplines together to meet their unique
learning outcomes. Despite the negative views that abounded at some institutions
associated with implementing the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016), critics who had realized the importance of the new Framework (2016),
were already exploring specific frames in their own way. They were doing this not only
because they had pre-empted the Framework and were already applying the concepts the
Framework (2016) but they already had created their own unique undergraduate learning
outcomes that were very similar to the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016) concepts. Instructors were also combining specific parts of the
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016). One instructor suggested moving
towards a combination or hybridization of the two guidelines when students received
their instruction but also about including other rubrics in the mix because they believed
that “personalization” was important. There were also institutions suggesting that since
they promoted a high level of academic freedom and instructors and faculty

343

collaboratively chose and applied educational approaches that best suited their
presentations within the major.
“The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000)” theme had
29 coded interview comments, with three sub-themes, “Application and Alignment” that
had 16 interview comments, mechanistic/tool literacy that had five interview comments
and Standards-based Undergraduate Learning Outcomes” that had eight interview
comments. It was very clear from the transcripts that the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000) were used by instructors either singly, alongside the
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016) or combined with the Value Rubrics and other subject specific
Standards.
Course design at each of the eight exemplary colleges and universities was
directly related to how information literacy was integrated into the General Education
program at that specific college or university and to the outcomes that were created by
instruction librarians in collaboration with the faculty. At all eight institutions
information literacy was integrated both at the First Year Seminar or Experience level,
where freshmen participated in a variety of different types of instruction and then also at
the level of the major. In six of the eight colleges, the best features of the Association of
College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016) were being adapted so that these would meet the
unique outcomes of each of these institutions. At the institutions where the general
education program committees or boards had been persuaded to adopt the Standards
(2000) as undergraduate learning outcomes and this was the case for two colleges out of

344

the eight, there was an unwillingness on the part of these librarians to move away from
the Standards (2000) and adopt the Framework (2016), since it had taken years of hard
work to attain the integration of the latter.
The Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016) theme was divided into three sub-themes: the six
frames, “Integration and Incorporation” and “Not Taught.” This major theme had 18
interview comments coded to it. The six frames sub-theme had 12 interview comments
coded to it while the “Integration and Incorporation” sub-theme had three interview
comments coded to it and the not taught sub-theme had three interview comments coded
to it. Around the major theme, the instruction librarians at six of the exemplary
universities have an interest in the Framework (2016) and have applied specific frames,
but never all six frames at any of the universities. One of the problems with the in-depth
application of the six frames is that all the universities participate in information literacy
integrations into their general education programs that require the instructors from the
library to present one-shot presentations, online tutorials or otherwise be embedded in
specific courses. As a result, they did not have time to use all six frames of the
framework in their presentations, but tended to favor specific frames over others, the two
most popular being “Scholarship as Conversation” and “Authority is Contextual.”
The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) had 22
interview comments of coding and only one sub-theme to which all the coding was
connected, to the subsidiary theme was “Tool Literacy” (the ability to effectively use the
databases and other technology tools to find academic resources).

345

Interview findings suggested that the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) were still very heavily applied across all eight exemplary
institutions, whether or not they had chosen to mix the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000) with rubrics and the Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016) or additional standards from other disciplines.
Every instruction librarian considered it necessary to teach their students the information
literacy fundamentals, such as being able to use the library catalog, search the databases
and use the library tools that were available to both freshmen and students in the majors,
in order to do research effectively.
The Question 3 was: How do exemplary 4-year colleges and universities use
technology to support student digital literacy for each of the six frames of the ACRL
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)?
For Question 3, an analysis of participant interviews provided a total of 85
interview comments from their responses. Five major themes and 27 sub-themes were
identified during coding. The five major themes were: the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework, the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000), Undergraduate Learning Outcomes, Teaching Methods and
Approaches and Teaching Digital Literacy.
The major findings were that in two of the eight institutions studied, the
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) was not taught. In six
of eight institutions studied, the six frames were never taught in their entirety. Instructors
chose to teach specific frames when they fit the instructional theme. They suggested that
since they taught large student bodies, it was not possible to teach all six frames when

346

they had to follow their learning outcomes had many topics to cover and limited
instruction hours to do so.
Technology was considered to be integrated into information literacy, since some
librarians believed that you could not separate digital literacy from information literacy.
There were also those who said that they did not teach digital literacy because of the time
constraints they had with teaching their undergraduate students.
The teaching digital literacy theme had eight sub-themes and 15 total interview
comments coded to it. The digital literacy sub-themes were: The eight sub-themes were
divided into sub-themes related to the actual teaching of digital literacy as part of
information literacy instruction such as: “Teaching Metaliteracy,” “Teaching Metadata”,
“Teaching Data Management” and “Data Literacy not seeing the separation between
Information Literacy and Digital Literacy” to themes related “Not Teaching Digital
Literacy” at all such as: “No Effort included in Teaching Digital Literacy,” not in the
course outcomes so it cannot be taught. Two additional themes relating to the teaching of
technology and digital literacy were “Technology Integrated in what we Teach,” since
there were librarians who believed that everything they taught to their students included
technology in some form or other. Then there was “Students expected to use
Technology” meaning that there were librarians who believed that students came to
college with technology skills and know-how, and that as a result of the latter, they did
not specifically need to teach students how to use technology in their classes. Library
instructors participating in the interviews were very articulate about whether or not they
were actually teaching digital literacy in their information literacy classes. Findings were
that blended learning is a common occurrence across all eight exemplary institutions in

347

this study, although there are some universities who refused to acknowledge that they
were participating in blended learning during their teaching.
The most common use of blended instruction used was the online tutorial, where
the instructors had their freshmen prepare for their visit to the library by completing a
tutorial. Other libraries created a series of tutorials on different information literacy topics
that students had to complete. In only three of the largest universities, online information
literacy courses were being offered, but this is still not a common occurrence and most
information literacy classes at these large institutions are conducted as face to face oneshots with blended learning components. The most common blended learning
components used by instructors across the eight institutions in their blended information
literacy classes included the following: learning management system modules, open
education resources, servers, library webpages, broadcast classes at specific sites for
distance students, online tutorials and videos often loaded on a Youtube Channel or
elsewhere, embedded librarians, discussion boards, Libguides and guide on the side.
Word Clouds were also created using NVIVO 11 Plus to better understand the
information literacy themes that were important to each institution.
The Comparative Analysis included the analysis of the “Online Course” which
had 74 interview comments coded to it, was a sub-theme of the Information Literacy
Course which had 39 unique interview comments coded to it. The “Information Literacy
Course” sub-theme had one subsidiary theme, “Information Literacy Course Type”
having a total of 100 interview comments coded to it. The “Online Course” was listed as
one of four “Information Literacy Course Types” encountered during the study. Four out
of the eight institutions in the study offered online information literacy courses to their

348

students. The two smallest universities in the study did not offer online information
literacy courses but their courses offerings to students were blended since they included a
large amount of online-components such as online videos, interactive tutorials and online
information literacy games.
The findings for Questions 2 and 3 were described. The findings were that
blended learning was a common occurrence across all eight exemplary institutions in this
study, although there are some universities who refused to acknowledge that they were
participating in blended learning during their teaching.

Chapter 5 - Conclusions and Recommendations

Restatement of Research Questions

The research questions relating to the development of information literacy courses
in exemplary colleges and universities in the United States are as follows:
1. How are selected four-year colleges implementing exemplary information literacy
courses?
2. How do exemplary four-year college library information literacy courses implement
the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy in Higher Education (2016)?
3. How do exemplary four-year colleges and universities implement digital literacy and
the six frames of the Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016)?

Obstacles related to the Study

A major problem with this study was the small number of librarians that were
interviewed at each institution to answer the questions posed. Only three librarians were
interviewed at seven institutions and two at an eighth. Although attempts were made to
interview librarians participating at different levels in an information literacy program at
their institutions e.g. writing instructors, outreach librarians etc., the researcher also
attempted to include information literacy program administrators in interviews, and a few
of the library administrator as participants. These library administrator participants were
350

functioning at a level way above the institution’s information literacy program, where
they had high level supervisory oversight over the program, but less direct involvement
with the program specifics in some cases. In two cases, administrator roles were merely
fiscal or being responsible to provide librarians in the programs with necessary
connections to other campus administrators and to additional staffing and services that
were needed to make their programs run successfully. On a few occasions during
interviews, the researcher found that it was not easy for these administrators to answer all
the questions posed to them, since they had no idea of the details that were requested
regarding the program they administered. Instead, when they did not have answers to the
questions that were asked, many of these were being referred back to middle managers
that the researcher had no access to because they were not part of the study or otherwise
to program managers who were being interviewed because they had a better grip on the
information literacy program planning and organization and understand the complexities
and dynamics of their programs.
A major obstacle was that each of the eight institutions in the study was unique.
There were similarities in how instruction was organized and how it was provided to
students, but there were differences among colleges to make comparisons between
colleges extremely difficult and complex. Another concern focused on the rate that each
exemplary college was progressing, and at the rate at which changes were occurring with
implementing the Framework (2016), much would have changed in the programs of each
college in the study by the time this dissertation was completed.

351

Benefits related to the Study

One of the benefits of the studying the problem was that Association of College
and Research Libraries Institute for Information Literacy (2003) that had developed
criteria for assessing information literacy programs, identified model programs that
exemplified significant achievement of the criteria and distribute information on the
criteria and model programs that exemplified successful information literacy
implementation criteria. Although the Best Practices Initiative of the Institute for
Information Literacy Program (ACRL, 2006) was already dated and abandoned after
reaching their project goals in 2006, the list of institutions and contacts still provided the
researcher with a definite research opportunity. The institutions in the study were renown
because they were identified as exemplary. They had spent time developing their
information literacy programs and these in turn had made a difference to their students’
lives. Exposure to information literacy had changed student interactions in the scholarly
environment and their efforts were discussed in the literature. From this vantage point, a
study was constructed that explored not only how these institutions had continued to
grow and develop their programs, since becoming “exemplary” but also how they were
redesigning and reorganizing their programs within their institutions, in order to remain
on the cutting edge. In addition, there was also the opportunity to explore how librarians
applied the ACRL Standards (2000) and the Framework (2016), which at that time had
not yet been vetted additional questions were asked about how digital literacy and also
whether or not students were actually information literate at graduation.
Another benefit of studying the problem was encountering librarian uncertainty
when the question was asked “Are your students information literate when they
352

graduate?” The unspoken expectation that students who had attended a ‘documented’
institution with an exemplary information literacy program would definitely be
information literate at graduation was considered to be a given. As a result, librarian
reactions to this question was totally unexpected and it was a surprise to find that even
though these librarians had developed their program outcomes and were assessing them,
the expected outcome that their students would be information literate at graduation was
never a given. Maybe this was not so shocking, since the definition of information
literacy has changed significantly from when the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) were applied, where students were merely taught tool literacy,
to where the Framework (2016) now “elevated the importance of” student “dispositions”
and “habits of mind” in “developing their information literate abilities” that would allow
them to become information users, creators and consumers (Burkhardt, 2014).
Another benefit of the study was being provided with opportunity to destroy supposition.
The researcher’s flawed and unfounded initial suppositions when putting the study
questions together were because the exemplary colleges in the study were large, they
would automatically have to have an online information literacy programs. Also, the
researcher’s bias that one-shots were an outdated concept and that large institutions had
moved away from this practice, were definitely refuted once interviews were conducted
and analyzed.

353

Summary of Study Findings for Question 1: How are selected four-year colleges
implementing exemplary information literacy courses?

Analyzing Question 1, the ten major themes analyzed were the (1)“General
Education Program,” (2) “Strategic Planning,” (3) “Administration,” (4) “Assessment,”
(5)“Best Practices in Information Literacy,” (6)“Information Literacy Curriculum,” (7)
“Information Literate Students,” (8)“Association of College and Research Libraries

Standards (2000)” , and (9)“the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework.”
Major findings were as follows:


Academic libraries in the study aligned their mission, vision and strategic plans with
those of their institutions using these to guide course outcome creation and development.



Librarians, administrators and faculty worked on and outside general education and
faculty committees as a team crafting information literacy course outcomes central to the
development of information literacy course/program.



Information literacy courses were created in collaboration with the faculty and were
adopted and approved by general education committees across campuses and set for
assessment on a two-year cycle.



Information literacy programs in institutions were most successful when the library’s
program was supported by the institution’s administration and when librarians and
faculty partnered to develop course content and integrate it into general education and
courses in the disciplines.

354



In all the institutions studied, instruction librarians were hired not only to instruct
information literacy classes but also to serve as subject liaison librarians to one or more
divisions or departments within the institution.



Liaison-librarians served as liaisons between the library and subject divisions or
department and their faculty and students, developing subject-specific library collections,
taught and assessed subject-specific information literacy classes for their divisions and in
some situations co-taught in the department with other subject faculty.



Instruction librarians were using best practices in six areas directly related to the
development and design of the information literacy course: in their reference interactions
with students, in choosing information literacy and teaching and learning models that
would fit their institution’s programs, in the development of information literacy
curriculum, in curriculum and program administration procedures and in assessing their
information literacy courses and programs.



Instruction librarians in the study worked alongside their institution’s assessment offices
or departments and received help to correctly assess their course and programmatic
information literacy assessment projects. Interview findings indicated that standardized
information literacy tests were less common at larger institutions than homegrown tests.



Instructors in the study taught information literacy to their students in many different
formats: on-shots, for-credit or not for-credit courses and embedded courses. The
majority of information literacy courses were taught face-to-face and blended using
online components and tutorials.



One hundred random papers were then collected for that assignment and marked using an
AAC&U information literacy rubric that was tweaked to meet the unique outcomes of the

355

program. The rubric was used to determine whether or not the students completing the
assignment, had met the course outcomes set for the class.


Courses developed in programs across all eight institutions emphasized tool literacy
elements which related back to the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000) enabling student learners to master database content and extend their
investigations, thereby becoming “more self-directed” assuming “greater control over
their own learning” (ACRL Standards, 2000).



Librarians across eight institutions discussed the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016) amongst themselves and embraced concepts and specific frames
connected to the Framework (2000) when building their course assignments even though
in some situations they had not changed their course or program outcomes.



The “Pre-empted Framework” theme showed that librarians were vigilant about any
changes that were being made to the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000) and were aware that they already had implemented theory and process
in their classrooms that were associated with the new frames in the Framework (2016).



Although there was a great deal of anecdotal evidence that instructors provided that their
students were information literate when they graduated, and that they were lifelong
learners, no institutions had implemented tests for seniors that determined whether they
were graduating information literate.
Discussion: Research Question 1
Key discussion points associated with Question 1 are: how library strategy and
administrative support can be used to start discussions and planning around the creation
of an information literacy course/program, building genuine faculty-librarian partnerships
356

as best practices, program design and organization, the problem with the one-shot course
and the part played by assessment in determining whether student are in fact, information
literate. Documents provided by study participants such as research articles, course
outlines and PowerPoint presentations were used to back up these discussions.
Exemplary institutions have used library strategy and administrative and faculty
support to aid them in building their information literacy programs. Each library has
created strategic documents with goals and objectives that are aligned with those of the
institution in terms of goals and objectives. This strategy allowed for the institution and
administration to be willing to work with librarians at the institution to create course
outcomes and to make decisions about how the program and courses will be integrated
into their unique general education programs and also into the majors. In every case,
librarians were placed on the institution’s general education committee to help develop
the approaches and perspectives, participate in curriculum mapping, classroom
explorations, decide what would be the foundation courses that a student would need to
take, determining the number of hours students would enroll in and how information
literacy competencies would be built into these. A unique general education curriculum
was designed by faculty, administrators and librarians on the general education
committee. A rubric was used to review all course proposals from faculty interested in
having information literacy integrated into their subject-specific courses. These courses
had to demonstrate student learning outcomes that were aligned to the standards chosen
as a course design model. The course learning goals were assessed cyclically with the
help of the institution’s administration through the assessment office. Feedback was then
used for making improvements to the information literacy.

357

Exemplary information literacy programs and courses could not be successful
without the establishment of strategic relationships between institutional faculty and
librarians. Documents provided by participants after interviews emphasized the
importance of moving faculty away from the idea of on-demand or one-shot instruction.
These are short instruction sessions where the librarians are called in either to teach a
class session to provide information literacy instruction merely because professors have
perceived a deficiency or shortcoming in their students and as a result, they approached
librarians with to determine how a librarian could remedy these shortcomings in their
students. It is suggested that librarians must engage their faculty to understand that
providing information literacy instruction is not merely about providing a “service” to
students. What is more important is for faculty to develop a collaborative relationship of
with librarians that is guided by actual principles like the Framework (2016) around an
agreed upon rich learning experience that would lead to success in teaching students
information literacy skills that would improve their subject-specific scholarship and
research.
Other documents provided by interview participants characterized the one-shot
information literacy session as an unsustainable librarian burnout model that limited
instruction librarians from being able to achieve their instructional potential, where the
question about information literacy is not about how relevant it really is, but rather about
who should be responsible for teaching the students in class. Librarians teaching courses
was important, not at the level of burnout, teaching one-shots that did not go far, but
information literacy for-credit courses were found to bolstered faculty work in the
disciplines. All eight institutions in the study are exemplary because they were able to

358

collaborate with faculty and administration at their institutions that then “funded” their
efforts to cooperate with faculty to teach information literacy. Information literacy
instruction in the smallest institutions in the study went way beyond the one-shot
instruction session, toward sequential courses that in some cases were flagged, or vetted,
allowing for information literacy to be integrated into them. The smallest institutions
taught courses where information literacy was taught to students 1-1. Larger institutions
had so many sections of information literacy courses that very few information literacy
sessions could be taught because there were insufficient numbers of librarians. There was
too little time available and too many undergraduate sections to teach. In these situations,
the one-shot session still reigned supreme, but librarians were aware that they were not
challenging students enough or reaching their goals with these sessions, since most one
shots did not have set outcomes. Instead they were aware that they needed to be able to
shift away from the one-shot information literacy session because they had done
exceptionally at teaching within the limited context of information literacy, where
through the one-shot, they had not influenced student learning as broadly as was needed.
It was, therefore, important to move away from being a guest lecturer” after they had
worked with faculty to create the acceptance of information literacy instruction and they
had to be the ones to lead the change in course delivery formats. In a case study about
one of the institutions included in the study, a program was developed where there was
administrators, faculty and librarians interacted as educational partners. In so doing, the
institution’s general education program adopted university undergraduate learning
outcomes that included critical thinking and inquiry skills as core learning outcomes
(Bluemle & Horowitz, 2014). These were scaffolded throughout the general education

359

curriculum. Librarians worked with faculty to create authentic research assignments for
students and developed faculty institutes that focused on collaborating to develop courses
with information literacy integration for the student experience from freshman year
through the senior year. Collaboration with the faculty led to further librarian
collaboration with the teaching and research centers on the campus.
Exemplary information literacy programs at all eight institutions were designed as
face-to-face courses and ranged from one-shots, courses taught at a distance, to librarians
embedded in online courses. Initially, the researcher had incorrectly assumed that
because institutions were large, they would be in the process of designing and teaching
information literacy courses online. Study findings indicated that blended/hybrid
information literacy courses that had online-components were being taught at institutions
in the study. This meant that students in face-to-face information literacy classes were
provided with access to online library tutorials, libguides, online database resources and
online webpages whenever necessary. They also often submitted assignments via a
learning management system, or played information literacy games specifically designed
to teach information literacy skills through online play. There were courses being taught
where information literacy had been integrated into a subject-specific online course, and
in that case, librarians were embedded in the course to aid students in answering research
questions and guiding them in completing their subject-specific assignments and projects.
Completely online information courses did not yet exist in any of the eight universities
studied, although one university had been involved in a summer program where online
courses were offered, and another was designing an online information literacy program
because their student body was growing and they did not have enough librarians to teach

360

their face-to-face information literacy sections. This institution determined that a
completely online course would work better.
Assessment, a best practice in information literacy is central to the development
of an information literacy course or a program. Exemplary institutions decided what
assessment methods and cycles would be implemented at the time that the course
outcomes and the courses themselves were being created. Based on the study, the most
common means of assessment used in the largest institutions were the AAC&U rubrics,
but standardized and homegrown information literacy tests such as the I-Skills Test and
TATIL were also given to students, but the latter was much more common at the smaller
institutions because both types of tests took time for students to complete. Documents
analyzed from one of the smaller institutions in the study, describe how they used
performance-based assessments in the form of in-class worksheets and questions targeted
to the specific learning outcomes of their course to assess student progress. The college’s
(one of those included in this study) assessment project found that students most easily
learned skills such as navigating the library of congress classification system, using
Boolean operators to limit their searches, locating topic-specific articles in the online
databases and learning how to use new databases. This suggested that the simplest tool
literacy skills were the easiest for their undergraduate students to master. However, when
it came to more complex tool literacy skills like formulating effective online searches,
identifying, selecting and identifying sources, reading and summarizing materials and
working what they had learned from sources into a paper to meet the requirements set by
the faculty, then they struggled the most. They did find too that their students were most
challenged by using the research articles that they had found to shape their research

361

questions and topics, selecting the best sources for their papers and evaluating their
information sources. Their findings were supported by Project Information Literacy
(2014) findings which stated that sophomore and senior students had most difficulty
getting started with their projects and with defining and narrowing search topics and
filtering their topic results. These findings allowed librarians at this institution to modify
their information literacy courses so that they were focused on the Association of College
and Research Standards, which emphasized the research process and focused on
developing students’ evaluated and analysis skills. The three sequential courses across
four years of study were thus developed to focus on developing student writing and
revision skills, reading skills, oral communication skills by exploring ideas through class
discussion and information literacy skill by exploring research in order to generate ideas
and questions for when students had to write a research paper.
In a case study document provided after interviews and analyzed by the
researcher, library instruction is assigned by the library coordinator of one of the smaller
colleges in the study as faculty/librarian partnerships. In 2011, a new assessment, an LFY
skills matrix that listed course outcomes and focused on measuring higher-level skills
was developed. In the first course of a sequence of three, higher-level skills such as
information organization, information formats, locating reliable information on a topic,
distinguishing between scholarly and popular sources and citing sources correctly using
MLA style were assessed. In the second course, higher-level skills like determining
whether information was appropriate for a research topic, formulating search strategies
and mapping concepts and considering authority, bias and source currency were assessed
along with other matrixed items. While in the third course the focus was on refining

362

research questions and employing advanced search strategies in the process. Five
instruction librarians at the university participated in the Assessment Project, ranking and
prioritizing course outcomes, the results providing new information that turned and drove
the needed changes that were required for the librarians to teach within a integrated
course design model (See Appendix M) with an instruction program that provides
students with help where they needed it the most and integrates the student's situational
factors into the course's learning goals, activities, and assessments.

Determining whether a student is information literate at graduation should flow
naturally from the information literacy course, its development, how it is taught and how
it is assessed. Unfortunately, this does not appear to be the case in this study. All eight of
the institutions are using assessments, some at a very complex level, others more simply,
but the assessments that librarians discuss are either done to assess the outcomes of the
information literacy course of the overall outcomes of the information literacy program as
it is setup within a general education program. The outcomes that are assessed are merely
to determine whether or not the librarians in collaboration with their faculty have met
course and program outcomes. Testing for the information literate student as a senior,
does not exist in any of the institutions at present. In applying both the Association of
College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the Framework (2016) in the
courses, either separately or combined with other information literacy models and
standards, implies that the aim of all the librarians at the eight institutions studied are to
be open to change. For years, the Standards (2000) have always been used as overall
course outcomes but being open to the Framework (2016) meant that they were willing to
experiment, overcome uncertainty and make changes and improvements in how they

363

were teaching their students, if it meant that their students could thrive. The outcomes
described at the beginning of the ACRL Standards (2000) that defines an information
literate individual as one who is able to:








Determine the extent of information needed,
Access the needed information effectively and efficiently,
Evaluate information and its sources critically,
Incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base,
Use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose,
Understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information,
and
Access and use information ethically and legally.
The Framework (2016) does not define what an information literate individual is but

suggests that information literacy is an extended “arc of learning throughout” (Para 8) the
students’ entire academic career. The Framework (2016) defines information literacy as a
“set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the
understanding of how information is produced and valued, and the use of information in
creating new knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning” (ACRL,
2016, Para. 9). This implies that it is possible for the student to be information literate
only if they are exposed to the complex concepts, theory and frames that have to be
taught with flexibility. But since there is no definition for an information literate
individual anymore, does that mean that we should forgo any testing of seniors to
determine whether they are information literate? I believe the flexible information
literacy skills learned will continue on past graduation. Will the skills only come to
fulfillment if the graduate student can exercise their skills as a lifelong learner?
Librarians in the study stated that when it came to assessing seniors and showing
that they are information literate, many were still at the course assessment level and some

364

have not reached the programmatic assessment level yet because their programs were
new or they would only does this type of assessment in their next assessment cycle. Only
then were they considering finding an answer to the question asked in this study about
whether or not their students were information literate at graduation. Some have
participated in small studies with limited results that were not able to tell them whether or
not their students were information literate. Others are uncertain about how to answer the
question and have no idea whether they will have an assessment in place in the near
future that would determine if their graduating seniors are information literate. This is a
very disturbing finding but it may be that in the future this question, as it is now, because
of the Framework might never be answered for any of the librarians in the study who are
now harnessing the Framework (2016) to their courses and programs.
It is important to note that the role that the university administrator plays in
developing the information literacy courses/programs on any institutional campus is key
to the entire course development process. Administrators should work with library
administrators and librarians to determine what is needed in terms of financial and
administrative support and staffing when the library is in the process of developing a new
information literacy course/program, revising one or only starting to think about
establishing and implementing one on the campus. It is the role of the university
administrator to interact by smoothing the process for librarians, especially in cases
where they might have difficulty being appointed to the necessary committees where they
can move the information literacy agenda forward, particularly in situations where they
may be regarded as staff rather than faculty.

365

It is important for the administrator to educate themselves about information
literacy and why it is important for the college student. Gathering information about
information literacy programs that have been successful at peer institutions similar to that
where the administrator is at work would help them to see how course/program
implementation can occur if it does not exist, or revision if it is sorely needed. They
should educate themselves about how best to aid their librarians to develop information
literacy faculty training programs when they are designing their courses, and should be
willing to aid the library financially when professional development opportunities arise
that could bolster their knowledge librarian knowledge and program improvement. That
way, librarians can prepare faculty for their roles in an information literacy program if it
is new and the librarians that will be teaching information literacy courses, can be further
train peers and faculty to better grasp the administrative processes required for the
development and evaluation of a very successful information literacy courses/programs.

Summary of Study Findings for Question 2: How do exemplary four-year college
library information literacy courses implement the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education
(2016)?

Analyzing Question 2, the major themes analyzed were the “The Association of
College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016)” and “The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards
(2000).”
The major findings were as follows:
366



Two exemplary libraries studied had Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) hardcoded into their undergraduate learning outcomes.



Librarians had pre-empted the Framework by teaching concepts in their
information literacy courses for several years prior to the release of the
Association of College and Research Libraries now identified as Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) concepts.



Librarians at six exemplary institutions were open and willing to experiment with
the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) and its
frames and were using both the Standards and the Framework (2016) and other
Standards from different disciplines together to meet their unique learning
outcomes.



Librarians were using the best of the Standards, Framework and discipline
standards in application to their information literacy courses.



The theoretical stance of the Framework (2016) represented “high level concepts”
which were as yet “un-measurable” to instructors, critical of the Association of
College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016) suggesting that they were unable to teach all the frames to the
students in their classes, since they did not see the necessity for teaching anything
that did not fulfill their unique outcomes.



Negative views abounded at some institutions associated with implementing the
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016), but there were
instructors interested in implementation and application. Critics realized the
importance of the new Framework (2016), not only because they had pre-empted

367

the Framework and were already applying the concepts the Framework (2016),
but because they already had created their own unique undergraduate learning
outcomes very similar to the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016) concepts.


Instructors were willing to test their own undergraduate learning outcomes unique
to their institution by having their students take the TATIL Assessment created in
2015 as a means of assessing each of the frames of the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016).



Instructors used the AAC&U Value Rubrics alongside the Framework and
Standards in their classes, and how they were also making use of other standards
that were working well for them in their subject specific information literacy
classes.



Instructors used additional standards other than those from ACRL in their
information literacy classes specifically with students in their majors, instructors
explained the importance of implementing these in their classes because they
were important to the faculty they were working with and whose subject areas
they were creating their information literacy courses to support.



Instructors that had not changed the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) into concrete undergraduate learning outcomes had a
love-hate relationship with the “ACRL Standards 2000,” claiming that they were
too rigid in application in some cases, but in others they actually did provide
instructors with a firm foundation on which to build their classes and make them

368

ready for application for the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016).

Discussion: Research Question 2
It was definitely time, after sixteen years, for the revision of the Association of
College and Research Libraries Standards. However, no-one expected that the standards
that had become central to information literacy curricula developed across the country
would be rescinded. It was interesting to discover that there were librarians who had
written their course outcomes by using the ACRL Standards (2000). Although these
librarians clearly understood that the field was on the cusp of a change, they were not
willing to go through the process of having their courses redesigned. And yet, barely a
year after the January 2016 interviews, all the institutions were reacting to the rescinding
of the Standards (2000) by accepting the Framework (2016), and even the newer concepts
such as the metaliteracies and seeing how best these could be incorporated into the
classroom.
Eighty percent of librarians interviewed during the study were already applying
concepts from the Framework (2016) in their classrooms. They understood that the
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) were not set in stone and
that they could use the standards as guidelines and adapt other models and standards to fit
how they were teaching their students. Librarians clearly understood that teaching
students “Tool Literacy” was very basic. They wanted their students to succeed in college
and also be successful in the workplace, and already understood that to do both, they had
to prepare the undergraduate student to write successful college papers and develop the
skills needed to be successful in the workplace. This meant preparing the student to

369

become a scholar who could complete personal research projects and enter graduate
school, at that point, understanding how to function as a researcher. Thus, librarians
moved beyond the tool literacy of the ACRL Standards, to prepare students to write and
revise their papers, read research papers and understand the statistical language of
authors, understand information ethics and how it affected their lives at work and school,
understand what they were reading, evaluate sources and cite them correctly. In the
process, librarians developed the high-level information literacy skills that would change
students into lifelong learners.
Librarians in the study were also interested in experimenting with new ideas in
the classroom. They were willing to embrace the frames and the Framework theories.
They were active participants at Association of College and Research Libraries
workshops about implementing the Framework in the classroom, and in blogs,
Association of College and Research Libraries online forums, discussion lists and boards
about the Framework on the Internet.
Due to the rescinding of the ACRL Standards (2000), libraries that had been
committed to the latter, were now creating libguides for their information literacy
program, explaining when during a student’s program they would teach the frames from
the ACRL Framework (2016) and which frames would be taught. For example,
matriculating freshmen took a customized writing course and 100 and 200 level
information literacy courses, and three frames would be integrated in those experiences.
Based on the 2016-19 course guide, an information literacy course was being created that
would be offered to students in two formats including face-to face, and online (University
of Rhode Island, Instruction Services & Information Literacy, Information Literacy

370

Program 2016-19). The idea of teaching only a handful of frames per year, that met
specific course outcomes, was interesting. This addressed concerns from librarians that
there was no way they could actually teach all the frames in their information literacy
classes. However it would appear that since librarians were now willing to accept the new
Framework as a replacement for the ACRL Standards (2000), this problem was now
solved.
With the rescinding of the ACRL Standards (2000) and an over-emphasis on the
ACRL Framework (2016) on ACRL listservs, websites and with countless researchers
writing about the new Framework (2016), more literature is being made available to
librarians that would allow them to get over their initial concerns voiced during
interviews. The literature will aid them to better understand the theoretical stance the
Framework (2016) had taken that to them represented “high level concepts” that were as
yet “un-measurable” and that they thought should be introduced to students in their
majors and not at the freshman level. With the introduction of the TATIL Assessment
created by Project SAILS, measuring the threshold concepts from the Framework (2016)
has become a reality. Thus measuring information literacy in relation to the Framework
(2016) once the TATIL Assessment is standardized will no longer be improbable.

371

Summary of Study Findings for Question 3: How do exemplary four-year colleges
and universities implement digital literacy and the six frames of the Association of
College and Research Libraries Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016)?

The Question 3 five major themes were: “the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework,” “the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000),” “Undergraduate Learning Outcomes,” “Teaching Methods and
Approaches” and “Teaching Digital Literacy.” Findings connected to these themes were
as follows:


Course design at each of the eight exemplary colleges and universities was
directly related to how information literacy was integrated into the general
education program at that specific college or university and to the outcomes that
were created by instruction librarians in collaboration with the faculty.



At all eight institutions information literacy was integrated both at the First Year
Seminar or experience level, where freshmen participated in a variety of different
types of instruction and then also at the level of the major.



In six of the eight colleges, the best features of the Association of College and
Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the Framework for Information Literacy
for Higher Education (2016) were being adapted so that these would meet the
unique outcomes of each of these institutions. At two institutions where the
general education program committees or boards had been persuaded to adopt the
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) as undergraduate

372

learning outcomes and there was an unwillingness on the part of these librarians
to move away from the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards
(2000) and adopt the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education
(2016), since it had taken years of hard work to attain the integration of the latter.


Libraries creating information literacy programs had not been relying on the
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) or the
Association of College and Research Libraries Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016) for the creation of their learning outcomes
and for deciding what they would teach. Instead, they have used three AAC&U
Rubrics and its language as standards and had tweaked those to meet their
institution’s unique outcomes.



Information literacy instructors were combining specific parts of the Association
of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) moving toward a combination
or hybridization of the two guidelines.



“Personalization” was practiced where institutions promoted a high level of
academic freedom and instructors and faculty collaboratively chose and applied
educational approaches that best suited their presentations within the major.



Instruction librarians at six of the exemplary universities had an interest in the
Framework, but never all six frames at any of the universities, with the two most
popular frames taught being “Scholarship as Conversation” and “Authority is
Contextual.”

373



Librarians did not feel that they needed to be compelled to teach all of the six
frames in their classes, like with the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000), they considered the Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (2016) to be a guideline for instruction which
would inform their own information literacy practice.



The Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) were still
very heavily applied across all eight exemplary institutions, whether or not they
had chosen to mix the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards
(2000) with rubrics and the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (2016) or additional Standards from other disciplines.



Instructors collaborated with their institutional faculty to present information
literacy instruction classes to their students in thirteen different formats. Eighty
percent of the 13 formats identified were online formats, and 20% were face-toface formats.



The most common online formats information literacy instructors were using to
teach and transfer information literacy content were: videos on different
information literacy topics, iPad instruction, online tutorials, blended courses,
course module development, embedded librarians, LibGuides, utilizing media and
social media platforms, online discussion groups, and chat reference.



In face-to-face classes, librarians used discussion groups in their teaching and in
two institutions, librarians developed presentations in different formats that
cultivated the student scholar by developing the freshman identity as not only to
be an active member of the university community, but as a student scholarship.

374



Teaching approaches were specifically related to how technology was being
taught at the eight exemplary institutions studied. Those whose instruction was
tool literacy focused, also tended to have less interest in teaching technology.



Blended learning was a common occurrence across all eight exemplary
institutions in this study. The most common use of blended instruction was the
online tutorial.



Only three of the largest universities out of the eight in the study, offered online
information literacy courses.



The majority of information literacy instruction courses at the large institutions in the
study were conducted as face-to-face one-shots with blended learning components.



The most common blended learning components used by instructors across the eight
institutions in their blended information literacy classes included the following: learning
management system modules, open education resources, servers, library webpages,
broadcast classes at specific sites for distance students, online tutorials and videos often
loaded on a Youtube Channel or elsewhere, embedded librarians, discussion boards,
Libguides and guide on the side.



Four out of the eight institutions offered online information literacy courses to
their students. The two smallest universities in the study did not offer online
information literacy courses but their course offerings to students were blended
since they included a large amount of online-components such as online videos,
interactive tutorials and online information literacy games.



Word Clouds were also created using Nvivo 11 Plus to better understand how the
eight colleges were similar or different when using recurring words that were
pulled from interview transcripts.

375

Discussion: Research Question 3
When the study was conducted in 2015, the findings indicated that in six of the
eight colleges, the best features of the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000) and the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education
(2016) were being adapted so that these would meet the unique outcomes of each of these
institutions. But there was also a general discontent with ACRL’s actions to rescind the
Standards and replace them with the Framework, but this event took place after this study
had already been conducted. It was clear though, from what librarians had said in their
interviews, that not everyone was sure about what to make of applying the new ACRL
Framework (2016) to the classroom. Although “pre-empted” where some areas of the
ACRL Framework (2016) that were considered universal in a librarian-sense because
they had started with the guidelines of the ACRL Standards (2000) but then as library
instruction progressed over sixteen years, there were new ideas and concepts that would
be born out of the Standards, and that were being taught in institutions who were moving
forward with the information literacy agenda. Thus it is not surprising that documentation
and articles provided by librarians after interviews stated that librarians would feel that
the ACRL Framework (2016) and the ACRL Standards (2000) should be allowed to cohabit in information literacy instruction. Librarians made it quite clear that they used both
sets of guidelines because they taught their courses with a great deal of “personalization”
and academic freedom was important, but on the other hand, they also preferred the status
quo, stating that all wanting to facilitate a transformation of their college communities
when it came to teaching information and digital literacy skill sets could easily do so
through information literacy practices that were set-out by the ACRL Standards (2000).
Many other librarians who had participated in this study, were adamant that the new
376

Framework (2016) had much to be desired when compared with the ACRL Standards
(2000). They believed that “the Standards” lent themselves to student engagement,
faculty and administrator collaboration and partnership, especially with those that wanted
“to mainstream information literacy practice...outside of the realm of library and
information science and the Academy” and that “the same” could not “ be said for the
new Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education” (Jackman & Weiner,
2016, p.3). This was because “the current Framework’s jargon” was too complex to
“resonate with the American public and policy makers who wrestle today with the range
of socio/economic/political challenges that could benefit from the inclusion of
information literacy goals” and thus were very concerned that the information literacy
agenda would be ignored by a “multitude of cross-sector organizations and agencies that
need to understand how information literacy can benefit them and their constituencies”
and that it would not be “conducive to promoting information literacy practice among
diverse, lay populations including students, faculty, and higher education administrators”
(Jackman & Weiner, p.4) that would be exposed to the library jargon used in the new
Framework.
When the Framework (2016) replaced the rescinded ACRL Standards, they
disagreed with ACRL’s move asking the question that all librarians were asking at the
time, “should both documents be promoted? Yes...definitely! Clearly, more work needs
to be done in terms of translating today’s educational theories into information literacy
practice and the new Framework represents one attempt. But to substitute one for the
other erodes and disrespects the substantial work that has been based on the Standards

377

(2000). Its severely diminishes the future reach of information literacy practice within
various occupations, professions, and communities” (Jackman & Weiner, 2016, p.3).
Instructors were candid about not only the hybridization of the ACRL Standards
(2000) and the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) but also
about including other rubrics in the mix. They believed that “personalization” was
important since their institutions promoted a high level of academic freedom and
instructors and faculty collaboratively chose and applied educational approaches that best
suited their presentations within the major. The AAC&U rubrics were used in
combination with the guidelines of the ACRL Standards (2000) and the Framework
(2016) that at the time of the study had not yet been vetted. An article provided to the
researcher about a study conducted at one of the institutions in this study described how
librarians collected from English, Psychology and History classes using AAC&U Value
Rubrics. Two rating procedures were used that included inter-rater reliability testing and
a norming process, with multiple raters the student papers. The GPA student index was
also included in the study, as it was conducted to determine whether student GPA, or how
well students were doing in college, was related to whether or not they had completed the
100 and 200-level English information literacy integrated classes. Findings suggested that
there was a correlation between GPA and students having taking the information literacy
courses. Findings suggested further that students that had taken the information literacy
integrated classes, where they were taught how to write and conduct research, had
substantially improved their writing skills and research skills as subject-specific writers
and researchers once they reached their junior and senior years. Five categories were
scored using the rubric which included: defines the extent of information needed, access

378

information needed, evaluate information and its sources critically and methodically, use
information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose and access and use information
ethically and legally (the five stipulations in the ACRL Standards (2000) that describe
information literate individuals). Analysis of each category aided librarians to determine
where their students were struggling and helped them to make important changes in the
library instruction that was being provided to their students at the time. Their study led to
the creation of an Information Literacy Fellows Summer Workshop, where faculty
worked with librarians to change and improve skills that students struggled with and as a
result, new lesson plans, learning outcomes and evaluation procedures were developed in
classes where information literacy was integrated across the institution. An additional
study shared with the researcher, written by librarians at the institution studied, explores
the relationship between course grades and sequenced library instruction focused more
specifically on information literacy interventions throughout Psychology students’
curriculum. This qualitative action research study that included focus groups and surveys
with students at the institution where study findings confirmed that students benefitted
from these useful collaborations with the library at sequenced points in their curriculum
and within the disciplines and brought important and significant changes to librarians
classes also the program as a whole.
Most librarians that participated in this study believed that they were teaching
digital literacy in their classrooms, although there were one or two who suggested that
they did not have time to teach digital literacy because they had set outcomes that needed
to be followed that did not include it. Often its definition was misconstrued as being able
to teach student technology skills that they already possessed or technology skills that

379

were associated with teaching their students how to program a computer, a skill set that
they did not possess as librarians.
The majority of the librarians in the study and this researcher consider digital
literacy to be synonymous with information literacy. This is because instructors were
using technology in their classrooms and teaching students to utilize library technology in
order to improve their information literacy skills. This understanding is correct because
digital literacy is defined as including “the ability to find and use information (otherwise
known as information literacy)” but also as going “beyond this to encompass
communication, collaboration and teamwork, social awareness in the digital environment,
understanding of e-safety and creation of new information. Both digital and information
literacy are underpinned by critical thinking and evaluation” (The Open University,
2016).
In an Annual Report for FY 2014-2015 link shared as documentation during the
study, additional information was provided about an institution participating in this study,
a number of the major accomplishments were listed, that included implementing
programs that included teaching their students digital literacy. These included: creating
and implementing lesson using IPad’s with their freshman English “courses that actively
engaged students and support the composition curriculum,” assessing libguides
integration with Canvas so that students could access these in Canvas, implementing a
DIY website to organize the library’s help guides better to improve student use of them,
conducting library website design and usability testing to improve the library websites
used by students and working on digital initiatives to build capacity for assisting faculty

380

with locating and incorporating open education resources in their courses (XXXXXX
Librarians Reference & Instruction Department Annual Report for FY 2014-2015, p.1).

Limitations of the Study

The limitations of this study are described below.
1. This is a very small and well-defined population. The target population consists
of librarians, faculty, and administrators associated with colleges and universities with
exemplary information literacy programs identified by an American College and
Research Libraries, Instruction Section Committee in the United States
2. Faculty participants could answer interview questions according to the
perceived expectations of the researcher or peers, instead of responding with an accurate
description of their own information literacy and instructional activities.
3. The participants may have preconceived ideas of the “right” or “socially
desirable” answers that the researcher may be looking for, rather than providing honest
answers.
4. Participants may have biased or inaccurate understandings of course
development issues and specific library, college, or accreditation concerns associated
with the development of their college or university’s information literacy course(s).

The questions posed in this study were most definitely affected by timing. When
interviews were conducted, there was a lot of uncertainty amongst librarians regarding
what would actually happen with the ACRL Standards (2000). It was unexpected that
even though the standards were considered to be outdated, that they would be cancelled
381

and repealed. They were immediately replaced with the ACRL Framework (2016). As a
result, librarians at two institutions in the study expressed their unwillingness to make a
change to a new Framework (2016) because they had committed to using the ACRL
Standards (2000) and were bothered by having to go over old and new ground once again
with their general education committee faculty to get a new Framework (2016) approved.
Others felt challenged by the fact that the creators of the Framework (2016) had usurped
many of their own ideas that they were already applying in the classroom and were
attributing these to this new standard. While librarians were not overly impressed, they
were often unsure of their next steps. Eight months after the study was conducted, the
library environments at most of the institutions have changed. This is easily viewed by
visiting the LibGuides of institutions in this study. Here is one such Libguide:
In the 21st Century, the ability to effectively and efficiently search for and
evaluate information is increasingly critical. As a result, it is a necessity for all
XXX students, staff, and faculty to be accomplished information users.
Recognizing this, the University Libraries’ Public Services librarians provide an
incremental long range plan that provides information literacy instruction based
on the Association of College & Research Libraries’ Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000) and on the ACRL
Framework for Information Literacy (2015). Drawing on the content and
goals of the ACRL Information Literacy Competencies and Framework, XXX is
committed to graduating students who are information literate citizens and
lifelong learners. “Information literacy is common to all disciplines, to all
learning environments, and to all levels of education. It enables learners to

382

master content and extend their investigations, become more self-directed and
assume greater control over their own learning. (American Library Association.
Presidential Committee on Information Literacy. Final Report. Chicago:
American Library Association, 198, Instruction Services & Information Literacy,
XXX Libguides, 2016).

There appears to be a lot more positive sentiment toward the Framework (2016)
and applying its flexibility to the classroom in the current, shifting digital library
environment now that it has been vetted by the Association of College and Research
Libraries. Though, at the same time, in some cases as listed in the comment above,
librarians have chosen not to lose ground, but place the Association of College and
Research Libraries Framework (2016) alongside the older Standards (2000), in order to
provide their students with solid information literacy courses/programs. Clearly, there is a
new commitment to using the Framework (2016), its theory and its frames and applying
it to library instruction, whether it is offered as a one-shot or an online session offered at
a distance. The dedication that was seen with applying the ACRL Standards (2000) is not
there yet, but librarians are willing to give the new guidelines a chance and have become
involved in lengthy email discussion on closed and library community listservs, online
workshops, blog discussion groups and listservs created specifically around the
Framework (2016). Project CORA created by one of the institutions in this study, is
doing an excellent job gathering instruction resources from librarians across the country
who are using the Framework (2016) and different library assessments in their courses.
CORA stands for Community of Online Research Assignments. It is an open
access resource for faculty and librarians. It is intended to be a collaborative
383

space for adapting and experimenting with research assignments and sharing the
success or lessons learned so that others may benefit. The database contains
multiple, reliable and reproducible research assignments that do not live as
isolated entities, but are enhanced by user feedback in order to build a rich
corpus of best practices (CORA: Community of Online Research Assignments,
2016).

Implications of the Study

Question 1
Based on Question 1 study findings, it is suggested that librarians preparing to
build information literacy programs should consider their library size and staffing and
their college structure and organization before deciding how best to develop their
information literacy program. Each of the eight libraries in the study developed
information literacy programs that meet their college goals and objectives, their college’s
specific needs, and that conforms to their university’s mission and vision. As a result,
information literacy courses and programs that are developed and designed for their
undergraduate students to fit within their specific general education programs and are
unique to their institutions. Administrative committees collaborate with the librarians to
understand what information literacy is, and how it can best be integrated into the
curriculum, as well as what format that integration would take. Library strategy is very
important, since this is what aligns the library’s mission, vision and goals with their
institution’s. Library strategic planning in relation to the information literacy course/
program which is to be developed offers library administration the opportunity to connect
384

with university administrators, faculty and librarians in necessary meetings regarding the
course/program and allows for effective collaboration with administrators and the faculty
to ascertain how best the information literacy integration will occur.
The study findings suggested that information literacy course/program
implementation was successful, not only because librarians read the library and education
research, but also because they were most apt in following these best practices that they
encountered in creating, developing, assessing or at a later point, redeveloping,
reorganizing and improving the information literacy course. Findings further suggested
that as new information literacy courses/programs were developed, librarians would do
well to research and follow best practices in education and library science, especially
when developing reference work and consultation processes for working with students
who were participants in their information literacy courses, and also for collaborating
with faculty, for developing curriculum and for applying teaching models when teaching,
administering and assessing their information literacy course(s).
The findings also implied that one-shot information literacy courses, although
commonly used at institutions with large student bodies, did not provide students with
enough information literacy instruction. The in the article Serving Notice on the OneShot: changing roles of instruction librarians (2016), provided to the researcher after
interviews were conducted, suggested the one-shot was a “siloed”(p.137) model that was
created to meet faculty demands by providing “a quick fix to immediate problems and
offers service for faculty and students” (p.139). It was further suggested that instruction
librarians should “just say no” to providing one-shot information literacy sessions at their

385

institutions “in order to focus on the bigger issues of course and curriculum design”
(p.142).
Study findings indicated that across eight institutions, librarians were using
different types of information literacy practices and models. Thus it was common for
librarians to suggest that they were using the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards, but they were also using the frames from the Framework and
subject-specific models e.g. Association of School Librarians Information Literacy
Standards. This means that even though vetted standards were being used by librarians in
their information literacy courses, they were interested in adapting them for their own use
in the classroom, in order to meet their own unique outcomes. Findings also suggest that
the use of rubrics in random assessments to determine whether librarian course outcomes
were met was not enough. Even though it was a good idea to sample a cross-section of
student work from different sections, the researcher had concerns about those students
who did poorly on the assessment that they would then be allowed to fall through the
cracks. There is also the understanding that no assessment is ever perfect and that results
from these may or may not answer the questions librarians are asking about the progress
of their students.
The study findings indicated that there was plenty of anecdotal evidence available
suggesting that students graduating from the eight institutions in the study were in fact,
graduating information literate. Information literacy assessments were most often being
conducted by librarians to determine whether or not they were meeting their course
outcomes, but not specifically to determine if their students were graduating information
literate. Librarians at the eight institutions in the study had no formal information literacy

386

assessments or tests in place for their students who were graduating. There was no
evidence that the students were information literate at graduation. Since the ultimate goal
of every information literacy course has always been to prepare students to become
information literate, librarians should be encouraged to develop assessment procedures
that are put in place at their universities to measure the information literacy of their
graduating seniors. But then the question must be asked, if a passing grade or a pass/fail
measurement on an assessment or test is enough to determine the level at which a student
is information literate. Information literacy is a lifelong experience; and maybe it is
enough to know that at graduation, students have been armed with the skills to begin their
journey toward becoming information literate, lifelong learner
Question 2
The study findings imply that despite the negative views that abounded at some
institutions associated with implementing the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (2016), there were also those instructors that were interested in
implementation and application. In the past year, prior to the rescinding of the
Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000), librarians were given
the opportunity to weigh-in on the Framework (2016) as it was being developed.
Librarians were able to share their opinions about the Framework (2016) and be very
candid about their concerns regarding the new Framework that was in development.
Librarians had the opportunity also to participate in online workshops with the
researchers who had developed the Framework and ask questions about how it was
different from the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) and
how it could be implemented and used in the classroom. For a while, librarians were

387

considering the possibility that the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000) and the new Framework would be available to be used side-by-side in
the classroom. This was in keeping with the finding that it was common for instructors to
combine specific parts of the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards
(2000) and the Framework (2016) and it would be possible to move toward a
combination or hybridization of the two guidelines when courses were created for the
classroom. However, the decision was finally made by Association of College and
Research Libraries to rescind the Association of College and Research Libraries
Standards (2000) because the latter had outlived its usefulness. Due to this paradigm
shift, information literacy was redefined.
ACRL recognizes the tremendous contributions of the Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education and the transformational work of
many ACRL members working with them. Those Standards paved the way for
information literacy to become common language in many general education
requirements and informed many regional and subject-oriented accreditation
bodies. The Board will continue to seek input from the profession as the process
moves forward (ACRL Board, June 25, 2016).
After the Standards (2000) were rescinded an information literacy listserv was created
where librarians could share questions and answers specific to the Framework (2016).
Since then, countless workshops about the Framework (2016) were held at the American
Library Association Conferences and researchers have written many articles on the topic
of applying the Framework (2016) and understanding the threshold concepts. The ACRL
Framework for Information Literacy Sandbox (Association of College and Research

388

Libraries, 2016) was created this past year to help librarians transition from using the
ACRL Standards, and become more comfortable using the Framework (2016). As
described in an email from Association of College and Research Libraries Board stating
that the sandbox was developed to “provide a space for librarians to share examples of
how they are using the Framework. This will include such things as lesson plans, rubrics,
assessments, and learning outcomes. These resources will be tangible tools that librarians
can adapt to their work. ACRL interview comments are developing discipline-specific
companion documents that address the need for learning outcomes and assessment. It is
the Board’s intention to ensure that tools are available to assist all librarians in the
practical application of the Framework” (McCartney, 2016). The new sandbox also
includes CORA, created by one of the institutions in this study, which is an online search
tool that provides access to resources contributed by faculty who have developed lesson
plans, learning objects, course modules and instruction-program materials to share with
the community (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2016).
Visiting course outlines and libguides created by the eight universities a year after
the completion of this study, it is not surprising to find that these librarians have made
many changes to their programs in order to incorporate and apply the new ACRL
Framework (2016) in their courses.
Question 3
When the study was conducted, the Association of College and Research
Libraries Standards (2000) were still very heavily applied across all eight exemplary
institutions, whether or not they had chosen to mix the Standards (2000) with rubrics and
the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016) or additional

389

standards from other disciplines. What is implied is that it would be very easy for the
librarians at these institutions, to accept the Framework (2016), even though at the time
everyone was uncertain about where everyone in the field and the ACRL were going.
This was because librarians pointed out during the study that the Framework (2016) that
had been developed was built on ideas and concepts that were already important in
information literacy. Every instruction librarian considered it necessary to teach their
students the information literacy fundamentals, such as being able to use the library
catalog, search the databases and use the library tools that were available to both
freshmen and students in the majors, in order to do research effectively. But they also
deemed it necessary to teach students about scholarship. Thus it was not surprising that
the two most popular frames taught, according to librarians in the study were “Authority
is Constructed and Contextual” and “Scholarship as Conversation,” since both frames are
flexible and at the level of simplicity. They include themes that connect with the
Standards (2000) since emphasizing the first frame, librarians would teach students about
source evaluation, as they did when teaching the Standards, and with the second frame,
they could focus on teaching their students about the research process as they have
always done. At the same time, the majority of librarians interviewed in the study were
viewing both the old Standards and the new Framework as mere guidelines for
developing their unique course outcomes and their instruction serving to inform their own
information literacy practice and not as a given as a firm or set rule by which they needed
to instruct their students. The implications of these findings suggest that even if the
Framework (2016) took center stage, librarians would work flexibly around the frames
and theories associated with it and include these whenever they were developing course

390

or program outcomes and course content, but they would always remain open to any
other theories or models from the fields and disciplines that they touch and deal with in
their teaching of information literacy. Librarians in general have always been comfortable
and willing to accept and adopt new ideas, just as they find it easy to adapt to and adopt
new technologies into their libraries.
Librarians were divided on the topic of digital literacy. Those who preferred to
use the standards as a guideline were often less technology flexible, believing that their
students entered college with a knowledge of the technology tools, and that they had no
need to teach them the basics. They did however believe that their students needed to
learn how to navigate their library. However, there was clearly an anti-technology stance
since some librarians believed that if you were going to teach digital literacy, then you
needed to teach students how to code. Often they were resistant because they did not have
the programming skills to do so. However, most programs examined in the study
provided students with high-levels of technological integrations, requiring their students
to use technology to learn information literacy skills. The most common technology used
by librarians for teaching students information literacy skills were college websites,
online tutorials, chat reference interactions, libguides, LMS’s (Course Modules) and
additional formats where teaching content could be transferred to them such as video,
social media platforms and games. It was therefore not surprising for the researcher who
agreed, to discover that there were librarians in the study that did not perceive a
difference between digital literacy and information literacy, even though they were aware
that each had a definition of its own in the literature. Instead, they considered digital
literacy to be the same as information literacy. This is also not surprising considering the

391

fact that the metaliteracies were being introduced as a part of the new theory surrounding
the Framework (2016), and that digital literacy was considered to be one of the
metaliteracies described in the model that librarians were encouraged to consider
teaching in the classroom. In describing the Framework (2016), the emergent
metaliteracies such as visual literacy, news literacy, digital literacy, media literacy and
transliteracy, and several others were associated with the metaliteracy model, were being
explored by librarians as they ventured up the steep curve of understanding the new
Framework (2016) (State University of New York, 2016).

Conclusion

After the first and only round of the Association of College and Research
Libraries Information Literacy Best Practices: Exemplary Information literacy program
was concluded, that recognized academic libraries as information literacy instruction
leaders, no further institutions were invited to apply for the honor to be recognized as
“exemplary.” As a result, the idea of the “exemplary,” information literacy programs
disappeared from the literature, but despite this faux pas, librarians representing the
information literacy programs at the this study’s eight institutions emerge as information
literacy instruction gurus, researchers and leaders that have much to contribute to the
library community and Academy. Their contributions continue in the education and
library science literature in the areas of creating, developing, assessing, revising and
sustaining viable information literacy instruction courses/programs that work well in

392

preparing the students that are taught at their institutions to be technology savvy lifelong
learners.
Research about what an “exemplary” information literacy course/program looks
like in theory needed to be conducted so that library instructors in the field who want to
forgo the one-shot information literacy session know where to start and exactly what it
would take, for them to begin a for-credit or a course integrated information literacy
course/program at their institution.
The researcher’s understanding of information literacy and her views and
perceptions pertaining to how each of the eight institutions continue to be considered
“exemplary” was shaped by her experiences as a researcher, student, teacher, librarian,
instruction designer and lifelong learner. The researcher is in complete agreement with
renowned information literacy researcher, William Badke when in his keynote address
Getting Information Literacy into the Academy – Problem and Prospect: Keynote
Address for the Annual Conference of the Association of Christian Librarians, on June
11, 2013, he stated the following about information literacy and the place of librarians in
academia as we forge ever forward into the 21st century: “I think we are on the verge of
an information literacy revolution. As the world of information becomes more and more
confusing, and as databases become more and more complex, I see a growing hunger
among academics and students for someone to lead them out of the fog. I believe our day
has come” (Badke, 2013, p. 12).

Recommendations for Future Study

The recommendations for future study are as follows:
393

In the Prologue the researcher suggests that it would be interesting to determine
what the learning experiences have been of students in the eight exemplary programs.
Thus it is suggested that a viable study could be developed around this topic in the future.

What is the learning experience of students at the eight exemplary colleges and
universities in this study?
What is the experience of students that have participated in the integrated
information literacy courses/programs at the eight universities that have been studied in
this dissertation? How are their experiences similar or different? What unique
experiences have students had coming from different universities that have unique
information literacy outcomes and what can information literacy instructors that are
developing programs at their own institutions learn from these experiences that could
help them to improve their information literacy instruction?
Determining whether graduating seniors are information literate
It is vitally important that institutions examine effective ways of assessing information
literate outcomes. Considering the time, energy and resources devoted to developing
strong programs, it would make sense to have a robust assessment system. Based on the
findings of this study, all eight institutions studied only have access to anecdotal evidence
that their students were information literate based on self-reports from their students.
Studies have been attempted in the past, but did not provide the information that
instructors needed to answer this question at their institution. Thus, it falls to researchers
at institutions in this study and in the field to consider formal assessments that can

394

provide data determining if graduates at these institutions actually enter the workplace,
information literate.
One year after the ACRL Standards (2000) have been rescinded, what has changed?
To gain a better understanding of how instructors are faring after the vetting of the
ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016), extension
topics emerge: How is digital literacy being taught? Are instructors including
metaliteracy in their teaching and how are they accomplishing that? What changes have
taken place a year after the Framework (2016) Standards were rescinded? How are
instructors using the Framework (2016) in their instruction and how has their
understanding of the threshold concepts this changed instruction? Are students
information literate as a result of the change? Are librarians still using the Association of
College and Research Libraries Standards (2000) despite it being rescinded? Are
librarians still using the best of the Association of College and Research Libraries
Framework (2016) information literacy guidelines together with subject-specific
standards? Has the Framework (2016) changed this? These questions highlight the
research that still needs to be undertaken.
Small academic institutions, funding and the ACRL Framework (2016)
It would be worthwhile to conduct a study that determines how small academic
institutions that have information literacy courses/programs are implementing the ACRL
Framework (2016) and whether these courses/programs are being threatened due to
financial constraints because of the current recession. Case studies would be of particular
interest, and comparisons between institutions, since few existed when the ACRL
395

Standards (2000) were implemented. How are smaller institutions implementing the
Frames? Are smaller institutions finding it harder to establish information literacy
courses/programs due to funding limitations? How? Are information literacy programs at
small academic institutions being threatened by the recession? What other limitations are
preventing librarians from establishing information literacy courses/programs at smaller
institutions? Finding answers to these questions will provide researchers with a good
understanding of how small academic institutions are faring when it comes to information
literacy.
Why has the information literacy online course not become an established
teaching format in US colleges and universities?
The researcher had originally assumed that it would be common for librarians to
teach information literacy courses online, specifically in larger institutions. In this study,
the researcher found that this was not the case. The research was still baffled about this
and could really not determine why more institutions were not teaching their information
literacy courses in completely online formats. Why are librarians hesitant about teaching
completely online courses? Why is there a preference for blended and face-to-face
information literacy courses over completely online courses? Assumptions can be laid to
rest if research is conducted to adequately answer these questions.
Understanding the information literacy minor
Reading the articles of prolific information literacy specialist, William Badke, the
researcher was convinced that teaching only one or two courses was not enough to have

396

students graduate from college information literate. As a result, it is necessary for
librarians in collaboration with faculty and administrators, to work to develop/create
information literacy minors and majors, where students could take 12-21 credit hours of
information literacy courses before graduation. The researcher discovered that there were
eight to ten colleges already offering information literacy minors, did not pursue this
course of study as a dissertation. This topic would be an excellent one.

Chapter Summary
In this chapter, the three research questions were restated and followed by a
description of the problems the researcher encountered during this study, the obstacles
related to the study and the benefits related to the study. Summaries of the study findings
for Questions, 1, 2 and 3 were provided along with discussions that were related to major
topics that were addressed in relation to each question. The study finding summaries were
followed by study implications. The conclusions and recommendations chapter ended
with a conclusion and the researcher’s recommendations for future research related to the
research topics discussed.

Pre-Research Email Letter
Hello___________________
I found your contact information on the ACRL Information Literacy Best Practices;
Exemplary Programs for 2014 website. I am emailing you because I am a doctoral
student at Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS. I am currently working on my
dissertation proposal and am interested in four-year colleges that have exemplary
programs and more specifically how the ACRL Standards and the Framework are being
implemented in information literacy courses and whether you might have implemented
any digital literacy courses at your university. I am also interested in online learning and
whether or not you have implemented elements online courses, online tutorials, learning
objects or other online resources with which you are teaching your information literacy
courses. I selected colleges/universities from the ACRL Best practices for 2014.
This would be a qualitative study, so I would be asking participants to participate in an
interview 45 minutes to an hour on the phone, and a 30 minute phone follow-up
interview.
Here are my dissertation questions that I am asking about exemplary programs:
The research questions relating to the development of information literacy courses
in exemplary colleges and universities in the United States are as follows:
1. How are exemplary 4-year colleges implementing exemplary information literacy courses?
2. How do exemplary 4-year college library information literacy courses implement the
Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education (2000), and the American College and Research
Libraries Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education (2015)?
3. To what extent is digital literacy incorporated into these exemplary information literacy courses?
My

dissertation

chair

suggested

that

I

make

contact

with

faculty/instruction

librarians/coordinators at colleges and universities that fit my study’s criteria and ask if you might
be interested in participating in my study so that I can have an idea of how many participants I
would have at each site to be studied.

437

If you are interested, then might you be able to suggest who I include as participants in my study?

Thanks so much for reading this email and considering my request. I look forward to hearing
back from you soon.

Hello XXX

Thank you for being willing to participate in my upcoming dissertation
study :
Exemplary Online Information Literacy Courses at Selected
4-year Colleges and Universities.
I will defend my dissertation proposal on November 16. I need your
help please with the following three items:
1.

I need to be sure that you do offer your information literacy
course/integrated information literacy in an online format
2. I have chosen to study a total of 7 exemplary college information
literacy programs that includes your college’s information literacy
program. I was told that 7 interviews are too few to complete my
study and that since this is a dissertation coming from the Education
438

Department, I would need to triangulate my data collected by asking if
it was possible to interview three staff members from each college:
Yourself, one instructor teaching in your program and one
administrator/library director if that is at all possible associated with
the library. Please advise.
3. Might you be available in the last week of November or sometime in
early December for an interview?
Thank you so much for your help and I do look forward to talking so
more with you about my request.

Introduction
This Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework) grows out
of a belief that information literacy as an educational reform movement will realize its
potential only through a richer, more complex set of core ideas. During the fifteen years
since the publication of the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education,1 academic librarians and their partners in higher education associations have
developed learning outcomes, tools, and resources that some institutions have deployed
to infuse information literacy concepts and skills into their curricula. However, the
rapidly changing higher education environment, along with the dynamic and often
uncertain information ecosystem in which all of us work and live, require new attention
to be focused on foundational ideas about that ecosystem. Students have a greater role
and responsibility in creating new knowledge, in understanding the contours and the
changing dynamics of the world of information, and in using information, data, and
scholarship ethically. Teaching faculty have a greater responsibility in designing
curricula and assignments that foster enhanced engagement with the core ideas about
451

information and scholarship within their disciplines. Librarians have a greater
responsibility in identifying core ideas within their own knowledge domain that can
extend learning for students, in creating a new cohesive curriculum for information
literacy, and in collaborating more extensively with faculty.
The Framework offered here is called a framework intentionally because it is based on a
cluster of interconnected core concepts, with flexible options for implementation, rather
than on a set of standards, learning outcomes, or any prescriptive enumeration of skills.
At the heart of this Framework are conceptual understandings that organize many other
concepts and ideas about information, research, and scholarship into a coherent whole.
These conceptual understandings are informed by the work of Wiggins and McTighe,2
which focuses on essential concepts and questions in developing curricula and focuses on
threshold concepts.3 Threshold concepts are those ideas in any discipline that are
passageways or portals to enlarged understanding or ways of thinking and practicing
within that discipline. This Framework draws upon an ongoing Delphi Study that has
identified several threshold concepts in information literacy,4 but the Framework has
been molded using fresh ideas and emphases for the threshold concepts. Two added
elements illustrate important learning goals related to those concepts: knowledge
practices,5 which are demonstrations of ways in which learners can increase their
understanding of these information literacy concepts and dispositions,6 which describe
ways in which to address the affective, attitudinal, or valuing dimension of learning. The
Framework is organized into six frames, each consisting of a concept central to
information literacy, a set of knowledge practices, and a set of dispositions. The six
concepts that anchor the frames are presented alphabetically:


Authority Is Constructed and Contextual



Information Creation as a Process



Information Has Value



Research as Inquiry



Scholarship as Conversation



Searching as Strategic Exploration

Neither the knowledge practices nor the dispositions that support each concept are
intended to prescribe what local institutions should do in using the Framework; each
library and its partners on campus will need to deploy these frames to best fit their own
situation, including designing learning outcomes. For the same reason, these lists should
not be considered exhaustive.
In addition, this Framework draws significantly upon the concept of metaliteracy,7 which
offers a renewed vision of information literacy as an overarching set of abilities in which
students are consumers and creators of information who can participate successfully in
collaborative spaces.8 Metaliteracy demands behavioral, affective, cognitive, and

452

metacognitive engagement with the information ecosystem. This Framework depends on
these core ideas of metaliteracy, with special focus on metacognition,9 or critical selfreflection, as crucial to becoming more self-directed in that rapidly changing ecosystem.
Because this Framework envisions information literacy as extending the arc of learning
throughout students’ academic careers and as converging with other academic and social
learning goals, an expanded definition of information literacy is offered here to
emphasize dynamism, flexibility, individual growth, and community learning:
Information literacy is the set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective
discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced and valued,
and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating ethically in
communities of learning.
The Framework opens the way for librarians, faculty, and other institutional partners to
redesign instruction sessions, assignments, courses, and even curricula; to connect
information literacy with student success initiatives; to collaborate on pedagogical
research and involve students themselves in that research; and to create wider
conversations about student learning, the scholarship of teaching and learning, and the

create new perspectives and ways of understanding a discipline or challenging knowledge
domain. Such concepts produce transformation within the learner; without them, the
learner does not acquire expertise in that field of knowledge. Threshold concepts can be
thought of as portals through which the learner must pass to develop new perspectives
and wider understanding. Jan H. F. Meyer, Ray Land, and Caroline Baillie. “Editors’

Frames
These six frames are presented alphabetically and do not suggest a particular sequence in
which they must be learned.

Authority Is Constructed and Contextual
Information resources reflect their creators’ expertise and credibility, and are evaluated
based on the information need and the context in which the information will be used.
Authority is constructed in that various communities may recognize different types of
authority. It is contextual in that the information need may help to determine the level of
authority required.
Experts understand that authority is a type of influence recognized or exerted within a
community. Experts view authority with an attitude of informed skepticism and an
openness to new perspectives, additional voices, and changes in schools of thought.
Experts understand the need to determine the validity of the information created by
different authorities and to acknowledge biases that privilege some sources of authority
over others, especially in terms of others’ worldviews, gender, sexual orientation, and
cultural orientations. An understanding of this concept enables novice learners to
critically examine all evidence—be it a short blog post or a peer-reviewed conference
proceeding—and to ask relevant questions about origins, context, and suitability for the
current information need. Thus, novice learners come to respect the expertise that
authority represents while remaining skeptical of the systems that have elevated that
authority and the information created by it. Experts know how to seek authoritative
voices but also recognize that unlikely voices can be authoritative, depending on need.
Novice learners may need to rely on basic indicators of authority, such as type of
publication or author credentials, where experts recognize schools of thought or
discipline-specific paradigms.
Knowledge Practices


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:

454



Define different types of authority, such as subject expertise (e.g., scholarship), societal
position (e.g., public office or title), or special experience (e.g., participating in a historic
event).



Use research tools and indicators of authority to determine the credibility of sources,
understanding the elements that might temper this credibility.



Understand that many disciplines have acknowledged authorities in the sense of wellknown scholars and publications that are widely considered “standard”. Even in those
situations, some scholars would challenge the authority of those sources.



Recognize that authoritative content may be packaged formally or informally and may
include sources of all media types.



Acknowledge they are developing their own authoritative voices in a particular area and
recognize the responsibilities this entails, including seeking accuracy and reliability,
respecting intellectual property, and participating in communities of practice.



Understand the increasingly social nature of the information ecosystem where authorities
actively connect with one another and sources develop over time.

Dispositions


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Develop and maintain an open mind when encountering varied and sometimes conflicting
perspectives



Motivate themselves to find authoritative sources, recognizing that authority may be
conferred or manifested in unexpected ways



Develop awareness of the importance of assessing content with a skeptical stance and
with a self-awareness of their own biases and worldview



Question traditional notions of granting authority and recognize the value of diverse ideas
and worldviews



Are conscious that maintaining these attitudes and actions requires frequent selfevaluation

Information Creation as a Process
Information in any format is produced to convey a message and is shared via a selected
delivery method. The iterative processes of researching, creating, revising, and
disseminating information vary, and the resulting product reflects these differences.

455

The information creation process could result in a range of information formats and
modes of delivery, so experts look beyond format when selecting resources to use. The
unique capabilities and constraints of each creation process as well as the specific
information need determine how the product is used. Experts recognize that information
creations are valued differently in different contexts, such as academia or the workplace.
Elements that affect or reflect on the creation, such as a pre- or post-publication editing or
reviewing process, may be indicators of quality. The dynamic nature of information
creation and dissemination requires ongoing attention to understand evolving creation
processes. Recognizing the nature of information creation, experts look to the underlying
processes of creation as well as the final product to critically evaluate the usefulness of
the information. Novice learners begin to recognize the significance of the creation
process, leading them to increasingly sophisticated choices when matching information
products with their information needs.
Knowledge Practices


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Articulate the capabilities and constraints of information developed through various
creation processes



Assess the fit between an information product’s creation process and a particular
information need



Articulate the traditional and emerging processes of information creation and
dissemination in a particular discipline



Recognize that information may be perceived differently based on the format in which it
is packaged



Recognize the implications of information formats that contain static or dynamic
information



Monitor the value that is placed upon different types of information products in varying
contexts



Transfer knowledge of capabilities and constraints to new types of information products



Develop, in their own creation processes, an understanding that their choices impact the
purposes for which the information product will be used and the message it conveys



Dispositions



Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Are inclined to seek out characteristics of information products that indicate the
underlying creation process



Value the process of matching an information need with an appropriate product
456



Accept that the creation of information may begin initially through communicating in a
range of formats or modes



Accept the ambiguity surrounding the potential value of information creation expressed
in emerging formats or modes



Resist the tendency to equate format with the underlying creation process



Understand that different methods of information dissemination with different purposes
are available for their use

Information Has Value
Information possesses several dimensions of value, including as a commodity, as a means
of education, as a means to influence, and as a means of negotiating and understanding
the world. Legal and socioeconomic interests influence information production and
dissemination.
The value of information is manifested in various contexts, including publishing
practices, information access, the commodification of personal information, and
intellectual property laws. The novice learner may struggle to understand the diverse
values of information in an environment where “free” information and related services
are plentiful and the concept of intellectual property is first encountered through rules of
citation or warnings about plagiarism and copyright law. As creators and users of
information, experts understand their rights and responsibilities when participating in a
community of scholarship. Experts understand that value may be wielded by powerful
interests in ways that marginalize certain voices. However, value may be leveraged by
individuals and organizations to effect change and may be leveraged for civic, economic,
social, or personal gains. Experts also understand the individual is responsible for making
deliberate and informed choices about when to comply with and when to contest current
legal and socioeconomic practices concerning the value of information.
Knowledge Practices


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Give credit to the original ideas of others through proper attribution and citation



Understand that intellectual property is a legal and social construct that varies by culture



Articulate the purpose and distinguishing characteristics of copyright, fair use, open
access, and the public domain



Understand how and why some individuals or groups of individuals may be
underrepresented or systematically marginalized within the systems that produce and
disseminate information



Recognize issues of access or lack of access to information sources

457



Decide where and how their information is published



Understand how the commodification of their personal information and online
interactions affects the information they receive and the information they produce or
disseminate online



Make informed choices regarding their online actions in full awareness of issues related
to privacy and the commodification of personal information

Dispositions


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Respect the original ideas of others



Value the skills, time, and effort needed to produce knowledge



See themselves as contributors to the information marketplace rather than only
consumers of it



Are inclined to examine their own information privilege

Research as Inquiry
Research is iterative and depends upon asking increasingly complex or new questions
whose answers in turn develop additional questions or lines of inquiry in any field.
Experts see inquiry as a process that focuses on problems or questions in a discipline or
between open or unresolved disciplines. Experts recognize the collaborative effort within
a discipline to extend the knowledge in that field. Many times, this process includes
points of disagreement where debate and dialogue work to deepen the conversations
around knowledge. This process of inquiry extends beyond the academic world to the
community at large, and the process of inquiry may focus upon personal, professional, or
societal needs. The spectrum of inquiry ranges from asking simple questions that depend
upon basic recapitulation of knowledge to increasingly sophisticated abilities to refine
research questions, use more advanced research methods, and explore more diverse
disciplinary perspectives. Novice learners acquire strategic perspectives on inquiry and a
greater repertoire of investigative methods.
Knowledge Practices


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Formulate questions for research based on information gaps or on reexamination of
existing, possibly conflicting, information



Determine an appropriate scope of investigation



Deal with complex research by breaking complex questions into simple ones, limiting the
scope of investigations

458



Use various research methods, based on need, circumstance, and type of inquiry



Monitor gathered information and assess for gaps or weaknesses



Organize information in meaningful ways



Synthesize ideas gathered from multiple sources



Draw reasonable conclusions based on the analysis and interpretation of information

Dispositions


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Consider research as open-ended exploration and engagement with information



Appreciate that a question may appear to be simple but still disruptive and important to
research



Value intellectual curiosity in developing questions and learning new investigative
methods



Maintain an open mind and a critical stance



Value persistence, adaptability, and flexibility and recognize that ambiguity can benefit
the research process



Seek multiple perspectives during information gathering and assessment



Seek appropriate help when needed



Follow ethical and legal guidelines in gathering and using information



Demonstrate intellectual humility (i.e., recognize their own intellectual or experiential
limitations)

Scholarship as Conversation
Communities of scholars, researchers, or professionals engage in sustained discourse with
new insights and discoveries occurring over time as a result of varied perspectives and
interpretations.
Research in scholarly and professional fields is a discursive practice in which ideas are
formulated, debated, and weighed against one another over an extended time. Instead of
seeking discrete answers to complex problems, experts understand that a given issue may
be characterized by several competing perspectives as part of an ongoing conversation in
which information users and creators come together and negotiate meaning. Experts
understand that, though some topics have established answers through this process, a
query may have more than one uncontested answer. Experts are, therefore, inclined to

459

seek out many perspectives, not merely the ones with which they are familiar. These
perspectives might be in their own discipline or profession or may be in other fields.
Even though novice learners and experts at all levels can take part in the conversation,
established power and authority structures may influence their ability to participate and
can privilege certain voices and information. Developing familiarity with the sources of
evidence, methods, and modes of discourse in the field assists novice learners to enter the
conversation. New forms of scholarly and research conversations provide more avenues
in which a wide variety of individuals may have a voice in the conversation. Providing
attribution to relevant previous research is also an obligation of participation in the
conversation. It enables the conversation to move forward and strengthens one’s voice in
the conversation.
Knowledge Practices


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Cite the contributing work of others in their own information production



Contribute to scholarly conversation at an appropriate level, such as local online
community, guided discussion, undergraduate research journal, conference
presentation/poster session



Identify barriers to entering scholarly conversation via various venues



Critically evaluate contributions made by others in participatory information
environments



Identify the contribution particular articles, books, and other scholarly pieces make to
disciplinary knowledge



Summarize the changes in scholarly perspective over time on a particular topic within a
specific discipline



Recognize that a given scholarly work may not represent the only or even the majority
perspective on the issue

Dispositions


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Recognize they are often entering into an ongoing scholarly conversation and not a
finished conversation



Seek out conversations taking place in their research area



See themselves as contributors to scholarship rather than only consumers of it



Recognize that scholarly conversations take place in various venues

460



Suspend judgment on the value of a particular piece of scholarship until the larger context
for the scholarly conversation is better understood



Understand the responsibility that comes with entering the conversation through
participatory channels



Value user-generated content and evaluate contributions made by others



Recognize that systems privilege authorities and that not having a fluency in the language
and process of a discipline disempowers their ability to participate and engage

Searching as Strategic Exploration
Searching for information is often nonlinear and iterative, requiring the evaluation of a
range of information sources and the mental flexibility to pursue alternate avenues as new
understanding develops.
The act of searching often begins with a question that directs the act of finding needed
information. Encompassing inquiry, discovery, and serendipity, searching identifies
possible relevant sources and the means to access those sources. Experts realize that
information searching is a contextualized, complex experience that affects, and is
affected by, the searcher’s cognitive, affective, and social dimensions. Novice learners
may search a limited set of resources, and experts may search more broadly and deeply to
determine the most appropriate information within the project scope. Likewise, novice
learners tend to use few search strategies; experts select from various search strategies,
depending on the sources, scope, and context of the information need.
Knowledge Practices


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Determine the initial scope of the task required to meet their information needs



Identify interested parties, such as scholars, organizations, governments, and industries,
which might produce information about a topic and determine how to access that
information



Utilize divergent (e.g., brainstorming) and convergent (e.g., selecting the best source)
thinking when searching



Match information needs and search strategies to search tools



Design and refine needs and search strategies, based on search results



Understand how information systems (i.e., collections of recorded information) are
organized to access relevant information



Use different searching language types (e.g., controlled vocabulary, keywords, natural
language)
461



Manage searching processes and results

Dispositions


Learners who are developing their information literate abilities do the following:



Exhibit mental flexibility and creativity



Understand that first attempts at searching do not always produce adequate results



Realize that information sources vary greatly in content and format and have varying
relevance and value, depending on the needs and nature of the search



Seek guidance from experts, such as librarians, researchers, and professionals



Recognize the value of browsing and other serendipitous methods of information
gathering



Persist in the face of search challenges, and know when enough information completes
the information task

Characteristics of Programs of Information Literacy that
Illustrate Best Practices: A Guideline Best Practices
Initiative Institute for Information Literacy
Approved by the ACRL Board, June 2003, revised January 2012.
Note: Links within the text will take you to an annotation of the highlighted terms.
Overview
The “Characteristics of Programs of Information Literacy that Illustrate Best
Practices: A Guideline” attempts to articulate elements of exemplary information literacy
programs for undergraduate students at four- and two-year institutions.
The characteristics identify and describe features notable in information literacy
programs of excellence. The characteristics are not, however, descriptive of any one
program, but rather represent a metaset of elements identified through examination of
many programs and philosophies of undergraduate information literacy.
In addition, though guided by the definitions found in the “Final Report of the
ALA Presidential Committee on Information Literacy” (1989), “A Progress Report on
Information Literacy: An Update on the American Library Association Presidential
Committee on Information Literacy: Final Report” (1998), and the “Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education” (2000), the characteristics themselves do

467

not attempt to define information literacy per se. Instead, the focus is on defining the
elements of best practices in information literacy programming.
Although an attempt was made to categorize and organize the characteristics for
ease of use and logical presentation, the order does not reflect any judgment of priority.
Purpose and Use
The characteristics are primarily intended to help those who are interested in
developing, assessing, and improving information literacy programs. This audience
includes faculty, librarians, administrators, and technology professionals, as well as
others involved in information literacy programming at a particular institution.
Individuals involved with information literacy programming are encouraged to use the
characteristics in a variety of ways. These characteristics both present and represent a set
of ideas that can be used when establishing, developing, advancing, revitalizing, or
assessing an information literacy program. The characteristics also provide a framework
within which to categorize the details of a given program and to analyze how different
program elements contribute to attaining excellence in information literacy. Because the
characteristics are descriptive in nature and the result of a meta-analysis of many
programs, they may also be useful for benchmarking program status, improvement, and
long-term development.
It is important to note, however, that no program is expected to be exemplary with
respect to all characteristics; this list is not prescriptive. Rather, individuals are
encouraged to consider their library and institutional contexts in establishing information
literacy program goals and strategies while incorporating these characteristics.
Librarians are also encouraged to make use of the “Guidelines for Instruction
Programs in Academic Libraries” for specific guidance on academic library involvement
with information literacy programs.

Document and Revision History
The characteristics were developed through a multiphase process which involved
professionals from multiple sectors of higher education, including librarians, faculty,
administrators, and professional organizations. Beginning in April 2000, suggestions for
an original draft of the characteristics were gathered through a Web-based Delphi polling
technique. Members of the Best Practices Project Team and Best Practices Advisory
Panel then wrote a document based upon these suggestions and revised it several times. A
working draft was distributed widely for comment and went through a further revision. A
penultimate draft was completed in March 2001 and was used as the basis for selecting
ten institutions for a national invitational conference on best practices in information
literacy programming, which was held in Atlanta in June 2002. As part of that meeting
the characteristics were further refined. The revisions culminated in a final edition.

473

In 2008 members of the ACRL Information Literacy Best Practices committee
(ILBP) undertook a revision of the characteristics. Committee members agreed that
certain language needed to be changed in order to better represent the current state of
information literacy at academic institutions. Members of ILBP began the process by
offering suggestions for revisions; these suggestions were then collected, keyed to the
original text, and then disseminated for comments from the ACRL membership by
sending the links to the original document and the proposed revisions to the ILI-L,
COLLIB, and CJC listservs. After collecting the comments provided by ACRL members,
the document was re-examined, and a new draft was created using the track changes
feature, which allowed readers to look at proposed changes and the differences in
meaning that would result from making those changes. The changes were then integrated
into the original document and submitted to ACRL Executive Committee for approval.

Appendix M - Definitions
For the purposes of this study the following operational terms were used:
Academic Librarian: These terms are used to describe a professional librarian that
works with students in an academic setting.
Blackboard: This is a learning management system that is used by colleges and
universities for the creation on online courses.
Exemplary: Serving as a desirable model; providing best practices approaches in a
discipline
Flipped Classroom: This is model of teaching where the instructor provides all the
students that will be attending a class with tutorials, assignments and readings to prepare
for a class before they attend it. The student are asked to prepare so that when they attend
the class, they are ready and can be fully immersed in activities related to the topics that
are taught.
The Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016): This is a
new set of information literacy standards that was filed by the Association of College and
Research Libraries Board on February 2, 2015 and adopted alongside the Association of
College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education (2000) before the latter was revoked in 2016.
Higher Learning Commission: The accreditation organization that accredits higher
learning institutions in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming.

507

Integrated Course Model: This is when instructors integrate the student's situational
factors into the course's learning goals, activities, and assessments.
Information Literacy: This is a term that was first coined by Paul Zurkowski (1974)
when, as president Information Industry Association, he presented a report to the
National Commission on Libraries and Information Science stating that “Information
Literacy is not knowledge; it is concepts or ideas that enter the person’s field of
perception, are evaluated and assimilated reinforcing or changing the individual’s
concept of reality and/or the ability to act” (Zurkowski, 1974, p. 1).
Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education: This is a set of information
literacy rules our standards that guide information literacy course development and the
development of course outcomes.
Information Literacy Librarian: These terms are used to describe a professional
librarian who designs information literacy courses and teaches information literacy to
students generally in an academic setting.
Instruction Librarian: These terms are used to describe a professional librarian who
teaches information literacy or teaches one-shot information literacy courses in an
academic setting.
Library instruction: Teaching students how to use library print and online resources.
This is not synonymous with information literacy.
Metaliteracy: Metaliteracy goes far beyond the traditional information literacy concepts
to embrace emerging technologies and social media concepts such as digital, media and
visual literacy. Learners therefore become empowered to collaborate with others to find,
use, share and produce and innovatively creatively information.

508

One-shot: An information literacy teaching opportunity that allows a librarian to visit a
professor’s class to provide library instruction only for one time. The visit might occur
for only a fraction of the full class-time or for the entire class time.
Subject-Liaison Librarian: This is a librarian that works for a specific department in the
university or college and represents that department as a subject-specialist by purchasing books,
databases and resources for the department. This librarian also works with faculty and students
from the department to provide them with subject-specific reference and instruction.

Email sent to the Listserv about the Rescinding of the
Standards
ACRL Board Takes Action on Information Literacy Standards
June 25, 2016 ACRL Board of Directors
Today the ACRL Board of Directors voted to rescind the Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education. The Board will continue to discuss next
steps to support all academic librarians working with information literacy at its public
meeting on Monday afternoon at the ALA Annual Conference in Orlando.
It is important to acknowledge the groundbreaking work embodied in the Information
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, approved by the Board in 2000, in
moving the profession forward. These Standards were co-developed with and
subsequently endorsed by the American Association for Higher Education and the
Council for Independent Colleges.
ACRL recognizes the tremendous contributions of the Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education and the transformational work of many ACRL members
working with them. Those Standards paved the way for information literacy to become
common language in many general education requirements and informed many regional
and subject-oriented accreditation bodies. The Board will continue to seek input from the
profession as the process moves forward.
On June 27, 2016 the ACRL committee published the following in the ACRL Insider:
http://www.acrl.ala.org/acrlinsider/about

The ACRL Board of Directors continued its discussion about the Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education at its meeting on Monday, June 27, 2016. The ACRL Board
recognizes that there are librarians who are seeking guidance for using the Framework now that
the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education have been rescinded. A
number of ACRL groups and individuals are already working with the Framework to develop
resources that will address the needs of librarians who previously relied on the Standards,
including the ACRL Framework Advisory Board, the Student Learning and Information Literacy
Committee, and the Information Literacy Framework and Standards Committee.
The ACRL Framework Sandbox, which will be available Fall 2016, will provide a space for
librarians to share examples of how they are using the Framework. This will include such things
as lesson plans, rubrics, assessments, and learning outcomes. These resources will be tangible
tools that librarians can adapt to their work. ACRL interview comments are developing disciplinespecific companion documents that address the need for learning outcomes and assessment. It is
the Board’s intention to ensure that tools are available to assist all librarians in the practical
application of the Framework.

14.8 Procedures for Rescinding Standards and Guidelines
When an ACRL committee or section determines that the useful life of an ACRL
standard or guideline has ended, the following procedures are used to officially rescind
the document. These procedures apply only to rescinding a standard or guideline when no
revision of the existing document is planned.
1. The committee or section that promulgated the standard or guideline may forward a
request to rescind the document to the SC chair at its own initiative or as a result of a
contact from the SC liaison.
2. Before the next ALA conference or midwinter meeting, the committee or section
executive committee distributes the announcement of the intended rescission through
those email distribution lists consulted by practitioners in the area covered by the
standard or guideline. Should the committee or section chose to do so, it may also
schedule a discussion period at its meeting at the next ALA conference or midwinter
meeting.
3. To ensure wide and timely notice to the membership, the committee or section seeking
rescission will publish an announcement of its intent in C&RL News and in electronic
media, including: (1) the reasons for the decision to rescind, (2) the name and email
address of a contact person to receive comment in advance of the next ALA conference
or midwinter meeting, and (3), should the committee or section choose to hold a hearing,
an invitation for comment at the hearing during the next ALA conference or midwinter
meeting.
4. Having gathered member comments in this manner, the committee or section forwards
a report of the discussion with a final recommendation to the SC chair and SC liaison.
5. The SC acts on the request for rescission at the next ALA conference or midwinter
meeting. If the SC approves the rescission, this recommendation is forwarded to the
ACRL Board for final approval.
6. The ACRL Board either approves the rescission, or the Board directs SC to work with

511

the responsible ACRL unit to ensure that the information in the standard or guideline is
somehow retained, publicized, and made available.
