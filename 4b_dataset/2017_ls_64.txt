This study investigated how the school librarian acts as a change agent for effective
integration of technology in the school curriculum. Four teachers from a midwestern junior high
school participated in this project. The research was conducted as a case study using grounded
theory methods for generating theory and analyzing data. To inform the study, Rogers’s
diffusion theory was also applied. The following research questions helped to guide the study:
How is a school librarian a change agent for improving technology practices in a junior high
school? What are strategies that allow the school librarian to act as an agent of change for
meaningful technology integration in the junior high school setting with teachers? What are
strategies that allow the school librarian to act as an agent of change for meaningful technology
integration in the junior high school setting with students? After collection, the data were
analyzed through qualitative procedures which revealed seven themes: Learning, Resources,
Cross-curricular, Attitudes, Collaboration, Assessment and Time Management. Applying
grounded theory, the DELTA Framework (Digital Tools, Engagement, Librarians, Teachers, All
Learners) theory was generated.

INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY
“Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones
we’ve been waiting for. We are the change we seek.” (Barack Obama)
This dissertation examines how the school librarian acts as a change agent for effective
integration of technology in the school curriculum. Junior high school, special education, and
language arts, specifically, will be discussed. Participants from technology and graphic arts
classes and the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID, 2017) program are also
included in this study. According to the Standards for the 21st-Century Learner, “School
libraries are essential to the development of learning skills,” which puts the school librarian in a
distinctive position to make positive changes within a school culture (Johnston, 2012, p. 4). The
nature of the job calls for interaction with the entire school community, which can allow for
creating change.
What kinds of changes would a school librarian be able to attain? One aspect of the
school librarian’s responsibilities, along with keeping current in children’s and young adult
literature, is to be familiar with, or cognizant of how to engage students and teachers in
technology integration activities. Technology integration can still be a problem today (Russell,
O'Dwyer, Bebell, & Tao, 2007). For example, some teachers are overwhelmed and leadership for
obtaining technological assistance is not clear (Johnston, 2012).

2
In the late 1980s and 1990s, it could be said that schools were lacking in equipment,
training opportunities, or funding (Johnston, 2012). After schools purchased equipment, they
also needed to obtain internet service. Then costly software had to be acquired. The process for
purchasing software could be daunting in that it had to be previewed and tested before ultimately
being adopted (Johnston, 2012). Then staff development for using this technology needed to be
planned and implemented.
Today, most schools have technology equipment and access to the internet. Web 2.0
technologies allow for teachers and students to use internet tools for writing, sharing and creating
videos and photographs, programming and so much more. Teachers and students may find free
web programs online that can be used to create thoughtful, student-centered products for free or
for a small cost (Ertmer, Ottenbriet-Leftwich, Sadik, Sendurur, & Sendurur, 2012). If this is the
case, why is effective technology integration still a problem in the 21st century? In a study done
by Russell and colleagues (2007) it was found that there was discomfort with using technology
tools until teachers were comfortable with the curriculum and with the particular technology
tools available in the school. This occurred regardless of the number of years taught by the
teacher. Since new teachers had a high comfort level using technology in their personal lives,
there was an assumption that they would have technology expertise in the classroom as well.
Nevertheless, new teachers were also found to need training and support with technology use in
their classroom teaching (Russell et al., 2007).
In Inan and Lowther’s study (2009), an important factor in determining technology
integration practices was teacher confidence in using computers. There was a positive effect if
the teacher felt competent using technology. However, in reviewing the ages and tenure of

3
teachers, negative effects were also observed. The longer an instructor had a career in education,
the less comfortable the teacher was with integrating technology (Inan & Lowther, 2009). The
problem explored during this study addressed these questions: How is a school librarian a change
agent for improving technology practices in a junior high school? What are strategies that allow
the school librarian to act as an agent of change for meaningful technology integration in the
junior high school setting with teachers? What are strategies that allow the school librarian to act
as an agent of change for meaningful technology integration in the junior high school setting
with students?

Purpose
As technology evolves, new devices, tablets, and smartphones enter the
consumer marketplace daily (Oberg, 2010). Because it may be difficult to keep up with the
technological advances, technology integration in schools continues to be a 21st-century
challenge. Why is this so? In this research, I examine the role of school librarians and their
unique position for acting as change agents in technology integration in the junior high school
setting. Rogers’s diffusion theory was explored as a framework for creating change. I also
examine how school librarians are prepared to teach students 21st-century skills. With a
knowledgeable school librarian, successful changes can occur. The goal for school libraries is to
help improve teaching and learning for teachers, students, and the school community. The school
library, as a result, becomes an essential arena for reform and change (Oberg, 2010).

4
Statement of the Problem
Late in the 20th century and early 21st century we saw the onset of the first generation
internet, or Web 1.0 (Anderson, 2013). The internet brought a multitude of digital opportunities
for many people. It made its way through personal and professional lives, including those of
educators. The early web brought sites that were viewed for information, much like a digital
bulletin board; advertisements, encyclopedia articles, personal websites and online museums.
Since the year 2000, a powerful trend has occurred; the internet has brought a more dynamic,
interactive and collective way to use online applications. This second-generation internet, Web
2.0 (Anderson, 2013), has become a space that allows individuals to interact and connect in a
social manner (Howland, Jonassen, & Marra, 2012). Using online communities, people share and
collaborate. Web 2.0 spaces consist of wikis, blogs, podcasts and social networking sites
(Howland et al., 2012). With such sites, individuals may communicate and collaborate to
achieve a goal socially or academically. Additionally, online applications such as the Google
Apps for Education, or GSuite; (Google, 2017), Animoto (Animoto, 2017), and Voicethread
(Brunvand & Byrd, 2011) can be used to create multimedia projects, artistic products, music
videos or collaborative slide shows (Howland et al., 2012). School librarians, acting as change
agents, can incorporate these and other digital tools as strategies to help students learn (Harada &
Hughes Hassell, 2007).
In Standards for the 21st-Century Learner, the importance of having knowledge and skills
in technology is declared. The standards outlined are a guide for helping school librarians and
classroom teachers educate students on the digital skills needed for success in a connected,
technological society (AASL, 2007). The ease of using Web 2.0 applications as a strategy will

5
allow for learners to create authentic products to share with others. As a result, the experience
students have creating online projects such as podcasts and videoconferences help to build
meaningful learning (Howland et al., 2012).
We, as educators, observe students work and learn in various settings, and we see that
students are learning not only in the formal setting of schools but also in informal settings
outside of school. Students have been empowered to make choices about when and where they
are learning. An example would include downloading a drawing application to a cell phone or
tablet and then learning how to use it (Greenhow, Robelia, & Hughes, 2009). Applications from
sociocultural activity and situated learning theory are reflected in this kind of independent
behavior by students (Vygotsky, 1978). Barron (2006), additionally, discusses the idea of
learning ecologies in relation to where students are learning. Therefore, learning ecologies are
defined as “physical or virtual spaces that provide opportunities for learning” (p.195). As a
result, using Web 2.0 applications offers students the opportunity to learn when and where they
want within the context of learning ecologies (Barron, 2006).
At the center of my study were four junior high teachers. I worked with these teachers
and their students to utilize digital tools during instruction. These tools integrated Web 2.0
technology such as Animoto into the students’ curricular projects. An example of a completed
project included movie making with iMovie. Final products were shared on the internet through
online tools using social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and the school web site.

6
Significance of Study
This research study is important to the field of instructional technology because the
library media specialist is involved in all aspects of the school curriculum with all students and
teachers (Hughes-Hassell & Harada, 2007). School librarians can bring forth strategies for
change by using digital tools with teachers and students. An example would be using Web 2.0
tools. Web 2.0 applications and other digital tools can be valuable resources to both students and
teachers. As such, the flexible nature of online applications allows for sharing, creating and
collaborating in a digital manner (Harada & Hughes Hassell, 2007). Web 2.0 applications and
other technologies provide for productive tools during instruction. Such applications include
databases, word processors and spreadsheets. Students may also use these same digital tools in
their learning and in expressing what they have learned. It is important to be able to share ideas
using various technologies, including Web 2.0 applications, thus helping teachers explore and
express their ideas to students. As a result, with the introduction of online applications and
other digital tools, students in the school are engaged and enjoying creating projects to show
what they have learned (Harada & Hughes Hassell, 2007). Additionally, some online
applications such as Google GSuite are offered for free (Google, 2017).
The integration of digital tools by school librarians is beneficial for initiating change. A
reason for this is due to the cooperative nature of these online tools. This allows for access to
digital collaboration and community (Rheingold, 2012). Educators, students and private
individuals are creating products and sharing them via Web 2.0 applications. This sharing is for
us to take and learn from and then reproduce for the creation of a better product. By
incorporating such digital tools into the curriculum, the library media specialist can act as a

7
conduit to all involved: students and teachers. Various ways to collaborate with teachers include
gathering in professional learning communities, attending grade-level meetings, and meeting one
to one.

Researcher Bias and Positionality

I began my educational career as a teacher for elementary-aged students. It was during
this time that I discovered the power of digital tools. Students became motivated to study and
learn when technology integration occurred. I observed collaboration and cooperation between
students as they used computers to complete assignments and to investigate topics. As I noticed
the enjoyment my students were experiencing utilizing technology into their work, I also noticed
many hesitant teachers.
I am currently a school librarian. I decided to become a school librarian because of my
interest in literature. I also have a passion for instructional technology.

As a school librarian, I

am enthusiastic about assisting both students and teachers with integrating digital tools for
teaching and learning. I am especially interested in helping teachers who are tentative about

8
using technology tools. I believe these tentative teachers are in need of support. I am in a
position to help teachers and students utilize digital tools. This support is offered to both
motivated and tentative teachers. My purpose with this study is not necessarily to document if a
school librarian can act as a change agent for integrating technology, but to document how a
school librarian can bring about change.

Theoretical Frameworks and Constructs
As a school librarian working as a change agent for improving technology integration
practices in my school and school district, I believe the change model theory in Rogers’s
Diffusion of Innovations (2003) is appropriate. As a teacher, constructivist views are practiced
in my teaching. It is through these lenses that research was reviewed. Constructs to be discussed
included technology integration practices and constructivism together with junior high school
teachers in a Grades 6-8 school. The purpose of the study was to see how the school librarian
acts as a change agent to improve technology practices with the integration of digital tools.
According to Rogers (2003), “Diffusion is the process for which an innovation is
communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system” (p. 5).
Rogers explains that the innovation does not necessarily need to be “new” as defined by time,
but perhaps new as perceived by the group. I believe that in relation to technology integration in
schools, Web 2.0 technologies are a new trend. As new tools, such as new databases and mobile
applications, arrive on the educational scene, I have, through past observations, seen that some
may be intimidating to certain teachers as they work with students.

9
Additionally, Rogers (2003) continues to discuss the notion that communicating through
channels is a way to send messages from one to another. In reference to technology integration,
how messages are sent to the school community is very important. Careful planning needs to
occur in order for the proper messages to be sent. Any miscommunication of the message may
hinder the adoption process. Consequently, Rogers (2003) describes the element of time in the
diffusion process as important to how long it takes for an adoption to be accepted or rejected by a
group or social system. Rogers states that researchers frequently overlook the element of time
(Rogers, 2003).
Another element as discussed by Rogers (2003) is the social system. The social system is
the group or organization in which the diffusion occurs. It is in this group where we find the
“change agent” or opinion leader making a difference.

This person is the influential individual

who seeks out desirable development for the agency, group, or organization. The change agent
receives help from the other opinion leaders in a social system that is looking to make changes.
Opinion leaders will be discussed later when discussing adopter categories. It was my aim
during this study to collaborate with teachers as a change agent for improving technology
integration practices.
Consequences, an additional element proposed by Rogers (2003), occur after the
diffusion process. They are the result of the adoption or rejection of the innovation (Rogers,
2003).
During the diffusion process, the key players are called “adopters.” The adopter
categories as explained by Rogers (2003) are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late
majority and laggards. Innovators have the vision for the changes to be made in the

10
organization. They are the risk takers who see benefits to the organization if changes are made
for the good of the group. One of the characteristics of the innovator is the social status in the
group. The innovators are outliers in the social system and do not have the social clout to make
the organizational changes on their own. However, the innovator is highly intelligent. So
innovators work closely with early adopters. Early adopters are the strong leaders in the
organization. They make their opinions known and have the social clout for making changes.
Early adopters take the message from the innovator and spread the message to others. The early
adopters will agree upon changes when they see evidence that changes are for the good of the
group. However, they will not initiate making changes (Rogers, 2003). The late adopters will
make changes only after they see there has been success with the change and only if change is
inevitable. The laggards are the skeptics of the social system. They are resistant to change.
They will change only if they are mandated to do so (Rogers, 2003).
Travis (2008) employs change agent theory in her case study using university librarians
as agents of change for integrating information literacy into a university’s school curriculum.
Change agent theory in this case study is not only used as a theoretical framework, but it is also
used as a planning tool. The context in which change agent theory is used in Travis’s case study
makes for a powerful model for my own research.
Constructivist theory was also examined in that it underpins research done in the field of
educational technology. Duffy and Jonassen (1992) explain constructivism in that we make
meaning of our real-world experiences. Ertmer et al. (2001) studied the idea that exemplary
technology-using teachers employ constructivist theory philosophy. Becker and Riel (1999)
declare constructivist teaching practice as planning lessons around student and teacher interests.

11
In addition, constructivist teachers work together in cooperating groups and are idea driven and
self-assessing as they learn together.
The research I conducted used case study and grounded theory methods. The use of
focus group interviews, individual interviews and observations as found in grounded theory were
utilized in this study. Glaser and Straus (2012) introduced grounded theory in 1967. Using
grounded theory, researchers examine data collected in an effort to generate a new theory or
concept through coding. Diagrams or other visualizations can be used to explain the theme
developed from data collected (Creswell, 2008).
Glaser and Holton (2004) state that when grounded theory is explained, it is commonly
merged with other qualitative data analysis methods. They argue that although there are
commonalities between these approaches, grounded theory can stand on its own as a system for
generating theory (Glaser & Holton, 2004). Since Merriam (1998) points out that case study can
be used or combined with grounded theory and other qualitative research procedures, I chose to
conduct my research project as a case study for collecting data in order to generate a theory by
using grounded theory methods.

Assumptions
My assumptions were that the school under study had computers and internet access for
students and teachers to complete the work involved. I also assumed that students and teachers
would be able to navigate through software programs, including those on the internet, well
enough to participate in this project.

12
Delimitations
The study was done in a school which housed sixth, seventh and eighth graders in a
midwestern state approximately 30 miles west of a large metropolitan city. The school had
approximately 800 students. The setting of the study primarily occurred in the classrooms of
four teacher participants from grade levels six, seven and eight. The teachers had backgrounds
in English language arts, special education, technology, and art. Other sites in the school,
however, such as the library and computer lab were also utilized throughout this project.

Limitations
This case study was done at one school. The number of participants was, therefore,
limited. In addition, Itook part not only as a researcher but also as a participant. Participation in
the study was voluntary by all members.

Definition of Terms
Blog: Blog is short for web log. Internet users log their experiences for sharing with the
world via the World Wide Web (Solomon, 2010).
Community of learners: Community of learners refers to social networks and
collaboration done through the use of the internet by using a variety of available software tools
(Solomon, 2010).

13
Cross-curriculum: Cross-curriculum is about interdisciplinary studies in which students
partake in lessons which cover a variety of subjects such as English, social studies and math.
Other terms used for this concept include thematic units and integrated lessons (Applebee,
Adler, & Flihan, 2007).
Web 2.0: Web 2.0 is a reference to the internet resource in which the end user can build
and create a product using online software. Sometimes these activities are done in a
collaborative, social manner (Reiser & Dempsey, 2013).
WWW: WWW refers to the World Wide Web, which is an expression used for the
internet (Reiser & Dempsey, 2013).

Conclusion
This dissertation investigated how the school librarian acts as a change agent for effective
technology integration in the school curriculum. Four junior high school teachers participated in
this research study. The study was done at one midwestern junior high school. The research was
performed using qualitative methods. Case study and grounded theory procedures were
implemented in this study (Glaser & Strauss, 2012; Merriam, 1998). Rogers’s diffusion theory
informed this investigation (Rogers, 2003).

LITERATURE REVIEW
“You must be the change you wish to see in the world.” (Mahatma Gandhi)

As a school librarian, I have been in the fortunate position to work with the entire school
community; students, teachers, administrators, parents and support staff. It is from this
community that I have gained my inspirations. It has been my passion as an educator to help
students learn. With these feelings in mind, it is my mission to help the school community
understand the benefits of their school library. Others before me have had a similar mission. In
this literature review, I would like to outline studies that show how school libraries and school
librarians matter. This review will also include studies relating to change agency to identify the
processes and roles throughout the investigation. Since research shows there is hesitation by
educators to incorporate technology into the curriculum, Rogers’s diffusion theory, as a method
to overcome that hesitation, will be discussed. Studies addressing constructivism and grounded
theory will also be examined.

Roles and Influences of School Librarians
According to Butler (2015), the librarian’s roles are vital for helping students learn. The
word “roles” is intended to be plural, in that the school librarian has many. Not only are roles

15
numerous but so are the ways in which these educators are addressed. School librarians may be
labeled school library media specialists, library information specialists, and library directors, just
to mention a few titles (Butler, 2015). However, regardless of the number of titles this position
has, the job is the same. The school librarian is in the school to help students learn, to support
other educators, and to offer expertise on print and technological resources. Collaborating with
other educators, the school librarian provides access to materials for the school community
beyond the textbook and basal (Hopkins, 1998). Alas, school librarian jobs are being cut due to
budget woes throughout our nation. However, the school librarian position is far from being a
luxury. Librarians engage in collaboration for the sake of student learning by teaming up with
other teachers. School library educators have the expertise to teach the 21st-century student the
skills necessary for competing in today’s world (Dow, 2013).
School librarians can be leaders involved in curricular activities such as committees and
teacher collaboration meetings, as role models embracing change for the sake of student
learning (Branch & Oberg, 2001). In fact, Znnuda and Harada (2008) proposed that school
librarians should be considered learning specialists in light of the rich knowledge they possess on
curriculum, and learning, an example being that since school librarians work on building the
school library collection, knowledge about the curriculum is essential. In addition, Van Deusen
(1996) discussed the concept of school librarian as instructional consultant. In her article, she
reports on a case study that describes the school library media specialist and classroom teachers
working together as a teaching team. The findings (Van Deusen, 1996) showed that the school
library media specialist was a valuable member of the team as both an “insider” and an

16
“outsider”; the school librarian was involved with contributing lessons by sharing ideas and
resources. As an “insider,” the school librarian was involved with contributing to lessons by
sharing ideas and resources. Additionally, as an “outsider,” the school library media specialist
was able to view elements of the lessons in an objective manner (Van Deusen, 1996).

Lance Studies
For more than a decade, Keith Curry Lance and his colleagues have worked to show the
value of school libraries through various studies performed across the nation (Scholastic, 2016).
Scholastic (2016) summarized studies done in twenty states. Accordingly, these studies reflected
findings showing improvement in student achievement as well as positive collaborative efforts
between the school librarian and teachers. Overall, the school librarian brings expertise in
literacy, technology and professionalism (Scholastic, 2016). This positive impact comes in spite
of wealth or poverty in the community (Lance & Hofschire, 2012). In his article regarding the
school library program and the impact it has, Lance (2002) reports that the implications from his
study showing the need for proper funding to support a full library media program, including
full-time, accredited staff and funds for print and electronic resources. In addition, the school
librarian should show initiative for bringing resources, programs and technology leadership to
the school library (Lance, 2002).

Change Agents
The charge for school librarians is to be a change agent not only for the school library but
the school as a whole (Oberg, 2010). Hughes-Hassell and Harada (2007) discuss the importance

17
for school librarians to be change agents. These two researchers emphasize that change is
constant. It not only occurs within the context of school policy and governmental legislature, but
within our societal outlook (Hughes-Hassell & Harada, 2007). In addition, Hughes-Hassell and
Harada (2007) indicate that school librarians have an overview perspective of the school’s and
district’s curriculum. The school librarians work with all students, educators, and administrators
throughout the building, as well as across the district. School librarians involve themselves in
collaborative efforts as problem solvers, mentors, and co-teachers. Since they are not in a
supervisory role, school librarians are able to view classroom situations objectively, assisting
classroom teachers needing a sounding board. To be effective change agents, school librarians
must remember to consider the people being affected by the changes being made. Being a
proactive leader and promoting how the school library supports student learning are also an
essential elements for school librarians to possess (Hughes-Hassell & Harada, 2007).
Advocating as a change agent for students, teachers, administrators and the community as a
whole promotes positive, professional relationships for school librarians (Harada & Hughes
Hassell, 2007). As pointed out by Oberg (2010), the objective for school libraries is to allow for
improvements in teaching and learning throughout the school organization. It is a
knowledgeable school librarian who can bring about positive changes for the sake of an
academic community (Oberg, 2010).

Librarians as Change Agents Through Using Digital Tools
Johnston (2012) states that school librarians are vital to making contributions a
technology integration leaders. The purpose of Johnston’s study was to determine which

18
enablers existed for supporting school librarians in this leadership role. A support to the school
librarian was considered an enabler. The study also examined barriers in reference to technology
integration. An unsupportive teacher not interested with integrating digital tools would serve as
an example of a barrier. Johnston used Zinn’s (1997) distributed leadership theory as the
framework for analyzing the study. Distributed leadership is the concept in which several people
work together to help achieve a common goal by pooling their knowledge and expertise (Zinn,
1997). In Johnston’s study, National Board Certified1 school librarians were surveyed with
questions surrounding four domains: 1) people and interpersonal relationships, 2) institutional
structures, 3) personal considerations and commitments, and 4) intellectual and psychosocial
characteristics.
Johnston’s study (2012) found that enabling, as a factor, was strong in domain one, or
relationships. If the school librarian had a relationship with a supportive principal, it helped the
librarian to facilitate technology integration activities. Consequently, a supportive principal is
one who encourages professional development, facilitates funding for the library, and encourages
the librarian to take a leadership role in the school (Johnston, 2012).

According to Johnson

(2012), the supportive principal also seeks out expertise from the librarian on technology-related
issues. In turn, a barrier to technology integration was a non-supportive principal. Few
respondents reported this to be the case (Johnston, 2012). A non-supportive principal excluded
the school librarian from decision making.

Professional relationships with teachers also proved

to be important. Having a respectful, collegial relationship with classroom teachers helped to
enable the school librarian’s goal for integrating technology in the classroom. Support from

1

Additional professional development for reaching national professional licensure.

19
other school librarians (professional organizations and other schools) was also important.
Respondents reported that they were able to further their cause with a strong community of
librarians for collaboration (Johnston, 2012).
Barriers found in domain one included unsupportive classroom teachers; i.e., respondents
stated that some teachers just wanted to be left alone. Some of the classroom teachers were also
unwilling to collaborate to effect change. The instructional technologist was also reported to
sometimes be a barrier to change. It was found that there were often feelings of competition
between the librarian and instructional technologist (Johnston, 2012).
In domain two, Johnston’s (2012) research questions involved dealing with institutional
structures. These questions were formulated around policies and procedures that are evident in
what creates an institution. Barriers for allowing school librarians to promote technology
integration activities in schools were discovered as a result. Constraints included problems with
committee work, funding, schedules, resources, and time in general. There were also barriers
when it came to committee work. Some school librarians reported that they were excluded from
committee work. This prevented them from contributing to the conversations that dealt with
decision making regarding technology integration activities (Johnston, 2012). Time, or lack
thereof, was another major barrier issue. Respondents reported that they were pressed for time to
teach. Or they were assigned to teach subjects not in their area, therefore requiring additional
time for preparation. Time constraints were also exacerbated by the lack of paraprofessional
help. Oftentimes, the school librarian was required to put time into clerical duties rather than in
planning technology integration activities. Substandard resources such as older, defunct
equipment and out-of-date software were also considered barriers (Johnston, 2012). Thus, time

20
that could be spent on technology integration planning was instead consumed with
troubleshooting, often required when using older hardware or software (Johnston, 2012).
Domain three dealt with personal considerations such as financial welfare, family
relationships, and personal time away from work. There were very few responses that
considered this domain (Johnston, 2012). The most frequently reported enablers for helping to
facilitate the technology integration role for school librarians was in domain four.
Domain four questions dealt with psychosocial characteristics. Respondents felt a strong
sense of obligation to continue with computer-based activities. Even with barriers, the school
librarian felt that it was best for the sake of the students to move forward with activities
involving technology integration (Johnston, 2012). Johnston’s study (2012) also reports on the
conditions that school librarians have with enablers (such as resources, time and funding) and
barriers to technology integration.
I have been a school librarian for several years and have been in several frustrating
situations as posed by Johnson’s (2012) report. For example, barriers such as non-supportive
administrators and anxious teachers have prevented or hindered the work of effective, efficient
technology integration. However, it is important to be able to keep a focus on the goal, e.g., to
help students learn, especially if computer-based activities are appropriate tools to offer students.
Additional barriers to integrating technology may be related to emerging Web 2.0
technologies, according to Hanson-Baldauf and Hassell (2009). Hanson-Baldauf and Hassell
explore how preservice school librarians perceive their level of technology competency as well
as school library education programs and how technology, or information and communication
technologies (ICTS), are integrated into instruction (Hanson-Baldauf & Hassell, 2009).

21
Hanson-Baldauf and Hassell (2009) focus on the importance of school librarians’ taking a
proactive role in promoting technology integration in K-12 schools. Funds have often been
invested for increasing the number of computers and other technological equipment into schools
(Hanson-Baldauf & Hassell, 2009). Nevertheless, technology integration continues at a slow
pace. Students today are in a position where using technology is not a problem. Our “wired”
youth are competent with using mobile devices.

However, a recent study of college freshman

revealed that students do not have the skills necessary for competition in the global workplace
(Hanson-Baldauf & Hassell, 2009). In their study, Hanson-Baldauf and Hassell (2009) explore
how school librarians can take a leadership role in improving conditions in the integration of
digital tools. These researchers first want to know if school librarians are prepared to deliver
computer-based activities into their instruction. Preservice school librarians were surveyed on
the use of Web 2.0 tools such as wikis, blogs and podcasts in the Hanson-Baldauf and Hassell
(2009) study. Although the preservice school librarians believe it is important to integrate
technology into their teaching, Hanson-Baldauf and Hassell (2009) discovered that the preservice
school librarians are not prepared to do so. This becomes, therefore, another barrier for change.
Suggestions such as requiring the use of Web 2.0 tools in authentic learning environments by the
preservice school librarians could help with preparation. Encouraging library media faculty to
mentor students and to model using Web 2.0 tools were also mentioned as suggestions (HansonBaldauf & Hassell, 2009).
Hanson-Baldauf and Hassell (2009) found an interesting phenomenon in discovering that
the preservice school librarians were not prepared to teach using technology. Emerging
technologies were presented either in readings or were modeled by a professor. Hands-on

22
experience with new technologies was therefore limited (Hanson-Baldauf & Hassell, 2009).
Although enablers are in place for supporting technology integration, barriers still need to be
addressed (Travis, 2008).
Additionally, benefits from Web 2.0 programs also need to be considered for school
libraries. In a study done with special-needs students using the Web 2.0 application,
Voicethread, students were able to show their understanding of a story by using tools provided
by Voicethread (Brunvand & Byrd, 2011). Voicethread is an online program in which the user
uploads photos and video to be shown in a slideshow format. The creator of the project as well
as others can add voice and text, allowing for a collaborative effort. The students were
motivated to carry out the Voicethread task until it was finished (Brunvand & Byrd, 2011).

Constructivism
Furthermore, another barrier to change for integrating technology into the curriculum
may have little to do with competency using technological tools and more to do with the
teacher’s pedagogical beliefs. Ertmer (2005) examines how teacher beliefs may influence
classroom teaching methods relating to incorporating technology into instructional applications.
Ertmer considers that beliefs are highly personal and may be without logic. When studied
teachers reported technology uses in their classrooms, the statements were inconsistent with
practice (Ertmer, 2005). These teachers felt their pedagogical philosophies were closely related
to that of constructivist theorists, providing for student-centered instruction. However, according
to Ertmer (2005), when it came to technology activities, students were engaged in activities that

23
were varied, not just student centered. For example, some activities were tutorial or practice
based, rather than authentic, real-world tasks (Ertmer, 2005).
As found by Ertmer (2005), if technology is presented to teachers in a way that that
shows teachers technology will be beneficial to meeting their goals, said teachers may be more
responsive to change. If the technology is presented as another pedagogical tool, teachers may
feel that more is being added to what they are already required to do. Professional development
suggestions for helping educators ease into new technological territory were additionally
discussed in Ertmer’s (2005) study. Strategies for change included (1) forming small study
groups for learning new pedagogical methods, (2) introducing newer technologies in a gradual
fashion, and (3) providing support for teachers as they develop new skills (Ertmer, 2005).
In my own teaching, I found Ertmer’s (2005) recommendation for professional
development to be valuable. Ertmer (2005) suggests having teachers gradually introduce the use
of digital tools into their activities, in that starting small could prove to be beneficial to learning.
Observing teachers doing computer activities with students was another suggestion.
Additionally, professional learning communities focused on technology integration idea
exchange could provide support to teachers (Ertmer, 2005). However, it is not always possible
to provide structured training for teachers in instructional technology. The reasons are many and
include funding, time, and interest (Ertmer, 2005). Therefore, as a school librarian, I try to find
creative ways to help teachers learn technology skills for effectively integrating digital tool use
into their teaching.
Becker and Riel (1999) describe teaching practice as designing lessons around student
and teacher interests, forming cooperative groups, and incorporating idea-driven activities and

24
self-assessment. Subsequently, Ertmer,et al. (2001) examine constructivist theory concepts
within the context of technology integration by teachers. Ertmer et al. (2001) also explore the
idea that exemplary technology-using teachers tend to be those who practice constructivist theory
philosophy. In Ertmer et al.’s (2012) study, however, they discover that technology use does not
necessarily reflect constructivist practice, but instead reflects a combination of constructivist
(using a student-centered approach) and traditional (using a teacher-directed approach)
methodology. In a more recent study, Ertmer et al. (Ertmer et al., 2012) revisit the question as
to how pedagogical beliefs align with technology practices. The report explains how teachers in
K-12 schools with student-centered views are observed teaching technology integrated lessons.
Many of these lessons involved Web 2.0 technologies and other digital tools such as blogs and
wikis. The outcome of this later study finds that teachers’ practices and beliefs are more aligned
today perhaps because digital tools, such as those in Web 2.0 technologies, lend themselves to
being used in constructivist activities (Ertmer et al., 2012) . Accordingly, constructivist views
were also a good indicator of the level of technology use by the teacher (Ertmer et al., 2012).

Diffusion of Innovations, Everett M. Rogers and Change Theory
According to Rogers (2003), “Diffusion is the process for which an innovation is
communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system” (p. 5).
Rogers explains that the innovation does not necessarily need to be “new” as defined by time,
but perhaps new as perceived by the group. I believe in relation to technology integration in
schools, Web 2.0 technologies and other digital, mobile tools are a new trend. As new tools
arrive on the educational scene, I have, through past observations, seen that some may be

25
intimidating to teachers as they work with students. Hence, Rogers’s (2003) theory has
informed my study.
Rogers (2003) proceeds to discuss the notion that communicating through channels is a
way to send messages from one to another. In reference to technology integration, how
messages are sent to the school community is very important. Careful planning needs to occur
for the proper messages to be sent. Any miscommunication of the message may hinder the
adoption process.
Additionally, decision maker experiences are outlined by Rogers (2003) in the five-step
Innovation-Decision process (Figure 1). The five steps are listed as follows: 1) Knowledge, 2)
Persuasion, 3) Decision, 4) Implementation, 5) Confirmation. The element of Knowledge is the
revelation of an idea or innovation an individual has discovered. Persuasion is when the
individual believes if the innovation is either a positive or negative idea. The Decision element
covers individual decisions to adopt or reject the innovation. If the person decides to adopt the
innovation, Rogers calls this Implementation. Finally, Confirmation is described as the
evaluation of the adoption by the individual. It is this change process that informed my study
(Rogers, 2003).

26

Figure 1. Five-step Innovation-Decision process (Rogers, 2003).

Rogers’s (2003) description of the audience, or population, considering an adoption (in
my study a technology adoption) also provided insight to my study. When a population is
reviewing an innovation to adopt, Rogers (2003) breaks down this population into sub-groups.
The description of these sub-groups represents the ideal example. They are as follows: 1)
Innovators, 2) Early Adopters, 3) Early Majority, 4) Late Majority, 5) Laggards. Innovators are
just that, innovators. They are considered the smallest sub-group in the population; 2.5 % of a
given population considering an adoption, according to Rogers (2003), are Innovators. These
visionary individuals possess ideas that are cutting-edge. Since this group is small, they may not
have a significant effect regarding adoption over the larger group. However, these people will
find other colleagues, called Early Adopters, with whom to collaborate. The Early Adopters,
according to Rogers (2003), make up about 13.5% of the population within the social group.

27
Innovators depend on Early Adopters to get the adoption message across to this larger audience.
If the Early Adopter is accepting of the adoption, this person will enthusiastically spread the
message to the greater group. This attitude makes the Early Adopter a willing risk-taker
(Rogers, 2003). The Early Majority are the practical individuals in the social group. This is a
larger sub-group made up of 34% of the adopters (Rogers, 2003). These people will consider an
adoption if the methods have been proven. This sub-group is important because it is about onethird of the adopting population. Although these individuals do not lead during an adoption
process, they will follow along if the adoption proves to be beneficial. Rogers (2003) describes
the Late Majority as skeptics. The Late Majority is also a large sub-group, consisting of 34% of
the adopting audience. These conservative individuals will begin to accept the adoption ideas
only after the majority of the group has done so (Rogers, 2003). The final sub-group as
described by Rogers (2003) are the Laggards. Laggards tend to be traditional individuals. Their
point of reference when considering adopting a new idea is the past. This group is comfortable
with “doing what we’ve always done” (Rogers, 2003). Figure 2 is a graphic representation of
these sub-groups along an adoption innovation curve.

28

Figure 2. Rogers’s adoption innovation curve (Rogers, 2003).

Subsequently, Rogers (2003) describes the element of Time in the diffusion process as
important to how long it takes for an adoption to be accepted or rejected by a group or social
system. Rogers states that researchers frequently overlook the element of time (Rogers, 2003).

Studies Using Rogers’s Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DOI)
Surry
Surry and Farquhar (1997) report in their article reasons for instructional technologists to adopt
Rogers’s diffusion of innovations (2003), or DOI, as a process for documenting institutional
change and adoption. First, it is unknown as to why it is difficult for instructional technologists
to utilize adoption for their products (Surry & Farquhar, 1997). Having a system in place, such
as DOI, may provide answers that will help facilitate product adoption. In addition, according to
Surry and Farquhar (1997), instructional technology is in and of itself innovative. If an
instructional technologist understands the diffusion process, s/he may be better prepared to
effectively facilitate adoption. As a result of this better understanding, further innovations may

29
occur to help guide pedagogical and technological advances by instructional technologists (Surry
& Farquhar, 1997).
Surry et al. (2002) developed a framework for integrating technology called RIPPLES.
The model is based on Rogers’s diffusion theory (2003) for creating change. RIPPLES is an
acronym representing elements of the model: resources, infrastructure, people, policies, learning,
and evaluation. There needs to be a framework in place for allowing technology integration
adoption to occur (Surry & Land, 2000). Surry et al. (2002) explain the RIPPLES framework as
follows:
Resources: Resources are described as monetary funds. This is notated because
implementing new technology can be costly. Planning for technology integration means
allocating the proper funding for the desired software, hardware and infrastructure.
Infrastructure: If funds are being allocated for hardware and software, proper
technological infrastructure must be in place to support new technologies being implemented.
People: Communication with the stakeholders is essential and must be considered during
the technology integration planning process. In addition, the members of the organization
should take part in the decision-making activities.
Policies: Organizations should develop policies pertaining to adapting technological
advances by faculty. If there is a policy in place addressing the need for faculty to integrate
technology into their teaching practices, teachers will be more likely to employ the latest
software and hardware.

30
Learning: The goal for implementing a technology integration plan is to enhance student
learning. Teachers and students can better communicate using the vast selection of digital tools
available.
Evaluation: Evaluation should be an ongoing process. The technology being used should
be assessed by the organization for its effectiveness. Faculty should assess whether the
technology being used is helping to do a better job teaching their students. Students should also
evaluate whether the technology being used is helping them to learn.
Support: A support system needs to be in place for all stakeholders of the organization.
All members of the community should be able to seek support for issues relating to the
technology that has been put in place.
The RIPPLES framework was not intended to be a linear model. All elements of the
model are inter-connected (Surry et al., 2002). Thus, planning for technology integration
adoption is integral for success to occur, according to Surry and Land (2000).
Travis
Travis (2008) conducted a case study applying change agency theory in a university
setting with librarians and faculty at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). Travis
wanted to explore barriers for transforming the college environment. At CSULB, it was
believed that the academic librarian’s role was not vital to classroom activities. Librarians
wanted to change that so they could be an essential part of the conversation for curriculum
reform, especially concerning information literacy or technology integration. The framework for
Travis’s case study was based on the principles of Rogers’s (2003) adoption of change model.

31
In Travis’s study (2008), the innovators were librarians seeking change. This group led
the change agent team but needed help. The early adopters were the faculty who saw the need
for change. Travis shares that the team of librarian change agents and early adopter faculty
members created a plan that correlated to the goals of the university as well as the students’
learning outcome framework. The team’s goal was to establish change by integrating
information literacy into the university curriculum. Librarians would collect and analyze data to
provide evidence to the university leadership that the plan was working and that the advantages
of the technology integration plan positively benefitted CSULB’s curriculum. Travis (2008)
used a “six functions” model as a lens to view and document these changes throughout the
process at CSULB. The six functions from Hall and Hord (2014) are based on the concernsbased adoption model, or CBAM . Elements of the six functions as originally established by
Hall and Hord (2014) are: Function one: Developing, articulating and communicating a shared
vision of intended change; Function two: Planning and allocating resources; Function three:
Investing in professional learning; Function four: Checking on progress; Function five: Giving
continuous assistance; and Function six: Creating a context of supportive change (Hall & Hord,
2014). Travis (2008) illustrates in this study the willingness of librarians to be change agents.

Jantz
Innovation in academic libraries was investigated by Jantz (2012). The introduction of
something new, such as new technology, service, product or practice, is an innovation (Jantz,
2012). In this study, diffusion of innovations (Rogers, 2003) was used as a lens to analyze
interview responses from selected academic librarians. Being that innovative culture is reflected

32
in the leadership of an organization, the author sought to find what these academic librarians
believed about innovations in their libraries and the culture for change in their environments
(Jantz, 2012). All the librarians interviewed believed that innovation was necessary for the
organization to thrive. They also believed that innovations were occurring. However, there were
some obstacles, such as a rigid job description, which inhibited change. Many librarians
reported their willingness to support innovations. They used terminology such as “collaborative”
and “participatory.” The objective for the librarians was to help the community to learn.
Additionally, the librarians’ knowledge of information technology as an innovation was high,
according to some of the librarians. However, it was believed that boundaries from one job to
another would be crossed if certain risks were taken. Some librarians felt that training was what
the job required. Job security was also a concern. Furthermore, there was an attitude in which
library administrators should offer motivation for change to occur. Finally, some librarians
reported they feared failure (Jantz, 2012).

Lewis
Web 2.0 technology adoption as a collaboration tool was investigated among two
universities in this action research study done between Midwest State University in Texas and
Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (Lewis & Donnellan, 2011). Diffusion of
innovations (Rogers, 2003) was used as an instrument for understanding the results from the
project. The objective for these students was to create an internet survey through collaboration
using Web 2.0 tools such as wikis and blogs (wikis/blogs are free online tools and are easily
accessible). The survey was designed for collecting information pertaining to political values of

33
university students. The survey instrument developed was also used to determine how university
students gain information concerning politics. Subsequently, students’ familiarity with Web 2.0
technologies does not necessarily mean that Web 2.0 tools are effective for collaboration, as
reported by the authors (Lewis & Donnellan, 2011). Instructors perceived that all students
would effectively collaborate using wikis and blogs due to their nature and due to the extensive
experience students have with Web 2.0 technologies. Results from the study showed that the
wiki was preferred over the blog. In the context of diffusion theory (Rogers, 2003), trialabilty
(try out), observability (to examine), compatibility (fitted), and complexity (difficulty) were
terms used to explain outcomes from the study pertaining to the adoption, or lack thereof, of the
Web 2.0 tools used for collaborating. There was success since students could try out
(trialability) and observe (observability) the Web 2.0 tools being used. However, there were
problems with compatibility and complexity because students reported discomfort using the
blog. The instructors, as change agents, could have modeled the uses for these tools to be more
effective. Since the instructors found wikis were preferred, they changed the nature of the
assignment by allowing only wikis in order to better serve the students (Lewis & Donnellan,
2011).

Grounded Theory
To gather data for my research, I conducted a grounded theory study. Grounded theory
was introduced by Glaser and Straus in 1967 (Glaser & Strauss, 2012). They illustrate that in a
grounded theory study, a theory can be discovered through the examination of data. Groups or

34
individuals who have a commonality are analyzed through grounded theory methods (methods
include interviews, observations, note taking, and analyzing through coding). These
investigations are efforts to produce a theory. Much of grounded theory data collected comes
from interviews. As the information is collected, development of a theme or themes emerges. A
representation of the idea or theme is explained with a visualization such as a diagram. The final
result then is the development of a new theory (Creswell, 2008).

Studies in Grounded Theory
Martin
In this study, the investigators examined the attitudes and perceptions of history
researchers and teachers on the use and adoption of digital ebooks (Martin & Quan-Haase,
2013). Grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 2012) methods were used to analyze their data. For
this investigation, the researchers developed a questionnaire to use with the historians.
Respondents answered open-ended questions to provide study data. The questionnaire was
developed using terminology based on the diffusion of innovation (Rogers, 2003). Martin and
Quan-Haase (2013) sought to understand the historians’ familiarity, attitudes and barriers
toward ebooks (Martin & Quan-Haase, 2013). History scholars were interviewed as to their
thoughts about adopting ebooks into their profession. After the interviews, Martin and QuanHaase (2013) analyzed the data to seek out themes. The data revealed that there were
discrepancies between the varying definitions of ebook. For example, some historians were not
aware that a book in Google Books was considered an ebook. Additionally, there was a range of
attitudes among the historians regarding the use of ebooks in their research. Some were early

35
adopters, others were still reluctant to accept using ebooks. Potential for ebooks emerged as a
theme based on the data collected. Convenience and accessibility were reasons cited for ebook
acceptance. However, the historians could not rely on ebooks as their only source for gathering
their resources. This idea emerged as a theme but was also noted as a barrier. Some historians
made the point that their jobs require the physical process of searching through stacks and
shelves of books in the quest for seeking information. This process was a traditional aspect of
an historian’s job. Searching through stacks and shelves also allowed for “the serendipitous
find,” that is, finding a resource that is valuable but unexpected. As a result, an implication of
the study demonstrated the importance of both print and digital resources (Martin & QuanHaase, 2013).
I found this study to be interesting in that the researchers could combine elements of
grounded theory methods as well as Rogers’s diffusion of innovations terminology for presenting
their ebook study. In other words, the study illustrated the dynamic interaction between the
method of gathering data through grounded theory study and the process of investigating
adoption of a digital tool.

Filipenko
In Filipenko’s report (2004) about information literacy development in young children,
grounded theory methods (Glaser & Strauss, 2012) were used to explore how children, between
ages 3 and 5, understood informational text. The researchers examined childrens’ oral
communications and understandings as these students expressed during read alouds and activities
revolving around informational texts (Filipenko, 2004).

36
Filipenko (2004) explained how two teachers co-taught dinosaur-themed literacy
activities. The classroom activities were centered on student play and student learning. The
children were free to play or read individually as well as in groups. During this time, the
teachers interacted and guided students with prompts and modeling. In addition, various kinds of
reading material were readily available for student access. In this context, the focal teacher,
Gina, supported students in four particular ways. First, she noticed activities that the students
were involved in and followed their lead. In this way, the Gina supported the students’ writing
or reading activity. Second, reading and writing strategies were modeled for the students. This
allowed for student skills to develop and emerge. Third, based on activities observed in the
classroom, Gina developed routines supporting reading and writing activities that would be
relevant to student learning. Fourth, Gina planned reading and writing activities relative to the
theme and to student interests. One example used in Filipenko’s (2004) report explained how
students wrote their own dinosaur books using models from informational texts. The books were
shared with the other students and then incorporated into the classroom library (Filipenko, 2004).
Using qualitative analysis methods such as coding, six categories emerged from the data
in support of a grounded theory (Bogdan & Biklen, 2006). Data coded and analyzed were from
videotape transcripts of the lessons. From these codes, the six categories to emerge were
informational text knowledge, world knowledge, the representation of meaning, connection
building, reflective talk and relational talk. The emergence of these categories supports
grounded theory in which young children can construct knowledge because of the incorporation
of information literacy instruction. This study illustrates the importance of collaboration
between teachers to support young children and their learning of non-fiction text. Filipenko

37
(2004) stresses that contributions of the school librarian as an educator of information literacy to
young children can enhance the students’ understanding of informational texts (Filipenko,
2004).

Fidishun
Using a qualitative survey to collect responses, Fidishun (2007) explored how women use
public library services. Data from the qualitative survey was analyzed through grounded theory
methods (Fidishun, 2007). In Fidishun (2007), 184 women were surveyed as to their use of the
public library. On the survey, there were questions relating to how and why these women used
the library. Questions about technology uses at the library were also included on the survey.
The researchers designed the survey with open-ended questions that allowed patrons to be free
with their answers. The open-ended answers also provided rich data for the researchers to
analyze (Fidishun, 2007). Using grounded theory methods such as coding, Fidishun (2007)
sought to find patterns using codes in order to form theories based on the patrons’ responses
(Fidishun, 2007). The study revealed that women visited the library for checking out books
(Fidishun, 2007). Other services that the studied women were interested in included using
reference materials and logging on to the internet to access online databases. Another pattern
found in the data had to do with the “library experience.” Fidishun (2007) explained “library
experiences” as those relating to how patrons interacted with staff. There were some negative
experiences; however, the positive experiences far outweighed them and included the following.
Patrons enjoyed book reviews and recommendations by the librarians. They also appreciated the
interactions the librarians had with their children. Another pattern that emerged had to do with

38
women bringing children to the library. Women are the ones who primarily bring their children
to the library (Fidishun, 2007). The final pattern reported in this study dealt with the library as a
“place.” Survey responses indicated that women enjoyed coming to the library as a place for
solitude. These women were happy to have the library as a place for relaxing and reflecting
(Fidishun, 2007). Fidishun (2007) explained how this study, qualitative in nature, should not be
generalized to the public but instead should be used by other libraries as a tool for improving
services to patrons, specifically women.
In exploring studies for this research, I did not usually come across the mention of
trustworthiness or triangulation. I found this report to be particularly refreshing because the
author included trustworthiness and triangulation in her methodology section (Fidishun, 2007).

Conclusion
Considerable research has been done regarding school libraries (Lance & Hofschire,
2012; Oberg, 2010; Scholastic, 2016) . It is my aim to add to this research and contribute by
communicating that there is power and benefit from school libraries for student learning.
Rogers’s diffusion of innovations theory is a lens through which my study will be informed.
Through qualitative methods, grounded theory procedures, and self-study, I explored how the
school librarian can act as a change agent.

METHODOLOGY
“Times and conditions change so rapidly that we must keep our aim constantly focused on the
future.” (Walt Disney)
Introduction
In my study, the role of school librarian as a change agent for integrating technology in
the junior high school setting was explored. I examined how strategies such as the integration of
digital tools in teaching and learning could be instrumental to the school librarian acting as a
change agent. This project was executed by using grounded theory and qualitative case study
methods. In an effort to understand the change process, Rogers’s diffusion of innovations also
informed my study. A self-study approach was also utilized. To better understand such
phenomena, these questions were addressed:
How is a school librarian a change agent for improving technology practices in a junior
high school?
•

What are strategies that allow the school librarian to act as an agent of change for

meaningful technology integration in the junior high school setting with teachers?
•

What are strategies that allow the school librarian to act as an agent of change for
meaningful technology integration in the junior high school setting with students?

40
Research Design
The study was conducted using the qualitative research method case study (Merriam,
1998). I believe qualitative research methods are appropriate for this project based on the
characteristics described by Bogdan and Biklen (2006). Bogdan and Biklen (2006) explain
qualitative research methods as naturalistic in nature; that is, the examinations and observations
done by the researcher are done on site in a natural setting. In this way, the researcher collects
data that is descriptive. Descriptive data can be collected in a variety of ways, including
interviews, surveys, observations and documents. In qualitative research, the process rather than
the outcome is what is important to the researcher. It was these processes that were at the heart
of my documentation. As this documentation or data collection occurred throughout the study,
being inductive was critical. Data that is collected inductively is what the theory is built upon
(Bogdan & Biklen, 2006). The concept of “meaning” is also important to the qualitative
researcher. Thus, for my research I am interested in how participants are experiencing a
situation, or what the experience “means” (Bogdan & Biklen, 2006). These concepts were
employed throughout my research study.
A case study helps to provide in-depth understanding of a situation (Creswell, 2013).
According to Merriam (1998), case studies are used to examine the processes of a single unit.
The unit can be a person, group, or society. This approach allowed for an examination of a
situation with a focus on the process rather than an outcome. Insights developed from a case
study can be beneficial for examining change (Merriam, 1998). The case study method was
appropriate for my study because this approach allowed for a deep examination of a process in

41
this case. Documentation of the change process was recorded throughout this study using
methods from Rogers’s change theory (Rogers, 2003).
Grounded theory was used as a lens for data collection and analysis. Glaser and Strauss
(2012) introduced grounded theory in 1967. With grounded theory study, a theory can be
formed through the examination of data. Data is examined through analyzing codes. Data
collection in which codes are assigned include interviews, surveys and observations. Upon
analysis of this data, new theory or concepts may be presented (Creswell, 2008). Using this
method in my research allowed me to gain insights regarding the processes of a change agent.

Research Sample
In the study, I acted as my own research sample using a self-study approach (Samaras,
2002). Teachers are expected to reflect upon their practice as a part of their professional
development (Danielson, 2013). As a result, I documented my personal reflections as well as my
interactions with teachers and students through self-study methods (Samaras, 2002). In
Samaras’s (2002) book, Self-Study for Teacher Educators, she outlines the manner in which she
herself used self-reflection writing in her teaching of preservice teachers. In addition, she
expected her students (preservice teachers) to practice self-reflection writing for improving their
own practice. They documented their preparation meetings, lessons with students, and personal
reflections with written logs. The self-reflection writing provided insight into the preservice
teachers’ instruction, planning sessions and perspectives of others (Samaras, 2002). Selfreflection writing has been likened to the grounded theory qualitative method called reflexive
memo writing (Creswell, 2008; Glaser & Strauss, 2012). Therefore, as a teacher researcher, this

42
self-reflection writing proved to be suitable for my study (Creswell, 2008; Danielson, 2013;
Glaser & Strauss, 2012; Samaras, 2002).
In my case study, I worked with middle school teachers in a junior high covering students
in grades sixth, seventh and eighth in a midwestern state approximately 30 miles west of a large
metropolitan city. There are approximately 800 students in the school. The setting of the study
primarily occurred in a language arts, special education, and technology classes. Participation
was voluntary.
Sampling Criteria for Participants
The criteria strategy I established for this study was threefold. The participating teachers:
1) must be faculty members of the school, 2) have at least one previous year of teaching
experience (preferred), and 3) must be able to demonstrate an interest in technology integration.
Each of the participating teachers were part of the school faculty. Three of the four teachers on
this research team were also tenured. Ms. E was the only non-tenured teacher in this group.
However, Ms. E had at least four years of teaching experience. During my time as a faculty
member with these colleagues, we have engaged in conversations relating to technology
integration in the classroom.

Overview of the Research Design
The following is a list showing the steps of the study.
1. Prior to data collection, a literature review was prepared to examine studies that were
completed in these areas: roles and influences of school librarians; school librarians as

43
change agents, Rogers’s diffusion of innovations, grounded theory and self-study.
2. Following the defense proposal, approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) was
requested. An outline of the research project as well as human subjects involved was
submitted to the IRB. IRB documentation is included in Appendix B.
3. Communication to teacher participants in the junior high school chosen for this research
was done through emails and personal contacts.
4. Interested teachers were interviewed on their uses of digital tools. Approval from the
teachers and the principal was sought.
5. Focus group interviews with participating teachers was conducted during fall semester
2016. One meeting was held per month for three months (September, October,
November 2016)
6. Observations of teachers working with students took place in classrooms, the library, and
in the computer lab.
7. I, as researcher, kept a journal to record field notes, memos, and general observations.
The use of interviews, focus groups and observation helped to ensure triangulation.
These tools provided validity to the study (Creswell, 2013).

Methods and Procedures
Various methods of data collection were necessary for conveying an in-depth picture of
this study (Creswell, 2008). Interviews, focus groups and observations were conducted during
this research project. Artifact collection also took place. Teacher participants were invited to
participate in the study after approval from the school principal (see Appendix B). Afterward,

44
the interested teachers were interviewed on habits and practices regarding the integration of
digital tools and practices. To corroborate interview data, focus groups met for in-depth
discussion relating to questions, ideas and issues involving the study. Data from focus groups
also helped to achieve triangulation (Creswell, 2008). Observation was done in classrooms, the
school library, and the computer lab. Throughout the observations, descriptive field notes were
taken for recording objective descriptions of the settings and participants (Bogdan & Biklen,
2006). Reflective field notes were also recorded. Reflective field notes allowed for recording
assumptions, attitudes and feelings. According to Bogdan and Biklen (2006), this kind of note
taking, or journaling, is more subjective. Collecting artifacts such as collaborative lesson plans
and student work also occurred throughout the study (Bogdan & Biklen, 2006). This study took
place over the course of the first semester (August through December) during 2016. The first
semester was chosen due to limited standardized testing for students. During the second
semester, students are involved in taking both local and state assessments. These methods were
applied to my research study regarding technology integration practices in the junior high school.

Interviews
Interviews helped to provide rich data. I interviewed each teacher participant twice
during the 2016 fall semester. Data from interviews also corroborated other material collected in
focus groups and in observations (Creswell, 2008). To see the comparison of responses between
the start and end of the semester, the interviews were conducted in September and December.
Teacher participants were interviewed as to the information they already knew about using
digital tools in the classroom. These teacher participants were also asked about what new

45
information they wished to learn concerning digital tools. At the end of the semester,
participants discussed what was learned regarding the integration of digital tools into their
curriculum.

Focus Groups
The purpose of the focus group was to allow participants an opportunity to have honest
discussion relating to the study (Bogdan & Biklen, 2006). Included in the focus group meetings
for my study were a topic, discussion, and structure (Bogdan & Biklen, 2006; Creswell, 2008).
In this project, the teachers would meet in 40-minute sessions once a month over three months.
In September, participants were asked to share goals relating to the integration of digital tools.
Over the next two months, participants discussed what went well, what was learned, and what
was a struggle. At the end of the semester, technology integration goals were discussed at the
final focus group meeting.

Observations and Notes
An aspect of this study included collaboration with teachers to implement activities that
integrate digital tools. I observed these activities and recorded them using field notes. My
records included the use of descriptive and reflective field notes. The purpose for recording
descriptive field notes was simply to describe what was being observed, the activity in which the
participants were involved. Included in these descriptions of participants were the setting and
what was said (Bogdan & Biklen, 2006). Reflective field notes were also used to record
observations and included a summary of the activity being observed. Assumptions, feelings,

46
conflicts and dilemmas were added to these notes. It is important to see here reflective field
notes can be subjective in manner (Bogdan & Biklen, 2006). As a teacher, reflecting is a
significant part of pedagogical practice and keeping reflective field notes allows for teachers to
gain insights for learning and for improving our practice (Danielson, 2013). My research study
was also a reflection of my practice, so recording and keeping notes allowed me to expand
awareness to my field of study.

Documents
Documents, or artifacts considered significant to this study, were collected. Items
collected were collaborative teacher plans. Permission from the owners of these items was
granted in advance (Bogdan & Biklen, 2006).
Coding
After the data are collected, coding and analysis occurred for interpretation (Creswell,
2013). In coding, the data were sorted to identify recurring themes. According to Creswell
(2013), this is done through various methods, which include but are not limited to taking notes,
sorting and identifying categories. Bogdan and Biklen (2006) explain coding as a way to
categorize words and phrases from field notes, memos and other data taken over the course of
the study. As certain words and phrases stand out and repeat, these ideas are considered “coding
categories.” The qualitative data analysis (QDA) software NVivo (QSR, 2017) was used to code
my data. This software allows for uses to analyze non-numerical data, also called unstructured
data. My data was non-numerical, so this program was beneficial to my coding efforts (QSR,
2017).

47
The purpose of this grounded theory study project was to generate a theory from the
evidence collected during this research. Consequently, there were three cycles of coding of the
data collected: initial or open coding, axial coding, and theoretical coding (Glaser & Strauss,
2012; Saldana, 2012). Details regarding coding procedures will be outlined in the findings
chapter.

Triangulation
Triangulation is a validity procedure in which researchers corroborate their data by using
a variety of collection methods (Creswell & Miller, 2000). It is the process in which there is an
effort to report accurate and credible information (Creswell, 2008). Interviews, observations,
questionnaires and other instruments of methodology are used as a form of validation. This
allows for various perceptions of the data to be conveyed (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Since
objective reality does not exist, according to Denzin and Lincoln (2011), the researcher must use
a variety of data collection methods, or triangulation, in order to better understand the
phenomenon of the study. For triangulating, Bogdan and Biklen (2006) suggest that the
qualitative researcher simply report and describe the methodological activities that will occur
during the course of the study.
My triangulation activities included journaling, interviews, and focus group meetings
(Creswell, 2013). Since this was a self-study project, I frequently reflected and journaled my
observations and activities throughout the time of this study. This kind of activity is familiar to
teachers since it is a part of our ongoing evaluation process (Danielson, 2013). In addition,

48
interviews focusing on the integration of digital tools was conducted with the participating
teachers as were focus groups.

Data Analysis
The data collected was analyzed using grounded theory methodology. After initial and
axial coding, the third stage called theoretical or selective coding brought all data together for the
formulation of a theory (Creswell, 2013). (See detailed description below.)
Initial coding, also called open coding, is an open-ended method for coding data
(Saldana, 2012). This is the first phase of coding activities in which all data are examined.
Throughout this time, the researcher notates codes, categories and themes from data such as field
notes, observations and interviews (Creswell, 2013). Analytic memos were developed during the
process. An analytic memo, as opposed to field notes, is a reflection written relating to the data
being analyzed. Analytic memos can also be coded during the research process (Saldana, 2012).
During the axial coding phase (second stage), one of the categories identified in the initial
coding phase is selected for further analysis. This category is called the core category, or core
phenomenon. The core phenomenon is examined as related to the categories identified during
the initial coding (Creswell, 2013). This analysis is considered an axial coding paradigm,
according to Creswell (2013). Researchers create flow charts and other graphic representations
to allow for a visual explanation of the theory being presented (Saldana, 2012).
The final stage is called selective or theoretical coding (Saldana, 2012). It is this stage
where data are examined and synthesized for the formation of a theory. Again, there is the use of
visual representation for explaining the process of theory formation (Saldana, 2012). See

49
Appendix C for a more detailed table of coding. The following is an illustration of focus groups,
interviews, and observation coding (see Table 1).
Table 1
Coding from Interviews, Observations and Focus Group Examples for Ms. B

Establishing Trustworthiness of Qualitative Data
Triangulation activities included in this research study help to ensure that trustworthiness
was established (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Member checking, peer debriefing and thick
description were incorporated to make certain that trustworthiness was present in this study.
Member checking and peer debriefing involved collaboration between everyone involved in the
project. A member-checking strategy I used was focus groups. Focus group meetings allowed
an opportunity for participants to corroborate experiences (Creswell & Miller, 2000). In
addition, thick description I used also will allow for the reader of the study to feel the
experiences felt within the course of the project (Creswell & Miller, 2000).

50
Role of the Researcher
During this study, my role as a researcher was as an active member of the team. I am the
school librarian at this junior high. My participation occurred in all aspects of this study. I
recruited teachers to be included in this research study. I planned and ran the focus group
meetings, I interviewed the teachers, and I did the classroom observations. I did these activities
as the researcher and as the school librarian.

Self-Study
As educators, we are expected to be reflective in our profession (Danielson, 2013). Part
of my job as a practitioner is to reflect and collaborate to better my skill as an educator. One of
my goals in this project is to document my collaborations and observations through personal
reflection, or through a self-study approach (Samaras, 2002).
Self-reflection writing was compared to reflexive memo writing in grounded theory
qualitative methodology (Creswell, 2008). Reflexive memo writing is what the researcher does
for documenting observations and ideas to generate further inquiries relating to the study
(Creswell, 2008).
According to Moen (2008), teachers believe that students should take time to reflect on
their learning. He makes the point that teachers should be reflecting as well. Policymakers,
school administrators, parents, students, and others in the field of education share their thoughts,
opinions and reflections on issues in education. However, it is the teachers’ reflections on
matters that is not often heard (Moen, 2008). Self-narrative in self-study can be a valuable tool
for the teacher as researcher (Samaras, 2002). Since educators experience events with students

51
directly, the teacher-researcher can use self-narrative methods to generate, gain and share new
insights (Kennedy-Lewis, 2012).

Participants
There were four middle school teachers who participated in my study. All four teachers
have been employed by the district for three or more years. Two teachers are part of the elective
teacher team: Ms. L covers graphic arts, 3-D art, and drama; Mr. S covers technology and web
applications and Advancement Via Individual Determination, or AVID. The other two
participants are English language arts instructors: Ms. E is on the seventh-grade team, and Ms. B
is on the special education team.
Ms. L
Ms. L is one of the elective teachers. Her job is varied in that she teachers sixth, seventh
and eighth graders three different courses. 3-D art is a traditional curriculum which includes
drawing, painting and sculpture; 2-D art, or graphic art and design, is a computer-based course.

With the graphics design course, Ms. L teaches students Photoshop and Adobe applications. Ms.
L also teaches drama. Her focus and partnership with the school librarian, using digital tools for
technology integration, were primarily done in the drama class. Drama students used art skills to
create sets, including puppets, to use in their drama activities. They also wrote scripts and
blocked the action in their plays. Ms. L’s primary goal for these students was to help them video
their drama activities, including puppet shows, news programs, and commercials.

52
Mr. S
Mr. S teaches technology and web applications. In these classes, Mr. S covers software
such as Photoshop, Adobe Creative Suite, and Dreamweaver. Mr. S is also the AVID (AVID,
2017) elective instructor. This is a program brought to school districts to help students become
college ready. The program specifically targets students who are underrepresented in colleges
and universities (AVID, 2017). The AVID program is a prescribed curriculum which covers
items such as note taking and study skills. These skills are then incorporated into the students’
core subject-matter courses. What Mr. S discovered while planning and reviewing the AVID
curriculum was that it lacked technology integration. In addition to the library media specialist
duties that I hold, I am also one of the AVID tutors. AVID tutors help students in a Socratic-like
seminar to reach answers to questions posed by the students when they are doing their class
work. Mr. S and I worked together to bring technology to the AVID program by creating a
WebQuest (Dodge, 2017) on website evaluation skills.

Ms. E
Ms. E is a seventh-grade English language arts instructor. Ms. E is relatively new to the
school district. She has been with the district less than five years. She is an energetic,
enthusiastic teacher. In both my formal and informal observations of Ms. E, she engages her
students during her teaching of language arts. Every time I walked into Ms. E’s classroom,
students would be actively reading, writing or helping other students. Ms. E’s goal was to use
digital tools to help motivate students to be better writers. With the school district planning to
use Google Apps for Education (now GSuite) (Google, 2017), Ms. E was anxious to get started.

53
The plan for GAFE to be rolled out to the district was delayed, so Ms. E wanted to attempt to use
a digital tool that allowed for student collaboration with her and with the other students. The tool
Ms. E found to achieve these objectives was Edmodo. Ms. E decided to incorporate Edmodo
(Edmodo, 2017) into her language arts lessons.
Ms. B
Ms. B has been in the district less than ten years. She has admitted to being reluctant to
integrating technology in her lessons. She is one of the special education instructors in language
arts. In addition, Ms. B also supports various content-area classes, such as science. In her direct
language arts instruction, Ms. B sees students in two-block periods, which is approximately 80
minutes per day. The language arts instruction follows the regular education language arts
curriculum, with supports in place to accommodate each student’s Individualized Education
Program, or IEP. Ms. B’s interest in joining this research group was for inspiration to help
motivate her students by using digital tools in her teaching. In her words, she was ready to take
“baby steps.”

Procedures
Teacher Recruitment
At the start of the academic school year, I sought permission from the school principal for
my study. We discussed my research as being a record and reflection of what the school library
media specialist does within the parameters of the job. Since the study did not require too much
out of the ordinary insofar as my teaching responsibilities, he was willing to allow it to take
place. After receiving permission from the principal, I began my search for teacher participants.

54
Since I am an employee at the school, I personally approached some teachers with whom I
already had a good working relationship. The teachers I approached were ones who had
previously showed interest in integrating digital tools. I also sought teachers I believed were
honest about facing struggles dealing with technology integration. Four teachers came forward.
They were a special education language arts teacher, a regular education language arts teacher, a
technology specialist, and the art/drama/graphic arts teacher.

Focus Group Interview
Our school district utilizes the Danielson model for teacher evaluations (Danielson,
2013). In planning instruction, teachers refer to the four domains in the Danielson model. They
are: 1. Planning and Preparation, 2. Classroom Environment, 3. Instruction and 4. Professional
Responsibilities (Danielson, 2013). Although my purpose for this study did not deal with
evaluations, I did want to incorporate typical tools used by teachers. In the Danielson
framework, under Professional Responsibilities, teachers in the district are to participate in
professional learning communities (PLC). I took the opportunity to create a PLC community as
the focus group for this study. This focus group met once a month over three months during the
fall semester. The driving motivation for the focus group topics dealt with my research
questions. A questioning framework was based on the KWL model: What do you KNOW?
What do you WANT to learn? What have you LEARNED? (Ogle, 1986); (see Appendix A for
focus group topics and questions).

55
Observations
During the focus group meetings, planning for classroom observations occurred. During
observations, my roles were as the researcher, observer, and as a participant. If the teacher
participant needed me to do something other than observe, then this would be part of the
observation plan. Some of the classroom observations included me as one of the teachers either
teaching an iPad app, teaching website evaluation to students, or another type of participation.

Individual Interviews
Interviews were also planned during the focus group meetings. The focus group
interview meetings evolved into a group collaboration session for planning instructional lessons
relating to technology integration. In addition, the interviews evolved into a one-on-one
planning session for teaching technology integration lessons. The teacher participants
interviewed were a special education language arts teacher, a regular education language arts
teacher, a technology specialist, and the art/drama/graphic arts teacher.

Researcher Journal
Throughout the study, I kept a researcher’s journal. The journal was utilized for
recording events and ideas. In addition, the entries allowed for looking back to reflect on not
only the research being conducted but also on my practice as an educator and as a library media
specialist.

56
Conclusion
This study explored the role of the school librarian as a change agent for integrating
technology. Integrating digital tools during instruction was examined by using methods such as
interviews, focus groups, and observations. Rogers’s diffusion of innovations theory informed
my study as data were analyzed for understanding the change process. Grounded theory
methods as well as self-study approaches were also applied.

CHAPTER 4

FINDINGS
“Change is the end result of all learning.” (Leo Buscaglia)

This chapter examines the outcome from the qualitative data analysis collected during my
study. The data were also analyzed through the lens of grounded theory. This case study was
completed in a junior high (grades six, seven and eight) located in the southwest suburbs of
Chicago, Illinois. The study explores how the library media specialist acts to support teachers
and students with strategies when they integrate technology using digital tools. Four teachers
were involved in this case study. These teachers participated in focus group and interviews and
were also observed in their classroom environments. As a result, several themes in the following
topics emerged: Learning, Resources, Cross-curricular, Attitudes, Collaboration, Assessment,
and Time Management. These themes will be explored later in this chapter.

Background
This study was completed at a junior high school in a southwest suburb of Chicago,
Illinois. There are approximately 900 students, 100 teachers, and three administrators within the
school community. This junior high is a “title school,” which is defined by the U.S. Department
of Education as a school with a high number of children from low-income families. Therefore,

58
title schools are provided with additional financial assistance (U.S Dept. of Ed., 2017). Four
teachers in various subject areas were recruited to participate in this case study. The study was
an exploration of the impact of the library media specialist and how he or she supports the
integration of technology and the use of digital tools for student learning.

Environment
The study occurred in a junior high setting in a school built in 2006. This is a two-story
building consisting of classrooms and offices, along with a gymnasium, cafeteria (also used as an
auditorium), library, six computer labs, an industrial arts room, and a family and consumer
sciences lab. All classrooms are equipped with an LCD projector and at least one desktop
computer.
The Illinois Report Card (ISBE, 2017a) provides demographic information as follows:
51.6% of students are White, 10.2% Black, 27.5% Hispanic and 3.5% Asian. It is reported that
enrollment is approximately 900 students. The school has been identified as “Title I,” meaning
that federal grants would be available due to a high percentage of families that are considered
low-income. The percentage of low-income families at this school is 32 % (ISBE, 2017a; U.S.
Dept. of Ed., 2017).
Available technologies include four computer labs which are connected to the school
library. Two additional computer labs are also available, but these are primarily in use for
elective courses such as graphic arts and technology application classes. Mobile lab carts are
also available for teacher use. Two iPad carts and one Chromebook cart can be checked out to
classrooms.

59
Although a technology department exists within the school district, there is very little
professional development for district teachers in technology integration provided by this unit.
Instead, the school district plans staff development through the Professional Development
Department. This department primarily plans teacher training in the content areas such as math
and language arts. Google Apps For Education (GAFE) have been recently promoted and
approved for use in the district, and as a result, there has been some staff development for
integrating GAFE (Google, 2017). The district allows for “in-school” training. Thus, if a
teacher has an idea for a staff development session, the teacher proposes the idea, gets it
approved and then offers the session to local building teachers for individual training. It is
through this mode, that I, the school librarian, can offer technology integration staff
development.

Themes
Analysis of data from the focus group meetings (PLC), observations, interviews, and
journaling my own experiences as the school librarian and researcher revealed the following
seven themes: Learning, Resources, Cross-curricular, Attitudes, Collaboration, Assessment and
Time Management (Figure 3). This section will detail the findings in each theme. Each theme
will be discussed further in Chapter Five.

Themes in Integrating Digital Tools
Figure 3. Emerging themes.
Learning
Learning surfaced as the strongest theme from the data. Student learning, student
motivation and teacher learning were the main highlights of this theme. Student learning with
digital tools was observed in many ways. Students were cooperative and helped each other.
They were also engaged and enthusiastic. The following example illustrates student learning and
motivation. I introduced a class to ComicLife (Plasq, 2017) in collaboration with one of the
teacher participants. The objective for the students was to show elements of a myth by creating
an original myth. Students were to storyboard to create their stories and then either create
original digital images or search for images on the internet. The culminating product would be a
myth created by students with digital imagery presented in ComicLife. Students helped each
other navigate through ComicLife and image searching. They also gave each other feedback on
the comics being created. During this activity, students not only gained confidence to help each
other, but they also helped their teacher to better understand ComicLife. Teacher learning
surfaced within this theme as well. In this example, the teacher was not familiar with this
application. She was learning right along with her students.

61
Also during my study, I found these statements about learning from each participant to be
essential:
Ms. L noted: “Students learn quickly. If one student has knowledge or experience, they
will quickly teach the group.”
Mr. S also stated: “Tech integration can motivate learning.”
Ms. E reflected: “Students learned time management skills, plus the ability to problem
solve as issues arise.”
Ms. B reported: “Students were helping each other and worked on troubleshooting
problems together.”
These statements illustrate how these teachers felt about student learning
This summary about the Learning theme demonstrates how student learning, student motivation,
and teacher learning have emerged from the data of this research.

Resources
The concept of resourcesalso emerged as a theme. The main focuses on this theme dealt
with learning various technologies (online resources, desktop applications and mobile
applications) and with limitations to resources (hardware availability and software cost for
applications if not a free Web 2.0 app). All participants were willing to learn new applications
to incorporate into lessons. Many of those applications were readily available. These teachers
were familiar with Office applications available as needed for students and staff. Unfamiliar
applications could also be accessed. For example, the Language Arts Department was interested
in seeking out a comic maker application. Many free Web 2.0 versions were explored; however,
premium fees would at times pose an issue. During our exploration we discovered that our

62
school district had a license for ComicLife (Plasq, 2017), so we investigated this program. Other
unfamiliar programs that were explored were Kahoot, Edmodo, Sketch, DoInk, iMovie and
Springboard Digital. Although the teacher participants had inexperience with these programs,
they were nevertheless willing to learn.
Another aspect of this theme related to using hardware resources. Many resources exist
in the school, but use is limited. The school has four, 32-computer labs attached to the library.
These labs can be scheduled by teachers as needed. However, the issue that frequently arose was
that the labs were booked and unable to be used when needed. iPad carts were also available for
check out. The school owns two carts: one cart with 15 devices and another cart with 30 devices.
Due to the popularity of these digital resources, there was also limited availability of these
devices (see Table 2).

Cross-curricular
Each of the participants conveyed the importance of using technology across the
curriculum. Ms. B and Ms. E both teach the language arts curriculum using the Springboard
textbook from the College Board (2005). The textbook includes ideas for multimedia, website
evaluation, creating online comics and moviemaking, just to name some examples
(CollegeBoard, 2005). For example, Ms. E teaches seventh-grade language arts. The class was
working on a myth unit. One of the activities from the Springboard textbook was to have
students create an original myth. The myth was to include an original illustration (CollegeBoard,
2005). This activity was inherently cross-curricular based on the instructions from the text, such
as reading, writing, drawing and history. Ms. E wanted to give students an opportunity to use

64
digital tools during this activity. Together, we decided to introduce the iPad app, Sketch
(Tayasui, 2017). As such, the teacher asked me to model its use. Students would therefore have
the choice to create artwork using traditional tools such as paper and pens or using digital tools,
such as the Sketch app. This iPad application is a general drawing program in which the user
creates artwork using digital pens, markers and paints. Once the artwork is completed, students
could export their work digitally. Thus, this would allow students to electronically use and share
their work (Tayasui, 2017). Once the drawing is in a digital format, students are able to use
their work in a word processing or slide sharing program. In addition, students can share their
drawings in email or social network with Sketch.
Ms. L and Mr. S both teach technology courses. Since these are elective courses, the goal
is to integrate curricular concepts within the context of their elective classes. Both technology
instructors were interested in teaching students something new through using digital tools, as
well as integrating curricular ideas that related to student core coursework. Ms. L, in addition to
teaching graphic arts technology courses, also teaches art and drama. She expressed an interest
in having her students create digital portfolios. Given this, I introduced her to Animoto. This
tool had the elements she was looking for, so she required her students to create Animoto
accounts at Animoto.com (Animoto, 2017). This online tool allows students to gather photos
and videos for presenting in an engaging and musical slideshow (Animoto, 2017). Ms. L found
Animoto “powerful and easy.” Mr. S primarily teaches technology applications and web design
to students. However, he has one elective class called AVID. This class is a nationwide
program promoting college and career awareness to young people (AVID, 2017). In becoming
familiar with the AVID curriculum, Mr. S discovered a weakness in the program. Although the

65
program promotes organization and study skills, it lacks technology integration ideas (AVID,
2017). Mr. S also found that many of the AVID students needed support with basic technology
skills such as online searching. With this in mind, he and I worked together to build a
WebQuest (Dodge, 2017) to strengthen student skills in online searching and website evaluation.
Attitudes
Attitudes about integrating digital tools were varied among the teacher participants.
Although there was some resistance reported by certain participants, all of them related positive
feelings about their technology integration activities. Some of the resistance, as explained by
Ms. B, was that she “would not take on new tech,” and she felt “inclined to be safe.” However,
she expressed that she feels she is off to a good start with “support from colleagues and through
participating in the focus group.” Ms. E’s concerns pertained to the use of the Google
applications with students. Having started her work with Edmodo (Edmodo, 2017) during the
fall semester, her hope was that the skills learned would transfer once students were issued
Google accounts in the spring (Google, 2017).
All four teacher participants expressed eagerness during the planning stages for the
technology integration activities. The teachers anticipated student excitement as well.
Collaboration
Each participant in the study expressed the value in collaborating with colleagues for
gaining technology integration ideas. Ms. B stated that she approached other colleagues to learn
how to use Kahoot, the online tool which is a game-like question-and-answer activity (Kahoot!,
2017). Ms. B discovered that in seeking help with the Kahoot game, there was a domino effect
of learning from one teacher to another and then from her to our focus group participants.

66
Through an observation of Ms. B’s class during a Kahoot game, students were seen to be
actively engaged in competing and answering questions (Kahoot!, 2017). With Kahoot, Ms. B
created questions pertaining to the book, The Outsiders, by S.E Hinton (Hinton, 1995). Students
enjoyed calling out answers and high-fiving their peers as the correct answers were displayed on
the screen. In my interview with Ms. B, she stated that “it moved” her to see her students
enjoying learning with this online game, so she was encouraged as a result to find more digital
tools to integrate for the sake of student learning and motivation. From this “domino effect” of
learning, Ms. L found a use for the Kahoot game (Kahoot!, 2017) with her students as well. Ms.
L decided to try to use Kahoot as an assessment for her Performance Evaluation Reform Act of
Illinois, or PERA (ISBE, 2017c) lessons. PERA is a state mandate requiring that student growth
is documented during the teacher evaluation cycle (ISBE, 2017c). Ms. L said she found success
using Kahoot to reach her students’ PERA goals. She created a pretest Kahoot at the start of her
unit and then ended the unit with a posttest Kahoot (Kahoot!, 2017).
Ms. E’s focus on collaboration was with her students. Her goal was to gain ideas on
effectively collaborating with them. During the year of my research, Google Apps for
Education, or GSuite (Google, 2017), was intended to be introduced to teachers by the school
district’s Professional Development Department. However, that introduction was occurring
later in the year, during the spring semester (my research was done in the fall of that school
year). One motivation for Ms. E was to better evaluate learning by providing more immediate
feedback to students. Ms. E, as a language arts instructor, sees scores of student essays.
Typically, she would require students to print their papers, then she would give feedback and
grade. By adding a digital tool, Ms. E could give students feedback on their work in a timelier

67
manner. The digital tool she selected was the online program Edmodo, from Edmodo.com
(Edmodo, 2017). Edmodo is a collaboration platform that allows students and teachers to
collaborate in an online setting. The teacher can post classroom assignments for students to
complete, turn in, and have graded. Edmodo met Ms. E’s needs with students and collaboration
of student work up until the time that Google accounts for students could be accessed.
Collaboration occurred between myself and Mr. S in reference to his AVID course
(AVID, 2017). Twenty seventh-grade students were involved in the class. Although Mr. S
teaches web design and technology applications, Mr. S’s interest for collaborating with me was
to introduce basic skills in technology and information literacy such as researching and online
searching to these students. Together, we worked on a website evaluation unit. In this unit,
students were introduced to a web evaluation checklist. The checklist helped students
differentiate between reliable and unreliable websites. The objective was for students to be able
to choose proper sources to use when researching class projects. The unit was presented in a
WebQuest (Dodge, 2017) format. The WebQuest is an online tool which allows teachers to
create a series of tasks that lead students to complete a goal. The goal could be the completion of
an assignment or answers to questions relating to a unit of study (Dodge, 2017). I created this
WebQuest so the unit could be preserved online to use again in the future. These web evaluation
lessons spanned over six weeks. I met with the class for one 42-minute period a week. The
expectation or goal for these students was to use the website evaluation information not only
during AVID activities but also in other classes. Since AVID activities and technology
integration work across all subjects, the unit we worked on was meant to be cross-curricular.

68
Assessment
It was important for each teacher participant to assess student work. When evaluating the
digital tool being considered, each of the teachers reflected on how he or she would assess the
project being completed by the student. They asked questions such as: Did the students’
products reflect what was being taught? Did the students understand how to use the tool? Was
the digital tool appropriate for the assigned work?
Time Management
Two of the teachers mentioned time as a factor when learning about incorporating digital
tools during instruction. Although this theme did not emerge as one of the stronger themes, I
feel it is essential to mention since the time element has been discussed as a barrier in other
research in various articles of the literature review. That time was so infrequently mentioned by
this group of teachers seems to align to Rogers’s (2003) element of time as described in his
diffusion of innovations theory (Rogers, 2003).
The Innovators group is at the start of Rogers’s (2003) adopters category continuum,
followed by Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority and then Laggards. These categories
comprise the population of a group considering a new adoption. Innovators are the individuals
who need the least amount of time when considering an adoption of an idea, with Laggards
needing the most amount of time (Rogers, 2003). I did not believe that any of the research team
members showed characteristics of the Late Majority group or Laggards; one of those
characteristics was that of needing time for the adoption (Rogers, 2003).

69
LMS as Change Agent (KWL)
Focus group discussion questions and interview questions were posed in a KWL format:
What do you KNOW? What do you WANT to learn? What have you LEARNED? This format
of questioning is very common for teachers to pose to students for recording and assessing what
was learned by students. For this reason, I chose to use this familiar format to guide the
discussions and interviews (Ogle, 1986). Through the data analysis, statements were coded
based on the KWL model (Figure 4). Using the KWL model during the focus group PLC
meetings also served as a strategy for helping the teacher participants plan and outline their use
of digital tools.
The following seven themes emerged because of this study: Learning, Resources, Crosscurricular, Attitudes, Collaboration, Assessment, and Time Management. Focus group meetings
(PLC), observations, interviews, and journaling as the school librarian and researcher were
conducted in this research (see Table 3).

Conclusion
This case study was an exploration as to how the library media specialist supports
teachers and students concerning the introduction of strategies to integrate digital tools into the
curriculum. The case study investigated four teachers and their activities with some of their
students. The teachers and school librarian/researcher (myself), participated in focus groups,
interviews and observations. From the data, emerging theme topics included the following:
Cross-curricular, Collaboration, Attitudes, Resources, Time Management, Assessment, and
Learning.

DISCUSSION
“Let us remember: One book, one pen, one child and one teacher can change the world.” (Malala
Yousafzai)
Summary
This investigation focused on the junior high school librarian acting as a change agent
while integrating digital tools into the educational setting. A case study (Merriam, 1998) was
applied using qualitative inquiry methods (Bogdan & Biklen, 2006). To inform my study, data
was examined using Rogers’s (2003) diffusion of innovations as a lens for comprehending the
change process. Additionally, a self-study method was also applied (Samaras, 2002). As the
school librarian, it was natural for me to be a part of this study because many of the activities
reflected the daily experiences in which the teacher participants and I were familiar. A
grounded theory approach was also utilized. In using grounded theory methods, a researcher
analyzes and codes data for the formation of a new concept or theory. This new idea, or theory,
is frequently symbolized with a visual representation (Glaser & Strauss, 2012). To better
comprehend these concepts, the following research questions were addressed:

72
How is a school librarian a change agent for improving technology practices in a junior
high school?
•

What are strategies that allow the junior high school librarian to act as an agent of
change for meaningful technology integration, given his/her work with teachers?

•

What are strategies that allow the junior high school librarian to act as an agent of
change for meaningful technology integration, given his/her work with students?

With these research questions in mind, the technology integration activities of four junior
high school teachers, their students, and myself were investigated. Focus group interviews,
individual interviews, and observations were utilized during this study. The themes that surfaced
from the data were: Learning, Resources, Cross-curricular, Attitudes, Collaboration,
Assessment, and Time Management. In this chapter, connections between themes and
relationships to theoretical constructs and literature cited are discussed. Themes relating to the
research questions are also covered.

Part One and Part Two Discussion Preview
The following discussion is broken down into two parts. In part one, I discuss the themes
and categories that emerged from the data in relation to Rogers’s diffusion theory (Rogers,
2003). In part two, I discuss how my theory evolved by using grounded theory methods (Glaser
& Strauss, 2012).

73
Discussion: Part One: Overview of the Emerging Themes/Categories
Review of Rogers’s Diffusion of Innovations
The five-step Innovation-Decision method as described by Rogers is what an individual
experiences during decision making. The process is summarized as follows: 1) Knowledge, 2)
Persuasion, 3) Decision, 4) Implementation, 5) Confirmation. Knowledge is the revelation of a
concept or innovation a person has discovered. The element of Persuasion is when the person
accepts the idea as either a positive or negative innovation. Decision is when an individual
agrees to adopt or reject the concept. If the individual agrees to adopt the innovation, Rogers
names this Implementation. Finally, Confirmation is expressed as the assessment of the
implementation by the individual. It is this process of change that informed my study (Rogers,
2003); (See Figure 1).
In addition, the documentation of the participant responses and the change process that
occurred over the course of this research was recorded using the KWL model: What do you
KNOW? What do you WANT to learn? What have you LEARNED? (Ogle, 1986). Through
my own experiences teaching students, I found that the KWL model is a valuable tool for
recording student learning, and therefore I also felt it applicable to recording teacher participant
learning. In the case of the teacher research team, the change was the implementation and use of
a new digital tool.
Rogers’s (2003) explanation of the population or audience contemplating an adoption (a
technology adoption in the case of my study) also informed my research. When a population is
considering an innovation to adopt, Rogers (2003) categorizes the population into subgroups.
These subgroups represent the ideal example. They are: 1) Innovators, 2) Early Adopters, 3)

74
Early Majority, 4) Late Majority, and 5) Laggards. Innovators are the developers of the idea
being considered for adoption. They are the smallest subgroup in the organization; 2.5 % of a
particular population deciding upon an adoption, according to Rogers (2003), are Innovators.
These idealist individuals have cutting-edge ideas. Because this is a small group of individuals,
their effect over the larger group regarding adoption may not be significant. Nonetheless, to
collaborate, these Innovator individuals will seek out other peers, whom Rogers (2003) calls
Early Adopters. The Early Adopters consist of about 13.5% of the organization within the social
group (Rogers, 2003) . Innovators rely on Early Adopters to communicate the adoption message
across to the rest of the organization. If the Early Adopters accept the adoption, these individuals
will eagerly communicate the message to the greater group (Rogers, 2003). The Early Majority
are the pragmatic individuals in the organization. This subgroup consists of 34% of the adopters
(Rogers, 2003). This sub-group will accept an adoption after it has been shown that the methods
have been proven. This sub-group of individuals does not typically lead during an adoption
process; however, they will accept the adoption if it proves to be beneficial. According to
Rogers (2003), the Late Majority subgroup is described as skeptics. The Late Majority is made
up of about 34% of the adopting population. This conservative subgroup of individuals will
begin to consider the adoption of the innovation only after the rest of the organization has done
so (Rogers, 2003). The Laggards are the final sub-group, according to Rogers (2003). The
Laggards are traditional individuals. This subgroup population will accept the adoption only
when it becomes mandatory (Rogers, 2003); (see Figure 2).
Based on the teacher participant responses and my observations, my premise is that the
studied teachers fall into three of Rogers’s (2003) adoption personality descriptions: Innovators,

75
Early Adopters, and Early Majority. Rogers (2003) points out that these category descriptions
are for ideal conditions within an adoption process. Individuals may move in and out of various
categories, depending on the situation. In this chapter, I examine Rogers’s (2003) personality
category descriptors with the four teacher participants. Participant responses are summarized in
relation to the emerging themes in Chapter 4 (see Table 3).

Learning
In School Libraries 3.0 (Butler, 2015), Butler alludes to instruction taking various forms.
Since instruction and learning are closely related, I found Butler’s statement regarding
instruction to be true about learning as well. In addition, Butler makes reference to the idea that
school librarians have many roles, as well as many titles (Butler, 2015). One of the many roles
of the school librarian is to help students learn (Butler, 2015; Hopkins, 1998). Learning emerged
as the most referenced theme during this study. Consequently, Branch and Oberg (2001) states
that school librarians need to lead as role models for the sake of student learning.
As stated in Chapter 4, I found these responses about learning from each participant to be
significant. Each statement refers to learning through technology integration:
Ms. L noted: “Students learn quickly. If one student has knowledge or experience, they
will quickly teach the group.”
Mr. S also stated: “Tech integration can motivate learning.”
Ms. E reflected: “Students learned time management skills, plus the ability to problem
solve as issues arise.”
Ms. B reported: “Students were helping each other and worked on troubleshooting
problems together.”

76
These teacher responses serve as examples as to how the teachers felt about student
learning; that is, they are supportive of student-centered education. As such, these statements
support constructivist research studies as cited in the literature review, being that studentcentered learning is an integral component of constructivism (Ertmer et al., 2012) . The
constructivist views as shown by the teachers’ statements can also serve as a gauge of their level
of technology integration pedagogical practices (Ertmer et al., 2012) .

Resources
According to Hopkins (1998), the school librarian should collaborate to find resources
and materials beyond the walls of the library. In my research, resources, as expressed by the
participants, emerged as the second strongest theme. Per this study, since funds have been
allocated for purchasing technological resources, school librarians should facilitate using such
resources (Hanson-Baldauf & Hassell, 2009). In Chapter 4 I reported that collaborating with
teacher participants during my study allowed for planning to use the available digital tools.
Therefore, each teacher participant in my research group was willing to incorporate both new
and older technology into his/her lessons. Various digital tools used by the teacher participants
included such software as ComicLife, Kahoot!, Edmodo, Sketch, DoInk, iMovie, Springboard
Digital and WebQuests. If a teacher participant was not familiar with these programs, s/he was
willing to try if the teacher felt the program was lesson appropriate. This attitude shown by the
teachers on my research team is consistent with Rogers’s (2003) assessment of the Early Adopter
personality. Early Adopters are risk takers and willing to try something new. In the case of the
teacher research team, a new digital tool was being considered for integration into lessons.

77
Hardware resources were also accessed by the group. If there was concern or
apprehension with integration it usually dealt with hardware availability. In Johnston’s study
(2012), librarians were frequently consumed with troubleshooting older equipment, causing a
limit to available resources, although in my case as a school librarian it is more likely that I am
troubleshooting, perhaps not fixing older equipment, but developing creative ways the equipment
can be shared. This is, hence, an issue dealing with resource access. Equipment that can be lent
out in the school of my study are 45 iPad devices, 28 Chromebook devices, and four computer
labs. These digital resources are borrowed through a fixed-schedule system (see Table 2).

Cross-curricular
According to the Standards for the 21st-Century Learner, skills taught to students should
be cross-curricular (AASL, 2007). These standards are set forth by the American Association of
School Librarians, or AASL, a subdivision of the American Library Association (ALA). State
standards may also be available to school librarians. In the I-SAIL (Illinois Standards Aligned
Instruction for Libraries) document from the State of Illinois, not only are national school
librarian standards reflected, but state and Common Core standards are included as well (AASL,
2007; CCSS, 2017; ISBE, 2017b; ISLMA, 2017).

Consequently, school librarians are

encouraged to teach library and media skills inclusively and collaboratively in partnership with
the classroom teacher (Butler, 2015).
In Chapter 4, I reported that incorporating technology across the curriculum was
important to my teacher participants. Having used the KWL strategy (Ogle, 1986) during the
focus group, or professional learning community meetings (Danielson, 2013) to collaborate, we

78
created planning sessions. One example from Chapter 4 came from collaborating with Ms. E.
Ms. E’s class was working on a myth unit. Ms. E incorporated a myth activity from the
Springboard English language arts textbook (CollegeBoard, 2005) with technology. I believe, in
this case, Ms. E. portrayed Innovator characteristics (Rogers, 2003). During our collaboration,
Ms. E. had the idea to use a digital drawing tool for the myth project. Ms. E used the
Springboard textbook (CollegeBoard, 2005) for guidelines during this activity. She was
enthusiastic about trying something new but nevertheless appropriate for the student activity.
Since there were no other teachers using the iPad Sketch (Tayasui, 2017) drawing application
with students, I found this to be the indicator to show Ms. E as an Innovator.

Attitudes
In Ertmer’s (1999) study regarding technology integration, she discusses hindrances to
change as “first-order” and “second-order” barriers. First-order barriers deal with external issues
such as having an insufficient number of computers in the school. However, second-order
barriers are personal. Reluctance to technology integration might mean there is an issue with
confidence in using the digital tools (Ertmer, 1999) .
In Chapter 4, I reported that of the four teacher participants, only one of the teachers, Ms.
B, expressed reluctance, or showed a second-order barrier. However, even though she was
apprehensive, she nevertheless wanted to move forward to learn about integrating digital tools.
Strategies for helping Ms. B included meeting and planning together, then taking some time to
model a technology-centered lesson for the students.
beneficial, as stated by Ms. B.

Support from colleagues was also

79
Collaboration
Collaboration between the school librarian and classroom teacher is recommended in the
Standards for the 21st-Century Learner (AASL, 2007). In addition, the I-SAIL (Illinois
Standards Aligned Instruction for Libraries) document from the State of Illinois provides a
breadth of information regarding collaboration between classroom teachers and school librarians
(ISLMA, 2017). Hence, on behalf of student learning, school librarians need to meet and
collaborate with classroom teachers embracing and leading change, as role models to help
students learn (Branch & Oberg, 2001; Dow, 2013).
Again, using the KWL strategy during the focus group, or PLC sessions, the teachers and
I engaged in collaboration for incorporating digital tools into instruction (Danielson, 2013; Ogle,
1986). It was during these times that we discussed new ideas for integration. In Ertmer’s (2005)
study, she points out similar strategies used during professional development to integrate
technology: (1) form small groups for learning new methods, (2) gradually introduce new
technology, and (3) support teachers during their learning (Ertmer, 2005) .
Ms. B and Ms. L both had positive experiences with students while integrating Kahoot.
As mentioned in the previous chapter, Kahoot is a quiz-like online game, free to use. Users of
Kahoot can create questions and answers for players. The game lends itself to creating Kahoot
games with content-rich information (Kahoot!, 2017). The introduction for Kahoot came from
teachers outside of this research team. Ms. B brought the idea of using it to the team after
collaborating with other teachers in the building. I found Ms. B to be showing Early Adopter
(Rogers, 2003) characteristics, given the Kahoot idea. As Rogers (2003) posits, once the benefit
of an idea can be seen, Early Adopters jump in to adopt the idea as well. The enthusiasm Ms. B

80
brought to the team when describing Kahoot was contagious. I believe the rest of the team also
became Early Adopters (Rogers, 2003) with Kahoot after discovering the value of using this
digital tool during instruction implemented by Ms. B and Ms. L. Consequently, Ms. L had a
novel idea for using Kahoot. In the previous chapter, it was mentioned that Ms. L used Kahoot
to record student learning over the course of the fall semester for the required teacher evaluation
activities (Danielson, 2013; ISBE, 2017c). She used Kahoot for a pretest at the start of the
semester. The pretest included course vocabulary. This method helped Ms. L to assess how
much students already knew about the curriculum she was going to be teaching. Finally, Ms. L
finished the semester by giving students a posttest using the Kahoot tool.
Ms. E showed strong qualities of an Early Adopter (Rogers, 2003). She expressed how
ready she was to get started using Google Apps for Education, now GSuite (Google, 2017).
Unfortunately, the school district had some policy issues with which to deal prior to the
introduction of GSuite in the school district. Therefore, Ms. E found a substitution in Edmodo
(Edmodo, 2017). Like Google, Edmodo is a free online application that promotes itself as a
safe, online, collaborative tool for collaboration between teachers and students (Edmodo, 2017).
The only other teachers I knew of who used Edmodo were teachers no longer employed by the
school district. Thus, Ms. E did not have many teachers to collaborate with regarding Edmodo,
other than our research team. Ms. E, however, moved forward. She and her students created
Edmodo accounts to collaborate with each other. As an English language arts teacher, she
wanted to be able to assess and give students immediate feedback on their writing. Previously,
students would type their essays, print them, then turn the essays in to Ms. E. Relative to student
learning, this process was taking too long in Ms. E’s opinion. She felt that using digital tools

81
with her students for collaborating was the efficient way to get feedback to students in a timelier
manner and, therefore was a better way for her students to learn. As a true Early Adopter
(Rogers, 2003), Ms. E introduced Edmodo to her English department colleagues and was able to
inspire another teacher in her department to become involved in using Edmodo with the
students.
In my collaboration activities with Mr. S, he has stated that he likes to innovate. He did
not mean as an Innovator in the context of Rogers’s (2003) description, but as a teacher working
on his craft as an educator. Regardless, I feel that Mr. S demonstrates Rogers’s (2003) Innovator
qualities. I would consider Mr. S a “collaborative innovator.” In the school, teachers are drawn
to Mr. S for technology help and ideas. He cheerfully and willingly helps both students and
teachers. When discussing his teaching philosophy, he expressed to me that he expects and
communicates to students that they too will be teachers in his classroom. On his walls, Mr. S has
a variety of posters filling up the spaces with ideas and tips for students to view just by looking
up at the posters on his wall. In addition, Mr. S has been called upon by the district to join
technology committees. He, in turn, has been a good communicator to the teachers in the
building.
As reported in Chapter 4, during our partnership for this research study, I presented Mr. S
with a WebQuest idea for introducing website evaluation (Dodge, 2017). The plan was to teach
website evaluation to his Advancement Via Individual Determination course, or AVID (AVID,
2017). Evaluation activities were incorporated into the “College and Career Readiness” project
within this class. The project objective was for students to present information on careers they
were considering. Possible colleges and universities were also presented as part of the

82
assignment. The WebQuest (Dodge, 2017) activity helped students better evaluate websites
during the course of completing the “College and Career Readiness” assignment. Neither Mr. S
nor I had incorporated the use of a WebQuest (Dodge, 2017) tool during instruction in the past.
This was new territory for both of us. We both took the risk, collaborated and ended up with a
successful website evaluation unit. In addition, the students had an additional tool to help them
evaluate websites while completing their AVID project. As a result of our partnership, Mr. S and
I both collaborated as Innovators (Rogers, 2003).

Assessment
Assessment did not emerge as a strong theme in this study. However, all teachers on the
research team participated in assessment activities throughout the course of my research, as
discussed in Chapter 4. For instance, Ms. B and Ms. E used the English language arts
Springboard text (CollegeBoard, 2005) when completing the myth activities that I observed as
part of the project. Ms. L’s participation employed a Kahoot activity for her district evaluation
and state Professional Evaluation Reform Act (Danielson, 2013; ISBE, 2017c) requirements,
including student assessments. In addition, Ms. L’s art portfolio student collections using
Animoto videos (Animoto, 2017) were also assessments, and Mr. S included an assessment
rubric in his “College and Career Readiness” assignment. Last, the WebQuest (Dodge, 2017)
activity that Mr. S and I incorporated also included a pretest, posttest, and rubric for assessing
student progress in website evaluation skills. Hence, assessment was present throughout the
progression of the study; however, it was not a primary reference from the teacher participants.

83
Time Management
Time management was referred to only three times by the teacher participants, perhaps
because in my study, time was not a barrier to integrating digital tools. As mentioned in Chapter
4, time management was a weak theme. Time is included here as a theme because it has been
referenced by other researchers as a barrier to technology integration (Ertmer, 2005; Johnston,
2012). The fact that time was so infrequently mentioned by my study group of teachers aligns
with Rogers’s (2003) element of time as described in his diffusion of innovations theory (Rogers,
2003). The Innovators group, at start of Rogers’s (2003) adopters category continuum, are the
individuals who need the least amount of time when considering an adoption of an idea.
Laggards need the most amount of time (Rogers, 2003). It is my observation that none of the
research team members showed characteristics of the Late Majority or Laggards groups -characteristics of both of these groups include needing time for the adoption (Rogers, 2003).
Thus, although time was mentioned by some of the teacher participants, it was not a strong
theme in my study.

Discussion Part Two: DELTA Model Derived from Grounded Theory Method
Review of Grounded Theory Method
In this study, I used a qualitative research design called grounded theory (Creswell, 2008;
Glaser & Strauss, 2012).

My research was conducted at a junior high school with four teacher

participants during the fall semester of 2016. Teacher participation was voluntary. Any student
participation was reported to me by the teacher research team members. Student interactions,
which occurred between myself and students, were in coordination with the teacher participants

84
or due to my position as the school librarian at the junior high in which the teacher participants
taught. Once teacher and principal approval was obtained, the research project proceeded.
Using interviews as a grounded theory method (Glaser & Strauss, 2012), the four teacher
participants and I coordinated meeting times for three focus group interview meetings. These
focus groups occurred once per month during the fall semester of 2016 (September, October and
November). Each instructor also participated in two individual interviews during my research
project. Since observations are also part of the grounded theory approach (Glaser & Strauss,
2012), the teachers and I included two classroom observations (where I observed the teacher and
students) per each of the four teacher classrooms over the course of the 2016 fall semester. Not
only did these methods reflect those found in grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 2012), but the
varied approaches using individual interviews, focus group interviews, observations and notetaking also provide a basis for triangulation of the data (Creswell, 2008; Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
The interview questions formed were based on the KWL model (What do I already Know? What
do I want to learn? What have I Learned?) formulated by Donna Ogle (1986). In my
instruction, I have utilized the KWL to show students what they have learned over time. This
strategy can be used to introduce a unit of study. As a culmination, students list what they have
learned at the end of the unit of study and then compare it with what was known at the beginning
of the unit. I was also inspired by the KWL activity done by Znnuda and Harada (2008) at a
state conference, in which they referenced how school librarians and classroom teachers work
and collaborate together (Znnuda & Harada, 2008). Since I have used the KWL questioning
framework to record how students’ knowledge evolves, I thought it was appropriate to
incorporate the KWL model to show a level of change in knowledge by the teacher participants.

85
I also recorded the teachers’ change in knowledge using Rogers’s (2003) diffusion of
innovations methods. Data collected from individual and focus group interviews and
observations were coded. Following the interviews and observations, I recorded field notes and
memos regarding my activities, teacher participant discussions, and classroom observations.
Further coding activities included using NVivo software (QSR, 2017). NVivo is a program
designed to help code qualitative, non-numerical data. I found NVivo to be useful in helping to
code and analyze the data for generating themes during this study. To review, the themes that
were generated from this data using grounded theory methods (Glaser & Strauss, 2012) were
Learning, Resources, Cross-curricular, Attitudes, Collaboration, Assessment, and Time
Management. These themes ultimately led me to develop the DELTA Framework theory
(Figure 5). This theory is discussed below.
Glaser and Strauss’s (2012) constant comparative method was utilized to generate the
DELTA Framework theory. This method is comprised of four steps: 1) comparing incidents
applicable to each category, 2) integrating categories and their properties, 3) delimiting theory,
and 4) writing the theory (Glaser & Strauss, 2012).
In the first step, comparing incidents applicable to each category (Glaser & Strauss,
2012), I began coding notes after the interview and observation sessions. These notes were also
placed in the NVivo program (QSR, 2017). Using NVivo allowed me to go deeper into the
coding process. Glaser and Straus’s (2012) procedure also allowed me to see comparisons and
connections between the teacher participant responses. These comparisons helped me to

determine categories or themes that were becoming apparent. As the themes emerged, memos
were created (Glaser & Strauss, 2012). These memos were used to explain how the DELTA
theory was generated.
The second step, integrating categories and their properties, allowed for “accumulating
knowledge” about these two items (Glaser & Strauss, 2012). By reexamining the categories, I
could see what commonalities existed between the teacher participants (these will be covered
later in this section). It would be these commonalities that I would focus on for generating
theory.
The third step, according to Glaser and Strauss (2012), is delimiting the theory. It is
during this step that refining occurs and irrelevant details are removed so the theory can be
generated. According to Glaser and Strauss (2012), by using fewer terms, the theory could be
generalized and applied to a variety of conditions (Glaser & Strauss, 2012). As a result, Glaser
and Straus (2012) consider these requirements in theory making 1) a parsimony of variables and
formulation and 2) the scope in the applicability of the theory to a wide range of situations.
The fourth step in constant comparative method is theory writing (Glaser & Strauss,
2012). Therefore, the particulars of my DELTA Framework overview will be examined later in
this chapter.

Summary of the DELTA Framework Theory
Themes which emerged during this study are fundamental elements of the DELTA
theory (see Figure 5). See Table 3 for the themes from the most prominent to least prominent, as
reflected in the teacher-participant responses. Summary of my theory then references parts of

88
these emergent themes. In addition, I allude to my DELTA Framework theory in responding to
my research questions as presented in this research. Elements pertaining to my research
questions are also a component of the DELTA theory (students, teachers, librarians).
The goal of this study was to address the following research questions:
How is a school librarian a change agent for improving technology practices in a junior
high school?
•

What are strategies that allow the school librarian to act as an agent of change for
meaningful technology integration in the junior high school setting with teachers?

•

What are strategies that allow the school librarian to act as an agent of change for
meaningful technology integration in the junior high school setting with students?

The word “change” was important to me during this research. I believed the concept of
change signified growth and learning which occurred over the course of this study. School
librarians are in a position to make changes to improve technology integration practices
(Hanson-Baldauf & Hassell, 2009; Johnston, 2012). Since the delta symbol traditionally
signifies change (2017), I elected to use the symbol in the visual representation of my theory. I
determined the placement of teachers, students, and librarians along the sides of the delta image,
since the research questions posed were aimed at these individuals. In the center of the delta
shape is the word “learning.” As noted in the findings, the teacher participants referred to
learning more than any other concept; therefore, learning was the most prominent theme in this
study. Collaboration also emerged as a theme. The Standards for the 21st-Century Learner
document outlines collaboration recommendations for school librarians and teachers (AASL,
2007). To signify collaboration on the image, two-headed arrows were added inside the delta.

89
The two-headed arrows are to show that learning is not just one sided. During this research, the
teachers, students and myself as the school librarian, all learned from each other due to
circumstances that included collaboration efforts. The “Academic Community” surrounds the
delta image. “Academic Community” includes parents, administrators, support staff and
families because, I believe, it is the entire organization that supports this learning. Subsequently,
the use of the constant comparative method for theory writing helped me to determine the
components of the DELTA Framework theory (Glaser & Strauss, 2012).
The acronym DELTA (Digital Tools, Engagement, Librarians, Teachers, All Learners)
describes the remaining elements of my theory.

Digital Tools
Resources emerged as a strong theme. Respondents discovered digital tools to
incorporate into their instruction. Support for utilizing digital tools came from the school
librarian, other colleagues and even students. Since many online or Web 2.0 tools are free to
use, the teacher participants and myself could utilize these tools in our teaching. Resources,
therefore, emerged as a significant development of the study. The digital tools that were utilized
in this study are listed in Chapter 4 (see Table 2).

Engagement
Engagement (student and teacher) strategies can be found through collaborating with
peers. As stated in Chapter 4, many activities planned for students were cross-curricular. Some

90
of the English language arts activities included creating art with comics using ComicLife
(Plasq, 2017) and drawing with Sketch (Tayasui, 2017). These activities helped to motivate and
engage students for learning. Drama and graphic arts students created iMovies (Apple, 2017)
and Animoto slide shows (Animoto, 2017). All teacher participants and their students enjoyed
playing the Kahoot (Kahoot!, 2017) game. These activities came about through collaboration
during the professional learning community (PLC) meetings, which also served as our focus
groups.

Librarians
Standards for the 21st-Century Learner (AASL, 2007) and the I-SAIL (Illinois Standards
Aligned Instruction for Libraries) document from the State of Illinois provide a wide range of
material regarding collaboration between classroom teachers and school librarians (ISLMA,
2017). Mr. S was particularly interested in incorporating information literacy skills with the
Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) students. Since I am the school librarian,
Mr. S wanted to tap into my knowledge of website evaluation. So, together, he and I worked on
creating a WebQuest on website evaluation (Dodge, 2017).

Teachers
In addition to standards, Danielson’s teacher evaluation instrument also provides ideas
for working with colleagues (Danielson, 2013). Collaboration emerged as a theme in my study.
Teachers and school librarians must reference the Danielson model (Danielson, 2013) for our
evaluation activities. One of the elements is collaboration. The collaborative efforts between the

91
teachers and me were documented in our focus group meetings, which also served as a
professional learning community (PLC).

All Learners
Learning is a cooperative experience. Students learn from teachers, and teachers learn
from students. In Mr. S’s words, “Learning is motivation.” Learning surfaced as the strongest
theme. Our job as teachers is to help students learn (Branch & Oberg, 2001; Butler, 2015;
Hopkins, 1998). Throughout my study, students were observed learning with digital tools.
Students were engaged in using Edmodo (Edmodo, 2017) during language arts. Students learned
website evaluation skills with a WebQuest (Dodge, 2017) during AVID. Students even enjoyed
assessment with Kahoot (Kahoot!, 2017) in all of the teacher participants’ classes. Although we
teachers were in the role of teaching our students, it was stated that the students taught us as well.

Themes which surfaced in my research are essential elements of the DELTA theory.
Themes from the most prominent to least prominent, as reflected in the teacher-particpant
statements were Learning, Resources, Cross-curricular, Attitudes, Collaboration, Assessment,
and Time Management. Elements relating to my research questions are also a part of my
DELTA theory (students, teachers, librarians). Along with the visual representation, the DELTA
Framework theory can also be summarized with the acronym DELTA (Digital tools,
Engagement, Librarians, Teachers, All learners). To begin generating the theory, data from
memos were used (see Table 4).

visual representation look with these elements? Delta is a triangle symbolizing change. Use

imagery with Google, GSuite (Google, 2017).

The DELTA Framework Theory began with a variety of memos over the progression of
my study. Early on during this research, I wanted to use a pyramid as the visual representation
of my theory. Once themes began to emerge during the coding process, the visual representation
began to take shape. Table 5 documents the progression of the visual. The word “delta” came at
the end of the progression after my realization that a pyramid is the representation for “change.”

Each phase of the DELTA theory visual representation is explained within the image.
The progression begins with a pyramid shape and then progresses to end with the pyramid
enclosed within a circle. The labels within the image come from the emerging themes as
reported in my study.

Review of Limitations
My research was completed at one school. The number of members on the research team
was, therefore, limited. Additionally, I, as a participant of the research team, took part not only
as a researcher but also as a member. Participation in my research was voluntary by all
members.
Implications
My research implications illustrate how the school librarian works with other teachers to
benefit student learning. In my research, the teacher participants stressed the importance of

96
student learning more than any of the other evolving themes. Given the DELTA framework,
school librarians now have a model with which to help all learners succeed through digital tool
use.
Future Research Considerations
Future research can be conducted with a similar research model. Since my research
included only four junior high teachers, future research can be conducted with a larger number of
instructors. In addition, specific groups of instructors to study can be identified, such as
elementary teachers and high school teachers. Other groups to consider doing this research
project with would include administrators, parents, students and other librarians. Each group
would bring about their insights into technology integration in the school.

Conclusion
During my research, I examined how the school librarian acts as a change agent for
improving technology integration practices in a junior high school. I collaborated with four
junior high school teachers using grounded theory methods (Glaser & Strauss, 2012). The
themes that emerged during this research were studied and then developed into a theory. I call
this theory the DELTA Framework theory. The acronym DELTA contains the elements within
the theory (Digital tools, Engagement, Librarians, Teachers, All Learners). According to Glaser
and Strauss (2012) the theory should also be signified with a visual representation. The visual
representation is included and explained in this study. It is my aim to provide this theory to help
other school librarians become change agents for the integration of digital tools in their own
programs.
