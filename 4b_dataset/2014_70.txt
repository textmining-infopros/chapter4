THE REPLEVIN PROCESS IN GOVERNMENT ARCHIVES:
RECOVERY AND THE CONTENTIOUS QUESTION OF OWNERSHIP
Eleanor Mattern, PhD
University of Pittsburgh, 2014
To an attorney practicing law in the common law system, the term “replevin” describes a legal
remedy for recovering personal property held by another party. In this civil procedure, the
determination of rightful ownership falls to the court. Archivists and manuscript collectors have
appropriated this same term to describe any effort by a government archives to recover public
records in private hands, whether these efforts involve the courts or are carried out informally
through discussions and negotiations with private parties. The number of “true” replevin cases
involving disputed public records is small and existing commentary in the archival literature
focus on these judicial decisions. This dissertation examines the quieter cases, developing a
sharper understanding of what replevin means to individuals who are charged with preserving
records and to those who are personally driven to collect. Three state archives serve as case
studies and semi-structured interviews with institutional employees, archival records, active
records, statute and case law as data sources.
A consistent message emerging from discussions with government officials is that each
replevin case is singular in the manner in which it is resolved. Still, there is an apparent pattern to
the replevin of public records, conceptualized in this dissertation as a six-stage process. Each
case begins with the discovery of the alienated record and results in a custody determination
favoring either the government or the private party. This dissertation determines that variances in
statute, case law, and the involvement of legal counsel strongly influence a government’s

iv

decision to pursue, the shape of negotiations, and the state’s ultimate ability to recover the
targeted record.
The issue of replevin is one that has provoked friction between the community of
government archivists and some members of the collecting community, a friction largely
stemming from an ambiguous understanding of the nature of a “public record” and disagreement
as to whether an archives should lay claim to records that never have been in its possession. This
study probes the motivations of public officials pursuing public records and argues that it is in
the public interest for public archives to have an active replevin agenda.

PREFACE

In the fall of 2010, Dr. Bernadette Callery lent me a book. My readers who were fortunate to
know Bernadette likely remember a book or two – or many more – that she directed their way.
This particular recommendation was journalist David Howard’s Lost Rights, his 2010 account of
the State of North Carolina’s recovery of its original copy of the Bill of Rights. Recognizing my
interests in issues of ownership and repatriation, Bernadette, along with my equally supportive
advisor Dr. Richard J. Cox, helped to position me on the path that resulted in this study on
replevin. Often, as I wrote these pages, I thought of Bernadette. I like to think that she would
have had as much fun reading this dissertation as I had learning from her.
To my dissertation committee members, I thank you. Dr. Richard J. Cox, thank you for
deepening my appreciation for the tremendous societal impact that archivists are capable of
yielding. Like Bernadette, your influence helped shape this document. Dr. Brian Beaton deserves
my heartfelt thanks for providing consistent words of encouragement and for posing those
fantastic questions that left me reflecting for days. I am fortunate that I had a “legal team” in Dr.
Kip Currier and Dr. Tomas Lipinski. One of the most meaningful compliments I’ve ever
received is your affirmation that I would have done well in a law school property class. For your
involvement in this project, my sincere thanks.
There are many information professionals and scholars who supported me during the
development of this work. My sincere thanks to Dr. Roland Baumann, Attorney Karen Blum,

Sarah Buffington, Dr. Kevin Cherry, Dr. Elizabeth Dow, Lyndon Hart, Dr. David Haury, Sarah
Koonts, Linda Ries, and the archivists at the State Archives of North Carolina, the Pennsylvania
State Archives, and the Library of Virginia. Since 2010, the ARMA International Educational
Foundation, the members of the Pittsburgh Chapter of ARMA International, and Preston Shimer
have honored me with their interest and support of this work. My sincere thanks to you.
I am fortunate for the community I found at the School of Information Sciences at the
University of Pittsburgh and in this city. To the faculty, staff, and students at the University,
thank you for your guidance and assistance throughout the years. Special thanks to Dr. Joel
Blanco, Dr. Leanne Bowler, Dr. Sheila Corrall, Debbie Day, James King, Alison Langmead,
Lindsay Mattock, and Tonia Sutherland.
Finally, to Kristy Borza, Andrew Brown, Cassie Rubino, Justine Rubino, Philip Toney,
and Matt Zuwaila: you made Pittsburgh a home to me. All my love to my parents, Hap and Mary
Mattern; to my sisters, Tess, Kate, and Libby Mattern; and to my brother, Neil Mattern. This
one’s for you.

I. THE RESEARCH PROBLEM

The purpose of this research is to examine the replevin process in the archival field in the United
States, a process that is largely distinct from the codified legal procedure that occurs in the
American judicial system. Attorneys practicing in the United States likely first encounter a
discussion about replevin in a first-year property course in law school. They understand replevin
to be a common law writ that initiates a civil proceeding to determine ownership of personal
property that a plaintiff argues is unlawfully held by another party. Archivists, on the other hand,
generally use the term to describe any governmental effort to recover public records in private
hands, whether these efforts involve the courts or are carried out informally through discussions
and negotiations with private parties.
As a common law remedy, replevin has a long legal history, but the archival literature
and a review of case law reveals that there are relatively few court decisions in which the
disputed property was a public record. In 1939, Randolph G. Adams of the National Archives
and Records Administration (NARA) pointed to this scarcity. In describing NARA’s attempts to
obtain information from the United States Department of Justice and the University of Michigan
Law School about replevin cases involving public records, Adams reports that the Attorney
General’s Office was unable to locate any such cases and that the University of Michigan’s law

1

librarian identified very few. 2 The challenge encountered by Adams and his colleagues continues
to persist today. While some discussion in the literature exists on these cases, namely on United
States of America v. First Trust Company of Saint Paul and State of North Carolina v. B.C. West,
Jr., the informal nature that typically characterizes replevin actions in the archival field has
resulted in little presence on the topic in the literature. A survey of the websites of government
archives, however, reveals that institutions are disseminating information to the public about the
nature of public records and governmental efforts to recover alienated public records with
archival value. NARA has attempted to publicize its recovery agenda both through information
available on the Internet and through media outlets like CBS’s 60 Minutes. State archives,
including California, Maine, and Tennessee, make explicit mention of replevin policies and
pertinent laws on their websites. 3 There have not, however, been court cases dealing with
replevin of records in all states that have publicized their replevin efforts, suggesting, again, that
this term is used more generally to describe government efforts to recover public records.
There is a challenge in developing a composite portrait of replevin of public records.
Because the judicial system in the United States, with the exception of Louisiana, is based on the
English common law tradition, replevin exists in all states as a tool for individuals seeking the
recovery of personal property. There are, however, variances among states that have a bearing on
the practice of recovering public records. The consequences of these variances are demonstrated
through the case studies. North Carolina has a stringent statute in place that outlines the
government’s ability to recover public records and case law precedent in the form of State of

North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. The Library of Virginia has a replevin statute and two court
opinions, one that favored the Commonwealth of Virginia and the other that was a divided
success for the state and the private party. Pennsylvania lacks both. This dissertation does not
trace a process that is consistent from state to state. Instead, this dissertation examines how the
legal framework shapes the general processes of replevin of public records. Moreover, I consider
the implications that the legal framework of statutes and case law has for providing definition to
the meaning of “public record” and for understanding the separating line between public versus
private ownership of property.

I.A. SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY
The significance of this study is that it brings into view a process that has largely been internal to
archival institutions. The Library of Virginia, for example, disseminates information about its
program to gain custody of alienated documents on its website, but this information does little to
contribute to an understanding of how the Commonwealth learns of the alienated records and the
steps that follow. 4 By examining cases in which state repositories recovered public records
through negotiations and agreements with private parties, this dissertation brings the replevin
process in the archival field to the foreground and considers whether an understanding of these
cases transforms our understanding of replevin. The most basic contribution of this dissertation is
that it builds upon the sparse writing concerning the archival understanding of the term
“replevin” and interprets the processes for recovery that occur within state archives.

This research is intended to inform both the archival community and the collecting
community, two distinct groups with an interest in ownership issues as they pertain to public
records. There is a practical significance of this study for collectors and archival professionals
alike. If a government archives identifies a record that is in the possession of a private party or in
a non-government archives as a “public” record, the individual or institution may be mandated to
transfer physical custody and ownership to the government. The reasoning behind the
government’s ability to claim these records will be outlined in the literature review below, but it
is a consequence of the “inalienability” of public records and the records retention schedules
codified in federal and state law.
It may be the case, however, that archival practitioners and private collectors are
unaware of how to recognize whether a record in their collection indeed belongs to the
government. Oliver H. Holmes alludes to this in his 1960 article “‘Public Records’ – Who
Knows What They Are?” in American Archivist. He writes, “In connection with efforts to
replevin public records that somehow have escaped from public custody, uncertainty exists on
both sides because of conflicting views and definitions of public records.” 5 Research that
identifies how both the repositories on the state level characterize records that they deem to be
their rightful property would be valuable to both archival practitioners and members of the
collecting community. In addition, because of the absence of discussion about replevin in the
literature, there are limited means through which government repositories can learn from one
another about replevin efforts. With this research, there is an opportunity to inform the
government archival community of activities and policies related to the identification and
recovery of public records that are occurring in a sample set of states.

This study, through a perhaps somewhat unexpected lens, contributes to an understanding
of appraisal decisions by government repositories. Appraisal entails decision-making on the part
of the archivist. Postmodern archival scholars have observed that this allows for subjectivity to
creep into the stacks and governmental repositories are certainly not an exception. Public
archivists necessarily limit the scope of the narrative through the appraisal function. David
Haury, State Archivist of Pennsylvania, has stated that government repositories generally select
only 2.5-3% of public records to be accessioned. 6 David S. Ferriero, Archivist of the United
States, offers a similar estimate in NARA’s “Performance and Accountability Report” for the
2011 fiscal year, approximating that 2-3% of federal records are preserved by the federal
repository. 7 By initiating a replevin action, a government archives signals that the record in
question is one that has archival value, falling within this small percentage of records that are
chosen to be preserved indefinitely. Not all public records that are in private hands are pursued.
Instead, there is a selection process at work here, which this dissertation addresses through
replevin cases in three states.
There is a theoretical and legal significance to this study as well. This dissertation draws
upon the legal literature on property and contributes to the corpus of scholarship that focuses on
the distinctions between public and private ownership. In particular, this study situates the
replevin of public records within the context of government “takings.” Eminent domain is the
most familiar illustration of the government’s seizure of property owned by a private party. At
first blush, there appears to be a definite contrast between the notion of eminent domain and

government’s replevin of public records. Eminent domain, as defined by Black’s Law
Dictionary, is “the inherent power of a governmental entity to take privately owned property,
esp[ecially] land, and convert it to public use, subject to reasonable compensation for the
taking.” 8 The power of eminent domain works in concert with the fifth amendment of the United
States Constitution to require just compensation for seized private property. When a government
archives seeks the recovery of a public record from a private individual or institution, it is doing
so because the record is perceived to be public, and not private, property. Therefore the position
of public officials may be that no compensation is required to the private party. A government
archives classifies this practice as replevin, as the archives is claiming records that it considers
the government’s property. The dividing line between replevin of public records and eminent
domain becomes blurred, however, if there is ambiguity or disagreement surrounding whether
the record in question is indeed “public.” If a collector does not acknowledge that the record is
public property and instead perceives it to be private property that is now being taken for public
use, he or she might argue that, under the Constitution of the United States, the government must
provide compensation for the seizure of the record. The recovery of public records is situated
within the concepts of replevin and takings as a way to illustrate the competing perceptions of
the practice – the perceptions of the government archives and the perceptions of many in the
collecting community.

I.B. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
This dissertation addresses two research questions:

Question 1: What do replevin cases settled by state archives and private parties reveal about the
government’s process for the recovery of public records in private hands?

Question 2: How do these cases transform, if they do, our understanding of replevin and the
distinguishing line between private and public ownership?

I.C. CORE CONCEPTS TO STUDY
Replevin
Black’s Law Dictionary, a principal reference text for the legal profession that is now in its ninth
printing, defines replevin as “an action for the repossession of personal property wrongfully
taken or detained by the defendant, whereby the plaintiff gives security for and holds the
property until the court decides who owns it.” 9 It is, as Behrnd-Klodt describes, a remedy that a
party can employ in order to regain personal property “from one who has taken it wrongfully or
holds it unlawfully.” 10 Peterson and Peterson explain that an archival repository technically
exercises a replevin action when it sues another party for the return of a document. 11

The archival community’s understanding of replevin does not depart fully from its
meaning in the legal field. However, archivists have expanded its definition to describe the
transfer (or attempts for transfer) of public records in the possession of private parties to a
government repository. The glossary of the Society of American Archivists (hereafter “SAA”)
defines replevin as “an action to recover property that has been improperly or illegally taken,”
but the note that follows this description captures the reality of how the archival community
often interprets the term. Glossary author Richard Pearce-Moses writes, “Replevin is frequently
used to describe efforts to recover public records that are in private hands.” 12 The archival
community’s broader use of the term, as Peterson and Peterson note in their Archives and
Manuscripts: Law, is not always technically faithful to the legal understanding of replevin. 13
Public Records
As the literature review addresses, there is ambiguity surrounding the definition of “public
records” in the United States. This ambiguity may be the consequence of variances in the
definitions that are embedded in public records laws and the synonymous use of the term to
describe records that are created by government agencies and records that are open for the
public’s access. The latter issue is reflected in SAA’s Glossary of Archive and Records
Terminology, which provides multiple meanings of the term. The first definition describes public
records as “[d]ata or information in a fixed format that was created or received by a government
agency in the course of business and that is preserved for future reference.” 14 However, the
glossary also provides a description of public records as “[g]overnment records that are not

restricted and are accessible to the public.” 15 For the purpose of this dissertation, the label of
“public record” is understood as pertaining to records that fall within the parameters of the first
definition that Pearce-Moses identifies.
Takings
An understanding of the concept of takings begins with a reading of the Fifth Amendment of the
United States Constitution. Commonly referred to as the “Takings Clause,” the final line in the
Fifth Amendment states, “Nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just
compensation.” 16 The Takings Clause extends to the government the power to appropriate
property that is owned by a private party, but protects citizens by requiring fair payment in
return. A government takings is, when used in this dissertation, referring to a governmental
seizure of personal property for a public purpose. The constitutionality of a taking rests in
whether the government provides the “just compensation” to the previous owner.

I.D. CASE STUDIES
Three state archives serve as case studies in this study of replevin. This section serves as an
overview of these government archival programs and addresses factors that are particularly
relevant to the dissertation research: the year of establishment of the archives, relevant public
records statutes, and case law precedent related to replevin of public records. 17 Public records

This dissertation follows the Chicago style for citations. For legal publications, however, The Chicago Manual of
Style recommends that writers employ one of two citation styles that are commonly used in the legal profession: The
Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation the ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation. The legal
citations in this proposal follow Bluebook style. In keeping with this style, the legal citations for court cases include
abbreviations for court names, court reporters (a publication reporting a court decision), title of state code, and
governmental body. These are outlined in the Bluebook style manual.

that were created prior to the origin of the archives and that otherwise would have been selected
as archival may today be in the hands of private individuals. Efforts of government archives to
recover public records that were never in the custody of the public archives call attention to the
tensions between private and public ownership and individual versus government property rights.
The year of establishment of the archival programs is of note in discovering whether law and
institutional policy allow for the recovery of records that predated the origin of the archives.
This introductory section identifies the statutes and case law in the jurisdictions, as these
facets may have direct bearing on the government’s ability to recover public records. Public
records laws define the nature of public records and, thus, the materials that may be subject to a
replevin claim by a government archives. Government archives also draw upon relevant statutes
that codify disposal processes and specifically statutes that address replevin of public records
when substantiating a claim to records in private hands. Finally, existing case law is a
meaningful element in the study of three states. Given that the American legal system is of the
common law tradition, described in the literature review below, government archives can cite
court precedent related to replevin of public records when making a claim for ownership of a
record in private hands. Moreover, if a replevin case reaches the courts, the judge will look to
precedent in cases that bear similarities to the one he or she is adjudicating and shape a decision
with the precedent in mind.
This study originally proposed NARA as a case study in order to learn about federal
efforts to recover records in private hands. In August of 2013, I visited Archives II in College
Park, Maryland, which houses military record collections and the records of federal agencies.
There, I planned to spend time with Record Group 64, the records of NARA, and, in particular
the series of the Records of the Office of the Archivist of the United States. This proved more

10

difficult than expected, as there are large gaps in what has been processed of the administrative
records beyond the 1960s. While it was possible to access records related to NARA’s pursuit of
the Clark journals, it was not possible to appreciate the shape of the more common replevin
cases, those that are resolved between the archives and private parties, from the archival
evidence. Because of the importance of archival records to this study, the case of NARA was
necessarily abandoned. The time did not allow for a project that would hinge on access through
FOIA requests alone. One NARA archivist was apologetic about the unavailability of records,
applying the adage of “cobbler’s children have no shoes” to the situation involving his agency’s
processing backlog and its own records.
North Carolina
The year 1964 saw the publication of Ernst Posner’s American State Archives, a work that Lester
J. Cappon posited would “become at once a landmark in the field of American archives,
indispensable to the archivist and valuable to the historian in many ways he might not suspect
from the title.” 18 For the purposes of this study, Posner’s work is beneficial in tracing the origin
of the State Archives of North Carolina, the Pennsylvania State Archives, and the Library of
Virginia, as well as for locating relevant public records statutes in these states.
Posner’s history of the State Archives of North Carolina stretches back to January of
1903, with the passage of Chapter 767, Public Laws of 1903 and the subsequent establishment of
the North Carolina Historical Commission as a collecting body for the state. It was in 1935,
however, that “the commission’s authority was dramatically strengthened by the Public Records
Act of 1935,” which extended to the commission the power to oversee the disposal of state and

local records in North Carolina. 19 Multiple reorganizations of the state archival program have
occurred since 1935, including the transformation of the commission into the larger Department
of Archives and History in 1943. In the 1940s, this department was segmented into multiple
divisions, one of which was the Division of Archives and Manuscripts. 20
Today, the State Archives of North Carolina is part of the Division of Archives and
Records of North Carolina, an entity within the Department of Cultural Resources. 21 The duties
and authority of the Department of Cultural Resources are codified in Chapter 121 of the North
Carolina General Statutes. 22 The same chapter serves to define the State Archives as the official
repository for public records and relevant documentation that the state archivist deems to have
“sufficient historical or other value to warrant their continued preservation. 23 The original North
Carolina Historical Commission remains intact as a 12-member policymaking body that
nominates the Deputy Secretary of the Office of Archives and History. 24 Like the Pennsylvania
Historical and Museum Commission, the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources
encompasses a number of parts and Figure 1 represents its contemporary structural organization.
The Public Records Act of 1935 is integrated within Chapter 132 of the North Carolina
General Statutes. 25 The chapter provides a definition for public records in North Carolina,
explaining that it includes all record types – both analog and digital in nature – that were “made
or received pursuant to law or ordinance in connection with the transaction of public business by

destruction of public records are actions that are expressly forbidden by North Carolina law
without the permission of the Department of Cultural Resources, the umbrella agency for the
State Archives of North Carolina. 27

Two sections in Chapter 132 are of particular significance to this study and are notable
for their explicit and stringent parameters regarding the custody of public records. Coupled, the
sections provide for criminal and civil consequences for a party that is non-compliant in
transferring a public record to the state. The first is section 132-5, titled “Demanding Custody,”
which states:

26
27

N.C. Gen. Stat. § 132-1.
N.C. Gen. Stat. § 132-3.

13

Whoever is entitled to the custody of public records shall demand them
from any person having illegal possession of them, who shall forthwith
deliver the same to him. If the person who unlawfully possesses public
records shall without just cause refuse or neglect for 10 days after a
request made in writing by any citizen of the State to deliver such
records to their lawful custodian, he shall be guilty of a Class 1
misdemeanor. 28
The law is clear: the state has the power to order the transfer of state records that are in the
possession of a private party. If the individual refuses to turn over the records to the state
following a formal request, they are committing a criminal infraction that may result in a
misdemeanor charge.
The section immediately following, section 132-5.1, is titled “Regaining custody; civil
remedies." It identifies the civil procedure for recovering a public record in North Carolina. If an
unauthorized party is in possession of a public record, the Department of Cultural Resources or a
public official who is the rightful custodian of the public record may initiate the court’s
intervention. A petition is filed with the superior court in the county where the individual in
possession of the record resides. If the judge determines that the record in question is indeed
“public” in nature and that the person in possession of the record does not have the legal or
authorized right to it, he or she will order that the record be delivered to the petitioning party. If
the order is not fulfilled, the court may hold the noncompliant party in civil contempt, which is
defined by Black’s Law Dictionary as the “failure to obey a court order that was issued for
another party’s benefit.” 29
Section 132-5.1 governs custody of public records in the state of North Carolina; the
county superior courts do not have the jurisdiction when the public records in question are in the
possession of an individual residing in another state. Records, of course, can easily move outside

the borders of the state of North Carolina via Internet retailers like eBay. If the petitioning public
official fears that a public record in private hands is poised to leave the state, he or she may react
by filing an ex parte petition with the court, which is a petition that is “taken or granted at the
instance and for the benefit of one party only, and without notice to, or contestation by, any
person adversely interested.” 30 This allows for more immediate action for the petitioner. There
are two potential remedies that the court may issue under section 132.5-1: the judge may direct
the county sheriff to seize the records that are in question and deliver them to the court or the
judge may file an injunction that prevents the “sale, removal, disposal, or destruction of or
damage to” the public record. 31
Court precedent in North Carolina has contributed to the state’s ability to reclaim public
records. Much of the archival writing related to replevin makes reference to the 1970s case of
State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. While the above statute related to recovery was enacted
in 1975, this court case, in which North Carolina was victorious, “turned on common law” alone;
the statute was not employed as ammunition in North Carolina’s claim. 32 North Carolina was
again successful thirty years after the ruling in State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. with the
state’s recovery of one of the original fourteen copies of the Bill of Rights. The circumstances
surrounding both of these notable cases will be outlined in the literature review.
Pennsylvania
Writings on the development of the Pennsylvania State Archives, namely the accounts written by
Posner, Frank B. Evans, and Louis M. Waddell, begin with a discussion of the 19th century
custom of publishing state records. Archival "preservation," at this time, was carried out through
Black's Law Dictionary 576 (6th ed. 1990).

an act of copying, with designated documents selected for publication in Colonial Records and
Pennsylvania Archives. This practice, as Evans explains, in reality did little to preserve the
records. Original records were altered and mishandled by printers and there was no final home
for the published and unpublished records. 33
Like North Carolina, Pennsylvania’s state archives originated in 1903, with the
establishment of the Division of Public Records as an entity within Pennsylvania’s State
Library. 34 The Division of Public Records was initially given authority over records that
predated 1750, meaning that the body did not have the ability to “demand” custody of records
that were created after this date. It was a restriction that was soon eradicated in 1911 and, as
Waddell tells it, had little impact on the actual collecting practices in the institution’s earliest
years. 35
Today, the Pennsylvania State Archives is located within a changed organizational
structure, which is illustrated in Figure 2. Title 37 in the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes,
generally referred to as Pennsylvania’s History Code, establishes the role and authority of the
Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC). The PHMC is the governmental
agency that is charged with “the conservation of Pennsylvania’s historic and natural heritage and
the preservation of public records, historic documents and objects of historic interest, and the
identification, restoration, and preservation of architecturally and historically significant sites and
structures.” 36 While not mentioned in the History Code, the PHMC encompasses the following
entities: the State Museum of Pennsylvania, the Bureau of Historic Sites and Museums, the

Section 305 of the History Code outlines the PHMC’s authority in relation to public
records. The law stipulates that it is the responsibility of the PHMC to preserve inactive public
records of historic value. It states the agency shall be “the legal custodian of any public records
transferred to it by any Commonwealth agency or political subdivision.” 38 However,
Pennsylvania’s state laws regarding its public records may be characterized as muted and even
weak in comparison to those on the books in other states. It is interesting to note that there is no

mention of the Pennsylvania State Archives in the language of the History Code itself. David
Haury, State Archivist of Pennsylvania, maintains that this omission is to the detriment of the
State Archives. He writes, “Almost all state archival programs are subdivisions of agencies with
broader responsibilities, but the failure specifically to identify the Pennsylvania State Archives
and its role in Pennsylvania’s statutes tends to dilute its identity and authority.” 39 The
consequence of the State Archives’ absence in the legislation on its ability to replay public
records will be examined in this dissertation.
The History Code both references and builds upon another piece of legislation. Haury
points to the Administrative Code of 1929 as establishing a records management program in the
state, with Section 524 focusing on the “Disposition of Useless Records.” When state
government bodies identify records that are older than four years and that are no longer
necessary for their current and future functioning, the Administrative Code stipulates that the
heads of government entities will “submit to the Executive Board and to the Pennsylvania
Historical and Museum Commission a report of that fact, accompanied by a concise statement of
the condition, quantity and character of such papers.” 40 The Executive Board is defined in
Section 204 of the Administrative Code of 1929 as a group composed of the Governor of
Pennsylvania and six agency heads who are appointees of the Governor. 41 If the Executive Board
confirms that the records are no longer needed for active use by the government and if the
PHMC determines that the records do not have long-term historical and informational value,
state agencies may transfer the records to the Department of Property and Supplies. Under

Section 524, this department has the authority to then discard records as they would “waste
paper.” 42 Of course, there is an alternate route that the records may take. The Executive Board, in
conjunction with the PHMC, may direct that the records be transferred to the custody of the
PHMC. 43 According to Haury, there have been changes proposed regarding the Executive
Board’s role in approving every records retention and disposition schedule. However, the shared
responsibility remains as dictated by the Administrative Code of 1929, legislation that has
remained relatively stagnant since its enactment. 44
Importantly, unlike North Carolina, there is no codified statute related to replevin of
public records. This is not to say that the Pennsylvania State Archives is unable to use the
common law remedy for the recovery of public records. The procedure through which a party
may recover property exists in the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. However, the case
study of Pennsylvania serves as a foil to North Carolina, a state that is armed with a strong law
and a strong court precedent in this area. Pennsylvania has neither, the implications of which will
be explored in this dissertation.

Virginia
Before a formal records management program in Virginia existed, there was war. Ernst Posner,
in his American State Archives, argues that Virginia’s colonial and records predating 1865 “were
practically annihilated as a result of frequent fires and relocations of the capital, destruction
during the Revolutionary War, and finally the burning of Richmond by the Confederates before

their evacuation and the pillage of the Union troops.” 45 War’s effects on Virginia’s records is a
theme that weaves through Chapter 6, with a number of the replevin cases beginning with the
government’s loss of custody during periods of unrest.
Virginia’s state library has nearly 200-year history, originating in 1823 as a creation of
the Virginia General Assembly. 46 The Library of Virginia (originally called the Virginia State
Library) was not, however, the initial custodian of Commonwealth records in the 19th century.
The governor gave that authority to the Secretary of the Commonwealth in 1832. 47 Still, the
library administration worked to regain custody of the alienated records by securing copies of
what was in the English repositories, a practice that other states engaged in as well in the 19th
century. 48 At the turn of the 20th century, there was a shift in authority, with the State Library, led
by the State Librarian and State Librarian Board, becoming the custodian of the records of the
Commonwealth. 49 As the century advanced, the Library’s role and authority as record keepers of
the Commonwealth grew and culminated with the passage of the modern Virginia Public
Records Act in 1976. 50 The current organizational structure of the Library of Virginia is
illustrated in Figure 3.
The Virginia Public Records Act, found in sections 42.1-76 to 42.1-91 of the Code of
Virginia, is relevant to this study in a number of ways. First, Chapter 6 of this dissertation
considers the definitions of “public record” and “private record” and what these definitions mean

for replevin efforts. Second, the Virginia Public Records Act codifies the authority of the Library
of Virginia as administrator of the Commonwealth’s records management program and requires
that all Commonwealth agencies abide by the established records retention and disposition
schedules. 51 Third, section 42.1-88 makes it illegal for a Commonwealth employee to retain the
public records created or received during his or her employment or term in an elected office upon
departure from a position. 52 This stipulation is at the crux of a recent replevin case involving the
papers of a former Governor of Virginia, discussed in Chapter Six.

There is a collection of public officials in Virginia who have prominent roles to play in
the management and preservation of public records on the local level: circuit court clerks. The
office of the court clerk has a long history in Virginia, one tracing back to the colony and is

today an elected county position. 53 They are the stewards of local county and city court
records. 54 The Virginia Public Records Act addresses the relationship between the Library of
Virginia and these local records custodians. The statute allows for archival county, city, and
town records to be preserved at either the Library of Virginia or the locality. If the records are
stored at the Library of Virginia, the local official retains the right to request their return. 55 As
the Director of Description Services at the Library of Virginia explains, “We have always
collected local records but one of the anomalies of Virginia is that local records always remain
the property of the circuit court clerk. So we have them here and we make them accessible so
people can use them. But if a clerk were to come in and say, ‘We’d like those back,’ we’d have
to give them back. That happens very rarely because they take up a lot of space but occasionally
there will be a clerk [who requests them]. And occasionally there will be local pressure for the
clerk not to get rid of them.” 56
The Virginia Public Records Act’s handling of replevin is markedly similar to what is
codified by the North Carolina General Statutes. In Bain’s 1983 analysis of state public records
laws, Virginia was among the states that he scored as having a “detailed and explicit” replevin
law. 57 Two sections explicitly address the process for recovery, should the more common
negotiations with the party in possession of the record or records fail: section 42.1-89, titled
“Petition and court order for return of public records not in authorized possession,” and section

The Library of Virginia identifies eighteen categories of local record types found in the collections of localities,
among them: court records, election records, fiduciary records, land records, tax and fiscal records, and wills. See

42.1-90, titled “Seizure of public records not in authorized possession.” Both sections were
revised in 1975 and 1976, a period of activity in other states, like North Carolina, where similar
replevin statutes were being codified.
Section 42.1-89, firstly, defines the parties who have powers to petition the circuit courts
for the return of records. The Librarian of Virginia, who is the agency head of the Library of
Virginia, has authority under the statute, along with designated representatives of the Librarian,
like the State Archivist or Deputy Librarian. County clerks, the record keepers for the county,
and “any [other] public official who is the custodian of public records” are empowered by this
statute to petition the court for recovery if there are records of his or her county or agency in
private hands. 58 The court will expect that the petitioner can demonstrate that he or she is the
rightful custodian of the records and that he or she did not transfer the records or give
authorization to the party in possession of them.
Under section 42.1-89, these public officials can file a petition with the circuit court in
the county where the individual in possession of the records resides or the county where some or
all of the records are held. The section states, “The court shall order such public records be
delivered to the petitioner upon finding that the materials in issue are public records and that
such public records are in the possession of a person not authorized by the custodian of the
public records or by law to possess such public records.” This sentence actually describes a
series of activities, activities that may not be apparent to a non-legal professional who reads the
statute. Virginia’s Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia provides insight into what this process
involves for the petitioner (the public official), the respondent (the private party in possession of
the disputed records), and the court (the judge).
A “petition” is a complaint that is filed with the circuit court clerk in, according to section
58

Code of Virginia. § 42.1-89.

23

42.1-89, the county where the party in possession of the records or the records themselves
reside. 59 The clerk informs the party in possession of the records of the filed complaint and the
party’s right to file a response to the petition with the clerk’s office. 60 Before the trial
commences and court makes a finding on the issue of ownership, both the petitioner and the
respondent may “obtain discovery” of evidence through, for example, depositions and receipt of
documentation. 61 If the judge finds “the materials in issue are public records and that such public
records are in the possession of a person not authorized by the custodian of the public records or
by law to possess such public records,” this will occur only after both parties present evidence at
a hearing. 62
The challenge that public officials have in working with the confines of the VPRA is
that, like the North Carolina law, the statute is silent on the matter of Virginia records that are
outside of state borders. Section 42.1-90, however, does provide a path of action that the
Librarian of Virginia, a county clerk, or a designated public official may take if there is fear that
a record currently in the Commonwealth will escape through sale or some other means. Either at
the time of the petition filing or after, the public official can submit an ex parte request to have a
sheriff seize the records. 63 The judge will decide whether to grant the seizure “upon receipt of an
affidavit from the petitioner which alleges that the material at issue may be sold, secreted,
removed out of this Commonwealth … or that such property may be destroyed or materially
damaged or injured if permitted to remain out of the petitioner's possession.” 64 If the judge
orders the seizure, the court will not notify the party in possession of the records prior to their

seizure, presumably to ensure that the records are not subject to any of the risks outlined in the
affidavit. 65
A search for court opinions related to public records and ownership produces a small
number of cases that involved the court system in some capacity but that were ultimately settled
between parties. The earliest example of such a case involved a First Lady, Union soldier and a
financial mogul. In 1915, the Commonwealth of Virginia and Fairfax County successfully
recovered Martha Washington’s last will and testament. Wills are county records and statutory
requirements have, since the Colonial period, required clerks to permanently retain them. As a
resident of Mount Vernon in Fairfax County, Virginia, the First Lady’s will was housed in the
Fairfax County Courthouse from June 21, 1802 until 1862, when a Union soldier took custody of
it. The soldier’s daughter, in turn sold the will to finance mogul J. Pierpont Morgan, Sr. Upon
Morgan’s death, the Commonwealth learned that the record was part of his estate. When Fairfax
county officials were unsuccessful in securing the return of the will from the family, the General
Assembly of Virginia filed suit. Before the hearing commenced, however, J. Pierpont Morgan,
Jr. turned the record over to the state. It remains in the custody of the circuit court of Fairfax
County today. 66 This dissertation located two relevant disputes in which a judge’s opinion
resolved the matter of ownership of Virginia records: Howard J. Holton v. Samuel Yudkin (1977)
and Middlesex County et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store (1992). Both cases
focused on ownership of local records and both involved Louis H. Manarin, former State
Archivist of Virginia. One was a success for the government, the other simultaneously a win and
a loss. They are discussed in Chapter Two and Chapter Six

II. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE

This dissertation places the practice of replevin in the broader literature on property and
ownership. With this framework in mind, the literature review begins with a discussion of the
meaning of property and the concept of government takings. Given that the focus of this research
is the recovery of public records, corpus of literature that defines this category of documentation
is examined. Readers are oriented to the concept of replevin as it is understood and viewed by
the legal community, the archival community, and the collecting community. Because of the
inconsistency between the legal understanding of the term replevin and the archival community’s
use of the descriptor, the literature review identifies the traditional legal meaning of replevin and
subsequently turn its to the discussion that comes forth in the archival literature and the writings
by members of the collecting community. It is necessary to note that, for the purpose of this
review, both statute and case law are treated as literature. Both are published evidence of how the
courts and legislature have responded to the issue of ownership of public records. 67

A “case” in the legal field is both a term that generally describes a legal proceeding or action and the written
summary, court opinion, and order that can be accessed through legal databases like LexisNexis Academic.
67

26

II.A. PROPERTY AND OWNERSHIP
The corpus of literature on property is extensive and spans disciplines, with a particularly
substantial presence in the legal, political science, and philosophy fields. The meaning of
“property” is, as political scientist C.B. MacPherson suggests, a changeable construct that is
defined by societal forces. 68 For this reason, it is a term that MacPherson and many others
identify as having eluded a stable definition. Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, in his highly cited essay
“Some Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning,” observes that
individuals both within and outside the legal profession struggle to find consistent meaning in the
word “property,” though it is a word that is deeply embedded in everyday vocabulary. 69 Legal
scholar John Edward Cribbet suggests that it is simply not possible to resolve on one unified
definition to the term. He writes, “The question [of what is ‘property’] is unanswerable because
the meaning of the chameleon-like word property constantly changes in time and space.”
However, MacPherson identifies two distinct usages of the term. In common parlance, he
explains, property is viewed as synonymous with “things.” In the legal field, however, property
refers to “not things but rights, rights in or to things.” 70 Because this is not a study for a legal
publication, both the layman’s and the attorney’s usages of the term are employed in this
dissertation, with “property” describing both the object that is owned and the rights associated
with the ownership of the property.

An early understanding of property in the United States was based on the English legal
scholar William Blackstone’s writing. Blackstone conceived of property as a party’s “sole and
despotic dominion which one man claims and exercises over the external things of the world.” 71
Contemporary legal scholars cite how, by the nineteenth century, Blackstone’s understanding of
property was “outdated.” 72 Today, the “mainstream Anglo-American perception of property is
best understood as a ‘bundle of rights,’” an understanding that was greatly shaped by the work of
Wesley Hohfeld and A. M. Honoré. 73 Hohfeld, in his aforementioned essay, theorizes that
ownership is less about the relationship between a person and a thing and more about the rights
that the owner has over those of others in relation to that object. Nearly fifty years later, Honoré,
in his classic essay titled “Ownership,” uses the term “incidents” to describe the legal rights
associated with ownership.
Honoré outlines eleven incidents, including “the right to possess, the right to use, the
right to manage, the right to the income of the thing, [and] the right to the capital.” 74 Philosopher
Hugh Breakey, in his review of property theory literature, maintains that contemporary property
theorists more commonly adapt Honoré’s eleven incidents by approaching property as set of
three rights: the right to use the thing, the right to exclude others from the use of the thing, and
the right to manage and alienate the object. 75 While legal scholars such as J.E. Penner, Thomas
W. Merrill and Henry E. Smith have challenged the usefulness of interpreting property as a
bundle of rights, it remains the dominant paradigm for approaching the concept of property in

United States today. 76 The bundle of rights that are central to the legal use of the term are
relevant in building an understanding of what a rightful owner of a record, whether the owner is
a private party or the public, has the ability to do with the object. The bundle of rights that are
associated with ownership can be separated from one another and from the object itself. An
owner, for example, can lease his or her boat to another party to use for the afternoon. This
requires a formal transfer of the right; the owner must expressly grant this right to the party.
For J.E. Penner, there are two rights that are of particular importance to the idea of
property. The first is exclusivity, the ability of the owner to use property as he or she desires. 77
Penner explains that the exclusive right over the use of the property is closely tied to a second
right: the right to alienate property. He explains that alienability “includes the rights to abandon
[property] …, to share it, to license it to others (either exclusively or not), and to give it to others
in its entirely.” 78 This model for understanding property has relevant applications for this study.
A government archives that challenges an individual’s right to sell a public record on eBay is
questioning the legitimacy of the individual’s ownership of the record and the subsequent right to
alienate the record through a sale.
In a seminal paper in The American Economic Review, economist Harold Demsetz
advances a theory of property that is decidedly social in nature. The bundle of rights that is
associated with owning property is socially determined and, in the absence of society, the
enforceable claim over a thing would be absent of any meaning. He writes, “In the world of
Robinson Crusoe[,] property rights play no role. Property rights are an instrument of society and
derive their significance from the fact that they help a man form those expectations which he can

reasonably hold in his dealings with others. These expectations find expression in the laws,
customs, and mores of a society.” 79 Margaret Davies suggests that property serves as a lens into
a social order; there is much to learn, she proposes, from how a society chooses to use its
resources. 80 Gregory S. Alexander and Eduardo M. Peñalver suggest that Demsetz and Davies
are not alone in their focus on the social nature of property rights. At the heart of property theory,
the Alexander and Peñalver explain, is a “central preoccupation” with the relationship between
individuals and their communities. 81 The distinct categorical forms of property further support
the notion that property is about much more than individuals alone. Three property categories are
generally identified in the literature: common property, private property, and public property.
Most readers are likely familiar with the theoretical discussions concerning common
property, a category that M. Patricia Marchak characterizes as “things to which no one can make
a property claim and, ipso facto, no one can be excluded from access or use.” 82 Garrett Hardin
warned against the effects that self-interested individuals pose to common property in his
influential article The Tragedy of the Commons, published in Science in 1968. 83 Central to this
study on replevin of public records, however, is the differentiation between the latter two
property forms: private and public property. Richard A. Epstein defines private property as
representing “the sum of the goods that the individual gets to keep outside of the control of the
state.” 84 Private property as a property type has, as M. Patricia Marchak acknowledges, a long
theoretical history, with writings by such notable and familiar philosophers as John Locke,

Hegel, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Jeremy Bentham. Among the most oft-cited contributions is
Locke’s Second Treatise of Government. Locke expresses his belief that the right to hold
property is a natural right that all individuals possess, not one that is granted by the government.
It is through labor, in Locke’s philosophical interpretation of property, that an individual secures
ownership of an object. 85
While private property is characterized by the rights possessed by individuals to use and
exclude others from objects, MacPherson maintains that public, or state, property “consists of
rights which the state has not only created but has kept for itself or has taken over from private
individuals or corporations.” 86 Marchak suggests that there are two varieties of public property:
public property that the government can exercise the right to exclude from being accessed and
used by private individuals and public property that the government ensures can be equally
accessed and used by private individuals. 87 With these two varieties of state property in mind,
public records may be classified as objects that the state is committed to making indiscriminately
accessible to the general public.
In her 2003 monograph entitled The Idea of Property: Its Meaning and Power, Laura S.
Underkuffler, professor of law at Cornell University and formerly at Duke Law School,
identifies one historic source of tension in the division between private versus public property
rights. The government's ability to shape the regulation of property has often, since the era of the
Revolutionary War, "generated bitter rhetorical and political debate about the nature, extent, and
sanctity of claimed individual rights to private property." 88 Underkuffler explains that in the
modern-day United States, "private property systems have recently triumphed” over systems that

favor governmental sovereignty over property. She, however, usefully points to the nature of
regulation in relation to certain types of property, citing cultural property law as representative of
an area in which private ownership is not always privileged. 89 Protection and public ownership
of cultural property gained traction internationally in the latter half of the twentieth century, with
the development of the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the
Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property in 1970 and the
subsequent passage of domestic legislation sparking repatriation efforts and attempts to protect
and recover objects of cultural heritage. Like government archival repositories that recover
public records so that they remain accessible and preserved, national governments have passed
legislation that allows them to recover objects that are perceived to be of cultural significance to
the state.
As MacPherson and others have acknowledged, property is a complex concept. 90
Underkuffler describes a "visceral" and innate pull toward property ownership. It is this
connection to property, she argues, that sparks an emotional response when ownership is
threatened. 91 She draws upon the writings of legal scholar Kevin Gray, who observes that a
possessive concern for material goods is perceptible in children with their toys on playgrounds. 92
Law professor Margaret Jane Radin, in her seminal article “Property and Personhood,” speaks to
this notion but describes the import that individuals place on certain objects in their lives. She
writes, “Most people possess certain objects they feel are almost part of themselves. These
objects are closely bound up with the personhood because they are part of the way we constitute
ourselves as personal entities in the world…One may gauge the strength or significance of

someone’s relationship with an object by the kind of pain that would be occasioned by its
loss.” 93 The intimate connection to objects, coupled with Locke’s theory on the relationship
between labor and property, may provide insight into the responses to replevin from members of
the collecting community. These individuals may have an attachment to a record and believe that
their possession of it was the product of their labor. This mindset may contribute to their
objections to the government’s claims of ownership.
In reflecting on this innate urge to collect and the value that individuals place in certain
objects, it is not difficult to consider the emotional reaction that might occur when property is
lost or taken. Replevin cases may become controversial when the individual in possession of a
record views the government’s claim to ownership as illegitimate or when the record has
meaning and value to the owner. In the view of this collector, the government is not recovering
public property, but rather seeking custody of the collector’s private property, property that the
collector may view as a potential source of profit or notoriety. For the archives, the recovery of
public records may be characterized as “replevin” in that it is done to repossess the government’s
personal property that another party holds unlawfully. For the protesting collector, however, the
government’s claim may be more fittingly described as “a taking.”
As described above, the term “takings” is most commonly associated with eminent
domain. Through the power of eminent domain, the government has the authority to take private
property if the property will be converted for public use and the holder is compensated for the
taking. 94 Eminent domain generally refers to the seizure of real property, or land, but Daniel J.
Hurtado explains that government takings do not only take on the form of direct appropriation of
physical property. The Supreme Court has decided that government regulations that strip an

owner of the ability to use his or her property in an economically viable way are a taking. 95 Of
particular relevance to this study, however, are the implications of eminent domain for forms of
property other than land. Frank L. Childs and others, however, point to case precedent that reveal
that the government can exercise eminent domain to acquire other forms of property, including
“chattels,” or movable articles of personal property. 96 Childs writes, “All kinds of property and
every variety and degree of interest therein may be taken under the power of eminent domain;
and while it most often is exercised in acquiring real property it is not restricted thereto, but
personal property…can be taken thereunder.” 97 Epstein suggests that one possible impetus for
the inclusion of the takings clause was to protect chattels, such as food and artillery, from being
appropriated by government troops. 98 With the understanding that the concept of government
takings is not solely tied to real property, eminent domain becomes relevant when considering
the government’s recovery of public records and the collecting community’s perception of these
actions.
A collector who questions the public nature of a record and who is not compensated for
the transfer of custody may view the government as in violation of the Fifth Amendment. For
these individuals, they may perceive the government’s actions as being akin to a government
takings, with their personal property removed from their custody to satisfy a public use. The
relationship between eminent domain and replevin in the archival field is one that Elizabeth H.
Dow of the Louisiana State University’s School of Library and Information Science program

makes a brief reference to in her recently published monograph on the issues surrounding the
ownership of public records. She writes, “Collectors argue that when the state demands the
return of a document, the state has exercised eminent domain but without compensation, making
it theft. Archivists argue that they are not stealing someone else’ property – merely reclaiming
their own.” 99 Because of eminent domain’s link to the Fifth Amendment, this dissertation
prefers to characterize a dissenting view of the replevin practice as “unconstitutional” rather than
an act of theft. In either case, however, a consideration of the property literature on takings is
relevant in approaching the data collection and analysis. This dissertation examines whether
government archives appear mindful of mitigating a negative association between the recovery
of public records and unconstitutional takings through the information that is disseminated to the
public regarding public records, interviews with individuals involved in replevin efforts, and
documentation that provides insight into the negotiations with the private parties in possession of
public records.

II.B. THE NATURE OF PUBLIC RECORDS
In an American Archivist article published in 1960, Oliver W. Holmes highlights a self-evident,
but important, distinction regarding the nature of records: records may be classified as either
“public” or “private.” Despite statutory definitions of “public records,” Holmes argues that this
dichotomy is often a hazy one. This ambiguity has direct implications for the replevin of public
records. 100 He explains, “In connection with efforts to replevin public records that somehow
have escaped from public custody, uncertainty exists on both sides because of conflicting views

99

Holmes, “ ‘Public Records,’ ” 4.

100

35

and definitions of public records.” 101 Like Holmes, archivist Harold T. Pinkett acknowledges
that a “public record” has been defined in inconsistent ways. Pinkett, however, identifies a thread
that links varying interpretations of the term. Public records may have varying physical
characteristics and formats, but are either created or received by a government office as part of a
government transaction. 102
Law enters the archival field through statutes and court decisions. A literature review
about replevin of public records must necessarily examine relevant instances of both. Statutes on
a federal and state level define the elements of a public record. Importantly, technology has
broadened the meaning of “public record.” While Holmes, writing in 1960, maintained that
“few” states had legislation relating to public records, attorney Roger A. Nowadzky’s analysis of
public records statutes reveals that the 1966 passage of the Federal Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) spurred open records laws on a state level, which, in turn, codified definitions of public
records. 103 Nowadzky remarks that a notable development in more recent definitions of “public
record” is the explicit inclusion of computerized information produced during the course of a
government transaction as a public record. 104
In understanding the nature of public records that are deemed archival, it is useful to
assess what record types government archivists characterize as outside the boundaries of the
archival collections they oversee. Elizabeth H. Dow references comments made by David Haury,
state archivist of Pennsylvania, at a 2009 meeting of the Manuscript Society’s board of trustees.
He explained that records that are created with the intention for distribution to individuals or
organizations are not archival. For example, licenses, along with letters or materials that a

government official sends to a private party, would not be deemed archival. Instead, “archival
records include records documenting the granting of licenses, in-coming letters, indexes to
deeds, records of commissions granted, and other documents created by a government body and
intended for its own keeping.” 105 The exclusions are important in understanding the nature of
replevin. As Dow goes on to explain, NARA does not consider any record that the government
creates with the intent of disseminating it to a private party to be a federal record. 106 Because
they are not archival, these outgoing records would, consequently, not be subject to a replevin
action.
There is a unique characteristic of public records that is the root behind government
archives' replevin activities. Public records are often “inalienable” by law, a characteristic that
Dutch archival scholar Eric Ketelaar describes in a 1985 UNESCO RAMP study. 107 Ketelaar
explains, “Inalienability may be defined as the quality of public archives deriving from their
relationship to the sovereignty of a state or the legal authority of any other body, which prevents
their removal or abandonment.” 108 Because of the inalienability of public records, there is no
statute of limitations that restricts when a government may seek replevin. 109 Richard PearceMoses describes this absence of a statute of limitations as “imprescriptibility,” a term that means
public records “remain permanently subject to replevin because they are inalienable public
property.” 110 Douglas Cox contributes to this discussion of archival inalienability and its

relationship to replevin, explaining that, under many governments, it is necessary to obtain
explicit permission to transfer custody of a public record. 111
Moreover, the disposal of public records must occur in adherence to federal and state
statutes. However, the literature does indicate that there is a loophole that allows for the private
ownership of public records. In his law review article “A Resolution of Title to WPA Prints,”
Tobin A. Sparling outlines the complex issues surrounding the ownership of prints created by
employees of the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Sparling
explains that, following the disbandment of the WPA in 1943, many of prints and the
recordkeeping for the Federal Art Project were in a state of neglect. 112 He writes that it was
“rumored that many of the prints were simply going to be destroyed. In the intervening years,
reports of finding WPA prints in derelict federal buildings, wastebaskets, and trash piles have not
been uncommon.” 113 In spite of this, at the time of his writing in 1983, Sparling indicates that the
federal government was making a concerted effort to recover the WPA prints and demonstrated a
renewed interest in the works of art. 114 The question of whether the government abandoned the
WPA prints has therefore become an issue in the cases of replevin of the works of art. If the
government did indeed throw out the WPA prints, this act of abandonment could be used as
evidence to prove that the state relinquished its title. 115 Sparling’s discussion of the case of the
WPA prints introduces the idea that if a private individual is able to prove that the state
abandoned the record and thus abandoned the title, he or she may be able to use this evidence to
counter a replevin action.

There is a clear contrast between the ownership of the tangible public records and the
ownership of the intellectual rights to this property. While the federal government is the legal
owner of the physical records, federal records are public domain works under the Copyright Act
of 1976. Section 105 of the law is brief in its reference in what it refers to as “United States
Government works,” but clearly states that the federal government is unable to hold copyright to
these works. This means that while a private individual may not be able to own a record, he or
she is able to reproduce, distribute, perform, and display the record, as well as create derivative
works from it.

II.C. REPLEVIN AS A LEGAL CONCEPT
The legal system in the United States is that of the common law tradition, which originated in the
medieval courts of England, and is rooted in the principle of stare decisis. While the system of
civil law in countries such as France and Germany firmly adheres to codified statute, common
law, as Lawrence M. Friedman describes it, is “judge-made law – molded, refined, examined,
and changed in the crucible of actual decision, and handed down from generation to generation
in the form of reported cases.” 116 Of course, legislative statutes exist and are central to the legal
system in the United States. The common law tradition, however, places court precedent in a role
of fundamental importance to the judicial system.
Replevin is a common law writ and, in medieval England, the writ system was the basis
of the legal system. As George Spence explains, “no action in the King’s Courts could be
commenced without a writ,” which he goes on to define as a:
mandate from the King, under the great seal, addressed to the sheriff
116

39

of the county in which the cause of action arose or where the defendant
resided, commanding him to cause the party complained of to appear
in the King’s Court at a certain day, to answer the complaint. 117
In his account of the development of common law, historian Arthur R. Hogue describes the
significance of the “writ system” in the Middle Ages. In the centuries before the existence of
parliamentary legislation, Arthur R. Hogue remarks that judges would “find the common law” in
writs, the number of which grew at a rapid rate in the thirteenth century. 118 While there were
thirty-nine writs in 1189, they numbered more than four hundred a century later, with the writ of
replevin among them. 119
Theodore F. T. Plunkett, a British historian of law, chronicles the evolution of the
common law system in his A Concise History of the Common Law, a text first printed in 1929.
Plunkett’s discussion of the writ of replevin provides insight into the early use of the legal action.
In his illustration of the use of the action of replevin in the thirteenth century, Plunkett explains
that replevin was most commonly employed to settle a property disagreement between a tenant
and his feudal lord. If a lord “distrained,” or seized, property in order to enforce rental fees or the
fulfillment of services to be provided by the tenant, a tenant who disputes the obligation to
provide these services may seek the recovery of the property through a writ of replevin. The
tenant would post a bond for the recovery of the property by the sheriff and repossess the
property until court would determine which party should have custody of it. According to
Plunkett, the lord would respond to the action by either denying the seizure of the property or,
more often, by justifying the seizure by identifying the rent or services that the tenant is
obligated to provide. If the lord was successful in making his case, the court would decide that

the property should be returned to the lord. 120 Replevin, in the English courts of the thirteenth
century, was more commonly used to determine the legality of a property seizure than to settle a
dispute in which two parties claim ownership of the same property. 121
In a paper written for a presentation at the American Library Association’s 1978
conference, James E. O’Neill, former deputy archivist of the United States, explains that the
contemporary understanding of replevin is “the recovery of alienated personal property through a
legal proceeding, usually modern rules of civil procedure rather than writ.” 122 The Pennsylvania
Rules of Civil Procedure (Pa. R.C.P.), which can be viewed as representative of state civil
procedure, provides insight into these modern day rules that guide a replevin action. Pa. R.C.P.
section 1073 specifies that the plaintiff, the party who seeks the recovery of personal property,
initiates the replevin action with the filing of a complaint, or lawsuit, with the prothonotary. 123 In
doing so, the plaintiff must include the description and value of the property to be seized, the
location of the property at the time of filing, and the facts behind the plaintiff’s claim. 124 At this
time, the plaintiff may decide to request a writ of seizure from the court. This may be done even
before the defendant receives notice of the complaint. 125 If the court agrees to grant the writ of
seizure, the sheriff will seize the property from the defendant before a judgment is rendered on
the complaint. This is not without price to the plaintiff. The court requires a bond to be paid by
the plaintiff to seize the property before trial; under Pennsylvania’s Rules of Civil Procedure, the
plaintiff’s bond will be double the value of the property that is seized. 126 In their article for The

Florida Bar Journal, attorneys Patrick C. Barthet and Daniel Morman explain that a writ of
seizure serves as a “vehicle to obtain possession [of personal property] on an expedited basis.” 127
For parties that do not want to wait until the trial to regain physical custody of their property,
replevin may be a desirable path to take.
It is important to note that replevin “permits the owner to follow and reclaim the property
at any point in the chain of possession.” 128 This means that if, for example, a record is stolen and
sold to a bona fide purchaser, the original owner may still seek the recovery of the property. It is
immaterial that the current possessor did not knowingly obtain stolen property; this party does
not have good title to the object in question. 129 The literature reveals other characteristics of
public records that impact replevin. In the 1868 case of City of New York v. Lent, which focused
on the ownership of a letter written by George Washington, the court found that there could be
no bona vide purchaser of a public record. William S. Price, Jr., in his article on the notable
replevin case of State of North Carolina v. B.C. West Jr., explains that this concept led to the
court’s decision that the state of North Carolina should have custody of the records that were in
question in this dispute.130 Because of this, even an individual who exercises due diligence and
purchases a public record in good faith does not have rightful ownership.
Because it is a common law remedy, both the federal and state governments can employ
replevin to regain custody of public records. In State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr., a court
decision in which the government was the successful party, the state’s case “turned on common
law, not statute.” 131 Some states, however, have codified the common law remedy in their

statutes and have, even, specifically legislated for replevin of public records. The Corpus Juris
Secundum, an encyclopedic resource for legal professionals, highlights the statutory nature of
replevin actions. It reads, “It has been said that the action of replevin is not, strictly speaking, a
common-law action, but it is now based on applicable statutes.” 132 While North Carolina was
victorious in the litigation against B.C. West, Jr., the state does not rely solely on its case law
precedent for its replevin efforts; there is a 1975 statute that acts as another form of leverage for
North Carolina. For states with statutes of replevin that relate to public records, Ernst Posner
explains that “replevin authority is normally vested in the attorney general.” 133
Perhaps the most significant contribution in understanding state law as it pertains to
replevin of public records is George W. Bain’s content analysis of public records statutes.
Through his 1983 study, Bain addressed, among other things, “what states have the best
provisions for replevin of public records out of public custody.” 134 Bain uses a scoring system to
indicate the level of comprehensiveness of the state law, with a “0” indicating “no mention” to a
“3” indicating “detailed and explicit coverage.” 135 In the discussion of his study, Bain cites
Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Virginia as states with particularly notable
legislation dealing with replevin and public records. 136 A review of Bain’s findings reveals that
twenty-seven states had “no mention” of replevin of public records in state legislation. 137 There
have not been updates to Bain’s findings in the thirty years since its publication, but this is a
separate study from the one presented here. A preliminary exploration of the statutes reveals,
however, that there have been developments in the area of replevin legislation. For example,

Tennessee and California, two states that were among those with no mention of replevin in the
public records statutes in 1983, have statutes that would be scored a “3” on Bain’s scale in
2012. 138
There have been no changes in the replevin statutes in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and
Virginia since Bain’s study. North Carolina’s statute continues to be among the states with
particularly “detailed and explicit coverage” of replevin of public records. Virginia, also rated a
"3" by Bain, has statutory authority, but, as the dissertation reveals, employs it less often than its
neighbor to the south. Pennsylvania remains among those states without a public records replevin
statute. Dow addresses how archives in states with weak replevin statutes or states where the
Attorney General’s office has little interest in recovering public records may seek the transfer of
a copy as a substitute to the original. 139 This dissertation considers whether any of the states
studied have pursued this alternate course, one that would depart very distinctively from the legal
understanding of replevin.

II.D. REPLEVIN AS A CONCEPT IN THE ARCHIVAL FIELD
An 1890 publication entitled A Practical Treatise on the Law of Replevin as Administered by the
Courts of the United States provides an early reference to the relationship between the common
remedy of replevin and archival materials. John E. Cobbey comments on the attempted use of
replevin to gain ownership of public documents under the care of a public official. Cobbey
emphasizes that public records are the property of the United States government and maintains,
“It will not lie to remove public records or documents from a public office. Such instruments are

in the custody of the sovereign power, and the writ, if issued for their seizure, will be quashed
when the facts appear to the court and the papers returned.” 140 This same idea is echoed by H.W.
Wells in his 1907 publication, A Treatise on the Law of Replevin as Administered in the Courts
of the United States and England. 141
A review of literature related to archival history in the United States reveals that efforts to
recover public records in fact have their origins in the early-nineteenth century. While a loose
application of the term “replevin,” the practices of the nineteenth-century historical societies,
organizations that Richard J. Cox characterizes as the predecessors to government archives,
adopted the charge of collecting public records that were in the possession of private parties and,
even, foreign repositories. 142 While Bickford attributes the historical societies’ efforts to collect
these materials to their concern that they would otherwise be “lost,” Cox describes these
collecting practices as, in reality, damaging in that the public records were separated from their
context as organizational records. 143 Nicholas Falco addresses these early 19th century state
efforts to “seek pertinent records located in foreign archives,” revealing that replevin of pubic
records, in this looser sense, can traverse the borders of the United States. 144 He highlights the
New York Historical Society’s 1839 petition to the New York state government and the
subsequent efforts of the latter party to regain custody of state records in Great Britain, France,
and the Netherlands. Interestingly, Falco’s account of the government-sponsored mission, carried
out by a man named John Romeyn Brodhead, reveals that Brodhead negotiated for the

original records themselves. 145
As private repositories, the historical societies’ role as collectors of public records would
be challenged in the close of the nineteenth century. 146 Bickford cites one case in which the
Massachusetts state government requested the return of materials that had been previously given
to the Massachusetts Historical Society in which had been a government-sanctioned “deposit.”
He describes this instance of replevin as resulting in “a long and difficult controversy,” but one
that ultimately concluded with the determination that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had
the legal title to the materials. 147 The development of government archives would, Bickford
explains, create a “clear division of labor” in the archival field, with government archives
collecting public records and private repositories collecting private papers. 148
The literature suggests that replevin was a topic of some interest in the American archival
field at the time of the establishment of NARA and in the early years of the Society of American
Archivists’ existence. In a 1939 American Archivist article entitled “Character and Extent of
Fugitive Archival Material,” NARA’s Randolph G. Adams speaks to the challenges that
repositories face in recovering archival materials that have either strayed from the archives or
that failed to reach the archives. 149
Like NARA, SAA’s leadership was thinking about replevin and alienated records in the
late 1930s. SAA collaborated with the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State
Laws (NCCUSL) at this time in an effort to draft and put forth a uniform state law on public
records. In his 1938 presidential address, SAA president Albert Ray Newsome cited a need for

uniformity in archival state legislation. The focus of Newsome’s speech is public records; he
stresses that there is a need for an accepted definition of public record and codification of the
materials to be used during creation. 150 Pertinent to this literature review is Newsome’s
discussion of laws in place concerning abuses against public archives. He notes that while many
states have regulations in place concerning “altering, defacing, mutilating, removing, stealing,
falsifying, and destroying” public records, there should be a general law in place that addresses
all potential abuses. 151 There is no evidence that suggests that this discussion gained much
traction, however, and the inconsistency in statutory law in this area persists.
While the dialogue about SAA’s collaboration with NCCUSL ebbed soon after it began,
there was another mention of replevin in the archival field in 1945. In Margaret Cross Norton’s
presidential address at SAA’s annual meeting, she surveyed the legal concerns that faced the
profession, including replevin of public records. Norton offers particular insight into the issue of
alienated public records through her discussion of the role that government officials played in
their disappearance at the time. Norton explains that while a replevin action is “useful in the
recovery of deliberate thefts from the archives,” it is rarely “successfully invoked in the case of
records taken by officials going out of office.” Norton cites this reality as the most common way
that government records went missing during the WWII period. Her brief discussion of replevin
underscores a theme that is a common thread in the literature: using replevin to retrieve custody
of a record can be wrought with complications, regardless of how or why it disappeared.
Ownership is not always readily apparent. 152
Peterson and Peterson’s Archives and Manuscripts: Law, a text published by SAA in
1985, provides a useful overview of replevin as it is understood in the archival field and notable

court decisions. Perhaps the most notable contribution of Peterson and Peterson’s text is the
acknowledgment that the members of the archival community have appropriated the term and
employ it in ways that stray from the technical legal meaning of the term. They suggest that the
archival use of the term in fact conflates replevin with other common law remedies that relate to
the recovery of personal property, namely with “detinue” and “trover.” Detinue is, as the authors
explain, a remedy to recover property that another party received lawfully but has improperly
detained. Peterson and Peterson offer an illustration of this: if an archives loaned an item from its
collection to another party and the borrower does not return it as was agreed upon, the lending
archives may seek an action of detinue. Trover describes an action to recovery the value of
property that is unlawfully held by another party, rather than the property itself. One comment
from Peterson and Peterson is particularly worthy of quoting here, as it captures the
aforementioned statutory nature of replevin and emphasizes that the archival and legal meaning
of replevin are often inconsistent with one another. They write,
All states have some legal method for the recovery of personal
property. Most states (and the United States) have replaced these
common law remedies with some form of statutory ones. All of
these remedies, whether common law or statutory, whether replevin,
detinue, or trover, have come to be called replevin by archivists,
and for the purposes of this discussion will be referred to as such
even though the term is not technically correct. 153
Peterson and Peterson’s section on replevin is notable in a second way. The authors outline a set
of criteria that a government archives may use to determine whether to pursue a replevin action.
First, they advise archives to seek the recovery of any and all items that were stolen from the
repository and that are now identified as in the custody of another party. Second, Peterson and
Peterson stress that archives should “always” attempt to recover “significant documents” that are

153

Peterson and Peterson, Archives and Manuscripts: Law, 91.

48

public in nature and that are outside of the custody of the archives. 154 A third point of criteria is
particularly interesting in that it reflects an assurance made by Wayne C. Grover, former
Archivist of the United States, who maintained, “ ‘No one at the National Archives has any
inclination or intention whatsoever to gain physical possession of those historical documents in
the possession of such responsible institutions as the great university libraries and the widely
respected historical societies.’ ” 155 Peterson and Peterson suggest that if a public record is in the
custody of another repository and is accessible to the public, the government archives should
consider accepting a copy in place of an original. This is provided that the repository in
possession of the record can assure that the record will continue to be properly cared for and
available to researchers. Finally, Peterson and Peterson recommend that public records that are in
private custody and unavailable to researchers should be made accessible either through the
recovery of an original or the obtainment of a copy. 156 This dissertation unveils whether state
archives subscribe to these suggested guidelines when determining whether to pursue a replevin
action and when reaching agreements with individuals outside of court.
Two more recent monographs have informed the archival community of the topic of
replevin. While it is a succinct overview of replevin, Behrnd-Klodt’s chapter in her Navigating
Legal Issues in Archives text is, along with Peterson and Peterson’s work, among the most
valuable discussions on replevin in the archival literature. Behrnd-Klodt, an attorney and
archivist, offers a description of the procedure for recovering personal property through replevin
that is more rooted in a legal understanding of the remedy. In what is her most beneficial
contribution to the sparse scholarship of replevin in the archival field, Behrnd-Klodt provides an
analysis of the few court decisions that have involved the disputed ownership of public

records. 157 Her work, however, does not broach the nature of settlements that are reached
between parties without the court’s intervention, a gap that this dissertation will seek to fill.
Dow’s Archivists, Collectors, Dealers, and Replevin, the second of recent monographs,
overviews some public records laws in place and the small number of court cases. The most
notable contribution of Dow’s 2012 publication, however, is her acknowledgement that replevin
has historically been a divisive issue between government archivists and collectors and her
suggestion that the variances in the legal environment from state to state can have a bearing on
the replevin process.
The term “replevin” is present in court decisions regarding the ownership of objects of
cultural property that were displaced during wartime and improperly held by another party. 158
However, when these cases involve an international exchange of cultural property, they are more
commonly described as instances of “repatriation.” In reviewing the archival literature, there are
occurrences in which the legal term “replevin” is used to describe efforts to retrieve records that
were seized during war and that are in the custody of an individual or institution outside of the
United States. This indicates that individuals in the archival community use the term to describe
the general process of recovering materials that are alienated, even if it involves an international
exchange. For example, Trudy Huskamp Peterson comments on “replevin” in her essay
“Archives in Service to the State,” focusing upon the conflict’s potential impact to archival
repositories. She writes, “Archivists have focused on the legal question of replevin: how to return

or regain (or both) the records armies have seized.” 159 In applying the term “replevin” to cases in
which there is an international exchange of property, Peterson is essentially using the term
“replevin” to describe the process in which “repatriation” is achieved.

II.E. REPLEVIN OF PUBLIC RECORDS IN COURT
There are, as Behrnd-Klodt notes “relatively few cases” involving replevin of public records that
have reached the courts. 160 This review identifies the small number of decisions that emerge
from a review of the archival literature, but builds on those that Behrnd-Klodt, Peterson and
Peterson, and Dow cite by reaching further into case law. 161 The review of the cases is organized
chronologically and reveals a mixed scorecard of victories and losses in the courtroom for
government archives.
The archival literature suggests that the movement of records during wars fought in the
United States can lead to attempted or successful replevin actions. Randolph G. Adams discusses
one such case that reached the courts involving a letter of discharge written by General George
Washington to the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry in 1777. Following the Revolutionary
War, the letter was held in the custody of Samuel Morris, Captain of the troop. 162 In an 1823
report on the troop’s archives, the military group acknowledged that the letter and a silver case
bearing Washington’s likeness were in the possession of the Morris family and asserted that the

items should remain in the family’s custody. 163 Luke W. Morris, son of Samuel Morris,
responded to the troop’s statement regarding the family’s ownership of the letter by giving the
group a facsimile of the item, a gift that representatives of the troop gratefully accepted. 164 The
troop seemingly changed its mind later in the 1860s when it brought suit against the Morris
family for the return of the letter. The judge ruled that, given the troop’s 1823 report in which it
recognized the Morris family’s ownership, the letter would remain with its current possessor. 165
Adams’s discussion of the case involving Morris and the Washington letter is revealing in
demonstrating the aforementioned notion of abandonment of title. In this case, the military unit,
while arguably once the rightful owner of the letter, alienated and transferred its rights to the
Morris family in 1823.
The 1860s saw another replevin case involving a letter written by George Washington.
The earliest case that is cited by Behnrd-Klodt, Peterson and Peterson, and Samuel R. Clawson is
Mayor of the City of New York v. Lent, an 1868 case that focused on the ownership of a letter
written by George Washington. The case was rooted in a dispute as to whether the letter was
indeed a “public record,” underscoring the ambiguity that Holmes and Pickett discuss in their
aforementioned publications. 166 The 1785 letter from Washington was addressed to the mayor,
recorder, and aldermen of New York City and was in response to an honor that the City Council
bestowed upon him. 167

Oliver Lorenzo Barbour describes the circumstances surrounding the lawsuit in an 1868
report of contemporary cases in the Supreme Court of the State of New York. When a collector
by the name of John Allan passed away in 1863, his library was auctioned and sold to DeWitt C.
Lent. Barbour reported that it was unclear how and when the letter came into Allan’s possession.
Upon learning of the letter, the City of New York sued Lent for its return, claiming it to be a
public record. The courts ultimately found in favor of the City of New York, the plaintiff in the
case, determining that:
“[The] letter was a peculiar and particular species of property;
and that its style, address, and responsive character to a legislative
act, should of itself be regarded as having imparted notice to all,
that from the moment of its reception and sending it became the
property of the corporation to whom it was addressed.” 168
Peterson and Peterson explain that the court’s finding was that Lent could not be a bona fide
purchaser because the characteristics and content of the letter “gave notice at all times that the
letter was property of the city.” 169 Like the case above, there are larger lessons to draw from the
court’s decision. A potential purchaser assumes a level of burden in identifying a public record
or may, if the purchase is made, be subject to a replevin action. Lent was unable to claim that he
had legitimate ownership of the letter despite purchasing it through an auction. The court found
that there was enough evidence in the content and structure of the letter that should have
informed Lent that it was the property of the city government of New York.
One of the most frequently referenced cases involving replevin of public records is
United States of America v. First Trust Company of Saint Paul, a 1958 case argued in the United
States Court of Appeals Eighth Circuit. 170 Peterson and Peterson and Behrnd-Klodt provide a

the litigation was a series of documents written by William Clark, co-leader of the Lewis and
Clark Expedition. Peterson and Peterson explain that the letters were discovered in a desk in the
home of the late Mrs. Sophia V.H. Foster and were obtained by her father, General John Henry
Hammond. When Foster’s heirs gave the documents to the Minnesota Historical Society, the
federal government intervened, seeking replevin of the records. 171 As both Peterson and Peterson
and Behrnd-Klodt indicate, the underlying question put forth by the case was whether Clark, as a
government employee, created these documents as personal notes or an official record as the
Expedition. The court found that the federal government did not successfully demonstrate that
these were public records and, instead, determined that they were Clark’s private writings. The
federal government failed to recover the Clark papers. 172
Two articles from the 1950s trace the circumstances leading up to the United States
government’s action and provide insight into the opinions about the case generally held in the
archival community. The rationale of the federal government, the plaintiff in the case, is best
represented in Robert H. Bahmer’s “The Case of the Clark Papers.” Bahmer, the Assistant
Archivist of the United States, first presented his view on the dispute during a 1955 meeting of
the Society of American Archivists and published his statement in a 1956 article. 173 At the time
of his publication, the government’s lawsuit was pending and would be decided two years later
by the trial and appeals court. Bahmer explains that NARA was unable to locate evidence that
demonstrated the Clark papers had left the federal government’s possession through proper
procedure. Consequently, Bahmer relates that NARA “had no choice, once the issue of title was

raised, but to recommend intervention.” 174 Although Bahmer acknowledges that other
institutions are capable of preserving the Clark papers, he maintains that the NARA has a legal
duty to care for public records of lasting value and to make these records accessible. 175 In doing
so, Bahmer frames the government’s decision to engage in legal action as obligatory.
In the second article, Julian P. Boyd of Princeton University reacts to the court’s decision
concerning the Clark papers shortly after it was made. 176 Boyd is critical of the court’s decision
that the papers are private documents and emphasizes his belief that they were the product of
Clark’s employ by the United States government. He writes, “Entrapped by its own faulty logic
and misuse of history, the court pursued its object with Olympian intransigence. The pocket
journals were private.” 177 Boyd’s emotional reaction provides insight into what may have been a
shared sentiment among other archivists.
Another replevin case surfaced in the 1960s, one that involved a series of papers
pertaining to Spanish and Mexican governance of New Mexico. The papers, dating from 1697
and 1846, were in the possession of Kenneth D. Sender, who first entered into legal proceedings
concerning the ownership of the records with the state of New Mexico. In February 1961, New
Mexico’s State Records Administrator, the chief party responsible for the implementation of
public records statutes in the state, initiated a replevin action against Sender, claiming possession
of the historical records. Because New Mexico’s code requires that a plaintiff file within two
years, when the State Records Administrator failed to do so and, in April 1963, the Supreme
Court of New Mexico dismissed the state’s replevin action. 178 The state was subject to the statute
of limitations in this case.

Sender’s success in New Mexico, however, did not bring about a conclusion to the
disputes surrounding the ownership of the papers. In late 1967, the United States District Court
for the Western District of Missouri heard the case of United States of America v. Kenneth D.
Sender, in which the federal government laid claim to the same set of papers. There is an absence
of any significant discussion of the case in the archival literature, but Paul V. Lutz of the
Manuscripts Society, an organization of private autograph and manuscript collectors, published a
piece on the trial and court decision in Manuscripts. He explains that the federal government
argued that the records were public documents and should have been transferred to the custody
of the United States after its victory in the Mexican-American War. 179 The presiding judge
instructed the jury members that, in order to find in favor of the plaintiff, they would have to
agree that the records are public in nature and that they were in the New Mexico territory at the
time of the American conquest. The jury found in favor of the defendant, a verdict that Lutz,
with bias creeping into his piece, imagined “should deter further [government] actions along
these lines.” 180
Two decades later, however, North Carolina was successful in the case of State of North
Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. In the 1976 case, North Carolina sought the return of two bills of
indictment signed in 1767 and 1768 by William Hooper, attorney for the King of England and an
eventual signer of the Declaration of Independence for North Carolina. Peterson and Peterson,
Behrnd-Klodt, Dow, and others described the circumstances that surrounded the case. The State
Supreme Court ruled in favor of North Carolina and offered what William S. Price, Jr., formerly
of the State Archives of North Carolina, describes as “an intriguing analysis.” 181 As BehrndKlodt explains it, the court found that the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the

Revolutionary War, transferred ownership of public records from the Kingdom of Great Britain
to the colonies. The bills of indictment were the property of the state of North Carolina as a
result. 182 This case and its implications for North Carolina’s replevin program will be examined
in the dissertation. It is one of a small number of case law precedents in which the government
was successful in recovering alienated materials.
There are two cases heard in a Virginia court that relates to replevin. In the first, Howard
J. Holton, Alexandria’s Director of Finance, filed a motion in the Circuit Court of Alexandria for
the return of a “collection assignment receipt book maintained by the Clerk and Auditor of the
[Alexandria] City Council during the period 1814-1862.” 183 The defense argued that the City of
Alexandria discarded the book in 1957 at which time it was gifted to a private book company
and, subsequently, acquired by the defendant. Such a gift would invalidate the title the city once
held. The city objected to the defense’s narrative, but, as the Judge pointed out, the petitioner
was “unable to account for the whereabouts of the book prior to the time that it come into the
hands of the defendant’s consignor.” 184
Three findings led to Judge Wiley B. Wright, Jr.’s order for the book to be returned to the
custody of the City of Alexandria. First, Judge Wright found that the book was indeed a public
record under the Virginia Code section 42.1-77. Second, Wright’s interpretation of the evidence
led to his determination that “the book was neither abandoned nor given away by the city.”

It appears that there was inactivity in this area in the 1980s; this literature review located
no cases that were tried in state or federal court on matters relating to the ownership of public
records. In 1992, another case was heard in Virginia, this time in the Circuit Court of the City of
Williamsburg and James City County, Virginia. In Middlesex et al. v. Jack Hamilton d/b/a/
Hamilton’s Book Store. 186 Hamilton, the owner of Hamilton’s Book Store in Williamsburg,
purchased the eighty-one records that were in question and contracted his friends at Middlesex
County’s library about his acquisition. News of the acquisition spread from there. On February
11, 1991, Virginia’s State Archivist and a Middlesex County administrator met with Hamilton to
view the purchased records and, on the same day, the county sheriff seized the records.
In Middlesex County et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store, the county and
the Librarian of Virginia petitioned for the ex parte seizure of the records under section 42.1-90
of the Public Records Law and for the return of the public records to the government under
section 42.1-89 of the statute. Hamilton challenged the constitutionality of the seizure and the
statute that allowed for it, but the court did not agree with his position. Having decided this, the
judge was charged with identifying whether the records were indeed public in nature as the
government officials argued. Interestingly, the judge applied a definition of “public record” that
was used in the 1874 case of Coleman v. Commonwealth, rather than the definition codified in
the Virginia Public Records Act. 187 The court did so upon determining that the Virginia statutory
definition of “public record” is broader than the common law definition, as established in
Coleman v. Commonwealth. The result of his application of the definition was the dispersal of
Howard J. Holtan v. Samuel Yudkin (Cir. Ct. of the City of Alexandria 1977).
“d/b/a” is an acronym for “doing business as.”
187
Coleman v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 865, 875 (1874). In Coleman v. Commonwealth, a public record
was defined as “a written memorial made by a public officer authorized by law to perform that function and
intended to serve as evidence of something written, said or done.”

some of the records to the government and some to Hamilton. 188 This case and its implications
for contemporary replevin activities in Virginia are discussed in further detail in Chapter Six.
In the opening decade of the 21st century, disputes surrounding the title to public records
again entered the courtroom. In the United States v. Ralph McElvenny, The John F. Kennedy
Museum Foundation, the government sought the recovery of a map of Cuba that was annotated
by President John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis and papers also annotated by the
President concerning the enrollment of civil rights figure James Meredith at the University of
Mississippi.189 Following Kennedy’s assassination, the trustees and executors of the estate
created a deed that donated to the United States what was described as “ ‘papers, documents,
historical materials, mementos, objects of art, and other memorabilia.’ ” 190 These materials were
to be deposited in the John F. Kennedy Library.
A brief interlude regarding presidential papers and ownership thereof is necessary for
understanding this particular case. Behrnd-Klodt explains that until Congress’s passage of the
Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA) in 1974, U.S. presidents
viewed the papers from their time in office to be their own property. 191 As a result, presidents
often took their papers with them when they left the White House and bequeathed them to heirs.
Congress secured some of these papers by raising funds for their purchase. 192 Legal scholars
have explored the issue of ownership of presidential records in law review journal articles. In his
Minnesota Law Review article, “Presidents and their Papers,” Carl McGowan cites a quote from
President Grover Cleveland that very aptly illustrates the position held by many presidents. In
Middlesex County et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store, 28 Va. Cir. 283 (Cir. Ct. of City of

reply to a Senate request for a file, Cleveland maintained, “‘I regard the papers and documents
withheld and addressed to me or intended for my use and action purely unofficial and private
…if I saw fit to destroy them no one could complain.’” 193 Like Behrnd-Klodt, McGowan
explains that Congress recognized the private ownership of presidential papers before PRMPA
through their purchases of documents in the possession of the heirs of the presidents. 194 The
materials in question in the case of the United States v. Ralph McElvenny, the John F. Kennedy
Museum Foundation were not being claimed under PRMPA but rather on the basis of the deed,
as Kennedy’s presidency preceded the passage of the law that renders presidential papers to be
public records.
In the court decision, the judge found that the defendants received the materials through
several intermediaries, but that Kennedy’s secretary Evelyn Lincoln originally acquired the
records, “improperly” taking them and giving them to collector Robert White. 195 In 2003, the
court denied the defendant’s request to dismiss the replevin action, but the case summary does
not provide further insight into a final determination concerning ownership. 196 It is necessary to
reach beyond the scholarly literature and case law to resources such as NARA’s Prologue, a
quarterly magazine, to locate information about what occurred following the judge’s denial of
McElvenny’s motion to dismiss the replevin action. 197 This dissertation will examine the
implications of the McElvenny case for NARA’s replevin efforts, thus bringing the settlement
into the scholarly literature.

North Carolina was successful in the 1970s recovering the bills of indictment in State of
North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. The state was again successful in the first decade of the 21st
century in a case that gained even greater attention, one that revolved around the rightful owner
of an original copy of the Bill of Rights. News reports and popular literature connected a public
much broader than the archival community to the circumstances surrounding the case. While not
scholarly in nature and therefore technically not within the scope of this literature review, two
books for a popular audience deserve brief recognition here: David Howard’s Lost Rights: The
Misadventures of a Stolen American Relic and Robert K. Wittman’s Priceless: How I Went
Undercover to Rescue the World's Stolen Treasures. Howard, a journalist, traces the fascinating
history of the copy of the Bill of Rights, which left the state of North Carolina during the Civil
War when a Union soldier pilfered it from a state office, and reminds readers that it was but one
of many documents that were taken by the Northerners. In the case of the Bill of Rights, Howard
explains that the soldier sold it to Charles Shotwell of Ohio for $5 in 1866. 198 In Priceless,
Wittman, the FBI agent who helped to formally establish the Art Crime Unit, discusses his role
in the Bill of Rights case. Wittman went undercover, posing as an interested buyer, to ensure
that the document was restored to the proper owner, the state of North Carolina. 199
In the scholarly literature, attorney Jeffrey R. Goss describes the litigation that
surrounded the original copy of the Bill of Rights in his article for the Charlotte Law Review.
The contextual information that Goss provides reflects much of what Howard, in a perhaps more
engaging narrative, recounts. Goss, however, explains that following the FBI’s seizure of the Bill
of Rights, which was authorized by a judge, the United States filed a civil forfeiture action

against the record. 200 The civil forfeiture action, which Jay A. Rosenburg describes as a property
seizure that is “widely perceived by law enforcement agencies to be an effective additional
deterrent against criminal activity,” gave the United States Marshals custody of the record while
North Carolina and the private parties who possessed the Bill of Rights settled the matter of
ownership. 201 The case of United States of America v. North Carolina's Original Copy of the Bill
of Rights reached the Eastern District of North Carolina court system, but, like those cases
described in the following section, the dispute was ultimately settled by the parties. North
Carolina was given ownership of the Bill of Rights in September 2003. 202
The case that most quickly followed the Bill of Rights dispute dealt with another seminal
record in United States history. In 2008, the Circuit Court of Fairfax County in Virginia heard
the case of Richard L. Adams, Jr. v. State of Maine, which was concerned with the ownership of
an original copy of the Declaration of Independence. Both Adams, a resident of Virginia, and the
state of Maine claimed title to the document. An understanding of the history of the document is
necessary for understanding the court decision. In 1776, the Executive Council of Massachusetts
called for a printing of the Declaration of Independence so that copies could be disseminated to
ministers who would then share the text of the document to their congregations. After this point,
the Executive Council asked that the copies be sent to the town clerks who would record the
document “ ‘in their respective Town, or District Books, there to remain as a perpetual memorial
thereof.’” 203 At the time of the order, Massachusetts encompassed the territory that is today
Maine. 204

The case reveals that, in 1995, a resident of Wiscasset, Maine (a town formerly called
Pownalborough) discovered one of the original copies of the Declaration of Independence in the
attic of a deceased daughter of a former town clerk. The document was auctioned and ultimately
acquired by Adams in 2001 for $475,000. Maine initiated a replevin action against Adams in an
effort to recover the object and, in turn, Adams sued the state in order to “quiet title.” 205 The
Circuit Court in Fairfax County found that Adams was indeed the rightful owner of the item, a
decision that was upheld by the Supreme Court of Virginia in the 2009 case of State of Maine v.
Richard L. Adams, Jr. 206 The court decision reinforces the discussion in the literature regarding
the ambiguous nature of a public record. The state of Maine identified the copy as a public
record that was therefore the property of the government. Two courts in Virginia disagreed,
demonstrating an understanding of the nature of public records that reflects the above statutory
definitions. The private printers were not public officials, the courts found, and therefore the
copy was not a public record. The Supreme Court of Virginia stipulated that while the prints
were not public records, the town clerks’ records relating to the Declaration of Independence
would be deemed as such, a determination that demonstrates the nuances that can riddle the
division between public and private records. 207
One of the most recent replevin cases differs from those discussed above in that it
involves a county’s efforts to recover alienated materials. The case of Jefferson County,
Tennessee v. Margaret V. Smith was a victory for the local government in Jefferson County and
concerned the ownership of an unexecuted marriage license that the county clerk issued to Davy

Crockett in 1805. 208 While Bain’s study found that Tennessee had no replevin law at the time of
his writing in 1983, this has since changed, with the passage of a statute that Bain likely would
have coded as among the most stringent of the replevin legislation. 209 Jefferson County brought
the replevin action against Smith on the basis of this statute, a section of the Tennessee Code
Annotated. 210 The dispute between Jefferson County and Smith reflected the issue of
abandonment that Sparling raises in his discussion of the Works Progress Administration prints.
The defendant claimed that the county discarded the record and that a relative had obtained it
only after this decision was made. Neither the trial court nor the appeals court accepted this
account, citing the county’s custody of marriage licenses that were contemporaneous to the
Crockett record. Smith was ordered to transfer the record to Jefferson County. 211
The case of United States of America v. Laurie Zook is the most recent public records
replevin case that has reached the federal courts in the United States. Like United States v. Ralph
McElvenny, The John F. Kennedy Museum Foundation, this dispute surrounded a document
signed by a former President of the United States. Laurie Zook, defendant in the case, discovered
a pardon that was handwritten and signed by Abraham Lincoln in a vacant home that she was
preparing for sale. The record pardoned Sergeant Major Adam Laws of the 19th Regiment of the
United States Colored Troops, a division of the military whose papers are now in NARA’s
collection. 212 The United States was ultimately successful in recovering the record, with the
court granting ownership to the federal government in August 2012. 213.

What is collectively learned from considering these cases? First, legal research reveals
that the group of replevin cases brought to court is somewhat larger than what Peterson and
Peterson and Behrnd-Klodt suggest. Interestingly, there is no mention in the archival literature
of, for example, Maine’s failure to recover an original copy of the Declaration of Independence
in 2009 or one Tennessee county’s lengthy crusade to successfully regain a Davy Crockett
marriage license. The group of cases, still limited in number, exhibits a relatively even level of
success for government archives and for private parties; government archives are not victorious
in every replevin case that is brought to court, nor are they experiencing regular losses when they
do sue for recovery.
The cases, as a collective, provide some insight into how public records leave
government custody and enter private hands, with three primary causes emerging. Public
officials retain custody of records after terminating their employment, viewing them as their own
property. Records are displaced during wartime. Finally, archival theft puts records into the
possession of parties who are not the rightful owners. These themes are fleshed out not only in
the cases that are settled in a courtroom, but also in those resolved through negotiations among
parties.

II.F. REPLEVIN OF PUBLIC RECORDS OUTSIDE OF COURT
As a result of open records laws in the United States, the court records surrounding replevin
actions that reach federal and state courts are readily accessible. Conversely, there is relatively
limited writing in the archival or legal field about replevin cases that are resolved out of court

65

following negotiations among parties. This section is, as a consequence, significantly more
limited in scope than the preceding section but is the specific focus of this dissertation research.
Two articles in the American Archivist underscore a link between replevin and theft while
also providing insight into recovery efforts that are settled without a lawsuit. Aaron Purcell’s
lively account of insider theft at the Library of Congress highlights the government’s efforts to
retrieve stolen records from individuals who purchased them without being aware that they were
pilfered from the repository. William Benjamin, the dealer who purchased stolen documents
from the thieves aided the government in its case against Lewis McKenzie Turner and Philip
McElhone and agreed to return the materials to the Library of Congress. Purcell notes that
Benjamin did so after making a request for monetary compensation from the government, which
he was not awarded. 214 To Purcell, the case of Turner and McElhone highlights the need to
address what compensation should be given to individuals who unknowingly acquire stolen
materials and are subsequently forced to return them. 215 However, because of the inalienability
of a public record that is outlined above, the government may not be required to purchase
materials that have left their custody, even when the records are in the possession of a party who
is not a thief and instead an unknowing buyer.
Of the literature that does exist concerning cases settled outside of court, two articles are
written by individuals who were directly associated with the negotiations in some capacity.
Bruce Stark, former Assistant State Archivist at the Connecticut State Library, discusses another
case that demonstrates the connection between replevin and theft, one that he can speak to
firsthand. In the early 2000s, state archivists at the Connecticut State Library in Hartford
identified records at the Pequot Museum and Research Center in Mashantucket, Connecticut that

they believed had been stolen from their institution. What followed was a dispute between the
Connecticut State Library and the Pequot Museum, two institutions that felt they had proper title
to the papers. Through a Connecticut state investigation, it was determined that the documents
had been stolen by a man named Walter Plowman, who had taken an estimated 600 public
records from the Connecticut State Library. Plowman sold the disputed records in question to a
manuscript dealer who, in turn, sold them to the Pequot Museum. Through the return of the
materials to the Connecticut State Library in October and November of 2002, the negotiations
were brought to resolution. 216
The publication Manuscripts, a non-peer reviewed publication of the Manuscript Society,
offers a discussion of a replevin settlement that, like Stark’s piece, is a firsthand account. Writing
about a 1980s dispute in Louisiana that surrounded land survey documents, Patricia Brady
Schmit describes a “compromise” that resolved the question of ownership and custody of the
materials without the involvement of the courts. Schmit, the Historic New Orleans Collection’s
director of publications, explains that, poised for sale in a public auction, the survey documents
drew the interest of both the Historic New Orleans Collection (HNOC) and the State of
Louisiana. On November 1, 1982, however, the seller, the Western Reserve Historical Society,
removed four of the six auction lots from the public sale, a decision that followed the State of
Louisiana’s threat of replevin. The Historic New Orleans Collections purchased the remaining
two lots.
Following the Louisianan Attorney General’s determination that the Louisiana State
Archive and Record Service would be the proper state repository for these materials, the state

216

67

archivist released a report on the matter in which he echoed the ownership claim. 217 In a decision
that seemingly was made to avoid the cost of replevin litigation in the courts, the dispute was
ultimately resolved through an agreement between the State of Louisiana and the Historic New
Orleans Collection. Schmit explains the terms of the agreement as follows:
The State of Louisiana waived all claims of ownership to these documents
and requested HNOC to complete its purchase from the Western Reserve
Historical Society. The Collection complied with the request and purchased
the documents. The Collection then donated the documents to the State,
retaining for a period of thirty years the exclusive right to possess, use,
process, publish, and make the documents available for research. It
presented a microfilm copy [to the state archivist]. 218
Schmit’s account suggests that settlements between parties may consist of terms other than the
direct transfer of custody to the state.
This dissertation expands this body of writing on replevin cases settled between parties. It
has certainly not been the case that there have been only three cases in which individuals have
turned over custody of public records without the intervention of the courts; discussions with
individuals at government archives and a study of institutional records have confirmed that this
is, in fact, the more common route that recovery efforts take.

II.G. REPLEVIN, PRIVATE DEALERS, AND COLLECTORS
As is the case with the issue of repatriation in the art field, the literature indicates there are two
generic camps that have formed around the issue of replevin of archival materials. Dow’s recent
Archivists, Collectors, Dealers, and Replevin: Case Studies on Private Ownership of Public

Documents effectively captures the division that has historically existed around this topic, a
division that will be probed in this dissertation research.
Rhoads explains that because resolving the issue of title and ownership may involve the
courts, there is tension between archivists and collectors and dealers surrounding the issue of
replevin. 219 In discussing United States v. First Trust Company of Saint Paul, Boyd points to
concerns among private collectors and dealers that the replevin action was “the initial move in a
plan to assemble in the National Archives all official records of whatever nature, of whatever
rank, wherever found.” 220 Just as encyclopedic museums have voiced concern that repatriation
efforts by source countries will empty museum galleries, collectors viewed United States v. First
Trust Company of Saint Paul as potentially a blanket precedent that would prompt a flurry of
replevin actions by the government.
A series of articles in Manuscripts captured this concern. Robert F. Metzdorf, in an
article entitled “Lewis and Clark I: A Librarian’s Point of View,” articulates the fundamental
concern that he feels should be shared by the manuscripts community. He warns, “If the
government wins this suit, there is danger that a precedent will have been established which will
open all existing collections to confiscation of documents originated by persons in government
employ, no matter what the nature of those papers.” 221 Fear and alarmism are evident in
Metzdorf’s statement, but there is another perceptible element as well. Metzdorf certainly does
not acknowledge the legitimacy of the government’s ownership of all records generated during
the course of public business. Instead, he references the “nature” of the public records as being

219

69

an important consideration, suggesting that there are records that the government should not
claim. He, however, provides no explication of this clause.
Opposition to replevin is perhaps most evident in John M. Taylor’s History in Your
Hand: Fifty Years of the Manuscript Society. In a chapter tellingly titled “David and Goliath: The
Lewis and Clark Case,” Taylor describes the position held by the Manuscript Society, the notable
organization of autograph and manuscript collectors, at the time of the case and its efforts to
raise funds for the defense. 222 Taylor, the former president of the Manuscript Society, expresses
the group’s belief that the successful replevin of the Clark papers would have made historical
documents less available to the public. He argues that collectors and private institutions may
have been less inclined to display or provide access to them in fear that they may be the next
targets of a replevin action. 223 His is a very different response than what Boyd articulates in his
article for American Archivist. Taylor’s text is useful in gaining perspective on the Manuscript
Society’s reaction to the court decision in the State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. case.
Describing the court’s decision in favor of the State of North Carolina, Taylor remarks that it
was a “setback for the Manuscript Society and the broader collector community alike.” 224
Like Taylor, Gandert touches on the potential implications of collectors’ fear of replevin.
He notes that the looming possibility of a replevin action “may well have a chilling effect on
collectors” and posits that individuals may even choose to destroy targeted records rather than
incur the litigation costs of replevin. 225 Gandert, writing in 1982, suggests that the fear of
replevin actions may also lead to less transparency in the sale and purchase of archival materials.

Dealers may choose not to share information about the materials they sell and collectors may
insist on an agreement with the dealer stipulating that their names will not be released to outside
parties. 226
At a session of the 2010 annual meeting of the Society of American Archivists, David
Haury, Director of the Bureau of Archives and History at the Pennsylvania Historical and
Museum Commission, explained that the Council of State Archivists and the Manuscripts
Society have been engaged in discussion about the sale of public documents. Haury is of the
opinion that there is a fundamental division between the two parties that will likely not
disappear. While archivists hold the position that they have an “obligation” to retrieve all public
documents, a sentiment also expressed by Bahmer, Haury maintains that most dealers and
collectors believe it is acceptable to purchase and sell public documents that were never in an
archives. 227 Although there is this difference of opinion, Haury indicates archivists and dealers
have come to an agreement to engage in due diligence in determining the provenance of a
record. 228

III. METHODOLOGY

III.A. CASE STUDIES AS A STRATEGY FOR INQUIRY
This dissertation employs a case study approach, examining the State Archives of North
Carolina, the Pennsylvania State Archives, and the Library of Virginia. Martyn Hammersley and
Roger Gomm acknowledges that “in one sense, all research is case study: there is always some
unit, or set of units, in relation to which data are collected and/or analysed.” 229 The authors note,
however, that case study research is distinct from research that is experimental or survey-based
and generally “refers to research that investigates a few cases, often just one, in considerable
depth.” 230 Robert E. Stake would characterize this dissertation as a “collection case study,” in
which more than one case is studied “in order to inquire into the phenomenon, population, or
general condition.” 231 Replevin, as the archival field understands the term, is the phenomenon
that is examined through a study of the state archives in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and
Virginia. These three cases are “constituent member[s] of a target population,” which is, in this
study, public archives. 232

When engaging in case study research, there must be a rationale behind the selection of
the objects of study. In this dissertation, the cases were selected with a number of considerations
in mind, but the legal environment for replevin was the primary motivator. Archivists who are
familiar with replevin or public records are likely aware of some of the activities by the State
Archives of North Carolina; in recent years, media outlets directed attention to the recovery of
the state’s original copy of the Bill of Rights and a current Deputy Attorney General of the state
has presented on replevin at a Society of American Archivists meeting. The state’s replevin
activities were earlier a matter of attention and scrutiny in the 1970s, when the archives was
simultaneously involved in recovering a George Washington letter and the bills of indictment
signed by William Hooper, the latter which was decided in court. With case law precedent and a
piece of legislation that codifies the recovery of public records, North Carolina was presumed, at
the start of the dissertation project, to have the most favorable legal environment for state efforts
in this area. The selection of Pennsylvania was based on the very different circumstances for
replevin. David Haury, State Archivist of Pennsylvania, has called attention to the absence of
state legislation and case law precedent related to replevin of public records. 233 The
Commonwealth of Virginia's legal environment for replevin is closer to that of North Carolina
than Pennsylvania. The inclusion of Virginia in this study is to determine whether the court
opinion that split the records, giving ownership to both Virginia and to the dealer, weakened and
diminished the frequency of the state's replevin efforts.

Peter Yeager and Kathy Kram suggest that, in order for an organization to be willing to
engage with researchers, there must be some benefit that would come from participation. 234 The
nature of the organizations studied in this dissertation arguably lifts this necessity of providing an
identifiable payoff. These are government archival institutions that exist in order to collect and
preserve public records for public use. As research facilities, they should, at least theoretically,
support dissertation research without the expectation of some received benefit, even if the
research is not entirely archival in nature. Moreover, the open access public records laws exist to
provide transparency to members of the public. They do not, with the exception of classified
categories of records, allow for the governmental body to refuse a request for access or to require
a payoff in return for the access.
Stake, who has published extensively on case studies, characterizes the approach as “a
small step toward grand generalization,” but cautions researchers that “generalization should not
be emphasized in all research.” 235 Each replevin case has unique characteristics that shape the
state government’s recovery process and influence the custody determination. Through an
analysis of interviews and records of cases resolved between parties, this dissertation presents a
visual representation of the replevin process and discusses individual cases of replevin through
this conceptualization. Moreover, the dissertation considers what lessons can be drawn from the
climate and practices in three states with regard to the influence of state law and case precedent.
The approach is a multi-site and comparative case study, which G.E. Gorman and Peter
Clayton explain should involve selecting sites that “reflect a range of subjects or settings

applicable to the topic.” 236 The authors identify “analytic induction” as a method for analyzing
the data collected through an investigation of multiple cases. The paper utilizes an analytic
induction technique from Gorman and Clayton that reflects the following process:
The identification of a preliminary definition and explanation of the phenomenon
of study at the start of the research;
The collection of data and continuous examination of how the data compares and
contrasts to the preliminary definition and explanation;
The continuous modification of the preliminary definition and explanation to
better reflect the data and findings from case study research;
A final redefinition of the phenomenon of study based on the comparative case
study research. 237
This technique is applied by beginning with the legal definition of replevin, the phenomenon that
is, of course, the focus of this study. Through an examination of cases that are resolved outside
of the courts, this accepted legal definition is modified to better reflect what is occurring more
commonly in the archival field.

III.B. DATA SOURCES
Raya Fidel, in an essay in Qualitative Research in Information Management, characterizes case
study research as qualitative in nature and Hammersley and Gomm echo this, remarking,
“Frequently, but not always, it implies the collection of unstructured data, and the qualitative
analysis of those data.” 238 Textual data sources, coupled with semi-structured interviews with

individuals associated with replevin cases, serve as the entry points for analysis on the process of
replevin.
As James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium plainly observe, there is “no single correct
approach” to the analysis of data. 239 In this study, the analysis is inductive, in that patterns and
themes related to the process for identification and recovery of public records emerge directly
from the data. The visual and generalized representation of replevin, presented first in Chapter
Four, emerged from coding the data sources related to individual replevin narratives.
Data Source 1: Court Records
There is a twofold purpose for examining the relevant court records. First, the common law
tradition places court precedent in a role of central importance to the judicial system in the
United States. This has bearing for replevin of public records. Government archives can use
precedent to add weight to their claim of ownership of public records and those private parties in
possession of the materials may point to the case law to demonstrate how the circumstances of
their case differ from previous disputes. Moreover, in the rare instance in which replevin cases
involving public records reach the courts, judges will look to the case law to come to a decision.
Second, the access to court records is methodologically important to this study to allow
for a point of comparison to cases that are negotiated outside of the courts. Given that few cases
involving replevin of public records actually reach the courts, the interest that drives this study is
to uncover the internal federal and state processes in place. The court cases that follow the
codified process of replevin act as a contrast to those that are settled through negotiations
between parties. What pushes cases into the court system? Are there circumstances that

Interviewing: New Lenses, New Concerns, ed. James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage
Publications, 2003), 26.
239

76

characterize these cases that are distinct from those resolved internally? These are questions that
guide the analysis of the court records.
Data Source 2: Statute
Stare decisis, literally “to stand by things decided,” is a principle that is fundamental to the
common law system. Stare decisis means that judges are guided by court precedent in building a
body of law. This is in contrast to the system of civil law, which places a primary emphasis on
legal statute. Still, legislation, of course, exists and is relevant to the judicial system in the United
States. While replevin is a common law writ, it is, as evidenced by the replevin of public records
statutes, sometimes codified.
In the United States, legislative statute may serve to define “public record” and codify
governmental replevin of public records. 240 The absence of legislation that does the latter can act
as a hindrance to successful recovery on a state level. David Haury, State Archivist of
Pennsylvania, conveys this challenge in describing the absence of clearly defined laws related to
public records in Pennsylvania in Access Archives, the Pennsylvania State Archives’ newsletter.
He writes, “The Commonwealth should pass a replevin or recovery of government records law
which allows both state and local governments to recover their records which have been stolen or
otherwise alienated from government custody. Without such legislation it is extremely difficult
to repatriate to government custody any documents which appear for sale online, such as on eBay, or in dealers' catalogs.” 241 With the dual importance of precedent and statute in matters
involving replevin of public records, I analyzed the legislation of relevance for replevin actions
by the state governments of North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.

Data Source 3: Semi-Structured Interviews
Given that public records replevin cases are generally negotiated outside of the courts, there is a
subsequent absence of legal records associated with them. This dissertation uncovers the internal
processes for identification and recovery of public records in private hands through semistructured interviews with individuals associated with the organizational efforts. While
quantitative researchers select participants at random, the interview subjects in this qualitative
study are purposefully chosen based on their involvement with replevin cases and their ability to
speak to the process of recovering public records in private hands. The interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed by the researcher in their entirety. There were some instances in which
telephone and face to face conversations were treated more informally and not recorded; such
conversations provided context, often for interviews that later followed.
Comparability in interviews is, as Mark Benney and Everett C. Hughes note, a
methodological convention that is beneficial to the researcher. 242 As such, this project employed
a semi-structured interview approach, allowing for some consistency in data analysis. As Adler
and Adler explain, the semi-structured interview permits researchers “to allow respondents to
shape the contours of the interview.” 243 The interview participant’s responses prompted
additional questions and conversation during the interview and the general interview script was
modified as necessary during the data collection process.

Data Source 4: Records Related to Replevin Cases
There were two ways in which records were accessed in this study. The first, and the most
valuable, was through archival research. In the study of each jurisdiction, the administrative
records of the archives were sources of data about individual replevin cases. The benefit to
studying the archival record was that it afforded a historical view of replevin, one that enabled
the study of how different eras of institutional leadership approached and prioritized recovery of
public records. Archival research was conducted at the State Archives of North Carolina, the
Pennsylvania State Archives, Old Economy Village, the Library of Virginia, and the Library of
Virginia State Records Center Archives Annex. The submission of records requests was the
second means of securing documentation related to replevin in North Carolina and
Pennsylvania. 244
I deliberated about naming the individuals who appeared in the records. Names are not
essential pieces of information in the replevin stories; the more essential pieces of information
are whether the players were private citizens or public officials and, if they are latter, what
position they hold. I decided that it was appropriate to use individuals’ names if they were

present in the archival records. These are public archives where any researcher can access the
materials with a visit. In the case of records accessed by requests, I used the names of the public
officials but chose not to refer to the private party by name. I articulated this second decision to
the legal counsel at the State Archives of North Carolina and gathered that this was the
preference of the state.
Data Source 5: Email Communications
Instances arose during the course of this research in which it was necessary to follow-up with
interview participants and to direct reference inquiries to additional parties. For example, after I
was informed that replevin cases in Virginia generally occur on a local level, I relied on email to
ask circuit court clerks if they had been involved in any recovery efforts during their terms in
office.

The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Pittsburgh characterized this project as
an exempt non-human study. Because this is a study about an institutional process, the IRB did
not require written consent from the participants. The documentation of correspondence with the
IRB is included in Appendix A.

IV. THE NORTH CAROLINA CASE

“And those who buy hot goods do so at their own risk.” 245
For those familiar with replevin, the selection of the North Carolina Department of Cultural
Resources the State Archives of North Carolina as a case will be an unsurprising decision. The
state’s victory in the case of State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. was a watershed, bringing
media attention and cries of concern from select members of the records community. Since the
1970s, the state has continued to pursue alienated records, motivated by what state officials view
as a moral imperative to reconnect the public with the records of the government. “Our
reputation for how dogged we are for getting the documents back precedes us,” said the Deputy
Secretary of the Department of Cultural Resources, and the successful recovery of the North
Carolina copy of the Bill of Rights served to popularize this reputation as the determined
stewards of the state’s heritage. 246 The North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources and the
State Archives of North Carolina are included in this study because of the authority they possess,
through statute and case law, in the area of replevin and public records. The chapter considers the
implications of the legal environment for the state’s replevin efforts.

IV.A. THE MEANING OF PUBLIC RECORD IN NORTH CAROLINA
Today, all initial correspondence from the Department of Cultural Resources to a private party in
possession of an alienated public record includes a reference to the statutory definition of “public
records.” Located in section 132-1(a) of North Carolina’s General Statutes, the General
Assembly defines public record as a category that includes:
all documents, papers, letters, maps, books, photographs, films, sound
recordings, magnetic or other tapes, electronic data-processing records,
artifacts, or other documentary material, regardless of physical form or
characteristics, made or received pursuant to law or ordinance in
connection with the transaction of public business by any agency of
North Carolina government or its subdivisions.247
This is an encompassing definition, one that includes elements that Elizabeth Dow observes as
common to statutory formalizations of the term. A public record in North Carolina is
characterized by having been received or created by a government entity during the course of
government transactions. In addition, the state specifies that medium is immaterial; a public
record can be fixed as analog or digital forms. 248
During the 1970s, public officials, private collectors, and the North Carolina court system
were deeply focused on understanding the division between the public and the private. It is a
decade marked by the case against B.C. West Jr., the codification of a recovery process with
General Statutes sections 132-5 and 132-5.1, and reactions to these developments in the form of
journal articles, newsletter pieces, and briefs to the court. The opinion of the North Carolina
Court of Appeals in State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr., upheld by the Supreme Court of
North Carolina, built on the codified definition of a North Carolina “public record” by specifying
the inclusion of a group of materials. The ruling in this case places records that predate

82

independence and the formation of the state of North Carolina in this category. The bills of
indictment, the records in dispute, were issued in 1767 and 1768 and signed by William Hooper,
then the attorney for the Crown. In their argument for custody of the two bills, public officials
pointed to a 1766 act of the Colonial Assembly that gave the responsibility for the management
and keeping of court records to the court clerk and the courts found that custody should have
remained with post-colonial North Carolina. As Price reported in his piece for The American
Archivist, the Supreme Court of the State found that “sovereignty does not lapse…sovereignty of
the crown became sovereignty of the state.” 249 This precedent established colonial court records
as the records of the state of North Carolina, broadening the meaning of public records to include
records “ made or received pursuant to law … by any agency of North Carolina government or
its subdivisions” to records made or received during the transaction of colonial court business.
The North Carolina Court of Appeals maintained “the form, substance, and nature of the
indictments involved in the instant case imparted notice to the world that they were court records
of North Carolina,” an opinion that the Supreme Court upheld. 250
While B.C. West, Jr. and his supporters argued that the state had abandoned the property,
the court found that a records custodian does not have the authority to discard public records.
The Supreme Court justices cited the public records section in American Jurisprudence, which
reads,
Public records and documents are the property of the State and not of the
individual who happens, at the moment, to have them in his possession; and when
they are deposited in the place designated for them by law, there they must
remain, and can be removed only under authority of an act of the Legislature and
in the manner and for the purpose designated by law. The custodian of a public

record cannot destroy it, deface it, or give it up without authority from the same
source which required it to be made. 251
In doing so, the North Carolina Supreme Court created case law that supported North Carolina
statutory law in section 121-5(b). Public records are records that must be disposed of in
accordance to law or by the express permission of the General Assembly, not at the will of the
custodian. This principle of the inalienability of public records is not captured in the statutory
definition in Chapter 132, but is codified in section 121-5(b) of the North Carolina General
Statutes. Under this section, a public record can be transferred to a private party only with
express permission from the General Assembly of the state or from the North Carolina Historical
Commission, the policymaking body for the Department of Cultural Resources that is composed
of gubernatorial appointees. 252
The current State Archivist offered a description of public record that was less legal and
more emotive. She cited the collective interest and meaning in a public record as what sets it
apart from a private manuscript. In the case of the recovery copy of the Bill of Rights, she said
that citizens appreciated why such a significant record should be available to all. She explained,
“We tend to educate the public primarily through our biggest case with the Bill of Rights…The
public by and large understands that there are some things that just belong to the government – to
everyone, to the public.” 253 This is an interesting comment in that it deemphasizes the complex
division between private and public records that others, like Holmes, have observed and rather
frames the division in a way that non-records professionals can appreciate. Instead, Koonts offers
a simple litmus test: If a record has meaning to the collective citizenry of North Carolina, it

should not be in the hands of one citizen alone. It should, instead, be available to all.
Thornton T. Mitchell, North Carolina’s State Archivist from 1973 to 1981 offered a
definition of public records that manages to succinctly capture the elements codified by the
General Statutes, the principle of inalienability, and the publically-held “rights in or to things, the
“things” being the records of government transactions. 254 “Public records,” he told his legal
counsel, “are made or received by public officials in the transaction of public business and, as
such, are the property of the public. Public records retain their public nature in perpetuity unless
they are deliberately alienated.” 255 Mitchell evidently did not include records approved for
destruction as among those that the state “deliberately alienated.” They remain, he maintained,
the property of the state. A deliberate alienation, presumably, would be one authorized in
accordance to section 121-5(b) of the General Statutes. In his testimony in the case challenging
West’s custody of the bills of indictment, Mitchell provided this interpretation of the principle of
inalienability: “Since 1903 some papers which had been authorized to be destroyed were
inadvertently, or by some other means, not destroyed, but were dispersed into the hands of
private individuals … If the papers had been consumed by fire, they would have been State
property up to the last moment of existence, but if they escaped fire, and got in the hands of
someone that kept them, they would still be State property.” 256

IV.B. THE SHAPE OF REPLEVIN
Through coding the interview data and records from each of the three cases studies, a pattern to
the replevin process emerged. This basic structure, depicted in Figure 4, serves as the framework
from which an understanding of replevin activities and decisions in each of the three jurisdictions
studied is built. It is a process that consists of six stages that generally follows a linear
progression, though activities in the stages can occur concurrently. States can choose to
reconsider decisions made and actions taken in a previous stage, particularly when it reaches
what this dissertation terms the negotiation stage.

Figure 4: The Replevin Process
Throughout this dissertation, discovery refers to the initiation of the replevin process
through the act of locating of a record that is believed to be public property. A study of replevin
cases in each jurisdiction revealed two means through which the discovery occurs: through an

86

internal discovery by the state archives or through contact with an external party who informs the
archives of the alienated record. Individuals at each of the repositories said that staff monitor
eBay and auction house catalogs to some extent. However, the cases presented in this
dissertation suggest that the replevin process more commonly begins through contact with an
outside party.
The identification stage of the replevin process encompasses the activities that a state
archives engages in to determine whether the record in question is public property. The outcome
of this stage, however, is not a definitive or irrefutable determination of the record’s nature; as
Holmes aptly observed, there are “conflicting views and definitions of public records” that
complicate the replevin process. 257 When disagreement arises between a state archives and a
private party in a replevin case, the identification of the record as public is often at the root of the
dispute.
Selection refers to the state’s appraisal decision regarding the alienated record. There are
two components to this stage. First, the state determines whether the record is archival, meaning
whether it has long-term value for the public, and, second, the state decides whether it will
attempt to recover the record from the private party. Government archives do not
indiscriminately pursue all government records that are in private hands; this is an important
finding of the dissertation that is addressed in each case study. Instead, it is possible to learn
about archival appraisal in the public sector by looking at the records that the government targets
for recovery.
The negotiation stage of the replevin process includes the activities and decisions that
follow the state’s initial request for the document and leading to a determination of ownership.
As the cases in this dissertation illustrate, seldom do the cases have a litigious tone at their start.
257

Holmes, “ ‘Public Records,’” 4-5.

87

The state generally begins negotiations for the return of the record by citing the public interest in
having the record in a public repository. Where there is neither case law nor an explicit statute
related to replevin, a stalemate at this stage can prompt the state to revaluate the pursuit of the
record, prompting a return to the selection stage. If there is fear that the record will be sold or
disappear underground, states with a replevin statute can petition the court to seize the record
until custody is determined.
The custody determination is the point in the replevin process in which the parties reach a
decision concerning the possession of the record. Concessions often occur at this stage, which
are addressed below. If negotiations fail and if the government archives chooses, the state may
ask the court to render a custody determination. The state archives reaches the archival
accessioning stage only when it succeeds in recovering the record in question. There are
decisions made at this time concerning how the item will be integrated back into the collection
and described. Decisions at this stage affect whether future users of the now-archival record will
be able to glean from its arrangement and description that it was once out of public custody.
This is the first layer of the replevin process, a basic structure that is consistent among
each of the case studies and upon which common practices in the state are added for a second
layer. The third layer is built from the examination of a set of individual cases in each state and a
consideration of what these narratives reveal about replevin and public and private property
issues.

IV.C. THE REPLEVIN PROCESS IN NORTH CAROLINA
Discussions with representatives of the Department of Cultural Resources affirmed that
individuals in the archival field use the term “replevin” more broadly than its technical legal
meaning. Kevin Cherry, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Cultural Resources and Director
of the Office of Archives and History, defined replevin as “the action taken to retrieve property
belonging to the people that are out of the hands of the people.” 258 He included recovery cases
that enter litigation and those do not. North Carolina statute, however, does not actually include
the term replevin. Instead sections 132-5 and 132-5.1 include the phrases “regaining custody”
and “seeking the return” to describe the process of recovering public records. The Special
Deputy Attorney General, the legal counsel for the Department of Cultural Resources, said that
while she knows that some states have statutes that employ the term “replevin,” she refers to
such an action as a “recovery of alienated records.”
In State of North Carolina v. B.C. West Jr., the defense argued that the state’s statute of
limitations for recovering the records had long expired. The North Carolina Supreme Court,
however, cited the common law doctrine of nullum tempus occurrit regi, a Latin expression that
translates to the phrase “no time runs against the king.” An ancient common law doctrine that
refers to the sovereign’s immunity to statutes of limitations, the court found that the state of
North Carolina could pursue public records in private hands regardless of when the records
escaped government custody. 259 Public records are inalienable and the Department of Cultural
Resources is not subject to the same time restrictions that affect private citizens in their recovery
of personal property.

Karen Blum, Special Deputy Attorney General for the Department of Cultural Resources,
identified a series of approaches for recovering North Carolina’s public records in a session at
the 2010 Society of American Archivists meeting. The least severe, she explained, is the
issuance of a demand letter to the private party in possession of the record. If the record is
located in North Carolina, the State Archives may choose to implement sections 132-5 and 1325.1 of the North Carolina General Statutes, meaning that the Department of Cultural Resources
may petition the court for the seizure of the record in question or can file misdemeanor charges
against the resistant party who is in possession of it. In cases in which a record is out of state
borders, the state can cite federal law on the interstate trade of stolen goods and bring a civil
forfeiture action against the document; an example of this action is the case involving North
Carolina’s original copy of the Bill of Rights. 260 This chapter examines cases that fall into two
of these categories: cases that were resolved without the involvement of the court system and
cases in which the state petitioned for the seizure of the record but settled the matter with the
party. There were no located instances up to the time of writing in which the state filed criminal
charges as pursuant to section 132-5.1.
Discovery: Interviews with current public officials presented a glimpse into the replevin
process in North Carolina today. Discovery of alienated public records, the first stage described
above, most often occurs when a staff member or an individual in the public observes an item
available for sale online. While there are designated individuals on staff who regularly monitor
eBay, today’s replevin cases more frequently begin with an alert from an external party. 261 Both

specifically referenced the contributions from members of the collecting community in bringing
the state’s attention to item that may be public property. The State Archivist characterized this
action by collectors as a form of self-protection from a potentially unwise purchase. She
explained, “In the recent years to be honest with you, we have people bring our attention to
auction pieces because they don’t want to bid on it if we’re going to go after it. So we’ve actually
had collectors … that have contacted us and said, ‘Hey, are you aware that such and such letter is
for sale by this auction house?’ Because they don’t want to get in the middle of a government
record.” 262 This trend challenges the rhetoric of the collector as an adversary to the state archivist
in the matter of replevin. Although motivated by the apprehension of purchasing a record that
may be public property, the collectors, by bringing the discovery to the attention of the archives,
are serving as partners in the state’s replevin efforts.
Identification: Upon discovery, state officials must determine whether the record should
indeed be characterized as a public record. Today, this stage of the replevin process is localized
in the State Archives, which serves as “the research arm” of the replevin process. The State
Archivist explained that the registrar, who is responsible for the accessioning and deaccessioning
of records, leads the efforts to identify the item and its provenance. In researching the record, the
staff benefit from the recordkeeping practices of the antecedents to the State Archives. The State
Archivist maintained, “Even in the absence of the formal state archives before 1903 there is a
long history in North Carolina of good, strong centralized recordkeeping… [That] helps us as
much as [section] 132 with the process for seizing records.” 263 She pointed to the Governors’
letter books as an example of an identification tool that is the product of a historical
recordkeeping practice. In 1782, the North Carolina General Assembly mandated that the

Governor hire a clerk who was responsible for copying official correspondence received and sent
by the executive office in a letter book. The directive stipulated that government officials should
create letter books for the pre-1782 gubernatorial administrations. 264 The State Archives staff can
reference the letter books to produce evidence that the governor’s office received or issued the
letter the letter in question.
The Deputy Secretary of the Department of Cultural Resources, the individual who
makes the determination about pursuing a record, offered insight into identification efforts that
precede his decision. He stressed the importance of uncovering and understanding the
provenance at this stage. With a letter, for example, knowing the status of the recipient at the
time it was created is a critical piece of information for the staff. “If it was written to this person
in this time period in his capacity as a public official,” he explained, “it is a state document.” 265
At times, staff at the State Archives solicits the research aid and expertise of historians employed
within the Division of Historical Resources or from employees at one of the state’s museums or
historic sites.
When there are comparable records already in the State Archives collection, the
Department of Cultural Resources can point to the similarities between these records and the
alienated record support its ownership claim. In the case against B.C. West Jr. in the 1970s, the
Department of Cultural Resources contended that the presence of other Salsibury District Court
indictments from the years of 1767 and 1768 was evidence that the records in West’s possession
belonged to the state. 266 The North Carolina Supreme Court agreed that the existence of

“contemporaneous records” in the State archives casted shade on West’s position that the bills of
indictment were willfully abandoned by the state. 267
Not all public records are records that will be subject to a replevin action. H.G. Jones,
who served the state of North Carolina as both the State Archivist and as the Director of the
Department of Archives and History, commented on the court opinion in State of North Carolina
v. B.C. West Jr. and described to a colleague which records would fall outside of state interests.
He wrote, “The only records at issue are those that were alienated without proper legal
authority.” 268 If the State Archives identifies the alienated record as one that the General
Assembly authorized the transfer of title to, the Department of Cultural Resources has no claim
to it.
Selection: It is the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Cultural Resources who makes
the decision to pursue, following consultation and advice from staff in the Division of Archives
and Records and the legal counsel. The current Deputy Secretary, who also carries the title of
Director of the Office of Archives and History, said of the selection decision: “In North Carolina,
our tradition is we pursue, we pursue, we pursue. We go after anything we can reasonably show
is actually a state document. If we know that it exists and we know that it was ours and we know
it is a state document, we will go after it.” 269 The North Carolina Department of Cultural
Resources has a self-described reputation as a “bulldog” in the area of replevin. 270 Since
engaging in notable recovery efforts in the 1970s, state officials in North Carolina have actively
embraced what they describe as a moral imperative to ensure that public records are accessible to

the people. Like in the states that follow, however, decisions to pursue a record are measured and
based on a confident assessment that it is indeed public property. The current State Archivist
explained, “We are very careful in North Carolina to be good stewards in proving that this was in
our custody. We have passed up on going after things if it is iffy. I don’t want to go after
someone just to be aggressive.” 271
Even in North Carolina, there are instances in which the state will decline to pursue
records that are confidently identified as public property. When the state was involved in the case
against B.C. West Jr., Duke University and the American Library Association filed amicus
curiae briefs in support of the private manuscript dealer’s ownership of the bills of indictment. 272
In Duke University’s brief, the University’s legal counsel articulated the following concerns:
“Duke University is directly interested in the outcome of this case because the reasoning of the
Court of Appeals, if adopted by this Court, could result in a claim by the State to documents held
by the University… The result could have the wholesale, legally-sanctioned raiding of the great
(and lesser) collections in the libraries of private institutions.”273 The American Library
Association’s legal counsel expressed similar anxiety in the organization’s petition to the North
Carolina Supreme Court. 274 Even Larry E. Ties, Director of the North Carolina Division of
Archives and History from 1975 to 1981, did not share State Archivist Mitchell’s enthusiasm for
the state’s recovery efforts. He wrote, “In order to separate the impact that a judicial decision
would have in favor of replevin on semi-public and private archival institutions of good standing,
it seems to me that the concept of replevin must be refined and elaborated substantially in the

law before a Pandora’s box is opened that might lead to the destruction of such institutions” 275
Mitchell, responding to these concerns, distinguished between public records that are in the
hands of private individuals and auction houses and public records that are in institutional
archival collections. 276 Despite the Duke University’s voluntarily revelation that public records
are part of its archival collection, this dissertation research located no ownership claims by the
Department of Cultural Resources against the academic institution. The decision to refrain from
pursuing known public records that are in existing institutional collections is in line with
Peterson and Peterson’s set of recovery priorities; they suggest that if an alienated record is
available for researchers at another archival repository, the state may consider leaving it in the
collection. 277 There was, however, one exception to this policy discovered during the dissertation
research. In his testimony in the appeals case in State of North Carolina v. B.C. West Jr.,
Mitchell referenced an undated case in which the Department of Cultural Resources recovered a
series of Cumberland County records in the possession of the Cumberland County Public
Library. 278This case, however, did not spark similar efforts to recover public records in
repository collection.
In contrast to the cases of Pennsylvania and Virginia, the physical location of a record –
whether it is in state or out of state – does not significantly influence the Department of Cultural
Resources’ decision to pursue a record. Three of the four cases examined below involved records
that were outside of North Carolina. The state has not only been willing to pursue records that

are out of state, but also successful in doing so. This is contrary to the cases of Pennsylvania and
Virginia, where public officials are less inclined to enter negotiations with individuals who are
out of state.
Negotiation: Negotiations in the cases presented below follow a similar pattern. Either a
senior official within the Division of Archives and History of the legal counsel for the
Department of Cultural Resources sends a letter to the party in possession of the record in
question. This initial correspondence requests the “voluntarily return” of the item and cites
sections 132-1(a) – the definition of “public record” -- and 121-5(b) – the stipulation requiring
transfer of title by an act of the General Assembly -- as the statutory authority that enables the
state’s claim. In these cases, there was no reference at this time to sections 132.5 or 132-5.1,
which outlines the seizure process and the potential implications for a party who does not
comply with the state’s claim.
The current State Archivist of North Carolina stressed that a valuable approach in
replevin negotiations is one that focuses on educating the individual in possession of the record
about the mission of the State Archives and the importance of the record for the general
citizenry. She recalled one instance in which her predecessor invited the collector to Raleigh and
gave him a tour of the stacks to illustrate where and how the record in question would be
preserved. In another case, the current State Archivist aimed to educate the collector about just
why the state was so concerned about recovering a court docket. “ ‘It’s the earliest known docket
from the county,’ ” she told the party, “ ‘wouldn’t you rather have everyone see it rather than just
one person?’ ” 279 This tactic again places private dealers and collectors as partners, and
challenges the dichotomy of two camps that form around the replevin issue, one composed of
public archivists and the other of private citizens. Through education, collectors may become

willing collaborators to the state’s mission to make the records of the government available to the
people.
There is one matter that the Department of Cultural Resources will not negotiate. Unlike
the states studied below, public officials do not entertain discussions about monetary
compensation during the negotiations with the private party in possession of the record. The
absence of payment was, in the B.C. West Jr. case, a particularly divisive issue between the state
and the Manuscript Society. In the aftermath of the court decision, P. William Filby wrote to
Mitchell, “It is difficult to see why the State should have sought to receive them without paying
for them, and I am afraid that in the future the decision will be regarded by most collectors and
many institutions as the most unfortunate in the history of archives.” 280 Cherry, Deputy Secretary
of the Department of Cultural Resources and Director of the Office of Archives and History,
cited a continuation of the position former Department of Cultural Resources official Robert B.
House adopted when he was approached about purchasing the North Carolina copy of the Bill of
Rights in 1925. The state of North Carolina, House said, would not purchase its own property. 281
Today, Cherry said, “We’ll stand on what Robert House said.” 282
With the case against B.C. West Jr., there were individuals in the media and the
Manuscript Society membership who reacted strongly to the absence of compensation for the
bills of indictment. In an newspaper article titled “Who Has the Right to Old Documents,” one
reporter wrote, “North Carolina is the focus of a national debate among libraries and archivists
over whether governments have the right to take valuable documents from private collectors

without paying for them. State officials here are convinced they do have such a right, and proved
it earlier this year with a successful court battle to reclaim two colonial indictments” 283 “Old”
documents, however, are very different from “public records.” Today, the position of the
Department of Cultural Resources does not appear to elicit the same objections as those
responses that followed the North Carolina Supreme Court opinion in State of North Carolina v.
B.C. West. Jr. While the newspaper reporter implied that the state was performing an
unconstitutional takings without compensating West, such reactions do not accompany in the
more recent cases discussed in this chapter, suggesting perhaps a growth in understanding of the
state’s rights to public property.
Custody Determination: In cases that are settled outside of court by the Department of
Cultural Resources, a custody determination is generally recorded with an acknowledgement of
the transfer of the record. As illustrated in the cases examined below, private parties who transfer
the records that had been in their possession often characterize this transfer as a “donation,”
allowing them to receive a tax write-off. The interviewed officials within the Department of
Cultural Resources do not attach the same descriptor to these transfers and they are not willing to
issue a deed of gift, which is the practice if a party donates a private manuscript to the state. The
State Archivist said,
“We don’t really call it a donation. We don’t refer to it that way. We’re very
careful with our language. … But I’m not going to split hairs with people over a
word. It’s the same end result. And we’re not going to stop people from using it as
a tax write-off. We don’t get in the middle of that but we’ll sign that it’s here. If
the IRS are going to let you call it a donation, that’s between you and the IRS.
We’re not going to get in the middle of that…Some of the higher dollar things
that have come up for sale and then have been given back to us, they also tend to
be owners with deep pockets. So they may be just as satisfied taking a tax write
off for the ‘donation.’ ” 284

A study of the records associated with the custody resolutions affirms that the officials
within the Department of Cultural Resources are careful with the language. Because an
individual cannot donate property that does belong to him or her, the Department of Cultural
Resources does not use this term and do not acknowledge the transfer as a “gift.” The private
party’s use of the term – and, if the Internal Revenue Service, recognizes the transfer as a
“charitable donation” – does arguably challenge the characterization of the item as “public
property,” a point taken up below.
Archival Accessioning: If the State Archives of North Carolina recovers a record, it is
reunited with the collection, but forever marked as having been out of the custody of the state.
The current State Archivist and the registrar at the State Archives identified the past and
contemporary policy for arranging and describing these materials. When the State Archives
recovered alienated records, the past practice was to segregate the records from the original
record group. The registrar explained, “The document was normally added to our Vault
Collection due to its ‘historical’ value and to prevent any accidental inclusion in any chain of
custody determination for a record group.” 285 Today, the State Archives makes a copy of the
record on a different color paper and places the copy with the original record group so that
researchers have the opportunity to study it within its context.
In addition, the State Archives uses a coding system to mark the record as once out of
custody. If a record was out of government custody, for any reason, the State Archives will
indicate this with either an “SRX” for a state record or records or “CRX” for a county record or
records. The facsimile, the folder, and the box are stamped accordingly. The original document is
placed in the Vault Collection, which is also called the state’s “Treasures Collection.” The State
Archivist explained that this description and arrangement practice is “not really something that is

a replevin specified action, it’s just that we note that it’s been estranged for whatever reason for
some period of time.” 286 Both researchers and staff alike can learn that the record was out of
custody from a note in the electronic and paper finding aid as well. 287

IV.D. CASE STUDIES OF REPLEVIN IN NORTH CAROLINA
The cases studies examined in this chapter include one of the earliest replevin cases in North
Carolina, a dispute in the mid-1970s involving a 1790 letter from George Washington to the
North Carolina Governor and Council. The three cases that follow are more recent, having been
resolved during the past ten years; they provide insight into the modern replevin process in the
state. Two of these cases were resolved following demand letters and communication with the
holder. One of the cases entered litigation but was settled between the state and the private party.
The George Washington Letter
As former North Carolina State Archivist Thornton W. Mitchell tells it, the lawsuit against B.C.
West Jr. for the recovery of two bills of indictment was not about the bills of indictment. It was
about a letter sent by George Washington to the North Carolina Governor and his council on
August 26, 1790. “In regard to my personal motives in the West case,” Mitchell wrote, “I was
principally concerned about obtaining a modern precedent to support our efforts to recover the
George Washington letter.” 288
This was a case that was initiated by an external tip from an ironic source. On May 10,
1974, B.C. West Jr. contacted Paul Hoffman of the Department of Cultural Resources and called

his attention to the Washington letter advertised for an upcoming sale at Sotheby’s in New York
City (then Sotheby’s Parke Barnet, Inc.). 289 This contact preceded the state’s case challenging
West’s possession of the bills of indictment, though that would quickly follow. Although the
reasoning behind West’s notification does not emerge from the archival records related to the
case, his later contention that the state violated his private ownership rights suggest that West
was probably not concerned that state property was out of custody. Instead, it is more plausible
that West thought the State Archives may be interested in placing a bid for the letter. Believing
the letter to be alienated state property, Hoffman’s first step was to seek the advice of legal
counsel at the North Carolina Department of Justice. Thomas M. Ringer Jr., Associate Attorney
General, directed him to contact Sotheby’s and inform the auction house of “our interest in and
possible claim to the letter.” 290
Initial identification attempts began with study of a copy, a common approach in the
cases examined in this dissertation. The addressee was sufficient evidence, in the view of the
state, that the record was public property. Ringer maintained that the state’s case turned on the
argument that “delivery of a letter which is addressed to the Governor and Council of State is
prima facie evidence that title to said letter is vested in the State of North Carolina and that title
to the letter can be divested only be specific act of the General Assembly.” 291 Ringer’s stance is
in keeping with the statutory definition of “public record” located in section 132-1 and with
stipulation in 121-5(b) that only an authorization by the state legislature can transfer title of a
public record to a private party.

An examination of the actual record, however, proved to be a challenging venture for the
Department of Cultural Resources. While the letter was on consignment at Sotheby’s when the
state first learned of it, the auction house returned it to an anonymous party, prompting state
officials to fear that it “could be lost, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed to the irreparable harm
of the people of the State.” 292 Although the legal counsel for the state first requested a physical
examination of the record in July of 1974, it was not until January of 1977 that permission was
granted; leading up to this inspection, all efforts to petition the court for discovery of the name
and location of the private party in possession of the record were denied. 293 Even with the
challenges associated with examining an original record, the state officials were confident that
the record met both the statutory definition of “public record” and that it had never been legally
transferred to a private party, rendering it public property.
The Attorney General’s Office in North Carolina took the initial lead in negotiating the
case in 1974, issuing a demand letter to the anonymous holder care of his attorney. It read,
It is our belief that this letter from President Washington was received by the
State of North Carolina, that the ownership of the letter has never been lawfully
transferred by the State of North Carolina, and that the letter continues to be the
property of the State of North Carolina.
If this letter is in our actual or constructive possession and you can not produce
proof satisfactory to this office that your claim to this document is superior to the
right, title, and interest of the State of North Carolina, then we hereby demand
that you deliver possession of the aforesaid document by October 25, 1975. 294

In response, the attorney for the anonymous party in possession of the record raised three main
challenges to the state’s claim to ownership, challenges that crop up in the arguments of private
parties throughout the dissertation. First, the attorney questioned whether the state was able to
prove that George Washington actually ever mailed the letter. He cited the absence of physical
clues on the letter that were common to mailed documents from the period, namely the inclusion
of an address on the letter itself so that the sheets could double as an envelope. If the letter was
never mailed to the North Carolina Governor and his council, the attorney argued that it would
not be the property of the state. Second, the attorney maintained that even if the Department of
Cultural Resources was able to prove that Washington mailed the letter, it was not inconceivable
that the state had once sold or abandoned the letter, thus relinquishing its title to it. Finally, the
attorney objected to the suggestion that his client was required to exhibit superior title to the
state’s. “I would assume,” he said, “since my client not only has possession of the document but
has had that possession for many years, that the burden of proof of superior title would lie with
the state.” 295 With this response, officials with the North Carolina Attorney General’s Office told
the Department of Cultural Resources that they reached an impasse in negotiations. In the states
studied in the following chapters, such a realization occasionally prompted public officials to
reevaluate their interest in the item. Instead, North Carolina pushed forward, armed with the
belief that the absence of any official transfer of the record to a private party rendered it state
property.
With the approval of the Governor of North Carolina, the Attorney General’s Office and
the Department of Cultural Resources hired a New York-based attorney to represent the state in

103

the ownership claim. 296 During the time, the Department of Cultural Resources staff continued
their identification research and was able to collect evidence that countered the attorney for the
defense’s arguments. The Library of Congress’s collection of George Washington papers proved
to be a valuable resource; in one of the letter books, there was a transcription of a letter that
George Washington sent to the North Carolina Governor and his Council on August 26, 1790. 297
Years after the initial discovery – and now with the decision in the case against B.C.
West Jr. on the books – the attorney for the state was successful in brokering an agreement with
the anonymous holder and his attorney, with the individual agreeing to turn the letter over to the
state and filing for a tax benefit. The state expressed an interest in taking a hands-off approach to
the tax write-off, an interest that persists today. However, the North Carolina officials agreed to
furnish the holder and his attorney with a receipt that acknowledged the transfer, a common
component to modern custody determinations in the state. They went one step beyond what is the
practice in contemporary settlements, however, and provided the funds for a financial appraisal,
which was conducted by a party external to the state’s employ. 298
The language used in the custody agreement was of great concern to State Archivist
Mitchell. Upon receiving from the private party’s attorney the first iteration of the letter of
agreement, Mitchell wrote, “I take exception to the letter … which contains the statement: ‘One

of our clients…is the owner of a letter…’ I am not willing to concede that the person who has the
letter in his possession at the present time is the ‘owner’ since that is what this litigation is all
about. I am concerned that I may be asked to send an acknowledgement that I have received such
a letter and with this statement in it and I am not willing to do so.” 299 Had state officials signed
such a letter, it would call into question the very principle behind the claim – that the letter by
George Washington was the property of the public and was never legitimately owned by the
private party. “The State will not acknowledge ownership of the document,” the Attorney
General informed the attorney for the private party and the parties revised the language
accordingly. 300 The settlement concluded on June 10, 1977, three days before the North Carolina
Supreme Court upheld the state’s ownership of the bills of indictment. 301
As per a request from the counsel for the private party, the state officials agreed that they
would not “initiate any public announcement of the receipt of the document.” 302 News of it,
however, did find its way into the newspapers. One of the accounts provided insight into
arrangement decisions upon the accessioning of the letter, reporting that it would “be filed with
governors’ papers in the State Archives.” 303 This suggests that the aforementioned practice of
segregating the recovered item has more recent origins. Today, the George Washington letter to
the Governor and Council is not housed with the governor’s papers. Instead, it is part of the
Vault, or Treasures, Collection at the State Archives. A description of the replevin case

accompanies the record, reading, “In May 1974 this historic letter was offered for sale by
Sotheby Parke Bernet of New York. Since it is clearly a public record from the files of the
governor, the state took legal action to recover it. In an out of court settlement, the letter was
returned to North Carolina and the North Carolina State Archives by an anonymous donor in
1977.” 304
The state could only suppose when and how the letter came to be out of state custody. 305
This did not hinder its success in court. With State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr., however,
the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the issue of “when” a public record left government
custody matters little. The government in common law jurisdictions are not held to any statutes
of limitations. This is the doctrine of null tempus occurrit regi, a doctrine that supports the state’s
ability to recover public records at any point in time. The case also enhances an understanding of
replevin and ownership in North Carolina with what it reveals about the burden of proof. With
this successful settlement and the court opinion in the case against B.C. West Jr., the state shifted
the burden of proving ownership rights to the private party in possession of the item. The
absence of an authorized transfer from the General Assembly or the North Carolina Historical
Commission is sufficient evidence that the record belongs to the state. Conversely, in
Pennsylvania and Virginia, the inability to explain how a record escaped a government office can
halt recovery efforts before they begin.

In 1861, Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy, wrote to North Carolina Governor John
W. Ellis on the matter of securing machinery for artillery assembly. Centuries later, in 2004, the
letter was advertised in a catalog for a North Carolina-based auction house. The discovery of the
item’s location came from the outside, from an archivist at a North Carolina university who
contacted an archivist at the State Archives. 306 The day following the university archivist’s alert,
the archivist who received the call was able to provide the Assistant State Archivist with his
initial findings from his identification research. Again, the pace is of note; the State Archives
took immediate action following the discovery, demonstrating that the Department of Cultural
Resources prioritizes replevin matters and the responsibility of making records available to the
public.
The Governors’ Letter Books, described by the current Deputy Secretary of Cultural
Resources as a “secret weapon” for the state’s identification research, proved valuable in
demonstrating that the Governor Ellis’s office had indeed received the letter. 307 In accordance
with the aforementioned legislative requirement, correspondence received and mailed by the
Governor’s office was recorded and transcribed by a clerk. The archivist located the letter in
Ellis’s letter book, prompting him to report, “There is no question but that the letter was received
by Governor Ellis and at one time formed part of the archives of his administration.” 308
In his memo to Assistant State Archivist Jesse R. Lankford, the archivist who received
the discovery call reported that records Ellis received “in his public character” found their way
into the archival collections of other institutions following his death. Nearly forty letters and

telegrams received in his capacity as Governor were accessioned into the War Department
Collection of Confederate Records at the National Archives. 309 He cited twenty-five more
telegrams sent to and received by Governor Ellis that were in the collection of the Confederate
Museum in Richmond and two letters in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania’s collection.
These records were among those that Ellis’s clerk transcribed in the letter book, but these records
were not among those that the Department of Cultural Resources was interested in pursuing. 310
The concerns that Duke University and the American Library Association expressed in their
amicus curiae briefs in State of North Carolina v. B.C. West Jr. were not realized. The
Department of Cultural Resources never had an intention of claiming records that were already
part of institutional archival collections. The Department officials were instead concerned about
the letter that was not available for research and instead poised to be purchased by a private
collector.
Negotiations began when the state made contact with the auction house. While the
auction house president was agreeable to working with the state, fear that the record would be
sold prompted the State to petition the court to seize the letter while a custody determination was
reached between parties. This followed the process that is codified in section 132-5.1 of the
North Carolina General Statutes. In their petition to the court, the Department of Cultural
Resources officials, led by Deputy Secretary Jeffrey J. Crow, maintained that “there was real
danger that the public record will be sold, secreted, removed out of the State or otherwise

309
Stevenson explained that at the conclusion of the Civil War, the War Department took custody of records in the
southern states in order to learn about “participation in rebellion, and especially armed rebellion.” The Ellis records
are among those that entered the custody of the federal agency at that time.

disposed of so as not to be forthcoming to answer the final judgment of the Court.” 311 The court
granted the petition and directed the sheriff in the county where the record was located to “seize
immediately the public record…and deliver it forthwith to the court.” 312 The Department of
Cultural Resources did not petition the court to seize the document in order to penalize the
private party or auction house. Instead, it was a precautionary measure to halt the auction. With
the seizure, the court held physical custody of the record until the matter was resolved

313

A seizure does not equate to an unwillingness to work with the private party to reach a
settlement. Prior to submitting the petition to the court, the Special Deputy Attorney General
spoke with the auction house president, who inquired whether the Department of Cultural
Resources would be interested in settling the case. The legal counsel recorded in her notes, “I
told him that the legislature encourages settlements, and, that although I would need to speak
with my client, I didn’t think they would object to sitting down to discuss this (though I didn’t
say they would be willing to discuss paying money to get the letter back).” 314 Even in instances
when the court system becomes involved by ordering the seizure of an item until custody is
determined, her response reveals that the Department of Cultural Resources prefer, whenever
possible, to come to a settlement with the party rather than to turn the decision over to a judge.
This case again calls into question the division between public archivists and private
manuscript collectors and dealers. The auction house president was, in fact, conciliatory when
the state first contacted him, informing the Special Deputy Attorney General that “his goal was

to see that the letter went to the rightful owner.” 315 Given his willingness to negotiate, he
expressed indignation when the state decided that the state viewed a seizure as a necessary
action. Upon the involvement of the court, the auction house president assumed a more defensive
position, but still demonstrated a willingness to cooperate with the state. He indicated that the
Manuscript Society offered to commit financial support through its replevin fund and stated,
“The consigner strongly believes that his ownership position would be upheld in the event this
situation is litigated. He understands the State of North Carolina equally believes in their
position. Therefore I have received authority from my consigner to attempt a negotiated
resolution, which could greatly reduce the time, effort and aggravation associated with a
litigation solution.” 316 What followed was an agreement that included the following terms: the
private party would “donate” the Jefferson Davis letter and all rights to it to the state of North
Carolina. The private party would be responsible for securing a financial appraisal of the item
for the purposes of a desired tax deduction. This is in contrast to the case involving the George
Washington letter, in which the state agreed to provide funds for the appraisal. The state agreed,
with the custody resolution, to withdraw all litigation against the consignor and the auction
house, and all parties asserted that, by signing the terms of agreement, the matter was closed. 317
The state recovered the letter, but it was segregated from the executive papers of the Ellis
administration – closer in proximity than those Ellis records in the collections of NARA and the
Historical Society of Pennsylvania, but still separated. The record joined the Vault Collection, as

is the practice for records once out of custody of the state. Unlike the George Washington letter,
there is no indication in the catalog entry for the item that this was once out of custody. 318
The case of the Jefferson Davis letter to Governor Ellis follows a common narrative of
replevin cases in North Carolina. It begins with an individual outside of the State Archives
bringing the record to the attention of the state and it concludes with the record accessioned in
the Vault Collection at the State Archives. It transforms, however, the perception of replevin as a
consistently divisive issue within the records community. Instead, cooperation is strongly present
in this story. An observant university archivist called a state archivist’s attention to the record, an
act that would have likely surprised the Department of Cultural Resources decades before when
Duke University was among the vocal objectors to the replevin efforts of the state. The auction
house president was receptive to the concerns of the state and, though miffed by the state’s
seizure of the letter, was willing to mediate between his client and the Department of Cultural
Resources to avoid litigation. The Deputy Director of the Department of Cultural Resources
made a concession by acknowledging the letter as a donation, thereby rewarding the private
party in a small way for his cooperation in the matter.

The General Assembly Secession Document
The case involving a record of the General Assembly is notable for the compromises present in
the negotiation and custody determination stages. The record in question, now part of the Vault
Collection at the State Archives, “documents the North Carolina General Assembly’s discussion
of secession from the United States in the earliest days of the Confederate movement then

sweeping through the Southern states.” 319 A former administrator at a nonprofit educational and
lobbying organization contacted Jeffrey J. Crow with “another” lead, suggesting that this
particular external party had brought records to the attention of the Department of Cultural
Resources in the past. 320 An hour and a half after the external party sent his email, Crow issued a
message to the Department’s legal counsel: “Clearly we need to pursue this posthaste.” 321 It is
yet another example of immediate action by the Department of Cultural Resources.
The records for this particular case provide limited insight into the identification research
that the staff at the State Archives conducted and the rationale behind Crow’s blunt assertion that
the Department “clearly” had to take action and recover the record. The selection decision can
only be inferred from a consideration of the record’s provenance and context. It certainly has
value as evidence of the North Carolina legislature’s discussions in advance of the decision to
secede from the Union. A study of the existing record groups at the State Archives reveals that
the state’s identification of this particular record as “archival” is unsurprising. General Assembly
resolutions, both historical and contemporary, are part of the General Assembly Record Group at
the State Archives and, specifically, the Session Records series. 322
With this particular record, an annotation the verso captures how it escaped government
custody. It reads, “Taken from the Hall of Records, Raleigh N.C. on the 15th day of April 1865
by Capt. S.B. Wheeler, A.A.A.G. 3d Brigade, 2d Div., 20 AC.” 323 The legal counsel for the
Department of Cultural Resources cited this passage as evidence that the record was removed

illegally from a government office. She cited government President Abraham Lincoln’s General
Orders 100, also called the Libber Code of 1863, and suggested that the presidential directive
prohibited theft and looting by soldiers. 324 Like the case of the Jefferson Davis letter, however,
the argument for state ownership was focused on the applicability of the statutory definition of
“public record” to the item and the absence of “specific consent of the State General Assembly”
of the transfer of the record, a requirement under section 121-5(b) of the General Statutes. 325
As is common in replevin cases, the legal counsel for the auction house responded with
the assertion that his client was a “good faith purchaser … and therefore owns all rights, title and
interest in the document.” 326 Although the Department of Cultural Resources could have cited
the court opinion in State of North Carolina v. B.C. West Jr. that established there could be no
bona fide purchaser of a North Carolina public record, the auction house demonstrated a
willingness to cooperate. If the Department of Cultural Resources would agree to acknowledge
the donation of the record, the auction house would transfer ownership of the item. Here,
Honoree’s incidents of ownership and the broader “bundle of rights” conception of property are
relevant. It can be inferred that the auction house leadership viewed themselves as having the
“power to alienate the thing” through sale, gift, or destruction. 327 From the perspective of the
Department of Cultural Resources, the auction house had no rights to the record; all rights
belonged to the public.
324
A review of the General Orders 100 questions the applicability of the directive to this case. While the Orders
prohibit the seizure of private property in “charitable” institutions such as churches, schools, libraries, and museums,
the Orders provide that “a victorious army appropriates all public money, seizes all public movable property until
further direction by its government” (Article 31). See General Orders No. 100: The Lieber Code, prepared by

It is evident, however, that the state officials viewed the actual transfer of the record as
more important than the semantics associated with it. Although the current leadership at the
Department of Cultural Resources avoids the term “donation” when reaching a settlement
agreement a private party, neither Crow nor the Department’s legal counsel challenged the
language that the auction house’s attorney used. The Special Deputy Attorney General instructed
the auction house’s attorney that “whether or not the gift is, in fact, tax deductible is a matter
outside of the authority or control of the Department of Cultural Resources” but agreed that the
state would provide an acknowledgment of the donation. 328 In the acknowledgement letter,
which formally documented the custody determination, Crow expressed appreciation for the
donation, writing, “Thank you for returning this piece of history to the people of the State of
North Carolina.” 329 Crow’s recognition of the donation implies a few things, namely, that the
record was once in public custody and that the owners of the letter are the people of North
Carolina. It does, however, appear to suggest that the auction house had the right to voluntarily
choose to gift the letter to the Department of Cultural Resources. This concession was a practical
way in which the matter could be closed.

Dallas-based auction house. 330 It was not an employee of the North Carolina Department of
Cultural Resources who made the discovery, but rather a private citizen who demonstrated an
aptitude for identifying a public record and who further understood that this state agency is the
rightful custodian of a public record. The informal way in which the author addressed Crow
suggests that the two men were familiar with one another. Like a member of a neighborhood
watch, he saw a problem and alerted the appropriate official. It does not appear that the
concerned citizen expects anything in return, but was instead acting in the best interest of the
public.
Crow initiated the state’s replevin process by forwarding the discovery email to the State
Archivist and the Special Deputy Attorney General, an action that reveals who the central
players were in the state’s replevin activities in 2008. He provided the beginnings of the state’s
efforts to identify the item as a public by studying the image on the auction house website.
Although he says that it is difficult to be certain, the item appeared to be a record from the first
state assembly in 1777; the General Assembly was established by North Carolina's state
constitution in 1776 and first convened in April 1777. 331 The speed in which Crow reacted to this
lead is particularly suggestive of the fact that replevin is a priority of the Office of Archives and
History. The concerned citizen emailed Crow at 7pm on the evening of January 31, 2008. Crow
sent his reactionary email the following morning, at 8:30am. 332
Crow made the first contact with the auction house holding and identified himself upfront
as the “legal custodian” of the records of the state. This notice has a marked similarity to the

approach seen in the cases of Pennsylvania and Virginia in that the Deputy Secretary refrained
from issuing any legal threats at this time. He wrote, “Before involving the State Attorney
General’s Office in this matter, I am writing to formally request” the return of the item. 333 He did
not cite legal consequences, provided for under sections 132-5 and 132-5.1 and, instead, thanked
the auction house president for the cooperation he anticipated receiving. 334 The central argument
in the state’s negotiations of this case was that there was an absence of an authorized transfer of
the item to the party in possession it. Empowered by statute, Crow informed the auction house
that “Neither the General Assembly nor the North Carolina Historical Commission, which has
the statutory authority to deaccession public records with historical value, authorized the removal
of the 1777 manuscript from the State Archives.” 335 Thus, it belonged in the custody of the
Department of Cultural Resources.
While staff in the State Archives gathered additional provenance and contextual
information about the document and provided it to Crow, the auction house was, from the
vantage point of the Department of Cultural Resources, considering the request. The Special
Deputy Attorney General said that if the records documenting this replevin case suggested that
there was a “pregnant pause” following Crow’s demand letter, this is because there was. 336 On
April 8, 2008, Crow emailed the State Archivist and the Special Deputy Attorney General and
reported that he had received the requested letter from the auction house. 337

This case is an example of a replevin case that involved no concessions on the part of the
state and no objections from the private party in possession of the record. The auction house’s
legal counsel did not send a letter asserting the private property rights of the consignor. The
custody determination came with the arrival of the letter at the Department of Cultural
Resources. The quiet nature of this case challenges the an assumption that North Carolina’s
replevin efforts are as controversial today as they were when the Department of Cultural
Resources took West to court. There is an ease that characterizes the state’s ownership claim in
this case, suggesting that perhaps its “dogged” reputation for recovering records – and its success
in doing so -- discourages private parties to resist ownership claims and instead elicits
cooperation.

IV.E. SUMMARY
The State of North Carolina is a notable player in the story of replevin of public records. With a
favorable opinion secured with the case of State of North Carolina v. B.C. West Jr., fellow public
archivists took notice. James B. Rhoads, then Archivist of the United States, wrote to State
Archivist Mitchell to offer his congratulations and to express hope that the state of North
Carolina’s success would support recovery efforts in other jurisdictions. 338 David Gracy, then at
the Texas State Archives, wrote to Mitchell to report a successful recovery in the months that
followed the decision regarding the bills of indictment. “The manuscript dealer in Massachusetts
has returned to us (he calls it a donation) the Stephen F. Austin letter I wrote you about a couple
of weeks ago,” Gracy wrote, “I don’t know whether the West case figured in the dealer’s

decision, but I am glad we have the verdict on the books.” 339 In Chapter Five, a Pennsylvania
state official’s use of the court opinion to bolster his claim proved successful at the time. The
long-lasting influence of a decision in one state for another jurisdiction, however, is discussed
further in the following chapter.
Even in North Carolina, the specter of the B.C. West decision appears to have waned. In
the replevin cases resolved in the past decade, state officials did not reference the court opinion
in State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. Instead, the demand letters that the state issues at the
start of the replevin negotiations include arguments for ownership that are based on the North
Carolina Code of Statutes, namely the sections that define public record, codify the procedure for
transferring a record to a private party, and that name the Deputy Secretary as legal custodian.
These, interestingly, are elements that are common to public records statutes throughout the
states, as Bain exhibited in his article “State Archival Law: A Content Analysis,” a piece that
would benefit from updating. 340 This raises a question: what exactly is needed for a state to have
a successful replevin program? While the statute and case law should not be discounted, the
strong commitment of the Department of Justice in North Carolina is a factor that distinguishes it
from the environment present in the chapters that follow. Since the 1970s, the Department of
Justice, led by the Attorney General of the state, has demonstrated a willingness to invest
resources into recovering public records. This remains the case today. The current legal counsel
for the Department of Cultural Resources has not only represented the agencies in several cases,
including the notable recovery of the state’s copy of the Bill of Rights, but has also presented on
replevin at public events and professional meetings.

Still, for a state, a favorable court opinion can support its future recovery efforts,
especially those that reach litigation. One that favors the private party’s possession, however, can
do the opposite. With State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr., public officials were cognizant
of the risks. Price, the former assistant director of the North Carolina Division of Archives and
History worried that the suing for the return of the Hooper indictments could, if unsuccessful,
damage the state’s ability to recover the record it really wanted for the archives: the George
Washington letter. Mitchell viewed the suit against West as strategic; the state, he believed, had a
strong case, would be successful in court, and then use the success as leverage in the George
Washington letter case. 341 Mitchell viewed the West suit as strategic; the state, he believed, had a
strong case, would be successful in court, and then use the success as leverage in the George
Washington letter case. 342 Mitchell was right. The case law precedent helped with bringing
conclusion to that case and presumably would help again if another matter reached the courts.
Price’s concerns, however, have merit, as evidenced by the effects of Middlesex County
et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store on Virginia’s contemporary replevin
activities, discussed in Chapter Six. When deciding whether to ask the court to determine
ownership, a state archives must weigh the importance of the record against the potential impact
of a court opinion that favors the private party. Alternatively, if the private party demands
payment for the record, the state archives may decide that this cost is lower than the potential
cost of taking the matter to court and losing; the Library of Virginia, for example, employs this
reasoning. This discussion contributes to an understanding of why a state archives may choose to
settle an ownership dispute with a private party. This route is, simply, less of a gamble for the
state.

The cases and evidence examined above offer some insight into those records that the
state is most likely to pursue through an ownership claim. First, records that are in the hands of
an individual or an auction house are more likely to be targeted than those in a repository. While
replevin is commonly conceived as an issue that divides public archivists and private collectors
and dealers, a study of North Carolina archival and court records reveals that in the case of B.C.
West Jr., there were additional groups on the opposing side that included members of the
American Library Association and university archivists. The American Library Association’s
legal counsel expressed concern to the court that “The decision of the Court of Appeals would
appear to cloud the title of every library in North Carolina and to the public records and
documents in these collections. If the decision is upheld by this Court, its impact would not be
confined to North Carolina but would extend to other states who might be influenced by the
precedent.” 343 It did not. As the Jefferson Davis case illustrates, known public records in
institutions both within and outside the state are untouched. The reality that these institutions are
caring for the records and making them available for research is one likely source of the state’s
disinclination to engage in replevin efforts.
Another likely reason behind the state’s indifference regarding the records in existing
collections is what Frank Boles and Julia Marks Young describe as reflection on the
“implications of the appraisal recommendations” and, namely, the “political considerations.” 344
The officials at the Department of Cultural Resources and the legal counsel may be concerned
about maintaining relationships with the archival community and entities like the American
Library Association, once an outside critic of the state’s replevin efforts. Concern about

overreaching is, this dissertation found, present in the minds of public officials in each of the
jurisdictions.
In the Superior Court’s hearing of State of North Carolina v. B.C. West Jr., Mitchell
conveyed a policy of the State Archives that may influence replevin selection decisions. At the
time of his testimony, his office would not authorize the destruction of records that predate
1800. 345 This retention policy identifies records created prior to this date as archival and, thus,
likely interests for the Department of Cultural Resources should one be discovered in private
hands. Mitchell was testifying at a hearing that concerned ownership of two records that fall into
this category. Two of the four cases considered in section IV.c. similarly targeted 18th century
records, further suggesting that records of a particular age are of interest to the state.
Of course, it is not the age alone of a record that determines its value. This was made
apparent in January of 2014, when the Department of Cultural Resources responded to media
coverage regarding the destruction of a collection of records that was discovered in the basement
of a county courthouse and that included papers dating from the 1880s. In explaining the
decision, State Archivist Sarah Koonts said that the State Archives advised the local officials in
the county to consult the relevant records schedules. Those records that were past their retention
period, and thus not archival, were approved for destruction. 346 High replevin targets in North
Carolina are any records that retention schedules identify as permanent; not all “old” materials
may be considered permanent. This is a consideration of what Boles and Young characterizes as

the “value-of-information.” 347
A fourth category of records that the State Archives prioritizes in recovery efforts include
records that directly relate to the existing collection. The presence of records with the same
provenance in the state’s collection is justification for the state’s claim that an alienated record
belongs in state custody. While Mitchell confessed that he was interested in the Salisbury bills of
indictment because their recovery would be leverage in regaining the George Washington letter,
he and his staff argued that the bills belonged with the Salisbury court records in the collection
so that researchers could view them within this context.348 The recovery of records that fill a gap
in the evidence is, in all three states examined in this dissertation, an aim.
During the court case against West and the episode involving the George Washington
letter, members of the Manuscript Society and media outlets focused on the ethics and legality of
the position that Robert House first espoused: that the state would not purchase alienated
records. 349 This objection recalls discussions about an unconstitutional government taking, or a
governmental seizure of private property for public good without compensation. The state is
mindful, as discussed above, of asserting the public ownership of the records they claim and
refraining from an acknowledgement that the private party ever owned the materials. In the case
involving the First State General Assembly Document, Crow wrote to the president of the
auction house and maintained: “Public records created by North Carolina government agencies
are the property of the people of the State of North Carolina. North Carolina General Statute
section 121-5(b) prohibits the transfer of title to a public record to anyone, including a bona fide

Assembly…Under these circumstances, the property law of this State considers the possessor of
the manuscript to be a converter.” 350 A “converter” describes a party who is guilty of conversion,
the unlawful withholding or use of property belonging to another. 351
As the cases above illustrate, today’s private collectors and auction houses are largely
cooperative in their responses to the state’s replevin claims, most likely the consequence of the
state’s reputation and success in such cases. Some private parties, however, suggest that they will
elect to donate the record in question to the State Archives. In such instances, neither the state
nor the private party in such cases fully acknowledges the ownership rights of the other. In the
few cases when the state recognized a transfer as a “donation,” there was arguably some blurring
of the line that divides public and private property. Individuals, of course, cannot donate
something that never belonged to them; they do not possess those rights. It is a compromise,
however, that can help both parties avoid litigation and the costs associated with it. Such a
solution has not influenced the state’s strength in recovering alienated records. The Department
of Cultural Resources and the State Archives have a number of tools that work to their favor: a
history of and reputation for successes, a strong public records statute that includes civil and
criminal remedies for recovering property, a case law that could be drawn upon in court, and,
perhaps most importantly, a collection of staff who are committed to reuniting the people of
North Carolina with their property.

V. THE PENNSYLVANIA CASE

“Private citizens ought not be involved in the sale or purchase of public records…I hope you
understand that the Commonwealth cannot set a precedent to purchase the records of its
political subdivisions.”352
In this dissertation on replevin, the selection of the Pennsylvania State Archives as a case was
motivated by the absence of environmental factors. The researcher anticipated that its absence of
a replevin statute and absence of replevin case law would serve as a foil for the environment that
exists in the State of North Carolina. This chapter is the second of three that examines the
replevin process at a government archives. For this particular case study, archival records and
interviews with individuals who represent two eras of leadership at the Pennsylvania Historical
and Museum Commission (PHMC) were particularly important in building an image of replevin
activities and the replevin processes in Pennsylvania.

V.A. THE MEANING OF PUBLIC RECORD IN PENNSYLVANIA
The starting point for the discussion about replevin is, as in the previous chapter, the meaning of
“public record” in the state. This section points to differences among categories of public records

collectors, September 8, 1983; Ben Yarosz file; unaccessioned records of the PHMC, Harrisburg, PA.

124

and probes what these differences mean for replevin actions. While the archival community
associates replevin with the recovery of public records in private hands, it is more appropriate
and correct to conceive of replevin as the recovery of selected public records in private hands. It
is not the case that the Pennsylvania State Archives either has the authority or the interest in
targeting all government records that are outside of government custody.
There are a number of statutes that address the management of public records in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with the Administrative Code of 1929, the History Code, the
County Records Act of 1963, and the Municipal Records Act of 1968 among the most relevant
pieces of legislation. Within this set of laws, the County Records Act and the Municipal Records
are the most overt in their defining of “public record” on a local level. 353 The clearest and most
direct definition of public record in the context of the business of the state government is located
in Management Directive 210.5 Amended: The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania State Records
Management Program. The aim of the Management Directive, issued by the Governor of
Pennsylvania’s Office of Administration, is “to establish policy, responsibilities, and procedures
for the State Records Management Program,” guidelines that are intended to support conformity
to the law and public employees’ understanding of proper records management practices. 354

County Records Act of 1963, 16 P.S., § 13001-13006 (1963); Municipal Records Act of 1968, 53 PA C.S.A., §
1381 – 1389 (1968). The County Records Act of 1963 defines “country records” as follows: Municipal Records Act
of 1968 defines “public record” as “Any papers, dockets, books, maps, photographs or other documentary materials,
regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received in any office of county government in pursuance of
law or in connection with transactions of public business in the exercise of its legitimate functions and the discharge
of its responsibilities.” § 1382 of the Municipal Records Act defines “public records” as “any papers, books, maps,
photographs or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an
entity under law or in connection with the exercise of its powers and the discharge of its duties.” The latter definition
contrasts with its predecessor in the County Records Act and the definition in the Management Directive 210.5
Amended in that its use of the phrase “entity under law” is, in the view of this author, less clear as a descriptor for a
government entity.
354
The Office of Administration is a Pennsylvania state agency that provides “responsive business support” to
employees in its fellow state agencies. Among this support is the provision of guidance on records management to
state employees in the form of management directives and manuals. See “Records and Directives,” Pennsylvania
Office of Administration, accessed October 11, 2013,
http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/records___directives/484; Pennsylvania Office of

125

It defines a state agency record as “information, regardless of physical form or characteristics,
that document a transaction or activity of an agency and that is created, received or retained
pursuant to law or in connection with a transaction, business or activity of the agency.” 355 For the
employees of the Pennsylvania State Archives, this is the definition of record that guides their
actions.
Section 524 of the Administrative Code of 1929, which was added in 1937 and amended
in 1947, created three types, or states, of public records: records that are active and necessary for
government operations, records that are not permanent and that the PHMC authorizes for
destruction, and records that the PHMC determines are no longer active but of long-term
value. 356 There is “nothing in that scheme,” a Commonwealth judge observed, that “provided for
private ownership of public documents.” 357 This interpretation is in line with the principle of
inalienability. Under a strict interpretation of the Administrative Code, a private party cannot
hold title to a record created by the state.
There is a fourth category of public or government records that falls outside of the
PMHC's purview. Licenses, deeds and outgoing correspondence from a public official to a
private party, Haury notes, are representative of these record types. The Commonwealth, for
example, licenses plumbers and maintains a record of this action. The licenses themselves
become the property of the licensed individuals. In considering whether these licenses retain
their status as “government records,” Haury suggests that this would be dependent on “whether

possession enters into the definition.” 358 In his capacity as State Archivist, his interpretation is
this: the issued records are neither archival nor the government’s property. Instead, the
Commonwealth is the owner of the license book or ledger; this is the record that is subject to
retention and disposition schedules. If the book or ledger escapes the custody of the state, this
record could be subject to a recovery attempt.
However, there is a connotation surrounding “public record” in Pennsylvania that
contributes to a double meaning. Pennsylvania’s New Right to Know Law, effective January 1,
2009, defines “public record” as:
A record, including a financial record, of a Commonwealth or local agency that:
(1) is not exempt under section 708;
(2) is not exempt from being disclosed under any other Federal or State law or
regulation or judicial order or decree; or
(3) is not protected by a privilege. 359
The act’s use of the term has colored its meaning outside of the statute; David Haury explains
that “public record” is commonly equated with “open record.” In this understanding of “public
record,” records that are restricted by federal law or the exemptions codified by the state’s Right
to Know Law are not public. 360
For the purpose of this chapter, “public record” is synonymous to “government record.”
This is not inaccurate. The Pennsylvania State Archives’ online notice about the sale of records
illustrates the synonymous use of the terms. The page title in the menu reads, “Sale of Public
Records,” while the title on the page itself is “Sales of Government Records.” Two adjacent
sentences on the page further point to the interchangeability of the terms: “Government records
are paid for by public funds and belong to the citizens of the communities that create them. The

sale of public records is an issue that has become problematic in recent years.” 361 Either term,
then, is appropriate in describing recovery efforts in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as
evidenced by the Pennsylvania State Archives’ own usages of both in this context.

V.B. THE REPLEVIN PROCESS IN PENNSYLVANIA
The impetus for the selection of this case was the matter of absence: absence of case law and
absence of statute relating to recovery of government records. Interviews with Roland M.
Baumann, Chief of the Division of Archives and Manuscripts from 1977 to 1987, and David
Haury, the current Pennsylvania State Archivist, reveal that the omission of an explicit reference
to replevin in public records statutes has, in turn, contributed to the absence of a universal
understanding of the term within the PHMC. On how the PHMC defined replevin during his
tenure, Baumann explained, “I can’t say that I went to the Administrative Code of 1929, which
was our Bible, and that there was something there for us to hang on…I would say the PHMC did
not use [the term].” 362 The theme of absence is even more present in Haury’s description of the
PHMC’s contemporary understanding replevin. He maintained, “In some ways, replevin doesn’t
exist in Pennsylvania because we don't have a replevin law. In a technical sense, we don’t initiate
replevin actions because we don’t have a law that defines what it is. In Pennsylvania, it would
purely be a common law issue.” 363 Both remarks suggest that it is statute, a statute that explicitly
speaks to replevin in the context of public or government records, that gives concrete meaning to
the term. Even with the absence of an official or codified understanding of replevin as it relates

to Pennsylvania records, archival records reveal that PHMC employees have and do use the term.
For this reason, this chapter uses the term replevin to describe efforts by the Pennsylvania State
Archives and its parent agency, the PHMC, to recover public records (or, in one instance,
government-owned private records) improperly in the possession of a private party.
Archivists assign the term "replevin" to cases that attorneys may not characterize as such.
Even among archivists, however, the term may have different limits and inclusions. There does
not appear to be a totally consistent definition of replevin that transcends eras of PHMC
leadership. This was made apparent in the interviews with Baumann and Haury, two individuals
who are particularly notable in the story of replevin in Pennsylvania. During his tenure with the
Pennsylvania State Archives, Baumann's use of the term replevin did not exclude the attempts to
recover records that were alienated from the archives as a consequence of theft. 364 For Haury, the
recovery of records stolen from the archives and the recovery of those that escaped government
custody through some other means are different actions. Pennsylvania Archives employees and
private dealers and collectors alike view the former as ambiguous; the private actors generally
recognize the legitimacy of the Commonwealth's claim to the stolen property, even in cases in
which the records had since entered the hands of a party who had no involvement with the theft.
Replevin, Haury said, is a term that encompasses cases in which a government archives seeks to
regain public records that escaped government custody before a transfer to the state repository. 365
This chapter examines the nuances of replevin actions in Pennsylvania through a study
of five cases. There is a general shape to these cases, with the six stages addressed in the
preceding chapter remaining relevant to the discussion (see figure 4). Two Pennsylvania State
Archives leaders, one past and one present, feature particularly prominently in this section.

Baumann, Chief of the Division of Archives and Manuscripts from 1977 to 1987, is notable in
that he looked to the replevin efforts in North Carolina and drew upon the precedent that his
colleagues in the south were setting in an attempt to achieve recovery successes in his own state.
Haury, who became Pennsylvania’s State Archivist in 2004, has distinguished himself as a
notable contributor to the professional and scholarly discussion on replevin; he has presented on
the topic at several conferences and is an oft-referenced voice in Elizabeth H. Dow’s Archivists,
Collectors, Dealers, and Replevin: Case Studies on Private Ownership of Public Documents. 366
Discovery: Discovery is the stage in which a government archives learns of records that
are potentially public in nature and in private custody. In Pennsylvania, there are two primary
ways in which the Pennsylvania State Archives learns of the alienated records. First, a PHMC
staff member may be the first party to observe an out of custody record, generally one that listed
for sale. Today, Haury says, the Pennsylvania State Archives staff “monitor[s] eBay and catalogs
to some degree but not comprehensively.” The case of the Lancaster County Excise Book is an
example of this course of identification; as Baumann recalled, an archivist on staff saw this item
listed in a catalog as an estate auction lot. 367
The second, more common, means of discovery occurs when an external party provides
the Pennsylvania State Archives with a lead. Haury explained, “There are so many people out
there who are buying Pennsylvania state materials and some of them are conscientious enough

that when they see a government document for sale they let us know.” 368 About half of these
public notifications pertain to records of the local government, which the Pennsylvania State
Archives today punts to the county prothonotary, archivist, or local historical society. In these
instances, the contemporary practice is for the Pennsylvania State Archives staff to act as
consultants to the local government employees, advising them on the replevin process that is
followed by state officials. 369 Most of the cases discussed in this chapter illustrate this means of
discovery; in one, the party in the possession of minutes of the PHMC contacted the
Pennsylvania State Archives himself to learn whether the state would be an interested buyer.
Like in North Carolina, there are “conscientious” partners to the state in the collector
community.
Identification: What records, when discovered, may be identified as targets for recovery
efforts in Pennsylvania? In the stage of the replevin process that this dissertation terms the
identification stage, the government archives will first determine whether the record or records in
question are indeed government property. Importantly, there are certain categories of records
that, though produced by the government, are not recoverable. First, as addressed above,
government records that were intended for public dissemination would not be the subjects of a
recovery effort; with their transfer, the records are no longer the Commonwealth’s property, nor
are they archival. If the archives identifies the records as outgoing records of the state, county, or
local governments, it will halt the replevin process at the Identification stage.
There is a second exempt category, one that is aligned with Sparling’s discussion of
neglect and willful abandonment of title to the WPA prints in Chapter 2. 370 The PHMC’s State
Records Management Manual, a publication intended to aid state employees in observing proper

records management procedures, states that when records are authorized for destruction, “the
primary object … is to reduce the information to an illegible condition.” 371 Haury explained that,
for analog formats, this destruction can be achieved by shredding records, an approach that is
preferable to leaving the records “bundled up ... outside the backdoor of the government office
building.” 372 In the latter approach, wherein the records remain intact, Haury says that private
individuals often salvage these discarded records. By discarding the records, the government is
relinquishing its title to them. The Commonwealth, in turn, is unable to reclaim custody and
ownership of the records. Since beginning at the Pennsylvania State Archives in 2004, Haury has
not often encountered state employees discarding records in such a way, but has seen instances
of this action on the county level.
During an interview with Haury, he referenced a case study that illustrates the
implications of this method of disposal for the ownership of the records. He said, “We have one
particular county here [in Pennsylvania] that actually threw away a lot of their one hundred plus
year old records. And they come on the market all the time. And then people say, ‘Aren’t you
going to recover this for the county?’ And we say, ‘We can’t. The county knowingly threw these
away or gave them away.’ ” 373 There is, however, a critical point to acknowledge here. Even if
the Pennsylvania State Archives had the ability to recover the records, it would not act on that
ability. If the records were indeed authorized for destruction, the Pennsylvania State Archives
would have already determined that they were not archival.
There are, then, two categories of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania records that can be
privately owned: those records that the government deliberately issues to private parties and

those records that enter private possession after the government (state, county, or municipal)
deliberately discards of them. The division that can separate archivists from manuscripts
collectors and dealers becomes apparent early in the replevin process, at the Identification stage.
Disparate perspectives surround the legitimacy of government claims to other record types. Dow
speaks to two areas of discord, explaining that “most” dealers and collectors “reject claims
against those materials for which governments can show no evidence that the archives ever held
them.” 374 If the archives is able to produce evidence that demonstrates the records in question
were once in the archives, there is less room for dispute of the government’s ownership.
Dow’s second area of discord relates to the creation date of the disputed record. She
writes, “In light of governments’ poor history of caring for public documents, some dealers take
the position that because the National Archives did not come into existence until 1934, it should
not have the right to lay claim to materials created before then, unless it can prove that the
materials actually made their way into some sort of government repository. They can easily
extend that logic to state archives and their founding dates.” 375 A year that is relevant to this
chapter is 1903; this was when the Commonwealth saw the establishment of the Division of
Public Records as a bureaucratic entity. 376 The recovery of records identified as predating 1903
will be considered in this chapter.
Selection: There are two categories of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania records that can
be privately owned: those records that the government deliberately issues to private parties and
those records that enter private possession after the government (state, county, or municipal)
deliberately discards of them. Beyond these record types, leadership at the Pennsylvania State
Archives use their discretion to select which alienated records the agency will pursue. There is

indeed a selection process here, as the Pennsylvania State Archives does not pursue all
government records in private hands. This stage in the replevin process, then, is characterized as
the selection stage.
Haury, speaking to contemporary replevin efforts, draws a direct link between archival
appraisal and contemporary recovery efforts, explaining, “We have process we go through where
we would look at a record and first establish that it is a government record and then we would do
our normal appraisal. Is it an archival record? Because obviously there wouldn’t be any reason
for the archives to try to recover a record that isn’t archival.” 377 The PHMC reports that less than
five percent of state agency records enter the Pennsylvania State Archives; for the majority of
Commonwealth records, the final disposition is destruction. 378 It follows, then, that officials at
Pennsylvania State Archives have little interest in recovering all records that improperly escape
the government’s custody.
For the Pennsylvania State Archives, working without a case law precedent or statute, the
physical location of the item in question can have a bearing on the negotiations. For Haury, “the
worst scenario of all is if it is an out-of-state dealer who has a document he is selling for a couple
of hundred dollars.” 379 If this individual is unwilling to turn over the document, Haury says it is
unlikely that the Pennsylvania State Archives would be able to persuade the state’s Office of
Attorney General to pursue legal action against the out-of-state party. Pessimism about the
outcome, the consequence of the absence of relevant legislative enactments and judicial
opinions, is one factor that would contribute to this anticipated reluctance.

The determination as to whether records are archival is tied to an evaluation of their
continuing value for research. 380 The archival community has decidedly separated archival
appraisal from the popular understanding of appraisal as monetary valuing; research value cannot
be judged in dollars or, as Richard J. Cox succinctly remarks, “the market is hardly rational, and
financial worth does not equal historical worth.” 381 Still, the financial element does creep into
selection decisions pertaining to replevin actions in Pennsylvania at times, largely when it is
necessary to obtain the approval of government officials outside of the PHMC to pursue legal
action. Haury explained, “Depending on the situation – and I have to say, all of these are case by
case – the nuances vary considerably as to who we’re dealing with and … [whether it is] a $200
document or a $2,000 document and that has a huge bearing on whether we are willing to pursue
litigation to get it back.” 382 Because it would be necessary to invest resources to hire an attorney
who could work in the out-of-state jurisdiction, the Office of Attorney General would likely
measure the financial value of the record against the resources that would be required to pursue
litigation. 383
The State Archives is unlikely to select a record to pursue if the staff is unable to
demonstrate that it is indeed the government’s property. Moreover, it is unlikely to convince the
Attorney General’s office to enter into litigation if the record is out of state or if the record is of
low financial value. Baumann cites a third source of hesitation at this stage, one related to the

emotional dimension of records recovery. He explained that as a government archivist, “You’re
always concerned about overreaching [in recovery cases]. You’re always concerned that people
may not understand… their own rights, and the role of the public side, like a state archival
agency, in making sure that records aren’t taken like this.” 384
The History Code places "the ultimate responsibility for all government documents" with
the Pennsylvania State Archives. There could be a legal means, Haury said, for the state to claim
a county or municipal record for the State Archives. This, however, is not the typical practice of
the state. 385 The case of Arthur Patterson's excise book is an example in which the Pennsylvania
State Archives seized an item that was a public record, but one that was either a state record or a
county record -- this was a disputable distinction. Although the state was the entity that
interceded and halted the sale, the Pennsylvania State Archives initially placed the book on loan
to the Lancaster County Historical Society before gifting it outright in 2012. 386 While the
Pennsylvania State Archives will assist county officials who attempt to recover local records,
public officials employed by the PHMC prioritize Commonwealth records in the state’s replevin
activities.
Negotiation: Once the Pennsylvania State Archives determines that it will pursue the
record or records, the agency will issue an initial request for the transfer. This is the beginning of
what is termed the negotiation phase in this study. Today, there is a decidedly standard way in
which the Pennsylvania State Archivist initiates the negotiations with the private custodian and
this standard is shaped by the absence of a statute or precedent in the Commonwealth. Because
he does not have a legal basis to cite, Haury said that he first attempts to appeal to the
individual’s concern for the public interest. He informs the party that the “document is part of

Pennsylvania’s heritage” and that it is “best for the public if those documents stayed in one place
and were available to the public.” 387 In the cases analyzed below, it is apparent that Baumann,
too, uses the same tactic in his initial communications with the party in possession of the record.
There is one notable difference in the negotiations that occurred under Baumann’s
leadership and the shape of the process today. As evidenced in the below case involving the
PHMC minutes, Baumann pulled the court decision in State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr.
into his negotiations with the party after the public interest appeal was met with resistance. In
doing so, he used North Carolina’s success to bolster the legitimacy of the Commonwealth’s
replevin request. Today, the case is more removed in time and, as such, less on the minds and
tongues of the records community; collectors and dealers may be less aware of the court opinion
today than they were twenty-five years ago. In truth, its legal reach is restricted to North
Carolina’s jurisdiction; its influence on the ownership of Pennsylvania’s records is null.
Because of the absence of a favorable legal setting for recovery, concessions often arise
within the negotiations with the private party. The most frequent concession is monetary in
nature. The preceding discussion on the selection stage addresses the difficulty of convincing the
officials within the Office of Attorney General to litigate a case in which the record is out of state
and financially. “Our best bet” in negotiating this type of situation, Haury said, is for the
Pennsylvania State Archives to offer to buy the record. Important, however, is the precise
language that both Baumann and Haury used to describe the payment. Haury explained, “Since
we’re buying our own property back, we like to word it that we are providing a finders’ fee
rather than actually buying the document back. Because our claim is that we own it, we don’t
really want to say that we are buying it back. But since they ‘found’ our document, we’ll give

them” a nominal sum. 388 Baumann’s negotiations in the cases of the Baynton, Wharton, and
Morgan papers and the PHMC minutes, described below, exhibit this same avoidance of the
implication that the Pennsylvania State Archives was purchasing another party’s property.
This concession, to offer payment in the negotiation stage, can be situated within the
framework of property theory and government takings. Under the United States Constitution’s
“Takings Clause,” the government must compensate a party if private property is seized for
public use. 389 When the Pennsylvania State Archives chooses to recover a record, it does so
because the Pennsylvania State Archivist and his staff have identified the record to be public
property. The compensation is not made in order to satisfy the constitutional requirement. By
describing the payment as a “finders’ fee,” the Pennsylvania State Archives avoids recognizing
any private ownership of the record. Instead, the language serves as a subtle assertion of the
public nature of the record. Compensation enters the negotiation phase because of a legal
environment, which obstructs the state’s ability to simply demand the record’s return. At this
time, payment is often an inevitable concession if the State Archives wants the record. As the
North Carolina case suggests, the passage of a replevin statute or a favorable court opinion
would likely lessen the necessity and frequency of this negotiation tactic.
Peterson and Peterson cite another concession that may occur in the negotiation stage: the
acceptance of a copy of the record in lieu of the original. 390 Dow explains that there are some
replevin statutes that require the state archivist to recover the original record, but Pennsylvania is
not among those states with this stipulation – or with a replevin law of any kind, for that matter.
For those archivists who are able to accept a copy, Dow says that their decision to do so will be

Commonly referred to as the “Takings Clause,” the final line in the Fifth Amendment states, “Nor shall private
property be taken for public use, without just compensation.”389

based on “1) whether the AG’s [Attorney General’s] office shows an interest in the case, and 2)
the monetary and symbolic value of the document.” 391 Neither interviews with Archives staff
past and present nor the archival records revealed this consideration to be part of the replevin
process in the state of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania State Archives either successfully
recovers the record, or it does not. Haury was unable to recall a case during his tenure in which
the issue of the copy entered into the negotiations with the private party. 392
Difficulties in the negotiation phase can prompt the state to double back to the selection
stage. An example here, one recent to the time of this writing, is a useful illustration. In 2013,
employees of the Pennsylvania State Archives learned that there was an eBay posting for a set of
glass slides dated from the 1940s. An employee of the Turnpike Commission’s publicity office
photographed the construction and early days of the Pennsylvania Turnpike for promotional
purposes and retained them as his personal property. When he died, the photographs were
included in an estate sale and purchased by the individuals who would later place them on eBay.
Recognizing the photographs to be state agency records, the Pennsylvania State Archives
initially attempted to negotiate for the transfer of the photographs but were met with resistance.
The state archivist and his staff determined that while they could continue their efforts and likely
would have a strong case to present in a civil proceeding, the Pennsylvania State Archives
already had very similar photographs in the collection. Haury explained, “They were old and
historical and had archival value. If they hadn’t been duplicates, we would have gone after
them.” 393 In this case, the Pennsylvania State Archives learned of the existence of the
photographs through an eBay posting, decided to seek their recovery, and engaged in discussion
and bargaining with the holders. When it became clear that the individuals were unwilling to turn

over the photographs, the Pennsylvania State Archives staff reappraised the targeted materials.
Based on this reevaluation, the state officials determined that they would not move forward with
the replevin process, which would have involved going to court for the custody determination.
Custody determination: A custody determination may be reached with or without the
involvement of the courts. The latter scenario is the more common. In Pennsylvania, resistance
in the negotiation phase can prompt the Pennsylvania State Archives to reassess the decision to
pursue the record (selection) and, in doing so, lead to a de facto custody determination that
favors the private party. If the Pennsylvania State Archives is successful in negotiating for a
favorable custody determination, it may be accompanied by the negotiated monetary agreement.
The PHMC has taken one dispute to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. The
2009 case of Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, Petitioner v. E.G. Marshall &
Associates, Respondents, analyzed below, illustrates the complexities of the ownership question.
The court did not issue a custody determination; instead, a settlement was reached between
parties. The Pennsylvania State Archives remains without a case law precedent to bolster (or
alternatively, impede upon) the state’s recovery efforts.
Archival Accessioning: If a government archives is successful in recovering an alienated
record, archives staff must decide how that record will integrated into the collection. In North
Carolina, there is a defined practice in place – recovered records are remembered as such by their
arrangement and description. In Pennsylvania, recovered records are generally not segregated
from the original record group and instead rejoin. 394 Haury explained that there might be
instances in which this is not the case, though the recovery effort he cited was a recovery of
stolen property, rather than a replevin case. He referenced a string of thefts that one patron

140

carried out in 1986 and 1987 and said that the Pennsylvania State Archives is “still dealing with
the fallout” of the thief’s actions and discovering stolen records. 395 When records are recovered,
Haury said that the Archives might arrange and describe them in such a way that users are
informed that they had been out of custody. He said, “In general we would try to put the records
back into the same record group and record series, but it might involve filing them slightly
differently to recognize that they’d been stolen. Especially if we had only recovered part of the
record and knew some were still missing, we’d probably want to note in the finding aid: ‘here is
a series of records, here are the records we’ve recovered, [and that] we think some other records
are still missing.’ We’d write that up so that anyone doing research with those records would be
aware that the original order of the series had been tampered with by this thief.” 396 This practice
differs from that seen in North Carolina, where a duplicate is returned to the record group and
original segregated.

V.C. CASE STUDIES OF REPLEVIN IN PENNSYLVANIA
This section examines a series of recovery efforts in Pennsylvania as means for understanding
the replevin process in the state. Archival records and interviews were particularly important data
sources for the discussion and analysis that follows. The selection of these cases was based on
the accessibility of record sources. 397

The researcher submitted a records request in April 2013. The PHMC’s determination is included in Appendix B.
The request was “granted in part and denied in part.” The PHMC determined that the request lacked specificity and
the communication between the PHMC and the Attorney General was exempt based on attorney-client privilege. As
a consequence of this decision, the researcher focused on cases that could be studied through archival records and
interviews.

The Baynton, Morgan, and Wharton Papers and the PHMC Minutes
In June 1977, North Carolina Supreme Court ended the dispute between the state of North
Carolina and manuscripts dealer B.C. West, Jr. by upholding the decision of the appeals court
and finding in favor of state ownership. This dispute, which began in the early months of 1975,
coincided with Roland M. Baumann’s completion of his doctoral degree and his entry to the
archival profession. 398 The court case, he said, sparked conversation about replevin at
professional meetings, particularly at NAGARA, and shaped his own understanding of the
meaning of the term in the context of his work. Informed by the professional conversation and
the precedent set by the State of North Carolina, Baumann successfully embarked on successful
replevin claims in during his employment with the PHMC. 399
Two of Baumann’s cases are discussed in this section, one as a necessary prelude to a
more focused consideration of a second action. They are included in this study for a few reasons.
First, while it is possible that there were prior instances of replevin efforts by the Pennsylvania
State Archives, these are the earliest examples located through this dissertation’s research.
Second, both cases are examples of recovery that occurred outside of courts, with documentation
and interview data helping to reveal a path of identification, selection, negotiation, and outcome.
Finally, these are instances in which a government archivist, working outside of North Carolina,
drew upon and referenced the case law precedent of State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. -and achieved success in doing so.
Baumann’s recollection of his earliest involvement with a replevin case centers on the

consisting of the business records of a colonial Philadelphia trading firm. 400 The subject of an
NHPRC-funded microfilming program in the 1960s, the Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan papers
“fall into the shadowy dividing line between public records and private papers,” a
characterization that evokes the title of Oliver H. Holmes’s 1960 article “ ‘Public Records’ –
Who Knows What They Are?” 401 The blurriness originated with the Commonwealth’s
“sequestration,” or seizure, of the papers for civil proceedings against Peter Baynton, who served
as state treasurer from 1797-1801. 402
Surprisingly, the ambiguity surrounding the public or private nature of these papers,
however, is not the root of the replevin action. As Baumann remembers it, his first replevin case
was a straightforward one. An external party contacted the Pennsylvania State Archives after
seeing that the papers were being sold in a Miami, Florida based auction. 403 Baumann identified
these papers as alienated state property easily: the Pennsylvania State Archives had microfilmed
the Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan manuscript collection and the advertised papers matched
items in the microfilm. Baumann was emboldened by the success in North Carolina and the
Pennsylvania State Archives was able to demonstrate that the papers had been in the collection
and removed without the permission of the state. The papers were returned. 404 Baumann was
able to secure his first replevin success with this case, a success that would influence his decision
to act on recovering the minutes of the PHMC.

The case involving the PHMC minutes began with a phone call. Ben Yarosz, a man
living in Williamsport, PA, contacted the Pennsylvania State Archives and informed Baumann
that he had the board minutes of the PHMC spanning the period of 1924 to 1932 that he would
be willing to sell to the Commonwealth. 405 This is an unusual beginning to a replevin case, with
the party in possession of the records revealing his custody through direct communication with
the state archives. Yarosz’s initial communication suggests that while he recognized that the
records were relevant to the archives, he either did not anticipate that the state would make a
claim or did not view them as the state’s rightful property at the time. Now in his custody,
Yarosz evidently viewed the records as his to possess or to sell. The negotiations that followed
serve as evidence of Yarosz’s resistance to accepting the legitimacy state’s claim.
The Pennsylvania State Archives’ discovery of the alienated records, then, was achieved
through Yarosz’s voluntary contact. As discussed above, once the Pennsylvania State Archives
discovers the records in private custody, the staff must perform an appraisal of sorts, determining
whether the records are government property and, if they are, whether they are archival and
whether to pursue them. As Chief of the Division of Archives and Manuscripts, Baumann was
able to use his own informed discretion in making these decisions. The documentation related to
the replevin cases during his tenure and discussion with Baumann suggest that it was not
necessary for him to obtain the approval of individuals holding other leadership positions within
the PHMC before moving forward with this recovery effort. 406
Conversation with Baumann revealed the motivating factors behind his decision to
recover the minutes in Yarosz’s possession. Baumann, as already stated, was aware of the
replevin activity in North Carolina and informed by the court decision in State of North Carolina
405

144

v. B.C. West, Jr. He had recovered the Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan papers and, as he tells it,
was inspired by his success in doing so in his decision to approach this case. Baumann also
spoke to the responsibility that government archivists have in ensuring that the public has access
to records of the government; in instances in which records escaped public custody “at no fault
of the staff,” recovery is the appropriate action, one in keeping with good stewardship. 407 This
notion of a moral imperative recalls Kevin Cherry’s discussion of what drives replevin actions by
the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources.
The nature of the materials, however, appears to have been the primary factor in pushing
Baumann to move forward with the claim. The Pennsylvania State Archives is an entity within
the larger agency of the PHMC and so there was an absurdity to Yarosz’s phone call and offer to
sell the PHMC minutes. Baumann recalled, “The last thing I want[ed] to do is buy back the
records that rightfully belong to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania – particularly the records of
my own agency. My own agency!” 408 The phone call provoked Baumann’s intent to recover the
materials, but before explicitly claiming them as state property, he requested that Yarosz mail the
minutes to Harrisburg so that the archives could examine them. In his letter to Yarosz following
this initial transfer, Baumann said that the review revealed the records to indeed be public
property. In light of this, Baumann told Yarosz that the Pennsylvania State Archives would offer
him a small honorarium of twenty-five dollars as thanks for bringing the minutes to the state’s
attention. 409 Baumann was soft in his tone but assertive in what he expressed here. He did not
request the transfer of ownership to the state. Maintaining that the minutes are indeed public
records of the Commonwealth, Baumann invited no further negotiation from Yarosz. Instead,

Baumann expressed his appreciation for Yarosz’s “public spirit and interest” in ensuring that the
records were reunited the PHMC minutes already in the collection of the Pennsylvania State
Archives. 410 There was no threat of legal action; the language is conciliatory but expectant. In
this case, negotiation began with Baumann’s direct assertion of state ownership and an expressed
assumption that Yarosz would cooperate. In truth, however, Baumann said that when he made a
claim for a public record or records as a government archivist, he anticipated that a party would
likely defend his or her custody. 411 Still, an invitation for Yarosz to justify his possession would
have decidedly weakened the confidence that is present in Baumann’s letter.
As continues to be a practice today in Pennsylvania, this negotiation stage included
discussion about compensation. Baumann, like his colleagues in North Carolina, was mindful
about avoiding a precedent in which the Commonwealth purchased government records from
private individuals. Baumann’s written correspondence, following Yarosz’s phone call, the
source of the discovery, and the transfer of the records to the Commonwealth for inspection,
stated that the Pennsylvania State Archives would provide Yarosz with $25 as a finder’s fee and
the postage costs incurred in sending the minutes to Harrisburg. 412
Yarosz’s response to Baumann’s initial assertion of state ownership suggests that he
views himself as having an upper hand in the negotiations. Upon receipt of Baumann’s offer of
$25, Yarosz replied, ““At this time I cannot let you have the minutes of [the] Pa. Historical
Commission for $25.00. This item is jointly owned by me and another party. I spoke to him
about the offer [and] he rejected it. An offer of $75 would be accepted by both parties

involved.” 413 An application of Honoré’s incidents of ownership and the broader “bundle of
rights” conception of property suggests that Yarosz continued to perceive himself as having
private property rights and good title of the minutes. At this stage in the negotiations, Yarosz
believes he has what Honoré called right to capital, or “the power to alienate the thing” through
sale, gifting, or destruction. 414
Baumann, however, countered Yarosz’s confidence with a bolder, more direct assertion
of the Commonwealth’s ownership. With his initial communication, Baumann first appealed to
the party’s public responsibility and offered $25.00 in exchange for Yarosz’s cooperation. The
tone of the negotiation stage markedly shifts with Yarosz’s dismissal of the offer. Baumann
wrote,
With regard to the minutes of the Pennsylvania Historical Commission,
please be reminded that you are asking me to purchase records that,
under the law, rightfully belong to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
My offer of $25.00, which is unsatisfactory to you and your partner,
was made with this fact in mind. Dealers need, however, to be made
aware of the broad implications of the recent North Carolina Supreme
Court case, B. C. West vs. State of North Carolina (1976).
At this writing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has not contemplated the
replevin of any documents because most dealers and manuscript librarians in
Pennsylvania have been fairly responsive to this decision. We thought you would
be responsive as well. 415
With this letter, Baumann made clear that there could be legal ramifications for the legal
consequences to Yarosz’s resistance and challenged Yarosz’s perception that he had “right to
capital,” which would enable him to establish the price. Here, Baumann employed the legal
meaning of the term replevin, rather than the more colloquial use of the term within the records
community.

Interestingly, Baumann suggested that the State of North Carolina’s success in court
against the dealer West had broad reach for state archives as a whole and cited the
Commonwealth’s willingness to file a replevin suit and take the custody dispute to court if
negotiations failed. 416 In his reflections today on the case, however, Baumann indicated that
there was some element of bluff behind his assertion, as there was no certitude that the Office of
Attorney General would actually take the matter to court. 417 By pointing to the court decision in
State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr., Baumann, however, raises the question as to whether
state archives can draw upon replevin case law in other states to bolster a claim. In reality, North
Carolina’s success does not establish precedent for other jurisdictions. Under the common law
system and the principle of stare devises, a judicial decision issued by a court must guide future
decisions made by the same a court or lower courts in the same jurisdiction. The ruling in North
Carolina, however, serves as only “persuasive authority,” not “binding authority.” 418 Outside of
the jurisdiction in which a ruling was made, a decision “is only persuasive, to be taken as a
starting point for judicial reasoning so far as it appeals to the court.” 419 Were the PHMC to have
sued Yarosz, there is no certainty that the Pennsylvania court would arrive at the same decision
as the judge in State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr., though the court may have referenced
the decision.

distinction in this way: “A common law system emphasizes consistency and predictability, while also allowing for
modification of rules when necessary. No state law decision is binding on any other state, but it is common practice
for state courts to look to other state courts as persuasive authority. Such decisions can be very influential, especially

There is a lesson to draw from this aspect of the case’s negotiation stage. Even though the
decision in North Carolina does not portend the PHMC’s success in court, Baumann’s allusion
was to the benefit of the negotiations and had value to the PHMC in its efforts to settle the
ownership question with the private party. The confidence that Yarosz demonstrated in his
earlier communication was tapered by Baumann’s more litigious tone. Today, when there is
greater temporal distance separating replevin cases and the court case, a state archives official
may be less inclined to cite the decision or even may be unaware of its relevance. If the state
official outside of North Carolina does indeed reference the nearly thirty year-old court decision,
it is unlikely that it would similarly persuade a private party to transfer the record in question to
the government.
Although Baumann hinted at the Commonwealth’s readiness to go to court should Yarosz
continue to resist, the PHMC also demonstrated a willingness to compromise, to some extent, on
the matter of monetary compensation. Upon learning that Yarosz and another party were in
possession of the minutes, the PHMC raised the finder’s fee, with Baumann asserting, “we are
now prepared to make a final offer of $50.00 for your willingness to bring these records to our
attention. In the event that this amount is unsatisfactory to your and your partner[,] we plan to
deal, for the first time, with the matter of replevin (recovery of public records through legal or
other processes) with the Commission’s Deputy Attorney General.” 420 There is no vacillating
from or weakening of the Commonwealth’s claim to the minutes. The conciliation was couched
in an assertion of potential legal consequences for Yarosz and his partner and the language that
Baumann uses to describe the compensation again avoids the suggestion that the PHMC is
purchasing the minutes from the party.

The parties reached a custody determination, with Yarosz and his partner accepting the
finder’s fee of $50.00 from the Commonwealth in exchange for transferring the minutes to the
PHMC. Yarosz, however, did not relinquish control of the records without criticizing the
government officials’ historic and neglectful treatment of public records. Yarosz wrote, “I will
not question the legal right to the minutes. I only want to say that these minutes would have been
destroyed at least 15 years ago had we not salvaged them. I wish to say that there are a lot of
public records destroyed by careless officials in our government … There seems to be an
indifference to what is and should be kept. I have bought a lot of paper items in my time which
should have been retained by local State and Federal bodies.” 421 He did not chance the
Commonwealth’s threat of legal action by furthering the negotiations and defending his rights to
the minutes. Instead, Yarosz returned the records without a total acknowledgement of the
Commonwealth’s rights to them and with, instead, restrained condemnation of governmental
stewardship of records. To use Honoré’s terminology, the mode of loss and the mode of
acquisition of the minutes are ambiguous. Yarosz implied that the former was the consequence
of agency neglect and that, by acquiring the records, he rescued them from otherwise destruction.
He, however, provided no evidence to support the state’s abandonment of title that would, in
turn, legitimize his rights to the records. 422 Baumann, on behalf of the PHMC, simply thanked
Yarosz for “his role in preserving Pennsylvania’s rich heritage” and does not respond to his
criticism of public records management. 423
With the physical recovery of the records, the PHMC completed the final stage in the
replevin process outlined in this dissertation: archival arrangement. The minutes were integrated
into the record group for PHMC agency records and, specifically, the series titled “Minutes and

Agenda of the Historical and Museum Commission.” While the finding aid does indicate that the
records in this collection came to the Pennsylvania State Archives through different accessions,
there is no indication that the minutes spanning the years of 1924 to 1932 were once outside of
state custody. 424
This was a case in which the Pennsylvania State Archives successfully recovered records,
even though the state officials were unable to track the moment of and circumstances behind the
loss. In contrast to the private party in a later Pennsylvania case involving convict affidavit
books, Yarosz did not resist returning the records on this basis. There is no way of knowing
whether the PHMC would have taken the matter to court if there was resistance, nor if the
agency would have met a favorable outcome if it had. This case falls within the archival
definition of replevin, but Baumann, reflecting years later, characterized his actions more
broadly: he was simply carrying out his responsibility as a public official. The tack Baumann
took in this particular case is in line with his modus operandi when confronted with similar
circumstances. He explained, "I wouldn’t call what I was trying to do other than doing my job,
using persuasion, and letting the person down easily by saying 'we can take care of this between
the two of us and we’re not going public. If you’re a dealer in other stuff, we’re not going to
bother you.' "

During Baumann’s employ, the Pennsylvania State Archives halted an auction sale of a
government record, in the third case of replevin considered in this chapter. In this instance,

deaccession of items in the agency’s care, provide insight into this case. This case is one in
which the Pennsylvania State Archives was successful in exercising its authority as custodian of
public records, despite not having a specific replevin statute to guide its actions. In this alone, it
is a notable case. However, the Pennsylvania State Archives' decision-making following the
recovery is equally notable as it is an instance of cooperative behavior among archival
repositories in appraisal and reappraisal practices.
This case began with the discovery of the alienated record by a third party, though the
source of the tip is not captured in the records. 425 In an undated memo, an associate archivist at
the Pennsylvania State Archives informed Baumann, the Chief of the Division of Archives and
Manuscripts, of an impending estate auction that included what appeared to be Lancaster County
tax records. In the memo chronicling his discovery, the archivist revealed the first steps that
followed his discovery, indicating that he contacted the attorney for the estate after seeing the
advertised lots. This communication can be classified as part of the identification stage of this
replevin case, as the archivist aimed to learn more about the provenance of the records. He
reported to Baumann that the items slated for auction included “a leather-bound volume
identified as the excise tax, 1747-1748. The entries contain the following data: name, amount of
tax, and method of payment. In addition, there are approximately 40 loose slips that contain tax
information.” 426 A February 13, 2012 record identifies Arthur Patterson, a Lancaster-based man
who served as the county collector of excise tax on alcohol, as the volume’s author. 427

Baumann recalled that a Lancaster-based museum alerted the PHMC to the auction. Roland M. Baumann,

As becomes apparent in reviewing the collection management records, the "book of
excise," as the agency calls the volume in question and the papers within, was the subject of a
successful recovery effort by the state. The accession registrar for the excise book reveals that
the PHMC received the item on April 26, 1986, the scheduled date of the aforementioned
auction, and formally accessioned it into the PHMC's collection in July of the same year. At this
time, it joined Record Group 21 (RG-21), the Records of the Proprietary Government. 428 What
the PHMC collection records fail to offer is more information regarding the seizure. It is evident
that individuals at the Pennsylvania State Archives first learned of the impending auction and, as
indicated above, communicated with the attorney with the estate who provided information about
the records but maintained that the sale would continue. 429 There is no indication in this
particular memo that the PHMC intended to recover the records; the memo’s purpose was to
summarize the steps already taken.
There is little evidence that reveals the decision-making behind the seizure and what was
the nature of communications between the PHMC and the private party following the halting of
the sale. Presumably the age of the excise book and its status as a provincial record was a
motivating factor. Just ten years prior, North Carolina was successful in recovering a colonial
record from dealer B.C. West, Jr. and Baumann was aware of this case. If the estate attempted to
dispute the Commonwealth's claim on April 26, 1986, it is not apparent from the records.
The PHMC identified the book of excise as a public record and seized it, but there are
statements within the collections management records that raise questions as to whether the

record should be classified as a record of the state or a record of the county. This ambiguity and
the irrefutable connection between the book of excise and Lancaster County led to a loan
agreement in 1987 between the PHMC and the Lancaster Country Historical Society and the
PHMC’s ultimate donation of the record to the regional historical organization. This is an
instance in which the PHMC acted on both its own behalf and the behalf of the county
government in recovering the record, an act that ultimately was to the particular benefit of the
Lancaster Historical Society.
After recovering the book of excise, the PHMC obtained approval from its legal counsel
to provide twenty-year loan to the Lancaster County Historical Society. 430 The document loan
agreement, in no uncertain terms, maintains that this is local government record. The agreement
reads, "Not only is this a public record for Lancaster County, but also it is in the best interest of
Pennsylvania history and existing institutional relationships to place it at the local level." 431 The
PHMC was evidently focused on what would be the most appropriate repository for the excise
book and most advantageous to the researchers of Lancaster County history. Cooperation, it
appears, trumps the lure of possessing the original colonial record. While the PHMC did not
relinquish title at this time, the agency photographed the book of excise and made it available in
microfilm to researchers at the Pennsylvania State Archives. 432
This is a case in which the state was successful in its replevin efforts in 1987, in spite of
an absence of information about the modes of loss and acquisition. The decisions that followed
the recovery offer insight into the motivations behind the replevin action. The reality that the

PHMC considered what would ultimately be the best repository for the record is suggestive of
the notion that was is not greed but rather a concern for public access that promoted the replevin
actions. F. Gerald Ham, in a speech to the meeting of the American Association for State and
Local History, argued for a “ ‘need to change our perspective, from our egocentric need to build
up our own archival institutions to a common concern to build up information linkages between
institutions.’ ” 433 The actions by the PHMC in the aftermath of the seizure embodies the ideas
that Ham expresses. In 2012, twenty-five years after the recovery of the book of excise, staff at
the PHMC decided that to “make it official and complete the transfer to the LCHS,” gifting the
loan to the historical society. 434

The Harmony Society and Old Economy Village
Unlike the previous cases examined in this chapter, the “mode of loss” and the “mode of
acquisition” are discernible in the archival records. In this section, there is attention given to how
the records got out of custody and how that impacted the state’s efforts to recover them. This is a
case that centers on the custody and ownership of the papers of a religious separatist society, one
that strove to achieve utopia through communal living and is now remembered through the
preservation of a historic site eighteen miles northwest of Pittsburgh. The items in question in
this case are not records created during the transaction of government business. They are not, as
such, public records. Instead, this case focuses on records and personal papers that were created
by members of a religious group. The materials, though originating as private papers, became
government property when the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania acquired them in 1937, an

acquisition described below in further detail. This case, as such, very quickly transforms our
understanding of replevin. The provenance of the Harmony Society papers is private in nature
and, as such, the PHMC appropriately maintains and describes the materials as nongovernmental records. However, the 1937 acquisition rendered these papers as Commonwealthowned property.
Such a case is an anomaly in Pennsylvania. Haury remarked, “This replevin and recovery
– the only time it applies to private papers would be if they already were given to the archives
and someone stole them. And that’s pretty rare.” 435 Still, while the existing archival literature on
replevin, along with the dissertation proposal for this study, uses the term to describe
governmental efforts to recover public records in private hands, this case study suggests that
there are instances in which replevin actions include governmental efforts to recover
government-owned property records in private hands.
The records creators themselves are not the focus of this discussion, but an interesting
backdrop to this case of misplaced trust, a loan, a documentary editor, and recovery. Religious
separatism is a concept introduced to even the youngest of school-aged children in the United
States, who learn, often every November, of the Pilgrims and their voyage to America in search
of religious freedom. John Archibald Bole, author of the 1904 publication titled The Harmony
Society: A Chapter in German American Culture History, characterizes religious separatist
groups as communities that sever ties with an established church. 436 Like the Pilgrims before
them who broke from the Church of England and found a spiritual home in America, the German
followers of pastor George Rapp departed their homeland and settled in Pennsylvania. There, in
February of 1805, the members of the Harmony Society penned and signed the first iteration of

the group’s “articles of association,” a set of agreements that codified a practice of communal
living. 437 Two years later, in 1807, Rapp’s Harmonists decreed that members should live a
celibate existence, with married couples residing together as, essentially, brother and sister. 438
During their active years, the Harmonists met with this prosperity in the three locations that they
made home: Harmony, Pennsylvania (1804 to 1815), New Harmony, Indiana (1815 to 1824),
and Economy (now Ambridge), Pennsylvania (1824 to 1905). 439,440 Rapp, who lived until 1847,
served as the leader of the Harmonists at each of the three sites, but decision-making powers
were also extended to a string of designated trustees. 441 John S. Duss (1860-1951) and Susanna
C. Duss (1859-1946) were the final two individuals to hold trustee positions; the former, an
individual who figures in the story of the alienated records, was the Senior Trustee during the
period of 1892 to 1903, while his wife held the office from 1903 to 1905. 442
Over time, membership in the Harmony Society dissipated dramatically, an unsurprising
consequence of the Harmony Society’s adoption of celibacy. The group, now in single numbers,
formally dissolved in 1905. In 1910, legal proceedings and negotiations commenced to
determine the party or parties that would secure the ownership of the Harmony Society’s
property. In 1919, the state of Pennsylvania procured the Harmonists’ land in Ambridge and

others, John S. Duss and Karl J.R. Arndt, both players in this replevin case study, are additional resources. It is
necessary to note, however, that Reibel and Arndt call into question claims made by Duss, one of the final surviving
members of the Harmony Society, in his The Harmonists: A Personal History (Harrisburg, PA: Pennsylvania Book
Service, 1943).

opened the grounds to the public in 1921. 443 Today, the PHMC continues to administer the
Harmony Society settlement as a historic site named Old Economy Village. 444,
Robert M. Dructor and Roland M. Baumann’s introduction to the Guide to the
Microfilmed Harmony Society provides a historical account of the communal society’s records,
which is useful for its discussion of the Harmonists’ recordkeeping practices and, particularly,
the custodial history of the records. While the state of Pennsylvania acquired the Ambridge land
and buildings in 1919, the records (and artifacts) were a later acquisition, an acquisition that was
likely delayed by John S. Duss’s sense of personal ownership of the records as one of the last
living Harmonists and his desire to have exclusive access to the records until he was able to
publish his memoirs and history of the Harmonists. However, Dructor and Baumann characterize
the 1930s as “an important decade for the records;” 445 it is during these years that there is a
loosening of Duss’s control over the records, though, as this case study demonstrates, this control
is not totally relinquished by John Duss during his lifetime.
When John S. Duss and Susie C. Duss granted an individual permission to borrow
records for Old Economy Village’s publicity purposes in 1921, the loaned materials found their
way into the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania’s collection. The series of negotiations
that followed between John Duss and Solon J. Buck, then Executive Director of the Historical
Society, are a prelude to the character that would mark the records’ custodial history. Duss made
an agreement with Buck that required the return of the records related specifically to the
Harmony Society and the Historical Society’s retention of records that dealt more broadly with

the history of the western region of the state. 446 Most notable in the decade’s occurrences in
relation to the records, however, was the involvement of the Works Projects Administration
(WPA) in their arrangement and preservation. It was the WPA’s work at Old Economy Village,
coupled with the Commonwealth’s appeals, which contributed to the Dusses’ decision in 1937 to
sell the records and artifacts to the Commonwealth at the sum of one dollar. 447 In 1940, the
records on loan to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania were reunited with the others,
now the property of the Commonwealth. 448
Karl J. R. Arndt, then a professor of German at Louisiana State University, entered the
narrative as the WPA project was in residency at Old Economy Village. The scope and content
notes for the Karl Arndt Collection of Harmony Society Materials, now part of the PHMC’s
collection, provide limited insight into the eponymous collector. Arndt was born in 1905,
coincidently the same year of the Harmony Society’s dissolution, and lived until 1991. An
academic with research specialties in utopian communities and German linguistics, Arndt, the

Ambridge, Pennsylvania and microfilmed copies are in Harrisburg.
448
Dructor and Baumann, Guide to the Microfilmed Harmony Society Records, 7. Even with this transfer, however,
Duss continued to feel a sense of ownership over the records. This was evidenced when Margaret Lindsay, leader of
the WPA records project at Old Economy Village, suggested that the Commonwealth had an obligation to make the
Harmony Society records available for researchers’ use. Duss balked, responding, “I note what you write about the
papers being Commonwealth property and the Commission therefore not in position to deny to research applicant
[sic] the privilege of examining said papers. However I happen to be still laboring under the impression that Mrs.
Duss and I have not as yet turned over the collection to the Commonwealth. (I am speaking morally not legally as to
Major Melvin’s [the Chairman of the PHMC] imperfect and misleading contract).” (John S. Duss to Margaret
Lindsay, January 22, 1940, MG-310 John Duss Papers, Box 4 Incoming and Outgoing, Folder 43 Correspondence
Margaret Lindsay, Old Economy Village, Ambridge, PA.) To Duss, the signed agreement did not invalidate his hold
over the materials; “morally,” the papers remained his shared property with his wife, though the papers themselves
documented a community that totaled 1,050 members over its century-long lifetime. (See Bole, The Harmony
Society, 34.). The possessiveness he feels toward the materials is signified in his desired name for the collection. He
corrects Arndt’s reference to the papers, remarking, “Pardon me, but I don’t like the ‘Harmony Society
Archives’…All the books and papers at ‘Old Economy’ were personal property. And, as specified in the contract
twixt the Dusses and the Commonwealth, the entire collection is to be known as ‘The Duss Exhibit.’ ” (John S. Duss

PHMC states in the finding aid, collected the Harmony Society records, “during the course of his
research and publication of documentary histories of the Harmony Society (1805-1905) of
Harmony, Pennsylvania; New Harmony, Indiana; and Economy, Pennsylvania.” 449 It is his role
of collector that makes this figure relevant to the study.
A June 25, 1939 letter from Arndt is among the earliest records in the PHMC collection
that points to his scholarly interest in the documentation of the communal group. Addressed to
the Harmony Society “Custodian of Records,” the letter reveals Arndt’s discovery of records
created by another German separatist group, this one consisting of former Harmonists and
located in Louisiana. Arndt essentially submitted a reference request, asking for information
about the records in Harmony and noting an interest in visiting the site, should there be material
relevant to his scholarship. 450 Arndt’s scholarly curiosity was evidently kindled by the response
he received from John Duss, one of the last living members of the Harmony Society and a
Harmonist leader. He made plans to travel to Pennsylvania that same summer. 451 The
correspondence subsequent to his initial inquiry, however, provides insight into an involved
relationship that Arndt would form with the Harmonist records, a relationship that would move
beyond one in which Arndt saw himself as simply a records user. Upon learning of the holdings
in Harmony, Pennsylvania, Arndt immediately suggested that his knowledge of the German
language might prove to be an asset to Duss and the group convened by the WPA to arrange the
Harmonist records. 452 Arndt would later stress to his readers the instrumental role he played in
the efforts to organize the Harmonist materials. His hands, time, and expertise were lent to the

“Manuscript Group 437.”

early efforts to process the papers, which likely served to legitimize his later expressions of
perceived ownership of them.
Arndt did not delay in requesting physical custody of the original Harmonist records for
use in his research. In October 1939, Arndt wrote to Duss and said that while he had
commissioned photographs of records taken in Pittsburgh, the quality was such that the
surrogates were of no use to him. Awaiting the arrival of re-developed photographs from
Pittsburgh, Arndt writes to Duss, “I wonder whether you could not arrange to have the
manuscripts sent here [Louisiana State University] so that I may use them here? I am still hoping
that I will get the photographs, but if the new photographs are as dark as those that I have[,] it
will be impossible to read them. I fully appreciate the value of manuscripts, but I do believe they
ought to be used by those who can read them in the original.” 453 Duss expresses regret that
Arndt’s photographs are illegible but replies that he does not have the necessary “authority” to
send the originals. He was pessimistic that Arndt will be successful in this request, remarking, “I
doubt your being able to secure permission to have them sent.” 454 Duss proved to be incorrect in
his prediction; with State Historian S.K. Stevens as an advocate, Arndt was able to arrange for
the PHMC to loan the records in 1940. This transfer was the mode of loss for the PHMC and the
mode of acquisition for the scholar.
“Hand in glove. It was all hand in glove stuff,” said Roland M. Baumann, of the loan
agreement between the Pennsylvania Historical Commission and Arndt. 455 The Harmony Society
records strayed from government custody directly because of special privileges that Stevens,
along with WPA project director Margaret Lindsay, extended to Arndt. Documentation that

There is a definite suggestion that the curator at Old Economy Village thought the loan would
cultivate a relationship with Arndt, a potential donor. Lindsay wrote to Stevens, “I’m very
anxious that Dr. Arndt feel disposed to deposit his collection of books and papers discovered in
Louisiana with us rather than with a library where they will not have such a close relationship to
materials on hand. I know that Dr. Arndt feels inclined to do this at the moment and would not
care to see him change his mind.” 457 It is likely that there were dual motives at play for lending
Arndt the papers: for Stevens, he was helping a fellow historian move forward with his research,
for Lindsay, she was nurturing a relationship with a party who possessed a rich record collection
that was relevant to the historic site.
The literature pertaining to archival theft points to the perils of extending privileges to
trusted researchers. Charles Merrill Mount, who was arrested and tried in the 1980s for stealing
manuscripts valued at more than $100,000 from the Library of Congress and NARA, used
friendships with staff and a resultant insider status to secure special accommodations; his
belongings, for example, were not inspected by Library of Congress guards, who were told by
staff that Mount was “ ‘okay.’” 458 Unlike Mount, Arndt did not hide the Harmony Society
records under his clothing in order to remove them from government custody. Like Mount, he
Interestingly, the site administrator at Old Economy Village was unaware that there was documentation of the
loan between the Pennsylvania Historical Commission and Karl J.R. Arndt. She requested that I provide the digital

was able to gain initial possession of the records in 1940 because of a privileged status and
arrangements that are not commonly given to archival researchers. Even today, the PHMC and
its researchers remain unable to access the state’s complete collection of Harmony Society
records because of a decision in 1940 to loan archival records to Karl J.R. Arndt, the historian
and documentary editor. The PHMC recovered some of the loaned records from Arndt and in the
aftermath of Arndt’s death in 1991 from his widow. Some of the records remain alienated from
government custody.
The natural question to ask is why the Commonwealth allowed Arndt to retain the
records for as long as he did. A letter from Lawrence Thurman, then curator of Old Economy
Village, to John W. Oliver, University of Pittsburgh history professor and Pennsylvania
Historical and Museum Commissioner suggests that there was not universal knowledge of the
approved loan within the agency or certainty of Arndt’s role in the papers’ displacement. 459
Thurman highlights notable Harmonist items that were included in the WPA’s finding aid of the
collection but that, at the time of his letter in 1954, could no longer be located at Old Economy
Village. “I have the strongest feeling,” Thurman writes, “that they [the missing papers] were
here after the WPA left.” 460 He explains, however, that this “feeling” is indeed just that – a
hunch that Thurman has as a consequence of his familiarity with Old Economy Village’s records
and a verbal account he heard only indirectly. Thurman said that he understood that a foreman of
maintenance at Old Economy Village, deceased at the time of his writing, sent numerous “boxes
and bundles of records” to Arndt. He goes on to maintain, “Loan slips were not made, and to my
knowledge this sending of documents was a matter between Mr. Arndt” and the referenced

employee. 461 There was, indeed, non-specific and little documentation surrounding the loans.
Moreover, the collections management records held in Harrisburg challenge the notion the
materials found their way into Arndt’s custody as a sole consequence of loans and raise the
possibility that he took even more than what the Commonwealth sent to him.
In the 1960s, Daniel B. Reibel, Director of Old Economy from 1965 to 1981, compared
the WPA’s catalog of Harmonist records with citations in Arndt’s books and found that records
that were supposed to be in Old Economy Village archives were not. 462 Reibel wrote to Stevens,
now the Executive Director of the PHMC, and recounted his interactions with the scholar and his
concerns:
When asked about these Dr. Arndt states categorically that these
documents were here in 1939 and imagined that Duss had destroyed
them…Within two months of denying he knew where these letter
books were, he gave them to the State Archives with the statement to
me that he had to take them to keep Duss from burning them. Along
with them he gave some loose letters. He did not give all the letter
books mentioned in his citations…This raises the question in my mind
of just how much did Dr. Arndt take from the Archives and what he
intends to do with it. He has a large collection of material on the
Harmony Society which he has tentatively offered to several institutions.
I suspect a great deal of our liberated material is among this collection.
I wanted to ask him about this before allowing him into our archives
again. 463
The discovery and identification stages in this particular replevin case involved a number of
challenges. First, Old Economy Village and the PHMC were confronted with the reality that the
loan agreements were vague and that Arndt apparently took more than what the public officials
transferred to him. Second, the PHMC had to attempt to distinguish which records in Arndt’s

possession were government property and which were records that Arndt acquired through
honest means.
The inconsistency in the understanding of the loan agreement across the agency and over
time likely prolonged the period in which the records remained in the scholar's custody.
Although Reibel was successful in recovering some records from Arndt, the negotiations in this
replevin case primarily occurred later, following the scholar’s death in 1991. Upon learning of
the death of her husband, the Executive Director of the PHMC wrote to Blanca H. Arndt and
requested the transfer of the government-owned papers back to the state. Mrs. Arndt’s response
revealed that she felt she exercised some rights over the records and, namely, held “the power to
alienate the thing” to a chosen party. She replied that she intended to transfer the Harmony
records, including now on loan for half a century, to another professor of German, Dr. Gerhard
Freisen, and stated, “I am fully aware of the fact that Dr. Arndt’s papers contain materials which
were graciously loaned to him by the Commission. I also realize that these papers should be
returned the Commission. However, Dr. Friesen will require these papers in order to complete
Dr. Arndts’ [sic] work.” 464 The PHMC, however, was unwilling to extend the length of the loan
any further but still demonstrated a readiness to compromise during the negotiation phase of this
replevin case. Brent D. Glass, PHMC Executive Director, said that although Mrs. Arndt could
not transfer the records to the professor, they would, after receiving the records that were on loan
to Arndt, “identify those items necessary for Dr. Freisen’s continued research and determine the
most appropriate way to reproduce those items for Dr. Freisen at no charge.” 465

Staff of the PHMC, and specifically the administrators at Old Economy Village, did not
recover all of the loaned materials directly from Arndt’s widow. There are papers that have an
even messier custodial history, finding their way into academic archives and the possession of
other private parties through transfers by the Arndts. A receipt signed by Shepherd in 1991
reveals 67 documents from the materials on loan to Arndt first entered the University of
Southern Indiana’s archival collections before returning to Ambridge. It reads, “These materials
had been in the temporary custody of USI. I [Shepherd] agree to place them immediately in their
original repository with the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.” 466 The
Commonwealth was forced to not only negotiate with Mrs. Arndt, but also to engage in
discussion the University of Southern Indiana, which had collections from Arndt, and Clark
University in Massachusetts, which was considering acquiring collections from Arndt. In these
secondary replevin cases, however, the institutions cooperated fully with the Commonwealth.
The archivist at the latter institution said that university policy would require the library to return
any property to its rightful owner that Arndt did not possess title to should they enter the
university’s collection; Linda A Ries, remarking on her communications with the Clark archivist
said, “Apparently they have acquired in the past papers of other professors who ‘borrowed’
materials from other institutions, and are familiar with this type of situation.” 467
Today, there is no indication in the finding aid that suggests that there are items in the
Karl J. R. Arndt collection that were in the Commonwealth's custody and placed on loan to the
scholar. When materials were recovered from Arndt, they re-entered the PHMC’s collection as

1794-1949 rather than rejoining PHMC Manuscript Group 185, the Harmony Society Papers,
1742-1951. 468 This latter collection contains the materials that the PHMC (then the Pennsylvania
Historical Commission) acquired from the surviving Harmonists in 1937, an acquisition that
included those materials lent to and retained by Arndt. Arndt’s perception of the records
originally loaned to him as part of his personal collection of Harmony Society papers is partly
perpetuated by the PHMC’s processing decisions. The finding aid reads, “The majority of the
materials in this collection were obtained by Dr. Arndt through a series of interlibrary loans,
1941-1943, from the Old Economy Village historic site while the remainder was collected
independently by Dr. Arndt.” 469
This is a replevin case in which the creators of the records are private individuals and,
because of this provenance, they are private papers. With the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s
acquisition of the Harmony Society papers in 1937, however, the papers became government
property. As discussed above, this transfer did not eliminate John S. Duss’s sense of personal
ownership of the materials, nor did Arndt display recognition of Pennsylvania’s ownership in his
failure to return the loaned items during his lifetime. Instead, his actions are those of an
individual who sees himself as the rightful owner and custodian. Having succeeded in persuading
Stevens to loan the materials needed for his research, Arndt proceeded to treat the records from
the PHMC’s collection no differently than those he collected independently and through more
legitimate means. This case provides insight to the psychology of collecting. Arndt’s possessive
disposition toward the records that he retained in his custody was born from the time he spent
studying them and the connection that he felt with the material.

The Eastern State Penitentiary Convict Affidavit Book
In 1821, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania legislature approved the construction of a prison in
the city of Philadelphia. Eight years later, the famed Eastern State Penitentiary opened, with its
unique – and criticized – system of solitary confinement and hard labor. 470 The focus of this
replevin case is a “convict affidavit book” that spans the years of 1839-1850 and includes
“inmates’ names, numbers and offenses, when they were released[,] and signatures from the
inmates and the warden.” 471 The case of the alienated convict affidavit book is notable in that it
is the sole example, located during this research, in which the PHMC involved the state court in
its replevin efforts. Ultimately, the PHMC and E.G. Marshall & Associates, the private party in
possession of the book, reached an agreement on custody. The agreement is probed in this
section.
A brief that E.G. Marshall & Associates submitted to the court for summary judgment
captures the circumstances under which the book came into the Philadelphia-based antiquities
dealer’s possession. In 1999, the party purchased the convict affidavit book at an auction held by
the auction house Samuel T. Freeman & Co. for $800 and had no “notice of any claimed defect
in seller’s title.” 472 In September of 2008, E.G. Marshall & Associates decided to list the book on
eBay, with a starting bid price of $5,000. It was then that the PHMC learned of book and its
location. 473

An event that followed the e-Bay posting and preceded the PHMC’s seizure of the book
exemplifies the inconsistent understanding of public records and ownership issues associated
with them. Identifying the Eastern State Penitentiary as a potential bidder, E.G. Marshall &
Associates contacted the Executive Director of the site via email and sent a link to the eBay post.
The Executive Director responded with interest in the item and an expression of disappointment
that E.G. Marshall & Associates had not contacted Eastern State Penitentiary prior to the e-Bay
listing. She wrote, “We regularly purchase items that aid our interpretation of the historic site.
This record book belongs in our collection.” She does not suggest that the book is a public record
of the state or encourage E.G. Marshall & Associates to contact the PHMC to inquire. Instead,
the Eastern State Penitentiary placed a bid of more than $10,000. 474 It is unlikely that the Eastern
State Penitentiary would have attempted to purchase the book if the staff considered the prospect
of a state replevin action. Ignorance as to the possibility of the book’s public nature is surprising,
given that the site’s staff would certainly be aware that the prison was a state institution.
Another party, however, outbid the Eastern State Penitentiary: the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, using an eBay handle that effectively disguised the true identity. Upon the closure
of the bidding period, two men arrived at the E.G. Marshall & Associates’ place of business.
Revealing themselves as Pennsylvania State Police officers and the parties behind the winning
eBay bid. The officers requested to see the book and, upon Marshall’s consent, they informed
him that the book “was a historical record demanded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” 475
The officers seized the book and placed it in the custody of Pennsylvania State Police. 476

The decision by the PHMC to pursue the book, resulting in its seizure, is best deduced
through the court opinion that dismissed the motions for summary judgment and called for a full
hearing. “He indicated that the Commonwealth had never assented to any transfer, sale or
abandonment of the Book, and never gave it to any party, and therefore, could not be rightfully
possessed by a private party.” 477 The “mode of loss,” in which the book escaped Commonwealth
custody was, the PHMC argued, simple to surmise. “Because there was no evidence that the
Book was stolen – not entrusted to another – or that it was in the Commonwealth’s possession
after 1937 when the provision relating to the retention of records was added, Marshall contends
that it is a good faith buyer in the ordinary courts of its business, and its title is superior to that of
the Commonwealth.” 478
As the court acknowledged, this was a case in which there was no question that the
convict affidavit book was a public record at the time of its creation. 479 The Eastern State
Penitentiary was a state prison and the records of the prison were state records. For the
Commonwealth Court, however, there were two sticking points. First, the date of creation
predated the origin of public records laws in Pennsylvania. Second, this is a case in which the
private party’s “mode of acquisition” is known, but the PHMC’s “mode of loss” is based on
limited evidence. The latter had implications for the PHMC’s ability to convince the
Commonwealth Court to grant the agency summary relief. 480

proposing to the court that the matter is clear and uncontested under the law and that a judgment should be filed in
advance of a full hearing. In the case of Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission v. E.G. Marshall &
477

170

The judge’s memorandum opinion indicates that the PHMC first learned that the
defendant was in possession of the book through a listing on eBay. The PHMC argued that the
aforementioned section 524 of Pennsylvania’s Administrative Code, enacted in 1937, gives the
agency the authority to determine the disposal of public records and identifies two potential fates
for these materials: preservation as archival records or destruction. In the PHMC’s interpretation
of the law, private ownership of public records is not possible. 481
This case was complicated by the fact that the convict affidavit book is nearly a century
older than Pennsylvania’s codified retention and disposal procedure for public records. For this
reason, the defendant argued that the Administrative Code is irrelevant. Unless the PHMC could
demonstrate that the book was removed from the Commonwealth’s custody or stolen from the
Pennsylvania State Archives, the defendant argued that the court should recognize E.G. Marshall
& Associates as a good faith buyer and rightful owner. Both parties sought summary relief from
the judge, which would allow for a decision without a trial. The judge determined that he was
unable to offer the summary relief either party requested and said it would be heard in a formal
hearing. 482 Instead, the parties chose to reach an out of state settlement in December of 2009.
In the settlement, both parties asserted ownership of the book but agreed to file for the
litigation to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning that neither would be able to bring the same
matter before court in the future. The core of the agreement involved compensation. The PHMC
consented to pay E.G. Marshall & Associates five thousand dollars as “settlement funds.” The
language in the settlement agreement refrains from characterizing this monetary transfer as
Associates, the PHMC petitioned the court to issue a summary judgment in favor of the Commonwealth’s claim of
ownership. E. G. Marshall & Associates also filed a motion for summary relief from the court, which would support
the private party’s ownership of the book and dismiss the PHMC’s claims to it.

V.D. SUMMARY
One state’s victory is not another state’s victory. Prior to the North Carolina Supreme Court
decision in State North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr., autograph dealer Charles Hamilton predicted
the demise of private collections should North Carolina successfully recover the bills of
indictment bearing Hooper’s signature. 484 This, of course, did not happen. Still, the influence of
the State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. case was strong in the years following the North
Carolina Supreme Court’s decision. There were instances in which state officials were able to
recover records in the absence of case law and statute, even without a complete sense of the
mode of loss. Dealers and collectors were aware of the ruling during the period when Baumann
was employed by the state. Just as David Gracy mused about the impact of the opinion on the
Texas State Archives’ recovery of a letter, it is not certain that North Carolina’s victory was the
primary reason that the PHMC was able to recover The Baynton, Morgan, and Wharton Papers,
the PHMC Minutes, and the book of excise in the years following. 485 It is certainly doubtful,
however, that it harmed the state’s claim.

Given the replevin successes in Pennsylvania in the years after North Carolina’s success,
it would seem that the Commonwealth would benefit from case law of its own to draw upon.
Case law, however, could hinder state replevin efforts if the court does not find in favor of the
Commonwealth; such a ruling would influence future court decisions related to replevin and
public records. Haury and his fellow officials were wise to settle the Eastern State Penitentiary
case in the aftermath of the judge’s dismissal of summary judgment. Based on the judge’s
Memorandum Opinion, victory for the Commonwealth was not a certainty.
There is a sharp difference in the case study of replevin in North Carolina and the case
study presented in this chapter. The issue of monetary compensation, decidedly blocked from the
replevin negotiations in North Carolina, is present in Pennsylvania and, in fact, appears to have
become a more prevalent aspect of the replevin process in recent years. In the 1980 case
involving the PHMC board minutes, Baumann was mindful of the language he used in reference
to the $50 compensation; it was a finder’s fee. Three years later, in negotiating with Yarosz and
his partner about another set of records, Baumann reasserted that the state was unwilling to
purchase papers of a public agency. The language associated with such a payment was and
remain deliberate. Even when the Commonwealth paid E.G. Marshall & Associates the
considerable sum of five thousand dollars for the Eastern State Penitentiary convict book, it was
called a “settlement fund” and not a payment.
Figure 4, which represents the replevin process, includes an arrow that points backwards
from the negotiation to selection stages. The Commonwealth today has encountered cases in
which it was necessary to reevaluate the decision to pursue a record because of resistance met in
the negotiation stage. This was not observed in the North Carolina case, where the state

173

consistently succeeded in recovering the records that state employees identified as important to
the collection.
There are two factors that aid North Carolina in is recovery efforts that would benefit
Pennsylvania. The PHMC needs a cheerleader in the Office of Attorney General, one who is
willing to, with the State Archivist, serve as a principal player in communicating and negotiating
with private parties in possession of alienated records. In communications with private record
holders, the North Carolina officials often succeeded by simply citing the statutory definition of
“public record” and applying it to the records in question. Although they do not often implement
the remedies provided for in sections 132.5 or 132-5.1, these sections add teeth to the ownership
claims. Haury certainly recognizes the value that a replevin statute would lend to the
Commonwealth’s recovery efforts. He expressed this in 2012, asserting, “The Commonwealth
should pass a replevin or recovery of government records law which allows both state and local
governments to recover their records which have been stolen or otherwise alienated from
government custody.” 486 For this, he needs more cheerleaders, individuals in both chambers of
the Commonwealth’s legislature who are willing to advocate for the PHMC.

VI. THE VIRGINIA CASE

“Indeed, we know how difficult it is
to obtain the return of archival materials in private hands.” 487
The Library of Virginia is the third case in this study, selected largely because of the level of
access to archival records that provide insight into the replevin tradition and processes in the
Commonwealth of Virginia. This chapter is largely a historical look at replevin, a consequence
of a dip in replevin activities that followed a Virginia court opinion in the early 1990s.
Like North Carolina and in contrast to Pennsylvania, Virginia is working within a legal
environment that should be beneficial to replevin efforts. George Bain, in his 1983 analysis of
state public records laws, categorized Virginia’s replevin law as “explicit, thorough, and
forthright in nature.” 488 Unlike replevin in North Carolina however, efforts to recover records in
the Commonwealth of Virginia are, today, infrequent. While the Pennsylvania State Archives
may indeed benefit from having a replevin statute to bolster claims, what emerges from this
study is an observation that statute and case law are not an antidote to the complexities that
characterize the question of ownership.

VI.A. THE MEANING OF PUBLIC RECORD IN VIRGINIA
Like the chapters before, the law is the starting point for examining the meaning of public record
in Virginia. The Public Records Act (Title 42.1, Chapter 7 of the Code of Virginia) establishes
the Library of Virginia’s authority as it relates public records management and attempts to define
both what a public record is and what it is not. This latter aspect of the statute has not eliminated
the variances in interpreting the public and private divide, but is addressed here, along with the
court opinions that have played a further role in fixing the meaning of “public record.”
Virginia’s public records statute differs from those that guide the actions of the other two
states in that it defines both “private record” and “public record.” Both definitions are included
here for comparison:
‘Private record’ means a record that does not relate to or affect the carrying out of
the constitutional, statutory, or other official ceremonial duties of a public official,
including the correspondence, diaries, journals, or notes that are not prepared for,
utilized for, circulated, or communicated in the course of transacting public
business…
‘Public record’ or ‘record’ means recorded information that documents a
transaction or activity by or with any public officer, agency or employee of an
agency. Regardless of physical form or characteristic, the recorded information is
a public record if it is produced, collected, received or retained in pursuance of
law or in connection with the transaction of public business. The medium upon
which such information is recorded has no bearing on the determination of
whether the recording is a public record.
For purposes of this chapter, ‘public record’ shall not include nonrecord materials,
meaning materials made or acquired and preserved solely for reference use or
exhibition purposes, extra copies of documents preserved only for convenience or
reference, and stocks of publications. 489
The definition of “private record” codifies what may seem self-evident: a person who holds a
public office is able to produce documentation that is of a personal nature. Just as a federal court

489

Code of Virginia § 42.1-77.

176

determined that William Clark’s journals, kept during his famed expedition, were his personal
records, contemporary government employees in the Commonwealth of Virginia have ownership
over documentation that falls outside of the responsibilities designated by law, policy, and
official position guidelines. Captured in this definition is the criterion used in determining
whether a public official’s records are public or private: the context under which it was created.
“Public record,” as defined by this chapter of the code, includes elements common to
statutory definitions of the term. 490 A public record documents an official action by a public
employee or by a Commonwealth agency and can be recorded on any medium. Neither of these
aspects of the definition is unique to the Commonwealth of Virginia’s use of the term. In a
pamphlet published by the Library of Virginia, the agency crafts a series of questions to use in
identifying whether a record is public or private:
• “Did the agency require creation or submission and maintenance of the
document?
• Was the document used to conduct or facilitate agency business?
• If the document is a draft or preliminary document created for background or a
similar purpose, does it contain unique information that explains formulation of
significant program policies and decisions?
• Was the document distributed to other offices or agencies for formal approval
or clearance?
• Is the document part of an electronic information system used to conduct
government business?” 491
If any of these questions are answered in the affirmative, the Library of Virginia advises the

The Code of Virginia includes additional chapters in which “public record” is defined. The Virginia Freedom of
Information Act (Title 2.2, chapter 37 of the Code) provides a definition of public record that differs from the Public
Records Act definition in language, but not content. The Commonwealth of Virginia avoids using “public record” as
a synonym for “open record,” as is the case in Pennsylvania’s Right to Know Law.

Notably, the Virginia Public Records Act characterizes a “nonrecord” as constituting
duplicates and publications printed by the agency. The above definitions apply to the
Commonwealth of Virginia’s replevin statute, found in sections 42.1-89 and 42.1-90. Exempt
from these sections would be two categories of documentation: private records and
“nonrecords.”7
The statutory definition in section 42.1-77 of the Virginia Public Records Act, however,
was enacted in 1976 and this date of codification has implications for the Library of Virginia and
county repositories in their recovery efforts. In the 1992 opinion in the case of Middlesex County
et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store, Judge William J. Person, Jr. cited case law
affirming that a statute does not apply retroactively if doing so “would impair vested rights,”
unless the Virginia legislature includes an express provision in the statute. 492 The Virginia
Public Records Act definition, Person asserted, is “broader” than the common law definition,
which he determined was created by 19th century case law – specifically, the 1874 case of
Coleman v. Commonwealth. Because the 1976 statutory definition is more encompassing than
the common law definition, the court found that it could not apply the former to the question of
ownership of seventeenth and eighteenth century records, presented in the case of Middlesex
County et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store. 493
While section 42.1-77 of the Virginia Public Records Act defines public records as records
“produced, collected, received or retained” in carrying out the official activities of a government
office, Coleman v. Commonwealth focuses on the act of keeping as the litmus test in identifying
whether a record is public in nature. Person interpreted the common law as follows:
[A public record] is ‘a written memorial made by a public officer authorized by

law to perform that function and intended to serve as evidence of something
written, said or done.’ He must have authority to make it; but that authority need
not be derived from express statutory enactment. Whenever a written record of
the transactions of a public officer in his office is a convenient and appropriate
mode of discharging the duties of his office, it is not only his right but his duty to
keep that memorial, whether expressly required so to do or not; and when kept, it
becomes a public document - a public record belonging to the office and not the
officer; is the property of the state and not of the citizen and is in no sense a
private memorandum. 494
Under the principle of stare decisis, Judge Person’s opinion has implications for the definition of
public records used in future cases heard before the Virginia courts. The concepts of “binding
authority” and “persuasive authority” are relevant here. A decision in a circuit court, the 9th
circuit of Virginia in this case, binds those courts within the same circuit and lower district
courts; Person’s decision regarding the definition of public record must guide these courts if a
similar dispute reaches them. 495 For those courts above the circuit courts – the Virginia Court of
Appeals and the Virginia Supreme Court – the circuit court opinion will have persuasive, but not
binding, authority. 496 As a result, if a replevin dispute reaches a Virginia court, the act of creation
or receipt by a public official may not be sufficient enough to demonstrate that a record is public
in nature. If a Virginia court abides by the principle of stare decisis, records that predate the
1976 VRPA definition of “public record” should be evaluated against the common law
definition, which focuses on the act of retaining a record as the determinant of its public status.
Over time, there have been changes to the requirements that guide what county clerks must

Virginia circuit courts hear both criminal and civil cases. With civil proceedings, “the circuit court has concurrent
jurisdiction with the general district court over claims from $4,500 to $25,000 and exclusive original jurisdiction
over almost all claims exceeding $25,000.” General district courts are lower trial courts for civil and criminal cases.

retain. Public officials must consider the requirements that existed at the time of the record
creation.
The context and the laws under which the records were created are key to identifying
whether a record meets the parameters under the common law definition. In deposing State
Archivist Manarin, Hamilton’s attorney focused on the law at the time of record creation and
consciously steered the testimony away from the law at the time of the replevin dispute:
Reiss: Did the law specifically require the clerk to retain plots or surveys.
Manarin: No, they were retained, and they are required by law to be retained now.
Reiss: No sir. I’m not talking about now…
Reiss: Other than original copies of wills, Doctor, do you know of any other
document that the clerks were required by law to retain?
Manarin: Not in Middlesex, no, sir. 497
The attorney for the defendant placed the onus on the local government to demonstrate that the
records are public and not his client’s responsibility to demonstrate that the records are private.
Judge Person asserted this in his Middlesex opinion, stating that “In order to prevail under the
Virginia Public Records Act, petitioners must prove, by a preponderance of evidence that each
individual document is a public record.” He expected the petitioner, Middlesex County, to situate
the records within the elements of the test. 498 Conversations with a party at the Library of
Virginia affirmed that the burden falls to the government to demonstrate ownership if a case
reaches court, rather than the burden resting on the defense. 499
Person applied the common law definition to the 81 records that Middlesex County
claimed as the property of the public. For example, when determining the rightful owner of a bill
that the county claimed, Person found that it “is a memorandum of a transaction between private

parties” and that the petitioners failed to demonstrate “by a preponderance of the evidence, that
the document was kept in and wrongfully removed from the clerk's office.” 500 The clerk’s
docketing on the bill was evidence only that it had passed through his hands. It was not, in the
eyes of the court, sufficient evidence to illustrate the clerk was required to retain bills. This item
was among those returned to Hamilton. Person’s application of the definition to the records
resulted in some of the materials returning to the petitioner, Middlesex County. The judge
returned three accounts to the county, which he defined as records that were “created by
individuals empowered by and sworn to the court to administer estates.” 501 He cited the statute
contemporary to the creation of the accounts that required them to be filed with the court. 502
In short, the judge, who had to carefully review the records individually in their relevant
statutory and definitional context, is evidencing that the identification of public records can be
complex, a process in which an individual may have to assume the role of a legal historian.
Person, by issuing his opinion, does provide a guide that both public officials and private
collectors can draw upon in claiming or defending ownership. If another county clerk in Virginia
learns that a dealer is selling accounts similar to those Middlesex County recovered, he or she
can use the judge’s decision to support a request for return. A private party can use the judge’s
opinion regarding the ownership of the bill to counter a public official’s claim to a similar
record.
The advantage of having this case law, for both the Library of Virginia and private
collectors, is that it ameliorates some of the ambiguity that surrounds the public versus private

nature of certain record types. “Some,” however, is the operative word here. Even if a public
official is able to claim that a record meets the conditions of Person’s test, the party in possession
of the record can argue that a public official willingly discarded or transferred ownership of the
record.

VI.B. THE REPLEVIN PROCESS IN VIRGINIA
The issue of alienated records has concerned library leadership in Virginia for more than a
century. In 1905, John P. Kennedy, a former State Librarian, made his first report to the Library
Board concerning the newly formed Division of Archives and History. Kennedy identified two
groups of private parties who were then in possession of state records. The first, he said were the
descendents of the “prominent men” of Virginia’s formative years who “in many instances value
[the records] highly and have preserved them with the greatest care.” 503 Kennedy praised the
voluntary contribution of these individuals to the formation of Virginia State Library’s “present
rich collection of manuscripts.” 504 He spoke less warmly of the members of the second group,
lamenting that “papers (imperishable monuments to a great man, if properly cared for) have been
sold to Northern collectors for small sums and scattered to the four winds, destroying forever
their value as a historical unity, and precluding permanently their use to the student.” 505 Whereas
Kennedy implied that the Library had cultivated relationships with the preceding group
members, knew what records were in these private collections, and trusted the records were well

preserved, he did not say the same for the latter. In his mind, the records that entered the
anonymous private collections were lost to the state for good.
There is no explicit use of the term “replevin” in Virginia statute and it is not expressly
used in the court documents from the Middlesex County case. Seldom does the word actually
appear in the records that form the Office of the State Archivist’s “Replevin Files, 1914-1992”
series. When it does occur, it is primarily observers from outside the Library of Virginia who are
using it. 506 The Library of Virginia’s processing of the Office of State Archivist’s papers is
revealing of the institution’s interpretation of the term “replevin.” The files that are included in
the “Replevin” series tell stories of the attempted or successful recovery of public records, stories
that follow the legal process outlined in sections 42.1-89 and 42.1-90 and stories that do not
involve the circuit court system.. The creators of the records within the series vary in the
language they use to describe recovery cases; in addition to recovery of public records, phrases
like “retrieval of public records,” “laying claim to public records,” “securing public records,” and
“attachment” emerge from the records. 507 There is some reference, albeit limited, to recovery on
the Library of Virginia’s website. Figure 5 highlights examples of records that “recently
appeared for public auction, but have returned to the appropriate government agency.” 508

For example, a bookseller wrote to Manarin about the Middlesex County case and said, “If you are aware of any
other state archivists who have been involved in replevin cases in recent years, I would like to make contact with
them as well.” To the outside collector, the case had the characteristics of a replevin action. Jennifer S. Larson,
Yerba Buena Books, to Louis H. Manarin, October 22, 1991;Box 1, Replevin Files, 1914-1992.
507
Black’s Law Dictionary defines “attachment” as “the act or process of taking, apprehending, or seizing persons
or property, by virtue of a writ, summons, or other judicial order, and bringing the same into the custody of the court
for the purpose of securing satisfaction of the judgment ultimately to be entered in the action” Black’s Law
Dictionary 126 (6th ed. 1990). As a legal concept, it differs from replevin in two primary ways. Replevin technically
involves a claimant paying a bond and holding the property until the court determines ownership. When property is
attached, it is not necessary for the claimant to pay a bond and the court holds the property until a decision about
ownership is made. Brian A. Blum, Bankruptcy and Debtor/Creditor: Examples and Explanations, 4th ed. (New
York: Aspen Publishers, 2006): 48-50.

Figure 5: Screenshot of Library of Virginia’s “Examples of Virginia Public Records,” a set
of four images of three documents that have been recovered. The identifying information
seen here is the extent of what visitors to this page can learn about the records.
When classifying cases as “replevin,” the Library of Virginia does not draw a line
between recovery of public records stolen from a repository and public records that escaped the
custody of a government office through another means. This is in contrast to the State Archivist
of Pennsylvania’s exclusion of the recovery of stolen public records from his use of the term.
When asked in a deposition whether he had “any experience with the retrieval of records” that
were created by the colonial government, he cited the case of Larry Ivan Vass, a man who
removed records from the Library of Virginia and county courthouses, and the recovery of
records he stole. 509 The catalog entries for records that Vass stole and that the Library of Virginia
recovered are marked with references to “replevin.”
Replevin of public records is, as a practice, constitutional in the Commonwealth of
Virginia. In the early 1990s, the Virginia court system was asked to weigh the constitutionality

184

of sections 42.1-89 and 42.1-90 of the Virginia Public Records Act, the sections that empower
the Commonwealth to seize public records in private hands. In Middlesex County et al. vs. Jack
Hamilton d/b/a Hamilton’s Book Store, Rick Reiss, attorney for the Williamsburg-based dealer,
argued that the Virginia Public Records Act is unconstitutional in that it “authorizes a taking but
makes no provision for just compensation.” 510 He continued, “Clearly there’s been a taking [in
this case]. When a sheriff comes into your place of business with an order and walks out with 81
documents that are yours, there’s certainly been a taking. The Supreme Court has defined the
taking as when the government substantially disturbs the owner’s use and possession of his
property.” 511 Judge William L. Person, Jr., however, did not subscribe to Reiss’s argument. He
found that the Virginia Public Records Act does not violate the United States Constitution or
Virginia Constitution, both of which require that the government compensate a private party
when his or her private property is seized for public use. Person determined that “The Virginia
Public Records Act does not provide for the taking of private property[;] it simply demands that
materials are returned to the Commonwealth and proper custodians upon a determination that
they are public records.” 512 A public official’s authority to seize a record under section 42.1-90 is
not in violation of personal property rights.
To the Library of Virginia and custodians of public records in Virginia, “replevin” refers
to a constitutional practice. It is a term that encompasses any effort by a public official to recover
public records that are outside public custody. This section generalizes the shape of the replevin
process in the Commonwealth. Unlike the preceding chapters, replevin activities in Virginia have

largely focused on county records, but as anticipated, there are few, to use the words of the
Director of Description Services “real cases” involving recovery. A “real case” would involve
the Office of the Attorney General or a county attorney and would take the form outlined in
section 42.1-89 and, if seen as necessary, section 42.1-90. There has not been a court case in
Virginia focused on the recovery of public records since Middlesex County et al. v. Jack
Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store in 1992.
The more informal cases, those that do not involve the court, are today relatively rare as
well. Lyndon H. Hart, III, Director of Description Services at the Library of Virginia, estimated
that there are two or three recovery cases in Virginia annually. 513 A survey of fifty current circuit
court clerks supports Hart’s comments about the rarity of these cases. 514 Of the eighteen who
responded, only one clerk described an experience in which she recovered a public record that
was in private custody. 515
This section and the case studies that follow are largely built from an analysis of archival
records and discussions with Lyndon H. Hart, III, Director of Description Services at the Library
of Virginia. A caveat is necessary here. While there is the statute that outlines how a public
official can petition the court for ownership of a record, there is no internal, written procedure to
guide how public officials should move forward with recovery that does not involve an
application of section 42.1-89 and section 42.1-90 of the Virginia Public Records Act. Practices

marriage informed me that he had a Last Will and Testament located in his home or in a safety deposit box, both of
which were shared with the girlfriend. I wrote a letter to the girlfriend and requested that she bring the will into my
office by a certain date - she complied and the will was probated.” Nottoway Circuit Court Clerk, Email to author,

change and decisions vary when they are not bound by policy. It was evident, however, in
studying the archival records, that there are elements that have carried over from earlier cases to
modern day practice – namely, the “care and keeping” compensation that is often included as
part of the negotiation phase.
Discovery: Like the states in the preceding chapters, discovery today occurs when a
public official sees a record that he or she believes to be public property for sale in an auction
house catalog or on eBay. Whether the individual who makes the discovery is an employee of
the Library of Virginia or is a county clerk can influence the steps that follow. At the Library of
Virginia, it is generally the collections development archivist who spends time with auction
catalogs and eBay. If he discovers what he believes is a state record, he will alert the Director of
Description Services, who will work to identify whether the questionable record is public
property. If the record appears to be a local record, the collections development archivist will
notify the Head of Local Records at the Library of Virginia. The individual in this position either
passes the discovery onto a relevant local official, such as the clerk in the county where the
record was either created or received, or does research to identify whether the record is public
property. 516
If it is a clerk who discovers a circuit court record, he or she can, under the Virginia
Public Records Act, file a motion with the court system for its recovery or attempt to recover the
record without a formal filing. They may choose, however, to seek guidance from the Library of
Virginia staff upon making the discovery. One circuit county clerk who has held office for eight
years said that she has not been involved in any recovery cases, but offered insight into the
course of action she would take upon discovering an out-of-custody record. She would determine

of Local Records was vacant.
516

187

whether the record is a record that belongs in her custody and, if it is, she would reach out to the
Library of Virginia staff for guidance about moving forward with a claim. 517
There are cases in which the party in possession of the questionable records brings them
to the attention of the Commonwealth directly. A dealer, for example, may approach the Library
of Virginia to inquire about the provenance of a record because he or she may want to avoid
getting embroiled in a later dispute. Former State Archivist Manarin, for instance, made
reference to dealers who contacted him out of “apprehension” that they may be holding public
records. 518 Alternately, a dealer may not be aware of laws that may pertain to records in his or
her custody and view the Library of Virginia or locality as a potential buyer. The case of the
Journal of the Virginia Convention, probed in detail below, is an example of the latter.
Identification: The discovery of a suspicious record and the confident identification of it
as public property do not occur concurrently. Hart explained that if the Library of Virginia
discovers a record that appears to belong in the archives, the staff contacts the seller and request
a photocopy of the reverse side of the document. He remarked, “Oftentimes in the catalog [or on
the eBay posting], they’ll only show the front side. The docketing information is generally on the
back. That’s where we might see something that identifies [it as a public record].” 519 A
photocopy, then, can be used as an aid for identifying a record as either public or private.
Docketing, generally located on the back of paper, can serve as a clue that supports a claim for
public ownership, though the judge’s decision in Middlesex County et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a
Hamilton's Book Store suggests that a court may require additional evidence that the record
meets the definition of public record. 520

The depositions entered into evidence in the Middlesex County et al. v. Jack Hamilton,
d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store provide historical insight into how public officials approached
determining whether records are public and the resources that can assist them in doing so. Louis
H. Manarin addressed modes of discovery and the initial steps toward identification. He stated,
“If I am informed of the sighting of a record that may be public in a catalog for sale or if I, in
examining a catalog of documents for sale, discover what I feel is to be a public record, then we
will initiate correspondence to the dealer to inquire and to seek copies of the documents to verify
if they are public records.” 521 The photocopy is again touted as a tool for identification, though it
is the only a preliminary tool and not a substitute for an examination of the original. The attorney
for the defense questioned Manarin about the steps taken if, upon viewing copies, his suspicions
as to the public nature of the records is confirmed. Manarin said he or the appropriate public
official would ask the private party to facilitate an examination by the Library of Virginia or the
locality, either by bringing the records to the public office or transferring them for a period. 522
Seizure was, during Manarin’s tenure, the tack that was taken only if the private party refused to
cooperate with the Library of Virginia’s request to examine the records. 523 The importance of
viewing the original was raised in case heard in the Middlesex County circuit court. The county’s
attorney stressed the necessity to have the records transferred from the courthouse, where they
were held, to the Library of Virginia for a period of 60 days. 524 While Manarin saw the records
in Hamilton’s store, he did not have the opportunity to conduct a sufficient examination of the
originals and “definitively identify them as being public records.” 525

The Hart and Manarin depositions, along with an internal memo from Hart to Manarin,
provide insight into identification approaches and tools. Hart’s memo outlines an authentication
approach, a diplomatics strategy for first determining whether a local record in question is an
original. With local records, Hart’s approach involves a consideration whether the clerk’s name
on the record is contemporary to the purported date, whether there are original seals present, and
whether there are handwritten phrases such as “examined, order recorded, [and] recorded and
examined.” 526 He offered similar testimony in court. When Hamilton’s attorney questioned
whether there is a “step-by-step protocol” for determining whether records are public, Hart
referred to his method of physically examining the records for authenticity and context and
framed his response within identification of local records. Upon identifying a record as an
original, Hart’s focus is directed to evidence of recordation, or evidence that the clerk filed the
records. 527
In his deposition, Manarin responded to a similar question as follows: “In determining
whether they are public records, there are things that you examine the document for: recordation,
information, the nature of the document as to whether it’s a will, a deed, emancipation, an
inventory, and the styling of the document, and the laws as to whether it’s required by law to be
maintained, and also if it had, by any action of the Court, been maintained and retained by the
Court.” 528 Here, Manarin pointed to the record’s structure and content as tools for identifying
whether it is public or private in nature, but pointed to the importance of relevant statute as well.
The noting of statutes contemporary to the origin of the record was, in the Middlesex County
case, among the most pertinent tools in arguing the public nature of the contested records and

demonstrating that clerks were required by law to retain them. In addition to using the Code of
Virginia, Hart described referencing Hening’s Statutes at Large and Shepherd’s Continuation of
Hening’s Statutes, published collections of colonial and early American statute and case law. 529
Selection: The 1970s was a decade of activity in the area of replevin. State legislatures in
Virginia and North Carolina alike added replevin statutes to state records laws and the landmark
case of State of North Carolina v. B.C. West, Jr. sparked discussion about ownership and public
records in publications and on the conference circuit. In the case against Larry I. Vass, who was
found guilty of grand larceny of historical documents in 1972, Church offered testimony on the
Library of Virginia’s decisions to pursue Commonwealth records in private hands. During this
decade of replevin activity, it would seem that Church’s position was comparable to the one
espoused in North Carolina today: if the Commonwealth discovered a Virginian record for sale,
the Library of Virginia would pursue that record. He testified, “Any paper that comes up for sale
at an auction house in New York that is clearly the Commonwealth or the State[’s], we lay claim
to it and it is returned…Any dealers’ catalogs that we find that lists a document that is ipso facto
property of the Commonwealth we lay claim to.” 530 While it may have been the case then that
the Library of Virginia claimed only those records that the archives staff viewed as having longterm archival value, Church did not reference the nuances of selection in his testimony. The State
Archivist’s administrative records do not provide faithful evidence of the frequency of replevin
actions during Church’s tenure; it is not possible to know whether there are more stories from the
1970s than those recorded and preserved in the Library of Virginia.

Twenty years later, in another court testimony in the case against Jack Hamilton, Manarin
expanded the issue of selection, this time adding parameters to what records the Library of
Virginia pursued. The dealer’s attorney aimed to learn “what guidelines are established to tell the
Archives and Records Division which specific documents to seize.” 531 Manarin responded by
citing records retention and disposition schedules, explaining, “there are guidelines through these
retention and disposition schedules as to which records are permanent.” 532 While Manarin
stopped short of explicitly stating that his agency targeted only permanent records in private
hands, he implied as much by drawing a connection between the records schedules and the
“guidelines” for record claims. When asked about guidelines that help public officials determine
which records to pursue, Hart, in his deposition for the same case, stated, “If they’re public
records, we would want them…Either we want them or to see them in the courthouse.” 533 Like
Manarin, however, he went on to reference records schedules and their influence on selection.
He explained that, in Virginia, any public record created prior to 1904 is characterized as
archival and would therefore be a recovery “priority.” 534
Manarin’s same testimony in 1991 bound the criteria for selection even further. When
questioned by Hamilton’s attorney about whether Colonial Williamsburg and the Virginia
Historical Society possessed Commonwealth public records, Manarin responded in the
affirmative. 535 The attorney further pressed to learn whether the Library of Virginia had made
any attempt to secure the transfer of the records from the repositories. 536 “No,” said Manarin,
indicating that in these cases either he, the State Librarian, or the locality decided not to pursue

the records. 537 He continued, “Those records are in the possession of a repository and are
accessible to the public, and they’re being cared for.” 538 The decision to allow records in archival
collections to remain in those archival collections is reflective of the replevin priorities that
Peterson and Peterson outline in their Archives & Manuscripts: Law. In instances in which the
government archives learns of a private repository’s possession of a public record, Peterson and
Peterson suggest that the former should ensure that the record is available for research and, if it
is, may consider leaving it in the latter’s custody. 539 This continues to be the practice of the
Library of Virginia. 540
Hart’s discussion of the Library of Virginia’s approach for selecting which records to
pursue is reminiscent of Boles and Young’s black box model. Archivists, Boles and Young
argue, should consider the value-of-information, the costs-of-retention, and the implications-ofthe-appraisal-decision. In his discussion of the recovery priorities, Hart described the Library of
Virginia’s focus on the evidentiary value of alienated records through a hypothetical example. If
the public officials learn of a land grant that Thomas Jefferson signed and that is in private
custody, they likely would not pursue it. For Boles and Young, an assessment of the value-ofinformation involves considering whether there is repetition of the record content in other
materials. 541 The official record of a land grant is the copy that the clerk transcribed and
recorded; if the clerk’s copy is in public custody, a duplicate that bears Jefferson’s signature –
though it would have financial and intrinsic value -- would not be a priority for recovery. Hart

summarized this core aspect of the selection decisions with a question: “is this information
available elsewhere in the archives?” 542 Building a collection of signatures is not the mission of
the Library of Virginia.
Boles and Young conceptualize “costs-of-retention” as an evaluation of the costs of
storage and processing of the records; it involves “an estimate of the potential costs of the
repository of the appraisal recommendations.” 543 For replevin decisions, there is a different costbenefit consideration. Because, as described below, the replevin process in Virginia typically
involves a “care and keeping fee,” the available purse is a factor in the decision. Hart said, “If we
had unlimited funds then, we’d go after everything we thought was ours. But since we don’t, we
try to go after things that are the best use of our money.” 544
As addressed above, rarely do archives staff at the Library of Virginia and circuit court
clerks engage in replevin activities today. There are instances when staff at the Library of
Virginia learns that there is what they believe to be a public record for sale and choose to
purchase the record from the eBay seller or the dealer if the cost is low. The thinking behind this
practice is that the cost of the record outweighs the cost of the efforts to negotiate for the
recovery, particularly when the record is out of state and outside the reach of sections 42.1-89
and 42.1-90 of the Virginia Public Records Act. 545 Such a purchase is distinct from what this
dissertation understands as a replevin action and is an alternate path to the course of recovery
outlined here. It is similarly distinct from the practice of offering a “care and keeping”
compensation to the private party, discussed below as a negotiation tactic.

Negotiation: It was and remains the preferred practice to settle ownership disputes
without the involvement of the Virginia courts. In a 1949 letter to then State Librarian Church,
Virginia’s Attorney General J. Lindsay Almond Jr. conveyed the position of his agency, which
merits quoting here:
Upon learning of the location of public records of archival character which have
been removed form the custody of the legal custodians, I suggest that you
endeavor to initiate negotiations on an amicable basis asserting title in the
Commonwealth with the request that such records be returned to the State
Librarian, or his duly accredited representative…In our conference you and I were
in complete agreement that we should avoid litigation in ever instance whenever
possible to reach amicable adjustment consistent with the best interests of the
Commonwealth. I feel certain that the Governor, and the Library Board, would
approve a course of procedure designed to avoid, if possible, any deterioration of
the relationship of comity[,] which exists to the mutual advantage of Virginia and
any State, institution or agency which may be in possession of records as to which
Virginia could assert lawful title. Instead of making a written demand, I am
inclined to the view that, where practice, it would be better to first seek to arrange
a personal interview with some one in authority to deal with the matter. 546
The record is part of an unprocessed collection and the circumstances that prompted this
particular letter can only be surmised; some months after Almond’s writing, Church
communicated with a Philadelphia-based dealership about records in its catalog that the Library
of Virginia believed to be state records. 547
While it is unclear what the impetus for the letter was, the passage is revealing in a
number of ways. First, both agency heads wanted to maintain external relationships with entities
in possession of private records. However, the men recognized that litigation, or even the threat
of litigation, could damage these external relationships – a notable assessment given that
Almond’s writing predated the Manuscript Society’s vocal protests to replevin cases like United
States of America v. First Trust Company of Saint Paul (1958) and State of North Carolina v.

B.C. West, Jr. (1976). The best approach to negotiating is a conciliatory approach. Like former
Pennsylvania employee Roland M. Baumann, the Virginia public officials viewed compromise
and soft language as the best course of action for recovery of public records.
Almond’s letter is evidence that there were public officials outside of the Library of
Virginia and the clerks’ offices who were attentive to replevin activities in the Commonwealth
and who were participants in crafting recovery approaches for cases that occurred outside of
court. Almond even sent Virginia’s Governor William M. Tuck a copy of his letter and Tuck
later wrote in response, “I concur in the comments of the Attorney General.” 548 In contrast,
today’s archival staff members at the Library of Virginia engage and involve the Office of the
Attorney General and, even, the State Librarian only when they want to take a private party to
court, which has not occurred since 1993. 549
Additionally, the Attorney General expressed a preference for verbal negotiations with
private parties and, today, unwritten interactions remain characteristic of recovery cases. 550 This
historical and continued practice has consequences for research on replevin in Virginia. There
are archival records that provide insight into the process, but there are gaps; isolated letters, like
a 1950 communiqué between State Librarian Church and a Duke University librarian, tell
incomplete replevin stories. 551 Moreover, it is difficult for a researcher to grasp, from a study of
the archival record, the frequency of replevin cases in Virginia.
The same letter from Almond to Church provides insight into the compensation aspect of
replevin negotiations occurring at that time. He wrote, “Whenever the person or agency from

whom custody is sought asserts, in good faith, a claim for compensation for recovery, and
preservation during the interim in which the records have been lost to the Commonwealth, the
matter should be referred to the Attorney General with your recommendation as to whether the
claim should be compromised. The Attorney General, with the approval of the Governor first
obtained, would have authority to effect a compromise.” 552 What Almond described here is not
payment for the record, but payment for a service – the care of the record. The distinction here is
important. By avoiding the suggestion that the Commonwealth is purchasing the record, the
Library of Virginia and the Office of the Attorney General do not muddy their position that the
record in question is Commonwealth – and not private -- property.
Compensation as part of the negotiation stage was a practice that predated Almond’s
letter and one that continues today. Just as the Pennsylvania State Archivist uses the phrase
“finders’ fee” to describe compensation to private parties in acknowledgement of the transfer of
a record to the Commonwealth, past and present public officials have used terminology that is
similarly measured. There is reference in the records to the Library’s payment of a “care and
custody” compensation to the private party as early as 1914. 553 “Care and keeping,” the
descriptor currently used, appears to have originated during Manarin’s tenure as State
Archivist. 554 Although the language has remained consistent, there has been a shift with regard
the players involved in compensation decisions. As Almond’s letter indicates, the matter of
compensation was, in 1949, under the purview of the Office of Attorney General and even
involved the Governor’s approval. Today, the Library of Virginia and the localities have greater

leverage to make monetary determinations as part of the negotiations; the Office of the Attorney
General is not required to approve this payment. 555
Finally, an issue that may arise in the negotiation stage concerns the sufficiency of a
copy. The current Director of Description Services suggests that, in some instances, the Library
of Virginia has agreed to accept a copy. The decision occurs when the alternative is to secure no
record at all. Hart explains, “We don’t like the original to stray, but the informational content is
what is really important. If we’ve got that, at least people can access the evidence it provides.” 556
This stands in contrast to the testimony of Thornton Mitchell, one of the most impassioned
crusaders of replevin activities, in the case against West. If the Library of Virginia had
photocopies of a document that is in private hands, Manarin said that the state would consider it
a “hindrance…insofar as it violates the archival integrity of the records.” 557
Custody Determination: Today, a custody determination is generally finalized when the
parties reach an agreement regarding the care and custody compensation and the transfer is
made. A replevin dispute is rarely brought to a conclusion with a donation, Hart said, but it has
occurred; he implies that a custody determination that concludes in such a way is distinct from a
transfer and care and custody compensation. Hart recalled one case in which a private party had
spent a considerable amount of money on records that the state later identified as alienated public
records He said, “I understand that person not wanting to give it up but it was too much money
for the document for us to pay and we worked out something where, for a tax write off, they

the descriptive notes and with a subject term of “Replevin -- Virginia.” 560 As described in the
cases below, not all recovered records are indicated accordingly in the catalog entries, but there
does appear to be a frequent practice of informing the user of replevin as part of custodial
history.

VI.C. CASE STUDIES OF REPLEVIN IN VIRGINIA
The cases in this section offer a historical look at replevin in Virginia, with a century separating
the first and the final examples. Like the states above, the availability of records that provided
insight into these narratives was a main impetus for their selection. Moreover, by examining
cases that both preceded and followed the court opinion in Middlesex County et al. v. Jack
Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store, the influence of the case on the replevin activities in the
state may be considered.
The Lossing Estate Papers
The earliest located replevin case in Virginia – and, in fact, in all three of the states studied -involves a custody dispute with the heirs of Benson J. Lossing, a prolific historian and engraver
who was born in 1813 and died in 1891. 561 The State Library of Virginia (now the Library of
Virginia) pursued records in the custody of the Lossing estate on two occasions, first in 1892 and
again in the months between 1912 and 1914. Because of the availability of documentation, the

latter replevin effort is the primary focus of this section, with the analysis based on a study of
archival records and contemporary newspaper reports about the dispute. The case suggests that a
recovery negotiated between the state archives and the private party has limited influence on
future cases, particularly when there is a change in administrations. Despite the State Librarian’s
hope that the successful recovery of the Lossing papers would provide a valuable precedent for
Virginian replevin efforts, the case appears to be lost to the archives. 562 There is little reference
to the Lossing case, outside of quick allusions in court transcripts, in the records that make up the
“Replevin Files” series at the Library of Virginia.
War dramatically altered the custodial history of the Lossing records. The wartime fate of
records held in Richmond connects to a larger narrative concerning the vulnerability and
displacement of historical and cultural materials during periods of unrest and transition. There is
no question that the Civil War had devastating effects on Virginia’s recorded history. Troops
pillaged government buildings for trophies of war, Union troops burned courthouses and their
records within, and as parts of Richmond burned in April 1865, so too did much of Richmond’s
documentation. 563 During this period of unrest, public officials later came to believe that some of
Virginia’s records left Richmond in Lossing’s hands.
In their coverage of the second replevin case, newspapers, including The New York Times
and the now defunct New York publication The Sun, aimed to address how Lossing became the
custodian of the disputed records. While there are similarities in the newspaper accounts, namely
with regard to the timing of Lossing’s acquisition, they are largely speculative. No records exist
that document a transfer of title to Lossing or that prove that the records had been in a state

office prior to their removal. A New York Times reporter placed Lossing in Richmond in 1862
for a research trip, explaining, “it was during the days of Reconstruction, the Virginia authorities
allege, that Dr. Lossing obtained possession from the Provisional Government of Virginia of the
valuable State documents whose ownership is now disputed.” 564 Both The New York Times and
The Sun indicated that Lossing carried letters from federal government officials to Virginia that
were intended to assist him in obtaining access to historical records. 565 Lossing, one reporter
posited, likely felt “justified” in taking the records and was confident that he could more
effectively ensure their safety during turbulent years marked by loss in Virginia. 566 Newspaper
accounts also suggested that the record keepers may not have recognized the value of the
materials in their care and willingly turned them over to Lossing. 567
There was at least one letter to the editor, however, that described a different mode of
acquisition, one that placed Lossing in a more questionable light. Although the letter is based on
hearsay, it is notable that there was enough attention and concern about the displaced records to
prompt even a single response from a member of the public. A reader of the Abingdon Virginian
recalled that Lossing – or perhaps, he said, it was a representative for Lossing – visited the
former clerk of his county in order to study local records. The letter writer maintained, “After
Lossing or his agent left, [the clerk] found these valuable records were missing and his idea was
that they had been taken by this man without leave from any one. This may throw light on how
the records from Richmond were gotten.” 568 The public officials involved in second of the two
recoveries, however, did not substantiate the account of theft. Instead, the position of the

Commonwealth was that the transitional government in place during the historian’s visit did not
have the authority to transfer to Lossing title to the records. 569
There are similarities in the two replevin cases involving records in the Lossing estate. In
both cases, the records were outside of Virginia, first in Massachusetts and then in New York,
and consigned to auction houses. Both predated the modern public records law and, namely,
sections 42.1-89 and 42.1-90 of the Code of Virginia, which codify the process for filing a
motion with the court system and requesting seizure of records. The Commonwealth was
successful in negotiating with the Lossing heirs and arriving at a custody determination in 1892
and again in 1912 through 1914. The State Library had the legal support of the Office of the
Attorney General as well as legal representation in Massachusetts and New York respectively in
the recovery cases.
The Journal of the House of Delegates of the State of Virginia for the 1897-1898 session,
along with archival records and newspaper articles created and published during the second
replevin case, provide information of the 1892 events. Upon Lossing’s death, his heirs
commissioned a Boston auction house to sell items, including a collection of records, from his
estate. How State Librarian Charles Poindexter learned of the records in Boston is unclear, as is
the precise nature of the 68 papers that he identified as potentially public property. The sole
description of the original lot comes from a dealer, who is quoted by The Evening Post as saying,
“ ‘There were included fifteen Washingtons, thirty-one Lafayettes, a number of Rochambeaus
and other Virginia state documents, many of them bearing signatures of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence, old Members of Congress, and generals.’ ” 570 This description,
however, is little help in understanding what made these records public in nature. Although the

autographs may have been the primary interest of this particular dealer, the presence of public
officials’ signatures alone does not render a record public property.
The circumstances surrounding the 1892 discovery and the identification of the Boston
records are hazy, but Poindexter evidently made a decision to act, calling upon Boston law
enforcement to seize the records from the auction house. While The Evening Post reported
twenty years later that “the Virginia authorities had no difficulty in establishing a legal title of
ownership,” conflicting evidence suggests that it was a complex dispute. 571 Because the records
were out of state, Poindexter hired Massachusetts attorney Moorefield Storey as legal
representation for Virginia. Storey filed suit on behalf of the State Library and engaged in
negotiations with the Lossing heirs in an effort to settle the matter of ownership. 572 Storey, in an
1897 letter to the Governor of Virginia, said that the Library of Virginia was unable to provide
proof of title to the records that was sufficiently persuasive to the Lossing heirs and their
attorneys. In the face of the difficult negotiations, The Library returned to the selection phase of
the replevin process, reevaluating their interests in the records. According to Storey, he made the
decision to push the replevin case forward, even without the support of the State Library. 573 He
wrote to the Governor, “The result [of the stalemate] was a direction to abandon the suit, on the
ground that the State did not wish to incur expense. This instruction I did not follow, because I
thought that the defendant was so weak that some compromise could be made, and the result of
much negotiation was the division of the documents. As for my services, since my instruction to
go no further, we have made no charge and propose to ask nothing save what was paid at the

outset, $100.” 574 This was a replevin case that was ultimately brokered without the involvement
of any public officials from Virginia. What it was not, as The Evening Post reported two decades
later, was a seamless and uncomplicated recovery.
Thanks to Storey’s singular efforts in 1892, records did return to Virginia; the
Massachusetts attorney mailed the items directly to the sitting Governor and not Poindexter. In
his letter to the Governor O'Ferrall, Storey indicated that his negotiations were settled with a
compromise.

575

Decades later, during his pursuit of the second group of Lossing estate records,

State Librarian McIlwaine recalled that Storey reached a custody determination that involved a
division of records. The 68 records were divided into two groups, with the State Library and the
Lossing heirs each receiving half. 576 Because of the limited evidence available about what
records were included in the 1892 auction, it is not possible to ascertain what the Virginia State
Library recovered. There is no evidence, however, that Library staff described or processed them
in a manner that would mark them as records that were once out of state custody.
State Librarian McIlwaine made his initial discovery of this second group of records
when reviewing the Anderson Auction Company catalog, a familiar mode of discovery in
replevin cases predating eBay, and subsequently contacted both the auction house and officials in
the state, including then Governor William Hodges Mann. 577 Following the discovery,
McIlwaine, accompanied by Assistant Attorney General Richard B. Davis, traveled to New York
City to meet with representatives of the auction house about 84 advertised records that the State
Librarian suspected were Virginia property. The meeting on May 7, 1912, it was reported, was

“of a wholly amicable and conciliatory nature” and resulted in the following statement from the
auction house:
We will suspend the sale of any manuscripts claimed by the State of Virginia in
order to permit the Commonwealth to make good its claim. We are merely acting
as agents in this sale, and it will not be necessary for the Virginia authorities to
attach the records which are claimed by them, although they may do so at their
pleasure. We will certainly not surrender any of the documents in our possession
until the title has been established. That is merely in justice to ourselves. If the
documents claimed by Mr. Davis and Dr. McIlwaine really belong to the
Commonwealth of Virginia, they will be surrendered upon proper proof of such a
claim.” 578
Anderson Auction Company did indeed act in accordance to this statement and, as no seizure
was made, the Commonwealth evidently agreed that this was an unnecessary action.
Compromise between the auction house and the state government characterized the arrangement
that followed the initial meeting. Because they planned to sell additional materials from the
Lossing estate in subsequent sales, the auction house mailed catalogs to McIlwaine and agreed to
pull records that the State Librarian flagged as potentially public in nature. This back and forth –
the mailed catalogs and the notification of suspect records – continued into the following spring
of 1913. 579
Between 1892 and 1912, McIlwaine believed that the Lossing heirs sold the records they
retained in the first replevin case as these particular materials were not included in the 1912 New
York lot. 580 Like the case before it, however, little evidence exists about the records themselves
that can contribute to an understanding of the meaning of public record in the early 20th century.
Neither do the archival records provide much insight into the identification approaches that

McIlwaine and his staff employed. A newspaper report is the primary source for information
about what records were among the original group of 84 claimed by the Commonwealth. The
reporter’s description, however, focuses on the autographs of historical figures that were present
in the papers and not the context in which the papers were created, the latter being the basis for
evaluating whether records are private or public. 581
At the heart of the Commonwealth’s claim was an assertion that no individual or body
had the authority to transfer records to Lossing at the time of his acquisition. Importantly, both
the historian’s acquisition of the materials and the State Library’s efforts to recover them
predated the state’s modern public records law. A local paper explained the crux of the debate as
follows: “Now, the status of documents, or any property, for that matter, belonging to a State is
very different from that of property held by a private individual. A State cannot sell or give away
its possessions without a special enabling act by the Legislature. Therefore, no matter how
honestly he may have come by them, no person possessing Virginia State papers, without a
special act from the Virginia Legislature transferring title over them to him, can establish the
requisite title.” 582 This is the same argument that North Carolina officials have cited in their
recovery claims: in the absence of authorization from the appropriate body – in Virginia, the
Legislature, in North Carolina, the General Assembly or North Carolina Historical Commission
– a private party cannot have good title to a public record.
The rationale behind the Commonwealth’s decision to pursue can only be inferred. This
was a state that only a few decades prior to McIlwaine’s discovery lost much of its recorded
memory to fire and theft. Ernst Posner describes a slow recovery in the aftermath, remarking,
“Between the Civil War and the turn of the century, very little was done to care for Virginia’s

records; for poverty, indifference, and a lingering defeatist attitude combined to retard both
archival development and historical endeavor.” 583 Lester J. Cappon points to the historical
scholarship by McIlwaine and staff at the State Library of Virginia at the turn of the 20th century
as representative of a growth in appreciation for Virginia’s records. 584 The Commonwealth’s
decision to pursue the records may be indicative of the deepening societal value of records
during this period. In addition, McIlwaine’s own scholarly work as a documentary editor of state
and local records may have acted as an impetus for his pursuit of the Lossing estate records. 585
The age of the records and historical importance of the record creators were likely factors that
pushed the Commonwealth officials forward in their recovery efforts; the first set of records that
the state laid claim to were largely colonial materials and included letters by George Washington
and Lafayette. 586
While not ultimately followed, the negotiation approach that the Commonwealth and
Lossing family attorney proposed is unique to any examined in this study. The parties expressed
an interest in submitting the dispute to an arbitration body in New York, rather than to a judge or
jury. The State Librarian suggested that this route would lead to a speedier resolution and be less
expensive than the alternative. 587 He wrote, “Instead of going before a jury, or before a Judge in
a chancery proceedings, [the case will] be submitted to arbitration, one arbitrator to be named by
the State of Virginia and one by the Lossing estate, and in the case of disagreement a third
person to be called in by them to finally settle the matter, of course reserving to each part a right

McIlwaine published the records of the House of Burgesses and Virginia’s colonial government in a series of
volumes, as well gubernatorial papers. See, for example, H.R. McIlwaine, ed., Official Letters of the Governors of

to appeal the decision of these arbitrators.” 588 It is unclear from the records why this arrangement
did not come to fruition, but it speaks to the variety – and, indeed, the inconsistency – in the
ways one institution may choose to approach negotiations.
Although McIlwaine expressed a desire to come to a speedy resolution, this case
continued into the spring of 1914, when the Commonwealth was able to secure the cooperation
of the Lossing heirs. As is common with replevin in Virginia, the negotiations included an
agreement concerning compensation for the “care and custody” of the documents. 589 In exchange
for withdrawing the records from sale and for conceding all rights to the records, the State
Library of Virginia awarded the Lossing heirs $750.00. 590 With the signed receipt, a custody
determination was reached. As was the case in 1892, these recovered records appear to have
been reintegrated in the collection with no distinction made of their status of being out of state
custody at one time.
Now a century old, the Lossing case reveals little about the contemporary replevin
process in the Commonwealth of Virginia. What it reveals, however, is that a state can arrive at
recovery through distinct negotiating tactics and agreements of very different shapes. Once there
is a change in leadership, institutional memory about replevin often becomes hazy. There is a
tendency for state leaders to develop their own approaches to recovery as a consequence. This
means that, even when law remains unchanged, attempts to resolve ownership disputes may look
different.
Court opinions have a decided influence on future litigation in the state. This dissertation
argues that court decisions are the anomaly, raising the question of just how much impact a

settlement between parties can have on later replevin cases. With the Lossing affair, McIlwaine
hoped and indeed anticipated that a positive outcome for the Library of Virginia would have
lasting effects. Before the parties reached the custody determination in this case, McIlwaine
wrote to the state’s legal counsel in New York and referenced an advertisement he saw for a sale
of a letter written by Patrick Henry to the Governor of Virginia in 1786. He said, “Beyond doubt,
the letter is one belonging to the archives of the State of Virginia. However, I do not see that
anything can be done about this now. If we can ever get the Lossing matter straightened out and
the decision is favorable to the State of Virginia – as I am almost confident it will be – the
precedent will go far toward inducing collectors to give up this class of material to the State
without a struggle. I believe that a great deal may thus be recovered.” 591 McIlwaine,
undoubtedly, would have been discouraged and likely surprised by the outcome in the case
against Hamilton brought to court decades later.
Journal of the Virginia Convention, May 1776
In the months between August of 1774 and July of 1776, Virginia delegates participated in a
series of five conventions, the final beginning on May 6, 1776 in Williamsburg. Among the
delegates’ actions in the fifth convention was to formally separate from the Great Britain on May
15, 1776. 592 This second case focuses on the 1942 recovery of the original journal that
chronicled the fifth Revolutionary-era convention. While only seven years later Virginia’s
Attorney General expressed a preference for resolving custody disputes verbally, this case is
notable in that it is among the best-documented replevin cases encountered in this dissertation

study. It is included here as a unique example of the successful recovery of a record that was
held outside of the state and one that involved a larger set of players that generally characterizes
replevin activities in Virginia today.
War likely shaped the custodial history of the convention journal. Accounts of how the
journal escaped custody in Richmond, however, differ. The Library of Virginia’s Virginia
Memory, an online resource where users can access digitized collections, offers the following
narrative: “In April 1865, shortly after the end of the Civil War, a Union soldier removed the
journal from the state archives in the Capitol in Richmond and took it home with him. His
descendants sold the manuscript journal in 1942 to a Philadelphia dealer in rare books and
manuscripts.” 593 While it is interesting that the Library of Virginia highlights the displacement
of the record, the documentation of the replevin efforts questions the definitiveness of this
version of events. James Lewis Hook was indeed a Philadelphia-based party who was in
possession of the journal but he doubtlessly acquired the journal prior to 1942. The Library staff
began discussing Hook’s custody of the journal in the early months of 1941 when they learned
that he consigned the journal to a New York auction house in order for it to be sold. While the
Head Archivist posited that a Union soldier could have taken the journal from Richmond, he also
raises the possibility that the record could have been lost decades earlier, during Benedict
Arnold’s raid of Richmond. 594 The consignor responded that he “surmised, also, that this
Manuscript was probably lost during Benedict Arnold’s raid on Richmond in 1780.” 595The mode
of loss, to use Honoré’s terminology, is less clear than the description on the Virginia Memory

site would suggest. Ambiguity concerning how a record escaped government custody can be the
source of contention in replevin disputes; private parties may argue that a public official
willingly discarded the record. There is, however, no indication that the uncertainty surrounding
the mode of loss negatively influenced Virginia’s case. It was not a focal point in the ownership
dispute.
Instead, conflicting priorities are at the heart of the dispute in this case. James Lewis
Hook, the party in possession of the journal had one interest: monetary profit. The State Library,
conversely, was focused on seeing the record properly preserved and had no intention to pay
anything beyond a nominal fee. 596 Before seriously engaging Hook in negotiations, Van
Schreeven explained to the College of William and Mary’s librarian that the Commonwealth’s
preference was to purchase out-of-custody records rather than file a lawsuit. Van Schreevan
remarked, “It has been our experience that the institution of legal proceedings for the return of
Virginia archival material always leads into complications, and if within our means, we always
try to purchase such material which is offered to us.” 597 Hook’s price tag of $25,000, however,
was certainly not within the Library’s means. 598
Two institutions – the State Library of Virginia (today the Library of Virginia) and
Colonial Williamsburg – learned of Hook’s custody of the journal through Hook himself. Unlike
the dealers that Manarin described as contacting him out of concern that they were in possession
of a public record of Virginia, Hook contacted the repositories in an effort to find an interested
buyer for the journal. 599 Virginia State Librarian Wilmer L. Hall and Colonial Williamsburg

President Kenneth Chorley compared their discovery of the journal and communication with
Hook. Hall said that Hook had contacted the Library about the journal early in 1941, but “refused
to let us see the book, being apprehensive that we would attach [seize] it while in our custody as
an original archive to which the State retained title.” 600 Hook informed Hall that he intended to
offer it to Colonial Williamsburg for what Hall considered a “preposterous” price of $25,000.
His New York dealer contacted the living history museum and told Chorley that the
Commonwealth knew of the journal, but could not afford its purchase. Hook’s dealer then
traveled to Virginia to show the record to the Colonial Williamsburg staff, where the librarian
conducted a cursory examination. In response, Colonial Williamsburg’s message to Hook and his
dealer was clear: the record was the property of the Commonwealth of Virginia. 601
Hook, however, continued to court the site as a potential buyer, which Colonial
Williamsburg used as a means of facilitating the Commonwealth’s examination of the journal.
After securing a loan from Hook, Hunter D. Farish, Director of the Department of Research at
Colonial Williamsburg, transported the journal to Richmond for study; this was arranged without
Hook’s knowledge. In the capital, the focus was on authenticating the record as an original. 602
Among the tools that the State Library of Virginia used in its identification efforts was an
existing record in its collection: the Journal of the Virginia Convention of December 1775.
Equipped with the knowledge that one clerk maintained the records for both conventions, the
State Library staff compared the handwriting from the journals and confirmed that it was the
same. 603

213

The Library of Virginia, along with the Virginia Governor’s Office and the Office of
Attorney General, took interest in the journal because of the significance of the event that it
chronicles. Archivist William J. Van Schreeven communicated the historic value of the journal
to State Librarian Hall, articulating why the Commonwealth should pursue the record. He wrote,
“The convention of May, 1776 was perhaps the most important of the revolutionary conventions.
During its meeting were adopted the Declaration of Rights, the first Constitution and Resolutions
which led to the Declaration of Independence. As an archive of the State it is extremely
valuable.” 604 Van Schreeven appraised the record as having permanent archival value; this
appraisal was an impetus for moving forward with the claim.
When staff at the Library of Virginia first learned of the journal and Hook’s efforts to sell
it to Colonial Williamsburg, Van Schreevan expressed a willingness to accept a photocopy if the
historic site did indeed make the purchase. 605 His interest was to have the journal properly
preserved and available to the public. When the Colonial Williamsburg staff said they had no
intention to buy the record because they recognized it to be state property, the Library of
Virginia set aside the notion of acquiring a surrogate. 606
There were other factors that influenced the Library of Virginia’s pursuit of the journal.
There was public pressure to recover the record and interest from the Governor’s Office and the
Office of the Attorney General. One private bibliophile, for example, wrote a series of
impassioned letters to Governor James H. Price, appealing to him for action. “We should not
have to purchase it, because it is State property,” said the ardent citizen. She continued, “I am a
Virginian…I have no words to express my resentment for this Yankee treachery to our State.” 607

This language is evocative of the positions of cultural nationalists in patrimony disputes over
objects of cultural heritage. 608 In actuality, the Library of Virginia was not alone in deciding to
recovery the journal; officials in the Office of the Attorney General became involved during in
the identification stage of the process and determined that the Commonwealth retained title to the
journal. So committed to recovering the journal for the state, the Attorney General Abram P.
Staples would not allow the State Librarian to return the journal to Farish, who had secured it on
loan from Hook. Staples wrote, “Since we are of the opinion that the book belongs to the State, I
doubt very much that it is within your power to return the same to Commonwealth Williamsburg,
Incorporated.” 609
Even with the involvement of the Attorney General, the negotiations remained outside of
court, but it appears that the participation of this agency effectively added pressure to the dealer
to comply. Prior to the Attorney General’s association with the case, there were reports that
Hook threatened to destroy the journal rather than allow the Library of Virginia to law claim to
it. 610 While the Library of Virginia had offered to compensate Hook with a nominal award, Hook
was unwilling to consider this proposal until a meeting with the Attorney General more than a
year later. The State Librarian’s case notes report the following: “Mr. James Lewis Hook called
on me April 28, 1942. He stated that he had been to see the Attorney General and had a
satisfactory conversation with him … He said he is now willing to accept the $500 for the
Journal and settle the matter amicably.” 611 From Hook’s perspective, circumstances had changed

See John Henry Merryman, “Two Ways of Thinking About Cultural Property,” The American Journal of
International Law 80, no. 4. (1986): 831-853. Perhaps the most famous cultural patrimony dispute focuses on the
Parthenon Marbles that are in the British Museum’s collection. The Greeks, who call for the repatriation of the
marbles to their native land, represent the “cultural nationalist” perspective.

little since the initial offer -- with the exception of Attorney General’s involvement. He was
unaware, for example, that Colonial Williamsburg had transported the journal to Richmond for
examination. State archives that have the strong support of their Attorney General’s office, like
the State Archives of North Carolina, may find that this is to the advantage of their replevin
efforts. Even if the legal counsel to the state makes no explicit threat of lawsuit initially, the
private party may recognize that litigation is a possibility and choose to make conciliations
during this negotiation stage.
Negotiations ended with the State Librarian’s agreement to pay the earlier offer of $500
to Hook; this was done with the Library Board’s approval. 612 A signed agreement solidified the
custody determination. Describing Hook as a “wily” individual, the Chairman of the Library
Board advised the State Librarian to obtain the dealer’s signature on a document that
acknowledged his receipt of $500 and the relinquishment of his claims to the journal. On July 9,
1942, with the receipt signed, the Library of Virginia concluded the replevin case. 613
The Journal of the Convention was accessioned into the record group titled “Convention of
1776.” The catalog entry (figure 7) reveals nothing of the custodial history of the journal that
climaxed with its recovery in 1942. This omission is in contrast to the entry for the Henrico
County records (figure 6), which even includes “Replevin – Virginia” as a subject term heading.
While a user is unable to access information about replevin and the convention journal through
the catalog entry, the Library of Virginia highlights the recovery story on its Virginia Memory
website.

The Virginia Memory webpage that describes the recovered journal suggests that “the
transaction was one of several made during the same period that established the precedents by
which the Commonwealth of Virginia has been able to recover a large number of lost public
documents.” 614 The question that emerges from a consideration of this case is whether the
Library of Virginia can and does draw upon a seventy-year old success to bolster a contemporary
claim of ownership. The Director of Description Services, who has been at the Library of
Virginia for 33 years, made no reference to instances in which the success in this case was used
in contemporary ownership claims. This dissertation found that public officials will draw upon
their own experiences in settling a case with a party when they encounter a similar circumstance.
It did not find, however, that a state’s successful recovery in one settled case will have much
influence in ensuring another success. Moreover, institutional memory, as the Lossing case
illustrates, is short and settlements sporadically documented.

There is little documentation that captures Hook’s perspective in the records in the
Library of Virginia’s collection. His position appears to be that he had the right to income of the
thing and the right to alienate it. His sales agent at the New York dealership said of Hook, “I’m
quite sure that the owner, although he would be perfectly willing to sell it, is not willing to give it
away.” 615 In Protecting Your Collection: A Handbook, Survey, & Guide for the Security of Rare
Books, Manuscripts, Archives, & Works of Art, Gandert suggests that a possible implication of
replevin is that collectors will choose to destroy records rather than incur the litigation costs of
replevin. 616 In the case of the Journal of the Convention, there was concern that Hook would
destroy the record rather than allow the state to secure custody of it. This threat is consistent with
someone who views himself as having private property rights to a thing and, namely, the right to
alienate it. The generality of the perception that collectors are willing to destroy records did not
emerge from this study. This is the one instance of such a threat located in this dissertation
research.
Isle of Wight Records
The case of the Isle of Wight records involves a character now familiar to the readers of this
dissertation. In 1993, Hamilton approached a curator at the Isle of Wight Museum and inquired
whether he would be interested in purchasing for the museum 57 documents for $10,000.
Hamilton himself, by calling attention to his cache of records, sparked the set of events that
followed. When the Clerk of the Circuit Court in the Isle of Wight County, the legal custodian of
public records of Isle of Wight County, learned of Hamilton’s sales pitch, he wrote to Manarin,
who was simultaneously involved with the case against Hamilton in Middlesex County, to

request direction, pointing to the Library of Virginia’s role as a resource for local records
custodians in their replevin activities.” 617
This case is particularly notable in illustrating how the court opinion influenced both the
identification stage of the replevin process and the nature of the negotiations. When the Isle of
Wight County challenged Hamilton’s ownership the records, Hamilton’s attorney described the
applicability of what he called “Judge Person’s three prong test.” He wrote to the attorney for the
Isle of Wight County that “the County may prove that a document is a county public record by
convincingly showing that:
1. A particular document is of a type a statute required the Clerk to keep….
2. A particular document was retained by a Clerk and the specific circumstance
surrounding its removal demonstrate the removal was wrongful…
3. A particular document satisfied the Coleman definition of public record.” 618
In North Carolina, the burden for proving ownership rests on the holder of the property. With the
judge’s decision in Middlesex County et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store,
private parties and their legal counsel are able to argue it falls to Virginia’s public officials to
demonstrate ownership.
The county attorney for the Isle of Wight County, working in consultation with the
Assistant Attorney General, wanted to avoid having the court decide custody. Among public
officials, there was a strong expectation that such a route would once again split the records and
result in “no total victory for either side.” 619 Because Hamilton wanted to make money in this –
dealing in manuscripts was his business – the state and county officials had to make a concession
if they wanted to avoid litigation. They needed to compensate Hamilton.

For this compensation to happen, the county officials had to assemble the funds. For this,
they turned to the Library of Virginia, revealing another occasional role for the agency. In
addition to providing advisory services to local governments, the state officials may also be
involved in monetarily backing the terms of the custody determination. 620The matter of
compensation, as seen in the Pennsylvania chapter, was accompanied by careful language from
the public officials. Manarin wrote to the Assistant Attorney General of Virginia, “It should be
pointed out to Mr. Hamilton that he cannot “sell” the documents, since they are public records.
What we have offered is to compensate him for taking care of and for keeping the documents in
good condition” 621 Because the county officials were asserting public ownership, they did not
view this as a governmental taking and the payment constitutionally required. Their position was
that the county was recovering property that belonged to the public and that the compensation
was a necessary courtesy to bring the matter to a conclusion.
This case, settled between the county and Hamilton through the assistance of the Library
of Virginia, illustrates how a court opinion can shape the nature of negotiations and custody
determinations. The public officials approached the case differently than they had as a
consequence 622

The Papers of James S. Gilmore
This final and most recent case involves the papers of former Virginia Governor James S.
Gilmore, who held office from January 17, 1998 to January 12, 2002. 623 Although the general
public may not readily recognize replevin as a familiar term, the Gilmore papers case is an
example of replevin permeating popular media sources. This section is formed through a study of
statute and newspaper reports contemporary to the Library of Virginia’s efforts to secure the
transfer of the complete collection of Governor Gilmore’s records.
Another section of the Code of Virginia is at the crux of this recovery effort. Section 2.2126 states the following, “Before the end of his term of office, the Governor shall have delivered
to The Library of Virginia for safekeeping all correspondence and other records of his office
during his term. This section shall not apply to correspondence or other records of a strictly
personal or private nature, or active files necessary for the transaction of business by the Office
of the Governor, the decision thereon to be made by the Governor after consultation with the
Librarian of Virginia.” 624 Staff from the Library of Virginia did indeed meet with Gilmore to
discuss the transfer of the records, but what arrived at the doorstep of the Library was an
incomplete collection. Particularly glaring was the absence of records documenting gifts to
Gilmore, clemency records, and the gubernatorial records in response to the attack on the
Pentagon on September 11, 2001. 625
This, the Library of Virginia argued was in violation of the Code of Virginia. While the
Code allows the Governor to purge his or her corpus of documents of any papers that are strictly

personal in nature, the Library officials and the Governor evidently interpreted this allowance
very differently, leading to an eleven-month back and forth between the state and the nowprivate citizen. When the Library of Virginia confronted him about the gaps in his
documentation, Gilmore argued that none of the materials he withheld “fell under any definition
of archivable public records.” 626 Moreover, as he asserted in an editorial in The Richmond Times
Dispatch, Gilmore believed that his executive privilege allowed him to use his discretion. He
wrote, “Virginia law allows an outgoing Governor to keep ‘records of a personal or private
nature’ and states clearly that the Governor, and no one else, decides which documents are
private. There's a reason for this rule: A Governor's staff wants to know that their frank,
unvarnished advice will remain private. Virtually all of the remaining documents in my
possession were created for my private consideration.” 627 Officials in the Library of Virginia and
the Attorney General’s Office disagreed strongly with this interpretation. The Chairman of the
Library Board argued that records are not personal just because a public official wants them to
be. “Even if a Governor reads these documents in private,” he said,” they still are public records
because he reads them in his capacity as Governor.” 628
On November 18, 2002, months after the initial transfer and through the assistance of a
mediator, the Library of Virginia acquired the remainder of the records. 629 Per directives in the
Code of Virginia, records like the clemency files, which Gilmore originally withheld, have
access restriction in place. 630 Others were restricted as a result of an agreement between the

2015. 631 This agreement marked the formal conclusion of this replevin custody.
Attorney General Anthony F. Troy, who represented the Library of Virginia in this case,
told reporters that “had the Gilmore matter gone to court, the focus would have shifted from
Gilmore's conduct as governor to that as private citizen. ‘No private citizen should be holding
public documents,’ Troy said.” 632 Although his office has been less inclined to pursue replevin
cases that target more historical materials and cases where the mode of loss is unclear, Troy
holds to the principle of inalienability with this succinct statement to the press. Chapter Seven of
this dissertation argues that public officials are motivated to recover public records because of a
responsibility to the public they serve, rather than because of any sort of malevolence or greed. It
is the responsibility of the Library of Virginia to hold Gilmore’s administration accountable to
the public by preserving and making available the administration’s records.

VI.D. SUMMARY
It was not possible to tell the story of replevin in Virginia by studying the Library of Virginia
alone. This is a state where replevin more frequently occurs on the local level with the
involvement of circuit court clerk but, even then, such cases do not occur very often. The
researcher’s assumption beginning the study of replevin in Virginia was that the state would fall

somewhere between North Carolina and Pennsylvania in terms of how actively and successfully
records are recovered. In studying the history of replevin and the contemporary approaches to
recovery in the state, Virginia as a case looks more like Pennsylvania and less like North
Carolina in the years following the court decision in Middlesex County et al. v. Jack Hamilton,
d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store.
In Dow’s text, she maintains that “most” dealers and collectors “reject claims against
those materials for which governments can show no evidence that the archives ever held
them.” 633 In Virginia, like in Pennsylvania, public officials have the most success in eliciting the
support of legal counsel when it is apparent that the archives once had physical custody of an
alienated record. As part of the identification stage of the replevin process, the Director of
Description Services said that the Library staff does research “just to see if we could pinpoint
and find evidence that it was ever here. If we could find it on microfilm from the 1950s, then I’m
sure the Attorney General would pursue it, because we could say, ‘we’ve had it here and it’s
gone.’ I can’t ever remember that being the case.” 634 This stands in direct contrast to replevin in
North Carolina today. The Department of Cultural Resources, supported by legal counsel in the
Department of Justice, has a history of success in recovering records that were never in the
archives. Again, it was not always this way in Virginia. In the cases involving the Lossing papers
and the Journal of the Convention, the mode of loss was not known. The public officials
involved in these cases pursued them and pursued them successfully. A weakened inclination
among public officials, both the record custodians and legal counsel in the Attorney General’s
Office, to attempt to recover records that never reached the archives was a consequence of the
state’s mixed success in Middlesex County et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a Hamilton's Book Store.

There are perceptible contrasts in how different eras of leadership in Virginia have
responded to the discovery of records in private hands. What this reveals about replevin is that
when players change, replevin activities change. In the earlier part of the century, replevin had
the backing of officials in high places in Virginia. The Governor’s Office, for example, took
interest in both the Lossing papers cases, which were resolved at the turn of the 20th century, and
the Journal of the Convention case, settled in 1942. The interest of leadership like the Governor
was likely connected to the fact that the state’s records program was in its nascent form at this
period in time. The state suffered serious wartime losses of its records and public officials were
trying to bring order and avoid, to paraphrase the Report of the Committee on the Records of
Government, losing the state’s memory completely. 635
Manarin, State Archivist from 1970 to 1995, earned a reputation as an aggressor among
the private collecting community. Following Middlesex County et al. v. Jack Hamilton, d/b/a
Hamilton's Book Store, the Manuscript Society published a caustic description of Manarin’s
replevin efforts and posited that the court opinion would hinder him in the future. S.L. Carson
wrote, “The Archivist of the State of Virginia, Dr. Louis Manarin, can no longer march into a
home or shopkeeper’s place of business as sole judge and jury and in effect, use Louis XIV’s
famous quote, ‘I am the State,’ to seize private property peremptorily.” 636 The outcome in the
case against Hamilton, coupled with Manarin’s departure from the Library, ushered in a changed
period for replevin. Public officials still demonstrate a commitment to recovery and, thus, to
governmental openness. Today, there is a less of an inclination to demand custody of records and
more of an inclination to negotiate custody. The exception to this tendency was the hard-line

VII. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

VII.A. A REFLECTION ON REPLEVIN AND THE PUBLIC GOOD
This study drew upon interviews and records to trace the contours of the replevin process in three
jurisdictions. The historical and contemporary case studies analyzed within these pages illustrate
varied processes even within the same state and reveal that replevin activities are largely
dependent on the priorities and interests of public officials within the state archives and the state
attorney general offices. This was a clear finding in this study. The people in power – both in the
state archives and in the Attorney General’s Offices – have tremendous influence on the activity
and inactivity of the replevin program in the state. Replevin is handled differently across time
and administrations.
This dissertation began with an understanding of replevin as attempts by government
archives to regain custody of public records in the possession of private parties. The term
“replevin” refers to three types of recovery cases involving public records:
•
•
•

Recovery that enters litigation but where ownership is settled between parties;
Recovery that enters litigation and where ownership is determined by the
court;
Recovery that does not involve the court system and where ownership is
settled between parties.

227

The dissertation concludes with an understanding of replevin that can be most succinctly stated
as follows: Replevin describes government efforts to recover selected public records or publically
owned records that are in private hands. Such efforts may involve the courts but are most
commonly settled by the parties involved. Public archives do not, as this dissertation
demonstrated, pursue all records that are in private hands. Just as there is a pattern to the replevin
process, conceived as a six-stage process in this dissertation, there is a pattern to the types of
public records that, when alienated, are most likely to be the subject of a replevin effort. States in
this study pursued records that are “archival,” meaning they are permanent according to retention
schedules, and that fill a gap in the existing collection. The cases presented, with few exceptions,
focused on records that predated 1900 and that were in the custody of a private individual or
auction house. Today, state archives in Pennsylvania and Virginia are less inclined to pursue
records that are out of state and cases where it is unclear whether a government office actually
received or created the record in question. Moreover, state archives employees in these states
may find it more difficult to convince their legal counsel to support a recovery effort where the
record has low financial value or where it was never in the archival repository.
C.B. Macpherson identifies two usages of the word “property.” In its colloquial use,
property is synonymous with “things,” with public records serving as the “things” of interest in
this dissertation. The legal field, however, understands property as “not things but rights, rights
in or to things” and the notion of a “bundle of rights” remains the dominant paradigm. 637 The
people are the owners of public records. The Deputy Secretary of Cultural Resources certainly
captured this point when he defined replevin as “the action taken to retrieve property belonging
to the people that are out of the hands of the people.” 638 The general populace, however, does not
637
638

228

exercise all of the incidents or the entire bundle of rights that property theorists describe. We
have the right to use the thing -- the collection of public records in a public archives. We as
users, however, do not have the ability to exclude others of the right to use the thing. We
certainly do not have the right to discard the thing at our own discretion. Public property is an
unusual category of property and involves trust. The public expects that the state will be stewards
of the public property and that the state is committed to providing indiscriminate access to the
general public. 639
Margaret Davies says, “property serves as a lens into a social order.” 640 The property
issues at the heart of this dissertation do just that. In her chapter in Cox and Wallace’s edited
volume Archives and the Public Good, Anne Van Camp, asserts that a “hallmark of a society’s
openness is the degree of public access to the archives and records of its government.” 641 While
news stories consistently challenge the notion of governmental transparency in the United States,
our public archives are built on a premise of providing access to public records, records that
provide evidence of government decision-making and that hold public officials accountable for
actions. Replevin is directly in line with this mission.
During the State of North Carolina v. B.C. West Jr. case, there were archivists and private
collectors and dealers alike who leveled criticism against the state’s efforts to recover the bills of
indictment, characterizing it as overzealous, unethical, and even unconstitutional. West’s
attorney, in questioning State Archivist Mitchell in the case heard in the Superior Court,
suggested that the Department of Cultural Resources was acting with “proprietary” interests in

mind and was moved by greed rather than concern for public access to evidence. 642 This was not
the impression that emerged from the study of the historical and contemporary replevin activities
in three state archives.
The public officials interviewed and studied in this dissertation view recovery of public
records as a responsibility that they must bear. A statement by the Deputy Secretary of the
Department of Cultural Resources conveys this best. Cherry said,
There is a difference in preserving the record to provide information
about the activities of government than there is preserving the record
of history that is separate from government actions. It’s especially
important for a democracy. If we can’t have a record showing what
our elected officials have done -- if they can easily be taken …out of
the hands of the people, then we are losing our ability for individuals
to control our government. And writing history is a form of controlling
government. If you are not given the fuel to have the ability to interpret
the past… and you don’t have that evidence because someone else is
holding it in their private collection somewhere, you are being denied
your rights as a citizen. 643
Each state archives exhibited an adherence to these words through the actions of their staffs. The
disinclination to pursue records in existing archival collections suggests that proprietary interests
certainly do not drive replevin activities. As Mitchell suggested, records that are in other archival
collections are removed from their context, diminishing, he argued, their archival integrity. This
situation may not be the ideal from the perspective of either the public archivist or of the user.
They are, however, still available to the members of the public who desire to understand an
action or decision by the government. Records that are in a private individual’s custody are not
accessible, or if they are, the availability is at the discretion of that individual. The very existence
of the records may not even be known, as illustrated by this dissertation’s discussion of the
discovery stage in the replevin process. Public archivists, very simply, want to facilitate public

access to public information. The motivation behind replevin is an effort to benefit the public
good.
Davies’ understanding of property as a means for viewing social order is applicable when
considering the objections that critics have historically leveled against replevin. Americans live
in a society that values government openness and accountability, but they also a part of a society
that values private ownership rights. Still, this dissertation pointed to a softening in the criticism
against public officials’ efforts to reconnect the public with their property. While the Manuscript
Society’s Replevin Committee retains a fund to support individuals who find themselves
involved in what the committee views as an unjust replevin, the chair of the Replevin Committee
said that the membership understands there are just replevin cases and they weigh the merits of
both claims before supporting the private holder. 644
The public can find good reasons to distrust the government. Replevin is not one of those
things. As the North Carolina court system reviewed the case against West, Charles Hamilton
said the following: “[North Carolina’s success] will set a precedent for other states. Every public
and university library, every historical society, every collector and dealer will be fair game for
state historians. Your own collection may be looted by North Carolina or other states or even by
the Federal government. Scholarship will be set back a century. Every card catalogue in every
library will have to be overhauled.” 645 Of course, this did not happen. The Department of
Cultural Resources may indeed be a bulldog in this area, but they – and indeed the other two
states studied here -- are not motivated by greed and they are not simply trying to protect their
turf. Instead, this “dogged” commitment to recovery is for the good of the people.

This dissertation challenges the conceptualization of replevin as a process that involves
two camps of players, one that includes public archivists and the other dealers and collectors.
Collectors can be partners to public archivists, bringing alienated items to their attention, and, in
each of these states, public archivists show discretion in what they pursue and a willingness to
cooperate, whether it be with acknowledgements of donations or “care and keeping” fees. There
is movement and collaboration between these camps.
There is another, very important, camp that is influenced by replevin activities: its
composition is the general populace. Among the records that public archivists preserve and
recover are papers that carry the signatures of our founding fathers or that document
governmental decisions during the Civil War. Others are less removed in time but are no less
important. These records may have a lower market value, but high evidential value, documenting
the actions of contemporary public employees and elected officials in matters of great public
importance. It is troubling to imagine an alternate version of the conclusion to the Gilmore
papers case, one in which the Library of Virginia officials and the state’s Attorney General
happily accepted the papers the Governor’s office originally transferred. Had this been the case,
there would be large – and deliberate -- gaps in the evidence. The hypothetical becomes all the
more troubling when one realizes that Gilmore had considered a run for the Republican
presidential nomination in 2008. Without proper enforcement of public records laws, public
employees and elected leaders could erase evidence at a whim. The public should want archivists
to pursue alienated records and archivists should have the aid of legal counsel in Attorney
General’s offices. They should be and must “bulldogs” in this matter.
Staff at the three state archives were open about replevin activities, further evidencing
that they are motivated by a commitment to the public and not, as select members of the

232

Manuscript Society have sometimes suggested, any nefarious reasons. The individuals that
participated in this study were candid and willing to speak with a member of the public who
wanted to learn about the decision-making and processes within their institution. The State of
North Carolina was particularly notable in fulfilling records requests and facilitating my ability
to study this topic in doing so. While I was in Raleigh, for example, I expressed interest in
studying the Department of Justice’s file on the George Washington letter case. As the record
request, included in Appendix B, illustrates, this was approved within minutes, thanks to the
assistance of the Special Deputy Attorney General in expediting it. This much was clear in
conducting the research: none of these institutions are trying to withhold information about their
efforts to recover public records.

VII.B. FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN RESEARCH
During the preparation of the dissertation proposal, George Bain’s article on state archival law,
published by the American Archivist in 1983, was a useful, but dated, resource. In the area of
replevin, there have been changes to the legislative landscape in which state archives recover
public records in private hands. Moreover, in contrast to today, email communication was not the
prevalent form of communication among state employees at the time of Bain’s writing. An
application of Bain’s methodology to the current public records statutes would be of value to
both public employees and the larger archival community. This study will be among my future
projects.
This dissertation focuses on ownership of government records in the analog and the
traditional understanding of replevin as the recovery of original records. My next project will

233

probe what replevin may look like in a digital context. The latter question is relevant in an age
when public sector employees conduct much of their business correspondence through their
email. The management of these records is complicated by the use of private email addresses and
alias accounts, a practice that, on the federal level, was the subject of a House Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform hearing in September 2013. At this time, the Archivist of the
United States testified federal employees may, when necessary, use private email accounts for
government business, but must adhere to federal records laws and records retention schedules. 646
There are frequent stories, however, of public officials in all levels of government failing to
comply with public records management requirements, prompting the questions of how these
emails can be retrieved and made discoverable and how this type of behavior may be
discouraged.
At the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing in September, three
individuals testified on their use of private email accounts and alias email accounts for matters of
public business. Their testimonies provided some insight into what would prompt a public
official to use personal email accounts, though the motivations that the individuals offered may
have been fabricated to hide more clandestine reasons. One individual, a former executive
director of the Loan Programs Office at the Department of Energy, cited a lack of understanding
of retention schedules and private email accounts and, at the same time, described the “old and
cumbersome” nature of the his Department’s information systems. 647 Another individual, the

former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission testified that there was an
absence of sufficient training on public records management. 648
I will draw upon the contacts I have developed through this dissertation research to focus
on this information challenge from the context of state government. My initial research in this
area will draw upon a framework that the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce
(DOC) employed in examining the use of private and alias email accounts for public business.
The following points of inquiry guided his investigation:
a) Whether it is possible to determine the extent personal email accounts are used
by DOC employees to conduct official business.
b) Whether DOC has procedures in place to collect, maintain, and access records
created by personal or alias email accounts.
c) Whether DOC has provided appropriate training for staff related to the use of
personal or alias email accounts.
d) Whether DOC has reprimanded, counseled, or taken administrative action
against any employees for using personal or alias email accounts.
e) Whether DOC officials have promoted or encouraged the use of personal or
alias emails for conducting official government business. 649
An application of such a framework to state agencies can inform an understanding of the
information behavior, systems, policy, and training in the public sector.
I am interested in approaching this records management challenge in several ways,
exploring strategies in the form of policies and curriculum development for public sector
employees. For those emails that have escaped, I would like to conceive of and develop a digital

replevin process. Additionally, I hope to engage in collaborative research with faculty colleagues
who have expertise in information systems design in order to probe whether there are limitations
in government communications systems that contribute to the use of personal email accounts.
We may consider developing a more robust information system or design modifications to
current systems in use.
The larger significance of the use of personal email accounts is this: if public employees
either choose to circumvent public records laws or do not fully understand the distinctions
between public and private records, the records may escape public custody and may not be
discoverable. The consequences may impede the public’s ability to hold their officials
accountable for their decisions and actions.
