PEOPLE’S PERCEPTIONS OF
GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT

Associate Professor

This dissertation focuses on the perceptions that young people have of federal
government websites and of the U.S. government, as well as exploring possible
connections between the perceptions of government and government websites. Not
only is this a virtually unstudied area of e-government and youth information
behavior, but it is also of critical importance as e-government becomes increasingly
necessary to Americans’ everyday lives.
The case study included 37 youth across four middle-schools in the midAtlantic U.S. who all participated in an after-school program at which they met once
per week for 10-12 weeks to research a health topic of interest. During these sessions,
they participated in several data collection activities, including an interview, a survey,

a word association activity, an evaluation of the homepage of a government website,
and card-sorting. The study also included over 60 hours of participant observation.
The study finds that while participants were slightly more likely to have a
negative perception of government than to have a positive one, the majority of
participants viewed e-government favorably. Perceptions were based on a variety of
factors, though perceptions of government were most commonly made through
assessments of policy, while perceptions of e-government most commonly focused on
the source of the information (i.e. the government). Perhaps most significantly, while
there was no overwhelming connection between overall perceptions of government
and e-government, participants’ views of information-related policies frequently were
raised during discussions about both government and e-government. More
specifically, participants focused on such issues as government secrecy, surveillance,
and the security of websites against hackers when evaluating government and egovernment. Overall, these findings shed light on the opinions of an understudied
population in e-government research, offer insight into political socialization as it
relates to government information, and inform both policy-makers and educators on
how to best disseminate government websites to youth.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
It is often said that it takes a village to raise a child. In my case, this applied to my
doctoral studies. To name everyone who contributed in some way to this dissertation
would take a document as long as the study itself. That said there are a number of
individuals who deserve to be singled-out here for their contributions to this work.
Firstly, my doctoral adviser Dr. Mega Subramaniam has been an incredible mentor
over the years. Her patience, guidance through academia, and knowledge of research
have been invaluable to my successful completion of the program. Likewise, my
honorary second adviser, Dr. Paul Jaeger, has treated me like a colleague over the
years, and I have learned an incalucuable amount of knowledge of the profession
because of this. Mega and Paul often acted as a tag team of coach and cheerleader,
and without their support I would not have had nearly the successes that I have had
over the years.
In addition to my advisers, this research could not have been done without the
dedicated librarians and students who participated in the study. I also had the help of
Dr. Beth St. Jean throughout the project, who offered invaluable career and editing
advice, meticulous field notes that were an asset to the data analysis, and enjoyable
conversations in traffic en route to the many after-school sessions we led.
Additionally, I had the support of an incredible research team including Rebecca
Follman, Christie Kodama, and Faith Ambrosini.

iii

The other members of my committee, Dr. Ann Weeks and Dr. Irwin Morris
have been supportive of my work and always willing to offer advice and feedback. I
also had the support of a more informal network of fellow students at UMD,
including Ursula Gorham, Kaitlin Peterson, Brian Real, and Amanda Waugh. Also
from the College, Dr. John Bertot and Dr. Ping Wang have been generous with their
time and expertise, offering research advice, opportunities for scholarships, and
general support throughout my doctoral program.
Outside of my program, I have been lucky enough to have a strong support
network of mentors, friends, and family. Dr. Karen O’Connor and Dr. Richard Cupitt
offered invaluable support in my early forays into academia. My friends, particularly
Jen Kirk, Jon Weakly, Ted Crocker, and Malorie Garrett were gracious about my
years-long descent into the dissertation and reminded me that I would actually have a
social life someday. My brother, Nicholas Greene taught me how to construct an
argument and gave me the musical education I needed to compile my 2000s Hip Hop
playlist (essential to the writing process!) My grandpartents offered gentle nudges to
finish so I could move closer and other extended family members gave me ample
opportunities to try to explain what it is exactly that I research.
My parents, Debbie and Matthew Greene gave me the mix of education, love,
care, and reading materials that is necessary for true success. Leroy and Molly offered
humor and snuggles, as well as reminders not to forget the important things in life
(cookies and fishies?) And finally, my husband, Brian, offered endless patience, love,
and support, and is a constant daily reminder of how lucky I am.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this dissertation is to understand the perceptions that a select group of
middle-school aged youth have of government and online government information. In
addition, the study examines whether young people’s perceptions of government are
connected to their perceptions of online government information. Finally, it explores
the practical impact of these findings through both the lenses of both policy and
education.

BACKGROUND OF THE RESEARCH
This study grew out of a larger research project (“Improving the Health Literacy,
Health-Related Self-Efficacy, and Long-Term Health Outlook of Disadvantaged
Youth through the Facilitation of Scientific Inquiry and Information Literacy Skills”)
(www.hackhealth.umd.edu), led by two University of Maryland professors, Drs.
Mega Subramaniam and Beth St. Jean, and funded by the National Library of
Medicine, during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years. In HackHealth, a semistructured after-school program, participants conducted online research into
personally relevant health topics. Serving as a student researcher on this study, I
observed that while many of the youth recognized the dot gov URL suffix as credible
(several citing teachers’ lessons on the subject), many of the participants did not
understand what dot gov (or government) meant. For example, one participant
explained that he trusted dot gov sites “Because …it’s the government… who’s
giving you…some facts that can help you out and you know you can trust him
1

because he’s well-known and he does serious work” (Subramaniam et al., 2015b, p.
563).
Other students preferred to use other websites for various reasons (e.g.
aesthetics, position in the Google search result list). A surprising number of students
also mentioned distrust in government as a reason not to use government websites.
While these observations were recorded and incorporated into other research analyses
(e.g. Subramaniam et al., 2015b), there seemed to be an opportunity to dig deeper into
all of these occurrences and investigate the understudied phenomena of youth and egovernment.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Although e-government and youth information-seeking behavior are both robust areas
of research, to date there have been few, if any, published studies examining the
perceptions that young people have of government websites. Existing studies discuss
the educative value of government websites for instruction (Bisland, 2009), list
existing government websites for youth (Wilke & Keith, 2004), or describe how
youth can act as co-designers with government agencies in designing these sites
(Harrison, Zappen, & Adali, 2005; National Park Service, n.d.). Despite the fact that
some youth seem to connect dot gov websites with credible information
(Subramaniam et al., 2015b), it is unclear whether this is the case for all, or even most
youth, or the reasons young people have for trusting these websites. There is almost
no research available on youth preferences for these sites.

2

Furthermore, several recent studies cite the generational phenomena of young
people’s general distrust of institutions (Institute of Politics, 2015; Levitsky, 2014).
From the findings of these studies, as well as anecdotal accounts from young people
in the HackHealth 2013-2014 program, it seems there is the potential for this distrust
to begin to affect the way that young people use information provided by these
institutions. This study seeks to add to prior research on source credibility by
exploring possible connections between perceptions and trust of government and
perceptions and trust of e-government and by identifying possible effects that distrust
may have on young people’s use of and access to government information.

OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS
At the outset of the study, there were two main goals identified: 1) To develop an
understanding of the perceptions these young people have of government and egovernment and 2) To observe connections between perceptions of government and
perceptions of e-government. The following two questions guided both the design of
the study and the analysis of the data:
1. What are HackHealth participants’ perceptions of government?
2. What are HackHealth participants’ perceptions of e-government?

SCOPE OF THE STUDY
The data for this dissertation were collected during sessions of the second year of
HackHealth (2014-2015), the aforementioned after-school program designed “to
increase the interest of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in the health
3

sciences and to improve their ability to look for and evaluate health-related
information, their health-related literacy and self-efficacy, and their ultimate health
outcomes” (Subramaniam et al., 2014). Not only was this an accessible population in
terms of IRB-approval, location, and school permission, these youth were selfselected as interested in research and thus were amenable to participating in the data
collection needed for this study.
Thirty-seven youth from four middle-schools in a mid-Atlantic (U.S.) school
district participated in the program’s second year, which was run by the HackHealth
researchers from the University of Maryland and school librarians at these schools.
The program was held weekly for 10-12 weeks at each school within the months of
December 2014-May 2015. Table 1.1 shows additional data on each school’s
population and demographics.

STUDY METHODOLOGY
As a graduate research associate on the main HackHealth study, I served as a
facilitator to the students. Simultaneously, I collected data as the sole author of this
dissertation, an exploratory case study carried out within the context of the
HackHealth after-school program. I used data collected from a variety of instruments,
including five tools used in the HackHealth program generally - a survey, semistructured interviews, a health literacy assessment tool, a credibility screenshot
activity, and a card-sorting exercise.For the survey and the interview protocol,
questions specific to this dissertation were added. From the health literacy assessment
tool and credibility screenshot activity, only particular elements of the data that were
relevant to this dissertation were used. Data were also drawn from a government and
e-government word association activity, as well as over 60 hours of participant
observation and audio-recorded sessions. The data from this case study were explored
using content analysis techniques to gain an understanding of these participants’
perceptions of government and e-government.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY
The main contribution of this study is to the research areas of youth information
behavior and e-government. While several researchers have explored the way that
young people search for and select online resources, fewer studies examine the ways
5

that personal beliefs affect these searches. To my knowledge, none explore the way
that young people’s political and civic beliefs affect perceptions of governmentcreated or sponsored websites. Studies of e-government have explored the ways that
trust in government and trust in e-government may be connected (Chee-Week,
Bensabat, & Cenfetelli, 2008; Smith, 2010; Tolbert & Mossberger, 2006; Welsh,
Hinnant, & Jae Moon, 2005; West, 2004), but none have examined this phenomenon
in the context of young people. This dissertation adds another layer to what we know
of youth information-seeking behavior. It also gives insight into young people’s
perception of e-government.
In addition, this study carries practical implications. With a better
understanding of the connection between knowledge, belief, and actions regarding
government websites, educators can better tailor their lessons on credibility. The use
of dot gov as a shorthand to credibility may have a negative impact on the efficacy of
the overall credibility lesson if youth have negative perceptions of e-government or
government in general. Civic education accompanying the use of dot gov resources
may be necessary as well. Also, by seeing the barriers that youth face to accessing
this information, government agencies can review ways to better meet young people’s
perceptions of relevance and usefulness, accommodate various barriers to access, and
appeal to young people who lack trust in government institutions. These are important
considerations for all audiences, but particularly for youth, as a lack of trust, usability
or belief in relevance could negatively affect future information behavior related to
the use of e-government.

RATIONALE FOR STUDYING YOUTH
The use of government websites is replacing in-person or analog applications for a
variety of government services, including school enrollment, social service
applications, and requirements for visas (Bertot, McClure, & Jaeger, 2008; Gibson,
Bertot, & McClure, 2009; Holt & Holt, 2010). While many of these uses are primarily
the focus of adults, youth increasingly act as intermediaries for their parents (Becker,
Crandall, Fisher, Kinney, Landry, & Rocha, 2010). Youth are also expected to
navigate such college-related documents as the Free Application for Federal Student
Aid (FAFSA) and other federal student loan applications, all online. Discovering
what young people perceive online government information to be may help us
understand the education needed to enable future use of these resources.
Additionally, studying younger adolescents is important because they are on
the cusp of Piaget’s concrete operational and formal operational stages. As they cross
over these stages, they begin to think beyond specific concepts, experiences, or
artifacts and instead begin to process abstractly (Piaget & Inhelder, 1969). By
examining the ways in which this age group perceive government and e-government,
and the connections they make between the two, we gain insight into how these
thoughts may develop as they become older, more active members of civic life.
Finally, many of the themes that arise during discussions of government and
online government information with youth are directly relevant to the social studies
standards in their school curriculum. Objectives such as having students examine the
effect of media on political life, analyzing texts for biases and point of view, and
7

thinking about the need for government protection during threats to national security
all factor into their perceptions of government and government information. Table 1.2

EXPLANATION OF KEY CONCEPTS AND TERMS
INFORMATION
To define information, I borrow from Eliza Dresang (2005): “In this study,
‘Information’ refers to the ideas or thoughts that individuals contribute, seek, or
obtain from informal or formal discussion, investigation, or study” (p. 179).
E-GOVERNMENT
E-government is a broad concept encompassing the web-based technology used by
governments to improve communication and services for citizens, government
employees, and those working with governments (Davies, 2002; Hernon, Reylea,
Dugan, & Cheverie, 2002; see Yildiz, 2004 for a comprehensive review). This
dissertation uses the term more narrowly, focusing on government websites,
specifically websites with a dot gov URL that are produced by (or at the behest of)
the United States federal government. The terms online government information,

10

government websites, dot gov websites, and e-government are used interchangeably
throughout.
GOVERNMENT
In political science literature, the concept of government is often separated into the
idea of specific government (an individual, a party, a specific Congress) and the
institution of government (timeless in the sense that it refers to a concept instead of
any specificity). In this study, I use both definitions. Instruments were designed for
youth to tell the researcher how she or he defines government without suggestion of
either idea. When the distinction is important to the findings and/or discussion, it will
be made clear.
PERCEPTION
Perception is used as a way to describe the participants’ definitions of government
and e-government, as well as their feelings toward the institutions and dot gov URL.
These feelings encompass perceived trust and usefulness, as well as prior beliefs on
both government and e-government that participants bring to the study.
YOUTH
Although “youth” can certainly represent any number of age groups, this study uses
the term to indicate the age of the participants in the after-school program during
which the data were collected. These participants ranged in ages from 10-14 years
old. Participants will be referred to collectively as young adolescents, HackHealth
participants, youth, or simply participants.

STRUCTURE OF DISSERTATION
This dissertation is presented in seven chapters. Following this introduction, chapter
two discusses the literature related to information behavior, trust in and perception of
government, and e-government, with a specific focus on young people when
appropriate. Chapter three describes the methodology used in the data collection and
analysis for this study, including a more detailed description of the study’s
participants. Chapters four and five examine the findings from the data in detail.
Chapter four focuses on the data in aggregate, while chapter five focuses on five
participants in detail. Chapter six discusses the key findings that emerged from the
data and offers implications and recommendations to policy-makers and educators.
Chapter seven concludes the dissertation with a summary of findings, limitations to
the study, and suggestions for future research.

CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
Although there is a distinct lack of research on young people’s understanding and
perceptions of e-government resources, there is a large body of work on youth
information behavior, as well as research on young people’s general feelings toward
civic life and trust in social institutions. These two areas of research are summarized
in this chapter. To give context to the discussion of youth-specific information
behavior, this chapter begins with a review of several models and theories of
information behavior consulted for and incorporated into the study. Following this, a
discussion of the role of source credibility in Internet search is included. Additionally,
research on the context of the e-government field of research is explored (specifically
in how it influences youth use of government websites). The chapter culminates in a
description of the conceptual framework used to guide this study, drawn from the
models, theories, and prior research discussed.

MODELS AND THEORIES OF INFORMATION BEHAVIOR
This section reviews several seminal models and theories of information behavior
relevant to this study. The models and theories identified below have been chosen
because they address at least one of the three following requirements: there is a focus
on the user, there is a focus on the context of the search, and/or there is a focus on
online information. Although many of these models focus on information-seeking
behavior – the actions taken during the search process – and this dissertation focuses
more on the underlying beliefs, situations, and attitudes that influence this behavior,
the models discussed below describe the type of information search about which
13

participants were asked during data collection – active, purposive, and non-linear. An
additional caveat is that many of these models and theories have been developed
through research with adults; however, they have had enough impact on the field of
information studies to tie back to studies on youth information behavior and overall
have important implications on how this study frames the context of the search
process.
UNDERSTANDING INFLUENCES ON INFORMATION BEHAVIOR
Ross Todd (2003) conceptualizes the field of information behavior as:
“people's information contexts, information needs, information seeking
behaviors, patterns of information access, retrieval and dissemination, human
information processing, and information use. Related concepts include
sources, uncertainty, and satisfaction. Its theory building, research, and
development are based on the belief that information is essential to the
functioning and interaction of individuals, social groups, organizations, and
societies, and to the ongoing improvement of the quality of life. Underpinning
this is the belief that information has the potential to change what people
already know and to shape their decisions and actions.” (p. 27)
This summary and the assumptions within this definition are informed by a variety of
models and theories developed over the last few decades. Wilson’s 1996 Model of
Information Behavior illustrates the various intervening variables that may influence
information-seeking behavior, including psychological, demographic, role-related or
interpersonal, environmental, and source characteristics.

Other models further discuss contextualizing factors. Dervin’s (1983) Sense-making
Framework, for example, views all information as essentially a product of humans’
observations, and thus subjective. This approach “posits information seeking and use
not as ‘Transmitting’ activity...Rather, information seeking and use are posited as
‘constructing’ activities -- as personal creating of sense. It is assumed that all
information is simply the sense made by individuals at specific moments in timespace” (Dervin, 1983, n.p.). This view of information behavior underlies many of the
assumptions we make about the influences on information seeking; as people
15

construct the world around them, they view information sources and information
artifacts differently.
Chatman’s (1996) Theory of Information Poverty theorizes that an
individual’s environment shapes his or her view of information. In this theory,
Chatman outlines six propositions about impoverished information small worlds
(distinct within the larger population lifeworld), including: 1) the belief that the
information poor perceive a lack of helpful sources, 2) class is related to information
poverty in that the information rich withhold access to information, 3) self-protective
norms are instituted as responses to social norms, 4) mistrust of information providers
guides the self-protecting actions of secrecy and deception, 5) the belief of negative
outcomes from sharing true problems, and finally 6) new knowledge is introduced as
responses to everyday problems, but is only allowed in selectively. Again, this theory
shows how the context of people’s lives shapes their attitudes and perceptions of
information. Chatman (1991) proposes that these small worlds create insiders and
outsiders to the larger lifeworld of information in a society. As described, the
outsiders may exist because of both imposed forces and self-guided choices, “for
example… they may only access Web pages with information that agrees with their
current point of view” (Jaeger & Thompson, 2005, p. 100). Important for this study,
the norms of the small world can strongly shape members from young ages (Berger &
Luckmann, 1967; Chatman, 1991; Jaeger & Thompson, 2005).

The Sense-making approach of conceiving information behavior has produced
theories devoted to the situation or context of the environment in which it takes place.
Everyday Life Information Seeking (ELIS), as conceived by Savolainen (1995), is
16

considered “nonwork” information seeking and is oriented around the way of life
(general structure of one’s day), mastery of life (attitude toward life), and situational
factors (e.g. lack of time) (see Figure 2.2).

17

Based on empirical research, Savolainen (1995) emphasizes that the orientation one
has toward problem-solving (or “mastery of life”) is essential to the understanding of
the behavior; “Taken independently and without a proper consideration of the
characteristics of cultural or cognitive ‘equipment’ of the information seeker being
manifest in his or her way of life, situational factors offer a rather abstract picture of
ELIS processes” (p. 290).
Imposed Query, a theory developed in 1995 by Gross, builds on the idea,
present in library and information science research for decades, of information search
as related to formal environments, such as work and school. Gross attempts to break
down the imposed query, or the information search that takes place “not because
[searchers] have identified an information need themselves, but because they have
been set on that course by another,” into stages, beginning with the passage of the
query from the imposer to the searcher and ending with the understanding of the
imposer from the understanding presented by the searcher (p. 236).
Spink & Cole (2001) differentiate the two types of search by describing the
environments and outcomes of the search:
In occupational or school information seeking, the user is seeking information
in a controlled environment with a definite end product that has some sort of
paradigmatic quality to it. ELIS, on the other hand, is fluid, depending on the
motivation, education, and other characteristics of the multitude of ordinary
people seeking information for a multitude of aspects of everyday life. (p.
301)

18

Regardless of the context, however, the searcher still brings his or her personal beliefs
and prior knowledge to the search. The difference in motivation may result in a
different choice of site (e.g. a blog for a personal health question versus a reputable
health website for a school assignment), but a searcher still retains his or her biases
and preferences. The ways that youth interact in these ways, specifically in the digital
environment, are described in further detail below.
Other models, such as those found in Kuhlthau (1991) and Johnson, Andrews,
& Allard (2001), further describe active search, incorporating detailed phases,
functions, stages and attitudes. Kuhlthau’s (1991) model of the information-seeking
process focuses on the feelings, thoughts, and actions associated with each stage of,
what she terms, the information search process (ISP). Derived from empirical studies
with, originally, high school and college aged youth, Kuhlthau (1991) identified six
stages of information seeking, each with associated feelings (affective realm),
thoughts (cognitive realm), and actions (physical realm), all represented in Table 2.1.

Johnson’s Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking (see Figure 2.3) is
useful not only for the fact that it is focused on health information seeking, but also
for the clarity of the way it shows how intervening factors affect the informationseeking process. Developed first in his study cancer-related everyday life information
seeking, the model “focuses on the antecedents that explain why people become
information seekers, the information carriers that shape the intention to seek
information, and the information-seeking actions that determine the development of
an individual's information field” (Johnson et al., 2001, p. 339).) The researchers
describe the antecedents as “factors that determine an individual's natural
predisposition to search for information from particular information carriers…
demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs” (p. 339). The next phase
involves information carriers, which are the different channels a person can use to
20

access information. Johnson et al. (2001) cite the work of Rice, McCreadie, & Chang
(2001) and Archea (1977) on the concept of information fields, which he describes as
“the resources, constraints, and carriers of information that define the sources that
influence people during their information seeking” (p. 341). Finally, the model
converges into actions, which are based on the factors above.

Johnson, Case, Andrews, Allard, and Johnson (2006) further distinguish an
information field from information pathways. Pathways are “the route[s] someone
follows in the pursuit of answers to questions,” and include the more “dynamic and
active” choices that individuals make when pursuing information through “channels,
sources, and messages” (p. 572). Fields are more static, typically consisting both of
communication networks and information devices. In this way, information fields are
somewhat similar to Chatman’s (1991) small worlds; Johnson et al. (2006) describe
individuals as being “embedded in a physical world that involves recurring contacts
with an interpersonal network of friends and/or family. They are also regularly
21

exposed to the same mediated communication channels (company news bulletins,
local newspapers, television news, and so on)” (p. 571).
THE ROLE OF WEB CREDIBILITY IN INFORMATION BEHAVIOR
The above models of information search discuss the various preceding and
interceding factors that influence search, including, but not limited to, attitudes,
motivations, beliefs, and knowledge. The sub-field of credibility research focuses
largely on the factors that influence a searcher’s trust in a source. Rieh (2010) defines
credibility as “an intuitive and complex concept,” but identifies trustworthiness and
expertise as critical components. Trustworthiness is defined as “the perceived
goodness and morality of the source…The perception that a source is fair, unbiased,
and truthful,” while an evaluation of expertise “reflects perceived knowledge, skill
and experience of the source” (pp. 1337-1338). Web credibility is differentiated from
other sources because of the non-physical nature of the Internet, as well as the multilayered nature of websites (e.g. finding an author may not be as easy as in traditional
sources like books) (Flanagin and Metzger, 2008).
There are two general stages that individuals take when assessing a website’s
credibility (Rieh, 2002). Predictive credibility judgments occur when the searcher is
still on a search result page. The individual relies on credibility judgments to decide
which page will meet his or her information need. After arriving on the page, the
searcher evaluates the website. If the evaluative credibility judgment does not match
what the predictive judgment projected it would be, the searcher most likely will
return to the search result page and repeat the process until the two judgments are the
same.
22

Source credibility, defined by Rieh and Belkin as an evaluation of “where a
document comes from,” has several facets (1998). Rieh and Belkin (1998) separate
these into two main categories, institutional and individual. The former includes such
characteristics as the URL suffix and the type or name of institution behind the site
(e.g. a college website or a website from Oxford University.) The individual level
focuses on the author of the site, including whether the person’s contact information
was available, the author’s credentials, and the familiarity of the author to the
searcher.
Though source credibility is the primary focus of this study, other types of
credibility influence searchers. These include message, media, presumed, reputed,
surface, and experienced credibility. Message credibility focuses on the content of the
information presented; media credibility is based on the platform of the message (e.g.
TV, web, newspaper, etc.), presumed credibility is based on a person’s preexisting
beliefs; reputed credibility is influenced by endorsements or referrals; surface
credibility relies on the website’s aesthetics; and experienced credibility relies on a
person’s experience with the source of the information (Rieh, 2010; Subramaniam, et
al., 2015b). Other types of credibility that could be important include conferred and
tabulated (Flanagin and Metzger, 2008; Rieh, 2010). Subramaniam and colleagues
(2015b) summarize these additional types of credibility as, respectively, trust in the
indirect source of the information and a reliance on aggregated ratings across multiple
users.
Relatively few studies have been conducted specifically on young people’s
online credibility assessment (Flanagin and Metzger, 2008; Rieh and Hilligoss, 2008).
23

Subramaniam et al. (2015b) found in a study with thirty youth aged 11-13 that the
tweens used several types of credibility to judge websites, including message
credibility through the identification of familiar words and language (i.e. Spanish);
media credibility through the availability of video, audio, pictures and social media
links; source credibility, by identifying sites with authoritative words like hospital and
doctor; reputed credibility through teacher-recommended and celebrity-endorsed
sites; and finally experienced credibility, when the youth had used the website or
other information from the author before. Other studies of youth credibility
preferences are covered more in the next section, situated within the larger context of
youth online information-seeking behavior.

YOUTH ONLINE INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR
The sections above illustrate the different stages, constructs, and contexts surrounding
information behavior. Except where noted, however, these models were created with
information gathered from adults. Because the focus of this dissertation is egovernment, and more directly, youths’ perceptions and anticipated interactions with
e-government, the following section will be limited to research that is focused on
adolescent behavior with digital information. As indicated above, the focus will be on
active information-seeking behavior, although other stages may be discussed as they
relate to this stage.
To better frame the studies on this subject, the following subsection will first
discuss findings on two phases of youth information seeking: interactions with the
Internet search result page and decisions on when to end a search (i.e. which website
24

is chosen to use). After this, the various challenges youth may face in accessing
digital information are reviewed.
INTERACTIONS WITH SEARCH RESULTS AND PREFERENCES FOR WEBSITES
After retrieving a list of websites from the search engine, youth exhibit several timesaving techniques in choosing which site to use, most notably that of “satisficing,” or
choosing an adequate result as opposed to the best choice (Agosto, 2002a), as well as
frequently choosing the first entry on the search result list (Druin, at al., 2009; Foss,
et al., 2013). In their extensive review of the literature, Gasser, Cortesi, Malik, & Lee
(2012) found that “according to multiple studies, the termination of the search process
depends not only on the finding of satisfactory information, but also on factors such
as motivation, boredom, time limit, and information overload” (p. 9). (This “stopping
behavior” is described more extensively, though with adults, in Browne, Pitts, and
Wetherbe, 2007).
Young people also tend to use the words in the titles of the results as clues
(Hirsh, 1999; Subramaniam et al., 2015b), follow keywords without context
(Madden, Ford, Miller, & Levy, 2006), and choose sites based on previous usage
(Vanderschantz, Hinze, & Cunningham, 2014). Other studies find that youth engage
in “fortuitous searching,” chaining their searches from link to link (Horst, HerrStephenson, & Robinson, 2010, p. 54 as cited in Gasser, Cortesi, Malik, & Lee,
2012). Vanderschantz, Hinze, and Cunningham (2014) more recently conducted a
study with 9-11 year olds from which they modeled children’s computer search
behavior. Through semi-structured interviews with these children, the authors
identified that the 22 youth followed a four-part process in their searches. The first
25

part involved a Google search. The participants’ choices of search results were based
on five characteristics: 1) its ranking in the list (they chose the first result), 2) the
description of the site, 3) the words in the title, 4) their knowledge of a site, or 5) the
fact that it was Wikipedia.
Once students choose a site from the search result list, they use several
methods of deciding whether it is appropriate for their use. Youth typically place
emphasis on the aesthetics of sites (Agosto, 2002a, 2002b; Fergie et al., 2013; Fidel et
al., 1999; Gasser et al., 2012; Sundar, 2008). They also tend to favor websites with a
large amount of information (Agosto, 2002b; Hirsh, 1999), but shy away from
predominantly text-based sites (Bilal, 2004; Kafai & Bates, 1997).
Research is mixed on whether youth display appropriate wariness in terms of
the validity of web information sources. Studies from the early 2000s (Borzekowski
& Rickert, 2001; Hanson et al., 2003) find that youth either do not consider
credibility when using the Internet or think that it is largely reliable, but recent
research (Fisher, Marcoux, Meyers, & Landry, 2007; Fergie et al., 2013) show that
this may be changing. That said, the various preferences of youth for websites with
graphics or great quantities of information do not necessarily suggest credibility is a
major influence. Indeed in recent studies with middle-schoolers, researchers found
that the youths struggled with making credibility judgments and frequently relied
primarily on what they previously believed was true (St. Jean et al., 2015;
Subramaniam et al., 2015b).

26

CHALLENGES
The above focuses on youth information-seeking behavior and preferences. This
section focuses on challenges the literature has identified that youth frequently have
in accessing online information (that in some cases may explain the behavior above).
In this study, access is defined using the tripartite access model (Burnett, Jaeger, &
Thompson, 2008), in which physical, intellectual, and social access are all necessary
to meet information needs.
P HYSICAL A CCESS

Physical access, “generally viewed as access to the document or other form
embodying information, be it conveyed through print, electronic, verbal, or another
means of communication” (Thompson, Jaeger, Taylor, Subramaniam, & Bertot, 2014,
p. 4), is a necessary prerequisite to answering an information need. Unfortunately,
even in an age when young people are deemed “digital natives” (Prensky, 2001),
some youth (particularly those from lower socio-economic backgrounds) lack regular
access to Internet-enabled devices (Lenhart, 2012) and some may experience a lack of
access to appropriate information sources (Lenhart, 2010). This is compounded by the
reduction of public spaces, such as school and public libraries, for youth to access the
necessary hardware to get online (American Library Association, 2014). Although
many youth have smartphone devices (and indeed these are frequently their only form
of Internet access) (Madden, Lenhart, Duggan, Cortesi, & Gasser, 2013), the way that
information is perceived over a mobile phone is markedly different from that of a
computer, in terms of screen and keyboard size as well as available data.
27

The lack of physical access has important implications for young people’s
digital literacy skills (Subramaniam et al., 2015b). Exposure to computers in
everyday life is identified as an important aspect of information access (Subramaniam
et al., 2015a) and health literacy (Kerka, 2003; Norman & Skinner, 2006a; Wilson,
2001) for a reason. Differing degrees of access may contribute to a participation gap,
in which the types of interactions youth have with the Internet differ based on their
access to computers (Hargittai & Hinnant, 2008; Jenkins, 2009).
I NTELLECTUAL A CCESS

Intellectual access, “revolves around the ability to understand how to get to and, in
particular, how to understand the information itself once it has been physically
obtained” (Thompson et al., 2014, p. 5). Information literacy, defined by Eisenberg
(2008) as “the set of skills and knowledge that allows us to find, evaluate, and use the
information we need, as well as to filter out the information we don’t need” (p. 39).
Subramaniam et al. (2015a) have identified a collection of “literacy bits” necessary to
successfully meet health information needs. Among the “bits” related to the search
stage are: limiting “reliance on surface characteristics, such as the design of a
Website, the language used, etc. (surface credibility),” reducing “search result
selection based solely on word familiarity,” understanding “how search engines work
(i.e., hits, order of search results, snippets, inclusion/placement of ads, etc.),” and
using appropriate keywords and spelling in searches, among others.
Reading, writing, and comprehension are at the cornerstone of information
literacy. The vast majority of health literacy definitions also include basic literacy
28

(reading and comprehension skills) as a necessary skill (AMA, 2014; AMA Ad hoc
Committee on Health Literacy for the Council on Scientific Affairs, 1999; Baker,
2006; Bernhardt, Brownfield, & Parker, 2005; IOM, 2004; Kerka, 2003; Mancuso,
2008; NHES, 2013; Norman & Skinner, 2006; Nutbeam, 2008; Ormshaw, Paakkari,
& Kannas, 2013; Schillenger, 2001; Skopelja, Whipple, & Richwine, 2008; Squiers,
Peinado, Berkman, Boudewyns, & McCormack, 2012; Sørensen, Van den Broucke,
Fullam, Doyle, Pelikan, Slonska, & Brand, 2012; von Wagner, Steptoe, Wolf, &
Wardle, 2008; Wilson, 2001; Zarcadoolas, Pleasant, & Greer, 2005; see also
Subramaniam et al., 2015a). Websites, particularly health and science websites, have
been found to be written at higher reading levels than are appropriate for young
adolescents (Large & Beheshti, 2000; Ng and Gunstone, 2002) and misspellings and
generic word choices have been found to impede search (Bilal, 2001; Fidel, 1999;
Hanson, Derry, Resnick, & Richardson, 2003).
The term “digital native,” meaning the generation of youth who have grown
up among technology, is commonly used to demonstrate the expertise young people
have with digital media. There is, however, a danger in assuming youth have
intellectual skills that can successfully work with all kinds of technology. Studies
have shown that youth are in fact not expert searchers (Centre for Information
Behaviour and the Evaluation of Research [CIBER], 2008), and that their teachers
frequently have more knowledge of certain kinds of technology uses than their
students (Wang, Hsu, Campbell, Coster, & Longhurst, 2014). In fact, a variety of
studies have found that youths’ search skills frequently impair their ability to meet
their information needs (Gray et al., 2005; Skopelja, Whipple, & Richwine, 2008) As
29

Eastin (2008) puts it, “When it comes to ‘digital natives,’ nothing should be taken for
granted – the digital environment is a complex, changing entity with which children
of all ages struggle when searching for and evaluating information” (p. 43).
S OCIAL A CCESS

Social access “captures the idea that simply because one can physically and
intellectually access needed information, it does not necessarily follow that one does
access that information or that all readers, listeners, or touchers interpret the
information in the same way” (Thompson et al., 2014, p. 6). This particular brand of
access (and associated challenges) directly relates to the question of whether personal
perceptions of various institutions affect a searcher’s decision from where and
whether to access information. Although probably the least studied area of access,
and even less studied with youth, Gasser et al. (2012) report studies that show
demographics may affect youth search behavior, such as the topics for which to
search. They cite the findings of Jackson et al. (2008), in which African American
females were most likely to search for information on depression, mood, and mental
illness and about health, diet, and fitness. Gender also was a factor in differing search
behaviors. Culture is mentioned as a possible factor for the findings of Boyar, Levine,
and Zensius (2011), in which female youth of color seek out sexual health
information on the web because of the pressure of authority figures not to engage in
sexual activities (Gasser, 2012, p. 52).

YOUTH PERCEPTIONS OF GOVERNMENT
This study seeks young people’s perceptions of government in order to gauge their
overall feelings, attitudes and beliefs toward government, as well as their definition of
government. Because this is an exploratory study, what the participants might
consider when describing their perceptions was unknown. The following looks at two
main areas of research:
1. Research explaining inputs that may influence young people’s perceptions,
including political socialization and, specifically, the influences of the media,
major world events, and civic education on people’s ideologies; and
2. Research on trust evaluations of government, including those of youth.
YOUTH AND POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION
Scholars find that young people show signs of having a distinct political identity
(Sapiro, 2004). Surveys of older youth (aged 18-29) show that these young people’s
political leanings directly affect their trust in political officials, for example. In terms
of President Obama in 2014, 53% of Democrats, 23% of Independents, and only 13%
of Republicans trusted the President to do the right thing all or most of the time
(Institute of Politics, 2014). This of course says little about younger youth, but it does
suggest that the adolescent years (and those before) include developing political
beliefs and attitudes. These issues of socialization situate the issue of early
perceptions of government institutions in a place of importance because they affect “a
young person’s developing identity for political participation, for a sense of civic

31

responsibility, and for a sense of political efficacy” (Torney-Purta, Barber, &
Richardson, 2004, p. 16).
Much of the scholarship related to government and younger adolescents and
children focuses on political socialization. Flanagan & Sherrod (1998) highlight the
differences between early research on political socialization, in which young children,
assumed to be passive, were the focus of study and authority figures were expected to
be their biggest influences versus the research of later years, in which adolescents and
young adults were believed to be more active participants in their political
development. Recent research tends to unite the two views with new knowledge of
developmental patterns and plasticity of beliefs throughout life. Influences believed to
have some effect on young people’s later political beliefs include parents, peers, the
media, level of education, involvement in organized activities as youth, civic
education, and major world events that occur during their formative years (Crystal &
DeBell, 2002; Damico, Conway, and Damico, 2000; Flanagan & Sherrod, 1998;
McLeod, 2000; Niemi & Junn; Twenge, Campbell, & Carter, 2014; Wray-Lake &
Hart, 2012). Particularly salient to this study are the possible effects of the media and
major world events on young people’s ideologies.
Adolescents spend a lot of time around media. A 2010 study by the Kaiser
Family Foundation found that young people aged eight to 18 spend on average seven
hours and 38 minutes per day using media; when multi-tasking is taken into account,
exposure increases almost two hours. In other words, youth are exposed to 10 hours
and 45 minutes of media per day (within seven and ahalf hours of use). The study
notes particularly high rates of use amongst 11- to 14- year-olds and Black and
32

Hispanics; “Eleven- to fourteen-year-olds average just under nine hours of media use
a day (8:40), and when multitasking is taken into account, pack in nearly 12 hours of
media exposure (11:53)...Hispanic and Black youth average about 13 hours of media
exposure daily (13:00 for Hispanics and 12:59 for Blacks), compared to just over 8½
hours (8:36) among Whites” (p. 5).
These numbers are compelling for many reasons, but particularly notable for
this study is the relationship of media use and political socialization. Studies find that
media has a profound impact on young people, particularly with regards to health
behaviors like aggression and use of tobacco and alcohol (Brown & Bobkowksi,
2011). Additionally, scholars note that both the choice of media type and the
consumption of media affect young people’s general socialization; as Arnett (1995)
explains “When they seek entertainment or high sensation from media, when they use
media materials toward identity formation or for coping, when they participate in a
media based youth subculture, adolescents are also in a larger sense, participating in
activities that are part of their socialization” (p. 525). In adults, use of TV news has
been connected to political polarization (Hmielowski, Beam, & Hutchens, 2015) and
trust in government has been linked to the overall positivity or negativity of the press
(Hetherington, 1998). Perhaps more notably, a number of studies have recently linked
media use to higher levels of civic engagement (Bakker & de Vreese, 2011) and
political knowledge (Pasek, Kenski, Romer, & Jamieson, 2006). Overall, the type,
frequency, and attitudes of media influence young people’s socialization.
Political socialization also depends on the societal climate in which a person
develops. In their study of the socialization effects of political campaigns, Sears and
33

Valentino (1997) assert that “most socializing communications, and the greatest
socialization gains, are likely to be triggered by the intervention of exogenous
political events” (p. 46). This carries with it the implication that while socialization
may be related to a life stage, connections are based more on events that occur during
a periof of time in a generation’s youth than the general developmental characteristics
that all generations possess, an example of which, the authors cite, are the trusting
attitudes that children tended to have under Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy
compared to the less favorable attitudes developed under Presidents Johnson and
Nixon (p. 46). Jennings, Stoker, and Bowers (1999) found that although parent-child
transmission of political views are generally predictably strong, during periods of
societal change, such as the 1960s, politicized households more frequently produced
children who disagreed with parental views. While this data do not necessarily reflect
the current state of society, they do suggest that when society goes through periods of
change (such as after significant cultural events), normal political socialization
processes can be altered.
TRUST IN GOVERNMENT
Scholarly literature on trust as it relates to civic institutions and government officials
is an oft-studied concept in such fields as political science and political
communication (see, for example, Levi & Stoker, 2000 for an extensive treatment on
the subject). Despite this depth of research, studies on young people’s trust in
government are rare. Thus, in the following discussion of conceptualizations of trust
and distrust, most of the research has been on adults. At the conclusion of this section,
the few studies that have looked at youth specifically will be highlighted.
34

The following components of trust, outlined by Levi & Stoker (2000) are
implicit factors in the discussion about trust that occur in this study:
•

“Trust is relational; it involves an individual making herself vulnerable to
another individual, group, or institution that has the capacity to do her harm or
to betray her.

•

Trust is seldom unconditional; it is given to specific individuals or institutions
over specific domains…

•

Trust is a judgment that can be conceptualized dichotomously (one either
trusts or distrusts) or in a more graded fashion (one trusts or distrusts to a
degree)…

•

Trust judgments are expected to inspire courses of action…

•

The trust judgment reflects beliefs about the trustworthiness of the other
person (or group or institution)” (p. 476).

This definition speaks to the impact that trust has on people’s lives and the power
dynamic between a person giving trust and the institution or person to which the trust
is given.
Trust in government specifically is a difficult concept to encapsulate, largely
because of the vast array of definitions and conceptualizations that can be found in
the literature. The following definitions of trust in government, however, are
particularly relevant to this study. Cooke & Gronke (2005) describe trust as being
defined as either a deeply engrained moral issue (Uslaner, 2002) or as more closely
related to whims of current topics (Hardin, 2002). Thomas (1998) posits that trust in
35

government develops from personal expectations (associated with demographic
characteristics), reciprocal agreements, and institutional standards or laws and
regulations. He also conceives of three distinct types of trust – fiduciary (made up of
unbalanced relations), mutual (promoted by interaction with the other person or
body), and social (associated with established institutions) (p. 170). Trust is also
differentiated by degrees, from low to high. In addition, Cooke and Gronke (2005)
suggest another measure in which citizens actively distrust government. They suggest
that a low degree of trust reflects skepticism, while actual distrust reflects cynicism.
Trust in government can also be conceived as trust in the system or regime
(diffuse support) or trust in certain government officials (specific support) (Easton,
1965). A clear sign of the tension between these two conceptualizations are the results
of the National Election Studies (NES) over the past few decades. The survey that
makes up the NES contains questions designed to “tap the basic evaluative
orientations towards the national government,” which became known as trust-ingovernment questions (Stokes, 1962, p. 64 in Levi & Stoker, 2000, p. 477). Levi and
Stoker (2000) have summarized research on the studies done since the survey’s
inception, and explain that “Evidence from all sorts of studies…found the NES
responses to have strong partisan and incumbent-specific components…Trust
judgments are also influenced by evaluations of the performance of the incumbent
president or government, particularly in the economic realm; by evaluations of the
leaders’ personal qualities; and by dissatisfaction with the policies being promoted or
implemented by the current government” (p. 480). That said, they also note that
declining trust since the 1970s has not been altered by changing parties in power or
36

major events, suggesting deeper roots of lagging trust. Regardless, they suggest that
political ideologies have more effect on trust than personality or social characteristics.
Ultimately, trust in government is evaluated using many different metrics.
Hetherington (1998) suggests that trust in government should be considered on
multiple levels, including evaluations of specific institutions (e.g. Congress), of the
President, of policies being considered, and of policy outcomes, as well as the types
of information people get through the media and cultural change. Others use such
metrics as the degree of ethics demonstrated by a government (OECD, 2000) and the
degree of confidence one has in government’s ability to get things done (i.e.
performance) (Carter & Bélanger, 2005). Even with all of these considerations,
however, at the root of each argument is the belief that a person’s level of trust in
institutions (or government, officials, people, etc.) has some effect on his or her
behavior.
YOUTH TRUST IN GOVERNMENT
These different ways of defining, measuring, and applying trust have been generally
developed with adults. However, Damico, Conway, and Damico’s (2000) study found
that the most important influence of adult trust was past trust. The results thus
indicate that the context and experiences of early life and adolescence play a role in
predicting later trust. This link is a reminder of the importance of social trust. As
Kelly (2009) states “the very nature of social trust—trust in individuals and trust in
government and social institutions—promotes the likelihood for individuals to
actively engage in society through service, voting, and other forms of selfgovernance, such as political activism,” citing such studies as Glaeser, Laibson,
37

Scheinkman, and Soutter (2000), Kwak et al. (2004), Newton (2001), Newton and
Pippa (2000), and Torney-Purta, Richardson, and Barber (2004) as further proof.
Recently, there has been an influx of research on young people’s declining
trust in institutions, though the majority of this has been done with youth aged 18 and
over. Levitsky (2014) writes of a speech by Amanda Lenhart, a researcher at Pew
Research Center, at which Lenhart painted a picture of a generation wary of
government, but accepting of corporations. She cites data from Pew to show that
“nearly half of adults aged 18 to 29 think that it is a fair trade for corporations to
gather their personal information in exchange for a free service,” while “nearly 6 in
10…think that Snowden’s revelations served the public interest,” displaying a keen
dislike of government secrecy.” The Harvard Institute of Politics (2015) finds that
nearly half of 18-29 year-olds polled do not have confidence that the justice system is
fair and report continuing low levels of trust in government institutions, including the
military, the Supreme Court, the President, the United Nations, the Federal
Government, and Congress, though they do report that these levels are at least higher
than the previous year’s record lows (p. 8; 12).

E-GOVERNMENT
HISTORICAL GOALS
In its earliest inception, one of the key goals of e-government was to connect
government to citizens directly (government-to-citizen or “G2C”), facilitating
engagement and increasing access (P.L. 107–347). Several critiques of this optimistic
vision soon emerged, however, including questions of usability and access (Belanger
38

& Carter, 2009; Bertot & Jaeger, 2006; Bertot, Jaeger, Langa, & McClure, 2006;
Jaeger, 2006). Jaeger (2005) also suggests that e-government can be (and has been)
used to further the agendas of those in power, for example, through biased web
content or purposeful limitations to access. Indeed, he points out that the
objectiveness of information on government sites that many people expect (Anderson,
2002) is in fact often a myth, with most information representing the beliefs of the
party in power or the mission of the website’s creator agency (see also Chadwick,
2001; Davis, 1999)
Issues of access, too, have been largely ignored by the federal government,
with most either indirectly or directly sending citizens to intermediaries (like the
public library) for help (Bertot, Jaeger, Langa, & McClure, 2006; Taylor, Gorham,
Lincoln, Jaeger, Bertot, & Larson, 2014). In one early study, a searcher’s level of
education correlated with his or her belief that government websites were reliable
(Welch & Hinnant, 2003). The study’s authors posit that this could mean that more
educated users can better differentiate reliable and unreliable sites, but it might also
suggest that there are barriers to access for less educated users. Jaeger and Thompson
(2004) also suggest that the information poor may be especially cut off from the
benefits of e-government, whether it is because of lack of awareness, belief that it
lacks relevance to their lives, lack of trust in e-government, and/or design decisions
that impede access to those who lack basic or digital literacy or those who have
physical or mental disabilities that prevent them from reaching the information.
That said, as of 2007, Rainie, Estabrook, & Witt found that over three-fourths
(78%) of Internet users had visited government websites, with 38% searching official
39

government documents or statistics, 24% seeking information about health or safety
problems from a government agency, and 22% looking or applying for government
benefits (p. 6). They also found that 70% of Americans have an expectation of finding
government agency information online (p. 6). Given that these data are nearly a
decade old now, it is likely that expectations have only increased.
Even with the fledgling governmental presence on social media, however,
issues like “privacy, security, accuracy and archiving” have hindered the growth of egovernment (Bertot, Jaeger, & Hansen, 2012, p. 32). Indeed there still seems some
truth to the early hypothesis that the one-way pattern of information dissemination
without accompanying interactivity could actually reduce the connection between the
government and its citizens (Bovens & Stavros, 2002). Of course, even the one-way
dissemination can be threatened by external political events. During the government
shut-down of Fall 2013, several agencies blacked out their websites as there were no
employees available to monitor or update them (Shuler, Jaeger, & Bertot, 2014). In
June 2015, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management was hacked, possibly by the
Chinese government, leading to compromised personal data of anywhere from four
point two million to 18 million current, former, and prospective government
employees (Perez & Prokupecz, 2015). These issues lead to questions of reliability
and emphasize e-government’s place in the turbulent national and international
political landscape.
E-GOVERNMENT AND TRUST
For the most part scholarship connecting e-government and trust looks at how the
trust of government influences use and not vice versa. For example, Carter and
40

Belanger (2005) found that when trustworthiness was conceived as trust of the
Internet and trust of state government, there was a positive relationship between level
of trust and intention to use a state e-government service (p. 18). Sharoni’s 2012
study links social media use, online interactions with government, and online political
activity with efficacy and trust.
Two studies that have looked at how the use of e-government affects attitude
found that, while use of e-government may increase feelings of confidence in how
well government is solving problems (West, 2004) and influence “perceptions of
transparency of government, accessibility of government information, and increased
responsiveness of the federal government” (Tolbert & Mossberger, 2006, p. 365),
trust was not affected by use. Parent, Vandebeek, and Gemino (2005) posit that
“internal political efficacy is indicative of the power a citizen feels they have over
government after the election has taken place…this construct, more so than the
overall perceived quality of the Web site, significantly influences and explains the
citizen’s overall trust in government, and ensuing belief that the government will be
responsive” (p.731). Other studies have found that trust is increased when users find
an e-government site high-quality (Chee-Week, Bensabat, & Cenfetelli, 2008) and
when the outcome of the use of e-government is successful (Smith, 2010; Welsh,
Hinnant, & Jae Moon, 2005).
YOUTH AND E-GOVERNMENT
As mentioned in the introduction, there is very little scholarly information on egovernment for youth. Venturing into agency memoranda and policy decisions about
e-government for youth yields slightly more information, but these data do not reveal
41

anything about youth opinions and interactions with government websites. Beginning
with President Clinton’s memorandum to agency officials in 1997, which called for
the development of resources for children, youth have been at least acknowledged on
government sites. Resources are most frequently directed either at teachers or
developed for use in education. A working group formed by over thirty agencies soon
after President Clinton’s memo was sent began work on what would become the
Federal Resources for Educational Excellence (FREE) website, which grants public
access to federally supported education resources (Department of Education, 2001).
The Department of Education also formed “Consortium for Education Teams,” which
brought together over 300 educators between 1998 and 2000 to form 10 teams
representing five agencies intended to develop learning activities, lessons, and units
(Department of Education, 2001).
In the following years, the government has unveiled “kids.gov,” a portal for
young people to discover various trustworthy websites on topics believed to be of
interest to them. Agencies have also continued to develop resources for youth, though
the degree to which they are successful in this depends largely on the budget and
focus of the agency. Perhaps the most salient point of interest for this study is the
recent announcement by the White House in its 5-year STEM (science, technology,
engineering, and math) strategic plan of the consolidation of many agency STEM
programs (Committee on STEM Education National Science and Technology
Council, 2013). In this plan, the Committee calls for the Smithsonian “to work with
NSF, ED, the other CoSTEM agencies…to harness their unique expertise and
resources to disseminate relevant, evidence-based materials and curricula, on-line
42

resources, and delivery and dissemination mechanisms to reach more teachers and
students both inside and outside the classroom” (n.p.) [Emphasis mine].
This was followed by the closure of the Office of Science Education in the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) (the producer of the youth-focused website
LifeWorks, an online compendium of health careers). The principal deputy director of
the NIH, Lawrence Tabak defended the closure, saying “[K-12] education has never
been part of [the agency’s] formal mandate…And frankly, it has never been a very
high priority for NIH” (Mervis, 2013b). The website accompanying “Best Bones
Forever,” a public health campaign run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services’s Office of Women’s Health was also recently put up for bidders to take
over its trademark and the site (Prospective Grant of Exclusive Trademark, 2014).
These moves seem to anticipate the White House’s proposed consolidation, which
was followed by skepticism from members of Congress (Mervis, 2013a). What
impact all of this has on the e-government presence of affected agencies remains to be
seen, but considering one of the hardest hit agencies would be NASA, an agency with
a robust web presence directed at youth, the landscape of STEM education-related egovernment may change significantly.

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
This amalgamation of research has led to the design of this dissertation, including the
choice to focus on the contexts and antecedents of information behavior and questions
specifically about attitudes and beliefs of searchers.

43

INFLUENCE OF INFORMATION BEHAVIOR RESEARCH
Because of the context in which I am studying these participants (i.e. the HackHealth
after-school program) and the questions asked in data instruments (see chapter three),
active search is the focus of both this review and this dissertation. For example,
participants are focusing on finding information on a specific topic throughout the
program (thus their searches have purpose) and the questions asked are in the vein of,
“if you were searching for health information,” which again describes an active
process. It is also assumed that attitudes, contexts, and prior experience all interact to
influence these actions and that youth construct the knowledge they find through their
information search. The models discussed are also a mix of theories on ELIS and on
work-related and imposed-query searches. Again, both have been used to understand
the path to fulfilling information needs because of the hybrid design of this study. In
addition, from prior studies conducted with youth, there are certain expectations one
may have on how youth conduct searches, including satisficing, basing evaluations on
website aesthetics and prior use, and demonstrating a tendency to choose the first site
on the list of results. These behaviors also are influenced by several common barriers
to access, including challenges related to a lack of experience with (and access to)
computers, intellectual challenges, such as low levels of digital, information, basic,
and health literacy, and social challenges, such as pre-existing opinions of authority
and what makes a qualified source. Finally, prior research on credibility assessments
of online information gives insight into what factors a participant might cite as
reasons to use or not use a government website.

44

INFLUENCE OF YOUTH, GOVERNMENT, AND E-GOVERNMENT RESEARCH
The studies on trust in government demonstrate that the concept of trust is multilayered. Thus this study draws from the multiplicity of origins for trust discussed
above (e.g. confidence in government institutions, whims of current events, and
political efficacy, among others). When coding and analyzing the statements youth
make about their own levels of trust, these various theories all will be considered.
The origins of e-government, particularly the goal to increase citizen
engagement, are important underlying considerations of the need for youth to be able
to access government websites. Barriers to access limit these outcomes. The
discussion of youth-focused e-government demonstrates the varied levels of attention
the federal government has given to youth as an audience, which may factor into
recommendations made from the findings of this study. Finally, the connections
between trust in government and e-government are, while tenuous, significant enough
to give credence to the idea that youths’ opinions of government may in fact affect
their use of e-government (or vice versa).
SUMMARY OF C ONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Drawing together the literature discussed above, this study is grounded in four
propositions. Additional constructs that emerge during analysis will be incorporated
into this framework.
1. Access is conceived as physical, intellectual and social (Burnett, Jaeger, &
Thompson, 2008). Each of these levels can create barriers to information
seeking and the fulfillment of information needs;

45

2. Demographics, experiences, and beliefs influence information-seeking
behavior (Johnson, Andrews, & Allard, 2001);
3. An increase in confidence in the government after use of e-government has
been demonstrated, though not with youth (Chee-Week, Bensabat, &
Cenfetelli, 2008; Smith, 2010; Welsh, Hinnant, & Jae Moon, 2005). Thus,
experiences with e-government may affect a user’s perception of government;
and
4. E-government is intended to promote democracy and access to government,
thus any barriers to access should be identified and addressed.
Data collection instruments assume an information need and focus on hypothetical
choices of using government websites to fulfill this need, as well as the chances of the
information seeker finding the government website. Evaluations of both hypothetical
and real government websites are both investigated. These choices and evaluations
are based on a participant’s age, experiences, and prior beliefs. Intellectual, physical,
and social access also affect the choice and evaluation. These influences lead to
perceptions of government and government websites, which themselves may be
connected. Perceptions of government and government websites feed back into the
information-seeking behavior. Figure 2.4 shows these propositions graphically within
the context of this study.

CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY
This chapter describes the methodology for the study, including the main problem
and research questions, followed by a discussion of the methodological framework
used. The qualitative paradigm and methodological traditions which grounded the
study, as well as the researcher’s role in the study are also discussed. Next, the
research design used in the study is presented, including information on participant
recruitment, participant demographics, data collection instruments, and the methods
of data analysis. Following the discussion of the research design, means of
verification and ethical considerations are described.

OVERVIEW
PROBLEM S TATEMENT, OBJECTIVES, AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Although e-government is a widely studied area, little research has been done on the
way that young people understand and interact with digital government information.
In addition, even in the robust field of information behavior, the possibility that
young people’s perceptions of institutions have an impact on their perceptions of
information has been little explored. Thus, there were two main goals for this
research: 1) To develop an understanding of the perceptions these young people have
of government and e-government and 2) to observe connections between perceptions
of government and perceptions of e-government. The following questions guided
both the design of the study and the analysis of the data:
1. What are HackHealth participants’ perceptions of government?
49

2. What are HackHealth participants’ perceptions of e-government?
From these two questions, potential relationships and connections between the two
perceptions could be examined.
These research questions were explored through a qualitative study of middleschool youth in four schools in a Maryland school district. Participants were attendees
of the after-school program HackHealth, which met for an hour and a half to two
hours, once-per-week, for 10-12 weeks at each school in Winter 2014 and Spring
2015. This dissertation represents research questions, data collection, and data
analysis that were formulated distinctly from research already taking place in
HackHealth, but the data gathered is situated within the context of this after-school
program focused on health literacy.
THE QUALITATIVE PARADIGM
This dissertation is grounded in the qualitative paradigm. Ontologically, reality is
defined as subjective, which allows for multiple viewpoints of the participants.
Ultimately, the purpose of the research is to understand how participants perceive
government and government websites and the connections between these perceptions.
The paradigmatic approach of this study is a mix of constructivism and pragmatism.
Constructivism, a worldview in which “individuals seek understanding of the world
in which they live and work,” leading the researcher to “make sense of…the
meanings others have about the world” (Creswell, 2007, p. 20-21), follows from the
information behavior theories chosen to guide this research (e.g. Sense-making).
Ultimately, however, the various data collection instruments were chosen to best
produce a productive outcome of the research, or, in other words, to focus on “the
50

actions, situations, and consequences of inquiry” (Creswell, 2007, p. 22). This
pragmatist view supports the goals of the research, which are to understand the
perceptions and levels of trust of government and e-government of a select group of
young people, to explore whether there are relationships between these perceptions,
and to contribute to both research and practice. The findings of the research inform
both the development of e-government resources (both those targeted to youth and
those designed for a wider audience) and how educators teach youth about the
selection of trustworthy and useful resources.
This dissertation is an exploratory case study, distinguished as such by its
intent to “investigat[e] a contemporary phenomenon in depth and within its real-life
context” (Yin, 2009, p.18). Following methodological tradition, the study “relies on
multiple sources of evidence, with data needing to converge in a triangulating
fashion...[and] benefits from the prior development of theoretical propositions to
guide data collection and analysis” (Yin, 2009, p. 18). It is bounded in time (10-12
weeks for each school), place (mid-Atlantic, U.S. middle school libraries participating
in the HackHealth program), and participant group (youth participating in
HackHealth at each school), all hallmark characteristics of case study methodology.
More specifically, this is an embedded case study that draws on theories of
youth information behavior, political socialization, and trust in government. The
study includes several units of analysis, including different tasks across students (see
data collection tools below) and individual students studied across tasks.
Within this case study, the data collection instruments have been designed to
produce multiple sources of evidence, including interviews and participant51

observation, among others. Yin (2009) describes the use of multiple sources of data
as “a major strength of case study data collection” and notes this type of triangulation
as essential to the case study methodology; “...the need to use multiple sources of
evidence far exceeds that in other research methods” (pp. 114-115).
THE RESEARCHER ’S ROLE
The researcher’s role in this study follows epistemological qualitative tradition in that
the aim is to “minimize the distance” between the researcher and the participants
(Creswell, 2007, p.18, citing Guba & Lincoln, 1988, p. 94). In the HackHealth afterschool program, I studied participants, but I also served as an instructor, leading
sessions of the program, designing lesson plans, and assisting students with their
work. This of course means that the results of the study reflect my interpretations of
events, as well as my relationship with each participant.
Additionally, several elements of the study were designed with the goal of
eliciting information on participants’ perceptions of government to identify possible
links to the use and perception of e-government (and vice versa). The assumption that
these links may exist is based on prior work (Subramaniam et al., 2015b) and
informal interactions with participants. That said, this pre-existing assumption could
have potentially led to the identification of connections that do not actually exist, a
possible limitation discussed further in chapter seven. Although data collection
methods were designed to triangulate findings and validate analyses with other
researchers, the axiological approach of this study also accepts these potential biases
(Creswell, 2007). Indeed this approach assumes that all studies include a positioning

52

of oneself in results and analysis, and that no study can ever be free of value
judgments.

RESEARCH DESIGN
PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT
The HackHealth program in 2014-2015 was run in four middle schools. The choice of
the participating schools for the 2014-2015 program year were based on one of two
criteria: 1) that the school librarian was involved in the first HackHealth program year
(2013-2014) or 2) that the school librarian was recommended by the school district’s
supervisor of library media services. Both sets of school librarians received a
monetary honorarium for their service ($1500 for the new librarians; $3500 for
returning librarians). Participants were recruited for the after-school program by the
school librarian in their respective schools. The librarians distributed an informational
flyer (designed by the HackHealth research team) to interested students and parents
(see Appendix One). The students also received two consent forms – one for their
own assent and one for their parents to review and sign. Both consent forms were
collected at an introductory session of the program, during which researchers and/or
the librarians explained the program in more detail and carried out preliminary data
collection.
Any students attending the participating schools were eligible to participate,
as long as they had their parent’s permission and a ride home after the session. When
possible, the after-school sessions were held on days that the school had an activity

53

bus to maximize participation. As a benefit for the participants’ and their parents’
participation, they were given $50 at the conclusion of the program.

PARTICIPANTS ’ C IVIC ATTITUDES
To provide context for their perceptions of government, three questions in the survey
(described later in this chapter) were designed to measure participants’ beliefs in the
general fairness and equality of life in America, as well as their trust of people in
general. Table 3.3 shows both these questions and the number of participants who
disagreed, agreed, or felt uncertain about the question. The overall average for each
answer is displayed in the bottom row.

Answer
Overall, the answer averages for the first two questions (people get fair treatment and
people in America have an equal chance) fell around three – neither agree nor
disagree. About half of respondents, however, did agree or disagree. Forty percent (13
out of 32) disagreed or strongly disagreed that people get fair treatment in America,
no matter who they are. One-fourth disagreed or strongly disagreed that in America

you have an equal chance no matter where you come from or what race you are. The
third question was particularly resonant. The average answer was solidly disagree;
overall, half of participants (16 out of 32) disagreed that most people can be trusted.
PARTICIPANT PSEUDONYMS
The pseudonyms used to protect the participants’ privacy throughout this dissertation
were chosen by the participants. Pseudonyms and initials are used interchangeably; a
complete list of names and pseudonyms is included in Table 3.4. Additionally,
throughout this document, the participant’s school’s letter designation (i.e. AA, BB,
CC, and DD) will be included after the participant’s name or initial along with a
designation of the instrument from which the data mentioned was pulled (i.e.

DATA COLLECTION
Data were collected in each of the four schools over the course of their respective 1012-week programs. The informal learning environment of the after-school program
contributed to the more authentic representation of the participants’ selves, even
though more formal instruction and data collection activities occurred. In Table 3.5
below, an overview of the data instruments used are listed. The mix of data collection
instruments was critical to this study. In their discussion of their own study’s mix of
qualitative methods, Darbyshire, Macdougall, and Schiller (2005) note that their “use
of multiple methods increased children’s opportunity to choose and have at least
partial control about how to contribute and what to say, and helped engage and
interest them while demonstrating that [they] recognized them as active agents in the
creation of their worlds” (p. 424). This approach to conducting research with children
58

has also been demonstrated in the information studies field, such as in the work of
Meyers, Fisher, and Marcoux (2009), who used focus groups and interviews; Fisher,
Bishop, Fawcett, and Magasse (2013), who used design-thinking, observation, and
surveys; and Agosto (2002a), who used a mix of web searching sessions and group
interviews.
Many of the data collection tools were part of the larger HackHealth research
study, although certain questions and/or protocols in these tools were developed
specifically for this study. The description column of Table 3.5 describes each tool
generally; longer descriptions of all of the tools follow the table. Table 3.5 also
includes the abbreviation of the instrument that will be used in the following chapters
to show the origin of the quote or reference cited.

S URVEY (S)

The Survey (Appendix Two) focused on demographic information of the participants,
as well as their access to information technology and their use of the Internet. In
addition, for this study, several questions about trust in government were added to the
existing questions used in the HackHealth program. These included open-ended
questions, asking participants to define government and about their knowledge of
60

government websites and agencies, as well as questions on their general trust and
belief in fairness and equality in America. Several of these questions were adapted
from the study “Civic Measurement Models: Tapping Adolescents’ Civic
Engagement” (Flanagin, Syvertsen, & Stout, 2007) and were informed by the
conceptualization of trust in Cook & Gronke (2005), in which level of trust is distinct
from lack of trust. Specifically, the latter affected the phrasing of the question “In
general, elected officials (e.g., senators, members of city council, governor, president)
cannot be trusted,” which was used instead of the phrasing “how much can you
trust…?” These questions were designed to get a general idea of participants’ civic
knowledge as it relates to e-government, as well as to get a snapshot of their belief in
civic life, their own efficacy, and the government in general. Because only the data
from the sections “Background Information,” “Trust in Government,” and “Your
Opinion” were used in this study, these are the sections included in Appendix Two.
H EALTH L ITERACY A SSESSMENT T OOL (HLAT)

The Health Literacy Assessment Tool (Appendix Three) was designed to be a semiobjective measure of the students’ health and information literacy skills. Consisting of
17 questions, the first version of the assessment was delivered at School CC.
Participants were asked to answer questions about the meaning of URLs, credibility
judgments, and other information literacy skills through the use of a story. The
participants were taken through the search process of a fictional young girl, Jasmine,
and by answering the questions listed, they were “helping” Jasmine with her search.

61

After administering this first version of the tool, HackHealth researchers found
that the number of questions needed to be reduced in order to keep the participants’
attention. The second version of the tool was used at schools AA, BB, and DD, and
asked similar, but fewer, questions. Because the use at School CC was used as a pilot,
only data collected from the second version (used at schools AA, BB, and DD) were
used in this dissertation. Additionally, only a selection of the questions was used as a
source of data. These are listed below:
•

Jasmine wants to know which three of these kinds of websites she can trust
the most (circle 3):

.com

.org

.gov

.edu

.net

Explain to Jasmine why you chose these.
•

She went to the website, but Jasmine isn’t sure that she can trust the
information there. How can she decide?

•

Jasmine found two sites about type 1 diabetes, but they don’t have the same
information. How can she tell which one is right?

•

What are three health websites you’d recommend to Jasmine?

I NTERVIEWS (I)

Semi-structured interviews were conducted at each school with one to two
participants at a time. Each researcher in attendance interviewed participants for
approximately 15 minutes during a session early in the after-school program. 5
Interview techniques were informed by guidelines for interviews with children

5

While post-interviews were administered for the HackHealth program, only data from pre-interview
audio and transcripts were used in this dissertation.

62

(Bassett, Beagan, Ristovski-Slijepcevic, & Chapman, 2008; Tammivaara & Enright,
1986). The purpose of the interviews for this study was to probe participants about
their strategies for search and to ask participants about their perceptions of
government and government websites. A list of questions is included in Appendix
Four. Interviews were audio-recorded by each HackHealth researcher and transcribed
by an outside transcriber.
C ARD -S ORTING (CS)

At each of the schools, HackHealth researchers conducted a card-sorting activity with
2-4 participants at a time. The activity was designed to elicit the information sources
that participants would prefer to use to search for health information. There were
three decks – types of people, types of sources, and types of Internet sites – made up
of several individual cards with a particular source printed on the front (e.g. in the
people deck, one card had “teacher” printed on it). Going through one deck at a time,
the HackHealth researcher would ask the particpants which of the cards within the
deck represented the sources they would turn to for health information and which
they would not (e.g. they would ask a doctor, but not a librarian). The participants
were further probed as to whether their preferences would depend on what type of
question was being asked (e.g. personal, school assignment). HackHealth researchers
also inquired as to whether there were any additional sources not included in the
decks. This activity was intended to be an interactive way to understand youth
preferences for health information sources. For this dissertation, the discussions that
occurred during the third deck, types of Internet sources, were particularly useful, as
63

one of the cards offered the choice of government agency websites. The full protocol
(with the list of sources included in each deck) is located in Appendix Five.
W ORD A SSOCIATIONS (WA)

The word association activity was designed to capture participants’ understanding of
government and government websites. More specifically, youth were asked: “What
does the term ‘government’ mean to you? In other words, what words do you
associate with the term ‘government’?” After completing their list for government,
the same question was asked for dot gov websites. The group then discussed their
answers.
C REDIBILITY P OSTER S CREENSHOT A CTIVITY (PS)

The Credibility Poster Screenshot Activity (PS) was designed to better understand the
sections of websites that young people use to assess credibility. The HackHealth
research team identified a range of websites focused on a central theme (Alzheimers
disease). A screenshot from the homepage of each site was captured and then printed
on six different 24’’x 36’’ posters. The posters were laid out on tables or hung on the
wall in the library at each school. Participants were given pink and green post-it notes
to stick on the sections of the homepages they thought made the sites trustworthy
(green post-its) or not trustworthy (pink post-its). They also wrote explanations for
these assessments on the post-it notes and identified the notes with their pseudonyms.
For this study data were only analyzed from the participants’ thoughts on the
homepage of www.alzheimers.gov. Photos of the posters with the participants’
annotations from schools AA, CC, and DD are included in Appendix Six. School BB
64

had a very informal discussion-oriented version of this activity due to low attendance
on the day it was conducted.
P ARTICIPANT O BSERVATION (ON; WAR; RTON)

Participant observation, as summarized by DeWalt and DeWalt (2011), typically
involves: “Living in the context for an extended period of time…actively
participating in a wide range of daily, routine, and extraordinary activities with people
who are full participants in that context…Informally observing during leisure
activities (hanging out); Recording observations in field notes (usually organized
chronologically); [and] Using both tacit and explicit information in analysis and
writing” (p. 5). These techniques were applied to my involvement as a facilitator in
the program, with the obvious caveats that I was a participant with some form of
power over the participants (see more in limitations below) and daily and routine
activities outside of the after-school program were not observed.
Throughout the program, at each school, researchers kept field notes and
wrote observation notes for each session. When quotes or data were used from other
researchers’ notes in the data analysis, they are credited to the researcher in question.
The abbreviation used in-text is RTON (research team observation notes). This
practice of using multiple evaluators is described by Patton (2002) as “investigator
triangulation,” and is one method this study used to corroborate observations.
In addition to these field and observation notes, each session was audiorecorded. Though I was at the majority of the sessions at the four schools, there were
weeks that I did not attend due to travel or illness. Table 3.6 below shows the details
65

of the observations, including my attendance, the number of hours observed at each
school, and whether audio was captured during the weeks I was not present. I listened
to the audio from all sessions that were available and transcribed segments relevant to
this study as part of the data analysis.

PARTICIPANT ATTENDANCE AND COMPLETION OF INSTRUMENTS
Because the data collection for this study was undertaken during a voluntary afterschool program, there was significant variance in the attendance of participants. Table
3.7 shows the number of sessions attended by each participant, as well as the data
collection instruments they completed. Fortunately, the majority of data collection
instruments for this study were administered during the first three weeks at each
school, which were the weeks with the highest number of participants.

6

The weekly sessions at schools AA and BB were one and a half hours long, while the sessions at CC
and DD were 2 hours long.

The number of weeks that sessions were held differed by school due to days that school was closed
for snow. School AA had 11 sessions, School BB had 10 sessions, School CC had 12 sessions, and
School DD had 10 sessions. Attendance data were unavailable for 2 weeks at School BB and School
CC. These weeks have not been included in the total for any of the participants, so the counts for these
participants may be off by two. These were also weeks that audio was not available and I was not
present, so no data were captured for this study during these sessions.

for snow. School AA had 11 sessions, School BB had 10 sessions, School CC had 12 sessions, and
School DD had 10 sessions. Attendance data were unavailable for 2 weeks at School BB and School
CC. These weeks have not been included in the total for any of the participants, so the counts for these
participants may be off by two. These were also weeks that audio was not available and I was not
present, so no data were captured for this study during these sessions.

of text data through the systematic classification process of coding and identifying
themes or patterns” (Hsieh & Shannnon, 2005).
Hsieh and Shannon (2005) identify three main types of content analysis:
conventional, directed, and summative. In conventional content analysis, codes are
defined using the data. In directed, codes are taken in vivo, but also from theory. In
summative, keywords are counted to determine themes. This dissertation uses a
combination of these strategies. Initially, the relevant text to this dissertation was
separated from the data collected for the general HackHealth research study. Relevant
text included references to government, e-government, and potentially influential
“other” categories, such as data relating to digital literacy and physical access. This
follows a strategy used in directed content analysis “to read the transcript and
highlight all text that on first impression appears to represent” the goal of the study”
(Hsieh & Shannon, 2005, p. 1281).
Using this collection of data, the first round of coding was a mix of in vivo
and theory-based coding, or conventional and directed content analysis. For example,
data associated with access were coded into the three types of access identified in the
literature review (physical, intellectual and social), but common topics that came up
in the data, such as security, were categorized in vivo. Summative analysis was also
used; to check for prominent themes, the word frequency function in NVivo was used
to identify common terms and phrases. From the preliminary codes, I created a
second iteration of a codebook by grouping these into categories. With the second
group, I coded interviews from schools DD and checked with a fellow researcher who
had attended the after-school sessions at this school.
70

After these rounds of coding, I identified how the data fit into the research
questions identified for the study. Data were coded as being about e-government or
government. Statements were only coded as relating to government if they were
directly related to government. For example, responses that dot gov sites are more
accurate were only coded under the government code if the participant specifically
stated that this is because they are government-produced. I also coded all data by
participant at this point.
After coding the statements into the government and e-government groups,
direct content analysis was applied. Because there is an extensive literature on the
objects of and inputs on people’s evaluations of trust when considering government,
it made sense to start with these categories and then add to them only if the
participants’ opinions differed. Similarly, with the e-government set of data I used
categories gathered from the literature, including findings on credibility and youth
website preferences.
After focusing on the common reasons for evaluations, I used a process
similar to that used with computers in sentiment analysis, an established analysis
process that describes the identification of “positive and negative opinions, emotions,
and evaluations” (Wilson, Wiebe, & Hoffman, 2005, p. 347). While my analysis was
hand-coded, it still involved filtering out the neutral statements from the polarized
(positive and negative) opinions, just as is done in sentiment analysis. This process
was used to establish each participant’s dominant attitude – did they generally view
government positively or negatively – regardless of the source or reason for their
evaluation. In other words, participants’ perceptions were based on different metrics,
71

inputs, and sources, so this enabled a better understanding of how positive and
negative statements and themes fit into the overall mood of the participants. Table 3.8
below shows examples of positive, negative, and statements deemed “non-polar” or
neutral.

Once participants’ statements were established as positive, negative, or
neutral, the statements demonstrating polarity were counted. A participant with a total
of seven positive statements and two negative statements, for example, would be
designated as having an overall positive perception of government. There were a few
72

participants who either had too little to say about government to measure their
perception (five participants) or had an equal number of statements each way (three
participants). These participants are designated “neutral” (for those with equal
numbers of statements) or “NED” (for those with not enough data). The same process
was applied to the statements about e-government (four participants did not have
enough data and one participant was neutral). Table 3.9 shows examples of positive,
negative, and neutral statements about e-government.

Because there was a large variance in number of sessions attended and data
collection strategies completed, many of the participants had a larger data set from
which to pull. For the purposes of the positive and negative “counts” it is only
relevant in that some participants had more opportunity to give opinions. Table 3.10
shows the total number of positive, neutral, and negative statements for each
participant. Because there were no clear patterns when comparing data from each
school, the tables in the following pages and chapters will be organized alphabetically
by participant.

To establish possible reasons for these attitudes, I returned to the earlier coding on
themes and literature-derived basis of evaluations. The direction of evaluations
informed the findings on participant perceptions, while the themes allowed further
discussion of the findings from the research questions.

VERIFICATION AND VALIDITY
CREDIBILITY
Although the qualitative paradigm does not call for one true answer or complete
objectivity, there are certain standards of credibility this study has strived to meet.
Marshall and Rossman (2011) (referring back to Lincoln and Guba’s (1985) seminal
Naturalistic Inquiry), discuss such measures as prolonged engagement with the study
setting and participants and triangulation of data through “multiple sources, through
multiple methods, and using multiple theoretical lenses” (p. 40). Given the timeframe
of this study (spread over 10-12 weeks at each school) and the multiple types of data
collection strategies used throughout the study, both means of credibility are
addressed.
Another suggestion of Marshall and Rossman (2011) (via Lincoln & Guba) is
to employ “critical friends” to discuss findings. As mentioned earlier, this dissertation
is embedded in a larger study, which is run by a research team. Through weekly
meetings with both the larger team and my adviser, many of whom also attend the
schools and know the participants, outside checks on preliminary findings have been
gathered. Additionally, the initial set of open codes for school DD was read by a

77

researcher who also attended sessions at the school to see if these codes were
appropriate.

TRANSFERABILITY
This study has a limited sample size that is not representative of other environments,
even those with populations similar in age and interest level. Instead, the findings of
this study are meant to spark other questions and to entice researchers to continue in
this conceptual framework and topic of study.
DEPENDABILITY
Dependability, defined by Marshall and Rossman (2011) as “showing the ways by
which the research plans to account for changing conditions in the phenomenon
chosen for study and changes in the design created by an increasingly refined
understanding of the setting” (p. 253), was addressed through iterative design changes
as the study progressed from school to school. Each school had unique characteristics,
just as each participant was unique, so the study was of course changed as external
contexts changed.
CONFIRMABILITY
Although, again, this dissertation is not intended to reflect complete objectivity, the
triangulation mentioned above is one step to approaching confirmability of researcher
conclusions. Yin (2009) suggests that physical artifacts, while not traditionally
relevant to case studies, can be “an important component in the overall case” (p. 113).
Indeed, the artifact-producing data collection strategies employed in this study
included word association lists produced by participants, the notes participants’
78

placed on the credibility screenshot poster, and the answers participants wrote on
their surveys. These were useful to confirming answers recalled in field notes and for
observing those instances when a participant’s statements did not match his or her
writing.
In addition, Maxwell (1996) suggests multiple analysis techniques, many of
which were employed in this study, including: searching for alternative explanations;
searching for discrepant evidence and negative cases; soliciting feedback from those
familiar with the setting (the aforementioned research team); and collection of rich
data (pp. 92-98). For example, to check the analysis of statements as positive or
negative about government and e-government, two members of the research team
independently analyzed 15 statements about government and 15 statements about egovernment, chosen randomly. (All analyzed statements had previously been inserted
into an Excel spreadsheet; the statements chosen for verification were in the lines of
the numbers chosen by an online random number generator.) Out of the thirty
statements, twelve statements differed in some way between my answers and the two
researchers. Three of these differences were due to one of the other team members
choosing two categories (e.g. I chose negative, one of the other researchers chose
both negative and neutral) or another team member rating uncertain survey responses
as positive (I, along with the other team member, rated these as neutral statements). In
one case, a team member was not sure of the polarity and simply left it blank. In
another case, a team member seemed to have read the question wrong (a participant
disagreed that elected officials cannot be trusted – a positive evaluation that would be
easy to read as negative because of the double negative).
79

The reasons for the remaining differences are categorized below and
explained by discussing one or more of the examples of statements that team
members and I coded differently. This process shows how I dealt with statements that
might not have been clearly positive, negative or neutral.
•

Reason One: Caution

One statement for which the team members and I differed was “I would define
government as private, secret, and important.” I, along with one of the team
members, rated this as neutral. One team member said that it was “positive and
kind of negative.” The second researcher’s response is precisely why I used the
neutral designation. It is possible the participant was being positive for some of
these words, but it is also possible they were intended to be negative. When
unsure of the polarity, I erred on the side of caution and categorized the
statement as neutral. (A similar thought process was used for one of the other
discrepancies, the statement “war.”)
•

Reason Two: Context

The following is a statement a participant made about government:
“I think a government agency site is just as reliable as an insurance site
because if you think about it, insurance, they want your money and they
collect money if you die so they probably won't give you the correct
information...Well, government collects taxes. Insurance gives taxes to the
government.”
I categorized this as negative, while both team members chose positive. While
initially surprised, I realized that the context of the quote within the larger
80

conversation in which it occurred made its polarity much more clear. This was
true for two of the other discrepancies in coding.
•

Reason Three: Researcher Viewpoint

The last two differences in codes were more amorphously related to researchers’
individual categorization systems. In the first example, a participant said he or
she thought government sites are helpful, but then went on to explain his or her
reasoning by comparing dot org sites with dot com sites. I, along with one team
member, categorized this as a positive evaluation, despite the apparent confusion
in what exactly dot gov sites are. Another team member interpreted it as neutral.
In the second example, a participant stated that, to find health information,
“Government would not be my second choice. Well I can't say that, it would
probably be...now that I'm reading the rest of these, it probably would be my
second choice.” The team members interpreted this as a positive evaluation,
while I saw the equivocation as representing a more neutral viewpoint.
This check with outside researchers allowed me to question my own assumptions as
to why I had coded statements with the polarity I did. The differing codes did not
change any of my personal codes, but they did allow me to see how others might have
coded differently and prompted me to elaborate in this section on why I used the
system I did.
Another measure of confirmability that was specifically directed at checking
the process of establishing participants’ overall perceptions of government was the
comparison of their negative/positive perception counts with their answers to two of
the survey questions. The survey asked participants to answer (on a 5-point Likert
81

scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree) two questions specifically related to
evaluations of government:
1. The government really cares what people like my family and I think.
2. In general, elected officials (e.g., senators, members of city council,
governor, president) cannot be trusted.
While respondents’ answers to these questions were coded as positive and negative
and included in the counts described above, it is also useful to use a participant’s
answers to these questions as a check on what all of the statements in the program
showed was a participants’ overall attitude toward government. In other words, if a
participant answered that the government does not care what people like he or she
thinks and generally cannot be trusted, but was coded as being overall positive about
government, there might be problems with the way positive and negative codes were
assigned. 10 Fortunately, once the participants’ answers of “unsure” and the “NED”
and “neutral” participants were removed, there were only five answers that contrasted
with the participant’s calculated general perception. None of the participants’ general
perception was contradicted by both questions. All five discrepancies were for the
question “The government really cares what people like my family and I think.” Two
participants (LMM-BB, LR-CC) who were generally positive about government,
disagreed that the government really cares, while three participants (ACW-CC, MSCC, and S117) were overall negative about government, but did think that

10
There is one important caveat about connecting the survey answers to the data compiled from the
rest of the data instruments. The survey is not measuring exactly the same things as the other
instruments. The general perception “assigned” to a participant uses data gathered from multiple points
in time and the survey answers only capture a singular opinion.

82

government cared about people like them.The full results of this comparison can be
found in Appendix Seven.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The HackHealth study (and, thus, this study by the nature of how it was conducted)
was reviewed and approved by the University of Maryland’s Institutional Review
Board.The research, to my knowledge, did not have any negative effects on the
participants (and was in fact intended to benefit them directly). That said, there were
certain ethical considerations as data was collected and analyzed. Perhaps the most
significant was the power imbalance between the participants and the researchers.
Because of traditional adult-student relationships in schools, in which the adult is
presumed some degree of authority over the students, and because the HackHealth
program takes place in the school setting (albeit in the school library, usually a more
casual environment than a classroom), the adult researchers were likely presumed to
have at least some degree of authority. This worked well for instruction, but lessened
the degree of accuracy in seeing how youth interact among their peers without adult
interference. To mitigate this power differential, we attempted to ensure each
participant’s privacy while recording their conversations, all participants were asked
to contribute, not just the outspoken, and all participants were treated with respect.
Constant awareness of this issue was highly important throughout the program and
data collection.

83

CHAPTER 4: FINDINGS
The following chapter discusses findings based on the data collection strategies
outlined in chapter three. Study participants’ perceptions of government and egovernment are discussed first, followed by a comparison of these perceptions.

RQ #1: WHAT ARE HACKHEALTH PARTICIPANTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF
GOVERNMENT?

At the outset of this study, researcher-assigned definitions of the term “government”
were left intentionally vague. This was a conscious decision made in order to uncover
how these participants arrived at their opinions on government. In other words, one
aspect of the research question was uncovering what concepts of government figured
into the formation of these youths’ perceptions. These conceptions were considered
with two sets of the data: 1) how participants defined government in their survey (in
answer to the question “How would you define ‘government’?”) and 2) an assessment
of the entirety of the statements made by participants about government and egovernment. These were coded as neutral, positive, or negative, and organized
according to the category of the evaluation.
PARTICIPANTS ’DEFINITIONS OF GOVERNMENT

84

In their definitions of “government,” participants 11 varied in the boundaries they
placed on the institution. Eight participants used the generic word “people” in their
definitions, such as Nunu’s (CC) answer that government is “A group of people that
make laws, also people who gather info of other places or jobs.” A few participants
mentioned the President or presidents specifically, either by defining the government
as a president (Un-AA; MS-CC; Kat-CC, Wal-DD) or by mentioning the President,
e.g. “Government - helps the president with decisions” (JtG-CC, as well as S4L-CC).
Other participants thought of government in terms of a place or area (Bat-AA, AnonBB, CIC-CC, Jess-DD, and F57-DD), a group (AL-DD), a service (SHK-CC), an
agency (Fl-DD), and “a thing” (TBA-CC). Sparten117 (AA) described the
government as “branches.” In addition to these conceptions, participants considered
the functions of government. Table 4.1 shows the most common:

“To me government is a group that ensures

“A place to protect our state” (F57-DD)
“The agency that runs a country” (Fl-DD)
“A service which helps to run and keep America
a civilized place” (SHK-CC)
“The people that control our society” (Gab-DD)
“…they steal our taxes to give to other countries””
(JJ-BB)
“A thing where people collect taxes and help
other people” (ACW-CC)

Other participants described the government as “secret” (DW-AA; Mar-CC), fair (PPAA), “somewhat” untrustworthy (ND-BB), reliable and serious (HK-CC), and private
and important (Mar-CC). Many of the themes reflected in these definitions reoccur
throughout the data and will be discussed both in this chapter and in chapter six.
Overall, many of the definitions were neutral statements (e.g. the definition
offered by Fl-DD in Table 4.1), but many also demonstrated emotional responses
toward the government (e.g. JJ-BB’s definition). We turn to these evaluative
statements next.
THE FOCUS OF PARTICIPANTS’ EVALUATIONS OF GOVERNMENT
The next section examines the factors through which participants filtered their
evaluations of government, as well as whether these evaluations were positive or
negative. Table 4.2 identifies five categories taken from the literature on trust and
government (Hetherington, 1998), as these categories aligned with the types of
assessments participants made, and from the data.

Hetherington (1998) quotes Citrin (1974)
and Citrin and Green (1986) who, in past
studies, found that “political trust is most

The sections that follow describe both the positive and negative perceptions of
participants within these categories. This organization demonstrates the frequency
with which participants had polar opposite opinions on similar issues. For example,
while many participants stated their belief in the government’s equity, other
participants said that they believe the government is unfair. Other themes included
trust, economics, effectiveness, helpfulness, and knowledge. In addition to these
general evaluations, more specific themes, including government secrecy and
surveillance, terrorism, and government defense emerged from both the positive and
negative statements. While the sections below demonstrate examples of the
participants’ positive and negative statements in general, chapter six will return to
these themes to discuss the implications of the participants’ foci and evaluations.
E VALUATING G OVERNMENT THROUGH O PINION OF I NSTITUTIONS

While participants did not often mention specific institutions, many of their positive
statements reflect an assessment of the people who run the country. Percy Potter (AA)
listed in his word association the term “leadership” to describe government. Coffee
Ice Cream (CC-I) said government is “something like a second president,” which
means “they help run the United States, and you know, keep it good, not bad and
stuff.” In his interview, Flash (DD-I) said government means “a type of agency or
type of group that runs the country and helps makes the country better.” Ana Lynch
(DD) said she believed that “the government is a group to keep people secure, and
safe,” and when asked if she trusted them, she replied in the affirmative.
88

The lack of specificity in institution may be due to a lack of knowledge; in
one instance, a researcher asked participants to give her an example of a trusted
source. Cap’n Crunch (DD) answered “The FDC,” but could not recall what it stood
for past “Federal” (RTON). Additionally, seven (out of 32) respondents answered the
survey question “What is a government agency? If you can, give an example” with, “I
don’t know,” “?,” “I’m not sure,” or left the question blank.
Some negative assessments focused on elected officials. Chocolate Rain (CC)
and Unknown (AA) both mentioned that elected officials often say one thing, but do
another. More specifically, Chocolate Rain (CC-I) said that “when people run for
governor and stuff like that, they tell you one thing and then they win and they don't
come through with what they said.” Unknown (AA-WA) referenced that politicians
make promises during campaigns, “oh I'm going to do this this this and this” but in
fact “they don't do any of that.” The survey also specifically asked respondents
whether they felt elected officials could be trusted. Eleven participants (just over onethird) either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement.
Political parties came up at school AA. Unknown (AA-WA) mentioned
“Republicans” in his word association, which prompted Nightwing (AA) to note that
he doesn’t “like them.” Unknown agreed, saying he “go[es] for Democrats.” Batman
(AA-WA) mentioned that he had heard “that many people, many Republicans, only a
small party refused that President Barack Obama [should] be President. For some
reason.” He elaborated that he thinks that is “wrong because it was two mixed
presidents so far. Frederick Douglas and President Barack Obama.” Putting aside the
incorrect history, it was clear that, while he did not know why the other party disliked
89

the President, he equated it in some way to race. Cap’n Crunch (DD-I) echoed these
sentiments when he told a researcher that, since he is Hispanic, he feels “offensive
[offended] when Republicans made decision about immigration.”

E VALUATING G OVERNMENT THROUGH O PINION OF THE P RESIDENT

Surprisingly few of the students evaluated the President at all during the program.
Many wrote “the President” in their word associations and all respondents to the
survey knew that Barack Obama is the current U.S. President, but none of these
answers carried any sort of judgment either way. Batman (AA-I) did elaborate on his
assertion of the government’s usefulness “in information” with the explanation that
“President Barack Obama usually has meetings…to declare laws, how will the laws
be treated, why do we need the laws, and how good the laws will be when you
announce them.” On the more negative side, during one session at school BB Natsu
Dragniel, Jazzy Jay, and Anonymys had a discussion about whether the President is
“a puppet” because, as JJ opined “you say you care about the people, you should have
enough time or something to at least write the speeches to say to the people.”
Anonymys reminded the group that he has to “sign bills,” but JazzyJay was
undeterred (WAR).
E VALUATING G OVERNMENT T HROUGH P OLICIES AND P OLICY O UTCOMES

While mentions of specific policies were rare, participants frequently talked about
government decisions and actions generally. Among the positive statements
90

representing this evaluation, Dr. Who (AA-I) said that the government “can make
really good decisions to help lots of the people.” LolaRam (CC) wrote in her word
cloud about government “helpers” and further clarified that she thinks “the
government helps you in paper, work, and money.” Agent Chicken Wing (CC-S)
defined government as “A thing where people collect taxes and help other people”
and Flash (DD-I) said that the government is “good” and that “they help the
environment and people…like the communities.”
Some participants had a positive view of government as it related to jobs or
the economy. Ana Lynch (DD) for example wrote “high quality job” in her word
association for government. Agent Chicken Wing (CC) noted that “when we get our
tax, it goes to the government and then helps us, so I think that's good.” Similarly,
Batman (AA) told an interviewer “Government means to me, like as a part of our life,
like taxes. Taxes help, benefit people if they're cops, police, usually they get
reductions and that money, that money that they have goes back to them too. Because
you know you get income tax which goes back to you.”
Evaluations of government’s policies were not all positive, however. Two of
the participants noted that they do not like it when the government makes decisions
with which they do not agree. Jay the Greatest (CC-I) said that “at times it
[government] could have a point, but sometimes it needs to help people out more
cause sometimes we may not agree with what they say.” Queen Pam (CC-I) agreed,
saying “You can trust them a little, but not sometimes because they may make
decisions without us agreeing on it.”

91

Sparten117 (AA-WA) asserted that the government “make[s] stupid laws” and
referenced that in the state in which the research took place and where he lives,
“there's pretty much taxes on everything and my dad's really mad.” Sweet Hershey
Kiss (CC-WA) also had concerns over monetary policy:
I have trust issues when it comes to money. Think about it….When you first
start dealing with the government when you become an adult, you have to go
through forms, beginning to get tax money and having to pay tax money, and
when it comes to the government, sometimes they try to out cheat you with
your money.
Natsu Dragniel (BB-WA) negatively referenced the government’s funding of wars,
saying that “they…get into other countries’ business.”
In a few cases there were discussions about specific policies. One of these
instances was the Ebola outbreak of 2014. Kira (DD) thought that the government
responded “pretty well” to the scare and Morgan Rice (DD) remembered that “they
didn't let some people from East Africa in” and that she “kind of did agree that they
were checking them and then they did let them come in, but they had to get a checkup to see if they had Ebola.” When a researcher asked the group for an example of a
time the government “screwed up” (echoing the words of participant), Nightwing
(AA-WA) answered “ObamaCare…A whole lot of people didn't like ObamaCare. I
don't know why, but I just know ObamaCare was a problem.”
E VALUATING G OVERNMENT BASED ON M EDIA ’ S A TTITUDE TOWARD G OVERNMENT

92

Many students connected their distrust of either the government or the media with
their perception of the other. Sweet Hershey Kiss (CC-CS) said she would not go to
government agency websites for information, because she has “kind of a trust issue
with the government. They change their story all the time, just like the news, that's
why I didn't choose news websites. Cuz there's no way on TV there can be news at 5,
news at 6, they're just changing the story up a little bit and replaying on TV.” She
mentioned in another session that she does not read the newspaper “because it's not
worth it” (SHK-CC-WA). When asked how she finds out about issues, she said she
mostly gets alerts on her phone or her mother tells her things. She said, however, that
“most of the time [she doesn’t] really trust…so many things have happened and the
government have made promises that they've never been able to keep.” ACW (CCWA) said she does not like the news because it scares her. She agreed with Marie and
SHK that “the media does have a big impact because something might happen, but
what the media tells us might not be true” and when asked whether she thought the
government has influence over what the media says, she replied that “maybe they
bribe them to say this or that.”
Many of the students gave examples of learning things about the government
from media. Most of these statements were negative and many of the anecdotes
mentioned are conspiracy theories. This information came from both entertainment
and the news. Kira (WW-WA) learned about Area 51 from a documentary she saw on
the Discovery Channel, Ms. Sterious (CC-WAR) thought she heard about it from the
movie Monsters vs. Aliens, and Mr. Paste said he gets his information on the
government’s secrets from a show that airs on weekend nights on (he thinks) the CW.
93

Chocolate Rain (CC-I) just mentioned she learned about these types of theories
online:
There're a lot of theories when you go online…because the world is really
overpopulated and [the government] secretly knows the cures to these things
[that] they're not exposing…like the guy who had Ebola, how come the nurse,
the patient died, the nurse died, but then one of the researchers who caught it,
he's still alive? I don't trust them!
Some of the information was more vaguely sinister, such as ACW’s (CC-ON)
account that she saw on CNN that the government is “planning something.” While
she could not remember the details, she said “I know it’s bad…” JazzyJay (BBWAR) remembered that she has heard about “these policemen raping…girls” and
notes to her fellow participants that they would have heard about it too “if [they]
listen to the news...”
Some of the media’s information that taught participants about the
government was more positive. Morgan Rice (DD-I) mentioned that she “heard…on
NPR or something, that [the government] checks all our text messages…That
someone gave out the secret,” but she thinks that is okay because of the threat of
terrorism. Kira offered as a reason for her positive assessment of the government’s
response to Ebola, “As you can see in the news, there's not a lot more cases of it.” A
few of the participants even learned about government websites from the media.
Cap’n Crunch (DD-WA) noted that government websites make him think about
exercise because “sometimes there are commercials that say every child should get
active at least an hour a day. And then go to this website, something I can't
94

remember…like getactive.gov or getmoving.gov.” Unknown (AA-I) heard about a
government website for healthcare on the news and Dr. Who (AA-WA) mentioned
that he connects health to government because he had heard ads for healthcare.gov.
E VALUATING G OVERNMENT IN G ENERAL

Some of the participants’ perceptions either were based on a non-specific idea of
government or on one that they did not specifically state. For example, many of the
participants described the government as trustworthy. Participants phrased this in a
variety of ways. When asked in an interview whether they trusted the government,
both Morgan Rice (DD) and Ana Lynch (DD) simply said yes. Hopekeeper (CC)
listed “trustworthy” in her word association. Morgan Rice (DD) noted in her survey
that “The government stands up for our rights and laws.” None of these statements
clarified how the participant was defining government, however.
This happened with negative assessments as well. Marie (CC-WA), for
example, explained that though she trusts the government
to a level, it depends on what they're talking about. There's been a couple of
cases where they haven't been particularly honest about what they're doing or
what is happening and they make people think all these things are happening
and in reality they're not.
In response to a researcher’s questioning whether she trusts government,
NinjaGirl (BB-CS) mentioned that the government “can take your house away.”
Though she was sure they could not take kids away, they do “take their houses, their
car, their money, their phone.” This seemed to be from personal experience as she
95

told the researcher that she knows someone to whom this has happened. Participants
also brought up more general ideas of inequality. Chocolate Ice Cream (CC) wrote in
her word association that the government is “mean with Spanish people.” Presumably
these opinions are referring to either specific government policy or officials, but the
participants did not elaborate on which.

PERCEPTION OF GOVERNMENT: PARTICIPANTS’ OVERALL ATTITUDES
As was expected, participants generally did not have only negative or only positive
things to say about the government. For example, during one word association
activity, Batman (AA) stated “Government gives rules [positive], but some rules are
iffy and they basically don't make sense [negative].” Thus, the analysis strategy
outlined in chapter three was useful in gaining a better understanding of participants’
dominant attitudes. Using the participants’ total number of positive and negative
statements about government, Table 4.3 below lists the participants in either the
positive, negative, or neutral categories.

As demonstrated by Table 4.3, participants were almost as equally likely to have a
positive perception of government as they were to have a negative one. The
categories of participants’ perceptions make it clear that these perceptions are based
on a variety of inputs, foci, and themes, which will be discussed more in chapter six.

RQ #2: WHAT ARE HACKHEALTH PARTICIPANTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF EGOVERNMENT?

While the survey asked participants to define government, for e-government the goal
was to find out if the participants had any knowledge of government websites. The
survey asked “What is a government website? If you can, give an example.” The
second research question has been answered with both the answer participants gave to
this question and an analysis similar to that of government using the entirety of the
data set coded as to being about e-government.
PARTICIPANTS ’ KNOWLEDGE OF E-GOVERNMENT
The participants’ answers to the question of what government websites are fit into six
categories, with some answers fitting multiple types:
1. Definition (Correct)
2. Definition (Positive)
97

3. Definition (Function)
4. Example (Correct)
5. Example (Incorrect)
6. Unsure
An answer was deemed correct if it somehow connected dot gov websites to being
made, run, or owned by the government. An example was deemed correct if it
included a URL ending in dot gov that exists or was a dot org that was run by the
government. Conversely, an incorrect example listed a site that does not exist or a
URL ending in something other than dot gov. A functional definition did not
necessarily equate the site to government, but instead provided a use for the site – to
look up information for example. Finally, a positive definition used a descriptor that
expressed something good about government websites, i.e. that they can be trusted
(Bat-AA) or that they are “vital” (MP-CC).
Of the 32 participants who filled out the survey, half left the question blank,
answered that they did not know, or otherwise indicated their lack of knowledge.
Three of the other 16 participants offered incorrect examples of this type of website –
Ana Lynch (DD) wrote “a pbs.org website” and “maybe nlh.gov, I forgot the name,”
Foxy57 (DD) wrote “www.government.com,” a website that does not exist, and
Soccer4Life (CC) wrote that a local newspaper’s website “sometimes talks about the
government.” Of the 13 participants who answered the question correctly in some
way, three simply mentioned that the government made or owned the sites (ACG-CC;
Jess-DD, and Kir-DD). Others gave examples of government sites or listed a function
of government websites. In the former case, three listed healthcare.gov (PP, Un, and
98

S117, all from school AA and, in this case, all seated next to each other while
completing the survey). One student wrote cdc.gov (Kat-CC) and one listed a dot com
address that was nevertheless a local government school district website homepage
(CC-DD).
The students who wrote functions largely focused on the fact that the sites
provide information. Health information was a focus (easily explainable by the nature
of the after-school program during which the survey was administered) (DW-AA; the
aforementioned healthcare.gov). Students also mentioned taxes (DW-AA), laws (KatCC), and general information (MP-CC, Jes-DD, and Bat-AA). Those that were
positive about the sites said they were helpful (DW-AA) or gave trusted information
(LMM-BB).
The surveys were only one set of data collected that offered insight into
participants’ knowledge of e-government. From other data, participants showed a
broader understanding, though misunderstandings were still apparent. Many of the
participants who were unsure of the answer about e-government in the survey made
statements that seemed to suggest they knew more than the survey would suggest.
Coffee Ice Cream (CC), for example, listed in her word association that dot gov sites
were “government info.” Morgan Rice answered in the HLAT that she “chose dot gov
because the government writes it so [she] trust the government [sic].” It is possible
that the respondents were not aware of examples and that is why they answered the
survey the way they did.
Regardless of how they formally defined government websites, many
participants demonstrated continued confusion of what government websites actually
99

are. Ana Lynch (DD), for example, who generally seemed to have had experience
with government websites (after a researcher asked during the word association
whether there was anything special about government websites, she answered that
“it’s dot gov”; she used cancer.gov for her final project in the after-school program),
seemed to identify dot org sites with dot gov sites. After a researcher asked during an
interview whether she had been to any government sites other than one she had
mentioned already (the National Library of Medicine), she answered yes. The
researcher followed up by asking how she had found out about the sites, such as
through Google. She answered “sometimes the websites, they really gave information
on the topic I was using. So one that I used for the 1960s, I was searching up motown,
and it had motown museum.org”
Other students seemed to believe that government agency websites are only
about government as the following interview segments demonstrate:
•

Researcher: Okay how about you? Which one would you not go to? Or the
least likely that you'd go to?
LMM (BB): Government agency websites and religious/cultural websites?
R: Why not?
LMM: Because they like deal with the government and they talk about
politics. And religious/cultural websites because they deal with like
religious stuff.

•

Researcher: If you've never used a site with dot gov, do you have an
opinion about it?
LolaRam (CC): It's something about governments right?
100

A common source of confusion among participants was about the authorship and
creation of government websites. During the word association with Sparten117,
Batman, Nightwing, Unknown, and Percy Potter (all AA), no one seemed quite sure
who makes government websites:
Researcher: Who do you think makes those websites?
All: Government
R: Who in the government?
N: The president
B: I forgot who the governor is.
PP: Maybe the vice president?
S117: I think they might have their own like special thing where there's a
group of people that design it.
PP: Somebody who is very good with computers.
Some of this confusion manifested in reasons given for liking or disliking egovernment that were incorrect. For example, when LilMarMar (BB) answered a
researcher’s question about what she liked about a government website she had been
to, she said she “thought that it was easy to trust, because dot gov websites, you can
trust them because they're run under a government or sometimes run under a
university.” Dr. Who (AA) said the feature he liked best about government websites
was that “some government websites ask you questions if you need, and it wouldn't
take long for them to answer, you would get the answer in a few days and it's easy to
know more about it because they would give…detail[s].” A researcher followed up

101

by asking if he meant that he could post a question to the site. Dr. Who replied yes,
and that the website would answer. 12
Contradictory opinions also represented this general confusion. Consider the
following exchange that took place during the interview with Queen Pam (CC)
(italics added for emphasis):
Researcher: What do you think about dot gov sites in general?
QP: It gives a lot of information, and it's really helpful
R: Okay. Do you believe it, the information?
QP: Some
Then, later in the conversation:
R: [QP], what do you like best about dot gov websites?
QP: That you can trust the website
This is not an isolated incident. In fact there were far more egregious examples of
contradictory attitudes. Jazzy Jay (BB) demonstrated disconnect between her opinion
of government and e government, as did Agent Chicken Wing (CC). On her health
literacy assessment, JazzyJay wrote down that she chose the URLs dot org, dot gov,
dot edu “because the websites seem more accurate,” but claimed several times during
the program that the government gives false information. Agent Chicken Wing noted
during the card-sorting exercise that she would “choose the Internet because say you
want to learn about a disease like cancer. It's going to pop right up and to see if it's

12

While it is possible that this feature exists, I have yet to come across it on a government website. It
seems like he may be getting that site mixed up with the AskUsNow feature on many library websites.

102

accurate you search other websites. I recommend dot gov,” but was then reminded by
a researcher that she had “just said a minute ago that you wouldn't ask the
government. But the government creates the dot gov websites. So...?” Agent Chicken
Wing simply replied “Oh. When I ask, well I go on the Internet for websites [unclear]
a search engine. I'll use Google.” These examples are not meant to disparage the
participants. Rather, they show a critical gap in understanding of the connection
between government and government websites and in knowledge of e-government
generally.

PARTICIPANTS ’ EVALUATIONS OF E-GOVERNMENT
The evaluations of e-government are organized into categories indicating the aspects
of government websites that influenced the participants’ perceptions. These
categories and definitions are listed in Table 4.4. Many of these categories mirror
those found in the literature on credibility assessment, which makes sense due to both
the nature of the questions asked in certain data instruments about credibility, as well
as the emphasis on website credibility assessment during the after-school program.
That said many of the assessments were based on relevance, usefulness, and other
metrics, which is generally clear in the participants’ statements.

E VALUATIONS B ASED ON S URFACE C HARACTERISTICS

Some participants mentioned characteristics such as dates and aesthetics in their
evaluations. Katniss (CC) observed that the CDC page she visited had a recent date
which meant that she could trust the information and LolaRam (CC) used the look of
the site to explain her feeling that it was “trustful” (BON). Other participants liked
the amount of information government websites provide. Agent Chicken Wing (CC),
for example, noted in her word association that dot gov websites have “a lot of
information.”
On the other hand, LolaRam (CC), did not like the design of a government
website she visited, expressing her dissatisfaction with the color and saying it “looks
old” (BON). Katniss (CC) was not fond of a CDC site because it “had too much to
read and that it should have something you can press to enlarge the type ‘because it’s
a lot!’” (BON). At the same time, Mr. Paste (CC) noted that alzheimers.com did not
have “a lot of info” showing either the participants’ differing expectations or the
differences in the content of different government pages.
E VALUATIONS B ASED ON M ESSAGE AND C ONTENT

Some participants focused more on the content itself. Several wrote in their word
associations that the information is “important” (HK-CC, Mar-CC, and SHK, CC).
Katniss (CC) also mentioned importance during her interview. When evaluating
Alzheimers.gov during the poster screenshot activity, Dr. Who (AA) wrote that the
site “Helps with answers to the problem” and Sparten117 (AA) noticed the questions
104

and answers section. Mr. Paste (CC) wrote in the survey that a government website is
“a place with information vital to us.” Queen Pam (CC) told her interviewee that a
government sites “gives a lot of information and it's really helpful.”
Cap’n Crunch (DD) chose government agency websites during card-sorting because
“they usually use trusted resources” and Nightwing (AA) said “they get valid
information. They usually back up with evidence and they give a whole bunch of
reasons, well not reasons, but information on Alzheimers.”
Soccer4Life (CC-CS), however, perceived government websites to
occasionally offer information that is too specific for her needs; she does not like
when she is looking for basic information and “they start giving all this information
about one thing.” Coffee Ice Cream (CC) had a variety of negative things to say about
the content in her word association list; she wrote that “dot gov sites “List less
important things,” have a “Little bit of info,” are “top secret,” and are “sometimes
useless.” Kira (DD-PS) thought there were too many opinions on the page: “Well ‘the
burden,’ words are just opinions, it's kind of just of a more biased to me than states
you want, you don't want other people's opinions.”
Other evaluations were about features of the site, such as video or pictures.
Batman (AA-PS), for example, liked that alzheimers.gov gave “a video to look at.”
On the other hand, when evaluating the alzheimers.gov homepage during the poster
screenshot activity, Anonymys (BB) had a mixed evaluation because of the inclusion
of the YouTube video:
“It's dot government, so the government, I'll assume made it, or had help with
it, but it's good, yet bad, because of YouTube. And the person on YouTube
105

might not be an expert on Alzheimer's or this could be a very old website and
the information could be outdated.”
E VALUATIONS B ASED ON URL

Many participants simply answered “it is dot gov” (such as S117-AA and MP-CC
during their respective poster screenshot activity) to describe why a government
website should be trusted. They seemed to be relying on an established belief in a
website with this URL suffix. Similarly, in their more general descriptions of what
they thought of dot gov sites during word association, several participants used
synonyms of credible, including “reliable” (Anon-BB) and “trustworthy” (HK-CC
and LMM-BB) without specifically mentioning that the reason is because of the
source (government) or because someone told them that dot gov means reputable.
Rather, they simply took this credibility for granted.
E VALUATIONS B ASED ON R ECOMMENDATION

Interestingly, not many of the participants mentioned explicitly that they evaluated
government websites based on a teacher’s influence. Hopekeeper (CC) did describe in
an interview that she would trust dot gov or dot edu sites more because “that's just
what our teachers tell us, that's more secure, where you can get the information.”
Batman (AA-I) explained that government sites are useful (emphasis mine):
Why? Because they help you out in the information that you really want and
that information…will benefit you if you have a special assignment that you
have to do and it would basically be a breeze, because you're going to look on
the internet and you're already thinking, okay I already know what to do and
106

this is going to be easy. I have the website that I'm going to link to the project
and then the teacher will be impressed, like okay good.
Overall, however, the subject of suggested use from authority figures was not a
central feature of the young people’s assessments.
E VALUATIONS BASED ON I NFORMATION S OURCE

Many of the participants cited the expertise of both the government and the experts
who they thought created the sites as reasons for their positive perceptions. Marie
(CC-CS) stated that, for school, she “would go to a government-approved website.”
She knows “nothing about history, [she is] not a history person…And government
most of the time are smarter than me, so it's okay.” Hopekeeper (CC) wrote during
word association that dot gov sites have “Information from doctors themselves.”
Several students mentioned that they trust the sites specifically because they are from
the government. Soccer4Life (CC-CS) gave one reason: “Because they know exactly
what's going on and they just write about it.” Anonymys (BB-I) said he tends to trust
government sites because they are “regularly checked by the government, and they
know what they're putting on there. And they're like military experts, or experts in
general.” During poster screenshot activities, Morgan Rice (DD) asserted that the
government is “more reliable because they're not expected to lie.” Percy Potter (AA)
said during an interview that he thought “the government wouldn't just put like some
random things on it…” During card-sorting, ACW (CC) recommended dot gov sites
to confirm information found on other sites.

107

Other students liked government websites because the established credibility
of the source meant they were easier to use. For example, Anonymys’s (BB-I)
favorite thing about government sites was that they do not require having to “try to
criticize, see if it's fake or not.” Dr. Who (AA-I) noted that he had first found out
about government websites in sixth grade when he was looking for information on a
science fair project. He told the researcher that he ended on government websites
because “…When [he] searched it, most were like Wikipedia, that's mostly where it
showed at all.” He did not trust Wikipedia when he “got on there [and] it said edit and
[he] knew that somebody could change it.”
Throughout the program, a considerable number of participants mentioned
safety and security in their assessments of government and government websites,
which were almost universally positive statements. Percy Potter, for example, noted
that government websites are probably “[done] by computer professionals so people
can't hack into the website and change stuff.” Nightwing noted that “government is
secure and there's not going to always be bad stuff on government websites.” Natsu
Dragniel (BB-WA) said he thinks government websites are “safe, secure,” as did
LilMarMar, Mr. Golden Man, and Anonymys (all BB). Additional examples of all of
these issues are found throughout chapters four and five.
Conversely, the vast majority of participants’ negative opinions of egovernment were also credited to the source of the information. Marie (CC-WA)
explained that her perception that government websites are “someone's opinion,” that
they “can be facts…biases, they could be telling you what they want you to know and
not really telling you what's actually happened” is due to her “experience with the
108

government itself.” When a researcher asked if that had been her experience with
government websites, she explained that “dot gov has something to do with
government obviously, so I'm going on, my opinion, what happens with the
government, I have trust issues with the government, of course…so I have trust issues
with anything, well not anything, but a majority of things that have to do with the
government.”
After finding out that a website she had been using was in fact a government
site, ACW (CC-ON) said she did not trust it after all. MS (CC-ON) was also emphatic
that it shouldn’t be trusted. A researcher asked why and she answered that the
government is telling you fake stuff. During card-sorting, Batman (AA) said he would
not choose government agency websites because they are “random.” When asked
why they are random, he replied “Because the government is like a secret stuff. I'm
not gonna get into that, so I'm just going to leave it alone.”
Several participants cited their wariness of the government tracking their
searches when discussing e-government. During the word association discussion,
Percy Potter (AA) said that he thinks “government websites are good and bad…bad
because if you do one little thing like the government might be suspicious on you.”
Nightwing echoed this, saying that “you never know if the government could be
suspicious, like he said. And they can probably be spying on you and trying to get
some information and I know these days now governments going to be really spying
on some people because ISIS…” Sweet Hershey Kiss (CC) also made a reference to
this during her interview:

109

Dot gov, um to me that's like short for government, of course, so to me that's
clearly to stating to me that what I'm looking up the government knows that
I'm on and that they're monitoring me and they can see what I'm typing, I'm
scrolling, what I'm highlighting and everything. So using dot gov to me is
kinda like a little tense-y cause you know you're dealing with people who deal
with criminals and stuff like that.
E VALUATIONS BASED ON P RIOR E XPERIENCES

Participants who described previous experiences with government websites were
mostly positive. ACW (CC) said during the word association activity that she had
been to a dot gov website and she liked it. During her interview, ACW (CC)
described one government site she had been to – something like “government student
dot gov.” She said “shows history about the U.S., maps, different sorts of things” and
that the best thing about the site was that she “could find what she needed, that “it
was all there, everything.” Ana Lynch (DD) mentioned in her interview that the
National Library of Medicine site she had been to was “really easy” and that another
she visited “had a lot of information.” She also used cancer.gov for her final project
in the after-school program. Though she couldn’t remember the exact website she had
been to, LilMarMar (CC-I) said she “thought that it was easy to trust.” Katniss (CC-I)
said the site she used had “important information” and Queen Pam (CC-I) said the dot
gov site she used “gave a lot of information on the topic.”
PERCEPTION OF E-GOVERNMENT: PARTICIPANTS ’ OVERALL ATTITUDES

110

Just as with government, participants had a wide range of both positive and negative
opinions and perceptions of e-government. Each participant’s coded opinions about egovernment were counted and then totaled in the positive and negative categories.
The same process as was used for government perceptions above was applied to egovernment. Table 4.5 shows in which direction each participant leans.

As the Table 4.6 demonstrates, far more participants had overall positive perceptions
of government website than they did negative. Only six participants who provided
enough data in which to categorize made mostly negative statements.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
This chapter has examined the data to better understand participants’ perceptions of
government and e-government. Perceptions were considered on the basis of the
participants’ definitions and knowledge of the terms, as well as the evaluative
statements they offered throughout the period of data collection. Overall, participants
were slightly more likely to have a negative overall perception of government than
they were to have a positive one. This did not appear to have an effect on their
perception of government websites, however, as the vast majority of participants had
positive overall perceptions of e-government. Nevertheless, several key themes
regarding government information reoccurred throughout the data, which will be
explored in future chapters. In addition, chapter five will offer a deeper look at select
participants, bringing together the definitions, evaluations, and knowledge all
explored above.

112

CHAPTER 5: CASE STUDIES
Chapter five takes a different approach to data analysis by viewing select participants’
data as individual units rather than in aggregate. There are several reasons for viewing
the data in both ways. While chapter four gave a big picture overview of the trends in
this particular participant group, nuances of the data are lost. As was briefly
mentioned, contradictions were a major theme of many participants’ perceptions. It is
far easier to see the subtle ways that opinions differed across data collection activities
when looking at an individual participant’s responses. Viewing the participants as

113

individuals also allows for a more robust examination of the potential influences that
have shaped their opinions and perceptions.
This type of analysis where profiles are drawn on individual participants
within larger studies is common in the fields of learning science and identity studies
(see Barron, 2010 and Ito et al, 2009 for examples of this type of research). While this
dissertation does not fit into these fields, the exploration of a participant’s data in
order to see how his or her demographics, family influence, literacy skills, selfefficacy, and prior beliefs combine to form a perception of government and
government websites mirrors the intent of identity work. These profiles give us not
only a better understanding of these individual participants, but also of how the same
influences might interact in other young people forming their political and
information perceptions.
The five participants highlighted below demonstrate the range of attitudes
across the study's population. The first two highlighted are Percy Potter (AA) and
Kira (DD). These participants generally had positive views of both government and
government websites. Natsu Dragniel (BB) demonstrates a more neutral position,
although he did have much to say about government and e–government. However, he
lacks the vehemence of the participants with negative perceptions and also does not
show the optimism of the participants with largely positive perceptions. The two
participants with negative perceptions are Mr. Paste (CC) and JazzyJay (BB).
For each participant, a profile is drawn from their demographic data recorded
in the survey, from observations made throughout the program, and through

114

comments made during interviews and word associations. Then, general sketches of
both the participant’s opinion of government and government websites are presented.

PERCY POTTER: THE BELIEVER
“I USUALLY ASK OTHER PEOPLE FOR STUFF.”
Percy Potter is a fifth grade boy at School AA. He self-describes as Asian. He lives
with his mom and dad, but is unsure of what his parents do for work. When he grows
up, he wants to be a scientist or an architect. He does not own a cell phone, but does
have access to one working computer at home that can access the Internet. He has
used a mobile device to access the Internet as well. On his survey, he rates himself as
pretty good at using the Internet. In an interview, he mentioned that he is “pretty
confident” that he can find the information he is looking for because he “usually
ask[s] other people for stuff.” He also noted that he uses the Internet a lot.
Percy has a generally positive outlook on America, strongly agreeing with the
statements that people get fair treatment in America, no matter who they are, and that
in American a person has an equal chance no matter where he or she come from what
his or race is. He did mention that he is uncertain of whether most people can be
trusted, but seemed conflicted on this answer as he initially answered that he agreed
and changed his answer after some contemplation.
“IF SOMETHING’S WRONG, THEY TRY TO MAKE IT FAIR.”
Percy’s strategy for establishing the credibility of information strongly relies on
authority figures. He said that he “gather[s] the information. Then…check[s] if the
information is right,” when asked how he does this, he replied that he “ask[s] other
115

people, like teachers or people who know more about that” (WAR). He also strongly
disagrees with the idea that elected officials cannot be trusted, further displaying a
belief in authority.
Percy’s perception of the government aligns with this position on authority.
He stated during the word association activity that “The government helps the
country” and that “The government, if something's wrong, they try to make it fair.”
He also listed the words “order,” “peace,” “leadership,” and “protection” to describe
government. When asked if he trusted government, he did indicate some wariness:
“Yes because they help us when we're in need, like sometimes when we're in war
they would help us. And no because if we do something wrong …and we didn't really
do it, somebody else did, and the police or whatever is going against us.” This
concern was a minor part of his assessment however. Along with the positive
connections he made during the word association, on his survey, Percy indicated that
he strongly agrees with the statement “government really cares what people like my
family and me think.” He also defined government “as laws and fairness.”
“THE GOVERNMENT WOULDN ’T JUST PUT SOME RANDOM THINGS ON [A WEBSITE]”
Although Percy Potter had never visited government websites, he generally had a
positive perception of them. As with government, he indicated both positive and
negative qualities, saying that he thinks “they're bad because if you do one little thing
the government might be suspicious on you…” but also noted that “dot com, they're
usually for websites that you can make on your own, but dot orgs and dot gov are
usually…more protected” (WA). He also made mention of this protection in his
interview; when asked what he thought a dot gov site is, he said “I think it's a
116

government site, and it's a protected site, so people can't just hack into [it] really
easily.”
Despite his inexperience with the websites, he correctly named healthcare.gov
as an example on his survey. He also liked alzheimers.gov for its content and for the
fact that it is dot gov which he noted “usually means it’s true.” In his interview, he
asserted that dot gov sites “usually have better information and it's usually not
wrong.” When asked why he thinks that, he said “Because I think the government
wouldn't just put some random things on [a website].”
PERCY POTTER ’S PERCEPTIONS
Overall, Percy Potter has a positive opinion of both government and e-government.
He values both government and government websites for their protection and safety.
The fact that he has not used a dot gov website is likely due to his young age, as he is
a user primed to appreciate both the content and source of a government website.

KIRA: THE SKEPTIC
“FBI…THE AWESOME PART OF THE GOVERNMENT”
Kira is a seventh grade female who attends School DD. She self-describes as
Hispanic or Latino and lives with her mom and dad, as well as her three siblings. Her
parents are from Mexico and she speaks Spanish at home. When she grows up, Kira
would like to be a surgeon or a criminal investigator, specifically mentioning she
would like to work for the FBI. In a conversation about the government, Kira said she
117

thinks the FBI is “the awesome part of the government. I want to be a criminal
investigator or researcher. Or a lawyer.”
She owns a cell phone and has access to three computers at her home. She has
used a mobile device to access the Internet and says that she always accesses the
Internet from a phone or tablet and often from a laptop. She only sometimes uses a
desktop computer. She rates herself as pretty good at using the Internet. A researcher
recalled that Kira “specified that she looks for the more reliable sources on the
Internet. I asked her how she can tell and she said that she sees if the information
looks accurate and she compares the information across multiple sites to see if it
matches” (RTON).
Kira does not believe most people can be trusted. When a researcher asked her
about this, she “said she has a trust issue” (RTON). She was uncertain about whether
people have an equal chance in America regardless of where they come from or their
race, as well as whether the government really cares what people like her family and
she thinks. She agreed, however, with the idea that people get fair treatment in
America, no matter who they are.
“I’D PREFER TO KNOW. AT LEAST I’D KNOW WHAT’S GOING TO COME TO US.”
Kira has generally positive things to say about the government, but does have some
qualms about the secrets they keep. When asked to list words she associates with
government, Kira mentioned: taxes, the FBI, and CIA Area 51. When asked about her
mention of Area 51, she described it as “the place that everybody wonders about but
government never tells” and recalled that she “saw it on Discovery Channel, a
documentary about it. How about at first, it used to be small, but they grew it bigger
118

and much people they have around it and what they might be hiding.” She believes
they are hiding “Aliens. Or the zombie epidemic. The sickness. They probably have it
already in the world. Just that they're hiding it from us.” A researcher then asked if
she thinks the government hides a lot of stuff and Kira replied “Yes. Why would they
not allow us to see Area 51? Why wouldn't they allow us to know about it?” She said
she thinks keeping information from people is both “good and bad. Good because it
could keep the citizens from freaking out from all the secrets they might hide that
might be really major and bad because they're keeping us in the dark.” Ultimately,
however, she would “prefer to know. At least I'd know what's going to come to us.”
Despite this possible issue of trust, she generally views the government
positively. She defines government in her survey as “the people who give us laws,
order, and make sure we are in line and pay taxes.” She also indicated that she
disagrees that elected officials cannot be trusted. When asked what health-related
things the government does are, she said they “make sure our society doesn’t
collapse” (WA). She also thought the government responded to the Ebola outbreak of
2014 “pretty well…as you can see in the news, there's not a lot [of] cases of it
[anymore]” (WA). Overall, “she said she feels okay, but not too comfortable, about
the government” (RTON).
“ORGANIZATION OR GOVERNMENT WEBSITES ONLY.”
As with the government, Kira has a measured opinion of government
websites. She had not used a dot gov site and in her interview indicated that she had
not heard of them. Through other conversations, however, she did seem to have some
idea of what they are. During the word association activity, Kira identified dot gov
119

sites as “government owned websites.” In the same discussion, she said a person
might go to a government website “If [they] want to learn more about the
government. Or [what] they own,” such as “the Board of Education and…health, they
own almost everything.” She also recommended dot gov websites in the health
literacy assessment because they are “more accurate.” Similarly, when a researcher
asked what a good URL is versus a bad URL, she said “a good one is from the
government or organization, while company isn't as good because chances are they're
trying to sell you something” (WAR).
She did not completely trust dot gov sites, however. She mentioned that “the
government might just put information they want us to know and not the whole
piece” (PS). She also noted that she thought alzheimers.gov had “too many opinions,”
such as the words “the burden.” She also indicated that even if a site was a dot gov
site, if it was last updated in 2012, it “wouldn't be good” (PS). That said, in a list she
developed as her own personal credibility assessment guidelines, she indicated that
she would like to go to only organization or government websites (RTON).
KIRA’S PERCEPTIONS
Kira has a positive view of both government and e-government, but is more measured
in her assessments than Percy Potter. She acknowledges the government hides
information, but that does not affect her belief that dot gov sites (along with dot org)
sites have the most credible information.

NATSU DRAGNIEL, THE UNDECIDED
“I DON’T LIKE TO SOUND STUPID.”
120

Natsu Dragniel is an eighth grade male from School BB. His self-described race is
“swag,” and lives with his mom, dad, and a grandparent. His parents are from Peru
and Puerto Rico, and at home, he speaks English and Spanish. His father is a
policeman and his mother is and EMT. Both graduated from college. When he grows
up, he would like to go into the army and/or be a gamer. He owns a cell phone and
has used a mobile device to access the Internet. He has access to more than four
computers at his home and uses his phone “every day.”
Natsu rates himself as very good at using the Internet. He explained in his
interview that he uses skills his school media specialist taught him to check a
website’s author’s credentials. He also knows that “if it's safe to put money on, they
have like the little http and the lock on it.” He is confident that he can find the
information he is looking for, but is “always worried about if it's false information,
because…I don't like to sound stupid, so I don't want to talk to someone who actually
knows the thing that I'm talking about, like if I'm talking to a doctor about cancer…
say cancer only appears in the foot or something. Because then you just look like an
idiot.” Although he says that the majority of time he uses the Internet, he just watches
shows, when he does search for information, he gets help from his parents or his
grandma, who was an educator. She helps him “figure out what's legitimate, what's
not.”
“I DON’T LIKE TO DISAPPOINT ANYBODY…”
Natsu is conflicted about government. He has family that support and detract from the
institution, which makes him question who to believe. As he says in his interview,
“my uncle… ever since I was small, he's always put these things in my head about the
121

government…He's in the military. And almost everybody in my family's been in the
military… they put these ideas in my head, like the military- like the government's
like gone bad, and things have just gone just down the drain.” Then, however, he
mentions that when he goes to his mother “she's like the government's good. So then I
don't really know what to believe.” Natsu went on to say:
“I don’t like to disappoint anybody, so I don't want to be like the government's
bad in front of my mom, cause then I think she might feel sad, and then I don't
want to be like the government's good in front of my father's side of the
family, because they're all, everybody, actually on both sides of my family,
they've all been in the military, every last one of them.
Then, a researcher asked that if she posed the question ‘how do you feel about the
government,’ would he know how he felt? He replied that he would not.
He does express some opinions on government throughout other data
collection activities. On his survey, Natsu defines the government as “somewhat
untrustable.” He identified a government agency as the FBI and added that they “go
to find people.” He disagreed that the government cared what people like him and his
family think and agreed with the fact that elected officials cannot be trusted. In his
word association, Natsu listed words such as “favoritism,” “false information,” “war,”
and “killers” and explained that, when he wrote killers, he meant “they're not doing
anything to help out around. There's more homeless people, for every homeless
person in the U.S., they have around 6 houses. If they were to actually help them...”
He also offered additional incidents where he disagreed with the government’s

122

actions, such as “War. Like they fund wars...and they will get into other countries
business.” He also noted that “We're like billions of dollars in debt to China…”
All that said, he seemed to take the idea of government conspiracies less
seriously than some of his peers. When a fellow participant was asserting that Area
51 is real during the word association activity, Natsu joked that “they've got a big old
egg in there or something. Next thing you know Godzilla pops out and we're like we
knew it.” When a peer said that government might not be more honest about diseases
or conditions, Natsu explained that maybe “they don't want to cause a panic.” When a
fellow participant was exclaiming negatively that police officers are shooting “us,”
Natsu reminded her that police are “[there] to uphold the peace, but some of them are
just bad” and that she “can't really blame all of the police...” (WAR).
These conflicted opinions are apparent in his general attitude toward America
and his social trust as well. He strongly disagrees that people get fair treatment in
America, no matter who they are and that in America, you have an equal chance no
matter where you come from or your race. He strongly agrees, however, that most
people can be trusted.
“IT’S LIKE WATCHING HUNTER/ EX-HUNTER WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT THE
PASSWORD.”

Natsu does not have many feelings one way or the other about e-government, which
he explains is due to the fact that he has never been to a government site. The
perception that he does have is similar to his opinion of government – conflicted. In
his word association, he lists that government websites are “safe” and “secure,” but
also that they are “misleading, take a long time, [and] secretive,” words that were also
123

listed by the participants with whom he was sitting. His one experience with
government sites was with his father:
Well my dad works for the police and he went to a government website and he
typed in his username and password and everything just changed and told me
to go away. So secretive. It's like watching hunter/ex-hunter when you figure
out the password.
Overall however, a researcher recalled that he felt that government sites “would be
trustworthy because the government is the ‘top dog of the U.S.’” (RTON).
NATSU DRAGNIEL’S PERCEPTIONS
Natsu Dragniel has a positive opinion of government websites, but a negative opinion
of government. That said, the latter is clearly influenced by his family and peers. He
is a user who very well might be influenced by positive experiences with government
information.

MR. PASTE, THE “HATER”
“I’M SO CONFIDENT THAT I BLOW PEOPLE’S MINDS AWAY.”
Mr. Paste is a seventh grade male who attends CC middle school. He lives with his
Aunt, self-describes as Caribbean, and would like to be a journalist or an author when
he grows up. On his survey, Mr. Paste wrote that he disagreed that in America, people
have an equal chance no matter where they come from or their race, as well as with
the statement “Basically, people get fair treatment in American, no matter who they
are.” He was uncertain about whether most people can be trusted.

124

He owns a cell phone, but does not have any working computers in his home.
He does use a cell phone to access the Internet at home. He describes some ways he
checks to see if information on the Internet is credible, like using “people's reviews…
look[ing] up the person who made the website…if you find something that's on one
website…then go[ing] and look[ing] for it on another…” Indeed, he rates himself as
very good at using the Internet and in an interview noted that he feels very
comfortable with online search. In fact, he says “that's all I do when I'm at home, I'm
always on my phone,” and even said he fell down his stairs a couple times, as he was
on his phone and walking without looking. He says that when he got up he was in
pain, but “still continued to text.”
He is extremely confident that he can find the information for which he is
searching; “I'm so confident…it's just habit, I'm always confident, sometimes I don't
have it, but most of the time I do…I'm so confident that I blow people's minds away.”
In his free time, he writes and reads fanfiction on WattPad, which he discovered when
“this random thing popped up. I was like hmm what's this, read free books, write free
books, get followers, and stuff like that, so I clicked on it and then, there was this one
book, it just blew my mind.” His own writing has many followers; “I have one book,
I have two point seventy-two k readers, and a hundred and twenty-seven likes, eightythree comments, and the other book I have…it just got to the k's,” though he does
mention that the books that were not as successful he deleted. From his descriptions
of his hobbies and his self-assessment of his Internet skill, Mr. Paste is obviously
someone who spends a lot of time online.
“I DON'T USE THE WORD HATE A LOT, BUT I HATE THEM”
125

Mr. Paste is not a fan of government. In fact, he goes so far to say in an interview
that, while he does not use the word a lot, he “hate[s] them.” His definition of
government on the survey goes even further; he describes the government as “lying
douchebags who take our money for their own pleasure.” He seems to have at least
basic knowledge of government, answering that “A government agency is like FBI or
something related to that.” That said, on the whole, Mr. Paste thinks government is
“secretive,” that “they're so mean,” and that “they withhold information from us that
could really help us” which results in them “killing people just to get rid of them
because they're afraid that they can't survive.”
He says that the government is “just like the President [Obama],” and
elaborates that “he’s crazy.” This opinion presumably stems from something his aunt
told him either when he was first elected or last year that, in DC, people’s “insurance
cards weren't going to be able to be used because they started like putting chips inside
of people's arms like right there and they scan it.” It is not clear to what policy he is
referring, but it is entirely possible this is a conspiracy theory, as he is a big believer
of such stories. He describes several theories that he got from TV:
Yeah like they [the government] have secret societies, they have aliens but
they don't want to tell us, they're making alliances… and late night on
Saturdays…I think it was CW…It's telling about aliens…and the Egyptian
Pyramids. They were telling one about how the Egyptian Pyramids, they had
to be from outer space to see how to build it, and people on the ground
couldn't know how to build it, it would've been like tilted or something like
that, but it's like really, you can like see the top from outer space and it's like
126

shiny, yeah, so like there's aliens. And then there's this one, the government is
like hiding people, people…caught by aliens and then…people who are
turning up with like these chips in their heads and arms, and I was like this is
crazy. And then like, I remember once I thought I had this stuff in my arm and
I was like mom, I've been abducted by aliens, and she thought I was crazy. It
was really funny though.
When asked who the people are who are telling these stories, he answered that they
are “people who've been” and “alien experts.” Clearly Mr. Paste believes that the
government is so secretive based at least partially on these accounts. His negative
perception of government is shaped strongly by the media he uses.
DOT GOV? “WHAT IS THAT?”
Interestingly, Mr. Paste does not have such strong feelings about government
websites. Part of this disconnect may come from his uncertainty about what they are.
When asked if he had ever used a site ending with dot gov, he asked “What is that?”
When a peer reminded him, he gave examples of sites he had been to:
Oh yeah yeah, there's like this hospital thing, sometimes when cause the
hospital will like give out papers to learn about new diseases or flus or viruses
going around, and they always have like dot gov at the end. Like I remember
one time I went to PBSkids and there's like this one website that takes you to
this other website, it's like {LearnIn?} and it's dot gov
When asked what he thought about these (mostly non-governmental websites), he
replied that the PBS Kids site was confusing. This was also how he generally thought
of dot gov sites in general, but it was unclear whether he was referring to government
127

websites generally or dot org sites that he thought were government websites (such as
PBS Kids). He did seem to come around to the definition eventually, as later in the
interview, he explained that he “think[s] what it means by dot gov, cause it's a part of
the government, so it's knowledge from the government, and it's given to you.”
“YOU [WWW.ALZHEIMERS.GOV] HELP A LOT. YOU DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF INFO.”
His feelings on the usefulness of government websites also seemed somewhat
muddled. In his survey, Mr. Paste wrote that a dot gov website is a place with
information vital to us. During the poster screenshot activity, he described
alzheimers.gov as helping “because it's dot gov. [It] links to different parts, it says
find out more, what is alzheimer's disease…” and also wrote that the site “help[s] a
lot.” He also wrote, however, that the site “do[es] not have a lot of info,” which does
not seem to agree with the other assessments he made.
MR. PASTE’S PERCEPTIONS
Mr. Paste expressed an extremely negative view of government, but surprisingly had
a positive view of e-government. It is very likely that the latter is actually due to the
lack of knowledge he has of government websites. It is not clear that he actually
connects the two with each other. Regardless of his view of government websites, he
has a negative perception of government information in general, as he believes the
government is withholding information from the public.

JAZZYJAY: THE DOUBTER
“I’M NOT TRYING TO DO PLAGIARISM ALL WRONG.”

128

Jazzy Jay is an eighth-grade female who describes herself as mixed race. She attends
School BB and lives with her father. She speaks both Spanish and English at home.
Her father works in “patent/trademarks” and her mother is a manager. JazzyJay has
many family members who work for the government, including her father, her
grandmother, her aunt, and more than one uncle. She herself has a variety of career
interests, listing in her survey that she would like to be a lawyer and a photographer,
as well as to work in sports medicine.
She owns a cell phone and has more than four computers in her home. She
uses mobile devices to access the Internet, although she does not use tablets. She rates
herself as very good at using the Internet. She has a lengthy process she uses to check
the credibility of online information:
I would open up a whole bunch of windows, like 5 different ones. --- I would
open that, I would read them and I would have Microsoft Word open and type
stuff in that I think are the similarities and differences and what the articles
and whatever one has more similarities, I would probably choose that one.
Compare and contrast. (CS)
When the researcher noted that that was a lot of work, JazzyJay simply replied that
she is “not trying to do that plagiarism all wrong.”
“YOU’RE KIND OF A GOVERNMENT ACTIVIST, AREN’T YOU?”
JazzyJay is passionate in her dislike of the government. She defined the government
in her survey as not caring “about the economy or us and they steal our taxes to give
to other countries.” In answer to whether she agrees or disagrees with the statement
“government really cares what people like my family and me think,” she exclaimed
129

“No they don't! Strongly disagree! A hundred times. A hundred times a hundred” and
asked if she could say “strongly disagree times a hundred” before counting out zeroes
to list on the page. A fellow participant asked at one point “You're kind of a
government activist aren't you?” Her answer was an implicit yes, replying “Even
though my dad works for the government and so does my grandma. And my aunt.
And my uncles” (WA). At one point, JazzyJay noted she believed that the
government’s “whole general thing is to steal our stuff and don't even give a crap
about us.” Her school librarian tried to emphasize that “the government” is not one
person and that this is a system the people voted for and created. JazzyJay responded
that she “didn't vote for it because [she’s] not of age yet” (WAR).
JazzyJay has many reasons she expressed for these strong feelings. She does
not “think they care about our well-being. Because if they did they wouldn’t have
police officers shooting us” (WA). When fellow participants replied that not all police
officers are bad, she argued that “the government's not doing anything about it! You
hear about these policemen raping these girls at a young freakin age. If you listen to
the news…” (WA). Other participants noted that they did not hear of such accounts
Jazzy Jay said that she “listen(s) to the radio and they get away [with] it. They don’t
get in trouble for it” (WA). JazzyJay later said that she wants to be a lawyer to change
such practices. She also listed “killers” in her word association list for government
and explained that she was referring to “how police, like not for racial standpoint, but
how they're killing, but not even giving them a chance to explain themselves and all
that stuff.

130

Some of JazzyJay’s dislike appears to come from a lack of knowledge of the
duties of certain officials. She described President Obama as “a puppet” and
supported the statement with the fact that he doesn’t “even write his own speeches.”
When her school librarian attempted to explain that this is not something for which
any modern president is responsible, she replied:
No but in my opinion - everyone has their own opinion...I think he is a puppet,
because even though you're having the issues, but you say you care about the
people, you should have enough time or something to at least write the
speeches to say to the people, instead of having someone else say their own
opinion…If you really care about the people…then you would take the time to
write your own speeches not have someone else like your secretary or vice
president write their speeches for you (WAR).
She also found fault with social policy, referring negatively to the fact that “we have
all these houses that are empty, there are like 50,000 of them and they're all empty,
but they have high prices, no one can really even buy them…[the] homeless are
actually trying to do something, but you won't give them a house” (WA).
Aside from political issues, when asked what she thinks about when she hears
the word government, JazzyJay replied “false information” (I). She believes strongly
in certain conspiracy theories, including that Area 51 is being used to hide something
from the American public, “Because say if you're trying to search on aliens, but it
takes you to a government site, and they say oh they are not real. But you know they
are real” (WA). She believes that they are real because why else “would [they] have a
full guarded fence around one area?” (WA)
131

JazzyJay’s lack of trust extends to people in general. From her survey
responses, she strongly disagreed with the idea that most people can be trusted. She
also strongly disagreed that people get fair treatment in America, no matter who they
are. Interestingly, she was uncertain about whether elected officials could be trusted
and whether in American, people have an equal chance no matter where they come
from or what race they are.
“I TRUST THE GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES.”
JazzyJay, despite her strong feelings against the government in general, does
demonstrate some trust. She chose dot gov websites (along with dot org and .edu
sites) to recommend “because the websites seem more accurate” (HLAT). She also
described an instance when she “had to do research on one of [her] parents” and that
“since [her] dad's a part of the government, trademark thing,…[she] picked that.”
They went on the website for her father’s job and she said it “showed what his job is
mainly about and all that stuff” (I). She also told a researcher that she “trusts the
government sometimes” (RTON). She noted that they “can give us true and false
information” and that they do probably want Americans to be healthy (unless, of
course, they want to decrease the population) (RTON).
There were also more negative comments she made. For example, she listed in
her word association for dot gov: “People Who Think That They Are In Charge Of
Everything,” “False information that they give,” and “They take our taxes to give
money to other nations,” suggesting that she does indeed link dot gov websites with
her feelings about government. Evidence also suggests that she does not have much
experience with dot gov sites. She did not give a definition or example of a
132

government website on her survey and, when asked who in the government she
thought created alzheimers.gov, she simply replied “an old person” (PS).
J AZZYJ AY’S PERCEPTIONS
Jazzy has a negative perception of both government and e-government. Her dislike of
e-government is strongly connected to her negative perception of government,
including her belief that the government is hiding things from the public and does not
care about its citizens. It is unclear on whether use of government websites would
change her mind or not.

SUMMARY OF CASES
These young people offer both doubt and support for the government. Seeing the
details of their lives, such as their race/ethnicity, parental and familial influences,
strongly held beliefs, and desired futures, adds additional layers to their perceptions
of government and government websites. Far from being apathetic to current events
and controversies, these participants use these to inform their views on civil
institutions. Thus, it is critical to take their views and concerns seriously when
recommending sources of information and helping them to critically examine their
opinions.
It is important to note that these participants were not selected to act as
representatives of their respective perceptions. If anything, these cases demonstrate
how unique each participant’s views and opinions are. From media, to family, to
experience, there are a variety of influences shaping these youths’ views. These

133

influences and the themes that have emerged in both the aggregate view of the data
and in these particular participants will be discussed in the next chapter.

CHAPTER 6: DISCUSSION
Chapters four and five focused on the respondents’ direct discussion of government
and government websites, with the former looking at the study participants in
aggregate and the latter focusing on individual cases. This chapter compares the
findings outlined in previous chapters to prior research, sheds light on the
contributions of the study’s findings to these research areas, and offers
recommendations for both research and practice based upon the implications of what
has been learned.
134

COMPARISONS TO PRIOR RESEARCH
YOUTH PERCEPTIONS OF GOVERNMENT
This study’s participants evaluated the government using many similar measures as
adults have demonstrated in prior studies of trust and government (Hetherington,
1998). While the participants did occasionally evaluate the President and institutions,
opinions most commonly seemed to stem from participants’ views of policies and
from the type of media to which they had been exposed. These particular foci of the
participants seem to connect with prior findings in political socialization research that
current events and periods of society upheaval can influence political development
(Jennings, Stoker, & Bowers, 1999; Sears & Valentino, 1997). The general state of
society was an obvious underlying element to participants’ evaluations. Agent
Chicken Wing (CC-ON), for example, does not like the news because it scares her;
they constantly talk about ISIS - “beheaded this…beheaded that.” Sweet Hershey
Kiss (CC) brought up issues of racial profiling by the police during her interview:
I mean with the Michael Ferguson, with the Michael Brown thing, it's not fair
how they're making assumptions, I mean, I just want everything to come
together as one, not just saying oh the white man was picking on the black
man, or the black boy deserved it, I mean, it's just all about equality and
fairness.
The participants’ general lack of trust also echoes pior research. A recent study using
data from two national studies found that trust “was at an all-time low in 2012 among
12th graders. For example, 32% of 12th graders in 1976–1978 agreed that ‘most
135

people can be trusted,’ but this figure sunk to 18% in 2010–2012” (Twenge,
Campbell, & Carter, 2014, p. 1918). These 12th-graders also showed marked
decreases in confidence in institutions; for example, their opinions on how good of
job large corporations were doing sunk significantly between 2000-2002 and 20102012, from 54% rating them “good” or “very good in the early 2000s,” to 33% just a
decade later. The authors suggest these numbers may be due to economic inequality
or rising crime rates, the latter of which was noted by this study’s participants
obliquely during data collection (e.g. JazzyJay’s comments on the police).
This is not a longitudinal study so we cannot know whether these events – the
terrorism caused by ISIS in the Middle East and the many prominent instances of
police brutality during confrontations with young African-Americans – or this general
distrust will continue to impact the participants over the course of their political lives.
What we can assume is that the events are shaping the way that these youth currently
search for and view information. There may or may not be implications on long-term
behavior, but there are certainly implications on their current information-seeking
actions and attitudes, both issues of direct relevance to educators and policy-makers
attempting to reach young people. Thus, understanding young people’s political
concerns informs how we should approach their development of information, digital,
and civic literacy skills.
YOUTH INFORMATION-S EEKING BEHAVIOR
The aspects of government websites on which participants based their assessments
matched with past research into youth information-seeking behavior. These youth
mentioned such factors as aesthetics (as has also been noted in Agosto, 2002a, 2002b;
136

Fergie et al., 2013; Fidel et al., 1999; Gasser et al., 2012; Sundar, 2008). They also
described government websites positively because of their large amounts of
information (echoing findings of Hirsh, 1999; Agosto, 2002b).
Participants also displayed both facets of source credibility assessment,
institutional and individual. As defined by Rieh and Belkin (1998), these include the
URL and the institution (e.g. a government site) versus the familiarity of the author of
the site and/or the amount of information available about the author. This study’s
participants were far more likely to note the URL or the institution, but some did
mention the expertise of the people writing the content (even though they were
occasionally off-base as to who these people are). Other credibility-related
evaluations were made about the inclusion of certain information on the site, such as
a date, as well as the inclusion of media, such as a YouTube video. The limited
observations available for these participants’ use of e-government revealed more
interest in the use of words associated with the participant’s search terms than in the
source of the information, a finding previously identified by Subramaniam et al.
(2015b). All of these behaviors should be considered when designing government
websites and teaching digital literacy skills.
PARTICIPANT’S PERCEPTIONS OF E-GOVERNMENT
While there is little research available with which to compare this study’s findings on
youth views of e-government, the studies available on adults do share some
similarities with the data. For example, Dimitrova and Chen (2006) surveyed 447
online Americans (in a sample comparable to Pew national telephone survey data)
and found that there was a relationship between perceived usefulness of e137

government and subsequent use of e-government. Similarly, their findings suggested
that “nonadopters generally believe governmental web sites do not offer anything
relevant for them” (p. 185). They also found that security and privacy were concerns
of some respondents. Carter & Bélanger (2005) found that perceived ease of use is a
predictor of future use of e-government services.
Participants in this dissertation demonstrated all of these findings, questioning
the usefulness of government websites for health research, indicating ease of use as a
positive evaluation of government, and mentioning privacy and security when
questioned about their intentions to use government websites (although in the latter
case, most participants found the relative security of government websites as a
positive reason to access the government sites.) The similarities suggest that there
may be opportunities to reach both adults and young people by using the same
strategies of promoting government websites, as well as with similar improvements to
the content, design, and features of online government information.

CONTRIBUTIONS TO RESEARCH
YOUTH INFORMATION BEHAVIOR AND INFORMATION ACCESS
One particularly interesting finding to come out of this study is the fact that so many
of the participants based their evaluations of government and e-government on
policies, whether general or specific. Perhaps more interesting was the importance of
information-related policies; the findings showed clear connections between both
negative and positive perceptions of government and perceptions of information-

138

related policy. Commonly mentioned issues (described in chapter four) included
government surveillance, government secrecy, and the dangers of hacking.
Participants’ negative views of the government’s tendency toward secrecy
were not terribly surprising given prior research; a national survey’s finding that
young people perceive that “Snowden’s revelations served the public interest” is just
one example of this (Levitsky, 2014). What was novel was the fact that many of the
participants cited the security of government websites as a positive association they
had. For example, three of the boys at school AA brought up the Sony hacking case to
positively compare the safety of government websites to the lack of security in
commercial software. This is striking, as research would suggest young people
generally trust corporations’ management of their data (Levitsky, 2014). Batman’s
experience, however, told a different story:
… since I'm a Sony fan and I have a PS3 and a PSVida, I couldn't play online,
so I wanted to play with my friends, and some of my friends at my school, you
know? And…that basically collects in my mind, why would a person do that
and you know they got, even though you're a computer engineer, you don't
have to hack into another person's software. And that's a worldwide company.
It has a whole lot of people.
This suggests that there may be ways to leverage participants’ desire for a safe
environment to search.
Despite the lack of surprise over participants’ wariness of surveillance, and
government secrecy, these issues do represent potential social access barriers to
government information. Of course, potential impacts will likely be incremental, but
139

there is a real possibility that information-related issues could lead to political
alienation if youth choose to avoid online government information rather than risk
negative exposure by accessing websites or other sources.
Also of potential detriment to young people’s access to information are
intellectual barriers they face due to their lack of government and e-government
knowledge. As far as political knowledge goes, these young people most acutely
lacked awareness of the structure of government, particularly with regard to who in
the government is responsible for information dissemination to the public. Generally,
participants were not very aware of government resources online. Common confusion
occurred over the source of content, the variety of content (i.e. whether sites were just
about politics and government or if they also spoke on other topics), and how to
distinguish government resources from other online material. This could reflect the
participants’ lack of knowledge of government in general, as low domain knowledge
has been found to be a barrier to searching online information (Hirsh, 2004). Not
knowing details about the structure of government (e.g. government agency names;
government’s role in funding scientific research and hosting information about such
topics online) is a hindrance to understanding the breadth and usefulness of
government resources. As a particularly striking quote from Dr. Golden Man (BBCS) shows, youth often are not aware of what kind of resources are available from the
government; “I don't really think a government website would be on the Internet.
Because what are they going to do, buy a tank?” While this is an extreme example,
the confusion over the purpose of government websites came up more than once.

140

CONNECTION BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS ’ GOVERNMENT AND E-GOVERNMENT
PERCEPTIONS
In aggregate, the participants’ general opinions of government and their opinions on
government websites differed greatly. While over half of the participants had negative
perceptions of government, this did not translate into an equal number of negative
perceptions of government websites. Interestingly, there were also more neutral views
of government than of government websites, which either may show conflicted
feelings about government or may be a sign that these participants simply are not that
interested in government either way.
This study also shows no clear connection between young people’s
perceptions of government websites and their perceptions of government. While
participants who had positive perceptions of government unanimously had positive
perceptions of government websites, this is not enough to suggest that a connection
between the two exists. Many participants who expressed a negative opinion of
government conversely had a positive view of government websites. This dichotomy,
which echoes the contradictions that individual participants expressed when giving
their opinions of government and government websites, likely reflects the
participants’ gaps in civic and information literacies.
One indication that there may be more to explore in researching the impact of
government opinions on perceptions of government websites are participants’
frequent mentions of the source of the content on government websites as reasons to
both positively and negatively assess online government information. This trend
suggests that there may be more impact than is seen at first glance.
141

Table 6.1 demonstrates the wide range of positive and negative statements
made by participants. The rows for Perception of Government and Perception of EGovernment are color-coded according to dominant position – red for more negative
than positive statements, green for more positive statements than negative, yellow for
neutral (an equal number of positive and negative statements), and purple for not
enough data (no evaluative statements were made by the participant). The participant
column is color-coded only if the government and e-government positions are the
same. In the cases where they differ, the participant cell is left without color. (The
number of statements each participant made regarding government and e-government
including neutral statements is included in chapter three.)

Figure 6.1: Overall Perception of Government and Government Websites
Overall what these data show is that the underlying opinions, influences, knowledge,
and personalities of participants may have more bearing on opinions of both
government and e-government than simply the influence of a perception of one
(government or e-government) on the other.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE
This study has shown that while perceptions of government websites do not seem to
directly influence perceptions of government, perceptions of government may have
144

some effect on participants’ views of government websites. This was seen in
individual statements for the most part, particularly when participants noted the
influence that the source of the government websites had on their evaluation of the
site. What was also clear was the much higher percentage of participants who viewed
e-government favorably than who viewed government positively.
For government officials responsible for disseminating messages to young
people, this has considerable implications. Firstly, officials can leverage young
people’s postive perceptions of government websites. This should be of interest due
to the potential for positive experiences with e-government to lead to “perceptions of
transparency of government, accessibility of government information, and increased
responsiveness of the federal government” (Tolbert & Mossberger, 2006, p. 365).”
Government officials can increase the aspects of their websites that young people
appreciate. Youth believe the websites are easy to use because they do not require the
extensive process of establishing whether the information is true or not that other
websites on the Internet require. By making information easy to find, geared toward
their literacy levels, and applicable to the types of information they are studying in
school and are personally interested in, the government can preserve the positive
opinions of government websites that these young people currently have.
To better direct their websites to youth, the government should examine the
websites that young people are using. In this study, participants seemed to have a
more robust knowledge of web resources targeted specifically to them. For example,
many of the participants in the program had heard of the health website
kidshealth.org, citing their teachers and web searches as ways they found out about
145

the site. Because of its specific focus on young people’s literacy levels and health
interests, it provides a “one-stop-shop” in some respects for general health
information. While the government does have several sub-pages and even some
youth-focused websites, these are often underdeveloped or targeted to very specific
health domains (e.g. the now-defunct “Best Bones Forever” website focused on
young women and bone health). The government’s current policy in shifting away
from agency-produced sites to a more centrally sourced youth e-government strategy
may suggest they are attempting to create broader, youth-focused resources. How this
will be implemented remains to be seen.
To reach youth and encourage additional use of online government resources,
the government may need to do more extensive advertising than simply making the
websites available. One study on e-government found that “mass media channels are
more influential than are interpersonal channels” (Dimitrova and Chen, 2006, p. 185)
when attempting to increase use and knowledge of resources. The participants’
recollections of hearing about healthcare.gov and the campaign by Michelle Obama
to increase youth activity are both indicative of this type of media influence. Creating
interesting and useful government resources and then spreading the message through
the media that youth consume could be powerful motivators for increased use of dot
gov websites by young people.
A second strategy for the government to use to appeal to youth is to focus on
the security of government websites. Government information policy, particularly in
combination with salient current issues, seems to be influencing the way that young
people behave online and with government information in general. The participants’
146

assurance of the relative safety of government websites is a potential boon to officials
who would like to increase the role of government websites in financial and other
sensitive data transfers with the government. By leveraging the beliefs that young
people have of the security of government websites, government agencies can make a
case as to why their sites should be used over others. Of course, this will need to be
backed up by evidence that government websites are, in fact, secure and protected, as
a data leak that actually reaches tweens’ attention could be disastrous for the
credibility they have earned so far.
The government also can address young people’s concerns about government
surveillance by a) explaining what they are actually monitoring and b) addressing
information policies in such a way as to cease invasive intrusions on privacy. Young
people are paying attention to this and it seems it is already having an impact on their
belief in government’s transparency. The statements many participants made about
feeling uncomfortable accessing government sites because use could reveal private
information show clearly the potential ramifications government information policy
may be having on young people’s use of online government resources, as well as their
future interactions with government offline.
For educators, these findings should prompt changes to their own teaching
practices of not only the credibility of government websites, but also about
government information in general. Both the general findings and the case studies
shed light on how an educator can contextualize his or her students’ perceptions of
government in order to best provide instruction on issues of policy and civics,
particularly important when teaching students who may have pre-existing biases and
147

negative opinions. Indeed JazzyJay’s librarian in the HackHealth program
demonstrated a keen awareness of the need for this type of individualized instruction
when she had several conversations with Jazzy about the difference between opinions
and facts, the danger of parroting others’ beliefs without having the knowledge to
back them up, and the benefits of government that Jazzy was ignoring. As she said,
“opinions are like elbows, everyone has them.” This type of critical thinking and
analysis is oftenmissing from a school day organized around tests and other
assessments.
One way to introduce these skills is to tie them to the curriculum. Chapter one
introduced relevant state curriculm standards for social studies by grade. Viewing a
selection of these in the light of the literacy gaps this study demonstrates that youth
have is instructive:
1. Analyze the usefulness of various sources of information used to make
political decisions;
2. Analyze the influence of the media on political life;
3. Examine the impact of governmental decisions on individual rights and
responsibilities in the United States;
4. Analyze how government needs to provide more protection and order during
times of crisis, such as the natural disasters and threats to national security;
5. Analyze a document to determine point of view; Identify bias and prejudice;
Compare information to prior knowledge; Determine the reliability of the
document; Compare ideas, models, systems, and perspectives; Reconstruct the

148

arguments of issues or events; Assess the costs and benefits of alternatives;
Verify or change prior understandings based on new information; and
6. Engage in civic participation and public discourse (Maryland State
Department of Education, 2006)
Having students look at the information used by the government may give them
insight into a) the real-life application of information literacy skills and b) a
greater belief in the transparency of the political process. Learning to critically
examine the media may help them identify their own biases and mitigate the
effect of popular conspiracy theories or misinformation. Considering individual
rights, as well as the benefits and trade-offs of increased protection and security
will help students make educated decisions regarding their beliefs in policies,
information-related and not. Analyzing documents, comparing information, and
changing opinions based on new information are critical information literacy
skills that will also help to teach young people to have open minds and alter past
beliefs if they find them to be false. Finally, engaging in civic discourse teaches
young people about different perspectives and allows them to see their own
fallacies of belief.
In addition to the above recommendations for educators, information
professionals can also use these findings to show the need to create lessons and
projects that connect civics, social studies, and information literacy. The Standards
for the 21st Century Learner, produced by the American Association of School
Librarians in 2009, demonstrate significant overlap with the social studies standards
outlined above. Specific examples include:
149

•

Standard 1.1.5: Evaluate information found in selected sources on the basis
of accuracy, validity, appropriateness for needs, importance, and social and
cultural context;

•

Standard 1.1.7: Make sense of information gathered from diverse sources
by identifying misconceptions, main and supporting ideas, conflicting
information, and point of view or bias; and

•

Standard 3.1.5: Connect learning to community issues.

School librarians also may need to re-examine their tendency to recommend “dot
gov” resources without additional contextual teachings about government information
in general. There were references during the study to participants having heard source
recommendations from teachers, but not understanding the reasons behind them;
Percy Potter (AA-WAT) for example recalled that a statement on sources he had
given to the group was “not [his] personal opinion. It's like teachers and other
people's opinion. Usually teachers say when you're researching don't try to use
Wikipedia as much.” When asked if he knew why not, he replied “no.” Using the
same type of shorthand for government websites might prove especially disappointing
if the participants later find out the connection to government and they choose not to
use the sites because of a pre-existing distrust. Explaining where the information
comes from and what is available will take time and (potentially) additional civic
lessons on the structure of government and the resources it makes available to the
public, but this could have tremendous impact on not only the use of fact-based

150

government websites, but also the students’ ability to reach critical government
resources and aid as they grow older.

SUMMARY
What lies at the core of this study’s findings is the cross-cutting awareness that these
young people have about issues of critical importance to the United States. Whether
they view government responses to these issues positively or negatively (and, as
chapter four showed, there are plenty of examples both ways), youth are tuned into
issues much more than adults may think. Although many of their opinions are based
on fictional accounts or conspiracies, the same could be said for many adults. These
youth are at an age where they can still be taught the value of facts, biases in media,
and other critical information literacy skills. In fact, as shown in this chapter, these
are all included as fundamental skills of the curriculum. Chapter seven offers a
summary of the findings and suggestions for future research into these critical areas
of youth information behavior.

CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION
This concluding chapter first offers a summary of the findings and issues discussed in
chapters four, five, and six. An overview of the limitations of the study follows this
summary. Next, I discuss suggestions for future research. The chapter ends with
concluding statements.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
151

This dissertation began with two goals: 1) To develop an understanding of the
participants’ perceptions of government and e-government and 2) To observe
connections between their perceptions of government and perceptions of egovernment. The importance of these issues is based on:
•

The increasing role of government websites in people’s everyday lives;

•

The potential insight that a study of young adolescents who are just starting to
form abstract beliefs might give to agencies and educators who are attempting
to develop the next civically-engaged generation, and;

•

The distrust of government that recent studies of young people have shown.

The conceptual framework guiding the study was built on prior work in the areas of
information-seeking behavior, credibility assessment, e-government, and trust in
government. Four propositions for this framework were conceived:
1. Access is conceived as physical, intellectual and social (Burnett, Jaeger, &
Thompson, 2008). Each of these levels can create barriers to information
seeking and the fulfillment of information needs;
2. Demographics, experiences, and beliefs influence information-seeking
behavior (Johnson, 2001);
3. An increase in confidence in the government after use of e-government has
been demonstrated, though not with youth (Chee-Week, Bensabat, &
Cenfetelli, 2008; Smith, 2010; Welsh, Hinnant, & Jae Moon, 2005). Thus,
experiences with e-government may affect a user’s perception of government;
and

152

4. E-government is intended to promote democracy and access to government,
thus any barriers to access should be identified and addressed.
These propositions underlie the questions posed to guide the research:
1. What are HackHealth participants’ perceptions of government?
2. What are HackHealth participants’ perceptions of e-government?
To understand HackHealth participants’ perceptions of government, the study first
looked at how they defined government. In their survey definitions, participants
tended to consider the function of what the institution does, including its role in
making laws, assisting Americans, offering protection, safety, and security, acting as
a leader and keeping law and order, and acting as tax-collector. Some participants
offered neutral definitions, but many definitions offered negative or positive
assessments as they characterized their idea of government. These evaluations
continued throughout the other data collection activities. Participants assessed
government through several lenses, most represented in prior studies of how people
form their level of trust in government. These lenses included institutions, the
President, policy, information specifically cited from media, and through non-specific
means. When considering institutions, most participants stuck with more generic
terminology, evaluating the “people” who perform certain functions. Others,
however, did assess elected officials and political parties. Relatively few assessed the
government through their opinions of the President, though there were positive and
negative reactions to Barack Obama. Many of the participants offered more general
evaluations, explaining that they trust in government or that the government is
“mean,” but failed to explain on what they are basing these observations. The media
153

proved to be a powerful lens by which to make evaluations, as a great number of the
negative assessments of government came from conspiracy theories gathered through
both the Internet and TV entertainment. Policy proved to be the most frequently cited
direction of evaluation, with participants both citing general actions taken by the
government in terms of security or monetary policy (for example) and specific
policies, such as the American Care Act and the response of the government to the
Ebola outbreak of 2014. The most frequent policies cited revolved around
government secrecy, government surveillance, and terrorism.
Participants had both negative and positive views of government. Common
themes focused on by those with positive perceptions were economics; equality,
rights, and impartiality; leadership and effectiveness; protection and security;
trustworthiness and fairness; helpfulness, and expertise. Those with negative
perceptions of government used many of the same themes, including economics, a
trustworthiness and impartiality (or a lack thereof), and security, as well as politically
motivated decisions.
Participants’ knowledge of e-government was examined from their survey
answers, as well as the way they conceived government websites throughout the rest
of the data. Half of the participants were unsure about what government websites
were based on their answers (or lack thereof) on the survey. This confusion came up
throughout the program, with participants confusing dot gov sites with dot org URLS,
displaying a lack of knowledge of the connection with the government by their
contradictory opinions on government information in general and government

154

websites, and offering examples of government websites that do not exist, among
others.
Despite these areas of confusion, participants largely had positive perceptions
of government websites. They based their evaluations on such website characteristics
as aesthetics and other surface heuristics, the actual content or message on the
websites, a belief in the dot gov URL, recommendations from teachers, prior
experience with government websites, or, most commonly, the source of the
information (i.e. the government). Common reasons given for positive evaluations
included the amount of information the websites included, how the sites compare to
other websites, the sites’ ease of use, the fact that the websites are safe and secure,
and the trustworthiness or expertise of the government. Those with negative
perceptions also mentioned the government as a reason for their perception,
particularly the lack of trust they felt for government. They also mentioned aspects of
the sites’ aesthetics and content they disliked.
There were implications of these findings to both research and practice. For
research, the study gave insight into the research areas of youth information behavior
and e-government. Participants demonstrated information behaviors studied in prior
research, as well as attitudes toward government and e-government that echoed
previous findings with adults. There did not seem to be a clear connection between
the participants’ perceptions of government and e-government, but there were
connections made in individual statements that suggest the perception of government
might affect the perception of e-government.

155

The overall positive opinions of e-government suggest that it might be
worthwhile for government officials to attempt to direct connections the opposite
way, leveraging positive notions of government websites in order to help form more
positive perceptions of government.This is just one of the practical implications of the
study. For educators and information professionals, the findings suggest a need to
focus on the common standards in social studies, information, and digital literacies to
address young people’s gaps in knowledge of government and e-government, as well
as their developing critical thinking skills. The findings also show the need to provide
context with suggestions of information sources. Overall the study highlights the
importance of perceptions of government and e-government to the access of critical
government information.

LIMITATIONS
METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS
The nature of qualitative research is such that the researcher’s interpretations are
necessarily part of analysis, which carries with it the possibility of bias and
misinterpretation of data. Of particular note is the researcher expectancy effect,
wherein researchers are “more likely to perceive events in the desired direction”
(Krathwohl, 2009, p. 499). They may “inadvertently tip the scales in a variety of ways
– verbally (for example, with encouragement and clues) and nonverbally (smiling for
right answers or frowning for wrong ones)” (Krathwohl, 2009, p. 499). This type of
bias is part of what makes up demand characteristics of a study or “what the
participants perceive the study wants of them” (Krathwohl, 2009, p. 500). As outlined
156

in chapter three, steps have been taken to mitigate these influences, particularly
through external confirmation of coding and the triangulation of data.
In addition, data may be affected by the maturation effect, or the chance that
“between observations, students might have grown older, more tired, bored, capable
of more mature reasoning, or more serious about getting an education, as well as
more biologically and socially advanced” (Krathwohl, 2009, p. 490). The data
collection instruments were administered over a 10-12 week period. During the
sessions, participants learned about credibility and helpful health online resources.
While care was taken to administer the majority of the data collection tools toward
the start of the program, participant observation and tools that were administered after
the first week were all potentially susceptible to changes in the participants’
knowledge and behaviors. In addition, the study suffered from a lack of attrition (the
participants included had differing levels of involvement in the study’s data
instruments based on how many HackHealth sessions they attended).
STUDY POPULATION
A unique aspect of this study population is their geographic proximity to Washington,
DC. This may promote an increased knowledge of government policy and related
issues simply because they have family members or know people who work for the
government. Additionally, this is a relatively small study population that is not
representative. Even with both of these distinctions, however, findings are intended to
invite further research rather than generalize to a larger population.
Selection bias, or “when a factor that determines group membership also
affects the outcome of the treatment,” might have influenced findings (Krathwohl,
157

2009, p. 494). This was mitigated slightly by the fact that participants joined the study
to take part in an after-school program about health, not government, and aside from
their willingness to answer questions for this research, did not express any particular
interest in government or politics.
PERCEPTION VS USE
This study focuses on participants’ perceptions rather than their use of government
websites. There is a definite possibility that even with positive perceptions,
participants may have no intention of using government websites. This is actually
reflected in observations made of the participants’ research during the after-school
program:
ACW (CC) typed in Kawasaki and skimmed down the Google search list. She
said she didn’t like the Mayo Clinic (which was number one) and hovered
around kidshealth.com (she might have actually clicked both of these and then
have gone back to the search page…this all happened pretty fast).
MedlinePlus was on the Google search result list, but she didn’t even glance at
it. ACW ended up on medicinenet.com and at some point clicked the ad for
psoriasis and got confused.
Additionally, the data collection for this study occurred in a school environment.
While participants were asked about their perceptions of these websites for all types
of searches, it is likely many focused on school information given their location.
Everyday life information search is, of course, even more difficult to observe because
of access to participants, but both are certainly limitations of the study’s findings.

158

SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
As mentioned in the limitations section above, the positive perceptions of these youth
do not necessarily indicate that they are using government websites. A study of young
people’s use of government websites is a critical next step in understanding more
about the connection between pre-existing beliefs, social access, and use of
government information. Additionally studies of such a nature would inform our
understanding of the connection between young people’s information literacy skills in
general and their application of these skills.
Another interesting direction of this research is to look more into participants’
parents’ political ideologies. For a variety of reasons (time, IRB approval, etc), this
study focused only on the young people present at the after-school sessions. From
political socialization literature, however, it is clear that parents have a significant
impact on their children’s political beliefs (Youniss, 2002). The influence of parents
might prove to supercede the influence of current events and the media, or it might
prove to simply add to the complex mix of factors that goes into a young person’s
political development. What would be particularly interesting for this research is the
parental view and past use of online government information.
Finally, a deeper look at how a young person’s digital literacy skills interact
with their personal preferences for and biases against sources would shed light into
the interplay between intellectual and social barriers to access. While this study was
able to extrapolate some information about a participant’s digital literacy skills,
further development of a tool like the Health Literacy Assessment Tool, except
159

focused on government information and sources would be an ideal way to gain deeper
understanding of young people’s barriers to government information.

CONCLUDING STATEMENTS
That a group of 10- to 12-year-olds specifically mentioned the fact that a website is
less likely to be hacked as one of its features is mindboggling when we consider how
little anyone thought of these issues a decade ago. Similarly, these participants’ fears
that the government would spy on them if they used government websites is an issue
not often addressed in digital literacy education. On one hand, it is encouraging to
know that these youth are considering information security and privacy issues. On the
other hand, there is no clear sign that these perceptions are precipitating the use of
trustworthy websites. Rather, these issues may be generating a generation of cynics.
This dissertation was intended to learn more about participants’ perceptions of
government and government websites, and possible connections between the two.
Perhaps the most novel finding, however, is the degree to which participants
considered information policy when evaluating government. This study is yet one
more example of the critical role that information plays in the lives of people of all
ages and only emphasizes the need for information professionals to help youth
understand information bias, information policy, and information literacy skills writ
large.

APPENDICES
APPENDIX ONE: RECRUITMENT FLYER
Dear Students (and Parents/Guardians),
Are you interested in science? In learning about health? We are starting a new afterschool program for students like you. We are a team of researchers from the
University of Maryland, and we want to discover the best ways to help kids learn
161

about health sciences and learn about keeping themselves and their families healthy.
We need your help to do this!
We would like to invite you to participate in a free after-school program, which will
begin on [insert program begin date]. We will meet once every week, [insert the day
of the week] from [begin time] to [end time]. The program is twelve weeks long, with
one introductory meeting before the program begins and another meeting for a
celebration and party after the program is over. Each week, we will meet in the
library after school to talk about health information and practice new ways of finding
information online. The final celebration and party will be at the University of
Maryland.
During the program, we’ll ask you to concentrate on one health concern that interests
you. Maybe you like to play football or soccer, but you’re worried about how a
concussion might affect you. Maybe your little sister has asthma, and you want to
learn more about it. Maybe your uncle has high blood pressure – you get the idea.
Everyone could use a little more information about their health!
After the program is over, we will have a final session for celebration and to find out
more about what you thought of the things we accomplished during the project.
Parents, we need you to be present at this final session too. As a way of thanking you
and your child for participating, we will send you a check for $50 to show our
appreciation.
We’ve attached a brief survey to this letter so that we can get in touch with you
before the program begins. If you’re interested in participating, please complete the
form and return it to the school librarian (media specialist) as soon as possible. We
hope to hear from you.
If you have any questions about the program or what we’re trying to accomplish,
we’d be happy to answer them. You can contact ___ at ___ or ___.
Thank you so much! We look forward to meeting you!

168

APPENDIX FIVE: CARD-SORTING
Card-Sorting Exercises

1. Shuffle each deck, so that the cards are in a random order.
2. Working in small groups of 3 to 4 students, go through each of the three decks
asking the students to talk about which source they would be most likely to turn to
if they needed health information. Ask the students to explain the reasons behind
their answers [e.g., Why would they most likely turn to the Internet? Why would
they not ask a family member?]
3. For each deck, ask the students if there are any other sources that we didn’t ask
them about. If so, ask them if they would turn to this source for health information
and why or why not.
4. For each deck, ask whether there are any particular situations in which they would
tend to consult a particular source.
5. Throughout this process, try to probe to get detailed explanations behind the
students’ responses.
