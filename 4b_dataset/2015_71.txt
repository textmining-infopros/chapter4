Chapter I
Introduction
This dissertation explains and describes the qualitative study examining the academic
information search process experience of six undergraduate students enrolled in a remedial
English course as they completed an assigned research paper for the course. The study was
conducted during spring, 2014, at a regional campus of a four-year, state university in Ohio
(hereinafter referred to as MidState University), and study findings informed this researcher’s
creation of a thematic representation of study findings model of the participants’ experience.
Additionally, based on the study’s findings, this researcher puts forth recommendations for
library and information science and remedial education professionals and for targeted
information literacy instruction for undergraduate students similar to study participants in
Chapter 5 of this dissertation.
This researcher used descriptive phenomenological research methods to uncover and
report the universal essence of the academic information search process experience for
participants in the study described throughout this dissertation. Rather than referring to the
entire population of remedial undergraduate students, ‘universal essence’ within the context of
this dissertation refers to the commonalities of the experience for study participants only (please
see the “Definition of terms” table later in this chapter for further explanation). Because there is
minimal published research regarding this process for remedial undergraduate students
specifically in the library and information science literature, this researcher’s study contributes
its findings to this research gap, as the findings have broader implications for future library and
information science research with remedial undergraduate students. Additionally, as shall be
explored in Chapter 5, this study’s findings also have implications for targeted information

2
literacy instruction which may aid this academically at-risk population’s continued persistence in
higher education.
Previous library and information science research indicates that a person’s understanding
and possession of information literacy skills (the ability to “recognize when information is
needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information”
[ALA, 2000]) is innately linked to their ability to create and follow through with a balanced and
appropriate academic information search process (Boon, Johnston, & Webber, 2007).
Additionally, as Salisbury and Karasmanis (2011) assert, this process is “intertwined” (p. 43)
with learning in general. Therefore, this researcher engaged in the study described within this
dissertation on the premise that examining the academic information search process (hereinafter
referred to as ‘AISP’ for purposes of brevity) experience for undergraduate students enrolled in a
remedial English course would allow her to create a thematic representation of study findings
model of the participants’ experience.
Consequently, this model of the participants’ experience builds a foundation for future
research into the broader information behaviors and experiences of undergraduate students
enrolled in remedial coursework (also referred to in the literature as ‘developmental
coursework’—Brothen & Wambach, 2004; Buglear, 2009; Di Tommaso, 2012; Fields &
Holland, 1998; Mulvey, 2009; Parker, 2012). This researcher would like to note at this juncture
that the terms ‘remedial’ and ‘developmental’ are often used interchangeably in the literature on
the topic, and when the term ‘developmental’ is included within this dissertation, it is done so
based on the term used by the author or authors of the specific research being cited. A specific
definition of a remedial undergraduate student is included in the “Definition of terms” table
presented later in this chapter.

3
Based on the universal essence of the experience of study participants featured in the
findings-based model (please see Chapter 4), this researcher discusses possible implications of
study findings for library and information science and remedial education professionals and for
targeted information literacy instruction in Chapter 5. This discussion provides a basis for future
research in this area, and for all those seeking ways to develop more effective instructional
methods which will aid remedial undergraduate student persistence toward graduation.
This researcher puts forth that findings from this study highlight the need for a broader
conversation regarding the library and information science field’s professional understanding of
the information behaviors of remedial undergraduate students, as well as the importance of
further, collaborative research into the information and education needs of this academically atrisk student population. Further rationale for conducting this study is presented throughout the
rest of this chapter.
Background of the problem
In a four-year national study conducted by Project Information Literacy (2012),
researchers surveyed more than 11,000 students at approximately 50 higher education
institutions in the United States to understand how these students described their information
search processes for both academic and personal information needs. Approximately 84% of the
study’s participants stated “getting started” was the most difficult part of research, and used the
following 12 adjectives frequently to describe how they feel about research assignments: “fear,
angst, tired, dread, excited, anxious, annoyed, stressed, disgusted, intrigued, confused, and
overwhelmed” (Project Information Literacy, 2012). Moreover, in a recent study conducted on
how college freshmen conduct course research during their first year as undergraduate students,
Head (2013) discovered that “[freshmen] struggle with reading and comprehending scholarly

4
materials once they are able to find them and have trouble figuring out faculty expectations for
course research assignments” (p. 1).
Such findings point toward the presence of information anxiety in first-year
undergraduate students. Information anxiety, defined in this dissertation as the combination of
anxieties or uncertainties felt by students when using the library and/or information technologies
to find information to meet an information need (as discussed in Blundell & Lambert, 2014;
Jerabek, Meyer & Kordinak, 2001; Nicholas, Huntington, Jamali, Rowlands & Fieldhouse, 2009;
O’Brien & Symons, 2007; Onwuegbuzie, Jiao & Bostick, 2004; Prabha, Connaway, Olszewski
& Jenkins, 2007; and Van Kampen, 2004), is something library and information science
researchers believe has a decidedly negative impact on students’ academic success when
elevated, particularly in regard to their information literacy skills. Linking this concept to the
general background of the problem being addressed in his dissertation, even less is known about
the impact of information anxiety on remedial undergraduate students, and how this affects their
academic information search processes and overall information literacy abilities. Information
anxiety in academia will be addressed more broadly in Chapter 2—however, it is worth
mentioning here that information anxiety of a sort does play a role in the AISP experience of this
researcher’s study participants, and therefore the inclusion of this concept within the broader
discussion in this dissertation is a crucial aspect of understanding the totality of the AISP
experience studied and described within this dissertation.
Although the impact of anxiety and a lack of information literacy skills in undergraduate
student information behavior is not a new topic in the library and information science literature,
more specifically the literature which examines the Millennial student information search
process in higher education (Becker, 2003; Nicholas et al., 2009; Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004;

5
Prabha et al., 2007; Robinson & Reid, 2007; Taylor, 2012; Timmers & Glas, 2010), what is a
vastly underexplored research area is the impact of all these facets on undergraduate students
enrolled in remedial coursework. Based on current statistics indicating increasing remedial
education enrollment and ever-decreasing degree attainment for same (explained in more detail
below), this researcher believed this gap in the scientific literature in library and information
science could no longer be ignored, and sought to create a foundation for broader research in this
area through the qualitative study described within this dissertation.
In a 2012 report of the current state of remedial education in the United States, Parker
(2012) shares that approximately one in four students (or, 25% of incoming students) seeking a
bachelor’s degree from a state university require remedial education before beginning their
college-level coursework. Other researchers in this area estimate those requiring remediation in
four-year institutions may be as high as 30% (Bailey, Jaggars, & Scott-Clayton, 2013; Bettinger
& Long, 2005; Roselle, 2009), and as high as 79% in two-year institutions (Bailey et al., 2013;
Buglear, 2009; Di Tommaso, 2012; Hamilton, 2013; Mulvey, 2009; Roselle, 2009). Parker
(2012) says of those testing into remedial coursework at a state university, only around 32% of
these students will achieve a bachelor’s degree in six years or less—compared to the 58% sixyear completion rate of those who do not need remedial coursework.
As the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) findings reported by Sparks and
Malkus (2013) bear out, the rate of students whose college placement test scores have placed
them directly into remedial education was approximately 20% of all incoming students in 200304,and in 2007-08 (based on statistics reported through NCES from years 2003-04, and 200708). This indicates a five to 10% increase between Sparks and Malkus’ (2013) report of figures
from 2007-08, and figures reported by Parker (2012) from 2012. Despite varying claims of the

6
success of remedial education for students completing these courses before moving onto collegelevel coursework (as studies cited in Bailey et al., 2013, and Bettinger & Long, 2005, put forth),
it is becoming readily apparent to many working on the front lines of remedial education in
higher education that “the nation’s remedial education system is broken” (Mangan, 2012).
When it comes to remedial English and writing courses, some researchers believe that
libraries and library instructors can play a pivotal role in helping students in these courses
succeed (Badke, 2011; Boon, Johnston & Webber, 2007; Gullikson, 2006; Lascar, 2002; Latham
& Gross, 2011; Lee, 2012; Roselle, 2009; Tierney & Garcia, 2011). However, the impediment
to such interaction sometimes comes not from students but from course instructors, particularly
in faculty attitudes toward collaborative library instruction and involvement in these courses. As
Lee (2012) explains in his study of levels of library anxiety in undergraduate students enrolled in
a remedial English course, “library knowledge was primarily affected by the behaviors and
attitudes of classroom instructors” (p. 67), adding that those student study participants who
reported little to no library exposure or bibliographic instruction in their remedial courses also
reported the highest levels of library anxiety. More on faculty perception barriers to
collaboration will be discussed in Chapter 2.
Low exposure to specific information literacy instruction and other academic
impediments (e.g. information anxiety) can only harm undergraduate students in terms of
essential information literacy skill development, particularly remedial undergraduate students.
As Roselle (2009) discovered in her study of library and library instructor involvement in
developmental education programs, “[a]pplying sound pedagogy, librarians teach basic library
skills in developmental education and academic success courses so that students have the
fundamental knowledge and skills to do college-level work” (p. 154). Badke (2011) adds that

7
“faculty members themselves, rather than just librarians, need to revamp what they do to make
information literacy more than what it now is” (p. 51). Finally, as Freeman and Lynd-Balta
(2010) assert:
It is imperative that faculty of all disciplines introduce students to effective
strategies to filter and analyze information and then provide them with
increasingly complex tasks that are discipline-relevant to cultivate critical thinkers
and the skill set necessary for lifelong learning. This effort should involve
interactions with librarians and occur early and throughout the undergraduate
curriculum (p. 114).
In personal experience working with remedial English instructors as an information
literacy instructor and based on accounts from others with similar interactions, this researcher
has seen first-hand that collaborative faculty-librarian instruction in introductory courses
generally, and in remedial English courses specifically, can make a positive difference in
students’ attainment of information literacy skills. Specifically, this researcher witnessed that
collaborative instruction often increases remedial undergraduate students’ observed information
literacy abilities and overall success in remedial courses, based on instructor reports comparing
involvement to non-involvement. More on this will be discussed in the next section.
Statement of the problem
As stated earlier, this researcher puts forth that there is an inherent lack of research in
library and information science which addresses the information needs and anxieties expressed
specifically by undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework, particularly in regard to
these students’ AISP experience. Further, there is little research examining the AISP experience
of these students as they engage in information-seeking tasks to meet a specific academic need,

8
such as the completion of an assigned research paper. With such limited understanding in this
area, researchers and information literacy instructors alike are at a disadvantage when addressing
the information needs of remedial undergraduate students at present. Therefore, research which
highlights the AISP needs of these students specifically is imperative for those creating
instruction guiding this process. It is this problem which this researcher investigated in her
study, and one which she intends to continue researching after completing her Ph.D. studies.
Although current research in the area of library instruction and/or involvement in
remedial English coursework is limited, the few studies that have been conducted (Boon,
Johnston & Webber, 2007; Lascar, 2002; Latham & Gross, 2011; Lee, 2012; Roselle, 2009)
show that this involvement often makes a significant difference in students’ overall college-level
course readiness after completing remedial coursework. However, these studies have largely
focused on librarian-assessment of general information-seeking skills pre-and-post library
instruction intervention, with limited understanding of the entirety of a student’s experience in
these courses or, in particular, how students perform in academic information-seeking tasks
when completing an assignment such as a research paper. If library assistance and instruction is
to be more effective for students in remedial coursework, this researcher asserts that a
fundamental understanding of all the elements involved in the remedial course experience is
crucial, as evidenced by the study explained and described herein. Particularly, researchers like
Becker (2003), Gross and Latham (2011; 2011; 2009; 2007), Holman (2013), Nicholas et al.
(2009), Prabha et al. (2007), Taylor (2012), and Warwick et al. (2009) have discovered that how
students seek information on their own to meet the needs of academic assignments differs
substantially from the type of academic information-seeking educators and librarians believe
these students are and should be performing in a higher education environment.

9
Turning to research that examines information-seeking as a process in general, seminal
researchers of information-seeking and information behavior have explored the different ways
and means people seek information, and why, from a number of perspectives (Bates, 2005;
Belkin, 1980; Dervin, 1999, 1998; Erdelez, 1997; Jiao, Onwuegbuzie, & Lichtenstein, 1996;
Kuhlthau, 1991; Savolainen, 1993; Taylor, 2012; Taylor, 1991; Williamson, 2005; Wilson, 1983;
1977; Wilson, 1999). For the purposes of this dissertation, the information search process is
defined as the physical, mental, and emotional processes in which one engages when seeking
information to fulfill an identified information need (variations on this concept, such as
‘academic information search process,’ ‘information-seeking behavior,’ etc. are described in the
“Definition of terms” table in this chapter). This definition is consistent with a similar and
widely accepted definition developed by educator Carol Kuhlthau (1991), in regard to her
creation of a model of the information search process from the user’s perspective, and affirmed
by other seminal researchers in the field (as described in the meta-analysis of information
search/behavior models conducted by Wilson, 1999, and in Taylor, 1991).
One thing that appears to be fairly consistent in research findings, as discussed briefly
earlier in this chapter, is that undergraduate students experience a great deal of information
anxiety during the information search process to meet an identified information need (Gross &
Latham, 2009; Gross & Latham, 2007; Head & Eisenberg, 2010; Holman, 2011; Jerabek et al.,
2001; Van Kampen, 2004) (please see “Definition of terms” for a description of this concept).
However, very few of these studies explain broadly why students believe they experience such
high levels of information anxiety, or how they believe this anxiety impacts them during their
information search process primarily, and in regard to their academic performance overall.
Without a deeper and more complex understanding of how or why information anxiety has such

10
negative effects on student academic information-seeking, any attempt to limit such anxiety
during a college-ready undergraduate student’s information search process will be challenging—
and may be almost impossible when it comes to limiting this same anxiety in remedial
undergraduate students. The difference between college-ready and remedial undergraduate
students is outlined more completely in the “Definition of terms” table.
In addition to a lack of understanding regarding the information search process for
undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework as a whole, there is also a gap in the
literature that addresses specifically similarities and differences in this process between remedial
undergraduate students, and their college-ready undergraduate student counterparts. However,
this dissertation study did not gather data from both college-ready undergraduate students and
undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework. Such analysis may be best performed
after collecting data through a large-scale, quantitative study and because this dissertation
focused on deeper understanding of the remedial undergraduate student AISP experience, such
comparison was deemed inappropriate for this study. However, this researcher supports that the
qualitative data she gathered and analyzed from her research participants on the entirety of their
AISP experience, and the thematic representation of study findings model of the participants’
experience presented and explained in Chapter 4, contributes critical research to the previously
identified gap in this area in the library and information science literature.
Purpose of the study
The purpose of this dissertation study was to examine how participants in the study (i.e.
undergraduate students enrolled in a remedial English course) explained and described their
AISP experience conducted to find information to complete a course-required research
assignment. The experience was examined from a number of perspectives via a triangulation of

11
data collection methods, recommended by some qualitative researchers as a means to increase
the trustworthiness of qualitative study findings (Hatch, 2002; Merriam, 2002; Schram, 2003).
Study findings were then used to create a thematic representation of study findings model of the
participants’ experience (as is appropriate with descriptive phenomenological studies—Colaizzi,
1973; Giorgi, 2009; Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007) so that such findings might
inform future research in this area, as well as provide a research context for those interested in
the creation of targeted information literacy instruction that more broadly meet the specific needs
of similar student populations (as shall be discussed more broadly in Chapter 5). Please see the
“Definition of terms” table for more detailed descriptions of phenomenology in general and
descriptive phenomenology in particular, and distinctions between the two.
Descriptive phenomenological study, which focuses on the universal essence of an
experience itself (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Dowling, 2007; Giorgi, 2009; Shosha, 2012; Spinelli,
2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007), is based on data gathered from a number of perspectives
(including from the experience’s participants themselves). Therefore, this methodology was
deemed to be an appropriate qualitative approach for the study because of this researcher’s focus
on the AISP experience, and not on the AISP ‘experiencers,’ per se. Although some descriptive
phenomenological research does use only the participants’ recounting of their experience as the
study’s primary data, other descriptive phenomenological research examines the experience from
numerous data sources (including artifacts, protocol writing, and participant observation—
Colaizzi, 2973, Giorgi, 2009; Hatch, 2002; Merriam, 2002; Moustakas, 1994;). Triangulation of
data sources was used in the study described herein to obtain as rich and robust a set of
information about the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate students as possible, as well as
to increase the trustworthiness of study findings (as explained earlier in this chapter). These

12
sources include one-on-one interviews with participants, observations of in-class and in-lab
activities while engaged in the AISP experience, and the participants’ final assignments. More
on descriptive phenomenology, justification for its use as this dissertation study’s methodology,
and broader detail on the study’s data collection methods are provided in Chapter 3. Although
all efforts were made by this researcher to include both traditional and non-traditional
undergraduate student participants in the study (distinctions described in the “Definition of
terms” table), the study included only traditional undergraduate students as neither of the two
non-traditional students in the class elected to participate. Therefore, study finding-driven
implications for targeted information literacy instruction explained in Chapter 5 theoretically
extend only to traditional undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework. Future
research will endeavor to include the non-traditional undergraduate student perspective in this
area, as well.
Research question
It was deemed appropriate early in the study to use a research question as a basis for the
research itself because inductive qualitative study allows findings to emerge from collected data,
rather than making assumptions about findings before collection begins, as might be the case
with formulating hypotheses for a quantitative study (Hatch, 2002; Schram, 2003).
It was the aim of this dissertation study to answer the following research question
regarding the AISP experience of undergraduate students enrolled in a remedial English Course
at MidState University:
RQ: How do the study’s participants (traditional undergraduate students enrolled in a
remedial English class) explain and describe their academic information search process
(AISP) experience:

13
a) During the process, and
b) Once the process has concluded and the final product (i.e. the research
assignment) has been submitted for a grade?
The answer to this question is detailed in Chapter 4, and is based on the analysis of the
collected study data explained and in part presented as a thematic representation of study
findings model of the participants’ AISP experience, and expounded upon in the appropriate
descriptive phenomenological fashion, as detailed in Chapter 3.
Importance of the study
As has been put forth previously, research examining the academic progress of
undergraduate students enrolled in remedial courses indicates that these students are more at-risk
than their peers in terms of academic persistence and institutional retention in higher education
(Bettinger & Long, 2005; Fields & Holland, 1998; Sparks & Malkus, 2013; Parker, 2012;
Roselle, 2009). The appropriate and/or effective academic information search process (or AISP)
of undergraduate students has been linked to the notion of strong and academically sound
information literacy skills and understanding in the literature (Becker, 2003; Boon et al., 2007;
Gross & Latham, 2011; 2009; 2007; Gross, 2005; Nicholas et al., 2009; O’Brien et al., 2007;
Prabha et al., 2007). Additionally, strong information literacy skills have been identified as
fundamental components of students’ continued academic success in higher education (ALA,
2000; Breivik & Gee, 2006; Budd, 2008; Head, 2013; Project Information Literacy, 2012; Soria,
Fransen, & Nackerud, 2013). Therefore, understanding the AISP experience in context and from
multiple perspectives, including from the perspective of undergraduate students enrolled in a
remedial English course at MidState University, increases the discourse in this under-researched

14
area and creates a foundation for future research into the specific information needs and
behaviors similar populations in higher education in the United States as a whole.
This researcher affirms that this study has greatly informed her own understanding of the
AISP experience for remedial undergraduate students, and therefore supports that her findings
may be similarly informative for remedial education instructors and information literacy
instruction librarians. It is this researcher’s informed opinion that study findings described in
detail in Chapter 4 and the implications of same for both library and information science and
remedial education professionals presented in Chapter 5 may facilitate the creation of
information literacy instruction that more effectively targets the academic information needs of
remedial students enrolled in undergraduate coursework.
Scope of the study
As stated earlier in this chapter, although it was the goal of this researcher to secure both
traditional and non-traditional participants within the study, this was not the case, and therefore
this study’s scope is limited to traditional students. Research indicates there are fundamental
differences across the educational spectrum between traditional and non-traditional students, and
to be able to compare those differences on some level would have been a great boon for this
researcher’s study (as will be discussed briefly in “Limitations” in Chapter 3). However, that the
participants of this study represented traditional students only does not detract from the
importance of the data gathered in terms of the phenomenon under investigation (i.e. the AISP
experience of remedial undergraduate students). Future research in this area will endeavor to
secure greater numbers of participants, as is described in Chapter 5. Additionally, although
every effort was made to recruit all participants in the class to participate, only six chose to do
so. More on the demographics of participants shall be discussed in “Data sources” in Chapter 3.

15
Finally, this researcher would like to reiterate that this study was limited to investigating
the AISP experience of participants from a qualitative perspective. Therefore, findings reported
in Chapters 4 and 5 conform to qualitative reporting norms, as discussed in Colaizzi (1978;
1973), Giorgi (2009; 1997), Hatch (2002), and Merriam (2002).
Definition of terms
The following table provides definitions for terms used within this dissertation and how
this researcher defines these terms within the context of her study.
Table 1
Definition of terms
Academic information

The physical, mental, and emotional processes in which one

search process

engages when seeking information to fulfill requirements for an
academic assignment, e.g. an assigned research paper (Dervin,
1999; 1998; 1983; Kuhlthau, 1991; Project Information
Literacy, 2012; Taylor, 1991; Wilson, 1999). Kuhlthau (1991)
refers to an information search process thusly: “physical, actual
actions taken; affective, feelings experienced; and cognitive,
thoughts concerning both process and content” (p. 362).
Therefore, it is put forth herein that this definition relates to the
AISP definition provided above, and can be further defined in
this study to explain the physical as being keywords and
information research databases/resources used, the mental
(cognitive) as being the thoughts concerning the AISP and the
content returned during the AISP experience, and the emotional
(affective) as the range of thoughts and feelings experienced by
research participants during the AISP experience.

Critical thinking

This researcher defaults to the definition of critical thinking
provided by Dewey (1933) in How we think, which he puts

16
forth is emblematic of the concept of ‘reflective thought:’
“Active, persistent and careful consideration of a belief or
supposed form of knowledge in light of the grounds that
support it, and the further conclusions to which it tends” (p. 6).
College-ready

Students whose college entrance/placement scores indicate they

undergraduate

are academically prepared for college-level work and therefore

students

require no remediation/developmental coursework before
enrolling in college courses (Bettinger & Long, 2005; Brothen
& Wambach, 2004; Buglear, 2009; Conley, 2008; Hamilton,
2013; Hoyt, 1999; Ishitani, 2006; Mangan, 2012; Mulvey,
2009; Parker, 2012; Roselle, 2009).

Identified

Similar to ideas discussed in work by Dervin (1999; 1998;

information need

1983), Kuhlthau (1991) and Wilson (1999), an identified
information need is defined within this dissertation as a mental
catalyst that spurs a search for information. Specifically, its
identification typically sets off “a state or process started when
one perceives that there is a gap between the information and
knowledge available to solve a problem and the actual solution
of the problem” (Miranda & Tarapanoff, 2008).

Information anxiety

The combination of anxieties or uncertainty felt by students
when using the library and/or information technologies to find
information to meet a need (Fry, 2009; Gross, 2005; Lee, 2012;
Onwuegbuzie, Jiao & Bostick, 2004; Prabha, Connaway,
Olszewski, & Jenkins, 2007; Roselle, 2009).

Information behavior

“An information-seeking activity, the causes and consequences
of that activity, or the relationships among (table continues)
stages in information-seeking behavior” (Wilson, 1999, p. 250).

17
Information literacy

The ability to “recognize when information is needed and have
the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed
information” (ACRL, 2000).

Information literacy

Typically delivered by librarians, information literacy

instruction

instruction (or ILI) promotes the use and implementation of
information literacy via instructional methods. Such instruction
can occur in collaboration with a course instructor, or it can be
delivered by one or more librarians during a class period or
online, without instructor assistance. ILI can include
instructional modules on navigating library resources and tools
(like academic research databases), and often incorporates
hands-on exercises to reinforce session objectives (Booth,
2011; Budd, 2009; Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009; Johnson,
Lindsay, & Walter, 2008; Kasowitz-Scheer & Pasqualoni,
2002; Kvenild & Calkins, 2011; McAdoo, 2012; Ren, 2000).
Library instruction as a whole is defined later in this table.

Information need

A need that arises when a person identifies a gap in his or her
knowledge (Belkin, 1980; Dervin, 1999), and seeks to fill that
gap either because it stimulates curiosity, conflict, or concern
(Wilson, 1983, 1977; Williamson, in Fisher et al., 2005).
Needs may be partially or fully formulated at the original
identification of the need (Bates, 1989; Dervin, 1999; Nicholas
et al., 2008; Wilson, 1999) and may change slightly or
significantly as the person engages in information-seeking to
fulfill his or her need (Bates, 1989; Dervin, 1999; Williamson,
Wilson, 1983, 1977).

Information search process

The physical, mental, and emotional processes in which one
engages when seeking information to fulfill an information

18
need (Dervin, 1999; Kuhlthau, 1991; Taylor, 1991; Wilson,
1999).
Information-seeking

Perhaps best described by Wilson (2000) (cited in Boon,

behavior

Johnston, & Webber, 2007), information-seeking behavior is
“the purposive seeking for information as a consequence of a
need to satisfy some goal” (p. 207).

Library anxiety

The range of anxieties (fear, nervousness, confusion, etc.)
experienced when attempting to identify, define, and satisfy an
information need, through use of the library and/or its resources
(such as reference services) to satisfy that need (Gross et al.,
2009; Gross et al., 2007; Kwon et al., 2007; Onwuegbuzie, Jiao
& Bostick, 2009; Van Kampen, 2004).

Library instruction

Formerly referred to as ‘bibliographic instruction’ (Ellis &
Whatley, 2008), library instruction typically refers to
instruction delivered at least in part by a librarian or
information professional in a number of areas. Basic library
instruction typically includes teaching library users how to
navigate the library itself (including physical and digital
resources), and more advanced library instruction focuses on
multi-faceted topics like information literacy development.
Herein, library instruction refers to that instruction delivered by
a librarian or information professional to undergraduate
students enrolled in remedial coursework in the area of library
navigation and information search process development.

Non-traditional

Those students entering higher education at the age of 24 or

undergraduate students

older, who may also have one or more of the following
considerations: minority race status, non-campus residence,

19
part- or full-time employment level, and enrolled in a nondegree occupational program (NCES, 2013).
Phenomenography

Phenomenography, although sometimes viewed as fitting
within the philosophy of the phenomenological concept
(Andretta, 2007), differs from phenomenology as a research
paradigm in that it focuses on the variations of an experience
expressed by study participants (Marton & Booth, 1997, in
Andretta, 2007), as opposed to the common facets or universal
essences of an experience focused on in phenomenological
research (see below for a further description of
phenomenology). Additionally, phenomenographic research
also focuses on “the relationship between the subject and the
phenomenon of interest” (Gross & Latham, 2011, p. 165),
setting it apart from the phenomenological focus on the
experience itself as primary outcome of the analysis of data in a
study. As stated by Boon, Johnston, and Webber (2007),
“[p]henomenography can be differentiated from
phenomenology in that the former concentrates on discovering
the subject’s experience of the phenomenon and the latter
concentrates on discovering the essence of the phenomenon
itself” (p. 209).

Phenomenology

Founded in the Husserlian tradition of ‘phenomenology as

(descriptive)

philosophy’ (as explained in Giorgi, 2009, and Wojnar &
Swanson, 2007), descriptive phenomenology “calls for
exploration of phenomena through direct interaction between
the researcher and the objects of study … it calls upon
investigators to set aside preconceptions through the procedures
involved in bracketing … The lived experience itself, as
described by participants, is used to provide universal
description of the phenomenon” (Wojnar & Swanson, 2007, p.

20
174). Further, descriptive phenomenology studies provide a
universal representation of phenomena (as opposed to
contextual representations, as may be the case with interpretive
phenomenological study—Wojnar et al., 2007), and findings
seek to illuminate gaps in previous research on phenomena by
“present[ing] a theoretical model representing the essential
structures of phenomenon under study” (Wojnar et al., 2007, p.
177), which Wojnar et al. (2007) explain is methodology’s
goal.
Phenomenology (general)

Phenomenology as a methodology uses research methods such
as interviews, participant observation (examination of and
discussion with study participants while they are involved in
the ‘experience’), protocol writing (self-reported writing or
journaling by study participants), artifact analysis (examination
of products germane to the experience under investigation, such
as the research assignments of study participants in the case of
this study), and bracketing (a reflexive process wherein the
researcher constantly documents his or her
perceptions/opinions/bias, etc. throughout the process so as to
remove his or her ‘voice’ from the experience that shall be
reported—Hatch, 2002; Schram, 2003) in order to get to the
essence/s of the experience being examined, toward obtaining a
more holistic view or understanding of the experience itself
(Giorgi, 2009; Hatch, 2002; Moustakas, 1994; van Manen,
1990). Because the focus of phenomenological research is on
the experience itself, and most particularly, the commonalities
found in the experience as expressed by study participants, it is
a less ‘social’ form of qualitative research than methodologies
such as case study analysis or narrative analysis (Moustakas,
1994). Key strengths of phenomenological research are rich,

21
deep understanding of the experience under investigation
because of the multiple methods used to gather data on that
experience, and the narrow focus on the understanding of a
lived experience as the primary outcome of the research (Hatch,
2002; Merriam, 2002; Schram, 2003; Moustakas, 1994; van
Manen, 1990).
Satisficing

“Satisficing” was defined by Simon in 1955 as “an information
competency whereby individuals assess how much information
is good enough to satisfy their information need” (cited in
Prabha et al., 2007, p. 27).

Traditional undergraduate

Those students enrolling in higher education immediately after

students

high school and attending the chosen higher education
institution with a ‘full time’ course load (NCES, 2013).

Undergraduate students

Students whose college entrance/placement scores indicate they

enrolled in remedial

are academically un/underprepared for college-level work and

coursework (i.e. remedial

therefore require remediation/developmental coursework

undergraduate students,

(traditionally in math, writing, English, or other subjects as

also referred to as

determined) before enrolling in the college-level courses of

‘developmental’ students in

these subjects (Bettinger & Long, 2005; Brothen & Wambach,

some literature on the

2004; Buglear, 2009; Conley, 2008; Di Tommaso, 2012; Fields

topic)

& Holland, 1998; Hamilton, 2013; Hoyt, 1999; Ishitani, 2006;
Mangan, 2012; Mulvey, 2009; Parker, 2012; Roselle, 2009).

Universal essence

The universal essence of a descriptive phenomenological
experience describes the “common features of any lived
experience” (Wojnar & Swanson, 2007, p. 174). This concept
stems from the phenomenological work of forefather Husserl
(as described in Wojnar & Swanson, 2007), who “referred to
these features as universal essences or eidetic structures”

22
(p. 174) that he “considered … to represent the true nature of
the phenomenon under investigation” (p. 174). The concept of
the universal essence or essences of an experience are also
described in work by Colaizzi (1978; 1973), Giorgi (2009;
1997), and Spinelli (2005). Within this dissertation, universal
essence is used to describe elements common to or
representative of the experience for the majority of study
participants. Therefore, ‘universal essence’ as it is used within
this dissertation pertains only to the ‘universe’ of the study, and
not to the broader AISP experience of remedial undergraduate
students at large.

Organization of the remainder of this dissertation
This dissertation continues in Chapter 2 with a thorough and constructively critical
review of the relevant literature regarding general information-seeking behaviors and the AISP
of undergraduate students. This review begins with a summation of seminal research in the area
of information-seeking and behavior at the undergraduate level, moving into a discussion on
literature examining academic information-seeking processes and behaviors specifically, and
then into an exploration of literature examining information literacy and information-seeking
within the context of other variables relevant to the concept within higher education (i.e. best
practices in information literacy instruction, faculty-library instructor collaboration in regard to
information literacy, and the pedagogical intersect of information literacy instruction and critical
thinking instruction). The review of related literature concludes with a presentation of the
academic theories and models which provided the conceptual framework for this dissertation
study and the theoretical model of the AISP of the Millennial undergraduate student, created by
this researcher as a high-level summary of current research on the topic.

23
Chapter 3 describes the qualitative paradigm in general and the specific qualitative
research methodology used for this study (i.e. descriptive phenomenology). It then discusses the
challenges of such research, the researcher’s role and ethical considerations within the research
field and during data analysis, the nature of study participants, the data collection and analysis
procedures used in the study, verification of data processes, and limitations of the study.
Chapter 4 introduces, outlines, and describes the qualitative data collection processes
used in this study and the particular descriptive phenomenological method used to analyze study
data. It also includes primary and secondary research findings from this study and the exhaustive
description of the AISP experience of study participants, constituting the response to the research
question introduced in Chapter 1 and reiterated in Chapter 3. Also included in Chapter 4 are the
thematic representation of study findings model of the participants’ experience, and a discussion
comparing the thematic representation model to the theoretical model in Chapter 2 and other
relevant literature presented throughout this dissertation. The chapter concludes with a
discussion of findings, a reflection on non-universal study findings, a brief overview of
trustworthiness in the study, and a relation of study findings to Chapter 2’s conceptual
framework of theories and models guiding the study.
Chapter 5 presents a summary of study findings and this researcher’s conclusions
regarding what is now known about the experience investigated and how it will impact her
research agenda moving forward. The implications of these findings to practitioners and to
targeted information literacy instruction is also discussed, as well as recommendations made for
future research suggested by study findings. Final thoughts conclude the chapter.

24
Chapter II
Review of Related Literature
As was outlined in Chapter 1, this dissertation sought to create a research foundation for
addressing the gap in the library and information science literature related to the academic
information-seeking behavior of undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework. Stated
previously, it is reasserted here that there exists very little published research that looks
specifically at remedial undergraduate student experiences with information-seeking and
information behavior in general, or that explores information literacy challenges faced by these
students. Until more is known about the information ‘misbehaviors’ of these students, this
researcher puts forth that both library and information science and remedial education
professionals will be limited in their ability to create effective instruction that assists these
students with their academic progress. The implications of this study’s findings for these
professionals and for the targeted information literacy instruction are discussed in Chapter 5.
The literature reviewed in this chapter explores what is currently available in the area of
academic information-seeking for undergraduate students, and a variety of current approaches to
information literacy instruction in higher education. As current research with college-ready
undergraduate students puts forth, academically appropriate information behaviors and the
possession of implementable information literacy skills and abilities are crucial elements in the
educational development of students, and are therefore pivotal in aiding these students persist
through their academic experiences and become lifelong learners (Badke, 2011; Bruce, 2004;
Fitzgerald, 2004; Freeman & Lynd-Balta, 2010; Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009; Hardesty, 2007;
Harley, 2001; Mittermeyer, 2005; Salisbury & Karasmanis, 2011). As asserted previously,
understanding more about these experiences from the remedial undergraduate student

25
perspective is necessary if educational initiatives and associated instruction are to be developed
that target these students directly.
Because remedial undergraduate students are more at-risk than college-ready
undergraduate students in terms of persistence toward graduation (Bettinger & Long, 2005;
Conley, 2008; Fields & Holland, 1998; Hoyt, 1999; Ishitani, 2006; Mangan, 2012; Merisotis &
Phipps, 2000; Mulvey, 2009; Noble & Sawyer, 2013; Parker, 2012; Roselle, 2009; Tierney &
Garcia, 2011; Sparks & Malkus, 2013; Stuart, 2009), it behooves all those who work with
undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework to find ways and means to help those
students to succeed, both in their remedial coursework and in their academic experiences as a
whole. It is the hope of this researcher that establishing the research ‘conversation’ on the
academic information search process (AISP) experience of remedial undergraduate students
through the study findings presented in this dissertation will create a foundation for further
investigation into the specific educational needs of remedial undergraduate students, giving both
library and information science and remedial education professionals the tools to address specific
concerns of these students and empower them to persist to graduation.
In creating a review of the related literature before beginning research into the academic
information search process (AISP) experience of remedial undergraduate students (detailed
further in Chapter 3), the following sections are included herein: 1) Information-seeking and the
information search process in higher education, 2) Information literacy and the undergraduate
student information search process, and 3) Conceptual framework: Theories and models guiding
the study. This chapter also includes a theoretical model of the AISP of the Millennial
undergraduate student, created as a summative analysis of current relevant models in this area,
and toward creating a bracketed, reflexive model for this researcher in accordance with research

26
protocols necessary for a descriptive phenomenological investigation into the AISP experience
of study participants (defined in Chapter 3). As shall also be explained in Chapter 3, such
reflexive activities are crucial in descriptive phenomenological research (See “Definition of
Terms” and Chapter 3 for an in-depth explanation of descriptive phenomenological research) so
that the researcher does not unduly ‘color’ the research field with pre-conceived biases related to
the experience under investigation.
Literature informing the creation of the model described above and which framed this
researcher’s descriptive phenomenological study is reviewed next.
Information-seeking and the information search process in higher education
This researcher would be remiss in beginning the discussion on information-seeking from
the undergraduate student perspective without first examining the impact of seminal research
into information-seeking from the user’s perspective conducted by researchers in the library and
information science field. Therefore the first part of this section will look to these researchers’
work and discuss their findings in light of the discoveries they made which shaped consequent
research into information-seeking from the undergraduate student’s perspective.
Seminal research into information-seeking from the user’s perspective
As the dearth of scholarly literature on the topic shows, understanding informationseeking from the user’s perspective has been of particular interest to both library and information
science professionals and educators for many years. Although earlier studies in this area sought
to analyze information-seeking quantitatively (as related by Wilson [2010] in his 50-year
summary of information behavior research), in the 1970s and 1980s researchers began
incorporating qualitative methodology into information-seeking studies to learn more about the
‘why’ of information-seeking from the user’s perspective (Wilson, 2010), including research

27
done by Belkin (2000; 1980), Dervin (1999; 1998; 1983), Kuhlthau (1991; 1987), Savolainen
(1993), P. Wilson (1983; 1977), and T.D. Wilson (1999). Although numerous groups (from
children, to public library users, to the elderly) were the focus of many information-seeking
studies during this time, of particular interest to this researcher were those studies focusing
specifically on the information-seeking behaviors of undergraduate students and similar
populations, and these shall be the primary studies discussed within this section.
When one considers foundational studies which assist library and information science
professionals in understanding more about the information-seeking behaviors of undergraduate
students, the conversation quickly turns to three researchers in this field, and their theories and
models of such behavior: Belkin (2000; 1980), Dervin (1999; 1998; 1983), and Kuhlthau (1991;
1987). Of particular interest to this researcher for the purposes of this study was the work done
by these three researchers that led to the creation of conceptual theories and models explaining
information-seeking behavior from a number of perspectives. Belkin’s (2000; 1980) research
investigated the intersect between information retrieval (IR) systems and information users, and
the impediments users encountered when attempting to use IR systems to find information for asyet formulated information needs. Belkin (1980) dubbed this unformulated information need the
“anomalous state of knowledge,” (p. 135), which he also refers to as the ASK (1980), and
explained that when users attempt to find information to meet an ASK from an IR system, they
often encounter frustration, confusion, and a low return rate of information appropriate to
helping them further formulate their information needs. As Belkin (1980) explains, “[t]he
success of the communication [with the IR system] is dependent upon the extent to which the
anomaly can be appropriately resolved on the basis of the information provided. Thus, the
system is also controlled by the recipient and is, in general, iterative” (p. 135).

28
Verbalizing the crux of the issue that soon became the focus of much informationseeking research, Belkin (1980) suggested that IR systems were only as useful as the information
users provided to the system when seeking to resolve an ASK. If these systems were confusing
to use, or hindered the user’s progress when seeking to turn an ASK into a formulated
information need, frustration and continued ASK status would result. This concept is discussed
in great detail in Blair’s (1990) work detailing how and when users reach a point of futility when
searching for information in complex IR systems—more on the influence of Blair’s (1990) work
shall be discussed toward the end of this chapter. Belkin (1980) suggested that future IR systems
should be more user-friendly in their design, helping reduce uncertainty and anxiety in
information-seeking for users, one of the first researchers to indicate that a change from systemcentered design to user-centered design was a critical component in better addressing user
information needs in their interactions with IR systems (Wilson, 2010).
Within the same time period, researchers Dervin (1983, and with Nilan in 1986) and
Kuhlthau (1991; 1987) were also investigating the role that uncertainty and anxiety played in a
user’s search for information, and indeed, how these emotional factors affected a user’s
identification of an information need from the very beginning. For Dervin (1999; 1998), who
along with colleagues created sense-making theory in the early 1980s (Dervin, 1999; 1998;
Savolainen, 1993), the goal of the theoretical application of sense-making was to understand
more about human communication as a whole. Dervin (1999; 1998) saw information needs and
seeking as natural elements in the human communication process, and developed her sensemaking theory within the communication field to better understand its impact on the field of
communication studies. Although her sense-making process was meant to ‘improve’
communication tools such as interviews and the like, the foundational concepts of the model

29
representing sense-making theory, simplified in her Dervin’s (1999) later work as “time, space,
movement, gap: step-taking, situation, bridge, outcome” (p. 39), were of great interest to
researchers in many fields, and particularly in library and information science. That sensemaking included considerations for user’s ecological states and backgrounds when approaching a
search for information, and that she discussed at length the role uncertainty and anxiety plays in
a sense-making endeavor, helped researchers move into a user-focused paradigm when
investigating information-seeking behaviors (Savolainen, 1993; Wilson, 2010).
In concluding the section examining seminal research into information-seeking from the
user’s perspective, last but not least the discussion turns to the work in this area done by
Kuhlthau (1991; 1987). For many educators and library and information science professionals
examining the information-seeking of undergraduate students specifically, Kuhlthau’s
Information Search Process (ISP) theory and model was instrumental in aiding their
understanding and addressing of undergraduate student information-seeking needs. In addition
to her explanation of the steps often encountered by students in a search for information—
“initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation” (Kuhlthau, 1991, p.
367), Kuhlthau (1991) included within each of these stages her perspective on user’s thoughts
(cognitive aspects), the actions and tasks of users (physical aspects), and their feelings (affective
aspects), including the role that anxiety and uncertainty played on the search process as users
moved through the stages (Kuhlthau, 1991, p. 367).
Most usefully, Kuhlthau (1991) also identified that
a) students encountered the most anxiety related to their information search
process at the beginning of an information search process, particularly when it

30
came to identifying and defining an information need, and therefore it was at this
stage users needed the most assistance,
b) the fourth step, formulation, was perhaps the hardest step for students to reach,
stating that for students at the third ‘exploration’ stage, “an inability to express
precisely what information is needed makes communication between the user and
the system awkward” (p. 366), and further, that “[u]sers may find the situation
quite discouraging and threatening, causing a sense of personal inadequacy as
well as frustration with the system. Some actually may be inclined to abandon the
search altogether at this stage” (pp. 366-7), and, most critically for the time,
c) an information search process is dynamic and not linear as Kuhlthau [1990]
explains is suggested by Taylor’s 1986 model, which claimed that a user’s
information need moves through four stages (visceral, conscious, formal, and
compromised) in a linear fashion as information was found to meet the need
(Kuhlthau, 1991, pp. 368-9).
Understanding where and how uncertainty and anxiety impact information-seeking, and
specifically, what happens when uncertainty and anxiety become too great for students to handle
in a search for information, was instrumental in affecting change in the way students were aided
in their information-seeking from a practical level, and in the way 21st century researchers
addressed information-seeking studies. Noteworthy findings of some of these studies and what
they contribute to the conception of the AISP experience of the Millennial undergraduate student
shall be discussed in the next section.

31
Information-seeking and the academic information search process of undergraduates
Twenty-first century research into the AISP experience of undergraduate students is
plentiful in library and information science literature, stemming from the earlier studies of
researchers such as Belkin (1980), Dervin (1983), and Kuhlthau (1991; 1987), to current studies
representative of the experience by library and information science researchers like Gross and
Latham (2011; 2009; 2007) Head and Eisenberg (2010), Holman (2011), Timmers and Glas
(2010), and Warwick, Rimmer, Blandford, Gow, and Buchanan (2009). Although much of the
literature discusses research undertaken regarding in-situ case study investigations (exampled by
Becker, 2003; Bowler, 2010; Jones, 2009; Holman, 2011; Maybee, 2007; and Vakkari, 2005), or
expounds on the outcomes of evidence-based practice into differing information search process
educational initiatives (such as studies done by Hayes-Bohanan & Spievak, 2008; Kalbach,
2006; Larkin & Pines, 2004; Limberg, 2000; Medeiros, 2009; Shanahan, 2009; 2008; and Taylor,
2012), a great deal has been learned about the particular needs of undergraduate student
information-seeking from these investigations and has led to broader, more in-depth studies
regarding the information-seeking behaviors of undergraduate students (Cole, Cantero, & Unger,
2000; Lee, 2008; Metzger, Flanagin, & Zwarun, 2003; O’Brien & Symons, 2007; Salisbury &
Karasmanis, 2011; Vechtomova & Zhang, 2009).
It is to specific research projects that this researcher now turns in addressing the range of
research examining the information-seeking behaviors of undergraduate students, as well
exploring key take-aways from these studies and how they frame this researcher’s understanding
of these behaviors pre-data collection for the specific study proposed in this dissertation.
In analyzing quantitative research performed in the field of the information search
process of undergraduate students, it appears that much of this research was undertaken in
controlled situations or settings (Cole, Cantero, & Unger, 2000; Holman, 2011; Lee & Tsai,

32
2011; Lim, 2009; Nicholas et al., 2009; Ren, 2000; Shanahan, 2009; Shanahan, 2008; Taylor,
2012; Timmers & Glas, 2010; Vechtmova & Zhang, 2009), where information search processes
were simulated and then performed as a part of an experiment, rather than observing the
information search process from a more natural perspective. Some noteworthy exceptions
include studies performed by Head (2013; 2012), Head & Eisenberg (2010), and Warwick,
Rimmer, Blandford, Gow, & Buchanan (2009), who instead studied the information search
process from a number of naturally occurring perspectives and over a period of time (particularly
Warwick et al.’s [2009] longitudinal study on the development of AISP skills and behaviors of
undergraduate students).
In exploring qualitative studies in the area of information search processes and behavior
of undergraduate students (such as those in Andretta, 2007; Boon et al., 2007; Gullikson, 2006;
Larkin & Pines, 2004; Lupton, 2009; Maybee, 2007; and Rieh, 2004), this researcher discovered
rich and in-depth analysis of the how and why of information-seeking of undergraduate students,
particularly information-seeking conducted to meet specific academic needs. In terms of the
information search process experience itself, there are a number of phenomenographical studies
(see “Definition of Terms” in Chapter 1 for a description of phenomenography) which explore
and present a range of participant perspectives on the nature of and approach to an information
search process, as opposed to providing overarching themes uncovered during the research about
information search processes themselves (Andretta, 2007; Boon et al., 2007; Gross et al., 2011;
2011; 2009; 2007; Limberg, 2000; and Maybee, 2007).
Adding to the literature on the information search process experience presented here is
the literature which explores the impact of high levels of information anxiety on undergraduate
student information-seeking behaviors. As discussed in Chapter 1, some researchers in the

33
library and information science field believe that many of the poor information behaviors
exhibited by students are linked inherently to high levels of information anxiety. As information
anxiety can be a substantial hindrance to an undergraduate student’s academic research pursuits,
it is being recognized by higher education professionals as a major factor limiting students’
research abilities and progress through their degree programs (Fry, 2009; Gross, 2005; Lee,
2012; Onwuegbuzie, Jiao & Bostick, 2004; Prabha, Connaway, Olszewski, & Jenkins, 2007;
Roselle, 2009).
Although Mellon began research into ‘library anxiety’ in the mid-1980s (as discussed in
Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004), a scale for measuring library anxiety in undergraduate students was
not developed until 1992. In their book discussing the genesis of the library anxiety scale,
Onwuegbuzie et al. (2004) state co-author Bostick wanted to develop a scale that looked
specifically at the library anxiety of undergraduates from first year to postgraduate work, because
she assumed that “library anxiety is not limited to first-time users but is consistent across the
continuum of learning in a university setting” (p. 2). Furthermore, Onwuegbuzie et al. (2004)
state that “[b]ecause the library is a dynamic institution continuously updating and changing
systems, adding new technologies, and becoming more diverse, … even students who have been
enrolled without interruption can experience anxiety when confronted with these changes” (p. 2).
Despite the recent research which shows that continually changing technological
advances in academic libraries have increased student anxiety in information-seeking (Head,
2013; Jerabek et al., 2001; Kwon et al., 2007; Nicholas et al., 2009; Onwuegbuzie et al, 2004;
Prabha et al., 2007; Vitasari et al., 2010), the concept of anxiety itself in information-seeking and
the limitations it has on academic progress is not new. Researchers such as Belkin (1980),
Dervin (1999, 1998), Erdelez (1997), Jiao, Onwuegbuzie, & Lichtenstein (1996), Kuhlthau

34
(1991), Savolainen (1993), Taylor (2012), Taylor (1991), Wilson (1983; 1977), and Wilson
(1999) have expounded upon this concept at length. However, those working within the field are
concerned that anxiety in information-seeking may not be the only problem affecting
information-seeking proficiency in undergraduate students. Indeed, Blundell and Lambert
(2014), in a quantitative study exploring first-year undergraduate student responses to
information anxiety elements, discovered that approximately 67% of respondents in the study
either agreed or strongly agreed that they did not want to learn how to do their own research.
Therefore low motivation of students to learn how to do research is worthy of further
investigation, although this researcher surmises that low motivation is linked to high information
anxiety in students, reiterating the need for researchers to understand more about specific
elements behind poor information-seeking behaviors.
To that end, and critical to this dissertation study, this researcher did not find a true
phenomenological study on the information search process experience of undergraduate students,
particularly those undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework. The study as
described throughout this dissertation therefore provides a more in-depth and complex image of
the AISP experience for undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework, toward
furthering research in this area. As Williamson (2005) shares in her research, no information
search is approached without a complex array of background factors influencing the searcher in
the ways he or she searches for information. Additionally, because of phenomenology’s focus
on the universal essence of a lived experience (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997;
Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007), and not on the diverse range of perspectives of an
experience expressed by participants in a study as occurs in phenomenographical research (see
“Definition of terms” in Chapter 1 for a more complete definition), this researcher was able to

35
investigate more broadly the ecological factors which influenced the participants’ experience
itself. Supporting the use of phenomenology as a means to study the information-seeking
experience of undergraduate students; Budd (2009), quoting Elmborg (2006, p. 194), writes:
By objectifying and decontextualizing phenomena in the search for broad
structural patterns, information literacy researchers have separated students from
social and economic contexts, thereby detaching them from school, teacher, and
society in an effort to isolate variables to create more pure ‘scientific’ studies.
(p. 23).
Indeed, this researcher asserts that it is crucial for 21st century library and information
science researchers and instructors to appreciate the entirety of a student’s academic information
search process experience if they are to assist these students in contextually relevant and
meaningful, successful ways. As Grassian and Kaplowitz (2009) state so poignantly in their
expansive guide on information literacy instruction and initiatives, “[p]eople learn when it is
meaningful for them to do so” (p. 10).
In summarizing key take-aways from the studies analyzed in pursuit of understanding
more about information-seeking and the information search process of undergraduate students,
one finds a number of commonalities. These include:
1.

Students, regardless of the information need, typically and overwhelmingly turn
to the Internet and family, friends, and peers as primary information sources when
information-seeking, without much thought given to the authority, credibility, or
reliability of these information sources (Becker, 2003; Gross & Latham, 2011;
2007; Head, 2013; Holman, 2011; Massimini & Peterson, 2009; Nicholas et al.,

36
2009; O’Brien & Symons, 2007; Prabha et al., 2007; Robinson, & Reid, 2007;
Shanahan, 2009; 2008; Taylor, 2012; Warwick et al., 2009);
2.

Despite exposure to instruction in terms of best practices when seeking academic
information, students have low motivation to change their current, poorly
structured search strategies (mostly developed during their high school years),
choosing instead to ‘update’ their current strategies rather than seek out new and
more effective strategies to finding information, most often because of previous
success they have experienced with the poorer strategies (Becker, 2003; Gross &
Latham, 2011; 2011; Holman, 2011; O’Brien et al., 2007; Prabha et al., 2007;
Taylor, 2012; Thelwall, 2005; Vakkari, 2005; Vechtomova & Zhang, 2009;
Warwick et al, 2009);

3.

Students often ‘satisfice’ (see “Definition of terms” in Chapter 1) their
information-seeking for academic purposes, finding resources that meet minimal
requirements for assignments because of anxiety and uncertainty in informationseeking for academic purposes, and because they encounter difficulty when trying
to understand content presented in academic resources (such as in scholarly
journal articles). Consequently, many students turn to less-reliable sources such
as Wikipedia and ‘trusted’ web resources for information, even though most
acknowledge these resources are insufficient and academically inappropriate for
meeting the requirements of academic assignments (Badke, 2011; Cole et al.,
2000; Deitering & Jameson, 2008; Hsieh, Dawson, & Carlin, 2013; Johnson,
Lindsay, & Walter, 2008; Mittermeyer, 2005; Taylor, 2012; Warwick et al., 2009;
Weiner, 2011),

37
And finally,
4.

Academically appropriate information-seeking is tied directly to the information
literacy abilities of students—therefore, the less information literate students are,
the more difficulty they will encounter when developing academically appropriate
information-seeking behaviors, despite believing their behaviors to be sufficient
and their information behaviors to be above average. This is perhaps best
summed up by Gross & Latham (2011):
While below-proficient [in terms of information-seeking abilities and behaviors]
students also buy into the idea that information seeking is something anyone can
do and have a high degree of self-confidence in their information skills, they tend
to rate their own ability as above average … The idea that an objective set of
skills for information is possible surprised some students. In line with the
perception that finding information is about product, not process.
(Gross & Latham, 2011, pp. 172-3).

The words quoted above from Gross and Latham (2011) are particularly poignant for this
researcher. Indeed, it is surmised that such problems extend even deeper for undergraduate
students enrolled in remedial coursework, who face a range of academic challenges that their
college-ready peers do not. Therefore, and as supported by the study findings presented in
Chapter 4, this study revealed that remedial undergraduate students have additional, unique sets
of anxiety-inducing problems and challenges in terms of information-seeking behaviors. Current
research into the information anxiety of undergraduate students in general is presented next.
As summation of the literature cited in this section, this researcher has shown that
research in library and information science has revealed that many undergraduate students have

38
poor academic information-seeking skills and therefore continually exhibit poor academic
information behaviors. Additionally, many of these same students fail to recognize the poor
quality of these behaviors, choosing instead to amend deficient academic information-seeking
behaviors rather than adopting new, academically appropriate ones. Similarly, many students in
the studies cited above exhibit satisficing behaviors in their academic information-seeking to
meet minimum assignment requirements, and believe these behaviors to be sufficient for their
academic progress. Finally, it is apparent that many students focus not on their information
search process, but rather, the products of that process as being emblematic of the ‘success’ of
their information behaviors. These elements produce a troublesome cocktail for all those
working in education and library and information science to promote efficient, academically
sound information literacy skills and thorough academic information-seeking processes.
However, that there are researchers in education and library and information science who
acknowledge how detrimental these beliefs are to the academic progress of undergraduate
students as a whole is encouraging. These professionals are attempting to remedy student
misconceptions regarding the AISP through information literacy instruction, both in and out of
the classroom, believing (as does this researcher) that strong academic information-seeking
processes are linked to strong information literacy abilities. The literature on information
literacy instruction initiatives in higher education intent on improving the general information
behaviors of students shall be discussed next.
Information literacy and the undergraduate student information search process
Because of the impact of the Information Age (a.k.a. the Knowledge Era) on higher
education, starting in the 1980s and growing increasingly more pressing as Internet usage
became commonplace, many higher education institutions were required by accreditation

39
agencies to implement strategic academic responses to meet the needs of the 21st century
workforce. This included creating initiatives that promoted the development of information
literacy and critical thinking abilities in the student body, thereby instilling characteristics in
these students required for lifelong learning—characteristics in high demand in the information
economy (American Library Association, 2000; Oakleaf, 2010; Saunders, 2007). As Oakleaf
(2010) and Saunders (2007) discuss, academic libraries more than ever were charged with
proving their ‘worth’ in higher education institutions across the country. Particularly, academic
librarians were tasked with aiding educators imbue the characteristics of lifelong learning in all
students moving through these institutions, and in helping institutions as a whole staunch their
‘student attrition bleed,’ as it were (Oakleaf, 2010; Saunders, 2007). The numerous ways
librarians and educators have chosen to guide the implementation of information literacy
instruction programs in higher education is discussed in the next section.
Information literacy instruction in higher education: Is there one ‘best practice?’
In preparation for the dissertation phase, this researcher spent the last three years
monitoring discussions on the information literacy instruction listserv of the American Library
Association (ili-l@ala.org). Specifically, discussions related to information literacy instruction
were followed in order to ascertain whether a consensus would emerge regarding what
constitutes ‘best practices’ to improve the academic information-seeking behaviors of
undergraduate students. The short answer to the consensus question is that there appears to be
no consensus in this matter. Indeed, over the monitoring period it appeared that there was much
discussion arguing for the merits of a variety of instructional types in this field. This included
discussions on a) one-shot library instruction sessions, typically administered to incoming
freshmen during orientation programs, and that attempt to instill the value of the academic

40
library for these students in ‘one shot’ 45-60 minute-long sessions), b) embedded librarianship,
where librarians “work closely over extended periods of time with non-librarian groups, whether
by joining a semester-long course, maintaining an ongoing presence in online courses,
participating in broad curriculum planning efforts, or joining the staffs of academic departments,
clinical settings, or performing groups” (Kvenild and Calkins, 2011, p. vii), c) collaborative
partnerships between librarians and faculty in a number of unique endeavors (such as those
discussed in Alfino, Pajer, Pierce, & O’Brien Jenks, 2008; Cole, Cantero & Ungar, 2000;
Deitering & Jameson, 2008; Dewey, 2001; Hoffman & LaBonte, 2012; Johnson, Lindsay, &
Walter, 2008; McAdoo, 2010; Nutefall & Ryder, 2010; Rockman, 2004; Smith & Dailey, 2013;
and Young & Harmony, 1999), and d) the integration of library services into auxiliary campus
support services, such as writing centers, testing and tutoring centers, supplementary instruction
programs, and in first-year orientation programs (similar to programs discussed by Breivik &
Gee, 2006; Fitzgerald, 2004; Hardesty, 2007; Lupton, 2008; and Malone & Videon, 2003).
In addition to a range of discussions on the ALA listserv regarding what constitutes the
‘best’ type of information literacy instruction in higher education is an equally lengthy debate on
who exactly should be providing information literacy instruction to students. Although some on
the listserv maintained that information literacy instruction is and should remain the domain of
librarians, others contributing to these discussions believed it should occur through collaborative
partnerships. Perspectives on collaboration included suggestions for collaboration between
librarians and faculty members (but that librarians should take the lead), or between librarians
and student support services (described above). Interestingly for this researcher, a strong opinion
on the matter of instruction emerged from the library and information science professionals who
promote the powers of technological advancement. Many of these professionals shared that they

41
believe information literacy instruction should be delivered through self-guided, online tutorials
made available to students, from which they could learn at their leisure (ALA-ILI listserv, email
communication, January, 2012 to January, 2015).
Turning to the literature that addresses information literacy instruction in higher
education, there appears to be no more consensus on information literacy instruction best
practices within the numerous works on the topic than there was in the listserv discussions (a
brief sample of which appears here: Badke, 2011; Burkhardt, MacDonald, & Rathemacher, 2005;
Elmborg, 2003; Freeman & Lynd-Balta, 2010; Gross & Latham, 2011; 2009; 2007; Hardesty,
2007; Jacobson & Xu, 2004; Smith & Dailey, 2013; and Young & Harmony, 1999). However,
despite a lack of consistency in listserv discussions and published works on the topic of
information literacy instruction, a strong voice in support of collaborative, contextual
information literacy instruction is emerging. More on the specific literature related to
collaboration in information literacy instruction shall be discussed in the next section.
Views on collaboration in information literacy instruction
As was stated previously, there are a growing number of library and information
professionals conducting research into the benefits of collaborative partnerships in information
literacy instruction in higher education. Numerous advocates for such efforts include librarians
like Badke (2011), who contends that “those who know and care about information literacy need
to become mentors to faculty members who care about student research” (p. 53). Breivik and
Gee (2006), in discussing the importance of institutional support for collaborative partnerships
between librarians and the entire higher education institution, state: “[t]he challenge is for
institutions to ensure an integrated approach that fosters active learning by students and offers
incentives and opportunities through faculty development programs for faculty to become more

42
active facilitators of learning” (p. 48). Johnston and Webber (2003), in a meta-analysis of
current initiatives in higher education institutions in the United States, the United Kingdom, and
Australia, found that the most effective information literacy programs (in terms of achieving
student learning outcomes related to information literacy) were those initiatives that were a
seamless part of the higher education structure. As they explain, the effectiveness of these
initiatives stemmed from their responsiveness to the needs of the world outside of academia:
The development of the information society and the knowledge economy is
causing fundamental change in the nature of organisations [sic], and this includes
universities. It is not enough … for the university simply to concentrate on
teaching students to be information literate. We contend that in order to realise
[sic] fully the value of this [integrated information literacy] approach as a sensible
curricular response to the information society and the knowledge economy,
universities need to reappraise their own structures and reprioritise [sic] activity
accordingly. (Johnston & Webber, 2003, p. 349).
Finally, in support of collaborative and institutionally supported information literacy
instruction programs, Bruce (2004) states:
Information literacy education is not possible without partnerships. Students,
information specialists, IT specialists, curriculum designers, community
organizations, teachers, amongst others, all need an awareness of the value of
information literacy, and all need to collaborate to make possible learning
experiences that facilitate information literacy (p. 16).
Despite numerous reports of successful collaborative projects between librarians and
faculty, institutional organizations, first-year programs, support services, and the like (including

43
those reported in Freeman & Lynd-Balta, 2010; Hoffman & LaBonte, 2012; Hoyer, 2011; Hsieh,
Dawson, & Carlin, 2013; Kasowitz-Scheer & Pasqualoni, 2002; Kvenild & Calkins, 2011; Lee &
Tsai, 2011; Mackey & Jacobson, 2010; Moser, Heisel, Jacob, & McNeill, 2011; Nichols, 2009;
and Nims, Baier, Bullard, & Owen, 2003), there are still those in academia who resist such
collaborations for a variety of reasons.
Gullikson (2006) discovered that although most faculty from a variety of disciplines
interviewed for the study agreed that the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education (ALA, 2000) are very important for students in terms of academic progress, they
tended to disagree on who was responsible for helping students achieve these standards. Indeed,
many faculty members in the study expected students to enter higher education with most of the
standards already learned, or believed students would attain them quickly during their first year
of study. In applying these sentiments outward, Gullikson (2006) speculates this could cause
problems for librarians who wish to collaborate on information literacy instruction with faculty
members because disagreement over who should teach the standards could cause friction and
misunderstanding between faculty and librarians. In a qualitative investigation of
multidisciplinary faculty members’ perceptions of information literacy instruction and student
learning, McGuinness (2006) found that many faculty members believed collaboration with
librarians in information literacy instruction was unnecessary because they were ‘already
teaching’ information literacy in their courses, or they believed that a) students already knew all
that they needed to know about information literacy or, if they didn’t, b) they would be driven to
learn the necessary information literacy skills on their own:
One of the more striking themes to emerge [from faculty interviews] was the
pervasiveness of the belief that the extent to which students develop as

44
information literate individuals depends almost entirely on personal interest,
individual motivation and innate ability, rather than on the quality and format of
the available instructional opportunities. (McGuinness, 2006, p. 577)
As Gross and Latham’s (2011; 2011; 2009, 2007) research has found repeatedly, not only
are most students ill-aware of their actual academic information-seeking and information literacy
abilities, but many students with below-proficient skills also rate their information literacy skills
as being above average. Therefore, these students do not seek ways to improve their academic
information-seeking behaviors or attempt to acquire appropriate information literacy skills.
Toward educating faculty on this matter, Weiler (2004) states that faculty members who believe
that students are ‘information literate’ upon their entry into higher education (like the faculty
interviewed in the McGuinness (2006) study) are woefully mistaken:
It cannot be expected that all students will arrive at college ready to seek
information with high levels of reflective and critical thinking. Some students
will develop these skills later than others, and some will still be struggling with
them in graduate school. Instructors and librarians would be well advised to keep
in mind that cognitive ability is a developmental process and students must go
through a series of steps over a period of time before they are able to seek
information critically and reflectively. (Weiler, 2004, p. 52)
Adding to findings already presented here, Albitz (2007) puts forth that in terms of failed
opportunities for collaboration, “[l]ibrarians are frustrated that they are not invited into the
classroom to teach “information literacy” skills, and teaching faculty are suspicious of librarian’s
motives for wanting to take over valuable class time” (p. 98), leading to confusion and
miscommunication from both camps regarding the benefits of collaborative information literacy

45
instruction. Finally, as Breivik and Gee (2006) discuss, research indicating a direct correlation
exists between high levels of library use and research skills, and increased academic performance
and retention for students, dates back as far as 1972 to a study at Brooklyn College. However,
collaborative partnerships between librarians and faculty are rarely supported or rewarded at the
administrative level. With the competing work demands of both librarians and faculty, then,
expending extra effort and energy on innovative, collaborative endeavors in information literacy
instruction that may not even be recognized or supported by the institution for which they are
created may hardly seem worth it to many would-be collaborators.
So it appears that information professionals seeking to create an institution-wide support
system for effective information literacy programs are facing a double threat: 1) A lack of
support for the role of academic libraries as a whole by administrators, and 2) a lack of
awareness of the role that collaborative information literacy instruction can play in the classroom
by faculty members. Therefore, in returning to the ‘calls to action’ detailed in the report by
Oakleaf (2010), this researcher puts forth that academic librarians must do more to promote their
institutional value, particularly in terms of information literacy instruction and initiatives, to
higher education as a whole.
A positive means for promoting the institutional value of academic libraries is by
addressing the specific information needs of remedial undergraduate students (which, as this
researcher has already stated, is an under-researched area in library and information science).
Nationwide, almost a quarter of incoming undergraduate students test into remedial coursework
(Bettinger & Long, 2005; Parker, 2012; Sparks & Malkus, 2013). In Ohio, percentages of
undergraduate students enrolled in remedial English courses range from 19% (under the age of
20) to 24% (aged 20 and older) (Ohio Board of Regents, 2011). Problematically, researchers in

46
library and information science who are examining issues faced by remedial undergraduate
students allege scant evidence is provided indicating that these courses help students succeed
academically, or persist toward graduation in a timely fashion (Bettinger & Long, 2005;
Hamilton, 2013; Mangan, 2012; Parker, 2012; Roselle, 2009; Sparks & Malkus, 2013).
This researcher asserts that academic librarians have a unique opportunity to affirm their
institutional value by partnering with remedial instructors toward creating contextual,
collaborative information literacy instruction in remedial courses that addresses directly the
needs of these students. As has already been indicated, Breivik and Gee (2006) suggest that
research on direct, positive correlations between information literacy instruction and student
academic success and retention abound. If academic librarians can create successful partnerships
in remedial courses that help these most at-risk students succeed academically and persist toward
graduation, it is possible that institutional support for campus-wide collaborative initiatives will
soon follow. For this reason and for the many other reasons shared throughout this dissertation;
this researcher asserts study findings presented in this dissertation will provide academic
librarians who are eager to collaborate with remedial instructors crucial ‘bargaining chips’ for
doing so, toward better serving the needs of remedial students, specifically.
Presently, research on the information behavior and information literacy needs of
remedial undergraduate students is minimal, constituting only a handful of studies by researchers
such as Hamilton, 2013; Ishitani, 2006; Lascar, 2002; Lee, 2012; Merisotis & Phipps, 2000;
Mittermeyer, 2005; Noble & Sawyer, 2013; Mulvey, 2009; Roselle, 2009; Stuart, 2009; and
Vance, Kirk, & Gardner, 2012. Therefore, this researcher asserts that her in-depth examination
of the AISP experience of students enrolled in a remedial English course, the findings of which
are described and applied in Chapters 4 and 5 of this dissertation, will provide a foundation for

47
further, more directed research in this area. As she intends to pursue this research further (please
see Chapter 5 for more information), this researcher hopes to develop broader, more-attuned
instruction, working with both academic librarians and potential faculty collaborators in remedial
education to best meet the needs of this academically at-risk student population.
Lastly for this section, a cross-section of the research in library and information science
and education is examined which discusses intersects between information literacy and critical
thinking. This rounds out the reviewed literature used to support this researcher’s argument of
the need for more research into the academic information-seeking process of remedial
undergraduate students.
On information literacy and critical thinking: Similar, but not the same
As explained in the preamble to the Information Literacy Competency Standards for
Higher Education (ALA, 2000), critical thinking and information literacy abilities are two of the
fundamental elements required for a person to become a lifelong learner. As the literature in this
area supports (Albitz, 2007; Alfino et al., 2008; Deitering & Jameson, 2008; Ellis & Whatley,
2008; Harley, 2001; Johnson, Lindsay, & Walter, 2009; Kwon, 2008; Kwon et al., 2007;
Lampert, 2007; and Weiner, 2011), although the two concepts are related, they are not the same.
However, teaching one without an appreciation for the role of the other in related instruction can
be confusing for students who are attempting to develop a better understanding of both concepts.
As Weiler (2004) shares, “[t]he issue of critical thinking cannot be separated from how students
view their information universe” (p. 47).
Albitz (2007) suggests that there are some professionals in both education and library and
information science who incorrectly believe that information literacy and critical thinking are
essentially the same concept. Albitz (2007) further speculates that this is the primary reason that

48
librarians encounter resistance when attempting to collaborate with faculty to provide
information literacy instruction in classrooms. He surmises that this is because the concept of
critical thinking is underexplored in the library literature. Therefore, librarians may be at a loss
in explaining that although faculty may be addressing critical thinking through coursework,
collaborative information literacy instruction could enhance critical thinking abilities, and help
students gain a better appreciation for the role of both concepts in their academic lives, and
beyond. After assessing the results of information literacy instruction programs incorporated
into first-year coursework at their academic institution, Alfino et al. (2008) discovered
[C]ritical thinking and expression goals of the thought and expression block can
be enhanced by promoting information literacy skills as part of a set of sequenced
assignments, which raise student awareness of knowledge acquisition tools,
standards of evaluation for authority, and point of view. (p. 97).
Therefore, based on the literature presented herein, this researcher asserts that even
though they are essential elements needed for a student to engage in academically appropriate
information behaviors and to become a lifelong learner, critical thinking and information literacy
abilities are not the same and therefore require different instructional approaches by educators.
As the literature cited previously affirms, these approaches can be linked and indeed may more
successfully impart the importance of these elements to students when taught together.
However, where undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework are deficient in either
critical thinking or information literacy abilities (in terms of their information-seeking and
general information behaviors) is still largely unchartered territory. It is the hope of this
researcher that the findings of the research study conducted and described throughout this
dissertation will enhance educational practice in this area. Specifically, it is this researcher’s

49
hope that future research will explore intersects between information literacy and critical
thinking instruction in remedial education classes. Such research might illuminate best practice
instructional methods, which consequently could lead to the improvement of both to the benefit
of all who work with remedial undergraduate students.
The final portion of this chapter presents a conceptual framework for the proposed study
(discussed at length in Chapter 3), based on pertinent theories and models in the realm of
information-seeking and information behavior, as well as a theoretical model of the AISP of the
Millennial undergraduate student, which was created by this researcher as a visual summary of
prior research in this area and toward bracketing pre-study ‘biases’ held by this researcher, based
on her understanding of the literature previously explored and presented herein.
Conceptual framework: Theories and models guiding the study
Although some of the theories and models described within this section were introduced
earlier in this chapter, they have been broken out within this section as they form the basis for the
conceptual framework of the research study described throughout this dissertation. Additionally,
placing these theories and models into a separate section constituted a key bias-minimizing phase
in this researcher’s study, allowing for enhanced reflexivity during the research study (please see
the Epoché in Appendix F for more details). As bracketing and reflexivity are crucial to
appropriately undertaking a descriptive phenomenological investigation, documenting the effect
of prior research examined that could impact this researcher’s perspective in a typically inductive
research environment is both necessary and critical to accurately reflect the lived experience of
the researched (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997; Spinelli, 2005).
The conceptual framework is visually presented through the ‘Theoretical Model of the
AISP of the Millennial Undergraduate Student’ at the end of this section. This model constitutes

50
a high-level, summative analysis of the theories and models discussed in this section, and
constitutes the primary step toward documenting pre-conceived biases about the experience
under investigation, specifically as these biases are founded in the literature. Specific reasons for
including the theories and models are explained in each section below.
Blair’s (1990) “Point of Futility” and (Patrick) Wilson’s (1983; 1977) Personal Information
Systems and Cognitive Authority theories
Although most of Blair’s (1990) and Wilson’s (1983; 1977) research alluded to within
this section was written well before the technological advancements and capabilities available to
undergraduate students currently, it is telling that so much of what they discovered is still
relevant today, and therefore has implications for the way any researcher investigating the
information search process of undergraduate students in general (and remedial undergraduate
students, in particular) should approach that research, both conceptually and realistically. The
work of Blair (1990) and (Patrick) Wilson (1983; 1977) is discussed together here because of the
rational intersects between the two in terms of information-seeking behaviors.
Although Wilson’s (1983; 1977) research was primarily people-focused and Blair’s
(1990) research focused more on information retrieval (IR) systems and peoples’ use of them,
discoveries made by both create a plausible foundation for understanding some of the
insufficient information-seeking behaviors of undergraduate students. This includes behavior
such as “satisficing” (see “Definition of Terms” in Chapter 1), defined here more contextually as
the unwillingness of students to replace inappropriate academic information-seeking behaviors
with more academically efficient ones, and what prompts information-seekers to abandon a
search for information altogether, no matter the repercussions of such abandonment.

51
In his description of the Personal Information System (PIS) in Public Knowledge, Private
Ignorance, Wilson (1977) explains that for most people, the PIS is comprised of information
gained from three main sources:
1.

Monitor sources (consulted daily or near-daily information sources such as news,
etc., and which today could include social networks, trusted websites and online
news sources),

2.

Reference sources (sources that are turned to less frequently and typically used
most when someone discovers a gap in his or her overall information system he or
she wishes to fill), and

3.

Advisory sources (mostly composed of people within the user’s life that he or she
trusts as information sources and therefore to whom he or she regularly turns for
information, even though these sources may be incorrect or unreliable).

In Second-hand Knowledge, Wilson (1983) expounds on the notion of advisory sources
and states that these sources are “cognitive authorities” (p. 13) within a PIS, explaining that
cognitive authority is “influence on one’s thoughts that one would consciously recognize as
proper” (p. 15). Although not necessarily an expert source, cognitive authorities nonetheless
have become information authorities for people based on a number of personally applied factors,
such as educational background, experience with a topic or topics, and primarily because of the
level of trust someone places in this person/resource for providing information (as not all
cognitive authorities are people within a PIS). To that end, one can see why the above-described
‘advisory’ category becomes particularly problematic for both college-ready and remedial
undergraduate students, based on prior research presented within this chapter on the preferred
information resources of undergraduate students.

52
In discussing users and IR systems, Blair (1990) explains that many users encounter a
‘point of futility’ when engaging with IR systems to find information, reached much quicker if
the user is poorly oriented in using the IR system itself. Blair (1990) claims that mathematically,
one can calculate a “futility prediction criterion” (p. 10) in relation to one’s “futility point” (p.
10), based on factors such as the number of anchor terms (terms the user believes are significant
in finding information for the information need within an IR system) submitted to the system
(and altered, adapted, or changed in consequent searches), the number of searches performed,
and the number of results retrieved (whether relevant or not). Blair (1990) puts forth that the
futility point itself is the number of retrieved items a user is willing to look through in order to
find the information he or she needs to fulfill an information need, and the futility prediction
criterion allows one to calculate a precise number of times a user may conduct a search, with
different strategies and/or anchor terms where appropriate, in pursuit of the information he or she
needs before reaching his or her futility point.
Blair (1990) explains what has become known among library professionals as ‘hunt and
peck’ searching in IR systems is problematic because many IR systems are not intuitive (which
is still true today), with controlled vocabulary terms make searching difficult, especially for
novice users. Additionally, Blair (1990) says that a user’s overreliance on certain anchor terms,
limiting or overextending the number of terms used, and the order in which the terms are used
can cause search results to reach a person’s futility point long before the necessary information
has been found. Blair (1990) adds
[W]hile the inquirer may have a single, comprehensive goal which defines his
search normatively, his actual searching behavior will still be characterized by his
attempts to satisfy the sometimes competing processes of predicting the terms

53
describing relevant documents and retrieving few enough documents at a time to
browse through. (p. 22).
In connecting the work of Blair (1990) and Wilson (1983; 1977), it is the notion of
‘cognitive authority’ that may best link the two differing perspectives to information ‘mis’retrieval. Wilson (1983) explains that a source is deemed a cognitive authority for a number of
reasons, but that most of a person’s cognitive authority sources are formed/selected primarily
during youth, and comprise parents and/or guardians, and a person’s peers. As research cited
within this chapter and throughout this dissertation reinforces: In regard to the information role
of friends, family, and peers in a student’s AISP experience, this appears to be the case with
many current undergraduate students, as well. Because such sources often form the basis for a
person’s burgeoning PIS, ineffective cognitive authorities can be deleterious to a student’s
overall PIS (which Wilson [1977] explains are rarely changed entirely, in that such change
brings about emotional turmoil in people that they find difficult to manage and/or overcome).
One can then make the conceptual leap between the negative effects of ‘deficient’
cognitive authority sources on a person’s PIS, and the negative effects of overreliance on poorly
developed academic information-seeking strategies when using an IR system on a person’s PIS,
as well. As Blair (1990) discusses, when users become more knowledgeable about how IR
systems work and discover system-recognized vocabulary terms for their AISP needs,
information searches can become more fruitful. However, many users are often unwilling to
relinquish their key anchor terms in a search, or to stop using search strategies they believe could
be ‘successful’ with some tweaking (despite evidence to the contrary in terms of information
retrieved applying such strategies). Particularly, Lupton (2008) found that novice users had a
habit of asking questions of a search engine (as opposed to providing a search query), or not

54
properly formulating requests for information from a search engine, e.g. Google, Bing, Yahoo!,
etc.. However, Lupton (2008) discovered that these students were overall satisfied with the
results that were returned if they seemed even tangentially related to an information request,
which she speculates is an anxiety-reduction method for these students.
Similarly, Wilson (1983) explains that when someone is confronted with information that
challenges one’s PIS (particularly when that conflicting information comes from someone or
something one considers to be a cognitive authority), a choice must be made: The user must
ignore the conflicting information and leave his or her PIS intact, or views must change,
necessitating changes to or perhaps of the entire PIS. As already explained, a ‘PIS overhaul’ can
be traumatic, particularly for incoming undergraduate students, who researchers have found tend
to be very polarized in their views and beliefs (Becker, 2003; Breivik & Gee, 2006; Gross &
Latham, 2011; 2009; Head, 2013; Limberg, 2000; Lupton, 2008; Yang, 1997).
At the core of both models (and indeed, the descriptions surrounding information
behavior discussed by both Wilson [1977, 1983] and Blair [1990]) is the process one must go
through before one can accept a change in one’s personal information system or information
behavior. For remedial undergraduate students this is particularly problematic, in that their
anxiety is already heightened because they enter higher education feeling ‘lesser than’ because of
their presence in remedial courses (elaborated upon by Bettinger & Long, 2005; Brothen &
Wambach, 2004; Di Tommaso, 2012; Hamilton, 2013; Mittermeyer, 2005; and Roselle, 2009).
Therefore, in her examination of the AISP experience of participants in the study described
throughout this dissertation, acknowledging the roles of cognitive authority sources and personal
information systems (Wilson, 1983; 1977) and points of futility in information-seeking (Blair,
1990) was critical for this researcher from both a reflexive perspective, and during analysis.

55
Breland and Breland’s (1961) “Instinctive drift” theory
Breland and Breland (1961), researchers in the field of animal behavioral psychology,
developed a number of lines of inquiry and practice related to the conditioning of animals
through their research. Much of their work discussed the effects of reward and/or reinforcement
on conditioning behavior in animals, and they developed many successful training techniques
based on their research in this area. However, as explored in The Misbehavior of Organisms,
Breland et al. (1961) discuss a concept they termed “instinctive drift” (p. 684), which refers to
the anomalous return to instinctual behavior of an animal conditioned otherwise. In describing
why they believe instinctive drift happens, Breland et al. (1961) state:
The general principle seems to be that wherever an animal has strong instinctive
behaviors in the area of the conditioned response, after continued running the
organism will drift toward the instinctive behavior to the detriment of the
conditioned behavior and even to the delay or preclusion of the reinforcement. In
a very boiled-down, simplified form, it might be stated as ‘learned behavior drifts
toward instinctive behavior’ … After 14 years of continuous conditioning and
observation of thousands of animals, it is our reluctant conclusion that the
behavior of any species cannot be adequately understood, predicted, or controlled
without knowledge of its instinctive patterns, evolutionary history, and ecological
niche. (pp. 683-4)
It is not the intention of this researcher to compare directly the behavior of undergraduate
students to the behavior animals. However, there may be some parallels between what Breland
et al. (1961) describe above, and frustrations experienced by educators and library and
information science professionals in the area of ‘aberrant’ student information behaviors despite
‘conditioning’ otherwise.

56
As the previous research cited in this chapter regarding the nature of undergraduate
student academic information-seeking shows, educators and library and information science
professionals do their best to instill the importance of academically appropriate informationseeking behaviors in students. However, it is still the case that many students will revert to
academically deficient information behaviors to gratify immediate academic needs, despite being
instructed or ‘conditioned’ to do otherwise and with reinforcement provided by means of higher
grades received on assignments representing the academically preferred behavior (e.g. as
discovered by Becker, 2003; Gross & Latham, 2011; 2007; Gross, 2005; Nicholas et al., 2009;
O’Brien & Symons, 2007; Prabha et al., 2007; and Warwick et al., 2009). Specifically, as
Warwick et al. (2009) discuss, based on the results of their longitudinal study into the
information behaviors of students progressing through their degrees, exposure to appropriate
information behavior instruction, methods, and abilities does not necessarily equate to practice of
appropriate academic information behavior. They add that although this may be evident in the
work of certain students, “we believe that our results demonstrate that experience does not
necessarily bring about expertise, especially if, as in this case, participants lack confidence in
analyzing and evaluating the utility of search results” (Warwick et al., 2009, p. 2411). In other
words, being ‘conditioned’ to perform academically sound information searching does not
necessarily translate into regular practice for students, despite continual exposure, if other
important background factors (such as confidence in evaluating search results) are missing.
In speaking to the final sentence in the quote above from Breland et al. (1961), i.e. related
to the “knowledge of its instinctive patterns, evolutionary history, and ecological niche” (p. 684),
this researcher asserts that perhaps the biggest reason students remain trapped in academically
inappropriate information-seeking behaviors is the inherent lack of understanding on behalf of

57
educators of students’ histories and ‘ecologies’ impacting their information-seeking overall.
More on the importance of this matter shall be discussed in the section related to Williamson’s
(2005) Ecological Theory of Human Information Behavior.
To conclude this section, although the notion of instinctive drift is not a defining theory
for this study, it was included because of its relation to Williamson’s (2005) theory, because of
what the concept of instinctive drift says about animal behavior in general, and because this
researcher finds it plausible that future investigation into parallels between this theory and
academic information-seeking practices of undergraduate students could bear out that instinctive
drift is a tangible explanation for why students revert to inappropriate information behaviors
despite receiving instruction and/or ‘rewards’ for exhibiting academically appropriate behaviors.
Kuhlthau’s (1991) “Information Search Process” Model
As discussed previously in this chapter, Kuhlthau’s (1991) research into the information
search process of undergraduate students and others was illuminating to the library and
information science field. Not only does Kuhlthau (1991) assert an information search process is
non-linear in its progression, but she also discusses the impact of uncertainty and anxiety on the
information search process itself, particularly in the early stages of the process, and specifically
in the initial stages, when someone is struggling to define his or her information need. For this
researcher, Kuhlthau’s (1991) model was one of the primary reasons this dissertation topic was
chosen as a worthy means of investigation. Therefore, including Kuhlthau’s (1991) Information
Search Process Model into the larger conceptual framework shaping this study reinforces the
crucial nature of the role emotion plays in information-seeking behavior. Kuhlthau’s (1991)
model is presented below, as it appeared in her 1991 article.

Williamson’s (2005) Ecological Theory of Human Information Behavior
Williamson’s (2005) theory was developed based on her 1998 model of information
seeking and use, created after extensive study into how older people acquire information that
form the basis of their everyday lives. Based on the influence of researchers like P. Wilson
(1983; 1977), Williamson (2005) discovered that most of the information people found every day
was accidentally acquired, and it was primarily the result of incidental information acquisition
that people discovered information needs in their lives. To that end, Williamson (2005) believes
that one cannot understand the information needs of someone unless they understand that
person’s “ecological framework” (p. 130). Specifically, Williamson (2005) states:
There is a need for an acknowledged compromise position and for at least some of
the focus [on the information user] to move to the relationship between

59
information types/sources/systems and the information seeker/user … There is
also a need to include information sources such as family, friends, and colleagues,
who are not components of “information systems,” but who play a significant role
in incidental information acquisition (p. 130).
As previous research cited within this chapter has shown, undergraduate students
regularly turn to their ‘inner circle’ (family, friends, etc.) for information and guidance when
engaging in an academic information search process. Additionally, they rely on sources they
found to be useful in previous research endeavors, and that aid them in achieving, at least
minimally, the requirements for academic assignments (such as Wikipedia, discussed specifically
in Head, 2013; Lim, 2009, and Project Information Literacy, 2012).
Williamson (2005) also believes that a range of socio-cultural factors affect the
information behavior of people, including lifestyles, values, socio-economic circumstances,
personal lives and work situations, to name a few. To that end, part of understanding the AISP
experience of this dissertation study’s participants was appreciating the influence of ecological
factors on their AISP experience, including to whom participants regularly turned for
information assistance. During interviews and in-class observation, participants were asked to
expound on statements or comments made that referred to elements not necessarily related, either
directly or indirectly, to the AISP experience. In this way, this researcher was able to observe
the influence of these ‘ecological’ elements on the AISP experience, and examine how
participants discussed these elements within the context of their AISP experience. To that end,
Williamson’s (2005) theory cemented itself as critical to the study’s conceptual framework. Her
ecological model of information seeking and use (Williamson, 2005, p. 129) appears below.

60

(T. D.) Wilson’s (1999) Models of Information Behavior
In his article, Models in Information Behaviour Research, Wilson (1999) presented
summaries and outlines for a number of models developed toward understanding more about the
information-seeking behaviors of specific groups. Included are


Wilson’s own models of information behavior (Wilson, 1999, pp. 251-252, 257),



Dervin’s 1983 sense-making framework (pp. 253-4),



Ellis’ 1989 behavioral framework (p. 255),



Ingwersen’s 1997 model of the information retrieval process (p. 259),



Saracevic’s 1996 model of the information retrieval process (p. 261),

61


Spink’s 1997 model of the information retrieval interaction process (p. 262),



A model in which Wilson (1999) links information seeking and communication
(p. 264),



A problem-solving model of the information seeking and searching process
(derived partly on work from Kuhlthau (1991), Wilson, 1999, p. 266), and



What Wilson (1999) calls a ‘nested’ model of the information seeking and
information searching research areas, represented at the end of this section (p.
263).

Although Wilson (1999) does not agree with all elements included in the above-listed
models, he includes the numerous research approaches to information-seeking and information
behavior in this article because he hoped that doing so would lead to the integration of common
thoughts expressed in the models, creating a general framework for information-seeking and
behavior from which researchers could gain greater understanding about information search
processes for different groups, and from different perspectives.
Although no such final model is delivered within his article, Wilson’s (1999) detailed
descriptions of the research supporting each of the included models. Along with the research
cited throughout this chapter on information-seeking and behavior, Wilson’s (1999) ‘nested’
model guided this researcher to create her own theoretical model of the AISP of the Millennial
undergraduate student. This model, which serves as a summative, visual representation of many
of the factors related to undergraduate information-seeking discussed in this chapter, represented
the conceptual framework shaping this study’s foundation and administration.
Justification for the creation of such a model is drawn from Wilson’s (1999) final words
in the article:

62
In the case of information-searching behaviour [sic]; how does knowledge of
modes of information-seeking behaviour [sic] aid our understanding of the search
process, if at all? Research to answer [this] question might best focus on projects
that take a view of information searching as a complex process embedded in the
broader perspective of information-seeking behaviour [sic], and information
behaviour [sic] in general. (p. 267)

Theoretical model of the AISP of the Millennial undergraduate student
As discussed previously in this chapter, a theoretical model of the academic information
search process (AISP) of the Millennial undergraduate student was created by this researcher
based on literature consulted for this dissertation. It is a visual summary of commonalities found
across the literature in terms of the undergraduate AISP as it is conducted to complete academic
requirements, i.e. writing a research paper. This model also served as a pre-study, literature
bracketing process for this researcher.

63

Stage 1 – Potential pitfalls and competing concerns:


Current information-seeking skills/information literacy abilities,



Knowledge of academic resources vs. reliance on information-seeking in popular
search engines exclusively,



Cognitive authority sources,



‘Black and white’ Personal Information Systems,



Other class assignments,



Competing work/family life roles,



Placement in higher education structure,



Attitude to research and higher education in general, and



Time.

Stage 2: Factors/steps


AISP progresses and they physical process (i.e. the keywords and information
resources consulted to find information) refined/reshaped by the student based on
information found during Stage 1.

64


Anxiety (i.e. a facet of the emotional aspect of the AISP) at this stage ranges from
mild to extreme, depending on the success of the physical process of the student’s
AISP in finding information he/she believes is appropriate for addressing the
academic need.



At this point, the student engages in cognitive reflection of the AISP and its
returned content, and may return to one, more, or all steps completed during their
beginning AISP in Stage 1, based on their assessment of how well the information
they have found meets the original academic need.

Stage 3: Factors/steps


Overall AISP evaluated by the student based on the success/failure of process
itself in Stages 1 & 2 (i.e. the cognitive aspect of the process is employed).



AISP confirmed/refuted by seeking additional assistance from instructors,
librarians, and/or support services (writing centers, etc.).



Based on information located through the AISP in Stages 1 & 2, student either
fulfills academic need with minimal anxiety, refocuses AISP with mid to highlevel anxiety, or abandons the academic need completely with high/extreme levels
of anxiety.

In concluding this chapter, this researcher reaffirms that a multitude of research examining
the academic information-seeking experience of undergraduate students exists and has been
conducted for many years, as evidenced by the work cited within this chapter. However, what is
noticeably absent from the literature is research examining this experience for remedial
undergraduate students specifically and, as discussed throughout this dissertation, it is this gap in
the literature this researcher’s study begins to address, toward aiding library and information
science and remedial education professionals more broadly serve the unique needs of this
academically at-risk student population. The study’s methodology, data collection, and data
analysis procedures are discussed in the next chapter.

65
Chapter III
Methodology
The research available on the information search process of undergraduate students as a
whole, particularly in the United States, represents a number of quantitative and qualitative
approaches assessing the process, toward creating a greater understanding of current needs of
undergraduate students (mostly college-ready undergraduate students) for librarians and
educators. However, as stated previously in this dissertation, very little of the research currently
available focuses specifically on the academic information search process (AISP) needs of
undergraduate students enrolled in remedial coursework. As this researcher has indicated, it is
this gap in the literature the dissertation study described herein created a foundation to address.
At this juncture, this researcher would like to note that although many qualitative dissertations
are written in the first person, the decision was made by this researcher to use the scholarly third
person throughout the dissertation in line with the writing style preferred by her college of study.
For this dissertation, descriptive phenomenological methods and analysis procedures (as
described in Colaizzi, 1978, 1973; Giorgi, 1997, Spinelli, 2005; and Wojnar & Swanson, 2007)
were used to collect and analyze study data, and to provide a response to the research question
posed earlier in this dissertation. The exhaustive description of the AISP experience of the
remedial undergraduate student, the end result of the descriptive phenomenological analysis of
collected study data and indeed, the response to the earlier posed research question, was used to
create a thematic representation of study findings model of the participants’ experience, and is
included in Chapter 4. It is reiterated by this researcher that knowing more about the AISP
experience of undergraduate students in remedial courses is crucial if remedial educators,
researchers, professionals, and/or instructors in library and information science are to address the
information needs of these students more effectively. As Belkin (2000) states so succinctly:

66
When people engage in information-seeking behavior, it’s usually because they
are hoping to resolve some problem, or achieve some goal, for which their current
state of knowledge is inadequate. This suggests they don’t really know what
might be useful for them, and therefore may not be able to specify the salient
characteristics of potentially useful information objects (p. 58).
To Belkin’s point, part of creating a 360-degree view of the AISP experience of
undergraduate students enrolled in a remedial English course is identifying what these students
find useful, what they do not, and how they make these determinations when searching for
information to meet a specific and identified need. Without such understanding, educators,
researchers, and library instructors will remain at a loss when it comes to understanding where
weaknesses or gaps in remedial undergraduate students’ information-seeking skills exist, or how
to help these students more effectively through targeted information literacy instruction. As
findings from this study revealed, there is more to the AISP experience of remedial
undergraduate students than simply the process itself, and the entirety of elements affecting the
AISP experience should not be ignored. These elements and their relation to the AISP
experience will be discussed in further detail in Chapter 4.
The next section will address pertinent qualitative research aspects relating to this study,
as well as provide this researcher’s justifications for choosing descriptive phenomenology for the
research study described herein, in comparison to other methodologies used in the literature cited
in Chapter 2. Finally, the benefits and challenges of using a qualitative research paradigm as the
methodological approach for this study will be discussed.

67
The qualitative paradigm
In his chapter comparing the merits and drawbacks of both quantitative and qualitative
research, Smith (1983) states that quantitative (or positivist) research was viewed as the research
‘gold standard’ for so long because, among other reasons, the inherent generalizability of results
from such research were viewed as true science. In quantitative research, Smith (1983), Hatch
(2002), Englander (2012) and others explain that data are analyzed after they are gathered mostly
from large, scientifically selected samples, and oftentimes in controlled settings, allowing for the
researcher to claim to be an objective and unobtrusive part of the research. Theoretically, this
process is meant to enhance the validity and reliability of the research results when applied to
specific populations, as a whole.
However, as many researchers who have discovered unplumbed research depths through
the use of qualitative methods will attest—generalizability is not the complete picture of a
research ‘story.’ Indeed, one of the strongest merits of qualitative research lies in the ‘meat’ of
deep, rich, and substantive data collected during such studies (as Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi,
2009; Hatch, 2002, Merriam, 2002, Schram, 2003, and others attest). This, qualitative
researchers believe, often leads to detail-rich analysis and broad-scale understanding in areas
which may remain methodologically unexplored or underexplored in quantitative procedures due
to the limitations of deductive approaches to data collection. Additionally, as Englander (2012)
puts forth, the notion of generalizability is malleable and sometimes misunderstood when
comparing research methods, and smaller, more descriptive and in-depth studies (such as those
evidenced in many qualitative research studies) may do more to increase the understanding of
rarely studied groups or phenomena than surface-level, quantitative studies—no matter the
quantitative study’s ‘sample’ size.

68
Although Smith (1983) makes clear that each research paradigm (i.e. quantitative and
qualitative) has its own unique sets of benefits, drawbacks, and challenges, a qualitative
paradigm was chosen for this dissertation study because of the strength of qualitative research
methods to produce deep and meaningful understanding of investigated phenomena. Therefore,
particularly through the use of descriptive phenomenological data collection and analysis
methods, this researcher puts forth that the study findings described herein contribute a rich and
contextually deep foundation for continued research into the broader information needs and
behaviors of undergraduate students in remedial courses. As discussed previously, if targeted
information literacy instruction is to be created for remedial undergraduate students toward
addressing their actual information needs in this area, similar to such instruction proposed in
Chapter 5 based on study findings, a deeper and more detailed understanding of these needs is
critical for informing the creation of such instruction.
In preparation for the dissertation study described herein, both quantitative and
qualitative literature in the area of undergraduate information search processes were examined,
as evidenced by the comprehensive review of same provided in Chapter 2. This review was
conducted to create a more complete picture for this researcher of the library and information
science research available regarding the information search process of college-ready
undergraduate students. In part, this was done so that ‘knowledge biases’ held by this researcher
regarding the AISP experience of both college-ready undergraduate students and undergraduate
students enrolled in remedial coursework could be well-documented before approaching the
research environment itself. This process forms the basis of a descriptive phenomenological
technique known as the ‘Epoché’ (Colaizzi, 1973; Giorgi, 2009; Moustakas, 1994, Spinelli,
2005, see also Appendix F), and allowed the researcher to establish methodological separations

69
between the participants’ related experience and her own as much as possible. These biasreducing exercises continued throughout the study through this researcher’s bracketing and
phenomenological reduction processes (please see Appendices G and H for the specific
documents related to these processes). Phenomenological researcher van Manen (1990) explains
bracketing as the term used by Husserl “to describe how one must take hold of the phenomenon
and then place outside of it one’s knowledge about the phenomenon” (p. 47).
As already noted, one of the greatest strengths of qualitative research is the ability,
through collection and analysis, to create a rich and deep awareness of a phenomenon (Colaizzi,
1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997; Hatch, 2002; Smith, 1983). Therefore, the Epoché, bracketing, and
phenomenological reduction during the data analysis process are critical components for the
researcher to include when conducting descriptive phenomenological research. Colaizzi (1978;
1973), Giorgi (2009; 1997), Moustakas (1994), and Spinelli (2005) explain such processes are
particularly important when exploring the boundaries and intricacies related to the universal
essence/s of an experience. Indeed, as van Manen (1990) affirms, not acknowledging one’s own
lived experience with a phenomenon may allow it to subconsciously enter into data analysis:
[I]t is better to make explicit our understandings, beliefs, biases, assumptions,
presuppositions, and theories. We try to come to terms with our assumptions, not
in order to forget them again, but rather to hold them deliberately at bay and even
to turn this knowledge against itself (van Manen, 1990, p. 47).
A more in-depth explanation of descriptive phenomenology and how different methods
were used to collect data for this dissertation shall be discussed in the next section.

70
Qualitative methods
In explaining the rationale behind selecting a phenomenological approach to research,
van Manen (1990) states:
Lived experience is the starting point and end point of phenomenological
research. The aim of phenomenology is to transform lived experience into a
textual expression of its essence—in such a way that the effect of the text is at
once a reflexive re-living and a reflective appropriation of something meaningful:
a notion by which a reader is powerfully animated in his or her own lived
experience (p. 36).
In adding more depth to this description, van Manen (1990), in quoting
phenomenological philosopher Merleau-Ponty, says “[p]henomenology is the study of essences”
(Merleau-Ponty, in van Manen, 1990, p. 39), explaining that an ‘essence’ is a description of a
phenomenon, and that a good phenomenological description “is construed so that the structure of
a lived experience is revealed to us in such a fashion that we are now able to grasp the nature and
significance of this experience in a hitherto unseen way” (van Manen, 1990, p. 39). In sum,
phenomenological study seeks to investigate the totality of an experience as related by
participants in study investigating the experience, exposing multiple perspectives and
considerations in such a way that new insight about the experience is revealed. This researcher
asserts that her exhaustive description of the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate
students, included in Chapter 4, establishes a foundation for further research in this area.
Additionally, this researcher puts forth that this description and the thematic representation of
study findings model of the participants’ experience created from it may inform remedial
educators and library and information science professionals of previously undisclosed
information needs of remedial undergraduate students.

71
Within phenomenological research methodology, there are two dominant approaches: the
descriptive approach and the interpretive approach (Englander, 2012; Giorgi, 2009; Wojnar &
Swanson, 2007). While interpretive phenomenological analysis “aims to give individuals in
particular contexts a voice and understand how they make sense of their experience” (Larkin and
Thompson, 2012, as cited in Ritchie, Lewis, McNaughton, Nicholls, & Ormston, 2014, p. 271),
“the end point of descriptive phenomenological investigation is to present a theoretical model
representing the essential structures of phenomenon under study (Wojnar & Swanson, 2007, p.
177). Therefore, descriptive phenomenology’s ‘end point’ presentation of a theoretical model of
the experience aligned with the researcher’s end-study goal: The creation of a thematic
representation model of the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate student participants in
the study, representing the universal essence/s of the phenomenon studied. Thus, this researcher
affirms that the selection of descriptive phenomenology as the methodology guiding this study
was a purposeful means of extracting key findings about the AISP experience of remedial
undergraduate student participants for use in future research and in targeted information literacy
instruction, discussed further in Chapter 5. The next sections will outline the benefits and
challenges of the descriptive phenomenological methodology and its research methods.
Benefits of descriptive phenomenological research methods
Descriptive phenomenology was chosen as the methodology for this study because as
Colaizzi (1978; 1973), Giorgi (2009; 1997), Shosha (2012) and Spinelli (2005) explain,
descriptive phenomenology requires a focus on a ‘lived’ experience and a rich, detailed, and
exhaustive description of the universal essence of the experience of participants involved in a
descriptive phenomenological study. Although not speaking about descriptive phenomenology
specifically, van Manen (1990) discusses the role that descriptions play in the outcomes

72
produced from phenomenological studies as being pivotal to appropriately representing the
experience under investigation. He states that “a good phenomenological description is
something that we can nod to, recognizing it as an experience that we have had or could have
had” (van Manen, 1990, p. 27), thereby illuminating the universal essence/s of the experience for
all those performing research in this area. To wit, this researcher asserts that her exhaustive
description of study participants’ AISP experience (and not the ‘experience’ as it may be viewed
or understood by a remedial instructor or a library and information science professional) sheds
light on facets that have been underexplored in literature currently available on the topic. This
creates increased opportunities for further inquiry into the specific information needs of these
academically underserved and at-risk undergraduate students by highlighting specifics within the
experience related by study participants that could be probed more broadly in future research.
Finally, cementing the rationale for the selection of this methodology for the study
described throughout this dissertation, Giorgi (1997) states: “[p]henomenology has had an
impact on 20th-century thinking not only because of its rigorous descriptive approach but also
because it offers a method for accessing the difficult phenomena of human experience” (p. 237).
Because the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate students is an underexplored area in the
literature, using descriptive phenomenological methods to create a more broad and ‘intuitive’
understanding of this experience was essential for revealing the universal essence of the
participants’ experience. This researcher puts forth that the exhaustive description of this
universal essence has created a foundational understanding of this experience for all those who
work with remedial undergraduate students, and opened up a potential line of exploration for
those creating targeted information literacy instruction (please see Chapter 5 for specifics).

73
In examining phenomenology as a methodology more broadly, it is put forth here that it
is perhaps one of the more interesting methodologies within qualitative research because its
philosophy aligns closely with the methodology of the same name. However, it must be
acknowledged that different branches of phenomenological thought exist (e.g. transcendental
phenomenology, existential phenomenology, etc.—Giorgi, 2009; 1997; Moustakas, 1994; van
Manen, 1990). Philosophically, the beginning of phenomenology is usually associated with
German researcher Husserl, who believed that the experience was the source of all knowledge
(Budd, 2009; Colaizzi, 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007). Further, Husserl
(as discussed in Giorgi, 2009) believed that within the everyday, mundane experiences of people,
there are shared commonalities, or universal essences. It is these universal essences of shared
experiences that phenomenologists seek to investigate (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009;
1997; Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007). Indeed, the primary assumption in descriptive
phenomenological research is that there are universal essences of an experience that participants
in the experience will share and that by examining these essences, researchers can gain deeper
understanding of these experiences. This allows researchers to become more ‘experienced’
themselves in understanding the phenomenon as a whole (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009;
1997; Moustakas, 1994; Spinelli, 2005).
In descriptive phenomenological studies, methods such as phenomenological reduction
and synthesis/thematic analysis (explained in the “Data analysis” section) facilitate the creation
of a more intuitive description of an experience (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997;
Spinelli, 2005). Through the formulation of an exhaustive description of the phenomenon
investigated after analysis concludes (the synthesis of the analysis process), the researcher can
provide a holistic view of a lived experience, as described by participants in the study. In order

74
to create intricate, exhaustive descriptions of experiences from participant perspectives, Colaizzi
(1978; 1973), Giorgi (2009; 1997), and Spinelli (2005) explain that research questions guiding
descriptive phenomenological studies typically require formats which elicit descriptions of an
experience in as complex and rich detail as possible, therefore a descriptive phenomenological
research question must emblematize this focus. This study’s research question is included in
Chapter 1, and repeated here:
RQ: How do the study’s participants (traditional undergraduate students enrolled in a
remedial English class) explain and describe their academic information search process
(AISP) experience:
a) During the process, and
b) Once the process has concluded and the final product (i.e. the research
assignment) has been submitted for a grade?
In order to explore fully the complexities of a lived experience, data collection in
descriptive phenomenological research draws from all or part of the following methods
(described briefly in Hatch, 2002, and Wojnar & Swanson, 2007, and explained fully in Colaizzi,
1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997; Shosha, 2012; and Spinelli, 2005):


Protocol writing, in which participants are asked to write about their experience as
completely as possible in a journal-type format,



Interviews, in which the researcher asks about and discusses the experience from
multiple perspectives with the participant/s, in order to draw out common
elements or the experience’s universal essence/s,



Observation, typically close observation for deeper understanding of the
participant’s description and explanation of an experience, and

75


Relevant experiential artifacts (the research assignment, for the purposes of this
study) (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; Hatch, 2002; Moustakas, 1994,
Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007).

As Budd (2009), Giorgi (2009), and Moustakas (1994) explain, phenomenology as a
research approach can be challenging for researchers because the requirements for true
phenomenological research seem almost positivist in their approach. Namely, the
implementation of methods ensuring the separation of researcher from researched (particularly
through continual bracketing) in the relation of the universal essence/s of the experience could be
considered counter-intuitive from the qualitative perspective. In order for research to be truly
phenomenological, universal essence/s must be presented as purely and as ‘unbiasedly’ as
possible (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007).
Moustakas (1994) adds that an important part of all qualitative research is heuristics, or selfinquiry, in that deep understanding of one’s own experiences helps one separate one’s feelings
from those of the participants, while being mindful that although the two experiences are related,
they should be kept conceptually separate. In order to maintain this separateness, crucial
elements of the research process in descriptive phenomenological studies are the creation of a
researcher’s Epoché before the study begins, the continual bracketing of researcher biases during
the data collection process, and phenomenological reduction during the data analysis process, all
of which were described earlier in this chapter (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997;
Moustakas, 1994; Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007).
For descriptive phenomenological research to appropriately ‘describe’ the universal
essence of an experience, it is paramount that what is presented after analysis concludes
represents the lived experience of participants, and not the experience as ‘seen’ by the researcher.

76
To this end, the researcher should include substantial accounts of bracketing and reflexivity in
the final presentation of results for the purposes of maintaining and promoting trustworthiness in
findings, as recommended by Colaizzi (1978; 1973) and Giorgi (2009; 1997). Additionally, van
Manen (1990), although a proponent of hermeneutic phenomenological research, puts forth that
cultural and contextual understanding of the backgrounds of participants is critical to understand
participant descriptions of experiences with a phenomenon, similar to sentiments expressed by
descriptive phenomenologists. The critical nature of this understanding is shared by Williamson
(2005) and explored in detail within the conceptual framework included Chapter 2, supporting
the understanding of participants’ AISP ‘ecology’ as part of the experience ‘whole’. Because
this researcher’s background was very different from each of the study’s participants,
acknowledging the researcher’s role while keeping it separate from the related essence of the
experience, particularly in terms of participants’ ecological factors, was necessary in continually
promoting the accuracy of reported results, and trustworthiness in the methods used to collect
and analyze data from this study.
In terms of reporting the results of descriptive phenomenological data analysis,
experiences are represented typically through the use of themes (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi,
1997; Moustakas, 1994; Shosha, 2012; Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007). Themes
become emblematic of these common essences shared with researchers by participants, and are
thoughtfully and carefully derived from data collected during a phenomenological study.
Spinelli (2005) explains that thematic statements are often used to help bring across the
complexity of themes in reporting of results, and are typically a high-level summary of elements
within an ‘essence’ of an experience. It is worth stating here that descriptive phenomenology
seeks not to understand the ‘truth’ behind an experience (i.e. the experience as it actually occurs),

77
but rather where the commonalities of how something is experienced intersect from the
perspective of participants (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997; Shosha, 2012; Spinelli,
2007), representing the universal essence/s of an experience through the presentation of themes.
Indeed, as Wojnar and Swanson (2007) state, Husserl “considered [universal essence] … to
represent the true nature of the phenomenon under investigation” (p. 174).
Reporting of themes is strengthened by the addition of anecdotes taken directly from
participant interactions such as interviews. These anecdotes allow readers of such research to
gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of various essences within the experience being
described, and how themes created by researchers from the data collected from participants are
reflective of the universal essence of the experience from participants’ perspectives. Again, the
continual engagement in phenomenological reduction during the data analysis process is
paramount when it comes to creating themes from the data, in that the researcher limits his or her
own ‘color’ when it comes to deriving appropriately representative themes. More on specific
data analysis procedures used for this study will be explained in the “Data analysis” section.
Challenges of descriptive phenomenological research methods
Despite the numerous strengths of descriptive phenomenological research described
within this section, there are also noteworthy challenges that must be acknowledged, particularly
for researchers in the field of library and information science. As was described in Chapter 1,
phenomenography is a commonly used methodology by library and information science
researchers examining a variety of information experiences. As Andretta (2007), Limberg
(2000), Lupton (2008), and Maybee (2007) share, phenomenographical study asserts that the
relationship between the research subject and the experience are intertwined, and therefore seeks
to investigate the boundaries of variance, and not commonality, within an experience from the

78
perspective of all participants. Phenomenographical research was used by Bruce (1997) to
explain the way information literacy is understood and enacted differently from a variety of
perspectives, and by Lupton (2008) to understand the number of different ways undergraduate
students approach information-seeking when finding information on which to write an essay.
Although understanding commonalities and shared essences of an experience from
participants’ perspectives allows one to associate personal meaning with human experience,
understanding differences and variations of an experience with specific participants, particularly
where gaps in the literature exist (such as with at-risk academic groups like undergraduate
students in remedial coursework), aids researchers in creating a foundation for further inquiry.
Therefore, descriptive phenomenological understanding of an experience, although important in
connecting participants to researchers in terms of understanding and relation (Colaizzi, 1978;
1873; Giorgi, 2009; Shosha, 2012; Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007), falls short in
explaining the true complexities of the variant, or uncommon facets of an experience.
Finally, as the “least social” of qualitative methods (Niesz, 2012), establishing the
accuracy of the way an experience is recalled by participants is difficult. Because the focus of
descriptive phenomenological research is on how participants relate the experience, and not on
whether or not these relations are actual or indeed factual, determining whether such relations are
wholly accurate is not completely possible, something explained by Colaizzi (1973), Giorgi
(2009), and Spinelli (2005). However, what is possible is a careful analysis and presentation of
the commonalities of the experience through the presentation of the emergent themes of the
experience (Colaizzi, 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997; Moustakas, 1994; Shosha, 2012; Spinelli, 2005;
Wojnar & Swanson, 2007). As explained previously, these emergent themes help highlight those

79
elements related by participants which may impact an experience positively or negatively, and
therefore provide guidance on areas worthy of future study.
To conclude this section, this researcher puts forth that her use of descriptive
phenomenological methods to investigate the complexities of the AISP experience of
undergraduate students in a remedial English course at MidState University illuminated common
themes extant in the investigated experience, which were previously un- or underexplored in the
literature, as evidenced in Chapter 2. This researcher further asserts that the complexity of the
experience investigated within this dissertation may not have been revealed had a methodology
like phenomenography been used instead, and that future researchers interested in the
information needs and behaviors of remedial undergraduate students should consider the use of
descriptive phenomenology for the benefits described within this section.
The researcher’s role and ethical considerations
Part of ensuring trustworthiness in data collection and analysis is safeguarding the ethical
nature of research throughout the study. To this end, this researcher drew on the wisdom
regarding maintenance of ethical standards and boundaries in fieldwork from Colaizzi (1978;
1973), Englander (2012), Giorgi (2009; 1997), Moustakas (1994), and Schram (2003), and was
mindful in implementing this wisdom throughout the dissertation study. This included collecting
the data via numerous, triangulated means, and separating herself from the experience in the
collection of the data and during its analysis. These approaches to ensuring a high standard of
ethical conduct within the researcher’s study are described next.
Perhaps the biggest concern when maintaining ethical boundaries in qualitative inquiry is
the researcher’s ability to “balance my research commitments with my desire to engage
authentically those who are participating in the study” (Schram, 2003, p. 137). Prior to

80
conducting the dissertation study described herein, this researcher has read a great deal about the
information search process from the user perspective in education and library and information
science literature. Additionally, the researcher has also helped many an undergraduate student
formulate his or her own information search process for a specific need during various work and
academic commitments. However, as this study’s goal is the presentation of the AISP
experience as described by participants in the study, this researcher took to heart Schram’s
(2003) advice to engage in impression management and posturing in the researcher role
throughout the process so as not to cross the boundary from ‘researcher’ to ‘librarian’ during the
study. As will be discussed further in the “Data analysis” section, the processes of formulating
an Epoché prior to beginning the study, continual bracketing during the study, and
phenomenological reduction and reflexivity during the data analysis process (Colaizzi, 1978;
1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997; Moustakas, 1994; Spinelli, 2005) allowed for meaningful and
appropriate separation between ‘the researcher’ and ‘the researched’ throughout the study.
As described by qualitative research practitioners such as Hatch (2002), Merriam (2002),
and Schram (2003), the triangulation of data collection methods allows a researcher to explore
the complexities of an experience from a number of different perspectives, and adds depth and
richness to the experience’s description, increasing the trustworthiness in the findings reported
therefrom. To ensure the study described herein subscribed to high ethical standards, this
researcher collected data via a number of methods (described later in this chapter). Although
many descriptive phenomenologists recommend implementing member-checking of researchercreated experience descriptions with participants after analysis concludes to ensure the
participants can ‘see’ themselves in the described experience (as shared in Colaizzi, 1978, 1973;
Giorgi, 2009; Spinelli, 2005, and Wojnar & Swanson, 2007), this researcher was unable to

81
engage in member-checking, despite her best efforts (explained later in this chapter). However,
in order to alleviate the impact the inability to follow through with member-checking may have
had on the trustworthiness of presented findings, this researcher engaged in peer debriefing
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985) to review the data at various stages in the analysis process, as a means
to ensure trustworthiness in reporting in the absence of member-checking. Specifically, Lincoln
and Guba (1985) describe peer debriefing as “a process of exposing oneself to a disinterested
peer in a manner paralleling an analytic session and for the purpose of exploring aspects of the
inquiry that might otherwise remain only implicit within the inquirer’s mind” (p. 308) and, as
shall be described in context later, the peer debriefer did just that for this researcher.
Finally, as literature included in this dissertation on remedial undergraduate students
explains, these students may experience more anxiety than their non-remedial peers. Therefore,
this researcher considered it a crucial aspect of the study to continually pay attention to her
impact on participants’ behaviors for the duration of the study. This included attempts to limit
anxiety of participants as much as possible during close observation activities and in situ
interviews by allowing for open and engaging conversation between researcher and participant
during these data collection methods (please see Appendix G for more information). Also, in
line with recommendations shared by the course instructor, participant interaction was limited as
much as possible to occur within the classroom environment.
In order to limit any anxiety participants may have felt when detailing their out-of-class
AISP experience in journal writing, specific but brief guidelines were given to participants on
what this researcher expected from the journals (please see Appendix D). However, even in the
creation of these guidelines, the goal was to limit researcher impact on the nature of information
shared on the AISP experience in these journals as much as possible (more explanation of this

82
included in the “Data collection” section), and therefore participants were given a lot of leeway
in how they chose to complete these journals. It is unfortunate that only two out of the six
participants completed these journals (see the next section for more detail), but the participants
who completed the journals indicated they found the guidelines helpful to their completion of
same. Finally, the decision was made not to audio-record participant interviews or in-class
observations. In this researcher’s previous experiences with remedial undergraduate students,
she observed that audio-recording conversations made them feel very uncomfortable and unduly
anxious. For this study, the researcher chose to dispense with audio recording and instead
transcribe interviews immediately following each interview to promote accuracy and recall in the
transcription. Also, audio-recording in-class observations would have violated the privacy of
non-study participants, so detailed notes of these observations were kept and recorded
immediately following each observation period to promote accuracy (please see Appendix G).
The specifics of the study’s data sources, as well as the collection and analysis
procedures used within this study, are described in detail in the next section.
Data sources
Participants
Participants for the study included six students enrolled in the remedial English course
‘College Writing I Stretch’ at a regional campus of MidState University during the spring 2014
semester. The students from this course were identified as potential study participants in the
early stages of this dissertation because a) they were enrolled in a remedial course, and b) one of
the requirements for course completion is the submission of a research assignment, requiring
students in the course to search for information that meets the needs of the research assignment.
In describing the selection of participants for a descriptive phenomenological study, Englander

83
(2012) states: “[W]hen it comes to selecting the subjects for phenomenological research, the
question that the researcher has to ask themselves is: Do you have the experience that I am
looking for?” (p. 19). As this study sought to unveil the essence of the AISP experience of
remedial undergraduate students, the students in this course represented a suitable population
from which to request participants for the study, because they had direct experience with
conducting an AISP for their research assignment, i.e. the phenomenon under investigation.
When recruiting study participants, this researcher respectfully requested that all
members of the class consider participating so that as rich a participant group as possible could
obtained (i.e. the participants would include both traditional and non-traditional students—see
“Definition of Terms” in Chapter 1 for further description of these student groups). However,
only six students in the class chose to participate in the study, and all were traditional
undergraduate students. Englander (2012), Merriam (2002), and Hatch (2002) discuss that as the
goal of qualitative study is depth and richness in meaning, and not the quantitative goal of “how
many?” (Englander, 2012, p. 21), this researcher asserts that the smaller participant group did not
detract from the importance of study findings: “[I]f a researcher has a qualitative purpose and a
qualitative research question, he or she seeks knowledge of the content of the experience, often
in depth, to seek the meaning of a phenomenon, not “how many” people who have experienced
such phenomena” (Englander, 2012, p. 21). Students in the course were asked to participate in
the study during an in-class visit the first day of the course (March 7, 2014), and students were
assured confidentiality in the study and in all reporting of results post-data collection. Those
who consented to be a part of the study were given the required informed consent forms during
this visit, which this researcher keeps in a locked filing cabinet in her home, per verbiage of
same included in her institutional review board study application.

84
Regarding the demographics of study participants, three identified as Caucasian, and
three identified as African-American. Further, four of the participants identified as female, and
two identified as male. All participants in the study were under the age of 24, and five of the six
participants were in their second semester of study at the regional campus of MidState
University. Three of the six participants explained to this researcher that this was their second
attempt to pass this course, all three having taken and failed the course the previous semester,
although none of them had the course in the previous semester with the instructor of the course
under investigation for this study. Further, four of the six participants indicated it was their
intention to transition to the main campus of MidState University at some point in their academic
degrees, and three of these four indicated they were currently attending courses at the regional
campus of MidState University after being directed to do so by the main campus, in order to
improve their grades. Although not all data collection methods were completed by all six
participants, all six participants did participate in the interview, one of the most crucial data
collection methods used in this and in other descriptive phenomenological studies.
As the course instructor did not believe ‘extra credit’ to be an appropriate incentive for
this study, this researcher offered incremental financial incentives to participate in the study by
way of MidState University bookstore gift cards. Specifically, gift cards in the amount of $10,
$15, and $25 were given to study participants as they completed different stages of the study—
$10 gift cards for completing the one-on-one interviews, $15 gift cards for completing the outof-class AISP journals, and $25 when they met with this researcher to member-check their
experiences in the created information profiles (which, as was explained earlier, did not occur
because despite numerous follow-ups on this step, all study participants chose not to partake in
this step of the study).

85
At all stages of the study, participants were informed that no undue harm or
consequences would result should they choose not to participate further in the study, in keeping
with appropriate ethical standards for such research endeavors (Hatch, 2002; Schram, 2003).
Therefore, that all six participants chose not to meet to engage in member-checking despite
numerous requests to do so (and despite the researcher’s explanation at the beginning of the
study that this would be requested of them as the final requirement), was unfortunate. As
explained, the solicitation of an independent reviewer of data at various stages in the analysis
process was done in an attempt to alleviate any negative impact the lack of member-checking
may have had on the overall trustworthiness of the study, and is similar to the approach taken by
Shosha (2012) in the descriptive phenomenological study she undertook.
In regard to the course itself, this researcher identified earlier on in investigations of
potential study venues that this particular remedial English course at MidState University
included information literacy instruction components to help students complete their research
assignment. However, in conversations with the course instructor prior to the study’s beginning,
the instructor explained that information literacy instruction would be delivered by the course
instructor herself, and not through a librarian or MidState University’s library services. The
instructor shared that in the past she has used library assistance and/or library resources for this
course and found these to be somewhat ineffective in helping students develop their AISP toward
completing their assignment. She had instead created contextual information literacy
components which she delivered throughout the course, based on recommendations from other
instructors and best practices suggested by literature in the field of remedial student education.
This created an interesting situation for this researcher to observe in terms of
understanding the impact of information literacy instruction on remedial undergraduate students’

86
AISP experience, and most particularly, the impact of non-librarian or library services-delivered
information literacy instruction on the AISP experience as a whole, as evidenced by data
collected during the study (please see the description of this instruction discussed in Chapter 4).
As previous literature shared in this dissertation has shown, this area is relatively underexplored
outside the shared perceptions of librarians on this type of non-library-aided instruction available
in the literature. Therefore, recording the reception of such information literacy instruction was
crucial in understanding more about the related AISP experience of participants in this study.
Specific data collection methods used in the study are discussed next.
Data collection
As was outlined earlier, descriptive phenomenology was selected as this dissertation
study’s methodology in reaction to the lack of research examining remedial undergraduate
students’ descriptions of their academic information search process experiences, conducted to
meet the needs of a specific class requirement. The response to this dissertation’s research
question (discussed in Chapter 4) comprises the universal essence/s of the AISP experience as
described by this study’s participants—undergraduate students enrolled in a remedial English
course at MidState University. It is the hope of this researcher that this study’s findings will
create a more fundamental and practical understanding of this experience for educators of
remedial students and for library and information science professionals, as well.
Data for the study were collected via a triangulation of methods which, as Hatch (2002),
Merriam (2002) and Schram (2003) suggest, is a way to promote trustworthiness in qualitative
study findings. Although some descriptive phenomenological studies use interviews only as a
means of data collection (as described in Colaizzi, 1978; Giorgi, 2009; and Spinelli, 2005),

87
triangulated methods were used within this study to gain as much insight as possible into the
entirety of the AISP experience for participants. To that end, data collection included:
1.

‘Point of contact’ interviews with study participants after the final research
assignment was introduced,

2.

Observation of study participants during class sessions, including during
dedicated research/writing/workshop (i.e. lab) days so that participants’ AISP
practices could be observed in situ,

3.

Protocol writing (i.e. out-of-class AISP/information-seeking journals), and

4.

Participants’ final research assignments (or artifacts of the experience),
representing the conclusion of their AISP experience, and allowing this researcher
to examine the way participants used information found during the AISP
experience when completing their final assignments.

These methods are consistent with descriptive phenomenological approaches to data
collection, such as those recommended by Giorgi (2009; 1997), Moustakas (1994), and Shosha
(2012), and were discussed at length with the course instructor (personal communication with
Professor Jane Smith1, Dec. 13, 2013) regarding the most feasible and least harmful ways to
collect data from participants. As previous research cited within this dissertation has shown,
remedial undergraduate students are typified as ‘at-risk’ students, and are prone to higher anxiety
and more academic limitations than college-ready undergraduates. Therefore, all efforts were
made by this researcher to approach study participants and the study itself with caution and
consideration, and to limit participants’ anxiety as much as possible during data collection.

methods and how data were collected through each, are described in the tables below.
Data collection methods and implementation
Table 2
Data collection through ‘point of contact’ interviews
Approach

In one-on-one interviews, participants were asked to describe the
academic information search process they had implemented to find
information for the final assignment. These interviews were informal and
semi-structured and, although a framework of questions was used for
purposes of consistency in this method’s approach to the interview (see
Appendix C), this researcher paid close attention to what participants
shared during this process and added questions, where appropriate, when
something was said during the interview that warranted a more in-depth
line of questioning.

Rationale for the

Although all efforts were made to approach participants for interviews

approach

during lab days (as was the course instructor-recommended anxietyreducing strategy), this was not feasible for all participants and therefore
some were interviewed outside of class. In these instances, participants
were asked to pick a quiet spot where they would feel comfortable
answering questions, thereby minimizing their anxiety but allowing this
researcher a quiet environment in which to hear participant responses for
note-taking purposes, as no audio recordings were conducted.

Basis in the

Englander (2012) believes that typical qualitative interviewing methods

literature

are not aligned with the needs of descriptive phenomenological data
collection methods, and advocates for an interviewing structure that
enables the researcher to learn more about the phenomenon while not
creating disparity between ‘the experience’ and ‘the experiencer:’

89
“Asking for a situation is vital since the discovery of the meaning of a
phenomenon … needs to have been connected to a specific context in
which the phenomenon has been experienced … It is not the empirical
situation that is of interest to the phenomenological … researcher but the
meaning of the phenomenon, however, the situation provides a context
and meanings are context dependent” (Englander, 2012, pp. 25-26).
Additionally, van Manen (1990) believes that a phenomenological
interview (what Rubin & Rubin, 2012, may call a “responsive interview,”
p. 96) is a collaborative endeavor, which “tends to turn the interviewees
into participants or collaborators of the research project” (p. 63),
indicating the need for something more than a general framework of
questions while conducting the interview. Finally, Rubin and Rubin
(2012), in their discussion of the responsive interview, state “main
questions assure that you cover each part of your research question and
provide an overall structure to the interview, follow-up questions get
depth and detail on events or steps in a process, as well as the meaning of
concepts, and themes, whereas probes encourage the interviewee to keep
talking and stay on topic, ask for clarification, or ask for evidence and
examples” (p. 119). Appendix C represents the framework for the
responsive interview which was utilized in this study and follow-up and
probe questions were asked where appropriate.
Table 3
Data collection through observation of IL instruction and in-situ AISP implementation
Approach

This researcher attended almost all class sessions and all of the lab/research
days in order to observe course instructor-led information literacy
instruction and to observe specific AISP practices implemented by students
during lab days, as well as instructor assistance/intervention with same
during participants’ AISP implementation on lab days.

90
Rationale for the

Participant observation is a common practice in qualitative research and

approach

gives the researcher an opportunity to observe a studied phenomenon firsthand. It also provides context to the phenomenon, thereby broadening the
researcher’s understanding of elements that impact the experience. As the
experience is the focus of this study, understanding both the external and the
ecological factors impacting the AISP experience of study participants (such
as those described in Williamson’s [2005] model, discussed in Chapter 2)
was deemed crucial in terms of gathering data from participants which
described the totality of the experience.

Basis in the

In discussing ‘close observation’ as a data collection method in

literature

phenomenological studies, van Manen (1990) states: “Rather than observing
subjects through one-way windows, or by means of observational schemata
and checklists that function symbolically not unlike one-way mirrors, the
human science researcher tries to enter the lifeworld of the persons whose
experiences are relevant study material … the best way to enter a person’s
lifeworld is to participate in it” (pp. 68-9). Additionally, van Manen (1990)
says participant observation practices (such as the one described herein)
allow the researcher to collect “anecdotes” (p. 69), which helps build
context around a lived experience, and increases the researcher’s ability to
understand more about the experience from participant perspectives.

Table 4
Data collection through protocol writing
Approach

Study participants were asked to keep an out-of-class AISP experience
‘journal’ that documented their AISP activities performed outside of the
classroom environment. Because the intention of this journal was to
collect data on the ‘lived experience’ of the AISP experience outside of
the classroom format, and therefore encourage as much free thinking as
possible, prompts for what to include in the journal were basic and

91
followed the format suggested by van Manen (1990) for obtaining rich
data from protocol writing exercises. Participants were asked to a)
describe the AISP as they conduct it outside of the classroom and during
each occasion they conducted a search process, b) describe how they felt
emotionally and physically during each search process, including using
key terms (such as those discovered by Project Information Literacy,
2012) such as ‘anxious,’ ‘nervous,’ ‘confident,’ ‘confused,’ etc., c)
describe anything else that occurred during each search process external
to the process itself, such as an interruption of the search process, a
change or abandonment in the search process due to dissatisfaction with
results, and other considerations that may have drawn attention away from
the search process or that were competing for time/attention during the
search process, d) describe the environment in which they are conducting
the search process, including how they feel in that environment (e.g. if
they are in the college library, are there things distracting them from
completing the search, etc.), and lastly, e) in a concluding entry, describe
their view of the overall experience, including whether they believed the
experience to have been successful or not, and whatever
doubts/anxieties/emotions they are left with after the AISP was complete
and they had submitted their research assignment.
Note: Only two of the six study participants completed the out-of-class
AISP journal. However, their journal entries were processed as a part of
the study’s data collection because of the insight they provided into the
out-of-class AISP experience as a whole.
Rationale for the

Examining the journal entries of AISP experiences outside of the

approach

classroom setting represented a more ‘honest’ account of what
participants did and how they felt about information-seeking for a specific
purpose when not being observed by their course instructor. Additionally,
although only two of the six participants completed these journals, these
entries added more detail to the overall AISP experience.

92
Basis in the

As discussed in Colaizzi (1978), Giorgi (1997), and Spinelli (2005), and

literature

explained by van Manen (1990), protocol writing gives the researcher a
textual form of data to investigate in terms of understanding more about
human experience with a phenomenon, and provides an unobserved view
into the experience from participants’ perspectives: “To gain access to
other people’s experiences, we request them to write about a personal
experience” (van Manen, 1990, p. 65).

it was deemed necessary to also view the product that constituted the

Basis in the

Although Englander (2012), Moustakas (1994), and van Manen (1990)

literature

discuss various ‘non-people’ means of data collection in
phenomenological studies, it is Hatch (2002) who provides a succinct
definition of the use of artifacts as a means of data collection by quoting
Hodder: “the intended and unintended residues of human activity, give
alternative insights into the ways in which people perceive and fashion
their lives” (Hodder, 1994, p. 304, in Hatch, 2002, pp. 24-5). Hatch
(2002) adds that one advantage of artifact analysis is that “it does not
influence the social setting being examined,” (p. 25), something this
researcher considers to be a critical component in understanding the
complexity of the AISP experience.

93
Specific data analysis procedures for this study are discussed in the next section.
Data analysis
Upon review of descriptive phenomenological data analysis methods and techniques
described by Colaizzi (1978, 1973, and in Wojnar & Swanson, 2007), Englander (2012), Giorgi
(2009; 1997), and Spinelli (2005), this researcher chose to use a modified version of Colaizzi’s
method of analysis as the analysis frame for this study. As explained by Wojnar and Swanson
(2007), there are four essential steps that must be taken in any study using descriptive
phenomenology as its methodology: “a) bracketing, b) analyzing, c) intuiting, and d) describing”
(Wojnar & Swanson, 2007, p. 175).
Although Giorgi’s method (2009; 1997) is often cited in high-level descriptive
phenomenological research as the presiding analysis structure, this researcher opted not to
attempt such a grandiose analysis schema in her early experimentations with descriptive
phenomenological study. Rather than attempt to apply the complex structure of Giorgi’s method
of data analysis to this study (as described in Giorgi, 2009, and, which is heavily influenced by
phenomenological philosophy), a modification of Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of Analysis was
used. This researcher determined this method was more appropriate for analyzing the type of
information gathered during the study and for visually representing the findings of the study
through the creation of a thematic representation of study findings model of the participants’
experience. Additionally, the four-step process of bracketing, analyzing, intuiting, and
describing explained by Wojnar and Swanson (2007) is represented through the analysis process
described below, and through the discussion of findings presented in Chapter 4.

94
Epoché, bracketing, and phenomenological reduction
In his examination of the phenomenological analysis process, Moustakas (1994) explains
that phenomenological reduction is preceded by the Epoché, a Husserlian concept in which “we
set aside our prejudgments, biases, and preconceived ideas about things” (Moustakas, 1994, p.
85). This philosophical reflection process conducted by the researcher on his or her prior
experience/s with a phenomenon under investigation allows one to draw into focus those
‘prejudgments, biases, and preconceived ideas’ that exist within the researcher’s mind before
beginning a study. As Colaizzi (1978; 1973), Giorgi (2009; 1997) and Moustakas (1994)
explain, creating the Epoché is a crucial step in descriptive phenomenological studies because
the process allows the researcher to have a very clear idea of those elements he or she carries into
data collection, thereby separating the researcher’s perspective from that of the experience as it is
related by research participants. Much of what has been addressed previously within this
dissertation represents a significant portion of this researcher’s Epoché process, specifically the
creation of the Theoretical Model of the AISP of the Millennial Undergraduate Student in
Chapter 2. This model aided this researcher in the documentation of thoughts, feelings, and
perspectives on the AISP experience of undergraduate students in a separate memo document
before entering the research field (please see Appendix F for specific notes).
Moving, then, from the Epoché to phenomenological reduction (bracketing, having been
discussed at length previously, will not be discussed here again), and in summarizing the nature
of phenomenological reduction in the descriptive phenomenological analysis process, Giorgi
(1997) states:
To enter into the attitude of the phenomenological reduction means to (a) bracket
past knowledge about a phenomenon, in order to encounter it freshly and describe
it precisely as it is intuited (or experienced), and (b) to withhold the existential

95
index, which means to consider what is given precisely as it is given, as presence,
or phenomenon. No work can be considered to be phenomenological if some
sense of the reduction is not articulated and utilized (p. 239).
Building on the strength of the Epoché and the continual bracketing process conducted
during the study, phenomenological reduction assists in the separation of ‘researcher’ from
‘researched’ by allowing the researcher to consciously separate as much as realistically possible
the expressed experience of participants from all other factors which may be a part of the study.
Moustakas (1994) provides a rich and in-depth perspective on phenomenological reduction,
which includes discussion on the nature of horizonalization (p. 95) and its role in the
phenomenological reduction process. In Moustakas’ (1994) view, the process of
“horizonalizing” (“every statement initially is treated as having equal value”—Moustakas, 1994,
p. 97) goes hand-in-hand with the continual bracketing of one’s own notions regarding the
phenomenon under investigation, and both are essential components of the reduction process.
Specific notes which formed the bulk of this researcher’s phenomenological reduction process
during analysis can be seen in Appendix H. The horizonalization process conducted during the
analysis phase of this study and its implementation can be seen in the ‘Significant Statements’
table, part of the series of data analysis tables available in Appendix I.
In broadening the discussion on the nature of phenomenological reduction in order to
explain its implementation with the data analysis portion of this study, both Giorgi (1997) and
Moustakas (1994) talk about the nature of “textural description” (Moustakas, 1994, p. 96) as
being emblematic of the reduction process. As Moustakas (1994) explains of textural
description, “Such a description, beginning with the Epoché and going through a process of
returning to the thing itself, in a state of openness and freedom, facilitates clear seeing, makes

96
possible identity, and encourages the looking again and again that leads to deeper layers of
meaning” (p. 96). This researcher engaged in phenomenological reduction by a) continually
being reflexive and bracketing her thoughts, opinions, and perspectives during the data collection
process (see Appendix G), and b) engaging in horizonalization when analyzing statements and
descriptions provided by research participants, which were documented separately from the
information profiles, and saved as part of on-going analysis procedures in the ‘Significant
Statements’ table. The separation of significant statements from each information profile
afforded each statement value in the documentation process, thereby not unduly influencing the
synthesis/thematic analysis processes conducted later (please see the final thematic map in
Appendix J). In this way, the researcher increased the trustworthiness of the study by accounting
as much as was possible for her perspective of the phenomenon in addition to accurately and
fairly documenting the reflections on the phenomenon from others, while keeping the two
separate during analysis.
Providing a final thought on the role of phenomenological reduction in descriptive
phenomenological study, Giorgi (1997) says that descriptive phenomenology is a holistic process
and therefore a researcher should “read through all of the data before beginning any analysis” (p.
243). This was done at length after information profiles for each participant were created and
before horizonalization was implemented, and constituted the first official stage of analysis in the
modified Colaizzi method of analysis, as shall be described later.
Thematic analysis and synthesis of analysis
Giorgi (2009; 1997) and Moustakas (1994) explain the thematic analysis and synthesis of
analysis stages of descriptive phenomenological study slightly differently from one another in
terms of best practices for implementation. However, their differing explanations provided

97
substantial detail for how best to conduct such analysis for this researcher. Based on their
descriptions, this researcher engaged in synthesis of the various data analysis findings by
creating an exhaustive description of the AISP experience of study participants, which appears in
Chapter 4. This description was written after conducting thematic analysis to elicit the emergent
descriptive phenomenological themes of the experience (see Appendices I and J), and prior to
completing the final step in the study’s analysis process—the creation of a thematic
representation of study findings model of the participants’ experience, presented in Chapter 4.
An overview of this researcher’s rationale for using Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of
Analysis within this study, as well as the modifications made to the method during the data
analysis process, are described and detailed next.
Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of Analysis: A rationale
As a proponent of the methods of descriptive phenomenology implemented by forefather
theorists Husserl and Giorgi (Colaizzi, 1978, 1973; Shosha, 2012; Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar &
Swanson, 2007), Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of Analysis builds descriptively upon the
transcendental phenomenological attitude regarding the determination of the universal essence of
a phenomenon (Giorgi, 2009). Most critically for this researcher’s needs (as was discussed in
person in late August, 2014, with phenomenological researcher Dr. Kiersten Latham, who
brought this method of analysis to this researcher’s attention), Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of
Analysis was selected because it moves this ‘ phenomenological attitude’ from the theoretical to
the practical domain. This provided a means for this researcher to deconstruct each step of the
universal essence determination process, while including data from a number of collection
methods (including researcher-role collected data, such as the Epoché and bracketing/reflexivity
notes), as was deemed appropriate for the study.

98
Wojnar and Swanson (2007) explain that “descriptive phenomenology is more useful for
inquiry that aims to discover universal aspects of a phenomenon that were never conceptualized
or incompletely conceptualized in prior research” (p. 177). As this researcher has asserted
throughout this dissertation, the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate students is a
significantly underexplored area in library and information science research, therefore the goals
of descriptive phenomenological research are consistent with the end goals of this researcher’s
study—a more in-depth and detailed understanding of the way the study’s participants
experienced the AISP conducted to complete their course’s final research assignment.
Although Colaizzi’s (1978; 1973) research tends to focus on the field of psychology, he
has also used descriptive phenomenological methods within this field to examine the concept of
learning, specifically (Colaizzi, 1973). In reviewing Colaizzi’s (1978; 1973) writing on his
descriptive phenomenological studies exploring the learning experience, he explains in great
detail how his focus was not on the ‘reality’ of learning, but rather, on the perception of learning
as it was experienced by participants. For this researcher, Colaizzi’s (1978; 1973) thoughts on
this matter served as a reinforcing and edifying reminder throughout data collection and analysis
that what would be presented after analysis would be the universal essence of the AISP
experience as explained and described by participants, and not necessarily as it occurred or even
as it was perceived to have occurred by this researcher—two very different perspectives, indeed.
Despite this identified/observed difference which may have occurred between experience
and ‘reality’ for participants, this researcher reaffirms that it is the participants’ universal essence
of this phenomenon that is decidedly absent from the research currently available. Therefore, the
findings presented in Chapter 4 and which shall be discussed contextually and in terms of
implications for the field in Chapter 5 may be both enlightening and useful to practitioners when

99
creating a foundation for future research, and when constructing guides/frameworks for targeted
information literacy instruction. As explained by Giorgi (2009) in his rationale for the critical
nature of descriptive phenomenology:
Once the philosopher believes that he or she has determined the essence of the
phenomenon or state of affairs he or she is researching, the next obligation is to
describe it as accurately as possible. … The major implication of this step is that
description is favored rather than other philosophical alternatives. Description is
the use of language to articulate the intentional objects of experience. This sense
of description is contrasted with interpretation, which, in my view, is the use of
language to articulate the intentional objects of experience with the help of some
nongiven factor, such as an assumption, hypothesis, theory, or the like.
Description is also contrasted with construction, which is not satisfied to stay
strictly within the given, but uses imagination or other nongiven factors to either
present or account for the objects of experience. Finally, description is contrasted
with explanation, which attempts to account for what is presented, usually by
employing factors that are not necessarily given or in terms of other known but
nonpresent events (for example, causes). But its goal is not simply to exhibit
what is given. All of the above alternatives are legitimate philosophical strategies
for accounting for phenomena, but they follow from other philosophical criteria,
not those of Husserlian phenomenology. In phenomenology, the exhibition of the
given is the basis of its accountability (Giorgi, 2009, p. 89).
Specifics regarding the implementation of this modified method are provided next.

Modification of Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of Analysis
The table below represents a summation of the modified analysis procedures used within
this dissertation study, based on Colaizzi’s (1978) suggested method of analysis for descriptive
phenomenological study. Specifics of the implementation of the analysis process are discussed

recommended by Colaizzi (1973), Giorgi (2009;
1997), and Spinelli (2005).

1. Protocol reading.

Researcher reads each information profile multiple
times to gain an-depth feel for or sense of the
‘whole’ of participants’ related experience.

2. Extracting significant statements.

Phrases or sentences which relate directly to the
phenomenon under investigation (i.e. the AISP) and
its development during the course are taken from
the information profiles and put together in a
‘significant statements’ table (see ‘S.S. Analysis
(SB)’ table in the data analysis tables series in
Appendix I). This step was also undertaken by a
peer debriefer, and the researcher checked her
significant statements against those selected by the
peer debriefer. Peer debriefing returned a selection
of 91 statements from the information profiles, of
which 88 of the same statements had been selected
by this researcher—an agreement rate of 97%.
After secondary review, this researcher added the
three statements which appeared in the peer
debriefing, but which had not been included during
her significant statement extraction process. As
described in Zhang and Wildemuth (2009), this high
level of agreement regarding the significant
statements representative of the experience under
investigation indicates a strong level of

103
confirmability: an indicator of trustworthiness in
qualitative study involving outside review, or peer
debriefing. This was one of two analysis exercises
involving peer debriefing for the purposes of
increasing trustworthiness in the study.
3. Formulating meanings

Researcher “extracts or spell[s] out the meanings
contained in each significant statement” (Spinelli,
2005, p. 136).

4. Extracting clusters of themes.

The grouping together of formulated meaning
statements under thematic headings, which are
representative of the commonalities between
meaning statements included within the thematic
cluster. Researcher compares clusters to data within
the information profiles to ensure no meaning was
inadvertently added to or taken away from the
experience during the previous steps. Researcher
also ensures that bracketing occurring during the
analysis process has not unduly influenced the
creation of thematic clusters, to increase
trustworthiness of findings and appropriately
engage in phenomenological reduction, as described
previously in this table.

emergent themes of the experience. These
emergent themes representing the universal essence
of the AISP experience are listed with appropriate
significant statements/participant quotes in a

104
thematic map (please see Appendix J) and, as
described above, were created after thematic
analysis of previous analysis steps was conducted.
In this way, findings are put forth which represent
the universal essence of the experience and are
written up as an exhaustive description of the
experience. As described previously, this
exhaustive description also constitutes the synthesis
of various data analysis findings, as recommended
by Giorgi (2009; 1997) and Moustakas (1994).
6. Verifying the description.

This is the second point in the analysis process
where the inclusion of a peer debriefer promoted
trustworthiness of study findings. For this step, the
researcher submitted the exhaustive description
(explained above) and the final thematic map to the
peer debriefer, and the peer debriefer compared the
exhaustive description and the emergent theme
categories presented in the final thematic map, to
the data within the information profiles. This was
done to verify whether the experience of each
participant is ‘seen’ within the emergent themes and
the descriptors for each theme (Colaizzi, 1973;
Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007). The
peer debriefer determined that the exhaustive
description and the final thematic map accurately
represented the AISP experiences of participants, as
put forth in the original protocols (i.e. the
information profiles).

105
7. Modelling the experience.

A thematic representation model of study findings
of the participants’ experience, constituting a
synthesis of the steps of analysis detailed
previously, visually represents the universal essence
of the AISP experience of study participants
(Wojnar & Swanson, 2007).

(*Colaizzi, 1978, 1973; Giorgi, 2009; Shosha, 2012; Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007)
Implementing the modification of Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of Analysis
Consistent with Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of Analysis, the stages of analysis will be
presented as steps with each step’s implementation explained, its consequent implementation
mapped to the relevant appendices in this dissertation, and the appropriate methodological
literature included as it was used to guide analysis. As explained previously, Colaizzi’s (1978)
Method of Analysis was modified to suit the needs of the analysis process of this study.
However, guidance on modification was taken from others who had described implementations
of this method in contemporary contexts, such as Giorgi (2009), Shosha (2012), Spinelli (2005),
and Wojnar and Swanson (2007).
In part, the modification of Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of Analysis for the purposes of this
study included ‘pre-analysis actions’ (as described in Spinelli, 2005). These pre-analysis steps
included a) the creation of a research question, b) the researcher’s engagement in “structured,
focused enquiry with each co-researcher” (Spinelli, 2005, p. 136), c) the creation of an Epoché
prior to entering the research field and d) the creation of an information profile for each
participant, which served as the primary stage of analysis for this study and from which
‘protocols’ for secondary analysis were formulated (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997;
Spinelli, 2005).

106
Pre-analysis actions
The implementation of the first pre-analysis action (i.e. the creation of a research
question guiding this study) was described in Chapter 1, and the research question itself appears
there and in the table presented prior to this section. This researcher’s engagement in
“structured, focused enquiry with each co-researcher” (Spinelli, 2005, p. 136), the second preanalysis action, was discussed at length in the section within this chapter on data collection.
The third pre-analysis action was the creation of an Epoché prior to entering the research
field, and is included in Appendix F. The fourth pre-analysis action was the creation of an
‘information profile’ for each participant. Information profiles were created from data collected
during interviews with participants, and from observation of participants’ in-class and in-lab
behaviors. As already discussed, the decision was made prior to the study that interviews and inclass observations would not be audio recorded. This decision was made in order to limit the
anxiety felt by participants in the study, and to protect the privacy and confidentiality of those
not involved in the study who might inadvertently be recorded during in-lab observation days.
Rather, this researcher took detailed notes both during interviews and during observations, and
transcribed these notes for clarity and accuracy immediately after each interview was conducted,
and each class day’s observation concluded.
Although the information profiles themselves were not created until after the class
observations ended, this researcher puts forth that the trustworthiness and representativeness of
the information profiles is sound because of the careful and immediate transcription of the
interviews and observations used as the basis for their creation, and the adherence to prescribed
methods of collecting data during observations and interviews (as discussed in Colaizzi, 1978;
Englander, 2012; Giorgi, 2009; and Rubin & Rubin, 2012).

107
Within the analysis process itself, this researcher implemented a modified, seven-step
model of Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of Analysis, as it appears in various formats in Colaizzi
(1973), Spinelli (2005) and Wojnar and Swanson (2007). These steps are:
1.

Protocol reading,

2.

Extracting significant statements,

3.

Formulating meanings,

4.

Extracting clusters of themes,

5.

Creating an exhaustive description of the AISP experience of remedial
undergraduate students,

6.

Verifying the description, and

7.

Modelling the experience.

Also discussed in this table prior to the presentation of steps was the implementation of
phenomenological reduction throughout the analysis process.
The next section describes the specific implementation of the first six steps in the analysis
process, with reference made to their accompanying tables within the appendices, as appropriate.
As step seven constitutes the creation of a thematic representation of study findings model of the
participants’ experience, this step, the model, and consequent discussion regarding its creation,
appear in the ‘Findings’ section of Chapter 4.
Steps in the analysis process
In his chapter discussing a descriptive phenomenological approach to psychological
research, Colaizzi (1978) details the procedural steps taken in his analysis of the phenomenon
under investigation. This researcher adhered to these steps as much as possible, adding
modifications where necessary and with guidance from other published research describing the

108
application of descriptive phenomenological analysis processes (such as those shared in Shosha,
2012; Spinelli, 2005; and Wojnar & Swanson, 2007).
Step one: Protocol reading
Read all of the subject’s descriptions, conventionally termed protocols, in order to
acquire a feeling for them, a making sense out of them.
Colaizzi, 1978, p. 59 (in Valle & King, 1978).
Step one involved the reading and re-reading of each of the information profiles created
during the third pre-analysis action (described previously), so that this researcher could gain a
deeper understanding and sense of the whole, or a ‘feel’ for what was expressed within (as
suggested in Colaizzi, 1978, and in Spinelli, 2005).
Based on the recommendations of Dr. Latham regarding immersing oneself in the data
before beginning analysis (personal communication, Dr. Kiersten Latham, August, 2014), this
researcher read through each of the profiles three times before making any demarcations or notes
regarding what could be extracted for the next step of the analysis process. This allowed this
researcher to enter into a phenomenological mindset (as is recommended by Colaizzi, 1978;
1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997; and Spinelli, 2005) before making decisions regarding which elements
to extract from the information profiles. Additionally, this allowed for the phenomenological
reduction process (described previously) to begin effectively, in that thoughts regarding the
experience which could be considered biased were added to the phenomenological reduction
document (please see Appendix H), and helped this researcher truly ‘see’ the experience of
participants in the information profiles. After these readings were complete, this researcher
moved on to step two, described next.

109
Step two: Extracting significant statements
Return to each protocol and extract from them phrases or sentences that
directly pertain to the investigated phenomenon.
Colaizzi, 1978, p. 59 (in Valle & King, 1978).
Analysis for step two was conducted in two parts: First by this researcher and second
through peer debriefing. As explained previously, peer debriefing was included in the analysis
process to enhance the trustworthiness of the study’s analysis procedures (Burla et al., 2008;
Kurasaki, 2000; Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009), and to overcome any
limitations placed on its trustworthiness by the lack of member-checking performed with study
participants at the conclusion of the data collection phase of this study, as recommended by
Colaizzi (1978; 1973) and Spinelli (2005). However, it is worth mentioning here that descriptive
phenomenological authority Giorgi (1989) argued against the use of member-checking as a
means of verifying trustworthiness of descriptive phenomenological study findings, purporting
that asking study participants to step out of their ‘participant’ role and into the role of researcher
was not only inappropriate, but also that participants were incapable of performing such analysis
as they were not apprised of the study’s entirety, particularly its rationale and the experiences
related to the researcher by other participants in the study. To that end, and despite this
disagreement between proponents regarding the inclusion of member-checking in the descriptive
phenomenological analysis process, this researcher believes that the addition of peer debriefing
to overall analysis procedures used in this study strengthened its overall trustworthiness.
Drawing on the guidance of Spinelli (2005), after completing step one, this researcher
then “extract[ed] those phrases or sentences that directly pertain[ed] to the investigated
phenomenon so that by the end of this step [this] researcher ha[d] collected a list of significant

110
statements” (p. 136) from the information profiles. This included identifying and extracting
statements made by participants pertaining to previous experiences with conducting scholarly
research and academic information-seeking, previous course/college experiences where they
encountered academic information-seeking, how the instructor and resources such as a writing
support service factored into their AISP experience, how they felt about their abilities and
information outcomes when conducting an AISP, and their general thoughts/emotions/feelings
related to course instruction regarding academic information-seeking.
In accordance with Moustakas’ (1994) thoughts on how to appropriately undertake this
portion of analysis, this researcher engaged in horizonalization of data elements, affording each
statement equal weight or ‘value’ at extraction, and making decisions on their selection based
primarily on their relevance to the AISP experience. Using this data analysis technique, this
researcher extracted 148 statements overall from the six participant information profiles (please
see the ‘S.S. Analysis (SB)’ table in the series in Appendix I).
This researcher then discussed the purpose of the study to the peer debriefer, i.e. to
examine and describe the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate students, and asked the
peer debriefer to read and reread each information profile and extract statements from each that
he believed related directly to the AISP experience (essentially repeating steps one and two of
the data analysis process described herein). The peer debriefer extracted 91 statements overall
from the information profiles (please see the ‘S.S. Analysis (PD)’ table in the series in Appendix
I). Comparison of this researcher’s analysis to the peer debriefer’s analysis revealed that 88 of
the 91 statements he identified as relating to the AISP experience were present in this
researcher’s analysis (for a reliability percentage of 97%). After examining the three statements
identified by the peer debriefer which were not present in this researcher’s analysis and verifying

111
their representation of the experience under investigation, the decision was made to include them
in analysis going forward. For specific comparisons made between this researcher’s analysis and
the peer debriefer’s analysis, please see the ‘SB.PD Comparison’ table in the Appendix I series.
Step three: Formulating meanings
Try to spell out the meaning of each significant statement.
Colaizzi, 1978, p. 59 (in Valle & King, 1978).
After the completion of comparative analysis as described in step two, the process of
understanding the meaning behind each significant statement was undertaken, toward creating a
formulated meaning unit from each significant statement. For this researcher, creating
formulated meanings from the significant statements constituted one of the longer exercises
within the greater data analysis process because of the precarious nature of this step’s impact on
the study’s findings. To that end, this researcher endeavored to create succinct yet broadly
representative formulated meaning units through in-depth exploration of participant quotes and
descriptions as much as possible, while engaging in phenomenological reduction at the same
time to ensure participant meaning was truly being represented in the formulated meaning units
(considered paramount by Colaizzi, 1978, and Giorgi, 2009). As described in Spinelli (2005):
[T]his formulation of meanings, or movement from what is said to what is meant,
is the most precarious interpretative part of the phenomenological research
process and requires the researcher’s creative insight to both remain true to the
[participant’s] statement while at the same time seeking to draw out of it its
embedded, often implicit, meaning (p. 136).
At the end of this step, 151 formulated meanings had been created by this researcher,
based on the 151 significant statements extracted from the information profiles (by both this

112
researcher and the PD—see the previous section for more detail). As much as possible, these
meanings represent both the implicit and the explicit meanings of the experience as relayed by
participants to this researcher. As a means to verify that these formulated meanings did not ‘add’
elements which did not exist previously, this researcher compared formulated meaning units to
the information profiles, the Epoché (Appendix F), the in-class observation and bracketing notes
(Appendix G), and the phenomenological reduction process (Appendix H). Accordingly,
adjustments were made to formulated meaning units to ensure that this stage of analysis
represented participant meanings inherent in the AISP experience as much as possible. Created
formulated meanings appear in the ‘formulated meanings’ table in the series in Appendix I.
Step four: Extracting clusters of themes (i.e. ‘thematic clusters’)
Repeat the above for each protocol, and organize the aggregated formulated meanings
into clusters of themes.
Colaizzi, 1978, p. 59 (in Valle & King, 1978).
Based on the guidance of Colaizzi (1978; 1973), Giorgi (2009; 1997), Shosha (2012), and
Spinelli (2005) primarily, this researcher undertook the monumental task of grouping like
formulated meanings together into thematic clusters. From this process, 12 dominant thematic
clusters were created. They were: 1) general perspectives on course instruction, 2) role of
instructor assistance in AISP experience, 3) reported confidence in AISP skills/abilities, 4) AISP
experience is simple/easy, 5) AISP experience is difficult/challenging, 6) how AISP is
conducted/implemented, 7) feelings/emotions related to the AISP experience,
8) feelings/emotions related to the course overall, 9) previous course/college experiences,
10) previous AISP experience, 11) role of outside-class support in AISP experience, and

113
12) unique statements. These thematic clusters and their formulated meanings are displayed in
the ‘thematic clusters’ table in the series included in Appendix I.
In his description of how to undertake this step in descriptive phenomenological analysis,
Spinelli (2005) explained that “there may be formulated meanings that do not fall into clusters of
themes in that they stand alone … these too are added to the final list of thematic elements”
(p. 136). The formulated meanings which fit this criterion were included in the final ‘unique
statements’ thematic cluster. This researcher must note here that despite their inclusion in the
thematic clusters table, the ‘unique statements’ cluster is not included in the Final Thematic Map
(please see Appendix J). Methodologically, these statements are more representative of
phenomenographical findings, and although it is recommended that they be acknowledged
(Spinelli, 2005), they were not included in final analysis for this study because they represented
atypical, non-representative findings within the overall AISP experience of participants. As was
detailed in Chapters 1 and 2 of this dissertation, a phenomenographic approach (see “Definition
of Terms” in Chapter 1) to information research is common in library and information science.
In accordance with recognizing this dominant research approach, this researcher explored the
implications of the ‘unique statements’ to the overall study separately from those formulated
meaning statements which could be grouped together logically, so as to adhere to the goal of the
search for universal essences in descriptive phenomenological study.
Finally, included in the “Thematic clusters” table is a column which constitutes this
researcher’s observations of the student’s final submission review. This review was undertaken
to seek out evidence of each participant’s AISP implementation in their final assignment,
constituting the ‘artifacts’ of the experience, as was described in the Data Collection section of
this chapter. As such review was part of the study as originally proposed, these observations

114
were included within this table as a potential ‘13th’ category, which could then be factored into
the emergent themes representing the AISP experience of participants. These observations were
based on whether or not participants adhered to final assignment requirements, in terms of how
they implemented information found through their AISPs. However, as a) the final assignment’s
requirements were set by the course instructor, and b) although factually reviewed, researcher
bias in terms of these observations could not realistically be ‘removed’ from the review process,
this researcher chose not to include them in the final thematic map, opting to keep the AISP
experience focused purely on the observed and related elements shared through the rest of the
map. Instead, these observations will be explored in the discussion section at the end of Chapter
4, and the implications of these observations on the AISP experience, as related, within the
appropriate section in Chapter 5.
This researcher’s thematic analysis process of creating emergent themes from analysis of
thematic clusters and their associated formulated meanings, and an explanation regarding how
these emergent themes constitute an exhaustive description of the AISP experience of remedial
undergraduate students, is discussed next. A table summarizing the ‘thematic clusters to
emergent themes’ analysis process is also included within this section.
Step five: Creating an exhaustive description of the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate
students.
The results … are integrated into an exhaustive description of the investigated topic.
Colaizzi, 1978, p. 61 (in Valle & King, 1978).
Discussed in Colaizzi (1978; 1973), Giorgi (2009; 1997), Spinelli (2005) and Wojnar and
Swanson (2007), the exhaustive description of the phenomenon under investigation is presented
as a comprehensive “Statement” (Spinelli, 2005, p. 140), which emblematizes and expands upon

115
the inherent structure of the examined, lived experience investigated in a descriptive
phenomenological study. As evidenced by the final thematic map in Appendix J, the exhaustive
description of the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate students is comprised of eleven
categories, consolidated within three emergent themes. A summary table of the emergent themes
and their relevant categories or thematic clusters is below, and the introduction to the exhaustive
description of the AISP experience follows.

116
Based on the final thematic map presented herein, the AISP experience of the remedial
undergraduate student is described as a complex, multi-faceted process, which is affected
directly by internal elements related to the experience, impacted indirectly by external elements
related to the experience, and by ecological factors outside of the immediate experience. This
statement is but a brief overview of the totality of this experience (particularly, the specifics of
each of the emergent themes). However, as the exhaustive description “Statement” (Spinelli,
2005, p. 140) of the experience represents key findings from this study, it is included in its
entirety in ‘Findings’ in Chapter 4.
Step six: Verifying the description
This step typically involves a return to research participants for member-checking of
created profiles of their experiences, and verification that what the researcher described
accurately reflects their experience with the phenomenon under investigation However, as
discussed previously, this researcher was unable to secure verification from study participants,
despite multiple requests. To that end, and as was included in the description of the
implementation of step two of the analysis process, a peer debriefer (Lincoln & Guba, 1985)
reviewed the exhaustive description as well. Specifically, the peer debriefer was asked to read
through the exhaustive description of the AISP experience of study participants (provided in
Chapter 4) and the final thematic map (see Appendix J), and compare his understanding of
elements shared in these documents to the information in participants’ information profiles.
As suggested by Lincoln and Guba (1985), peer debriefing helps the researcher stay true
to the reporting of participant experiences in explaining and describing the universal essence of
the phenomenon under investigation. Specifically, Lincoln and Guba (1985) state “[t]he task of
the debriefer is to be sure that the investigator is as fully aware of his or her posture and process

117
as possible (remembering that while it is not possible to divest oneself of values, it is at least
possible to be aware of the role they play)” (p. 308). Following discussion with the peer
debriefer regarding his review of the abovementioned elements, some adjustment to presentation
and wording within these documents was made. Because this additional verification step was
taken to enhance the trustworthiness of study findings, this researcher asserts that both the
exhaustive description and the final thematic map (please see Appendix J) included within this
dissertation accurately represent the lived AISP experience of the study’s participants.
As stated previously, the final step of the analysis process (Step seven: Modelling the
experience) appears in ‘Findings’ in Chapter 4. The next section will expand upon issues of
trustworthiness in the study, which have been touched on at various points in this dissertation.
Issues of trustworthiness
Because this study is not quantitative, nor is it grounded in post-positivist thought,
trustworthiness is the terminology used to describe the rigor of the research process. Usage of
this term was suggested in Hatch (2002), who asserted that the term validity is the realm of postpositivist researchers and therefore is deemed inappropriate as a descriptive term for qualitative
investigation, a notion shared by Englander, 2012. As was described previously, triangulated
data collection methods were used to ensure a broad, detailed examination of the AISP
experience of participants. As Merriam (2002) explains, triangulation is a strong approach
toward ensuring trustworthiness in qualitative research: “[F]rom an interpretive perspective,
triangulation remains a principal strategy to ensure for validity and reliability” (p. 26). Even
though Merriam (2002) uses validity and reliability as the terms describing rigor in qualitative
research, it is asserted here that these elements are consistent with the term ‘trustworthiness’ for
the purposes of this study.

118
Another consideration related to ensuring trustworthiness in the collected data was the
incorporation of peer debriefing (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) at various stages in the data analysis
process. As discussed previously, peer debriefing was added to this researcher’s analysis plan to
replace the verification step of member-checking (or lack thereof) and continue the promotion of
trustworthiness in study findings. Therefore this researcher sought the counsel and analysis
review assistance of a peer debriefer because adding this process to analysis of collected data
allowed this researcher to compensate for the limitations which may have been imposed by the
lack of member-checking in the study. Specifically, peer debriefing at two different points
during analysis added an air of “confirmability” (Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009, p. 313) to findings,
in that confirmability is “the extent to which the characteristics of the data, as posited by the
researcher, can be confirmed by others who read or review the research results” (Bradley, 1993,
p. 437, in Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009, p. 313). Please see the ‘SB.PD comparison’ table in the
data analysis tables series in Appendix I for more detail on specific researcher/peer debriefer
comparisons made during data analysis for this study.
Finally, and as shared previously, this researcher’s bracketing and constant reflexivity
during the collection process and engagement in phenomenological reduction during analysis
(see Appendices G and H) were crucial steps in maintaining trustworthiness in this study. It is
reiterated here that bracketing and phenomenological reduction are important tools which allow
the phenomenological researcher to separate the lived experience of participants from the
researcher’s experience of a phenomenon throughout the study, particularly in the analysis stage
(Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997; Shosha, 2012; Spinelli, 2005). In concluding the
discussion on the need for continued bracketing and reflexivity to verify the trustworthiness of a
qualitative study, this researcher includes a descriptive statement on such from Hatch (2002):

119
[T]he capacities to be reflexive, to keep track of one’s influence on a setting, to
bracket one’s biases, and to monitor one’s emotional responses are the same
capacities that allow researchers to get close enough to human action to
understand what’s going on … [r]eflexivity, “the process of personally and
academically reflecting on lived experiences in ways that reveal deep connections
between the writer and his or her subject” [Goodall, 2000, p. 137, cited in-text by
Hatch, 2002], is essential to the integrity of qualitative research (pp. 10-11).
Limitations of the study
It is the nature of qualitative investigation that although it produces deep, rich, and
meaningful data gathered through triangulation of methods and constant reflexivity and
acknowledgment/documentation of personal bias and impact during the research process of a
study, its focus on a non-specific or substantial population grouping renders it non-generalizable
to the population at large (Hatch, 2002; Merriam, 2002; Schram, 2003). Despite this limitation,
qualitative study was chosen as the methodology for this study due to the gap in the scholarly
literature addressing the research problem and in order to create an exploratory, foundational
framework and model for broader, more focused, and potentially quantitative study in this underaddressed area in future investigations (please see Chapter 5).
Additionally, selecting participants from only one remedial English course at MidState
University could itself be viewed as a limitation because of the smaller sample size under
investigation (i.e. six traditional undergraduate participants). However, although the impact of
extraneous variables on a study are more of a consideration for quantitative study, it was felt that
limiting the study to one class from one course specifically would be advantageous for deep and
meaningful data collection, and would allow this researcher to observe the participants during

120
this process with more focus. This was indeed the case as explained throughout this chapter and
despite the small participant rate of six students, triangulation of data collection methods allowed
for rich information profiles regarding the AISP experience to be created for each of the six
participants in the study. Therefore, although this researcher cannot assert that the findings of
this study represent the AISP experience of all remedial undergraduate students, this researcher
does assert that the findings are representative of the AISP experience of participants in the
study, and can be used as foundational elements for further investigation in this area.
Another unanticipated limitation with data collection for the study was that only two of
the six participants completed their out-of-class information AISP journals. However, these
journals were included in data analysis because they did add another level of depth and detail to
the overall investigation of the AISP experience of participants.
Finally, as a research methodology, descriptive phenomenology limits its focus to the
universal essence/s of a shared experience related to the researcher by participants in the study
(Colaizzi, 1973; Giorgi, 2009; Spinelli, 2005; Wojnar & Swanson, 2007), rather than the
differences extant in that experience, as the variety of phenomenographic studies in in library
and information science have explored previously (Andretta, 2007; Boon, Johnston, & Webber,
2007; Gross & Latham, 2011; Limberg, 2000; Lupton, 2008; Maybee, 2007; Richardson, 1999—
also, see “Definition of terms” in Chapter 1 for a more complete description of
phenomenography). This in itself could be viewed as a potential limitation or perhaps, a
delimitation in that the boundaries of the experience were drawn succinctly post-analysis, in that
the similarities of the AISP experience are the focus for this dissertation, and not the experience
from unique participants’ perspectives.

121
Delimitations and Design Controls
In order to facilitate the creation of a thematic representation of study findings model of
the participants’ experience (please see Chapter 4), it was deemed crucial for the research study
to focus specifically on the commonalities of the research experience to develop as rich and
meaningful a model as possible. However, this researcher also resolved to pay attention to nonuniversal findings outside of the immediate context of study findings, and included a section in
Chapter 4 discussing how these elements could affect or impact future research in this area. This
delimited primary descriptions of study findings to the universal essence of the experience, only.
As already explained, although descriptive phenomenological research approaches such
matters differently than phenomenographical research does (such as in Andretta, 2007; Budd,
2009; Dowling, 2007; Limberg, 2000; Lupton, 2008; Maybee, 2007; and Richardson, 1999), the
use of descriptive phenomenology methodology was viewed as being fundamental to the goals of
this study: The creation of a holistic representation of the AISP experience of participants,
providing a foundation for future research in this area, and for targeted information literacy
instruction for remedial undergraduate students.
The next chapter presents findings from the study as revealed through the steps of
analysis described within this chapter, as well as a discussion on how study findings respond to
the research question posed in Chapter 1, and how these findings map to previous literature and
the conceptual framework guiding this study, presented in Chapter 2.

122
Chapter IV
Research Findings
Introduction
This chapter presents major findings of the study, and includes an exhaustive description
statement of the AISP experience of study participants, and the thematic representation of study
findings model of the participants’ experience.
The exhaustive description of the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate students, a
high-level summary of analysis findings, represents the synthesis of analysis produced from the
data collected for this study—an important facet in the conclusion of analysis in descriptive
phenomenological study, as described in the Data Analysis section of Chapter 3. The thematic
representation of study findings model of the participants’ experience included after the
explanation of step seven in the analysis process in this chapter was created by this researcher as
the appropriate final result of a descriptive phenomenological study. Specifically, as stated by
Wojnar and Swanson (2007), “[t]he end point of descriptive phenomenological investigation is
to present a theoretical model representing the essential structures of [the] phenomenon under
study” (p. 177). Building on the analysis process explained in Chapter 3, and the findings shared
and discussed in this chapter, key dissertation conclusions, implications, and suggestions for
future research will be discussed at length in Chapter 5.
The next section discusses the procedures undertaken by this researcher facilitating
separation of herself from the experience of participants. As these processes have great bearing
on how accurately a lived experience is presented by a researcher at the conclusion of a
descriptive phenomenological study, this section moves the conversation from the specifics of
their application, to how these processes factored into findings presented within this chapter.

123
Separating the ‘researcher’ from the ‘researched:’ Creation of the Epoché, and explaining
the bracketing and phenomenological reduction processes
As was discussed at length in Chapter 3, creating the Epoché, continually bracketing
one’s thoughts, emotions and biases during data collection, and rigorous implementation of a
phenomenological reduction attitude during data analysis, are critical to the success of a
descriptive phenomenological study’s findings (Colaizzi, 1978; 1973; Giorgi, 2009; 1997;
Spinelli, 2005). Used as separation ‘tools,’ these processes were a means for this researcher to
ensure constant reflexivity and consequently, a philosophical and rational separation of the
researcher from the researched. In other words, each reflexive activity performed within the
descriptive phenomenological tradition over the course of this study allowed this researcher to
separate herself from the lived experiences as they were relayed to her by participants.
At the same time, engaging in these processes also allowed this researcher to appreciate
the influence of personal experience with the phenomenon under investigation on her approach
to the study and during data collection and analysis, without having this personal experience
impede the accurate portrayal of participant experience in final descriptions of same. Indeed, as
van Manen (1990) explains, “[to] be aware of the structure of one’s own experience of a
phenomenon may provide the researcher with clues for orienting oneself to the phenomenon and
thus to all the other stages of phenomenological research” (p. 57).
The definitions of these reflexive activities and the roles they play in descriptive
phenomenological research which were provided in broad review in Chapter 3 will not be
repeated here. Rather, this researcher will merely share that as van Manen (1990) so eloquently
described, these activities allowed for an ‘orientation’ to the phenomenon outside of what she
had experienced in professional practice. Because of this orientation and continual mental

124
separation of personal experience from observed/related experience, this researcher was able to
‘see’ things within the phenomenon under investigation that may otherwise have been missed or
misinterpreted. As evidenced by this researcher’s pre-study Epoché (Appendix F), the
bracketing notes written religiously during in-class observations (Appendix G), and her
phenomenological reduction process conducted during the data analysis phase of this study
(Appendix H), documenting pre-conceptions and biases of the experience throughout the study
cleared the ‘research path’ for fuller, more in-depth exploration of participants’ described
experiences. In this, facets of the experience that this researcher had not previously considered,
observed, or thought to examine, were revealed in stark and complex fashion—to the full benefit
of her intentions to create foundational research examining the AISP experience of remedial
undergraduate students. Returning to thoughts shared by van Manen (1990) on the benefits of
phenomenological inquiry: “When someone has related a valuable experience to me then I have
indeed gained something, even though the “thing” gained is not a quantifiable entity” (p. 53).
These ‘gains’ are the findings from this study, which are presented next.
Findings
As discussed in Chapter 3, the exhaustive description “Statement” (Spinelli, 2005, p. 140)
of the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate student participants in the study represents a
comprehensive description and explanation of the experience from the participants’ perspective.
It is a summative representation of this study’s critical findings.
The exhaustive description of the AISP experience of study participants
The AISP experience of study participants, i.e. remedial undergraduate students, is
described as a complex, multi-faceted process that is a) affected directly by internal elements

125
related to the experience, b) impacted indirectly by external elements related to the experience,
and c) influenced by ecological factors outside of the immediate experience.
This description encompasses the three emergent themes of the study, which are
presented separately, and in consideration of the thematic clusters encompassing each theme.
Further, participant quotes which appropriately reflect the nature of each emergent theme are
included within the presentation of each. Although some research using descriptive
phenomenological methodology presents participant perspectives separately, e.g. through the
presentation of profiles of each participant involved in the study, this researcher determined that
breaking out the individual participants in this way from the findings presented would detract
from the holistic representation of the universal essence of the AISP experience for all
participants. Rather, specific quotes reflecting the complexity of each theme are presented
contextually within the broader interpretation of the theme itself.
Finally, a table reflecting the complexity of one of the themes was created as a means to
explain the construction of the emergent themes presented herein. Complete documentation
detailing the construction of the three emergent themes is available in Appendices I and J
Emergent theme 1: The AISP experience is affected directly by internal elements related to the
experience
Internal elements which directly affected the participants’ AISP experience as it was
conducted to satisfy particular requirements (such as the requirements of the participants’ final
research assignment, completed for the course in which this study was housed) were those
elements revealed through data analysis to have the most bearing on the experience as a whole.
They included those elements relayed most often by participants during one-on-one interviews,
and which occurred most frequently during participant observation. These elements appeared
frequently in participant information profiles, and included:

126


Participants’ reported confidence in their AISP skills or abilities:



Whether the AISP experience overall was considered simple or easy, especially in
terms of whether the participant believed finding information using an AISP was
easy, or



Whether the AISP experience overall was considered difficult or challenging in
its implementation, its completion, or in its ability to produce relevant information
at all,



How the AISP was conducted and/or implemented, including how much time was
spent on the AISP both in class and out, whether the AISP was conducted with
focus or in tandem with distraction, and if there was an understanding of the
‘why’ behind the selection and use of keywords within academic resources [e.g.
academic research databases]), and



Feelings and emotions related to the AISP experience, such as confusion, apathy,
anxiety, the sense of being overwhelmed, worry about lack of time, and concern
over outcomes and sacrifices made to accommodate the needs of the AISP.

Some participants shared that they had a high level of confidence in their AISP skills or
abilities, such as the participant who stated “Oh yeah, I’m very confident” when asked to
describe her confidence level when performing AISP tasks to meet the needs of the final
assignment, and further, that she found the AISP easy to implement toward finding information
for the final assignment, and that “even if I find a little information, I still have information.”
This same high level of confidence was expressed by two other participants in the study, both in
terms of how they felt about implementing the AISP to find information for the final assignment,
and in terms of their comfort level with the AISP concept as a whole.

127
However, other participants believed they had more to learn about implementing AISPs
as they continued through their academic programs, such as the participant who shared that he
felt he had a lot more to learn about conducting AISPs in the future: “It’s a longer process … I’m
not comfortable with it right now and I’m sure I have more to learn about it.” When the same
participant was asked why he was not comfortable with conducting an AISP, he explained “I
don’t understand how to cite things … I’m just winging it” and that “I’m better doing hands-on
work, with experience.”
Regarding the implementation of specific AISP procedures, such as looking for
information within an academic research database to find relevant information for the final
assignment, another participant indicated that he found the process as a whole frustrating and
confusing: “I had to find keywords to plug in, but nothing came up. It was almost like a dead
end.” This frustration spilled over into how the participant described other elements of the AISP
experience for him, as he viewed the AISP experience as another requirement for the class which
confused him, and limited his academic progress: “Every time we do it [learn more about
academic requirements for future study], and try to turn … I feel like a tire stuck in the mud –
I’m trying and trying and not getting anywhere … redoing things doesn’t help.” Although this
particular participant’s level of frustration and confusion was not shared as extremely by other
participants in the study, two of his fellow participants also indicated a general sense of
frustration and confusion with the AISP experience overall, and particularly, that they knew that
they would have to learn more about the process in future courses if they were to succeed in
those courses, and beyond.
This theme encompasses those elements which had the most direct effect on the AISP
experience for participants, as evidenced by the quotes from participants included above.

128
Although some participants indicated they had a high level of confidence in their AISP skills and
abilities, others shared that the process made them uncomfortable, and that they knew they had
more to learn about the AISP as a whole going forward. For this researcher, the crux of this
theme was the emotion affecting the AISP experience for participants, both when they engaged
in AISP tasks, and in terms of how they felt about the AISP as a whole. As shall be discussed in
Chapter 5, future research could investigate ways to reduce anxiety associated with specific
AISP tasks for remedial undergraduate students, toward more completely addressing those
elements directly affecting the AISP experience for these students.
Emergent theme 2: The AISP experience is impacted indirectly by external elements related to
the experience
External elements which indirectly impacted the participants’ AISP experience as it was
conducted to satisfy particular requirements were those elements revealed through data analysis
to have secondary bearing on the experience as a whole. These elements appeared less
frequently than the elements described in the first emergent theme of study findings above, but
were nonetheless quite apparent in participants’ information profiles. They included:


Previous AISP experience of participants, i.e. whether an AISP had been
conducted prior to its introduction in this course, and if it had, how that
experience shaped attitudes and opinions of the process as a whole, either
positively or negatively,



The role of instructor assistance in the AISP experience, i.e. if the instructor’s
assistance was sought, how the assistance as it related to conducting the AISP
clarified or confused expectations, whether the instruction was believed to be
effective in learning appropriate methods for conducting the AISP, and whether

129
the instructor’s assistance was effective or ineffective in guiding participant
AISPs to find relevant information, and


The role of outside-class support in the overall AISP experience, i.e. the impact of
writing support service staff assistance on overall confidence or lack thereof in
adhering to assignment requirements, the search for guidance in using the AISP to
complete the assignment from a trusted family member, and the perception of the
impact of library instruction on overall understanding of the AISP experience.

As evidenced in the participants’ information profiles, most explained that they had prior
experience with academic information-seeking in some way. This included two participants who
indicated they had learned prior to college how to look for information for educational reasons,
another participant who had learned about conducting academic research during an in-class visit
to MidState University’s campus library (although this same participant said of the librarian’s
explanation of same that “he definitely talked more than he should have”), and the participant
who indicated being exposed to the concept when he took this course in the previous semester
from another instructor.
In the case of the participants who had learned about conducting an AISP prior to
attending MidState University, two expressed confidence in knowing how to perform an AISP to
meet the requirements of the final assignment for the course in which this study was housed
without seeking additional assistance, while the other indicated he frequently requested guidance
from the course instructor and his mother, whom he considered an expert on the matter because
she had a master’s degree and served as a writing tutor at another college campus. Another
participant in the study also described consulting her mother for assistance with completing the

130
AISP for the class, expressing that because her mother had a master’s degree, she believed her
mother could help her most particularly with her “works cited.”
The four participants in the study who indicated they had sought the assistance of the
course instructor to learn more about conducting the AISP to meet the needs of the final
assignment had mixed reactions regarding the usefulness of doing so. Only two of the
participants reported feeling that the course instructor’s assistance had helped them understand
the process more completely, although both of these participants indicated they still found the
process to be overwhelming and they knew they would require additional assistance at some
point. The two participants who reported finding the course instructor’s assistance less than
useful explained they found the assistance more confusing or frustrating than was necessary.
Specifically, one participant said the instructor’s assistance often left her feeling “confused” and
“stupid,” and specifically, that she found the instructor’s explanations regarding the final
assignment hard to understand: “Like when she explained the works cited – [the instructor] made
it harder than it actually was … which makes it more confusing.” The other participant shared
that “asking for teacher’s help can confuse you more at times – make you feel more lost. The
way she explains it [assignment requirements], it’s more confusing.” Further, the participant
expressed a general frustration with the instructor’s assistance overall: “You think you’re going
to get the help you need and then you ask for help and it’s completely confusing.”
Finally, although all six participants indicated they knew about support services outside
of the course which could help them learn more about conducting AISPs to meet course
requirements, only one participant shared his experience regarding consulting these resources in
the past. Specifically, when taking this course in the previous semester, the participant indicated
that based on the recommendation of the previous course’s instructor, he consulted the staff at

131
the campus writing support service for assistance. However, he was less than pleased with the
outcome of this consultation: “It was a big failure – I don’t know if I would go back to them
again [because] they gave the wrong advice.” Indeed, the participant explained that the advice
given by the writing support service’s staff was so off the mark in terms of class requirements
that when he shared his experience with the previous course instructor, he and the rest of his
classmates were told they did not have to return to the writing support service for assistance.
Therefore, the participant indicated he did not know whether he would return to this service for
assistance in the future.
This theme emblematizes those elements which had an indirect impact on the AISP
experience for participants, as evidenced by the quotes from participants included above.
Although most participants indicated having prior experience with conducting an AISP to meet
the needs of a class assignment prior to the one introduced in this course, the majority of these
same participants also felt unable to complete the AISP on their own and sought assistance—two
from their mothers and from the course instructor, and two referred to the course instructor
alone. As described above, reactions to the assistance received from the course instructor was
mixed, with only two participants believing the instructor’s assistance was helpful to them as
they conducted their AISPs. However, these same two participants explained that they found the
process overwhelming and would most likely need help with the process in future courses. The
other two participants who sought the instructor’s assistance indicated that the assistance left
them feeling more confused and frustrated than they were before receiving such assistance. And,
as related above, although all participants had knowledge of outside support services which
could assist them in learning more about conducting an AISP, only one participant had consulted
such a service in the past, and his experience was overwhelmingly negative.

132
As shall be discussed in Chapter 5, future research could investigate specific and
collaborative instructional methods to better serve the information needs of remedial
undergraduate students, toward more completely addressing those elements indirectly impacting
the AISP experience for these students.
Emergent theme 3: The AISP experience is influenced by ecological factors outside of the
immediate experience.
Finally, ecological factors outside of participants’ immediate AISP experience were those
factors revealed through data analysis to nonetheless influence the experience in some way.
These factors were revealed during interviews with participants and in observation of their in-lab
AISP tasks, and which came up in responses to questions asking about participants’ feelings
about overall course instruction and how they felt about the course as a whole, and in discussion
about their previous academic experiences outside of the course in which this study was housed.
These factors included:


General perspectives on course instruction, i.e. the influence of competing
assignments in the course on the amount of time spent on the AISP for the final
assignment, if course instruction overall led to enlightenment and inspiration or
confusion and discomfort, or whether instruction was perceived to prepare
participants for future academic work,



Feelings and emotions related to the course overall, i.e. whether participants were
excited and engaged by the course or frustrated and apathetic, whether teaching
styles confirmed or conflicted with their worldviews and academic perspectives,
or whether the course motivated them to think more in-depth about the subjects
covered within, or left them feeling concerned about their abilities to succeed in
future academic work, and

133


Previous course or college experience, i.e. the perspective of a participants who
had failed the course previously and therefore had to retake it vs. the perspective
of a ‘first timer’ participant, whether previous college experience made the
participant feel prepared for the rigor expected of the course or had left them with
unrealistic expectations in this area, and whether time management had been
learned and effectively applied to achieve school/life balance.

As indicated previously, at least two of the participants in this study had taken this same
course in a previous semester and failed, and were therefore retaking the course in order to fulfill
the academic requirements necessary before advancing to introductory college-level coursework.
Therefore as one might imagine, these participants expressed different frustrations and anxieties
to those of other participants who were taking this course for the first time. Although some
participants expressed positive sentiments in relation to the three factors stated above, others
shared negative sentiments and discussed their numerous concerns about the course in general,
and non-AISP related course instruction in particular.
Three of the six participants shared that they felt the course was preparing them for future
academic work, and that the course instruction, albeit somewhat overwhelming, was helping
them prepare for the rigor that would be expected in other courses. In particular, one participant
likened her experience in the course to a spiritual experience, stating “I literally feel like a
Christian who just left church” in describing how she feels after each class session ends. The
other two participants indicated that they appreciated the instructor’s one-on-one assistance with
course assignments, and expressed overall that course instruction reinforced learning, both in
terms of what was expected for the AISP, and in terms of other assignments (such as grammar
assignments, etc.).

134
Further, all three of these participants shared that although previous academic
experiences made them feel like they were solid students, this course in particular helped them
appreciate where their academic skills would need work, and prepare accordingly, emblematized
by the student who compared his minimal workload in high school to the heightened workload
he felt he now had to manage at MidState University. How these ecological factors influenced
the AISP experience despite falling outside of the experience itself was evidenced by these
participants’ explanations of how they felt learning about conducting an AISP was preparing
them for future assignments, and that the course overall was helping prepare them for future
academic work. One of these participants in particular indicated he believed the standard of his
academic work had improved substantially over the duration of the course, and that the multiple
assignments also allowed him to appreciate the workload he would experience as he continued
through his program of study.
However, as explained previously in this theme, there were three participants who
expressed concern about course instruction and the course overall, both in relation to the AISP
experience, and to their experiences outside of the course itself. In response to a question asking
about how she felt about the instruction received to complete the AISP and other assignments in
the course, one participant shared that she found the guidance they received on how to use lab
time insufficient: “[The instructor] just throws us in the computer lab and I don’t know what
we’re supposed to do.” Also, as explained in a previous theme, this same participant said that
instruction and instructor assistance often made her feel “confused” and “stupid,” and that
although she liked the course instructor, the course itself was “not really my cup of tea.” She
explained further that she found the workload in the course to be unreasonable: “I have
competing assignments as well,” and expressed that the lack of due dates for assignments in the

135
course syllabus for assignments often left her unsure of what was required and when. Of the
other two participants who expressed concern, both had failed this course in the previous
semester and although one was confident that she would succeed this time around, the other
participant was not so sure. In his own words, “I hope I pass this class by some miracle.”
The detail included within this theme has attempted to show that ecological factors
outside of the immediate AISP experience nonetheless influenced the way participants explained
and described their AISP experience as a whole. Indeed, as this researcher well knows based on
personal experience with academic frustration, one cannot compartmentalize feelings of anxiety,
frustration, and confusion, and where these emotions arise in one area, so it is rational to
conclude that they will arise and impact other areas in one’s life, as well. Further, that
educational experiences outside of the course in which this study was housed, and instruction
delivered in the course related to non-AISP requiring assignments nonetheless influenced the
way participants related their AISP experience (as explored in the previous themes) was tangible
through the way participants in this study discussed these factors. To that end, future research
could attempt to create a more comprehensive list of ecological factors which could possibly
influence the information needs and behaviors of remedial undergraduate students.
As discussed at the beginning of this section, this researcher created a table for the first
emergent theme reflecting its complexity through presentation of its associated thematic clusters,
and including a sample of the formulated meaning statements found within each thematic cluster.
For a complete listing of all emergent themes and their correlating thematic clusters/formulated
meaning statements, please see the final thematic map in Appendix J.

Competing course/academic concerns was a major
reason participant did not spend a lot of time or

The next section discusses the last step in the analysis process described in Chapter 3: the
modelling of the AISP experience of study participants. This seventh step is included here
because its implementation was the creation of a thematic representation of study findings model
of the participants’ experience. Therefore, the next section provides the specifics behind how
this thematic representation of study findings model was created, and includes a section
comparing and contrasting this model to the theoretical model of the AISP of the Millennial
undergraduate student presented in Chapter 2.
Modelling the experience (Step seven in the modified Colaizzi (1978) Method of Analysis)
The thematic representation of study findings model of the participants’ experience
presented below was created by this researcher as the concluding step in the modified Colaizzi
(1978) method of analysis used in this study. It is presented as a visual summary of the
exhaustive description provided above, and more specifically, was created as a means to visually
present the emergent themes of participants’ explained and described AISP experience.
Representing the multi-faceted categories within each theme, this model places the
remedial undergraduate student participant at the ‘center,’ representing the descriptive
phenomenological premise that the theoretical model of the experience is “a universal skeleton
that can be filled in with the rich story of each informant” (Schonwald, 1998, in Wojnar &
Swanson, 2007), as given in the emergent themes presented above. The totality of the
experience as shared by ‘the rich story of each informant’ is represented by the shapes

140
surrounding the remedial undergraduate student center: the square representing the four internal
elements directly affecting the AISP experience, the inner triangle representing the three external
elements indirectly impacting the AISP experience, and the outer triangle representing the
ecological factors outside of the immediate experience which nonetheless had influence on the
experience and indeed, the participant him or herself.
This researcher asserts it is these three emergent themes which constitute the universal
essence of the AISP experience of study participants. How this thematic representation of study
findings model compares to the theoretical model in Chapter 2 shall be discussed after
presentation of the thematic representation of study findings model, below.
A thematic representation of study findings model of the participants’ experience

141
A comparison of models presented in this dissertation
As discussed previously in this chapter, the thematic representation of study findings
model presented above represents the AISP experience of participants in this study only.
However, this researcher nonetheless supports that it adds critical insight regarding this subject
to the library and information science literature, and most particularly, the literature represented
as a visual summary by the ‘Theoretical model of the AISP of the Millennial student’ included in
Chapter 2, hereinafter referred to as ‘the Chapter 2 model’ for purposes of clarification. The
model above will hereinafter be referred to as ‘the Chapter 4 model.’
In comparing the models to one another, one can see some similarity in the physical,
affective (the emotions embedded within the AISP experience), and cognitive (the thoughts
concerning the process and the content) aspects included in both models, as was originally
discussed and presented in Kuhlthau’s (1991) Information Search Process (ISP) model.
However, the most palpable difference between the two is the Chapter 2 model’s presentation of
the various stages of the AISP experience, and the Chapter 4 model’s presentation of elements
and factors associated with the AISP experience.
As explored through the presentation of ‘stages’ in the Chapter 2 model, although not
linear, the process described is mostly procedural, as evidenced by the representation of the
process as occurring in stages. Additionally, as explained within Chapter 2, elements within the
various stages and indeed the stages themselves can be changed, reversed, or revised depending
on a Millennial undergraduate student’s AISP needs, or his or her evaluation of the process
within each stage. This visual representation was founded directly on descriptions of same
included in the work of Dervin (1999; 1998; 1983), Kuhlthau (1991), and (T.D) Wilson (1999).
However, the Chapter 4 model represents the emergent themes of the AISP experience of
study participants, which were more appropriately represented as internal elements, external

142
elements, and ecological factors, and which had varying levels of effect, impact, and influence
on the AISP experience as related by participants. Specifically, the Chapter 4 model represents
the AISP experience of participants as a continual, all-encompassing experience—in other
words, a change cannot be made to one of the ‘emergent themes’ without change occurring to
one or both of the other ‘themes.’ As opposed to changes in factors or steps comprising the
various stages in the Chapter 2 model, changes within an emergent theme may have much more
dramatic consequences for remedial undergraduate students. Hearkening back to the wisdom of
Wilson (1983; 1977) included in Chapter 2 then, this researcher can see parallels between the
universal AISP experience of participants in this study and how much of this experience could be
affected, impacted, or influenced by a change in his or her personal information system.
Additionally, as discussed in Kuhlthau’s (1991) exploration of the information search process,
affective or emotional aspects of information-seeking (i.e. anxiety) play a defined role in the
overall AISP experience of participants—directly, indirectly, and in relation to factors outside of
the immediate experience influencing the experience itself, as discussed in the description of
emergent themes of the experience presented in this chapter.
That this researcher chose to present the Chapter 2 model as procedural and stagedependent was intentional, based on her understanding of the academic information search
process as explored in literature available on the topic. Additionally, represented within the
various stages are specifics related to the physical, affective, and cognitive aspects of
information-seeking, as introduced in Kuhlthau’s (1991) ISP model, and how these aspects play
out in each stage of the Chapter 2 model (i.e. how cognitive aspects may change between stages,
how affective aspects may be heightened or decreased, etc.). However, as discussed above, the
AISP experience of participants was more appropriately represented through the emergent

143
themes constituting the universal essence of the experience, which was not procedural or stagedependent in the slightest. Further, although physical, affective, and cognitive aspects related to
the AISP experience of participants are evident in the Chapter 4 model as well, one can see a
stark difference between these aspects for research participants represented via this model, and
the theoretical ‘Millennial student’ categorized in the Chapter 2 model.
Therefore, the Chapter 4 model’s illustration of the continual, all-encompassing nature of
the AISP experience for study participants may add an appreciation for the possible depth and
complexity of this experience for similar groups of students in future study, particularly in terms
of the affective and cognitive differences between participants and college-ready undergraduate
students in terms of their academic information-seeking experiences. Additionally, future
research which explores the complexity of each theme presented in the Chapter 4 model may
enable remedial instructors and library and information science professionals to be a little more
targeted in their approach to information literacy instruction for remedial undergraduate students.
More on possible directions for future research and how the study’s findings may impact the
creation of targeted information literacy instruction will be discussed at length in Chapter 5.
Regarding non-universal study findings (the ‘phenomenographical’ considerations)
As mentioned above in the description of the analysis conducted to complete step four of
the modification of Colaizzi’s (1978) Method of Analysis, when this researcher categorized
formulated meanings into thematic clusters, a 12th cluster was identified: Unique statements.
These seven statements, either shared by participants or observed in-class by this researcher,
were related to the AISP experience as a whole. However, as they did not logically ‘fit’ within
any of the other thematic clusters, nor did they appear to fit logically within the broader
emergent themes of the study, these statements were not included in other categories.

144
As discussed previously in this dissertation, phenomenographical research, which
explores the variance, and not the universal essence, of a lived experience, is a dominant line of
inquiry in library and information science, particularly because these variant themes are used to
inform professional practice, as was explained in Chapter 2. Because phenomenographical
intentions are almost antithetical to descriptive phenomenological intentions, the implications of
these unique statements were not explored in great depth for this study. However, they were
included as a category within the ‘Thematic clusters’ table (see the series in Appendix I) for the
purposes of transparency in reporting of analysis results, and to maintain high levels of
trustworthiness which this researcher has endeavored tirelessly to maintain throughout the study
described herein. Perhaps these ‘unique’ ideas could be explored further in future research into
the information behaviors of remedial undergraduate students. However, that time is not now.
A discussion of study findings a) in response to the study’s research question, b) within
the context of the relevant literature and the conceptual framework presented in Chapter 2, and c)
in recognition of limitations experienced during the study, and concludes this chapter.
Discussion
Responding to the study’s research question
As included in Chapters 1 and 3, this study’s research question asked how participants in
the study described throughout this dissertation explained and described their AISP experience
both during the process and once the process had concluded and they submitted their final
research assignment, for which the AISP was conducted. To that end, and in response to this
research question, this researcher puts forth that the AISP experience of remedial undergraduate
students in this study was explained and described by them as:

145


An experience impacted during the process by emotion, instructor expectations
and instructional clarity, perception of ease or difficulty in its implementation,
personal motivation, prior experience, and the success or failure of external
support systems, and



An experience influenced by a range of emotions including confidence,
frustration, anxiety, and confusion, and one which left participants anxious and
uncertain about their success in the course and in future academic pursuits after
the process concluded via submission of the final research assignment.

This complex and multi-faceted experience was further explained by participants to be
influenced by how useful they perceived direct assistance with the AISP to be (such as that
provided by the instructor), whether or not they felt confident or anxious about their AISP
abilities and skills, and how the way they conducted the AISP would affect their performance in
the course as a whole, particularly for those who had taken and failed the course during the
previous semester.
The largest categories created in final analysis represent the factors which these
participants explained and described had the most bearing on their AISP experience: The
creation and implementation of the AISP to meet the needs of the final course assignment (and
whether or not they believed it had been successful in meeting these needs), the feelings and
emotions related to both the AISP experience and the course for which it was conducted (of
which anxiety, pressure, confusion, and the sense of being overwhelmed were related the most
by participants), and the role instructor assistance with conducting the AISP played in their
overall understanding and comfort level with the AISP experience.

146
That emotions like uncertainty and anxiety can affect negatively a person’s information
search process is not a new concept for library and information science professionals, having
been explored at length by information researchers like Dervin (1999; 1998; 1983; and with
Nilan in 1986), Kuhlthau (1991; 1987), Williamson (2005), (P.) Wilson (1983; 1977) (T.D.)
Wilson (1999), and many others, as explained in Chapter 2. However, what findings from this
study revealed, and which this researcher has not previously seen explored in great detail in the
scant research available on the information experiences of remedial undergraduate student, is the
emergence of a concept which this researcher refers to succinctly as academic hopelessness.
As related through participants’ description and explanation of the AISP experience in
response to this study’s research question, and as was apparent across the three emergent themes
representing the universal essence of this experience, the influence that a general sense of
academic hopelessness has on a) how these students engage in learning tasks like conducting
AISPs, b) how and who they ask for assistance (and whether or not they believe that assistance
helps or hurts them in the long run), and c) their feelings and emotions related to learning tasks
like AISPs, and their learning experiences as a whole, is both profound and limitless. Based on
the rich and detailed description of their AISP experience provided by participants, and based on
the complexity of each of the emergent themes described previously in this chapter, this
researcher asserts that this study’s finding defined as academic hopelessness is twofold: 1) the
concept of academic hopelessness and its ramifications for remedial educators and library and
information science professionals is perhaps the most significant contribution this study makes to
the current literature available on the information needs and behaviors of remedial undergraduate
students, and 2) as represented by specific quotes from participants included within each of the

147
emergent themes, for remedial undergraduate students, academic hopelessness could be biggest
impediment to learning academically appropriate information-seeking skills.
One area in which academic hopelessness was revealed as encompassing the AISP
experience of participants was through their explanation and description of the assistance they
sought to complete the AISP, and consequently the final assignment for the course. That some
participants indicated they sought out the assistance of the assigned course instructor in
conducting their AISP at multiple points during the process, while acknowledging they
sometimes found her direction ‘confusing’ and, even more interestingly, that the instructor’s
assistance did not always help them understand the process any more (or find information any
more efficiently), was of particular interest to this researcher. Indeed, it seems from what was
related by participants in terms of the ‘why’ of continually seeking out the instructor’s
assistance, was an appreciation for the instructor’s willingness to assist students as they engaged
in the process and completed their projects.
Through commentary provided by participants, the instructor’s continual willingness to
consult with them during the AISP experience seems to have shown participants that the
instructor had a vested interest in their success, and appeared to be the primary motivating factor
for their continual return—positive outcomes (or lack thereof) aside. Additionally, that two of
the participants indicated relying on their mothers for assistance in completing their tasks
(hearkening back to the information on personal information systems and cognitive authorities
[Wilson, 1983; 1977] provided in Chapter 2) is also telling in this domain. This researcher
surmises that when participants in the study felt supported in their AISP tasks, their general
feeling of academic hopelessness was temporarily diminished. However, as was apparent in
discussions about anticipated outcomes for the final assignment and for the course as a whole,

148
this general feeling returned when participants talked about the uncertainty they felt regarding
their final assignment, and the anxiety they felt about future courses.
This researcher reasserts that although the role of emotions like anxiety on the AISP
experience of undergraduate students in general has been explored at length in previous
literature, that the remedial undergraduate student AISP experience is vastly unexplored.
Therefore, prior to this study this researcher had no idea of the role emotions like anxiety might
play in the AISP experience of participants, although she surmised it would be present (as
explained in the Epoché included in Appendix F). However, that emotions like anxiety,
frustration, and confusion negatively affected the AISP experience for participants was just the
tip of the study findings iceberg for this researcher. As explained above, what emerged most
strongly through final analysis and has been detailed at length in this section was the overarching
sense of academic hopelessness of participants, both in how they explained and described their
AISP experience, and in how they talked about their academic progress beyond the course in
which this study was housed. It is reiterated here that it is this finding that this researcher puts
forth may be one of the most valuable contributions of this study to both the library and
information science and the remedial education literature. Additionally, it is this finding this
researcher believes firmly is worthy of continued exploration in future studies.
Researcher review of AISP experience artifacts
As the discussion provided above is limited to information which answers the research
question posed earlier in this dissertation, this next discussion point explains this researcher’s
final submission review observations and is separate from the response to the research question.
However, as explained earlier, although this researcher could not separate herself from her
observations of participants’ performance in their final research assignments, she could separate

149
these observations from the exhaustive description of the AISP experience of participants.
Therefore, final submission review observations are discussed here.
Of the six participants in this study, four of them included some evidence within their
assignments of the information retrieved during the AISP, conducted to complete the assignment.
For these four, this inclusion was appropriate in spirit, but incorrect in practice, as all four failed
to adhere to the assignment-required MLA citation of information style, both in terms of in-text
citations and quotations and in listing sources used at the end of the paper as well. Although it is
clear that these four participants did not meet all the requirements for the final assignment, it is
also clear that they were able to understand the overall role the AISP experience played in that
final assignment, and include their AISP results in their final assignments in some way. The
other two participants showed no evidence of the use of AISP results in their final assignments,
therefore this researcher concludes that these participants were unable to translate the purpose of
the AISP into practice.
Lastly for this chapter, this researcher will discuss briefly how study findings correlate to
theories described within the conceptual framework presented in Chapter 2.
Mapping study findings to the conceptual framework
As described in Chapter 3, determining this study’s conceptual framework and this
researcher’s creation of the theoretical model of the AISP of the Millennial undergraduate
student constituted a crucial pre-study reflexive exercise. This was undertaken so that this
researcher could approach the research field with as clear and ‘unsullied’ a perspective of the
AISP experience as possible, and be keenly aware of what participants related to the researcher
in terms of their descriptions and explanations of the AISP experience. It is telling, therefore,
that many of the same factors present in some of the framework’s theories were also present

150
within the AISP experience as explained and described by research participants, although some
critical differences did occur, as shall be explored in Chapter 5.
The review of literature examining the AISP experience for different groups of
undergraduate students provided in Chapter 2 revealed that emotions like uncertainty, anxiety,
and frustration could play a role in participants’ AISP experience. Specifically, research studies
examining academic information-seeking, such as those conducted by Gross and Latham (2007),
Jerabek et al. (2001), Jiao et al. (2004; 1996), Kwon (2008) and Kwon et al. (2007), Malvasi et
al. (2009), Onwuegbuzie et al. (2004), and Van Kampen (2004), revealed that these emotions
negatively impacted participants’ experience. Perhaps one of the most well-regarded lines of
inquiry into the role of emotion on information-seeking by undergraduate students is that created
and built upon by Kuhlthau (1991; 1987), which was included in this researcher’s conceptual
framework because of its insight and contributed value to the research in this area. Additionally,
participants in earlier research studies by Dervin (1999; 1998; 1983; and with Nilan in 1986),
Williamson (2005), (P.) Wilson (1983; 1977) (T.D.) Wilson (1999), and many others discussed
in Chapter 2 indicated that emotions related to the AISP experience were significant (and often
negative) factors in their overall information-seeking experiences.
As required of descriptive phenomenological analysis, this researcher noted prior to the
study that she believed emotion was a significant factor in the information search process
because of previous study findings, and attempted to remove this bias from her research lens as
much as possible throughout the study (please see the Epoché in Appendix F). Nonetheless, as
emerged during analysis of this study’s data, findings revealed the AISP experience of study
participants was impacted by emotions like anxiety and uncertainty in a variety of ways. Indeed,
participants explained and described many instances where emotion (particularly negative

151
emotions like anxiety, confusion, and frustration) influenced their undertaking of AISP tasks
significantly. Additionally, as explored within the emergent themes presented earlier in this
chapter, other elements such as the role ‘cognitive authorities’ (e.g. the course instructor and, in
the case of two participants, their mothers) played in the overall AISP experience, and the
ecological factors outside of the experience which nonetheless influenced it also affected the way
the AISP experience was explained and described by participants. To that end, how emergent
themes from study findings map to the conceptual framework of the study presented in Chapter 2
is presented next.
Blair’s (1990) “Point of Futility” and Wilson’s (1983; 1977) Personal Information Systems and
Cognitive Authority theories
In summation of the major points discussed under this heading in Chapter 2, Blair (1990)
found that users of information retrieval (IR) systems could reach a mathematically calculable
‘futility point,’ determined by including variables such as the amount and variance of search
terms used within a search in an IR system, and the amount and relevance of results retrieved by
the IR system in response to a user’s information request. This futility point is an information
point of no return, and often signifies an abandonment of the user’s information search.
Wilson’s (1983, 1977) work explored the concept of a personal information system (PIS), a
three-tiered information system through which most people acquire information that informs,
supports, and guides them in regard to how they live their lives. This system is comprised
primarily of cognitive authority sources, those sources which a person has deemed essential to
the provision of information to meet the needs of one of the three tiers in their information
system. Many of a person’s cognitive authority sources are incorporated in their early life, and
often include close family members and/or respected peers. When change is suggested to either

152
a cognitive authority source or a personal information system as a whole, either due to a failure
to ‘perform,’ or a change in worldview, anxiety and mental trauma often results.
As shown in this study’s research findings, the early work of Blair (1990) and Wilson
(1983; 1977) can be seen in the description and explanation of participants’ AISP experience.
Notably, this includes a) anxiety and confusion expressed by participants in terms of how to
implement search processes within academic databases (or IR systems) and a feeling of futility
resulting from the failure to find any appropriate information, or a feeling of being overwhelmed
when finding too much information, b) recognition of the importance of identified cognitive
authority sources in helping participants complete AISP tasks—sources such as writing support
services, the library, and, as was the case for two participants, their mothers, and c) the
disappointment some participants felt when a cognitive authority source let them down (e.g. the
‘wrong advice’ provided to one participant by campus writing support service staff, and the
confusion some participants felt after seeking AISP assistance from the course instructor).
These correlations indicate that a future research project examining remedial
undergraduate student information behaviors within the context of work by Blair (1990) and
Wilson (1983; 1977) may be worthwhile and highly informative.
Kuhlthau’s (1991) Information Search Process (ISP) Model
Of all the elements presented in Kuhlthau’s (1991) ISP model, the few which were seen
the most within this study’s findings were a) the non-linear AISP experiences relayed by
participants during interviews, and observed in situ by this researcher during lab days, b) the
challenges participants encountered in formulating fully their information needs for the final
assignment before engaging in AISP tasks, and c) the limiting emotions of anxiety, uncertainty,
and frustration participants exhibited throughout the AISP experience.

153
Again, examining the impact of emotions like uncertainty and anxiety on remedial
undergraduate student information behavior may inform and build upon the foundational ISP
work of Kuhlthau (1991) in future research.
Williamson’s (2005) Ecological Theory of Human Information Behavior
As stated in the description of Williamson’s (2005) ecological theory in Chapter 2, and
repeated here, Williamson (2005) put forth that one cannot understand a person’s information
needs unless they understand that person’s “ecological framework” (p. 130). Indeed, this
researcher observed firsthand the role ecological factors played on the AISP experience as
described and explained by research participants. Factors such as participants’ perspectives of
the usefulness of the course to their overall academic experience, their feelings and emotions
concerned the class as a whole, and the roles played by previous college experiences (and
previous experiences with this course specifically, for those who were taking it for a second
time, having failed it previously) all had tangible influences on the relation of participant’s AISP
experiences to this researcher, particularly their positive and negative emotions and sentiments
toward the AISP experience and its impact on their final grades.
This researcher asserts that much can be learned about the remedial undergraduate
student experience by examining the impact of ecological factors on their experiences, and this
researcher would like to explore this line of inquiry in future research.
Summary of study findings, conclusions, implications for practitioners, and suggestions
for future research will be discussed in Chapter 5—the concluding chapter of this dissertation.

154
Chapter V
Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Introduction
From the very beginning of this researcher’s doctoral program when the study described
herein was still a kernel of an idea, it was her intention to pursue a line of inquiry that would
increase her awareness for how academically at-risk undergraduate students (like those in
remedial courses) find, use, and understand the incorporation of information for academic
pursuits. As discussed previously, this researcher’s professional experiences with and
observations of similarly defined groups of students led her to believe that they were not without
promising and malleable ability—in terms of information literacy, or in terms of their
educational pursuits as a whole. Indeed, what this researcher had observed was missing from
their academic experiences was not ability, but skill. Most notably, many students this
researcher encountered appeared to lack the information literacy skills that would help them
complete academic assignments appropriately, and did not recognize that acquiring these skills
would assist them in both completing academic assignments, and progressing academically.
As stated in the Chapter 1, research shows that a student’s strong information literacy
skills are positively correlated with his or her implementation of a strong academic information
search process (AISP) (Boon, Johnston, & Webber, 2007), and further, that a strong AISP is
“intertwined” (Salisbury and Karasmanis, 2011, p. 43) with a student’s learning in general. As
the AISP experience described and explained by remedial undergraduate student study
participants indicated, most believed that knowing more about conducting an appropriate AISP
would help them succeed in future academic efforts. Additionally, those participants who
indicated having the most trouble finding information during their AISPs to meet the

155
requirements of the final assignment were the same participants who failed to produce any
evidence of AISP findings in their final assignments (researcher observation review comments of
participants’ final submissions were included in the “Discussion” section in Chapter 4). Finally,
these same participants also shared feelings of hopelessness and concern for their academic
performance beyond the course in which the study was housed, particularly because both
participants had already failed the current course once. As shared in the discussion in Chapter 4,
it is this latter finding that most concerns this researcher, and which she asserts is perhaps the
most significant contribution this study makes to the gap in the literature regarding the
information needs and behaviors of remedial undergraduate students. The summary of this
dissertation study’s findings is presented next.
Summary of findings
Because the findings of this study were detailed specifically and contextually in Chapter
4, this section shall present this researcher’s brief summary of how the study findings described
in this dissertation compare to and contrast with the research currently available on the AISP
experience of undergraduate students.
As discussed in Chapter 4, the AISP experience of study participants was explained and
described by them to be a complex and multi-faceted entity that is a) affected directly by internal
elements related to the experience, b) impacted indirectly by external elements related to the
experience, and c) influenced by ecological factors outside of the immediate experience. These
findings are similar to those of other research studies investigating academic information-seeking
of undergraduate students. However, this researcher asserts that the way these effects, impacts,
and influences shaped the AISP experience of participants contributes broader insight into the
experience for those working with remedial undergraduate students, and therefore supports the

156
importance of this study’s contribution to literature in the library and information science and
remedial education fields.
Despite previous literature discussing the role of emotion on academic informationseeking for undergraduate students, new insight into this area for this researcher is the influence
that a general sense of academic hopelessness has on remedial undergraduate students, as
explored in “Discussion” in Chapter 4. Specifically, that academic hopelessness affects a) how
these students engage in learning tasks like conducting AISPs, b) how and who they ask for
assistance (and whether or not they believe that assistance helps or hurts them in the long run),
and c) their feelings and emotions related to learning tasks like AISPs, and their learning
experiences as a whole, was illuminating. Additionally, that satisficing behavior was exhibited
by participants in this study in tandem with emotional ebbs and flows during the AISP, connects
with what has been published regarding the rationale behind satisficing in undergraduate student
information-seeking. Specifically, as described by Becker, 2003; Nicholas et al, 2009; Prabha et
al., 2007; Vakkari, 2005; and Warwick et al., 2009, satisficing is a method implemented by
information seekers to reduce anxiety, and is emblematic of the high levels of information
anxiety some students experience during the AISP process. This concept is represented quite
poignantly through the quote of the participant who resorted to conducting a Google search when
her academic research database searching failed to produce results: “Even if I find a little
information, I still have information.”
Also interesting to this researcher was the fact that instructor assistance and instruction in
regard to the AISP had a significant impact on the way participants explained and described their
experience, as discussed in Chapter 4. Finally, that ecological factors like participant
perspectives on the overall nature of course instruction, their feelings and emotions related to the

157
course overall, and their previous experiences, either with this particular class or with higher
education in total, influenced profoundly how students explained and described their AISP
experience, reflects tangible connections to the research examining human information behavior
performed by Williamson (2005), and which was included within this researcher’s conceptual
framework presented in Chapter 2.
How these findings influence what this researcher now knows about the AISP experience
and what findings say about the current state of associated research will be discussed next.
Conclusions
This section will discuss those particular study findings that were completely beyond this
researcher’s understanding or comprehension of the AISP experience prior to entering the
research field and indeed, prior to concluding this dissertation.
These findings include:
a) The concept of ‘academic hopelessness’ as experienced by research participants
and which revealed itself during synthesis of analysis results, which revealed
itself to not only impact participants’ their AISP experience as explored in the
study, but also their self-reported predictions of their performance in future
academic work,
b) The role seeking the assistance of support services (instructor, out-of-class, and,
in the case of two participants, their mothers) played in how participants
proceeded with their AISPs, whether they believed that assistance increased their
understanding of the overall process or not, and

158
c) The influence of ecological factors on participants’ related AISP experience and
their attitudes toward academic information-seeking in general, and how these
factors framed their mental and emotional processes as part of the AISP itself.
Exploring the impact of academic hopelessness on participants’ AISP experience
As discussed in Chapter 4, during analysis this researcher began to identify specific
statements within each of the categories and within the broader emergent themes of the
experience which suggested that participants’ AISP experience was affected by more than their
motivation to learn about the process and complete assignment requirements. Indeed, included
within participant descriptions of how they conducted their AISP to meet final assignment
requirements were statements like “I feel I could get a good grade but it’s a toss-up,” “time is
working against us now,” “you think you’re going to get the help you need and then you ask for
help and it’s completely confusing,” “it was kind of overwhelming because there were so many
things to learn,” “you don’t always know what to do with this,” and “I feel like a tire stuck in the
mud – I’m trying and trying and not getting anywhere.”
Although most of the participants in the study indicated that they were not particularly
motivated to learn a great deal about how to conduct an AISP to complete their final assignment
and believed that their current skills in the area of academic information-seeking were sufficient
to fulfill the requirements of the final assignment for the course, this researcher ‘saw’ in their
explanations a greater sense of academic hopelessness, which emerged as a finding of the study
naturally and completely separate from this researcher’s understanding of the experience.
Because some of the study’s participants had already taken and failed this course once, this
researcher observed during their in-lab AISP tasks and in their descriptions of the information

159
they found to include in the final assignment that most felt what they were doing would leave
them in no better academic position once the course in which this study was housed ended.
As this researcher indicated in Chapter 4, it is clear that there was significant
misunderstanding of final assignment requirements and therefore none of the six participants
completed the assignment according to requirements. However, as this researcher also observed
during in-lab AISP tasks conducted by students, these students displayed a fairly stable range of
information literacy abilities which, with the introduction of more skills-based instruction (as
detailed in this researcher’s bracketing notes), could be strengthened and assist them in
conducting stronger and more efficient AISPs to meet the requirements of future assignments.
This researcher discussed previously in this dissertation that she believed remedial
undergraduate students were not without the ability to learn appropriate information literacy
skills. However, as observed over the course of this study, this researcher asserts that it is the
strength of these skills that currently impedes participants’ appropriate academic implementation
of things like AISP procedures. In her article exploring the impact of low-level skills on
academic information-seeking behavior, Gross (2005) asserts that competency theory explains a
great deal of this behavior in students’ implementation. Specifically, Gross’ (2005) competency
theory predicts that “individuals with low levels of information-seeking skills would be unlikely
to seek training or assistance when faced with an information-seeking task and would tend to be
satisfied with their own (low-level) performance” (p. 155). Although this researcher concedes
Gross’s (2005) theory could explain how some students operate in this area, as her observations
with the participants in the study show, competency theory does not adequately explain the
impact that academic hopelessness has on participants’ low-level information-seeking behavior.
As will be explained further in the next section, most participants in this study recognized their

160
lack of skill in the AISP experience as a whole and sought out assistance with same through
multiple sources. However, most participants in this study expressed that these sources did
nothing to ‘help’ them, and therefore these sources failed to counter participants’ underlying
sense of academic hopelessness—the prevailing feeling that they were “tires stuck in the
academic mud” of their remedial status.
This researcher asserts that knowing more about the sense of academic hopelessness as it
is experienced by remedial undergraduate students is paramount for educators of these students.
This is because study findings revealed that this sense had a profound effect on participants’
mental processes as they related to learning skills for tasks like AISPs, and on their general
academic outlook beyond the course in which the study was housed. Indeed, whether it is
increasing their information literacy skills or their academic skills as a whole, it is put forth here
that remedial undergraduate students will not be able to move beyond the institutionally
designated idea of ‘being remedial’ without intervention which helps them tackle their internal
sense of academic hopelessness.
During an international conference at which this researcher presented in August, 2014,
eminent scholar in library and information science field, Michael Buckland, suggested that this
researcher’s dissertation study findings could be used to develop critical motivation theory as it
relates to remedial undergraduate student information behavior (personal communication,
Michael Buckland, August 9, 2014). The development of such a theory could be crucial in
understanding how motivation impacts remedial undergraduate students’ sense of academic
hopelessness, and vice versa. More on how this could be explored by this researcher and others
will be discussed in the ‘Suggestions for future research’ section later in this chapter.

161
Exploring the facets related to support service assistance for the AISP
As discussed in the previous section, the finding related to participants’ use of support
service assistance to complete their final assignment (and learn more about the AISP) contradicts
Gross’ (2005) premise behind competency theory. Indeed, as shared by participants in the study,
not only did most of them know their AISP skills were not ‘up to snuff’ to complete the final
assignment, but most of them also acknowledged that learning more about the process was
critical for their success in future academic work. Verbatim quotes such as “This is not a
pointless assignment – I think it will be helpful down the road,” “[the final assignment’ helped
me better understand what to do in the future,” and “It’s a longer process … I’m not comfortable
with it right now and I’m sure I have more to learn about it” indicate that most participants
appreciated the long-term reasons and benefits for learning how to conduct and AISP, and
therefore did their best to learn the extent of its implementation in the course.
To this researcher, these statements seemed contradictory to statements the same
participants made regarding their lack of motivation to learn everything they could about the
AISP to complete final assignment requirements, and their relayed feelings of confusion and
frustration with the process as a whole. However, a possible explanation for these contradictory
statements emerged as this researcher processed the data concerning participant requests for
assistance from the course instructor, and from external support services.
When asked where they may go for assistance regarding learning more about the AISP
beyond this course, a few of the participants shared that they felt the writing support service and
perhaps the library could assist them in learning more about conducting the AISP as a whole.
However, these statements were made hesitantly, as if they were unsure whether or not this was
the case. For one participant, the assistance he received from the writing support service was
more of a hindrance to his understanding of conducting an AISP than a help. The participant

162
explained he had sought the assistance of staff in the writing support service when enrolled in
this course previously, and that “it was a big failure. I don’t know if I would go back to them
again [because] they gave the wrong advice.” The participant also explained that when he shared
the details of his experience with the staff at the writing support service with the previous
course’s instructor, the instructor validated his concerns about the “failure” of the writing support
service staff to help, and told the participant he did not need to return to the writing support
service for further assistance.
That these participants are willing to seek external support for their academic needs and
have such negative experiences is greatly troubling to this researcher. Furthermore, that
participants suggest support resources may be useful to them in the future, but are not sure
whether these support services can actually help them, indicates to this researcher that there is a
definite communication breakdown between the needs of remedial undergraduate students, and
the ways support services can and do assist them. That these participants despite expressed
feelings of academic hopelessness seek assistance and then have such negative encounters is
considered by this researcher to be unacceptable.
Tellingly, that participants who sought out the assistance of the course’s instructor in
completing their final assignments felt similarly confused after assistance was received is also
troubling. As one participant shared, “Asking for teacher’s help can confuse you more at times –
make you feel more lost.” Therefore this researcher asserts that the same disconnect participants
expressed exists between the needs which drove them to seek external support and the nature of
the external support they received, also exists between the assistance provided by the instructor
in terms of conducting the AISP, and its effectiveness (or lack thereof) in clarifying expectations
for participants and helping them conduct their AISPs. This finding is somewhat validating for

163
this researcher in that it supports her supposition that information literacy instruction as a whole
is ineffective if what is taught is only what the instructor believes should be taught, and it is not
responsive to the expressed needs of students (as explained and described by participants in this
dissertation study). More on the implications this finding has for practitioners and targeted
information literacy instruction will be discussed in the ‘Implications’ section in this chapter.
Exploring the influence of ecological factors on participants’ AISP experience (and their
predicted academic outlook)
As the categories included under the emergent ‘Ecological factors’ theme imply, there are
three areas surrounding the AISP that had bearing on the way participants explained and
described their overall experience. These are a) participants’ general perspectives on course
instruction, b) participants’ feelings and emotions related to the course overall, and c) how
previous experiences with this course (for those who had failed it before) and with their higher
education experience to date influenced their current understanding and implementation of the
AISP to meet final assignment requirements. Indeed, as was suggested by Williamson (2005),
understanding a person’s information behavior extends beyond an exploration of the behavior
itself. The influence ecological factors have on this behavior must be examined, as well, in order
for someone to understand the true extent of the experience.
Williamson’s (2005) supposition (as explained in Chapter 4) is born out in the further
exploration of this particular finding. It is also extended by the specifics of the influence the
three ecological factors shared above, had on how participants explained and described their
AISP experience. Particularly, most participants felt that having to navigate the instructional
style of a new instructor of the course (if they had taken the course previously) increased their
anxiety as they struggled to learn about AISP tasks, and how the information retrieved from
these tasks could be used to meet the requirements of the final assignment. Additionally,

164
competing assignments in the course in which this study was housed (e.g. learning more about
the mechanics of scholarly writing) quickly frustrated participants, as they found these
assignments to be overwhelming and voluminous and, as expressed under the ‘previous
course/college experience category,’ limited their ability to complete competing assignments in
other courses, as well. This frustration and anxiety spilled over into their AISP experience for
many participants, particularly those who felt that instructions for conducting an AISP received
in the current course were ineffective in helping them complete the AISP.
The verbatim quote from the participant who explained that “[the instructor] just throws
us in the computer lab and I don’t know what we’re supposed to do” characterizes this shared
frustration quite succinctly for this researcher, as does another participant’s expressed sentiment
that although he believed the class as a whole was helpful to his continued academic progress,
that certain class requirements (such as grammar revision) negatively affected his performance.
Indeed, this same participant was doubtful that his performance in the class to date would make
any difference to the outcome: “I hope I pass this class by some miracle.” Finally, even the
participant who seemed the most engaged in the course as a whole, and in the AISP experience
particularly, indicated that she felt overwhelmed when conducting the AISP to meet the
requirements of the final assignment, and indicated that she would probably feel overwhelmed
again when tasked with completing an AISP in future courses. Therefore this researcher asserts
that for remedial undergraduate students, ecological factors (like those shared above) which
surround their AISP experience may negatively impact their ability to complete AISPs
successfully, and in an even more profound way than their college-ready peers. Such exploration
is therefore rife with opportunity in future research.

165
The findings shared above and how they have broadened this researcher’s understanding
of the AISP experience of participants and the larger role this experience plays in their predicted
academic outlook have greatly influenced this researcher’s future research direction (as shall be
described in the ‘Suggestions for future research’ section of this chapter). Additionally, this
researcher asserts that these findings have great bearing on the way professionals in library and
information science and remedial education should create and implement future information
literacy instruction provided to these students, and the implications such instruction might have
for their continued academic progress. The implications these findings suggest for the latter area
shall be discussed next.
Implications for practitioners and for targeted information literacy instruction
On October 6, 2014, this researcher was fortunate to attend a seminar presented by Ken
Bain, author of the What the best college teachers do, and self-proclaimed scholar of effective
practices in higher education instructional methods from around the world. During this seminar,
Bain shared that many students do not succeed in higher education because they are not
motivated to do so because of a variety of factors (Bain, 2014). As this researcher had seen the
evidence of the deleterious effects of a lack of motivation on student academic performance in
her own teaching experiences, she was particularly interested in what Bain (2014) shared about
motivating unmotivated students. Particularly, Bain (2014) said that for demotivated students to
become motivated, instructors need to convince them of three things:
1.

Students need to believe that what they are learning has a greater purpose, and
that it has calculable relevance to their continued performance in academic study,

2.

Students need to believe they can do what is asked of them by the instructor, and
must be given the ability to practice skills/requirements introduced in a course in

166
an ungraded environment first, before being asked to submit evidence of learning
of the skill/requirement for a grade, and finally,
3.

Students need to feel a deep sense of autonomy and control over their own
educational experiences.

For this researcher, Bain’s (2014) statements regarding how to motivate students were
illuminating. Particularly, the statement this researcher found the most compelling was the one
which related to a student’s creation of a deep sense of autonomy and sense of control in terms of
their own educational experiences. In previous conversations with remedial undergraduate
students during academic advising appointments, this researcher learned that these students felt
like much of their educational future was out of their control, and to them, this was incredibly
disheartening and discouraging. Similarly, as findings explored previously in this chapter
exhibited, participants in the study described in this dissertation expressed a sense of academic
hopelessness in their descriptions of their AISP experience, and in relation to their studies as a
whole. Further, most participants described encountering negative experiences when seeking
assistance to complete their AISPs, having negative emotions related to conducting the AISP
because of various ecological factors, and significant feelings of frustration, confusion, being
overwhelmed, and, in the case of one participant, stupidity, which occurred during the AISP
experience, and in tandem with their experience with the course as a whole.
As already stated in this dissertation, this researcher supports the idea that collaborative
partnerships between remedial educators and library and information science professionals are
highly necessary when providing information literacy instruction. This is because the
pedagogical ‘fruits’ of these collaborations often lend themselves to contextual integration of
said instruction into coursework. Additionally, these collaborations can produce more well-

167
rounded and, most critically, directly applicable information literacy instruction to students (as
discussed in the plethora of literature presented in Chapter 2, regarding the benefits of
collaborative information literacy instruction to instructors and students, alike).
However, it is the reality that such collaborations are not common-place, for a variety of
reasons, as stated in the discussion when reviewing the research in this area in Chapter 2. In an
intellectual summation of two of the primary reasons behind lack of collaborations between
undergraduate faculty members and academic librarians, Badke (2010) shares:
a) Not only is there a misunderstanding on behalf of many faculty members that
technological proficiency equates to information literacy proficiency (and
therefore, they believe evidence of technological proficiency in their students is
also evidence of the proficiency with information literacy skills), but also,
b) (As was also discussed in Breivik and Gee, 2006), “faculty pedagogy seeks to
maintain control of the classroom, thus making it difficult for librarians to
encroach into faculty held territory” (Badke, 2010, p. 137), despite evidence
provided by researchers like Smith & Dailey (2013) that such partnerships often
have positive outcomes for students, instructors, and librarians.
This researcher asserts that her findings support the need for collaborative information
literacy instruction now more than ever, particularly in terms of the specific information literacy
instruction delivered to remedial undergraduate students. As participants in the study shared,
they were so unclear on AISP procedures and how the outcomes of the AISP factored into the
requirements for the final assignment that it caused them a great deal of confusion, particularly
when instructor assistance in this area provided no more clarity on what was required.

168
In reiterating the second of Bain’s (2014) statements from the opening of this section, this
researcher speculates that participants in the study may have been demotivated to learn more
about how to conduct an AISP within the confines of the course, because the results of in-lab
AISP tasks (as observed by this researcher) were often less than fruitful. More frustratingly for
the students, those that sought the guidance of the instructor in improving their chances to find
information through AISP tasks were often disappointed, especially when the instructor could
not explain to participants why her suggested AISP strategies did not work. Had a collaborative
lecture discussing how to conduct an AISP and subsequent hands-on tutorial been delivered
jointly by the instructor and an academic librarian, it is possible that the hands-on assistance
portion of the participants’ related AISP experience alone may have been dramatically different.
As explored in the literature on this area presented in Chapter 2, and reiterated by Weller
Swanson (2014) in the published volume exploring the many merits of multidisciplinary
collaborations between faculty and librarians, these collaborative partnerships are effective in
helping students understand AISPs specifically, because the skills are taught contextually
(meeting the objectives of the faculty member in completing assignments), and in tangible ways
(through the guidance of library research authorities). Therefore, this researcher asserts that one
of the major implications of study findings for practitioners and for targeted information literacy
instruction delivered to remedial undergraduate students is that future instruction should involve
collaborative partnerships as much as possible, to more appropriately meet the needs of these
students. Integrating the premise of Bain’s (2014) first statement, then, into this argument, this
researcher asserts that remedial undergraduate students will gain a much broader appreciation for
the greater purpose and continued relevance of academic information-seeking if information
literacy skills are taught contextually in their courses. Additionally, if these skills are taught in

169
tandem with assignment requirements, and explained by those with the means to expand upon
the ‘continued relevance’ aspect of scholarly research, then remedial undergraduate students will
have a greater chance of understanding its utility overall. Collaborative partnerships are an ideal
environment for creating such conditions, and this researcher reasserts her supposition that study
findings imply more consideration for such partnerships should be given by both library and
information science professionals, and by remedial educators.
To conclude this section, this researcher returns to the third statement made by Bain
(2014) stated at the beginning of this section: that students need to feel a deep sense of autonomy
and control over their own educational experiences. Indeed, it is this statement that resonated
most with this researcher, as the underlying sense of academic hopelessness in study participants
had already started to emerge during the data analysis process of her study at the time.
Additionally, that much of this hopelessness was seated in the lack of control participants
expressed dominated their course experience, allowed this researcher to appreciate that perhaps
the best way to overcome participants’ described lack of control was to give control of their
educational experiences back to them. This follows with Bain’s line of reasoning by restoring
their sense of educational autonomy.
To that end, this researcher asserts that these study findings imply that if targeted
information literacy instruction is to be effective for remedial undergraduate students, it must
fulfill two criteria:
1.

It must be multimodal (i.e. it must be provided to students in a variety of
pedagogical formats, and through a variety of instructional modes, e.g. in person,
online, etc.), so that students can ‘select’ different information literacy instruction
elements based on their learning needs for the particular instructional task, and

170
2.

It must restore a sense of control and autonomy to the student, indeed, it may even
be self-instructed.

In her book describing best practices for helping remedial undergraduate students
succeed academically, Rollins (2014) explains that both educators and administrators in higher
education may be incredibly reluctant to give these students control over their own learning.
Specifically, she explains that their observation of the issues these students face (such as
“smaller vocabularies, lower reading levels, and gaps in basic skills,” Rollins, 2014, p. 95) may
make the idea of student control of learning seem ludicrous. To compensate for these observed
‘deficiencies,’ “the tendency may be, rather to assign [remedial undergraduate students] more
individual seatwork—to give them lower-level work that they can handle” (Rollins, 2014, p. 95).
However, as Rollins (2014) explains, “already-frustrated students and tedium do not mix well,”
(p. 95), and further, that “struggling students may have poor self-esteem and hold low
expectations for themselves” (p. 95), something this researcher has shown first-hand in
explaining the concept of academic hopelessness that emerged in study findings. Therefore, as
explored by numerous researchers on the topic of student-controlled learning and whose
promotion this researcher supports, a modicum of educational control given to remedial
undergraduate students may increase their sense of educational autonomy and directly combat
their feelings of academic hopelessness and consequently their dismal academic outlooks.
As put forth by Mithaug, Mithaug, Agran, Martin, & Wehmeyer (2007), proponents of
self-instruction pedagogy, “early studies suggest … that choice opportunities [such as those
provided through multimodal learning components] and self-regulation are necessary for
autonomous learning and performance in school and beyond” (p. 67). Based on this researcher’s
previous experience working with remedial undergraduate students in information literacy

171
instruction sessions, and based on all she has seen through the findings of this study, she believes
firmly that multimodal, autonomous information literacy instruction delivered in collaborative
partnership (with instructors, librarians, and other external support services as appropriate) will
be the most successful means to help remedial undergraduate students develop strong
information literacy skills. This researcher asserts that the need for change in current
information literacy instruction of remedial undergraduate students, as expressed by participants,
constitutes the most pressing implication of her study findings. This researcher also believes that
the necessary change should come in the form of multimodal, collaborative instruction, which
helps to restore remedial undergraduate students’ sense of educational autonomy, and aids them
in overcoming the limitations imposed on their mental and academic progress by their sense of
academic hopelessness.
The next section explores additional suggestions for future research endeavors which
may aid both library and information science and remedial education professionals in more
broadly meeting the information needs of remedial undergraduate students.
Recommendations for future research
Because suggested future lines of inquiry, for both this researcher and for others in the
field of library and information science and remedial undergraduate education, are sprinkled
liberally throughout this chapter, they shall be discussed in summative form herein.
How academic hopelessness impacts information behavior and future academic performance
The first suggestion comes from the concept explored earlier in this chapter, which was
noted as one of the more critical findings of this researcher’s dissertation study: The impact of
the concept of academic hopelessness on the information behaviors and future academic
performance of remedial undergraduate students. Indeed, as discussed in the ‘Summary of

172
findings’ and ‘Conclusions’ sections of this chapter, participants in this researcher’s study
revealed that academic hopelessness was a major factor in their AISP experience specifically, but
also in their predictions for their own academic futures.
As discussed previously, academic hopelessness appeared to negatively impact
participants’ self-reported, predicted future academic performance quite significantly. Therefore,
this makes it plain for this researcher that investigation into how its influence can be limited on
remedial undergraduate students’ academic information-seeking behaviors is only the first step
in this line of inquiry. Indeed, this researcher asserts that more library and information science
professionals and remedial educators should investigate the impact of academic hopelessness on
remedial undergraduate students’ academic experiences as a whole. If it bears out that academic
hopelessness is one of the biggest impediments to these students’ abilities to persist toward
graduation, then those invested in the academic success of these students must determine how it
can be minimized or perhaps even eliminated, in order to more appropriately navigate these
students through their programs of study.
Effective instructional support for remedial undergraduate student information tasks
The second suggestion involves further exploration into what constitutes effective
instructional support for students completing information tasks, such as an AISP. As discussed
previously, participants in the study were very motivated to seek assistance that would help them
complete the final assignment for the course, and that would help them learn more about
conducting the AISP. However, as shared through the verbatim quotes provided, this instruction
(both external and internal to the course) appeared to do more harm than good. Now that this
study has provided a foundational understanding of how remedial undergraduate students
experience academic information-seeking, this researcher hypothesizes that further exploration

173
into how support services can best meet the needs of these students is crucial in aiding the
development of strong information literacy skills, and consequently enhancing their continued
academic progress as they persist toward graduation.
Blair (1990), Wilson (1983; 1977), and the remedial undergraduate student
The third suggestion was explored briefly in Chapter 4: An examination of how remedial
undergraduate student information behaviors as a whole are affected by a) their interactions with
information retrieved from academic research databases (a la the work established by Blair,
1990), and b) the cognitive authorities that form their personal information systems (a la Wilson,
1983; 1977). Specifically, this researcher surmises that an investigation into how cognitive
authorities shape a remedial undergraduate student’s understanding of the role academic
information plays in their overall academic progress would be illuminating to library and
information science professionals, particularly in how they work with students at various stages
of their programs of study. As discussed previously, two participants in this study regularly
consulted their mothers for assistance with their academic information-seeking and scholarly
writing, noting that they did so because their mothers had advanced degrees and they believed
therefore their mothers could provide them with a high level of assistance. This shows that the
role of cognitive authorities in the information behaviors of these students are highly valued and
respected. How this respect and value for guidance provided by cognitive authorities could be
harnessed in the higher education environment is certainly worthy of future research.
The influence of ecological factors on remedial undergraduate student information behaviors
The fourth suggestion involves further exploration into the specific influence that
ecological factors have on the general academic behaviors of remedial undergraduate students.
As discussed in the ‘Conclusions’ section of this chapter, this researcher asserts that much can be

174
learned about the remedial undergraduate student academic experience by examining the impact
of ecological factors on these experiences. For library and information science professionals
specifically, examining how ecological factors inform the way remedial undergraduate students
perform information tasks (such as academic information-seeking and the incorporation of
scholarly information into academic assignments) will give these professionals greater insight
into the ways and means these factors can be either built upon or countered, depending on
whether the overarching influence of these factors is positive or negative. This researcher
particularly would like to pursue this line of inquiry in her current position as an instructional
design librarian for the University of Akron, as she believes it will greatly inform the
development of instructional components for the various embedded librarian programs currently
underway in freshmen courses.
The impact of emotion on remedial undergraduate student information behavior
The final suggestion drawn from findings in this dissertation involves the
recommendation for further study, by this researcher and others, into the impact of emotions like
uncertainty and anxiety on remedial undergraduate student information behavior. This research
could build upon the foundational ISP work of Kuhlthau (1991), but it could also be expanded
far beyond Kuhlthau’s (1991; 1987) work. Indeed, such research could incorporate what is now
known about the impact of particular emotions like frustration and confusion on information
tasks, building upon the findings of the study shared in this dissertation. Also, this line of
inquiry could be expanded to include consideration of findings from those research studies
exploring the effects of information anxiety on the information behavior of undergraduate
students, as was discussed in Chapter 2. This researcher intends to engage in such research
herself because of how crucial she believes a greater understanding of these emotions will be to

175
the library and information science field as a whole. Therefore, a potential next step in her
research agenda is the creation of a quantitative instrument (similar to the adapted Library
Anxiety instrument used in the study described in Blundell & Lambert, 2014) which can more
broadly assess the particular information anxieties experienced by remedial undergraduate
students, toward helping practitioners limit these anxieties and ultimately, helping remedial
undergraduate students persist toward graduation.
Final thoughts
This researcher recently discovered the following quote by Ignacio Estrada, courtesy of
one of her greatest ‘cognitive authorities’ (her mother): “If a child can’t learn the way we teach,
maybe we should teach the way they learn.”
Although this researcher does not consider the remedial undergraduate student
participants of her study to be children, she does find the quote to be illuminating to her deeper
understanding of their AISP experience as a whole. As stated previously, findings from this
study indicated that one of the biggest frustrations shared by study participants in the relation of
their AISP experience was the way they were taught to conduct the AISP. Notwithstanding that
some participants had previous experience with conducting an AISP, even these participants felt
frustrated during the experience, particularly when they sought extra assistance to complete the
AISP and consequentially found this assistance to be no more helpful in clarifying what needed
to be done that the original instruction offered during the course in which this study was housed.
At the end of this dissertation, one of the biggest take-aways for this researcher is this:
Minimal information is available on the general information experiences of remedial
undergraduate students primarily because library and information science research has
considered these experiences primarily from the perspective of practitioners, and not from the

176
perspective of participants. Indeed, as the comprehensive report of this researcher’s study has
put forth, how practitioners currently teach information literacy instruction to remedial
undergraduate students is very often at odds with the self-reported information needs of these
students. Therefore, if both library and information science professionals and remedial educators
want to be more pedagogically effective in helping remedial undergraduate students succeed,
they and this researcher as well need to do a better job of regularly asking remedial
undergraduate students what they believe their information needs to be.
In conclusion, it is asserted herein that findings from this study have created a solid
foundation upon which future research into remedial undergraduate student information
behaviors can continue to build. She plans to continue investigating best practices for teaching
remedial undergraduate students “the way they learn,” and she intends to do so by conducting
future studies that incorporate explorations of these students’ lived experiences in different areas
of their academic lives. It is her hope that practitioners in both library and information science
and remedial education will continue to explore the findings presented in this dissertation from a
number of perspectives. Most of all, this researcher hopes that at least one remedial
undergraduate student’s educational experience will be improved because of what was learned
from the experiences explained and described by participants in this study.

Informed Consent to Participate in a Research Study
Study Title: A phenomenological investigation of the information search process of
undergraduate students enrolled in a remedial English course: Implications for
targeted information literacy instruction.
Principal Investigator: Dr. Yin Zhang, School of Library and Information Science, Kent State
University
Co-investigator: Shelley Blundell, Ph.D. candidate, Communication and Information, Kent
State University
You are being invited to participate in a research study. This consent form will provide you with
information on the research project, what you will need to do, and the associated risks and
benefits of the research. Your participation is voluntary. Please read this form carefully. It is
important that you ask questions and fully understand the research in order to make an informed
decision. You will receive a copy of this document to take with you.
Purpose:

This dissertation research study seeks to find out more about the academic
information-seeking activities of students enrolled in a remedial English course as
they complete an academic assignment, toward understanding more about the
information-seeking experience of these students. Knowing more about this
process for students enrolled in remedial courses will allow educators and librarians
to work together and create targeted information instruction for these students,
addressing their actual information needs, and aiding their academic progress
through their degrees of study.

Procedures
Participants in this study will be asked to actively participate in two collection procedures, and
one follow-up meeting. The collection procedures include: 1) individual, in-class interviews,
wherein the co-researcher will ask about their information-seeking activities for the research
assignment they are completing as they look for information, and 2) keeping a journal (either
electronic, or written) of their out-of-class information-seeking activities for the assignment.
Guidelines for completing this journal will be brief, and participants are asked to make a journal
entry each time they look for information for the assignment outside of class. The researcher
will also be observing any instruction participants receive that instructs them on how to complete
the research assignment, and reviewing research assignments of participants after a grade for the
course has been submitted, to see how the information search process for the assignment
translated into the completion of the assignment itself.
The follow-up meeting will be held between the researcher and individual participants in the
study after the course has concluded. The researcher will share with each participant information

180
she has collected about their information-seeking experience, and ask the participant to examine
the information and identify whether the information is accurate in terms of relaying the
participant’s actual experience. Participants will also be asked a few follow-up questions about
their experience, toward relating their experience in research results as wholly and as accurately
as possible.
The co-researcher has no impact on course outcomes whatsoever, and no influence over any
course grading or submitted assignments.
Benefits
This research will not benefit you directly, unfortunately. However, your participation in this
study will help us to better understand specific information needs of students enrolled in
remedial coursework, toward improving the experience of students in these courses at a number
of levels. This may include informing educators and librarians on best practices when designing
instruction that specifically addresses the needs of students enrolled in remedial undergraduate
coursework.

Appendix E: Out-of-class AISP journal entries
Participant 2
Journal Entry 1
1.) I am in the computer lab of the main hall at kent stark
2.) Im very pressed for time, going to attempt to find at least four articles before I start
working on another subject. And my mind is a little scattered. I’ve been slacking the past
couple weeks and have a lot of work to catch up on. This is also my first time working on
this assignment at all, outside of class time. And people keep texting me But I’m trying to
only respond after I complete each article.
3.) For my hiddin curriculum I used the words Physical, education, teaching methods. For
my cultural artifact I looked up working class.
4.) Kents library source
5.) I feel fine no pressure or anything Just taking the time to find the articles that are out
there.
Participant 2
Journal Entry 2
1.) I am in the kent stark main hall computer lab.
2.) It’s not noisy, you can hear a few people talking and keys being pressed but that’s about
it. And I’m totally focused on this assignment right now, no distractions. No one’s texting
me, and I’m not on facebook. Just Total focus
3.) Wealth, psychoses, male employees, blue collar, white collar, wealth, gender stereotypes,
male role, socioeconomics, masculinity
4.) Kent starks database
5.) No I feel fine. Nothing particular, I just have work to do. Which that was the last of it so I
guess I feel good.
Participant 2
Final Journal
A) Yea, when I finally did understand the assignment due to receiving the six papers we had
to fill out, then I understood that this assignment wasn’t going to be too much to handle.
B) Same as I knew before, because I had to do a research paper my senior year in high
school.
C) No

186
D) Hopefully a B, because I honestly don’t know how much of an effort I’ll put towards this
paper.
E) Nothing

Participant 6
For each journal entry, I would like you to please answer the following questions:
1) Where are you? (e.g. at home, in the Stark library, etc.) Home
2) What is happening around you? (e.g. Is it noisy or quiet, are you doing multiple things at the
same time or just looking for information for the essay, are there other things competing for your
attention, such as friends or family members, etc.?) Is there anything else going on while you’re
searching for information for your essay? (e.g. a sudden interruption, have to go to class, pressed
for time, at work, etc.) In my dining room silently with no distractions.
3) What keywords are you using to look for information for your essay? Has this changed from
the keywords you used in class? If so, why did you change keywords? Teen Pregnancy, Teens,
Media. the same terms I used in school
4) What resource or resources are you using to look for information for your essay? Kentlink.
(Google, Google Scholar, an academic research database, in a journal or a book, etc.) ?
Has this changed from the resource or resources you used in class? If so, why did you change
resource/s? I tried logging into kentlink and it will not let me at home.
5) How do you feel while you’re looking for information for your essay? (e.g. confident,
anxious, nervous, disappointed, stressed, etc.?) Stressed since it will only work at school giving
me little time to do it as a full time student working part time, I cannot be at school that long
when I have prior engagements.
6) Or, is there anything else you would like to add about this particular information search time?
Just that it is hard to have to research but not be able to get it on my computer at home.

187
Appendix F: Epoché
Epoché (transcribed notes on thoughts/musings prior to the beginning of the study)
RESEARCHER THOUGHTS/NOTED BIASES PRIOR TO ENTERING FIELD


Students who test into remedial classes experience more anxiety than their peers
(academic, information, otherwise). OBSERVED PERSONALLY, ALSO SEEN IN
RESEARCH.



Students may overestimate their abilities in information-seeking, based on previous
‘successes’ with poor information-seeking strategies, and therefore feel no need to seek
assistance to correct these strategies, not recognizing their inabilities or lack of academic
skills (Gross & Latham, Competency Theory, etc.).
o Could be true – I have often observed this during my own instruction with
students, and have seen how some students prefer to Google things rather than
look at databases for information, even immediately following instruction … but
do students really believe they ‘know what they’re doing?’ I’m not sure …



Students also can’t assess the ‘information competency’ of others, due to their inability to
recognize their own lack of ability when it comes to information-seeking.
o This bears out often in group discussions, as I have observed … but what of group
discussions conducted by instructors and facilitated by librarians? I’ve noticed
marginal differences in the way these turn out – however, I’ve often seen how
students rely on the advice of their classmates … even when that advice leads
them down the wrong path. What gives with that, anyway?



Students in this course have additional concerns that may not necessarily be shared by
college-ready undergraduate students (previous education experiences, financial
concerns, anxiety levels, worrying about their performance in this class and what it may
mean for future college classes, etc.).
o In prior experience working with remedial students, some of them shared with me
things that they believed hampered their ability to succeed – things like transport
or lack thereof, young children (and oftentimes a single parent caring for the
young child/children with minimal support), work commitments and
workplaces/employers who don’t necessarily care about ‘school coming first’ and

188
students feel they must be at work or risk losing their jobs. I’ve also had a few of
these students tell me they feel ‘stupid’ and instructors from other remedial
classes have made them feel even more stupid … I wonder if this will bear out in
this study, too? NOT AN EASY THING FOR ANYONE TO ADMIT FEELING.


May have additional feelings related to testing into these courses that impact their
emotional state, or their willingness to be in the course at all. Some may have failed this
course before, and may be even MORE disgruntled about being in the course.



May not know where to go for assistance if needed, and may be reluctant to ask for help
at all. Whether it be of the instructor or of a friend … do they ask for help?



Possibly disgruntled, confused, angry, upset, or otherwise emotionally affected by being
placed into the course – could impact the effort they put toward the course itself. May
not be willing to expend any extra effort, energy on classwork/homework/tasks, etc.



May feel hopeless, helpless, etc.
o Not just in terms of completing the assignments, but in terms of their academic
progress overall. Noticed this many times, have heard this related by my remedial
instructor colleagues, too.



Information-seeking – assuming it will be shallow, may have learned ‘good’ strategies
but forgotten them or put them aside for quicker, less taxing searches that allow them to
satisfice in their information-seeking for academic assignments.
o Might be the case if there is a quick turnaround/deadline expected, too. Breland
and Breland – return to what we ‘know,’ despite training. BEARS OUT?



May resist being a part of this research? I will be sure to reiterate participation or not, my
study has zero impact on their performance or grades in the course.
o As Frank and I found when we tried to survey remedial undergrads in our study,
there may be a high unwillingness to participate (however, I’m hoping that
financial incentives provided may change this a bit).



GENERAL FEELINGS: Curiosity, but also nervous … what if students feel like my
presence is overwhelming? What if they resent my wanting to study what they do, think
that I’m being rude/insulting? How do I counter that? ALWAYS BE RESPECTFUL.



How I will handle student questions about AISP – “That’s a really great question. I want
to be sure you get the best assistance possible as it relates to what is expected of you, so if

189
you like I will pass along your message/question to the instructor, or else leave you to ask
the instructor yourself, if you prefer?”
o DON’T GET INVOLVED!!! Write it on my hand as a reminder if I have to –
THIS IS NOT MY CLASSROOM.


Manage my expectations – meaning, inspect ‘nothing,’ observe ‘everything’ – eyes wide
open … even with what I know, what is there that I don’t know? What am I seeing and
how am I seeing it differently? RESPECT MY ‘SEPARATE’ ROLE IN THE FIELD.



Manage instructor expectations (particularly because I know her) – not here to “help”
students, here to “see” their experience – describe their experience – document their
experience … continually refer student questions to her.



Overall – be compassionate, but not ‘research blind,’ respectful but aware, engaged but
not overwhelmed/immersed … OBSERVE/DOCUMENT EXPERIENCE AS IT IS
RELATED BY PARTICIPANTS. MY OBSERVATIONS ARE SECONDARY.

Appendix G: In-class observation and bracketing notes
College Writing I Stretch (Blundell) – Spring 2014
Date
3/7/2014

Bias/subjective notes
*Pre-course chatter: Students say they are
“low motivated” to be in class or complete
academic assignments for class because there
is no credit being offered for this course.

Observations
*Professor begins course by telling students this
course is a “clean slate” – can improve on their
performance from prior course (Intro. To College
Writing Stretch).

*General feeling from students is that they are
not motivated to be in the course, and that
they are frustrated and annoyed by the
assignments.

*Also explains that course will be more difficult than
first course. Must meet certain standards to excel,
and pass writing course and move onto College
Writing II.

*Some students indicated they did feel they
improved over time – were more attuned to
required elements, better able to read
critically, constructively.

*Advises students to reduce anxiety and work toward
succeeding in this course by getting ahead of the
assignments, preparing for the end of the class
NOW.

*Students said they found readings difficult
and boring, but professor joked with them and
explained how they can make it fruitful for
themselves.

* “Developing confident, strong, responsible college
writers” (professor to students).

*Professor has a very non-judgmental
approach to her students’ responses – they are
honest, but she reiterates why pre-planning is
best, and encourages them to move forward.
*Minimal responses from students to
questions asked of them, but professor
continues to ask questions and encourage
participation.
*Many students texted throughout class.

*Professor asks students about toughest part of
getting their practice writing points – students
respond “getting it done!”
*There is an in-class discussion about best practices
for engaging in academic reading – professor makes
distinction about how different people choose
different times to read effectively (e.g. morning,
evening etc.) based on their “ecology.”
*Professor gives students a revision of effective
reading strategies introduced in first course, engages
students in discussion of this topic.
*Professor reiterates that “being here” is one of the
most important aspects of the class, and encourages
students to use the Writing Center.
*Prof. introduces first writing assignment for the
course (non-info-seeking required). Drills right
down to the way the assignment should be formatted
in Word.
*Gives students freedom to explore why things are
the way they are in assignments.
*Goes over basic grammar and punctuation rules.*

191
4/7/2014

*Students turned in their Essay 2 assignment
today, and were workshopping what they had
done previously to better develop their
understanding of writing mechanics. Some
seem confused, and many do not have their
previous assignments with them to evaluate
during class time.
*Prof. talks about periodicals, but doesn’t
necessarily explain definition clearly –
includes newspapers and magazines within
her definition of ‘periodicals,’ which are not
traditionally considered periodicals – appears
to confuse some students even more.
*During discussion on academic journals,
students appear somewhat confused by this
notion, and also somewhat nervous when told
the reading/comprehension level for articles is
higher. One or two students indicate they
have used academic journals before, and
explained the challenges they had with the
articles.
2nd half of class in lab
*Most students seem distracted and to not be
paying attention to what Prof. is explaining
about hand-on assignments.
*Only a few students participate in discussion
during this period.
*During lab time, a student (study participant
AC) asks if you can use cited sources from an
article to do further research – in my opinion,
this reflects higher level thing that some who
work with remedial students doubt they have!
Also consults thesaurus for synonyms without
being prompted – further evidence?
Additional lab observations:
*Study participant TH appears to be quite
self-sufficient in developing a search strategy,
and uses resources independently.
*Other students need a lot more assistance and
instruction from prof. (including study
participants RH, JJ, and AK) as they work.

*Prof. asks class if they have used resources for
papers before, and if so, what kinds of sources they
have used. Students indicated they have used – peer
response journals, books, interviews, websites, and
videos in the past as sources.
*Prof. asks if students have used a magazine or a
newspaper before – explains that they will use them
for this assignment.
*Prof. asks if students have heard of an academic
journal, and explains to students what these are.
Explains they typically are published quarterly or
annually, and explains that difference between
magazines and newspapers (which she refers to as
general readership periodicals) and academic
journals are the type of content published within.
*Prof. explains that the hallmark of magazines and
newspapers are about content (length of pieces,
inclusion of ads, reading/comprehension level of
pieces), the inclusion of images (typically lots of
images) and how often they are produces. Also,
explains that journalists write magazine and
newspaper content, editors review them, and media
companies publish the content.
*Prof. then moves to explaining difference between
magazines/newspapers and academic journals.
Explains that AJ content is produced by experts in
the field (e.g. doctors write for medical journals, etc.)
– content produced by scholarly experts in the field,
have advanced degrees, and articles are published by
academic or professional journals within or respected
by “the academy.” Also explains peer review and
the point of this step in the academic journal
publishing process. Explains that specialized
language is used in articles, that they are longer, the
content is more complex and that the comprehension
level requires is more challenging than that required
of magazines and newspapers.
*Prof. moves on to a discussion of keywords and the
role they play in conducting a search for information,
particularly when looking for information in
academic journals.
*Explains that synonyms and combining keywords
can help make search results more relevant, and
limits information retrieved to a manageable amount.
*Prof. asks students to find keywords from a
previous essay, and tells them they will then go and

192
do a hands-on assignment using keywords in the
computer lab. Encourages them to look at their
thesis statements from previous essays, and pull out
keywords from themes expressed in statements.
2nd half of class in lab
*Prof. directs them to the regional campus library
homepage, and into the “Finding articles” page.
*Starts talking about resources they can use, shows
them the resources that won’t be appropriate, and
encourages students to participate in discussion on
why they aren’t appropriate.
*Prof explains how shuffling keywords as you
establish which ones work and which ones don’t will
help return better search results, and will minimize
the number of returned results.
(Study participant TH): When asked about her
process, she explained she was looking for
information related to her previous essay, and that
she was using the keywords ‘favoritism, athletes,
privileged’ to find information on these themes
(taken from her thesis statement). As she goes
through the returned results, she clicks on suggested
keywords within results, and does surface-level
analysis of returned results.
(Study participant AC): While searching, accesses
the thesaurus tool through Google to find synonyms
for her search terms/keywords without being
prompted.
(Study participant JJ): Uses the references at the end
of an article he has found to look for other resources
to use. Uses keywords ‘high school, athletes,
popularity.’
(Study participant RH): Explains he is working
through his citations to see if any of them will be
relevant as he searches for more information.
(Study participant SL): Spends a great deal of time
reading through abstracts of returned results to assess
their usefulness, she explains.
*Prof. walks all students through the process of
saving retrieved searches and relevant articles for
later use.

193
4/9/2014

*Study participant TH tells prof. she has
ordered an article from ILL for use later
(without being prompted) – further evidence
of higher order info-seeking skills?
*Study participant RH indicates he found
three sources of information during his search
… but no sources appeared to have been
found during lab time?
*Students mention during class that prof.
doesn’t respond to emails – and that this
makes them feel unsupported in the class.
2nd half of class in lab
*Study participants SL and AK are having a
discussion about how ‘advanced’ HS students
were treated better than they were during their
time in HS, and both had personal experiences
of this to share. They said because of this,
they don’t necessarily consider themselves
“smart.”
*Students as a whole seem very distracted
during lab time.
*Most students are looking at the information
they have returned, and trying to figure out
what they are supposed to do with it.
Scholarly resources and their use are not
necessarily explained again, and it appears
that they need to be.
*During discussion of ILIAD use, Prof.
doesn’t seem to know as much about the
system as she thinks she does … sometimes
makes process more complicated for students
than it needs to be, and it appears to frustrate
students a lot.

*Class discussion starts by talking about what was
learned during lab searches for information during
the previous class.
*Also a discussion on why searches may have failed.
Students answer with the following:
*Keywords – usage returned too many results for
information, need to refine them as they go along.
*Prof. has brief discussion on LofC subject
headings, and what they are/how they work.
Indicates they can also be used as keywords in
searches for information and will help them narrow
the retrieved results.
*Brief discussion of how Interlibrary Loan works
(prompted by TH’s explanation of ordering an article
through ILL), and how saving a citation beforehand
can help references later (esp. when putting them
into Word).
*Many in the class explain they are now waiting for
ILL materials they have ordered.
*Study participant AC is asked to come up and pull
up her library account so prof. can show students
how to order an ILL material through OhioLINK and
ILIAD.
*Prof. points out three elements in ILIAD system –
outstanding requests, electronically received articles,
and cancelled requests. AC wasn’t able to find the
article she ordered so prof. indicates they will search
for it again during lab time in the second half of
class.
*Prof. is walking them through looking for
articles/scholarly resources for previously written
essays before working on searches for Essay 3.
2nd half of class in lab

*Individual work in lab appears to be
challenging for most students, and they are
easily distracted from the task at hand.
However, study participant JJ is working on
his assignment by himself, and he appears to
be trying to focus on his task despite
distraction from other classmates.

*Discussing keywords that would return better
results for searches.

*Both AC and TH have been pretty selfsufficient thus far, pick up the skills needed to
complete the lab assignment quickly, and are

*Study participant AC working on finding
information and learning how to save information
(such as an abstract) into Word. Uses keywords
‘advertisement and income,’ and ‘discretionary

*Students return a number of results, study
participant AK especially seems to assess
“usefulness” of articles by looking article titles.

194
content to keep working on them without
prof.’s help.

income.’ Prof. walks her through the ILIAD process
as she searches.

*However, JJ, AK, SL, and RH appear to be
having a lot more trouble with the task than
their peers, especially when revising keywords
used.

*Study participant JJ is reading through an article he
has retrieved, and looking at its citation.

*Lose two study participants who had
previously signed up – they have not been in
class for almost two weeks – brings total
participants down to six.

4/14/2014

*Prof. sometimes refers to multiple
information sources as ‘databases,’ which is
not correct – could confuse students more.
*Frequent absences and tardiness within the
class make instruction and continual building
of information literacy skills problematic for
students – often forget what they have learned
between their last attendance and now.
*Made the choice NOT to observe student
searching in the lab today – they appeared too
anxious in my presence, and I didn’t want to
stop them from doing their work – perhaps
this is because instead of the “closed” lab
environment in which they had worked
before, they were redirected to the open
student lab, where others were watching them
as well.

4/18/2014

*Once again, tardiness and attendance is a
major issue in this class – definitely affects
participation, particularly during the first
portion of class.
*Only three study participants were in class
today.
*During writing workshop portion of this
class, students appear to be getting frustrated
and the sense of resistance they feel to doing
assignments such as this one is becoming
palpable. Prof. also appears to be frustrated,
her tone is getting terse. Prof. then moves
class from a group discussion to one-on-one
work and assistance from her – is this a walk
to calm these frustrations? This tactic does
seem to lessen student anxiety a great deal.

*Prof. is working with RH on finding information –
explaining what information returned means (such
as, what a book review is, how to find an abstract,
etc.) – Prof. explains that RH is learning how to find
sources, so he can carry that knowledge forward
through his studies.

*Prof. starts class by reiterating difference between
database you search to find information, and the
resource in which the source exists (e.g. may be
linked to source through Academic Search Complete,
but the source itself is in the Journal of Applied
Engineering ...).
*Prof asks class to discuss the resources they have
found at this point – TH has found four of the six
required resources, both RH and JJ indicate they are
“halfway done.”

*Class begins – Prof. asks students to pull out their
former essay drafts and underline “icky sentences” –
ones that she says make them feel ‘uncomfortable’
for some reason. Has them underline these sentences
in their drafts.
*Prof. then has each student pick a sentence they had
chosen and write it on the board in the front of the
class. Workshops each sentence with all students to
emphasize rules of grammar and punctuation (e.g.
subject/verb agreement, 1st vs. 3rd person, indefinite
agreement, expanding vocabulary and learning
different words).
*Prof. explains that writing is all part of the
academic research paper process. (Mentions to
students that she knows they hate these assignments
the most, but that they are the most important if they
are to improve.)

195
*Throughout class, students appear to be
anxious and frustrated – not sure if it is
because of the assignment itself, or because of
their feelings about the course in general.
4/21/2014

*When final essay assignment is introduced,
AK and RH express vocally how unimpressed
they are with the final assignment.
*AC and SL missing today – frequently
absent.
*Only TH is in class regularly.

*Prof. explains that the final essay for the course will
be a revision of one of their three in-class essays
completed in the previous course. She explains that
for the next class period, students must bring in a
descriptive, typed and double-spaced brief,
explaining which they think they are going to revise
and why, and explains they must give specific
examples in regard to why this was the essay chosen,
and their plan for revision, i.e. what the student will
do to make the selected essay better in the final draft.
*Prof. explains that during lab sessions and out of
class, they were asked to find at least two scholarly
resources for each of their previous three essays.
Explains that they will now incorporate those sources
into their essays.

4/23/2014

*Out of the seven students who attended the
class today, only two had completed the
assignment they were to submit today
(explanation of essay revision).
*When asked what abstract means, students
seem reluctant to answer.
*Although RH tends to be in class fairly
regularly, he is often quite late.
*Consistently throughout course – despite
complicated nature of the information
sometimes explained by the prof., very few
students take notes – of study participants,
only TH and JJ appear to take notes, ever.

*Today’s class focused on more in-depth scholarly
information-seeking, and learning how to use library
resources.
*Prof. pulls up a scholarly resource, shows students
the detail of it, reads the abstract and explains to
students how the abstract can explain the detail of an
article, and then pulls up the article itself.
*Explains that students will need to submit six
articles (two for each of their three previous essays)
to get the full points for their ‘scholarly resource’
assignment in the course. For the essay they choose
to revise for Essay 3, they must submit two scholarly
articles they found with their revision.
*Prof. continues to explain the elements of a
scholarly article, including what separates a scholarly
article from a popular press article (e.g. newspaper
article). Explains to students that ideas from article
must be cited in their essays with a parenthetical
citation, and also, that students can quote appropriate
phrases from articles, which must be cited in their
essays.

4/29/2014

*Students in general seem far behind on all
assignments, with the exception of TH.

*Prof. begins class by talking about how to
incorporate scholarly articles into an essay.

*During the break, JJ made the following
comment: “I spoke to someone in the College
Writing I class and they don’t have to do any
of this – and their final exam is a paper.”
Possibly indicates that students don’t
necessarily understand WHY they are in this

*Also discusses how to cite sources using a style
(such as MLA) for their essays.
*Brief discussion with class on what plagiarism
means, and refers students to specific page in the
MLA handbook for a further definition. Prof.

196
course … which is problematic, and could
explain why so many of them seem frustrated
and low motivated (evident through their inclass behaviors such as talking and texting),
their constant distraction from tasks at hand,
etc.

explains that students can use someone else’s ideas
in three ways: Direct quotation, paraphrasing, or
summary (typically a larger piece, or of a whole
article).
*Prof. encourages discussion from students
regarding the nature of paraphrasing, and its role in
the scholarly citation/writing process.
*Prof. indicates that students should go back through
their scholarly articles and find quotes within sources
that support the points they make in their essays.
*Prof. indicates that the place quotes/paraphrases are
included in an essay is where they supports the
points you are attempting to make.
*Prof. ends the lesson by explaining how scholarly
resources are included in a “Works Cited” page at
the essay’s conclusion. Explains that this final page
is part of the scholarly documentation process. Also
explains the difference between a print source, and
an electronic source.

END OF IN-CLASS OBSERVATION

197
Appendix H: Phenomenological reduction process (conducted during data analysis)
Before beginning/creating info profiles:


SO FRUSTRATED – Not just me, students too … so many things going on in the class
… how does anyone get through all of it? NO WONDER remedial students feel like
these classes are a waste of time!



Separate observation notes from interview notes – BE CLEAR ON WHICH IS WHICH



Try and include as many ‘verbatim’ quotes as possible throughout analysis – will be
useful for both the thematic cluster/emergent theme portion of analysis, and when
creating exhaustive description of experience to accompany model.



ONLY TWO OF SIX GAVE OOC/AISP JOURNALS (aargh) – be sure to include these
journal entries in analysis, but note that this is the case (only 1/3 of study participated).



Be clear, concise, go back to notes if necessary – don’t forget the inclusion of peer
debriefing in significant statement and final thematic map stages of analysis!

Random thoughts/biases/acknowledgments which occurred during analysis process


CANNOT IMAGINE how students face challenges … and still handle moniker of
‘remedial’ – clear that it bothers them … should the concept be
separated/amended/changed? Self-guided educational autonomy?



Two of six participants indicated they are ‘very confident’ in their AISP abilities/skills …
(competency theory a la Gross?) – seeing them in class, they appeared to be comfortable
with basic information-seeking within Google … but beyond that (within databases
specifically) they seemed to flounder – mismatch? BE SURE TO KEEP THIS FEELING
TO MYSELF … but pay attention to their descriptions vs. final assignment performance
upon further review.



In re-reading the information profiles, it seems that instructor assistance was viewed as
both a help and a hindrance – sometimes by the same student. Specifics revealed as to
why this is the case? YES.
o Future study should include a breakdown of instructional methods …
inappropriate for the goals of this study (RE: focus on participant experience

198
ONLY, per descriptive phenomenological requirements), but may be worth
investigating from a case study or educational ethnography angle?


Anxiety abounds from numerous sources – including competing concerns in other
courses … fair to ask students to perform remedial work (and consequently the many
building remedial assignments) while enrolled in traditional college classes? Does this
set students up for unrealistic workload expectations (pro/con?)?



More longitudinal study is needed in this domain – how did students get here? What do
they believe led them here? FUTURE INTERPRETIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL
ANALYSIS STUDY IDEA: What does it mean to you to be considered a ‘remedial’
student? How do you relate to your ‘remedial’ peers? ‘Non’ remedial peers?



Emotions of AISP affected by a number of factors – performance in previous class (if this
is their second go-around), instructor’s teaching style, believing they know what they’re
doing in the AISP but despite not returning relevant results … not changing that opinion?
HOW DO WE (LIS instructors) COUNTER THIS?



Time – competing courses – difficulties understanding instructional style – ‘challenging’
assignment elements (grammar exercises, etc.) … all seem to play a role in overall
approach to AISP – synonymous with Williamson (2005) and concept of ecological
factors related to information behavior?



Although probed within many of the interviews, responses not very clear/question skirted
regarding how students feel performance in this course is different from previous course
(if they had taken the course before), and whether or not they’ll be successful.



Some claims that particular instruction needed to finish AISP was not taught/received –
nearly all of these things were addressed (I was there!) … high absence rate
DEFINITELY affected understanding of some in terms of conducting AISP.



Lab time problematic for some – would this be different if it were structured? Guided?

After reviewing participants’ final research assignments:
Some ‘got’ it in theory, but didn’t fulfill all requirements (failure to conform to MLA citation
style, didn’t include work from information within text, etc.) – others … no evidence at all of
research having an impact on revised final assignment. Sigh. How is this fixed?!?

instructor if she found a good source, could she consult the sources cited by the article's author for more
information.
Participant said her experience in the class overall has been enlightening: "I literally felt like a Christian who just
left church," she said, discussing how she feels after attending each of the classes for this course.
Participant explained that she had done "a legitimate research paper project" before, but that "the paper was for
research" purposes only.
When asked about her experience with the assignment for the [study] course, participant said "I feel like this
project is much less challenging" than the previous research project she had done in high school.
In discussing performing scholarly research for the class assignment, participant stated she was "having a hard
time finding scholarly resources for revision" and overall felt like she was finding very little relevant information
for her topic.
Participant said "I had an easier time finding resources" for the previous essays as a part of the assigned
preparation exercise for the final assignment (i.e. lab time given to students to search for scholarly resources with
instructor assistance).
Describing her search process for scholarly resources, participant said she searched different keywords, and tried
different databases for information with the same keywords.
Participant said she was "barely giving up any time or effort for this essay," stating that she believed what she
found during lab time was sufficient.
"I did my entire revision in one day."
In terms of the time the final assignment for the course was introduced, participant said "I feel that introducing
the essay two weeks before [the end of the course] was a bit off, but when [the instructor] explained why, it made
sense."
Participant said of the class in general that she feels it is "invigorating, enlightening."
When describing her emotions when looking for scholarly research for the final assignment, participant stated
"I'm in the zone and I'm working on it."
Background context: "I felt there was something different about me from everybody else."
Participant said she is able to easily approach people, and thinks this makes her different from her peers.
"I'm a learner - I love learning … and psychology is the biggest mystery of my life and I can't wait to learn about
it."

FINAL ASSIGNMENT] - HOPEFULLY A B, BECAUSE I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF AN
EFFORT I'LL PUT TOWARDS THIS PAPER.
FINAL PAPER COMMENT: NO EVIDENCE OF THE USE OF SCHOLARLY SOURCES IN THE FINAL
PAPER (NO IN-TEXT QUOTES OR CITATIONS, NO WORKS CITED PAGE AT THE END OF THE
PAPER).
Uses 'lab time' to search for scholarly information, based on instruction.
Participant indicated that although this is his second semester in college; it is the first semester he has taken
English requirements. He has taken both of the English stretch courses this semester.
Participant stated in high school, he "wasn't really motivated to do a lot of work, but when I got here [to
MidState] … I had to [because college] was a little more challenging," whereas he felt his high school experience
had not been as challenging, and the workload he had previously experienced in high school was great increased
when he came to college.
In terms of how he deals with the workload increase, participant said "my time management skills had to be
improved a lot - I just wasn't used to all the workload."
Participant said he struggled at first with the workload transition, but "I've done a lot better in my [2nd]
semester."
Speaking about English, participant said "I always thought it was one of my stronger suits," but feels this class in
particular has prepared him for further college work.
Participant feels the course instructor was "very demanding - I liked it - and I respected that [the work] was more
demanding."
Participant said his high school classes were less demanding, and that the homework given was minimal
compared to that of his workload at college.
Participant said that he believes the course has better equipped him for future study: "I feel like it's challenged me
a lot more … I feel like I'm ready for any other class."
Participant said he had not done any scholarly research in high school, but that he had done some kind of research
in elementary school, involving scholarly resources.
"I don't understand how to cite things - I was just winging it."
Participant indicated he appreciated the instruction in the class regarding scholarly research, particularly in
learning how to use research databases.
Participant stated he read his first essay from the last part of the first English stretch course (part I of the 2-part
stretch series) and in comparing it to the revised version [completed in this class], he felt he had definitely gained
a lot between the two essays.
In terms of assistance, participant stated he had asked his mother to review his essay (which he says he asks her
to assist him with regularly) and said "my mom felt I'd improved a lot … I was unsure [before this assignment]
how to do [research and citations] correctly."
Participant explained he asked his mother for help because she has a master's degree, and is a writing coach and
instructor at the main campus of MidState University.

After submitting the paper for the course, participant said of scholarly research "it's a longer process," and "I'm
not comfortable with it right now and I'm sure I have more to learn about it," which he believes will happen in
future classes.
When doing research for his assignment, participant said he used the keywords "American family" and "normal,"
and found a lot of information about higher income families vs. lower income families.
Of the information he found after his research, participant said he felt that some of the information made out that
'normal' had to do with money, to which he responded "That thing about unity, it's not about money."
When asked why he chose the keywords he used to search for information, participant said that he was unsure he
would find the information he was looking for under TV. Specifically, he wasn't sure he would find anything
about the Sopranos and his topic (the 'normal' American family and traditional family values), and "didn't want to
veer off topic" by including too many keywords in his search.
In terms of asking for assistance with the assignment, participant said that other than meeting with the course
instructor, he also turned to his mother: "She helped me revise."
In terms of who he might consult for assistance with future research projects, participant said "Maybe the
library?" indicated that he thought there must be people over there who know about database searches.
Participant indicated he is generally motivated to do well in his college classes.
Participant explained although he was not particularly motivated to do an in-depth job with the research
assignment for this course; he hopes to improve and learn more about performing scholarly research in the future.
"I really do care about doing well"
Participant explained he was not particularly focused on the essay itself for this course, citing competing
concerns in other courses as one reason for not focusing on the essay.
"I'm not a big fan of citations," and said the in-class instruction regarding citations was quite challenging to
comprehend.
Felt that students in the course were given a lot of information to consume in the abstract, and explained that he
doesn't necessarily learn well this way.
Participant said he learns best in a workshop-style environment, and felt that the day they were given instruction
on citations with examples would have been better spent composing citations and learning more about research in
the lab environment: "I'm better doing hands-on work, with experience," and said the time they spent in the lab
doing just that was very helpful to him.
Participant said he feels the class as a whole has made him more capable of handling the next academic phase.
FINAL PAPER COMMENT: INCLUDES A 'WORKS CITED' PAGE WITH REFERENCES/SCHOLARLY
RESOURCES (SOME OF THEM), BUT DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY IN-TEXT COMMENTS, CITATIONS,
OR INDICATIONS THAT THESE SOURCES INFORMED HIS COMPLETION OF THE ASSIGNMENT.
Has stated he has problems with assignments during class discussions.
Does use 'lab time' to do research, but often finds himself distracted.
Stated this is the second time he has taken this course, and hopes to pass this one (as he failed the previous course
by only a few points).
Participant stated he had originally planned to go straight to the main campus of MidState, but then he received a
letter saying he should come to MidState's regional campus first to improve his grades.

Participant stated that he "had to take this class again," as he had failed the course previously.
Of this class, participant said that they cover "a lot of the same stuff but [the instructor] teaches class in a very
different way," further explaining that he found it hard to adjust to the instructor's teaching style.
Of the class, participant said "some stuff is confusing," especially "talking about grammar and punctuation rules
… I had to comprehend and understand what she meant."
For the final assignment, participant stated he was thinking of revising either his Hidden Curriculum essay or his
Cultural Artifact essay because he had challenges finding information for his Ad Analysis essay. Particularly, he
said he felt the resources he found for the AA essay were "too old," and explained he had a lot of difficulty
finding resources in the databases suggested in class.
Participant explained he finds the class research assignment to be very challenging, but that the most challenging
assignment of the course for him had been the first essay submitted for the course: "It might have been my worst
essay."
In comparison, although participant said he had challenges finding resources in general, he "[doesn't] think the
final essay will be as difficult," but that in terms of the essay he has selected for revision, that "it could backfire."
Participant said he is very concerned about the final essay, especially failing the essay, because it would mean he
will fail the course again.
Participant indicated that for the final assignment in the previous course he had visited the Writing Center for
assistance, but that "it was a big failure - I don't know if I would go back to them again."
When asked about his experience with the WC, participant said he felt the WC made his work more challenging,
because he felt the staff didn't pay attention to the guidelines for the paper he shared, and that "they gave wrong
advice."
When the participant shared his experience with the previous instructor, the instructor informed the students that
the WC had indeed gotten the guidelines wrong, and that they didn't have to return for assistance.
When discussing his final essay, participant said he had found resources for his revision, but that he "doesn't
remember what they are, really."
When asked more about his selection for revision, participant said "If I use [CA for the third essay], I feel I could
get a good grade but it's a toss up."
In terms of his final paper, participant explained that what may trip him up academically would be "not hitting
the points [the instructor] wants me to hit.
When asked if he had consulted another resource for his final essay, participant said he had asked the instructor,
but "Asking for teachers' help can confuse you more at times - make you feel more lost." Additionally, participant
said "the way [the instructor] explains it (i.e. the parameters of the assignment), it's more confusing."
When prompted to discuss his emotions related to asking for assistance from the instructor, particularly assistance
to complete the final assignment, participant said "It's completely frustrating. You think you're going to get the
help you need and then you ask for help and it's completely confusing."
However, participant stated that after repeated visits for assistance to the instructor for the final essay asking for
further explanation of the assignment's requirements, that he did find it "a little bit more easily understanding [the instructor] broke it down a lot more.
In terms of his experience in the class and whether he found it helpful overall, participant said "A little bit, yes as a whole, it was helpful - but the [grammar/punctuation rules] messed everyone up."

After the class, participant said he now finds scholarly research "a little bit easier," and that "I think I have
somewhat of an upper hand" if he has to perform scholarly research in the future.
However, in returning conversation to his search for information for the AA essay, participant said "the only
thing that kind of concerns me is [the inability to find resources] for the Ad Analysis essay."
Participant said he was frustrated with the process as a whole, because "I had to find keywords to plug in, but
nothing came up. It was almost like a dead end."
Participant explained that as they were primed for the final assignment by being instructed to find scholarly
resources for all their previous essays, that it was a frustrating process for a number of reasons especially when
the instructor was assisting them.
"Even when she tries to help us, and we still don't find things, I feel like it will count against us," because he said
there is no partial credit for attempting scholarly research - students either find resources or they don't.
In talking more about his feelings about scholarly research and its relationship to the final assignment, participant
said "Time isn't exactly on our side," and that the felt like they had to learn "a lot of stuff in a short amount of
time."
In going through these classes, and learning the facets required for further academic study, including learning
how to do scholarly research, participant said "Every time we do it [i.e. learn more about academic requirements
for future study], and try to turn ... I feel like a tire stuck in the mud - I'm trying and trying and not getting
anywhere."
"Redoing things doesn't help."

As the deadline approached, participant said he feels like "time is working against us now."

Overall, participant said he has found the experience of learning how to do scholarly research frustrating, even
more so in this second class, because of learning to adjust to a new teaching style, as well as expanding on the
necessary tools required for further academic study.

Often gets frustrated during class, and doesn't often participate in discussions.

Does not typically take notes or otherwise engage with material. Sometimes seems flustered when asked to submit
assignments that are due.
Of the class itself, participant stated "it's pretty simple, some stuff" but also said that "it's hard to tell when things
are due - it would be helpful if due dates were on the syllabus."

Participant said she finds it hard to keep up with required turn-in dates because of the lack of information on the
syllabus.
Participant said she would prefer if they were "focusing on one kind of teaching - not focusing on a bunch of
different ways."
"I like [the instructor] as a teacher, but not the class - it's not really my cup of tea."
Of the research assignment for the class, participant said "it's really confusing," referring back to the teaching
style of the course instructor and the lack of due dates for different assignments due in the course that makes
focusing on one thing difficult for her.
"There are a whole bunch of different parts that are due and you don't know when they're due."
"I have competing assignments as well" and explains further that requirements for the course are not explained
very well on the syllabus.
Participant couldn't indicate whether she had done this kind of research in the past or not, but said she did feel
like it was more challenging because of so many other assignments due around the same time in the class.
Participant said she chose to revise her CA essay for the final assignment, however, she found the scholarly
research portion of the final assignment challenging for a number of reasons. Although participant indicated the
concept of research was "not that hard," she felt the instructor "could make it easier and clearer what she wants."
Specifically talking about the lab time students were given to conduct scholarly research, participant said "[the
instructor] just throws us in the computer lab and I don't know what we're supposed to do."
"If she set dates everything would be easier - if she set dates, we could focus on one thing at a time."
When asked why she chose to revise her CA essay for the final assignment, participant answered "because I feel
like that was the easiest essay for me to do," and further indicated she felt it would therefore be the easiest essay
for her to revise.
In terms of performing research to meet the requirements of the final assignment, participant said "finding
information was easy".
She explained further she found her information mostly online, "I Googled it," but that she also went through a
few of the databases suggested in class.
Participant indicated she used "American norms of gymnastics" and "stereotypes" as her information search
keywords, because she felt that those keywords would give her the most useful information.
During class lab time, participant said the instructor "suggested keywords, but didn't explain why," so she chose
to continue on with her own keywords instead of using those suggested by the instructor.
When asked if she had approached anyone for assistance with the final assignment and/or performing scholarly
research, participant said she has gone to her mother for help because "she's getting her master's, and she can help
with my works cited."
Participant said she often felt "confused" and "stupid" during the class, particularly because of how the instructor
explains things to the class.
Of the instructor's explanations: "Like when she explained the works cited - she made it harder than it actually
was, which makes it more confusing."
Participant said during information-seeking, particularly for the final assignment, that she is "pretty confident"
and said she found it easy to find information for the final assignment.

Participant said it would have been harder to find information for one of the other essays, because she believed
they were harder topics.
"There was a lot of stuff [found when she conducted scholarly research for the other class essays] that didn't
apply to my essay topics."
FINAL PAPER COMMENT: PARTICIPANT INCLUDED A QUOTE IN THE TEXT OF THE PAPER, BUT
WITH NO AUTHOR/CITATION INFORMATION WHATSOEVER (IDENTIFIED AS A QUOTE ONLY BY
HER USE OF QUOTATION MARKS). ALSO, ALTHOUGH A REFERENCE OF SOME KIND IS

assignment "helped me better understand it," particularly "having it relate to my essays."
When asked about her experience conducting scholarly research, participant said "this is really hard," further
explaining how difficult it was for her to find information on some of her topics.
Participant said the course instructor helped her with developing search strategies, in referring her to specific
databases, and showing her how to reference different keywords.
Participant said the course instructor was "able to answer my questions and break it down," especially when she
had questions about what an academic journal is, and as she learned more about abstracts and keywords.
When asked about her opinion on the purpose of scholarly research, particularly for the class assignment,
participant said the articles she found were "more in detail," and they were "backed by facts rather than
opinions."
Participant said she believes scholarly research "usually comes out of colleges I guess you could say."
Participant explained that the instructor for this class is the only professor she talks to in general.
Participant said she has used the Writing Center in the past.

In response to questions about her experience during the library session, participant said "I'm sure there was
[more/useful information] but not that I remember - he [the librarian who conducted the session] definitely talked
more than he should have."
Participant said she felt far too much information was presented during the library session for students to
remember in the long term.
Participant explained she felt the scholarly research assignment "helped me better understand what to do in the
future."
Participant said she was unsure where she could go for help with future assignments, saying "Maybe the
professor, or the Writing Center? I'm sure those people could help me."
When asked to explain her feelings toward the scholarly research assignment in the class, participant said that
when it was first introduced in class, "it was kind of overwhelming because there were so many things to learn,"
and that they had to "find all the keywords."
Participant said when the assignment was introduced in class, "there was no computer in front of us as [the course
instructor] explained all the information - we had to remember what all the information was, and that's why I
wrote it down."
After doing hands-on exercises conducting scholarly research during lab time, participant said "I feel less
overwhelmed now about research," but indicated she will probably feel overwhelmed again when the students are
given more information about the final essay requirement for the class.
Of scholarly research in general, participant said "It's a lot of information and you don't always know what to do
with this."
Of the final assignment itself, participant said "this is not a pointless assignment - I think it will be helpful down
the road."
Participant said for future experiences, "we won't have to teach ourself [sic]."

FINAL PAPER COMMENT: INCLUDES A CITATION WITHIN
TEXT [ALTHOUGH NOT IN MLA FORMAT, AS WAS REQUIRED],
BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE A WORKS CITED PAGE AT THE END
OF THE ESSAY.
Frequently uses 'lab time' to do scholarly research for her essays, and
seems interested in the process as a whole.
She consults resources that may assist her in her search (such as an
online thesaurus) without prompts from the instructor, and asks questions
about citing sources. E.g. During a class discussion on research, she
asked the instructor if she found a good source, could she consult the
sources cited by the article's author for more information.
Participant said her experience in the class overall has been enlightening:
"I literally felt like a Christian who just left church," she said, discussing
how she feels after attending each of the classes for this course.
Participant explained that she had done "a legitimate research paper
project" before, but that "the paper was for research" purposes only.
When asked about her experience with the assignment for the [study]
course, participant said "I feel like this project is much less challenging"
than the previous research project she had done in high school.
In discussing performing scholarly research for the class assignment,
participant stated she was "having a hard time finding scholarly
resources for revision" and overall felt like she was finding very little
relevant information for her topic.
Participant said "I had an easier time finding resources" for the previous
essays as a part of the assigned preparation exercise for the final
assignment (i.e. lab time given to students to search for scholarly
resources with instructor assistance).
Describing her search process for scholarly resources, participant said
she searched different keywords, and tried different databases for
information with the same keywords.
Participant said she was "barely giving up any time or effort for this
essay," stating that she believed what she found during lab time was
sufficient.
"I did my entire revision in one day."
In terms of the time the final assignment for the course was introduced,
participant said "I feel that introducing the essay two weeks before [the
end of the course] was a bit off, but when [the instructor] explained why,
it made sense."

Participant's self-reported level of confidence with the strength of
AISP skills does not match the level of academic work completed for
the assignment.
Participant takes advantage of in-class opportunities to conduct AISP
with instructor assistance, and is interested in AISP process.
Participant is actively involved in AISP process during class
discussions, and has good instincts about IL skills.
Participant is enlightened by her overall experience in the course,
equates attendance to a feeling of spiritual fulfillment.
Participant has prior AISP experience, but not with using the
information retrieved to formulate a practical research paper.
Participant believes class research assignment to be less challenging
than the research assignment she completed previously.
Participant said she was having difficulty finding relevant scholarly
resources for her selected revision assignment after conducting her
AISP.
Participant had a less difficult time finding scholarly resources for
previous essays during AISP 'practice.'
Participant's AISP included searching using a variety of keywords
and keyword combinations in different scholarly databases.
Participant has not expended a lot of effort outside of class on her
AISP.
Participant was able to complete her entire revision in one day.
Participant believed at first that the introduction of the research
assignment two weeks before the class' end was out of line with the
way the rest of the course had been conducted, but understood the
rationale for doing so after the instructor's explanation regarding
why it was introduced later than other assignments.

on it."
Background context: "I felt there was something different about me from
everybody else."
Participant said she is able to easily approach people, and thinks this
makes her different from her peers.
"I'm a learner - I love learning … and psychology is the biggest mystery
of my life and I can't wait to learn about it."

FINAL PAPER COMMENT: NO EVIDENCE OF THE USE OF
SCHOLARLY SOURCES IN THE FINAL PAPER (NO IN-TEXT
QUOTES OR CITATIONS, NO WORKS CITED PAGE AT THE END
OF THE PAPER).

Participant's general class experience is invigorating and
enlightening.
Participant says she is able to intensely focus on the task at hand
when engaged in her AISP for the class research assignment.
Participant believes she is 'different' from other people around her.
Participant finds it easy to approach people, and believes this sets her
apart from her college peers.
Participant enjoys the learning process and is looking forward to
further study in her chosen academic field (psychology).

Participant's out of class AISP experience is somewhat different from
her in-class experience. Particularly, participant explained she has
trouble focusing on the AISP solely, and also that she feels pressure
because of competing assignments. Finally, participant believes that
minimal input into the assignment will suffice, as she is not invested in
expending a lot of effort in her revision or AISP.

Although participant indicated she had found information for her
final assignment, evidence of this is not found in her final assignment.

Participant stated in high school, he "wasn't really motivated to do a lot
of work, but when I got here [to MidState] … I had to [because college]
was a little more challenging," whereas he felt his high school experience
had not been as challenging, and the workload he had previously
experienced in high school was great increased when he came to college.
In terms of how he deals with the workload increase, participant said
"my time management skills had to be improved a lot - I just wasn't used
to all the workload."

Participant said he struggled at first with the workload transition, but
"I've done a lot better in my [2nd] semester."

Participant feels the course instructor was "very demanding - I liked it and I respected that [the work] was more demanding."
Participant said his high school classes were less demanding, and that the
homework given was minimal compared to that of his workload at
college.
Participant said that he believes the course has better equipped him for
future study: "I feel like it's challenged me a lot more … I feel like I'm
ready for any other class."
Participant said he had not done any scholarly research in high school,
but that he had done some kind of research in elementary school,
involving scholarly resources.
"I don't understand how to cite things - I was just winging it."
Participant indicated he appreciated the instruction in the class regarding
scholarly research, particularly in learning how to use research databases.
Participant stated he read his first essay from the last part of the first
English stretch course (part I of the 2-part stretch series) and in
comparing it to the revised version [completed in this class], he felt he
had definitely gained a lot between the two essays.
In terms of assistance, participant stated he had asked his mother to
review his essay (which he says he asks her to assist him with regularly)
and said "my mom felt I'd improved a lot … I was unsure [before this
assignment] how to do [research and citations] correctly."

Participant's high school experience was very different from his
current college experience, it terms of workload and motivation to
expend effort toward assignments. Particularly, participant feels
much more is required in terms of motivation and workload in the
college environment.
Participant's time management skills had to be improved to
accommodate the increased workload in college.
Participant felt adjusting to the increased workload expectation was
challenging for him at first, but believes he has a better handle on this
in his second semester.
Participant had always believed English was one of his stronger
academic subjects, but believes this class in particular has showed
him ways to improve and therefore he feels more prepared for future
college-level work.
Participant believed the course instructor's work expectations to be
very rigorous, but appreciated the level of rigor and structure.
Participant felt like his high school workload was less demanding, and
that homework expectations were minimal, as opposed to the
workload he has encountered thus far in college.
Participant believes class has both challenged him and prepared him
for future academic work as well.
Participant's only previous experience with scholarly research had
been in elementary school.
Participant did not understand the citation process and described his
completion of same as 'winging it.'
Participant appreciated the in-class instruction on performing
scholarly research and using academic databases.
In comparing the essays from the first part of the course to the second
part of the course (particularly, the very first essay to the revised final
assignment); the participant felt he had improved a great deal in his
skills/abilities over the course.
Participant relies on his mother's assistance and advice for school
assignments.

Participant explained he asked his mother for help because she has a
master's degree, and is a writing coach and instructor at the main campus
of MidState University.
After submitting the paper for the course, participant said of scholarly
research "it's a longer process," and "I'm not comfortable with it right
now and I'm sure I have more to learn about it," which he believes will
happen in future classes.
When doing research for his assignment, participant said he used the
keywords "American family" and "normal," and found a lot of
information about higher income families vs. lower income families.
Of the information he found after his research, participant said he felt
that some of the information made out that 'normal' had to do with
money, to which he responded "That thing about unity, it's not about
money."
When asked why he chose the keywords he used to search for
information, participant said that he was unsure he would find the
information he was looking for under TV. Specifically, he wasn't sure he
would find anything about the Sopranos and his topic (the 'normal'
American family and traditional family values), and "didn't want to veer
off topic" by including too many keywords in his search.
In terms of asking for assistance with the assignment, participant said
that other than meeting with the course instructor, he also turned to his
mother: "She helped me revise."
In terms of who he might consult for assistance with future research
projects, participant said "Maybe the library?" indicated that he thought
there must be people over there who know about database searches.
Participant indicated he is generally motivated to do well in his college
classes.
Participant explained although he was not particularly motivated to do an
in-depth job with the research assignment for this course; he hopes to
improve and learn more about performing scholarly research in the
future.
"I really do care about doing well"
Participant explained he was not particularly focused on the essay itself
for this course, citing competing concerns in other courses as one reason
for not focusing on the essay.
"I'm not a big fan of citations," and said the in-class instruction regarding
citations was quite challenging to comprehend.

Participant's mother has a graduate degree and is a professional
writing coach at a subsidiary campus of MidState.
Participant is still uncomfortable with the scholarly research process
and AISPs after the class experience, and hopes he will learn more
about it in future college classes.
Participant's keyword choice is simple and was chosen based on his
information needs for the project.
Participant was confused by some of the information he found during
his AISP, as it did not coincide with his personal beliefs on the
subject.
Participant's keyword selection process was based on his internal
understanding of what keywords would find what information, and
didn't want to choose too many keywords or different keywords for
his AISP in the fear that he would receive information inappropriate
for his needs.
Participant has sought out the assistance of both the course instructor
and his mother in completing his assignment.
When asked to consider alternate AISP assistance resources for
future classes, participant said perhaps the library could help him
with AISP needs in the future, but seemed unsure about his answer.
Participant is internally motivated to excel in college.
However, for this course (and the final research assignment in
particular), the participant was not motivated to put in a lot of effort either in the AISP, or in the revision. He hopes to learn more about
academic research and completing AISPs in future courses.
Participant does care about succeeding in college.
Participant cited competing course/academic concerns as a reason for
not spending a lot of time or focus on the final assignment for the
course.
Participant does not like citations or the process of creating citations
for an assignment, particularly because he felt that the instruction
about creating and using citations given in class was confusing.

214

Felt that students in the course were given a lot of information to
consume in the abstract, and explained that he doesn't necessarily learn
well this way.
Participant said he learns best in a workshop-style environment, and felt
that the day they were given instruction on citations with examples
would have been better spent composing citations and learning more
about research in the lab environment: "I'm better doing hands-on work,
with experience," and said the time they spent in the lab doing just that
was very helpful to him.
Participant said he feels the class as a whole has made him more capable
of handling the next academic phase.

Stated this is the second time he has taken this course, and hopes to pass
this one (as he failed the previous course by only a few points).
Participant stated he had originally planned to go straight to the main
campus of MidState, but then he received a letter saying he should come
to MidState's regional campus first to improve his grades.
Participant stated that he "had to take this class again," as he had failed
the course previously.
Of this class, participant said that they cover "a lot of the same stuff but
[the instructor] teaches class in a very different way," further explaining
that he found it hard to adjust to the instructor's teaching style.
Of the class, participant said "some stuff is confusing," especially
"talking about grammar and punctuation rules … I had to comprehend
and understand what she meant."
For the final assignment, participant stated he was thinking of revising
either his Hidden Curriculum essay or his Cultural Artifact essay because
he had challenges finding information for his Ad Analysis essay.
Particularly, he said he felt the resources he found for the AA essay were
"too old," and explained he had a lot of difficulty finding resources in the
databases suggested in class.

Participant is a 'hands-on' learner, and when content is taught noncontextually, he finds it more challenging to understand that content.
Participant feels he is a better workshop-style learner, and believed he
was able to comprehend the scholarly research process (including
creating/using citations) much more effectively when students were
given time in the computer lab to implement task.
Participant believes the class has prepared him for future college
work.
Participant fulfills part of the assignment requirement (works cited
page), but does not complete the 'including research in the essay
revision' portion of the assignment in his submission - reiterates his
general confusion with the role of research and citations in the
assignment process.
Participant expresses difficulty he has with completing assignments
when given the opportunity to discuss this during class.
Participant does use lab time to work on research, but finds himself
distracted during this time as well.
Participant had taken and failed this course previously, and hopes he
passes the course this time, although he is nervous about it.
Participant is studying at the regional MidState campus to improve
his grades before transitioning to the main MidState campus, based
on communication of the need to do so from aforementioned campus.
Participant reiterates having failed the course previously and
therefore being required to retake the course.
Although some of the content between the courses is similar,
participant believes the current teaching style to be very different,
and he found it challenging to adjust to the teaching style of the
current instructor.
Participant finds some of the course content confusing, particularly
content covering the mechanics of college-level writing.
Part of the participant's rationale for choosing which essay to revise
for his final assignment was the concern for the lack of current
information he found as it related to other essays he could have
chosen to revise for the final assignment.

215

Participant explained he finds the class research assignment to be very
challenging, but that the most challenging assignment of the course for
him had been the first essay submitted for the course: "It might have
been my worst essay."
In comparison, although participant said he had challenges finding
resources in general, he "[doesn't] think the final essay will be as
difficult," but that in terms of the essay he has selected for revision, that
"it could backfire."

4

Participant said he is very concerned about the final essay, especially
failing the essay, because it would mean he will fail the course again.

4

Participant indicated that for the final assignment in the previous course
he had visited the Writing Center for assistance, but that "it was a big
failure - I don't know if I would go back to them again."

4

When asked about his experience with the WC, participant said he felt
the WC made his work more challenging, because he felt the staff didn't
pay attention to the guidelines for the paper he shared, and that "they
gave wrong advice."

4

When the participant shared his experience with the previous instructor,
the instructor informed the students that the WC had indeed gotten the
guidelines wrong, and that they didn't have to return for assistance.

When discussing his final essay, participant said he had found resources
for his revision, but that he "doesn't remember what they are, really."
When asked more about his selection for revision, participant said "If I
use [CA for the third essay], I feel I could get a good grade but it's a tossup."
In terms of his final paper, participant explained that what may trip him
up academically would be "not hitting the points [the instructor] wants
me to hit.
When asked if he had consulted another resource for his final essay,
participant said he had asked the instructor, but "Asking for teachers'
help can confuse you more at times - make you feel more lost."
Additionally, participant said "the way [the instructor] explains it (i.e. the
parameters of the assignment), it's more confusing."
When prompted to discuss his emotions related to asking for assistance
from the instructor, particularly assistance to complete the final
assignment, participant said "It's completely frustrating. You think you're

Participant found the idea of the research assignment challenging
overall, but also had issues with the essays throughout the course,
particularly the first required essay, which he believed was his worst
assignment.
Participant doesn't believe finding information during his AISP for
the final assignment will be too challenging, but indicated his selection
of the essay to revise could be an unwise selection for him.
Participant was very concerned about his final assignment, because a
failing grade on the assignment would mean a failing grade on the
course (and, as stated earlier, he has already failed this course
previously).
In the previous course, participant sought the assistance of a writing
support service. However, the experience was so disappointing and
unsuccessful to the participant that he expressed doubt about
returning to them for help in the future.
Participant explained his experience with the writing support service
was disappointing because the staff didn't pay attention to the
assignment requirements he shared with them, and that led them to
give him the wrong advice for the assignment.
In sharing his WSS experience with the previous course instructor,
the participant said the instructor agreed with his assessment of their
poor service, and told him and his classmates they did not need to
return to the WSS for assistance.
Participant recalled finding resources for his revision, but not what
the resources were or the information they provided.
Participant believes revising the essay he chose could earn him a good
grade, but that he is also unsure whether this will be the case.
Particularly, participant believes his inability to meet instructor
expectations of the assignment could earn him a poor grade.
Participant indicated he also consulted the instructor for assistance
with the final assignment, but feels her guidance is often confusing to
him, and limits his understanding of what is required of the final
assignment even further.
Participant explained that he was frustrated by the assignment and
the process of asking for help to complete it, because the 'help'

going to get the help you need and then you ask for help and it's
completely confusing."
However, participant stated that after repeated visits for assistance to the
instructor for the final essay asking for further explanation of the
assignment's requirements, that he did find it "a little bit more easily
understanding - [the instructor] broke it down a lot more.

4

In terms of his experience in the class and whether he found it helpful
overall, participant said "A little bit, yes - as a whole, it was helpful - but
the [grammar/punctuation rules] messed everyone up."

4

After the class, participant said he now finds scholarly research "a little
bit easier," and that "I think I have somewhat of an upper hand" if he has
to perform scholarly research in the future.

4

However, in returning conversation to his search for information for the
AA essay, participant said "the only thing that kind of concerns me is
[the inability to find resources] for the Ad Analysis essay."

Participant said he was frustrated with the process as a whole, because "I
had to find keywords to plug in, but nothing came up. It was almost like
a dead end."
Participant explained that as they were primed for the final assignment
by being instructed to find scholarly resources for all their previous
essays, that it was a frustrating process for a number of reasons
especially when the instructor was assisting them.
"Even when she tries to help us, and we still don't find things, I feel like
it will count against us," because he said there is no partial credit for
attempting scholarly research - students either find resources or they
don't.
In talking more about his feelings about scholarly research and its
relationship to the final assignment, participant said "Time isn't exactly
on our side," and that the felt like they had to learn "a lot of stuff in a
short amount of time."
In going through these classes, and learning the facets required for
further academic study, including learning how to do scholarly research,
participant said "Every time we do it [i.e. learn more about academic
requirements for future study], and try to turn ... I feel like a tire stuck in
the mud - I'm trying and trying and not getting anywhere."

provided left him more confused and unsure how to complete the
assignment.
Despite this confusion, participant kept returning to the instructor for
assistance, and that after repeated meetings gained a little more
understanding of the assignment requirements.
Participant believes the class as a whole has been helpful to his
academic progress, but that certain content required in the class (such
as grammar revision) negatively affected his performance and the
performance of his classmates.
Participant felt the class has helped him understand AISPs more
clearly, and believes this will give him an edge when performing
AISPs for future classes.
Despite feeling easier about conducting scholarly research overall,
participant still concerned about the preparation for the final
assignment (i.e. finding research for other essays) in that he didn't
find information for one of them.
Participant explained that his AISP included finding keywords to
search for information, but that he did not find any information, and
felt his AISP led him to a 'dead end.'
Participant feels the preparation for the final assignment (i.e.
practicing 'research skills' by finding scholarly research for other
essays) made the AISP experience frustrating for him, particularly
when the instructor helped students do so.
Participant discussed that his frustration was rooted in the lack of
recognition via a grade for participating in the AISP as a whole,
particularly when the instructor helped students conduct an AISP
and still no information was found - believed this was unfair and
failed to recognize the learning involved with developing an AISP in
the first place.
Participant felt time was a major factor in how he performed in the
final assignment, specifically, that he had too little time to conduct his
AISP for the assignment.
Participant feels that in all the experiences he has had with trying to
learn about scholarly research and AISPs in particular, he never gets
anywhere. Particularly, participant believes scholarly research
continually leads him to 'dead ends,' and that he feels 'like a tire stuck
in the mud.'

"Redoing things doesn't help."

4

As the deadline approached, participant said he feels like "time is
working against us now."

4

Overall, participant said he has found the experience of learning how to
do scholarly research frustrating, even more so in this second class,
because of learning to adjust to a new teaching style, as well as
expanding on the necessary tools required for further academic study.

"I hope I pass this class by some miracle."

FINAL PAPER COMMENT: NO EVIDENCE OF THE USE OF
SCHOLARLY SOURCES IN THE FINAL PAPER (NO IN-TEXT
QUOTES OR CITATIONS, NO WORKS CITED PAGE AT THE END
OF THE PAPER).
Often gets frustrated during class, and doesn't often participate in
discussions.
Does not typically take notes or otherwise engage with material.
Sometimes seems flustered when asked to submit assignments that are
due.
Of the class itself, participant stated "it's pretty simple, some stuff" but
also said that "it's hard to tell when things are due - it would be helpful if
due dates were on the syllabus."
Participant said she finds it hard to keep up with required turn-in dates
because of the lack of information on the syllabus.
Participant said she would prefer if they were "focusing on one kind of
teaching - not focusing on a bunch of different ways."
"I like [the instructor] as a teacher, but not the class - it's not really my
cup of tea."
Of the research assignment for the class, participant said "it's really
confusing," referring back to the teaching style of the course instructor
and the lack of due dates for different assignments due in the course that
makes focusing on one thing difficult for her.
"There are a whole bunch of different parts that are due and you don't
know when they're due."
"I have competing assignments as well" and explains further that
requirements for the course are not explained very well on the syllabus.

Participant believes revisions do not assist in helping him better
understand scholarly research or AISP experiences any better.
Participant believed that time had a negative impact on his ability to
complete the final research assignment.
Participant felt no more comfortable with the scholarly research
process after this class, and explained he felt even more frustrated by
his second experience with this class because of the instructor's
teaching style, and having to learn new things about conducting
research.
Participant is not overly optimistic about his chances for passing the
course a second time.
Participant did not refer to or cite any scholarly sources in his final
paper - a requirement of the revision.
Participant often expresses frustration during class time, and very
rarely participates in class discussions.
Participant seems anxious and disengaged in the class.
Although participant believes most of the course content is simple, she
finds the lack of syllabus guidance on when to submit assignments
frustrating.
This lack of syllabus guidance on submission deadlines made it
challenging for participant to comply with turn-in dates.
Participant believes the instructor's teaching style is too variant, and
this frustrates her.
Although participant likes the instructor, she does not like the class or
the content covered within it.
Participant found the final research assignment as challenging as the
rest of the course, particularly in terms of the instructor's various
teaching styles.
Participant again discussed her anxiety over not knowing when
different elements of assignments are due, because of the lack of due
dates listed in the syllabus.
Participant explained she has assignments to complete in other
courses that compete against the required assignments for this course,
and that the lack of due date guidance on the syllabus for assignments

218
in this course made meeting deadlines even more challenging and
frustrating for her.

Participant couldn't indicate whether she had done this kind of research
in the past or not, but said she did feel like it was more challenging
because of so many other assignments due around the same time in the
class.
Participant said she chose to revise her CA essay for the final
assignment, however, she found the scholarly research portion of the
final assignment challenging for a number of reasons. Although
participant indicated the concept of research was "not that hard," she felt
the instructor "could make it easier and clearer what she wants."
Specifically talking about the lab time students were given to conduct
scholarly research, participant said "[the instructor] just throws us in the
computer lab and I don't know what we're supposed to do."
"If she set dates everything would be easier - if she set dates, we could
focus on one thing at a time."
When asked why she chose to revise her CA essay for the final
assignment, participant answered "because I feel like that was the easiest
essay for me to do," and further indicated she felt it would therefore be
the easiest essay for her to revise.
In terms of performing research to meet the requirements of the final
assignment, participant said "finding information was easy".
She explained further she found her information mostly online, "I
Googled it," but that she also went through a few of the databases
suggested in class.
Participant indicated she used "American norms of gymnastics" and
"stereotypes" as her information search keywords, because she felt that
those keywords would give her the most useful information.
During class lab time, participant said the instructor "suggested
keywords, but didn't explain why," so she chose to continue on with her
own keywords instead of using those suggested by the instructor.
When asked if she had approached anyone for assistance with the final
assignment and/or performing scholarly research, participant said she has
gone to her mother for help because "she's getting her master's, and she
can help with my works cited."
Participant said she often felt "confused" and "stupid" during the class,
particularly because of how the instructor explains things to the class.

Participant was unsure whether she had prior scholarly research or
AISP experience, but believed that multiple assignments due at the
same time in this course made the process more challenging overall.
Participant explained she did not feel she had trouble finding
research during her AISP for the final assignment - rather, she felt
the challenge of the assignment was the lack of clarity of instructor
expectations for the final assignment, and that this made the research
portion more challenging.
Participant felt the instructor provided too little guidance in terms of
what they were to do for their AISPs during lab time.
Participant felt the lack of set due dates for assignments was a
significant challenge to her academic success in the course.
Participant explained that she chose her revision essay based on the
ease of completing the initial essay, and believed that this would
therefore be the easiest assignment for her to revise.
Participant explained that finding scholarly research during her AISP
for the assignment was easy.
Participant used a Google search to find some information for her
essay, but also looked for information in some of the academic
research databases suggested during in-class lab/research time.
Participant explained she selected her keywords based on her
estimation of the keywords' ability to help her find the most useful
information to complete the final assignment.
During the in-class lab time, the instructor suggested keywords for
the participant to use in her search but didn't explain the rationale for
suggesting those keywords, so she conducted her AISP using only her
own keywords.
Participant asked her mother for assistance in completing the final
assignment, because her mother is pursuing a graduate degree, and
the participant believed her mother could help her with the 'works
cited' portion of the assignment in particular.
Participant explained that the instructor's explanations of course
assignments and requirements often made her feel confused and
stupid, and left her with heightened anxiety.

Of the instructor's explanations: "Like when she explained the works
cited - she made it harder than it actually was, which makes it more
confusing."
Participant said during information-seeking, particularly for the final
assignment, that she is "pretty confident" and said she found it easy to
find information for the final assignment.
Participant said it would have been harder to find information for one of
the other essays, because she believed they were harder topics.

"There was a lot of stuff [found when she conducted scholarly research
for the other class essays] that didn't apply to my essay topics."
FINAL PAPER COMMENT: PARTICIPANT INCLUDED A
QUOTE IN THE TEXT OF THE PAPER, BUT WITH NO
AUTHOR/CITATION INFORMATION WHATSOEVER
(IDENTIFIED AS A QUOTE ONLY BY HER USE OF QUOTATION
MARKS). ALSO, ALTHOUGH A REFERENCE OF SOME KIND IS
INCLUDED ON THE FINAL PAGE OF THE PAPER, NEITHER ARE
SCHOLARLY RESOURCES, AND FURTHER, THERE IS NO
CLEAR INDICATION OF A CITATION STYLE USED.
Submits assignments in a timely fashion, consistently presents drafts for
review and correction throughout class.
Uses 'lab time' to search for scholarly information, based on instruction.
Other students in the course consistently approach her for assistance with
assignments, asking for clarifying explanations, reviewing their work for
accuracy, etc.
Participant likes the small class structure because she felt it was "easier
to talk to my professors."
"You can one-on-one talk to [the course instructor] because the class isn't
so big."
"I feel this class is preparing me for other classes."
Participant explained her experience in this class was the first time she
had done any scholarly research, and the assignment "helped me better
understand it," particularly "having it relate to my essays."

Particularly, participant believed the instructor's explanation of the
'works cited' process made her and her classmates more confused
about what was required, and indicated the process was more
challenging than it should be because of this.
Participant is confident in the strength of her academic research skills
in general, and indicated she found it easy to conduct a successful
AISP for the final assignment.
Participant further ratified her choice of the revision essay by stating
she believed finding information for other essays in order to revise
them would have been more challenging, based on the difficulty of the
topics of those essays.
Participant explained she found information when engaging in AISPs
during in-class lab time for her other essays, but that the information
she found was not relevant.

Construct of the use of scholarly research appears to have affected
participant's revision, but the actual implementation of same was not
carried through per assignment requirements.

Participant is vigilant about submitting class assignments on time,
and revising drafts of assignments with instructor assistance
numerous times before final submission.
Participant takes advantage of in-class opportunities to conduct AISP
with instructor assistance.
Participant is respected by her peers, and is often asked for help with
assignments, and with clarifying expectations.
Participant enjoys the smaller class environment because she finds it
easier to communicate with her instructors.
Participant feels she can talk to her instructors one on one because of
the small class sizes.
Participant believes this course is preparing her for future college
courses.
Participant had no scholarly research experience prior to this course,
but she feels the course has helped her understand its purpose,
especially having it housed within the context of revising previous
assignments.

When asked about her experience conducting scholarly research,
participant said "this is really hard," further explaining how difficult it
was for her to find information on some of her topics.
Participant said the course instructor helped her with developing search
strategies, in referring her to specific databases, and showing her how to
reference different keywords.
Participant said the course instructor was "able to answer my questions
and break it down," especially when she had questions about what an
academic journal is, and as she learned more about abstracts and
keywords.
When asked about her opinion on the purpose of scholarly research,
particularly for the class assignment, participant said the articles she
found were "more in detail," and they were "backed by facts rather than
opinions."
Participant said she believes scholarly research "usually comes out of
colleges I guess you could say."
Participant explained that the instructor for this class is the only
professor she talks to in general.
Participant said she has used the Writing Center in the past.
Participant said her First Year Experience [freshman orientation] class
took a trip to the library where they talked about library resources.
Participant said during that class session she remembers they were
shown KentLINK and OhioLINK, and shown how to send articles to
themselves via email.
In response to questions about her experience during the library session,
participant said "I'm sure there was [more/useful information] but not
that I remember - he [the librarian who conducted the session] definitely
talked more than he should have."
Participant said she felt far too much information was presented during
the library session for students to remember in the long term.
Participant explained she felt the scholarly research assignment "helped
me better understand what to do in the future."
Participant said she was unsure where she could go for help with future
assignments, saying "Maybe the professor, or the Writing Center? I'm
sure those people could help me."
When asked to explain her feelings toward the scholarly research
assignment in the class, participant said that when it was first introduced

Participant’s AISP experience for the final assignment has been
particularly challenging, made more so by the fact that she has found
it very difficult to find information on the topics she was exploring.
Instructor helped the participant her develop her AISP, particularly
in terms of helping her select keywords, and showing her different
resources in which to search.
The instructor clarified different elements of scholarly research for
the participant, and answered a lot of her questions about the AISP
experience.
Participant believes/understands scholarly research to be detailed,
fact-based writing.
Participant also believes scholarly research comes from higher
education institutions primarily.
This course's instructor is the only one with whom participant
communicates regularly.
Participant has sought assistance from the writing support service
previously.
Participant visited the on-campus library as a part of her first year
experience/orientation course.
Participant remembers that during the FYE session, they were shown
how to use intra-and-interlibrary catalog systems, and email journal
articles to themselves.
Participant believes a lot of useful information was probably
explained and lost during the FYE library session because a) so much
information was included in the session, and b) the librarian spoke for
far longer and about too much for a single session.
Participant didn't believe the students who attended that session
would be able to retain all the information presented therein.
In terms of the final course assignment, participant believes it helped
her better understand what would be required from scholarly
research in the future.
In terms of where she would go for assistance with future AISPs or
assignments, participant said she would possibly return to the writing
support service, or to the course instructor, but was unsure.
When it was first introduced, participant felt quite overwhelmed by
the concept of conducting an AISP, particularly learning the elements
associated with it (such as developing keywords, etc.).

221
in class, "it was kind of overwhelming because there were so many
things to learn," and that they had to "find all the keywords."

Participant said when the assignment was introduced in class, "there was
no computer in front of us as [the course instructor] explained all the
information - we had to remember what all the information was, and
that's why I wrote it down."
After doing hands-on exercises conducting scholarly research during lab
time, participant said "I feel less overwhelmed now about research," but
indicated she will probably feel overwhelmed again when the students
are given more information about the final essay requirement for the
class.
Of scholarly research in general, participant said "It's a lot of information
and you don't always know what to do with this."
Of the final assignment itself, participant said "this is not a pointless
assignment - I think it will be helpful down the road."
Participant said for future experiences, "we won't have to teach ourself
[sic]."

Participant took many notes when the instructor introduced the AISP
in class because there was no computer in front of them on which they
could implement what was being discussed, and she felt she had to
remember everything that was being discussed so she could
implement it later.
After gaining some experience with creating and implementing an
AISP during in-class lab time, participant felt less anxious about the
process, but said she would most likely feel overwhelmed once more
when all the requirements for the final assignment were introduced in
class.
Participant's AISP experience in the class produced a lot of
information and she was unsure what to do with all of it.
In terms of the final assignment, participant did believe it was
relevant to her continued academic study, and that it would help her
perform similar tasks more effectively in future courses.
Because the instructor assisted the participant in understanding and
implementing the AISP, she feels she won't have to try and learn the
process on her own in future courses.

Participant tries to implement same AISP at home as she used at
school, but lack of access to technology is preventing her from
continuing her AISP and, as she works part time, she explained that
the situation caused her undue anxiety and made her concerned about
completing it.

Participant's keyword
selection process was

didn't want to choose too

specific keywords like
"TV" for his AISP in the
fear that he would

234
Instructor's guidance is often confusing to the
participant, and limits his understanding of
what is required of the final assignment even
further - "Asking for teacher's help can confuse
you more at times - make you feel more lost.
The way she explains it [assignment
requirements], it's more confusing."
Despite this confusion, participant kept
returning to the instructor for assistance, and
after repeated meetings, gained a little more
understanding of the assignment requirements.
Participant is frustrated by the assignment and
the process of asking for help to complete it,
because the 'help' provided left him more
confused and unsure of how to complete the
assignment - "It's completely frustrating. You
think you're going to get the help you need and
then you ask for help and it's completely
confusing."
Participant's frustration was rooted in the lack
of recognition via a grade for participating in
the AISP as a whole, particularly when the
instructor helped students conduct an AISP
and still no information was found - participant
believed this was unfair, and failed to
recognize the learning involved in developing
an AISP in the first place.
Participant said during in-class lab time, the
instructor suggested keywords for her to use,
but didn't explain the rationale for suggesting

In sharing his WSS experience with the
instructor of the previous iteration of this
course, the instructor confirmed the
participant's assessment of the WSS' poor

Participant asked her mother for assistance
in completing the final assignment, because
her mother is pursuing a graduate degree
and she believes her mother can help her
with the 'Works Cited' portion of the
assignment.
Participant has sought assistance from the
WSS previously.

using only her own keywords.
Particularly, participant believed the
instructor's explanation of the 'works cited'
process made her and her classmates more
confused about what was required, and found
the process more challenging than it should
have been because of this.
Participant is vigilant about submitting class
assignments on time and revising drafts of
assignments with instructor assistance,
numerous times before final submission.

Participant takes advantage of in-class
opportunities to conduct AISP with instructor

The instructor helped the participant develop
her AISP, particularly in terms of helping her
select keywords, and showing her different
resources in which to search.
Instructor clarified different elements of
scholarly research for participant, and
answered a lot of her questions about the AISP
experience.
Because the instructor assisted participant in

themselves.
Participant didn't believe the students who
attended the FYE library session would be
able to retain all the information presented
during the session.
In terms of where she would go for
assistance with future AISPs or
assignments, participant would possibly
return to the WSS or to the instructor for
relevant course - "Maybe the professor, or
the Writing Center? I'm sure those people
could help me."

Participant likes the instructor, but does not
like the class or the content covered within
it.
Participant found the final research
assignment as challenging as the rest of the
course, particularly in terms of the
instructor's various teaching styles.
Participant did not feel she had trouble
finding research during the AISP for the
final assignment - rather, she felt the
challenge of the assignment was the lack of
clarity of instructor expectations for the
final assignment, and this made the research
portion more challenging for her.
Participant felt the instructor provided too
little guidance in terms of what they were to
do for their AISPs during lab time. - "[the
instructor] just throws us in the computer
lab and I don't know what we're supposed to
do."
Participant explained that the instructor's
explanations of course assignments and
requirements often made her feel confused
and stupid, and left her with heightened
anxiety.
Participant took many notes when the

Participant's high school workload was less
demanding and homework expectations were
minimal, as opposed to the workload he has
encountered in college thus far.
Participant had taken and failed this course
previously, and although he hopes to pass the
class this time, he is nervous about it - "I
hope I pass this class by some miracle."

Participant originally planned to go straight
to the main campus of MidState University,
but he received a letter saying he should
come to the regional campus first to improve
his grades.

Participant believes the class as a
whole has been helpful to his
academic progress, but certain class
requirements (such as grammar
revision) have negatively affected his
performance.
The class has helped participant
understand how to conduct AISPs
more clearly, and he believes this will
give him an edge when performing
AISPs in the future.
Participant is not overly optimistic
about his chances for passing the
class - "I hope I pass this class by
some miracle."
Participant often expresses frustration
during class time, and very rarely
participates in class discussions.
Participant appears anxious during
class time.
Although participant finds most of
the course content simple, she finds
the lack of due dates on the syllabus
frustrating.
A lack of guidance on assignment
submission deadlines available on the
syllabus made it challenging for
participant to submit assignments on
time.

239
Participant is frustrated by
instructor's variant teaching style.
Participant does not like the class or
the content covered within - "I like
[the instructor] as a teacher, but not
the class - it's not really my cup of
tea."
Participant has high levels of anxiety
over not knowing when different
elements of assignments are due
because of the lack of due dates listed
in the syllabus.
Participant has assignments to
complete in other courses that
compete for her time and focus, and
the lack of due date guidance on the
syllabus for assignments in this
course made meeting deadlines even
more challenging and frustrating for
her - "I have competing assignments
as well."
"If she set dates, everything would be
easier - if she set dates, we could
focus on one thing at a time."
Participant is vigilant about
submitting class assignments on time,
and revising drafts of assignments
with instructor assistance numerous
times before final submission.
Participant enjoys the smaller class
environment because she finds it
easier to communicate with her
instructors.

240
Participant feels she can talk to her
instructors one on one because of the
small class sizes.
Participant had no prior AISP
experience, but feels this course has
helped her better understand its
purpose, especially as it is taught
within the context of revising
previous writing.
Participant communicates only with
this course's instructor regularly.
