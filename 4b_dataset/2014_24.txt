ABSTRACT
UNDERSTANDING NOVICE USERS’ HELP-SEEKING BEHAVIOR IN
GETTING STARTED WITH DIGITAL LIBRARIES: INFLUENCE OF LEARNING
STYLES
by
Chunsheng Huang
The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2014
Under the Supervision of Professor Iris Xie

Users’ information needs have to be fulfilled by providing a well-designed system.
However, end users usually encounter various problems when interacting with
information retrieval (IR) systems and it is even more so for novice users. The most
common problem reported from previous research is that novice users do not know how
to get started even though most IR systems contain help mechanisms. There is a deep gap
between the system’s help function and the user’s need. In order to fill the gap and
provide a better interacting environment, it is necessary to have a clearer picture of the
problem and understand what the novice users’ behaviors are in using IR systems.
The purpose of this study is to identify novice users’ help-seeking behaviors while
they get started with digital libraries and how their learning styles lead to these behaviors.
While a novice user is engaged in the process of interacting with an IR system, he/she
ii

may easily encounter problematic situations and require some kind of help in the search
process. Novice users need to learn how to use a new IR environment by interacting with
help features to fulfill their searching needs. However, many research studies have
demonstrated that the existing help systems in IR systems cannot fully satisfy users’
needs. In addition to the system side problems, users’ characteristics, such as preference
in using help, also play major roles in the decision of using system help. When viewing
help-seeking as a learning activity, learning style is an influential factor that would lead
to different help-seeking behaviors. Learning style deeply influences how students
process information in learning activities, including learning performance, learning
strategy, and learning preferences. Existing research does not seem to consider learning
style and help-seeking together; therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effects of
learning styles on help-seeking interactions in the information seeking and searching
environment.
The study took place in an academic setting, and recruited 60 participants
representing students from different education levels and disciplines. Data were collected
by different methods, including pre-questionnaire, cognitive preference questionnaire,
think-aloud protocol, transaction log, and interview. Both qualitative and quantitative
approaches were employed to analyze data in the study. Qualitative methods were first
applied to explore novice users’ help-seeking approaches as well as to illustrate how
learning styles lead to these approaches. Quantitative methods were followed to test
whether or not learning style would affect help-seeking behaviors and approaches.

iii

Results of this study highlight two findings. First, this study identifies eight types of
help features used by novice users with different learning styles. The quantitative
evidence also verifies the effect of learning styles on help-seeking interactions with help
features. Based on the foundation of the analysis of help features, the study further
identified fifteen help-seeking approaches applied by users with different learning styles
in digital libraries. The broad triangulation approach assumed in this study not only
enables the illustration of novice users’ diversified help-seeking approaches but also
explores and confirms the relationships between different dimensions of learning styles
and help-seeking behaviors. The results also suggest that the designs and delivery of IR
systems, including digital libraries, need to support different learning styles by offering
more engaging processing layouts, diversified input formats, as well as easy-to-perceive
and easy-to-understand modes of help features.

CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTION
1.1

Background
Due to the rapid development of new technologies and explosive growth of Web-

based applications, the amount of scholarly information being digitized is dramatically
increasing. In the academic context, more and more online information retrieval (IR)
systems, e.g. online databases, e-journals, and e-books are already provided in order to
fulfill research and learning purposes. Libraries, as well as academic departments, have
devoted much effort to creating information systems, i.e., digital libraries (DLs), to
preserving their print resources digitally, and to providing access and services online.
There is no standard IR system, which causes academic users to find it much more
difficult and challenging to search for information to accomplish their academic purposes.
They have to not only interact with various topics of collections but also adapt to diverse
interfaces designs that they are not familiar with. They need to solve encountered
problems and learn how to use the new IR systems. The main purpose of IR research is to
investigate how to effectively assist users in learning new information resources or
technology when searching for information.

1.2

Research Problem and Research Question
It is noted that previous research in IR has expanded from a system-centered approach

to a user-centered cognitive approach to achieve the goal of assisting users in a searching
environment. A user-centered cognitive approach incorporates users’ characteristics of

2
knowledge, interest, and preference into research consideration (Ingwersen & Jarvelin,
2005). These human factors are clearly key issues for the development of Web-based
applications and have led relevant research to grow significantly in the past decades.
Therefore, many researchers adopted user-centered cognitive approach in their system
design models (Ford, 2004; Ingwersen & Jarvelin, 2005; Saracevic, Spink, & Wu, 1997;
Wilson, 1999; Xie, 2008). Marchionini (1995) described these personal characteristics as
‘personal information infrastructure’, which means an individual person’s mental
structure based on his/her own personal collection of abilities, experience, and other
cognitive resources. Without the personal information infrastructure, there is no way for
an individual to gather, use, or communicate information in any context. In other words,
the cognitive differences influence how users seek and retrieve information. It is through
the further understanding of human cognitive factors and their relationships with the usersystem interactions that a better supportive design of IR system can be created.
Although previous IR research has pointed out the importance of ‘cognition’ as an
influential factor in the interactive behavior between system and user, the detailed
dimensions and specific constructs of cognition related to information seeking and
searching have not been completely identified and need further exploration. In echoing
the importance of the cognitive influence, many researchers began to explore information
seeking and searching as a learning process and proposed information behavior models,
which incorporates cognitive concepts such as learning styles into the design (Ford, 2004;
Wilson, 1997; Wilson, 1999).

3
In the model of information behavior, Wilson (1997) recognized the close association
between information processing and learning and integrated cognitive and psychological
characteristics into the understanding of the information searching situation and user need.
According to Wilson, the context of the information need leads to information seeking behavior
which is mediated or impacted by intervening variables. Wilson pointed out that users’ personal
characteristics are key intervening variables that would negatively influence information
seeking and stated “the barriers, particularly those at the level of the person, may act to prevent
the initial emergence of a coping strategy, or may intervene between the acquisition of
information and its use”. Information seeking behavior is directly affected by an individual’s
cognitive processes, which are task-specific, micro, immediate, and situational and are executed
using different styles of approaches to accomplish different task types and learning objectives.
One of the intervening variables of information seeking is the individual’s psychological trait cognitive/learning style - which deeply influences how students process information in learning
activities, including learning performance, learning strategy, and learning preferences. Learning
styles influence how users process information, including their choice of search strategies and
preferred system features. Several researchers have studied the effects of learning style and the
associated dimensions on users’ reactions to information organization and representation, search
strategy, and search performance (Ford, 2005; Ford, Miller, & Moss, 2005a; Ford, Miller, &
Moss, 2005b; Ford, Eaglestone, Madden, & Whittle, 2009; Frias-Martinez, Chen, Macredie, &
Liu, 2007; Lee, Cheng, Rai, & Depickere, 2005; Palmquist & Kim, 2000; Tenopir, Wang,
Zhang, Simmons, & Pollard, 2008; Wang, Hawk, & Tenopir, 2000).
Since the number of new IR systems shows significant growth during recent years, users
may not be familiar with many of them. When situated in totally strange searching

4
environments, academic users usually encounter various problems and need to seek help.
However, many research studies have demonstrated that the existing help systems in IR systems
cannot fully satisfy users’ needs. While viewing help systems as important, people generally
find these systems to be ineffective in a variety of areas. As a result, they tend to use help
mechanisms less frequently (Cool & Xie, 2004; Mansourian, 2008).
According to Xie & Cool (2009), help-seeking refers to the situation where a user is
engaged in the process of interacting with an IR system, and he/she encounters a
problematic situation and needs some kind of help to complete the search process. In
information retrieval environments, help-seeking represents a mini information search
process. Therefore, cognitive factors that influence information searching may also affect
users’ help-seeking behavior.
It is generally accepted that the problematic situation is worsened when a novice user
faces a new environment, and Digital libraries (DLs) are relatively newly developed
systems (Nahl, 1999). Novice users usually encounter many kinds of problems and have
to learn how to search DLs by interacting with their help features. Most DLs contain
certain help mechanisms which are actually reported to be the least used functions. This
may be the fault of DL systems, whose help contents and structures are hard to use. There
is a deep gap between the system’s help features and novice users’ need (Xie & Cool,
2009). In addition to the system side problems, users’ characteristics, such as users’
motivation state, preference in using help, and cognitive state, also play major roles in the
decision of using system help (Dworman & Rosenbaum, 2004).

5
Although previous research has addressed the issues of help-seeking and various
cognitive factors, they are being investigated separately. There are two main limitations
within the previous research: 1) while there are studies focusing on how cognitive factors
affect search behaviors, less research focuses on their influence on help-seeking; 2) there
is even less research examining this issue in DL environments. In order to fill the gap and
provide a better interacting environment, it is necessary to have a clearer picture and
understand what the novice users’ help-seeking approaches are when using DLs.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify whether learning style affects novice
users’ help-seeking behaviors while they get started with digital libraries and how the
related cognitive factors lead to these approaches.
The specific research questions are listed below:
RQ 1. What are the types of help features that novice users with different
learning styles use in digital libraries?
RQ 2. Is there a significant difference in novice users’ help feature use based
on their learning styles?
RQ 3. What are the help-seeking approaches that novice users with different
learning styles apply in digital libraries?
The associated null hypotheses for research question two (RQ 2) are written in a
preliminary form as shown in this section. For RQ 2, the learning styles were investigated
more specifically according to the associated four dimensions, including (1) Processing
dimension (Active/Reflective), (2) Input dimension (Visual/Verbal), (3) Perceiving

6
dimension (Sensing/Intuitive), and (4) Understanding dimension (Sequential/Global)
(Felder & Silverman, 1988; Felder & Soloman, 1991). The help-seeking behaviors were
investigated with specific type of Help Feature identified later in this study. The
hypotheses for RQ 2 are:
Hypothesis 2.1a There is no significant difference in the frequency of using
Help Features between Active and Reflective users.
Hypothesis 2.1b There is no significant difference in the time of using Help
Features between Active and Reflective users.
Hypothesis 2.1c There is no significant difference in the number of types of
Help Features used between Active and Reflective users.
Hypothesis 2.2a There is no significant difference in the frequency of using
Help Features between Visual and Verbal users.
Hypothesis 2.2b There is no significant difference in the time of using Help
Features between Visual and Verbal users.
Hypothesis 2.2c There is no significant difference in the number of types of
Help Features used between Visual and Verbal users.
Hypothesis 2.3a There is no significant difference in the frequency of using
Help Features between Sensing and Intuitive users.
Hypothesis 2.3b There is no significant difference in the time of using Help
Features between Sensing and Intuitive users.
Hypothesis 2.3c There is no significant difference in the number of types of
Help Features used between Sensing and Intuitive users.
Hypothesis 2.4a There is no significant difference in the frequency of using
Help Features between Sequential and Global users.
Hypothesis 2.4b There is no significant difference in the time of using Help
Features between Sequential and Global users.
Hypothesis 2.4c There is no significant difference in the number of types of
Help Features used between Sequential and Global users.

1.3

Research Design
A user study was designed to address the proposed research questions and associated

hypotheses. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to systematically
collect and analyze the data. Around 60 novice users were recruited in this study,
including mainly undergraduate and graduate students. Since the study was carried out in
an academic setting, these participants represent general academic users with different
ages, genders, ethnicities, educational levels, educational disciplines, computer skills, and
other demographic characteristics. Two digital libraries (DLs) are selected for this study:
the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee Digital Collection (UWMDC)
(http://www4.uwm.edu/libraries/digilib/) and the Library of Congress Digital Collection
(LOCDC) (http://loc.gov/ Library/libarch-gidital.html). The main reason for selecting
these two DLs is that they provide rich and related content with multimedia formats. Such
content represents the type of information general academic users might be interested in.
Most importantly, both DLs facilitate information seeking of novice users with complete
and varying help features. Multiple methods were employed in this study to collect both
qualitative and quantitative data, including pre-questionnaires, cognitive instruments,
think-aloud protocol, transaction log, and post-interview. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses were included in the analysis of users’ help-seeking interaction and
their relationships with learning style, including descriptive analysis, statistical testing,
and open coding. Results from qualitative and quantitative methods were analyzed,
connected, and interpreted to better understand novice users’ help-seeking behaviors.

8

1.4

Significance of the Study
The study aims to contribute to more understanding of novice users’ help-seeking

behaviors and provide a theoretical model and design principles for developing helpful IR
systems. As Meadows (2008) stated, “a proper understanding of human information
retrieval is now seen as involving an examination of cognitive factors”. He further
pointed out more understanding of retrieval systems must allow a high level of interactive
input from the information seeker. Even though previous research has identified many
influential cognitive factors of information retrieval, very limited studies have focused on
combining learning-related cognitive factors and their relationships with help-seeking
behaviors. The cognitive factors and their impact on help seeking behaviors in learning
and problem solving have been confirmed and therefore can also be applied in an IR
environment. As stated earlier, various dimensions of learning style may influence how
users choose search strategies and preferred system help features in terms of content
organization and presentation format. These different dimensions and factors can be
investigated to further explore how they are interwoven with users’ help-seeking
behaviors. It is hoped that the results of this research will help to design a user model that
better facilitates users’ different preferences and cognitive states. More specifically, the
implication is to integrate these factors into the help-seeking process and develop a
micro-user model, which serves as the theoretical basis to enhance retrieval effectiveness
by compensating for cognitive weaknesses on the part of novice users (Gorrell et al.,
2009).

9
In addition, an effective IR system interface needs to provide great affordance and
facilitate correct cognitive development by presenting appropriate messages/clues and
providing context-sensitive help based on detected user characteristics or behaviors
(Wang et al., 2000). To achieve the affordance and facilitation, there is a need to provide
personalization. Personalization can be delivered by providing adaptivity (able to adapt)
or adaptability (capable of being adapted). In an adaptive system, users’ cognitive
preference and efficacy can be identified by either monitoring their interactive behaviors
or by obtaining feedback directly from users. In an adaptive system, users’ cognitive
preferences and styles can be identified by either monitoring his/her behavior with data
mining techniques or by obtaining this information from external surveys. Once the users’
cognitive styles can be detected, the design of help features in IR systems can be
automatically changed to match the preferences of each individual without the user’s
attention. For example, the observation of users’ interactive preference can be used to
provide personalized help by re-ranking search results or reformulating queries, thus
helping users complete their tasks more effectively and efficiently (Liu & Belkin, 2011).
In a system with adaptability, users are allowed to modify the design of an IR system
themselves based on their own preference. Therefore, results of this research can be used
to recommend cognitive design principles. The purpose of the recommendation is to
integrate these principles into the development of help features and better support users’
interactions with IR systems.

Help-seeking refers to situations in which individuals encounter problems in the process
of information seeking and searching. Individuals may try to seek help, either from an IR
system, a human or other sources to solve the problems.
Help-feature
Help-feature refers to the features provided by IR systems that assist users in solving their
problems in the search process.
Help-seeking approaches
Help-seeking approaches refer to the methods or steps taken by IR system users in setting
about to resolve a searching problem.
Learning Style
Learning style refers to the preference that an individual may have for processing
information in a particular way when carrying out a learning activity.
Learning Style Dimension of ILS

CHAPTER TWO REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
2.1.

Introduction

The following chapter discusses the theoretical framework that shaped the study and
explores the literature associated with it. The major source of previous research is from
information studies with the emphasis on user-centered information retrieval.
Perspectives of education are also blended and integrated into this review, particularly in
the fields of educational psychology and human cognition. Information studies and
education are separate academic disciplines, but they share a mission of assisting users in
learning different information sources or technology.
Information retrieval is a general concept that encompasses both information seeking
and information searching. Information seeking is “the purposive seeking for information
as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal” (Wilson, 2000). Individuals may interact
with either manual information systems or computer-based systems within a context.
Within the pre-existing external context, people would form a need to search for
information. Therefore, researchers have conducted studies of information seekers in
different occupations, roles, and other contextual characteristics (Case, 2006). According
to Wilson (2000), “Information searching behavior is the ‘micro-level’ of behavior
employed by the searcher in interacting with information systems of all kinds. It consists
of all the interactions with the system, whether at the level of human computer interaction
(for example, use of the mouse and clicks on links) or at the intellectual level (for
example, adopting a Boolean search strategy or determining the criteria for deciding

13
which of two books selected from adjacent places on a library shelf is most useful),
which will also involve mental acts, such as judging the relevance of data or information
retrieved.” Within the micro level, more attention is paid to the interactions between the
system and users. Due to the emergence of the user-centered approach toward IR research,
more emphases have been place on cognition, including human knowledge and skills,
attitude and motivation, and other related cognitive factors.
For the following sections, previous literature about general human cognition factors
as well as cognitive factors in relation to help-seeking were briefly examined followed by
a review of help-seeking. This chapter begins with the presentation of general key
concepts of cognitive factors related to information retrieval. Then, previous literature of
learning style and associated impacts on learning and information retrieval are reviewed.
Next, help-seeking theories developed in both educational and information retrieving
settings were examined. The help-seeking theories and related research from both fields
serve as a theoretical framework for this dissertation research. Finally, the last section
summarizes this chapter.

2.2.

Cognitive Factors for Information Retrieval

As noted by previous researchers, IR studies have shifted from system-centered
approach to user-centered approach with the emergence of Web-based information
applications. Human factors are clearly key issues for the development of Web-based
applications, leading research involving cognitive factors to grow significantly in the past

14
decade. Therefore, a user-centered cognitive approach may consider users’ knowledge,
interests, and preference as it relates to system design (Ingwersen & Jarvelin, 2005).
The term ‘cognition’ refers to the act of knowing, which includes processing of
information, applying knowledge, and changing preferences (Bandura, 1997; Coren,
Ward, & Enns, 1999). Other scholars define ‘cognition’ from a learning perspective and
state “cognition refers to thinking and mental processes humans use to make decisions,
understand new information or experiences, and learn new things” (Weinstein & Acee,
2008). The mental processes of human cognition are composed of various attributes,
including memory, association, concept formation, language, attention, perception,
motivation, action, problem solving and mental imagery. Based on perspectives within
different contexts, these cognition processes have been analyzed in the fields of
linguistics, anesthesia, neurology, psychology, philosophy, anthropology, computer
science, and education. Many IR scholars also recognize several attributes of human
cognition as influential factors in studying information searching behavior.
In IR research, the most widely studied cognition attribute is knowledge state.
Marchionini (1995) defined information seeking and searching as “a process in which
humans purposefully engage in order to change their state of knowledge” (p. 5). However,
not only have the cognitive differences in knowledge state been identified as a vital
intervening variable in information-seeking behavior and performance, but many
researchers have also placed general cognition concepts, including cognitive preference
and other motivational and psychological states, as major factors influencing searching
behaviors in their IR theoretical models. These models include Ingwersen’s Cognitive

15
Model, Saracevic’s Stratified Model, Wilson’s Information-Seeking Behavior Model and
Xie’s Planned-Situational Interactive IR Model (Ford, 2004; Ingwersen & Jarvelin, 2005;
Saracevic et al., 1997; Wilson, 1999; Xie, 2008).
Based on the theoretical models, many broad cognitive factors have been investigated
in regard to their impact on users’ IR behaviors. In Saracevic’s stratified model of IR
interaction, the interaction between the two sides of users and system is taken into
account. On the user side of the model, three levels of interaction were presented:
cognitive, affective, and situational levels. At the first cognitive level, based on users’
current state of knowledge, they have to constantly search or browse for information,
navigate through the organization of the content, make judgment about the retrieved
results. The interaction is between the cognitive structure of users and texts and related
representations. At the middle level, users have to interact with their personal affective
factors, which include intentions, beliefs, and motivations (Saracevic et al., 1997). The
first two levels of interaction are key parts, representing a broader sense of ‘cognition’,
which determines how users interact with the system. A similar idea is raised in
Marchionini’s suggestion that ‘attitude’ is an integral part of “personal information
infrastructure” by stating that “throughout our lives we develop knowledge, skills, and
attitudes that allow us to seek and use information”. According to Marchionini, the
development and change of an individual person’s mental structure needs to be based on
his/her own personal collection of abilities, experience, and other cognitive resources.
Without the personal information infrastructure, there is no way for an individual to
gather, use, or communicate information in any context (G. Marchionini, 1995).

16

2.2.1 Knowledge and Skills
Previous research has examined the impact of different types of knowledge on
information retrieval behavior. The most extensively investigated factor in IR fields is
human knowledge. The related research typically uses the difference between novices
and experts to demonstrate the effects of the knowledge and skills that users bring to the
retrieval context. Three types of knowledge and skills are proposed in Marchionini’s
personal information infrastructure: problem domain, search system, and information
searching. Among the three types of knowledge and skills, domain knowledge has been
studied most extensively in the information science community. Domain knowledge is
concerned with the knowledge of the ‘subject’ of the search tasks, either a need that is
self-generated or given by a certain context. Before any search can be initiated, users
need to be familiar with the subject of interest and the vocabulary of the task domain
(Lazonder, Biemans, & Wopereis, 2000). Studies of domain expertise have highlighted
several differences between domain experts and non-experts in using library OPAC
system, online databases, digital libraries, and Web search engines. These behavioral
differences include: (1) search query attributes: search term selection (Allen, 1991;
Duggan & Payne, 2008; Shute & Smith, 1993; Vakkari, Pennanen, & Serola, 2003;
Vakkari, 2002; White, Dumais, & Teevan, 2009), query reformulation strategies
(Hembrooke, Granka, Gay, & Liddy, 2005), and the number and length of queries
(Duggan & Payne, 2008; Freund & Toms, 2006; Hembrooke et al., 2005; Hsieh-Yee,
1993; Hölscher & Strube, 2000; Marchionini, 1989; Wildemuth, 2004; Zhang,
Anghelescu, & Yuan, 2005); (2) search strategies and tactics: Web site selection
(Lazonder et al., 2000; White et al., 2009; Duggan & Payne, 2008), goal sequencing

17
(Bhavnani, 2002) and search tactics (Carmel, Crawford, & Chen, 1992; Vakkari, 2001;
Wildemuth, 2004); and (3) search outcomes: task completion time (Bhavnani, 2001;
Duggan & Payne, 2008; Lazonder et al., 2000; McDonald & Stevenson, 1998; Vibert et
al., 2009), reading time (Kelly & Cool, 2002), search accuracy and success (Duggan &
Payne, 2008; Kang, 2010; Lazonder et al., 2000; White et al., 2009), and search
efficiency and effectiveness (Kelly & Cool, 2002, Zhang et al., 2005). In summary,
domain experts are found to use domain specific vocabularies in their queries, adopt goaloriented strategies, and be more successful in searching.
In addition to domain knowledge, system knowledge also plays an important role for
users to effectively interact with IR systems. Search knowledge, including system
knowledge and searching skills, helps users know general search skills and understand
how particular a IR system works. It is also suggested that users should have various
skills and knowledge with the system, including skills in navigating through and
searching in the information system and knowledge of what content is available and how
the information is organized (Chen, Houston, Sewell, & Schatz, 1998; Dimitroff, 1992).
Based on previous research, experienced users are better than novice users in online
searching behaviors. In a study comparing novice searchers with experts, Tabatabai &
Shore (2005) revealed specific actions that are associated with experts’ success in Web
searching. These actions are: (1) evaluating Web sites with clear criteria, (2) not
excessively navigating, (3) reflecting on strategies and monitoring progress, (4) having
background knowledge about information seeking, and (5) approaching the search with a
positive attitude. More researchers also pointed out the effect of system knowledge in
different search behaviors, such as locating Web sites (Lazonder et al., 2000; Palmquist

18
& Kim, 2000), search strategies (Ellis & Haugan, 1997; Marchionini, Dwiggins, Katz, &
Lin, 1993), systematically reformulating queries (Fields, Keith, & Blandford, 2005;
Hsieh-Yee, 1993), monitoring the search process (Howard, 1982; Hsieh-Yee, 1993;
Sutcliffe, Ennis, & Watkinson, 2000; Yuan, 1997), and search outcomes (de Bliek et al.,
1993; de Bliek et al., 1994; Yuan, 1997).
The purpose of previous literature focused mainly on understanding the information
searching behavior of experts of either domain or system knowledge. With this
understanding, it is hoped to improve the design of IR systems and better facilitate the
interaction between IR systems and novice users. However, less is known about novice
users, who are the majority of IR systems users. Without the subject domain knowledge
and required searching skills and experiences, many novice users still find IR systems
hard to use.

2.2.2 Attitude, Motivation, and Related Factors
As stated earlier, Marchionini also identified attitude in the personal information
infrastructure that interacts directly with information seeking. According to Marchionini,
“attitude such as motivation, confidence, tenacity, tolerance for ambiguity and
uncertainty, curiosity, and preferences for social interaction and media” determine when
and how people apply information seeking knowledge and skills (Marchionini, 1995).
Other researchers echoed a similar view and involved motivational factors in their models
of information seeking. In Wilson’s 1999 theoretical and classical model of information
behavior, several behavior theories were integrated to illustrate the relationships between
information-seeking behavior, psychological attributes as well as other factors. These

19
factors were transferred from the research advancement in social cognitive learning,
decision making, psychology, and communication. In the information behavior model,
Wilson emphasized that the need to seek information is not only driven by the
information environment and user cognition, but is also impacted by users’ psychological
and motivational states (Wilson, 1999). Nahl (2004; 2005) conducted a series of
empirical studies to investigate motivational factors, e.g. self-efficacy and optimism, and
their impacts on information behaviors on Internet. She further integrated theories of
different fields in psychology and cognitive science and proposed a conceptual
framework to depict the interaction between human and system. This framework has the
emphasis on the specific account of how different cognitive domains of humans are interdependent in processing and using information. These cognitive domains include
cognitive coping skills, self-efficacy, optimism, and negative feelings of uncertainty,
irritation, and frustration.
In Sense-Making Methodology, Dervin specifically enumerated factors, such as
‘attitudes’, ‘feelings’, and ‘beliefs’, as bridging elements of information seeking (Dervin
& Reinhard, 2007). She differentiated previous studies into different conceptualizations
and their relationship to information seeking from previous research. Among the
conceptualizations, the first group focuses on different information seeking situations,
tasks, or contexts that can cause different feelings, either positive satisfaction or negative
anxiety (Bilal, 2000; Bilal, 2002; Wang & Tenopir, 1998; Wilson, Ford, & Ellis, 2002).
The second group, on the other hand, conceptualizes attitudes and beliefs as the source of
impact toward information searching behaviors (Heinstrm, 2005; Julien & Michels, 2000;
Nahl, 1998; Nahl, 2004; Nahl, 2005; Tenopir, 1994). While some researchers

20
conceptualize attitudes and beliefs as a motivational state that can either activate or
inhibit searching for information, others regard attitudes and beliefs as the driving forces
leading to different goals and activities.

2.2.3 Other Cognitive Factors
Other cognitive factors that have also been investigated in IR research include
problem solving style/ability (Kim & Allen, 2002; Wilson, 1997), attribution theory
(Nahl, 2004), epistemological beliefs (Whitmire, 2003), language and reading (Bowler,
2010b), metacognition (Bowler, 2010c; Gorrell, Eaglestone, Ford, Holdridge, & Madden,
2009), and self-regulation (Bowler, 2010a).
One of the studies mentioned above was conducted by Kim & Allen (2002), which
investigates the influence of problem-solving style on Web searching behavior. In their
study, Kim & Allen found that problem-solving style interacted with and influenced the
use of keyword searching as well as the number of Web pages viewed. Other studies
explored the metacognition and self-regulation and their impacts on information seeking
and searching behaviors.
Gorrell and his colleagues (2009) reported a project aiming to build interventional
strategies into the design of IR systems to bring about and strengthen metacognitive skills.
In such a ‘metacognitively aware’ IR system, an individual searcher’s levels of
metacognitive awareness and skills can be assessed. Based on the evaluation results, IR
systems can offer specific intervention strategies designed to compensate for
metacognitive weaknesses. In the first phase of the project, the research team constructed

21
a taxonomy of metacognition. In their taxonomy, the core metacognitive skills selected
are schema-training, planning, monitoring, evaluation and transfer. Results of the study
showed high overall use of metacognitive strategies among respondents. In addition,
there were significant differences reported in the metacognition usage in relation to age,
gender and discipline. Bowler (2010c) also identified attributes of metacognitive
knowledge related to the information search process in school-based tasks. Thirteen
attributes of metacognition knowledge were identified in the study, which are balancing,
building a base, changing course, communicating, connecting, knowing that you don't
know, knowing your strengths and weaknesses, parallel thinking, reflecting, scaffolding,
understanding curiosity, understanding memory, understanding time, and effort.
In another study, Bowler (2010a) conducted a study revealing adolescents behavioral
pattern in relation to self-regulation of curiosity. Results of her study showed that the
curiosity experienced by adolescents during the search process was accompanied by both
positive and negative feelings. Such feelings, e.g. pleasure and pain, need to be selfregulated in order to navigate a pathway through the search process. The self-regulation
of curiosity was a clear and distinct strategy related to understanding one’s own curiosity
and the feelings attached to it.

2.3.

Cognitive Factors in Relation to Help-Seeking as a Learning

Process

Although previous IR research has pointed out the importance of cognition as an influential
factor in the interaction behavior between system and user, the detailed dimensions and specific

22
constructs of cognition were not completely identified and thus need to be further explored.
Current knowledge is still far from understanding the complexity of interactive behavior. In
echoing the importance of the cognitive influence, many researchers began to explore
information seeking and searching as a learning process using interdisciplinary perspectives of
cognition research from education and cognitive psychology (Wilson, 1997; Wilson, 1999, Ford,
2004).
In the model of information behavior, Wilson (1997) recognized the close association
between information processing and learning. He integrated cognitive and psychological
characteristics into the understanding of search situations and user need. According to Wilson,
the context of the information need leads to information seeking behavior which is mediated by
activating mechanisms and other intervening variables. According to Wilson, users’ personal
characteristics are the key intervening variable that would negatively influence information
seeking and stated that “the barriers, particularly those at the level of the person, may act to
prevent the initial emergence of a coping strategy, or may intervene between the acquisition of
information and its use”. Information seeking behavior is directly affected by an individual’s
cognitive processes, which are task-specific, micro, immediate, and situational and are executed
using different style of approaches to accomplish different task types and learning objectives.
One of the intervening variables of information seeking is the individual’s psychological trait,
cognitive/learning style, which deeply influences how students process information in learning
activities, including learning performance, learning strategy, and learning preferences.
Since the number of new IR systems shows an explosive growth during past years, users
may not be familiar with them. When being situated in totally new searching environments,

23
users usually encounter various problems and need to seek help. The problematic situation
becomes even worse for novice users. With the learning orientation, these models can be
adopted to provide additional understanding of the problematic situations encountered by
novice users, who does not have either appropriate knowledge of or experience with the new IR
system. Based on the theories stated above, the learning style is selected as the focused
dimension to understand novice users’ help-seeking behavior.
In summary, previous research has explored different cognitive factors, including
cognitive processes of strategy use and motivational states. However, the factors are
investigated either in isolation or along with one other component, very few studies ever
explored the factor. After reviewing all the literature related to cognitive information
behavior models, this study aims to identify how learning style would affect information
retrieval behavior, specifically help-seeking behaviors.

2.3.1 Learning Style
The first concept of cognition that attracts many researchers’ attention is cognitive
style. Cognitive style refers to a individual’s preferred way of processing information
(Sternberg, 2001). Individuals may process all sorts of information across many areas of
activity. Cognitive style unconsciously serves as an adaptive control mechanism between
the inner self-need and externally interacting environment. The cognitive style also
attracted many researchers in the field of information retrieval (Wildemuth, 2009). Yuan
& Meadow (1999) investigated the use of variables by authors who reported on studies of
IR systems. They pointed out that cognitive/learning style serves as one of the key
characteristics to the variable of human individual differences and learning. Based on

24
previous research, Xie (2008) also identified cognitive style and searching style as one of
major components of “personal information infrastructure” in the Planned-Situational
Interactive IR model.
More recently, attention has turned to cognitive styles in learning activities. It is also well
accepted to adopt the term ‘learning style’ in educational research. Learning styles are used to
portray individual differences in the preferred way of processing information or approach
learning (Dunning, 2008). Many learning styles were developed to describe and classify
learners (Sternberg & Grigorenko, 1997; Zhang & Sternberg, 2005). For example, FieldDependent /Field-Independence (Witkin, 1973), Wholist/Analytic and Verbalizer/Imager
(Riding & Cheema, 1991), Active/Reflective and Sensing/Intuitive (Felder & Silverman, 1988;
Kolb & Kolb, 2005) were used to categorize learners according to how they perceive, organize,
and process information.
Several major dimensions will briefly be discussed in the following section, including FieldDependence/ Field-Independence, Wholist/Analytic, Verbal/Imagery, processing, perception,
input, and understanding.
Field Dependence / Field Independence (FD/FI) dimension
Among the various dimensions, Field Dependent/Field Independent (FD/FI) is
probably the dimension most often studied. When processing incoming material, FI
individuals would impose their own structure, take individual elements out of context,
and employ analytical approaches toward learning, whereas FD persons would accept

25
ideas presented to them, focus on global experience, adopt more of an observer role, and
easily be distracted by unimportant, yet more dominant cues.
Whilst field dependent individuals have a preference to learn in groups and to interact
frequently with one another as well as the teacher, field independent learners may
respond better to more independent and more individualized approaches. Field
independent learners are more likely to have self-defined goals and to respond to intrinsic
reinforcement, whilst field dependent learners require more extrinsic reinforcement and
more structured work by the teacher. Whereas the field independent learners prefer to
structure their own learning, and like to develop their own learning strategies, field
dependent learners may need more assistance in problem-solving strategies or more exact
definitions of performance outcomes (Witkin, Moore, Goodenough, & Cox, 1977). Field
independent individuals are more able to deal with situations requiring impersonal
analysis whilst field dependent individuals are better equipped to deal with situations
requiring social perceptiveness and interpersonal skills.
Wholist/Analytic and the Verbal/Imagery dimensions
Riding and Chema (1991) studied many constructs and concluded that styles can be
classified into two principal groups: the Wholist/Analytic and the Verbal/Imagery
dimensions. The Wholist/Analytic dimension describes whether an individual tends to
organize and perceive information in whole or in parts. This dimension is quite
equivalent to Field dependent/ Independence. The Verbal/Verbal dimension characterizes
whether people are inclined to perform better in tasks or situations that require the
associated form of information represented in visual or verbal form (Riding, 2001).

26
Dimensions of Index of Learning Styles
While most learning style theories classify learners into few groups, the Index of
Learning Styles (ILS) describes learners in more detailed dimensions (Felder &
Silverman, 1988; Felder & Soloman, 1991; Felder & Brent, 2005). Table 2.1 lists the
dimensions of learning styles of ILS.
Table 2.1 Dimensions of Learning Styles of ILS
Learning Styles of ILS
Processing
Input
Perception
Understanding

Active
Reflective
Visual
Verbal
Sensing
Intuitive
Sequential
Global

In the ILS model, there are four proposed scales and associated dimensions:
Active/Reflective, Visual/Verbal, Sensing/Intuitive, and Sequential/Global. The first
dimension distinguishes between an active and a reflective way of processing information.
The second, Visual-Verbal dimension deals with the preferred sensory channel in
providing information. The third dimension covers a sensing versus intuitive approach of
perceiving information. For the fourth dimension, learners are characterized according to
their sequential or global ways of understanding information.
Learning style and learning
The level of learning style was positively correlated to academic performance. Witkin
et al.’s (Witkin, Oltman, Raskin, & Karp, 1971) field dependence/field independence has
also been found to be an important factor influencing performance of students in different

27
learning contexts, including business education, language acquisition, problem solving,
and programming. Au (1997) conducted a study investigating the relationships between
learning style and learning performance of college business majors. Using a sample of
103 students, Au concluded that FI business students tend to outperform their FD peers
across all forms of assessment, which included a multiple choice test, a written report,
and a final examination. In a foreign language learning context, Hansen and Stansfield
(1981) found that FI learners in a Spanish class learned more effectively, as measured by
achievement scores, than FD learners. Similar results were also found in computer-based
learning environments. For example, compared with FD learners, FI learners do better in
problem solving performance (Williams, 2001) and programming performance (Johnson
& Kane, 1992).
Other learning styles were also found to be closely associated with learning
performance (Backhaus & Liff, 2007; McManus, Richards, Winder, & Sproston, 1998;
Riding, 2001; Zhang, 2002; Zhang, 2008). With second language learning, Riding et al.
(Riding, Grimley, Dahraei, & Banner, 2003) asked the second-language teachers of
French or German to rate learning of their 12-year-old pupils on a 5-point scale from very
poor to very good. Overall, the Verbalizers were rated higher than that of Imagers. In a
more recent study, Backhaus and Liff (2007) also examined the role of learning style and
academic performance in management education. The result of their study revealed a
relationship between analytical style and grade point average.
In addition to academic performance, learning style is closely related to the choice of
learning strategies. Based on a study of 130 undergraduate business students, Sadler-

28
Smith (1999) found that Analyst learners adopted a deeper learning approach than their
Intuitive peers, while Intuitive learners had a stronger preference for collaborative
learning approaches than did the Analysts. FD individuals are more likely to be
dominated or influenced by the prevailing field, and thus tend to be unsure about their
responses. On the other hand, FI individuals are adept at overcoming the influences of the
field or embedded context, and are able to experience items as separate and discrete from
their backgrounds (Witkin, 1973). As a consequence, some learning strategies are
especially effective for FD learners. When taking notes from a lecture, Rickards and his
colleagues (Rickards, Fajen, Sullivan, & Gillespie, 1997) found that only FD learners, but
not their FI peers, benefited from signaling phrases in their recall performance. The
signaling phrases, which served like tags or headings, helped FD learners impose
structure on the learning material.
Learning style also influence students’ preference of learning material in terms of the
(1) content structure, (2) mode of presentation, and (3) type of content.
(1) Content Structure: Douglas & Riding (1993) found that when 11-year-old
students were presented with a passage for recall, Wholists did best when the title
of the passage was given before the passage was presented, rather than at the end.
Analytic and Wholistic learners showed different preferences on other content
structures, e.g., Analytic learners need a large viewing window and were
influenced by large step size of learning material (Riding & Grimley, 1999).
(2) Mode of presentation: In general, the verbal and pictorial are the two available
modes of presenting learning related information. Providing students with either a

29
verbal or a pictorial version of the same learning information, Riding and
Ashmore (1980) studied different preferences of 11-year-old Verbalizers and
Imagers. It is not surprising that Verbalizers were superior learners with the verbal
mode while Imagers perform better with the pictorial mode. Within the classroom
setting, although purely verbal presentation is often an option, an alternative
purely pictorial version is rarely an option as some words are also required.
However, it is usually possible to present information in both modes. A similar
study involves selections from students of their preferred format of learning
information. When being presented with three different versions of a sheet, which
contained the same information but in different formats, 16-year-old students
were asked to take one p referred version from teacher’s desk. The versions were
(a) unstructured verbal - paragraphs without headings, (b) structured verbal paragraphs, each with a clear heading, and (c) structured pictorial - paragraphs,
with a clear heading and a pictorial icon. Most verbalizers selected the verbal
version and most of the imagers selected the pictorial version. Students are
attracted to materials that suit their own style. Another study, with first or second
year high school students, found that the computer presentation of material in a
text-plus-picture format facilitated learning. Results of the recall test showed that
50% of the imagers used illustrations as part of their answers, which is much
higher than the 12% of the verbalizers (Riding & Douglas, 1993).
(3) Type of Content: With the type of content of learning material, studies associated
with 11- and 12-year-old students showed that Imagers recall highly visually
descriptive text better than acoustically complex and unfamiliar text, whereas the

30
reverse holds true for Verbalizers (Riding & Dyer, 1980; Riding & Calvey, 1981).
Individuals appear to learn best when information can be readily translated into
their preferred verbal-imagery mode of presentation.

Learning style and information retrieval
The cognitive dimension of human behavior has been recognized and widely explored
in information seeking behavior research. Several researchers studied the effects of
cognitive/learning style on users’ reactions to information organization and representation,
search strategy, and search performance (Belk, Papatheocharous, Germanakos, &
Samaras, 2013; Dworman & Rosenbaum, 2004; Ford et al., 2009; Frias-Martinez et al.,
2007; Huang, Joo, & Xie, 2012; Lee et al., 2005; Palmquist & Kim, 2000; Tenopir et al.,
2008; Wang et al., 2000). Different dimensions of cognitive/learning styles are
considered by IR researchers to further understand their relationships with users’ retrieval
behavior.
FD individuals need more guidance to assist them to find out relevant and meaningful
information (Clewley, Chen, & Liu, 2010; Lee et al., 2005). Liu and Reed (1994)
conducted a study and discovered a significant relationship between participants’
cognitive styles and their use of hypermedia systems. The FI subjects explored the
hypermedia system in a nonlinear mode, whereas the FDs navigated in a relatively linear
mode. This result seemed to be supported by other web searching studies (Ford, Wilson,
Foster, Ellis, & Spink, 2002; Frias-Martinez et al., 2007). In web searching, FD

31
individuals were also found to spend more time searching, visited more nodes (Wang et
al., 2000), made more use of search operators (H. Kim, Yun, & Kim, 2004), and
navigated in a passive mode (Palmquist & Kim, 2000).
Analytic individuals engaged in more active, exploratory, and serendipitous behaviors,
including clearer and more focused thinking, greater change in problem perception as
searches progress, greater engagement in differentiating, and more complex phraseoriented expressions in search transitions (Ford, Miller, & Moss, 2005b; Ford et al., 2009;
Frias-Martinez et al., 2007; Wood, Ford, Miller, Sobczyk, & Duffin, 1996). Compared to
Imagers, Verbalisers display the most extensive and distinctive use of linguistic search
transformations (Ford et al., 2009), effective reading of text-based content (FriasMartinez, Chen, & Liu, 2008), and visiting higher proportion of Web pages in a
hierarchical architecture than in a relational structure (Graff, 2005; Liu & Belkin, 2011).

Papaeconomou and his colleagues (Papaeconomou, Zijlema, & Ingwersen, 2008)
conducted an exploratory study to examine the Global/Sequential dimensions of ILS and
found out their influence on Web page relevance assessment and eye-tracking patterns.
Global learners applied depth/scope and Web layout as a major criteria while Sequential
learners depended strongly on link anchor text and the topic of the Web page criteria.
More interestingly, the result also showed different eye-tracking patterns between the two
styles of learners. When interacting with web pages, Sequential learners displayed the
pattern by gazing from left to right and followed the layout of the page. The Global
learners, on the other hand, applied more diffuse modes of gazing at the same page.

32
Researchers reported that it is not possible to create a common hot spot pattern of Global
learners’ gazing on the page.

2.3.2 Impacts of Learning Style on Learning
During past decades, the constructs of learning style have been receiving growing
attention in educational research. Researchers’ major focus is to examine the influence of
the cognitive factors on learning performance (e.g., achievement tests, grade point
average, teachers’ evaluation, and problem solving). Previous research has been
performed at various levels of education, including middle/high school (Zhang, 2008;
Zimmerman & Ringle, 1981) and higher education (Cassidy & Eachus, 2000; Wang &
Chen, 2008; Zhang, 2002). Several researchers investigated students’ performance in
different areas, e.g., business education (Au, 1997; Backhaus & Liff, 2007), computer
science (Johnson & Kane,1992), and medicine (McManus, Richards, Winder, and
Sproston, 1998). These studies show the direct and indirect effects of students’ learning
style on their achievements.
Other studies also investigated how learning styles impact students on their learning
strategy (Sadler-Smith, 1999; Rickards, Fajen, Sullivan, and Gillespie, 1997) and
preference of learning material (Riding & Douglas, 1993; Riding & Grimley, 1999;
Riding and Ashmore, 1980; Riding & Calvey, 1981; Riding & Dyer, 1980). Table 2.2

2.3.3 Impacts of Learning Style on Information Retrieval
Although based on the considerable amount of literature discussed above, there is a
direct relationship between various cognitive factors and information seeking and
searching performance. It is still not clear in what ways these factors influence the users’
behavior; therefore, a closer look at the previous literature need to be taken. After

34
carefully reviewing the related IR user studies, it can be concluded that cognitive factors
have impact on users searching strategies and perceptions, which can be measured
through search time spent, search effort devoted, search strategies utilized, retrieval
performance, intention, perception, and satisfaction.
Search time
Many research studies found that the search time required by users with different
cognitive/learning styles differed significantly. Search time is employed and defined
diversely in different research; the majority of articles measure search time based on
completion of a search task (Gorrell et al., 2009; Hong, 2004; Liu & Belkin, 2011;
Palmquist & Kim, 2000; Tenopir et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2000). In the study conducted
by Palmquist & Kim (2000), the search time is the average period of time spent on
retrieving a piece of information. The search task was performed to find information on
general requirements for applying for graduate study at a southwest university. The
participants were asked to make a bookmark of the Web page containing the target
information once they found it. The calculation was obtained by dividing the total length
of completion time spent by a participant by the number of bookmarks that he/she made
during the search session. Palmquist & Kim concluded that novice field dependent users
needed more time and visited more nodes than their field independent counterparts did.
The second example that demonstrates the relationship between cognitive factors and
search time used automatic recording techniques to obtain the search time (FriasMartinez et al., 2008). Other researchers utilized characteristics based on total search time

35
(Hupfer , Detlor, Toms, & Trifts, 2009), frequency of use (Hupfer et al., 2009), move
speed and pause time (Tenopir et al., 2008).
Search effort
There are many types of search efforts measured in previous research as indicators of
the influence of cognitive factors. The search effort variables that have been investigated
include the number of search terms or queries initiated (Wood, Ford, Miller, Sobczyk, &
Duffin, 1996; Hupfer et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2004), number of URLs or documents
evaluated (Wang et al., 2000; Graff, 2005), number of mouse clicks (Hupfer et al., 2009),
persistence (Nahl, 1996), and number of search operator (Kim et al., 2004). Kim & Allen
(2002) measured a combination of search efforts, including average time spent, average
number of URLs viewed, average number of bookmarks made, and average number of
times a search/navigational tool was used for completing a search task. Kim and his
colleagues (2004) found that the FD group marked up to three times as many of the
following factors as the FI group: the number of repeated search attempts, the number of
search operators, and option-based search style. For keyword-based search style, on the
contrary, the FI group showed more search attempts with changed keywords in their
search queries.
Search strategies
In addition to search efforts, previous research explored other different search
strategies in which different cognitive characteristics were a determining factor. The use
of specific search and navigation features was the most reported strategy (Frias-Martinez

36
et al., 2007; Frias-Martinez et al., 2008; Hupfer et al., 2009; Kim & Allen, 2002; Kim et
al., 2004; Kinley & Tjondronegoro, 2010; Wood et al., 1996). Kim and his colleagues
(2004) conducted an experimental study on web searching strategies of elementary
students of different cognitive styles and analyzed the variation in their searching
strategies. The search strategies are categorized into two different styles: option-based
and keyword-based. The tendency to depend on search options provided by the system to
improve search results is called an option-based style. The tendency to provide variations
in search keywords to increase the search precision/recall ratio rather than depending on
operating features of information search is regarded as a keyword-based style. Results of
the study indicated that the field-independent group showed much more search attempts
by retrials with changed keywords. Beside the specific search feature, other strategies
incorporated in research include linear/non-linear traversed mode (Palmquist & Kim,
2000; Hupfer et al., 2009), proportion of pages visited (Graff, 2005), search
transformation (Ford et al., 2009), preference of presentation format (Liu & Reed, 1994),
webpage relevance assessment criteria and eye-tracking pattern (Papaeconomou et al.,
2008).
Search performance
The performance of information seeking and searching is identified as an indicator to
demonstrate the cognitive influence. For example, Palmquist and Kim reported
AVNODES as the ‘search efficiency’ performance, which was the average number of
nodes visited for retrieving a piece of related information. The calculation was derived by
dividing the total number of nodes visited for completing a search task by the number of

37
bookmarks (relevant website information) made. Other research also reported indicators
such as number of relevant or credible references retrieved (Wood et al., 1996; Kim et al.,
2004; Kim & Allen, 2002), source relevance (Hupfer et al., 2009), and performance score
(Compeau & Higgins, 1995).
Search perception
Previous research also identifies that cognitive factors would affect how people
perceive and feel about the search interactions. Information searching behaviors not only
can be measured by the cognitive levels, such as search strategies and performance, they
can also be measured from attitude or motivational perspectives, including satisfaction
(Wood et al., 1996; Frias-Martinez et al., 2008; Hupfer et al., 2009), perceived ease of
use and usefulness of web content (Liu & Belkin, 2011; Rains, 2008), information
quality/service attitude (Rains, 2008; Hernandez, Jimenez, & Jose Martin, 2009),
perceived search success (Ford et al., 2009; Rains, 2008; Wood et al., 1996), and
intentions to use again in the future (Rains, 2008; Hernandez et al., 2009). In a study
investigating the perception of cognitive style users toward a comparatively text-based
university library catalog system, verbalizers are more satisfied with the ease of use and
functions provided by the system (Frias-Martinez et al., 2008).
Table 2.3 summarizes the search characteristics, specific search features, and related
empirical research studies discussed in this section. Based on the literature, the most
common search characteristics adopted are search frequency, search time, and search
strategy. Therefore, the observation of help-seeking behaviors conducted in this study
was based on these three measurements.

2.4.

Help-seeking Behavior

As stated earlier, this review focuses on considering information seeking and
searching as a learning process. Today, cognitive researchers are more concerned with
various mental activities, such as perception, thinking, knowledge representation, and
memory. These activities are related to human information processing and problem
solving. The cognitive approach proposes learning as changes in knowledge, the internal
representation system of human. In this view, learning is an active, constructive,
metacognitive process (Shuell, 1986). Many educational scholars believe that helpseeking is one of the most important skills in overcoming learning difficulties (Aleven,
Stahl, Schworm, Fischer, & Wallace, 2003; Mercier & Frederiksen, 2008; Nelson-Le
Gall, 1985). Since many educational and psychological theories have carefully examined
how human cognitive influence people perceive, process, and apply information,
perspectives of cognition from educational psychology would be adopted to explore the
concept information seeking and searching in the following section.
Research on help-seeking has a long history and has evolved a sound theory
indicating that help-seeking is an important academic strategy that facilitates learning
(Karabenick, 1998). As stated previously, learning involves the process of bringing about
changes in learners’ knowledge. In order to make such changes, learners can seek help
from a competent person. For example, a younger learner may encounter difficulties
when solving a particular problem alone and thus seeks out teachers or classmates for
help and advice. This behavior represents that learner’s possible adaptive approach is
trying to solve a difficult problem with help instead of just abandoning it. It is generally

40
believed by educators that children who seek help are more goal oriented and more
engaged in the learning process. When confronting difficulties, they are more willing to
put effort into their problems, not just wait there for others to help them or simply give up
(Nelson-Le Gall, 1981).

2.4.1 Help-seeking in Educational Setting
In a teaching and learning setting, help-seeking allows the learner to actively create
an environment that is sufficiently supportive for them to make progress. It is believed
that help-seeking enables individuals to acquire and master increasingly complex skills
and knowledge. Different models of help-seeking, particularly in problem solving and
online learning environments, are provided to illustrate the detailed processes involved in
help-seeking. In addition, influencing factors are also discussed as follows. The models
are: (1) Nelson-Le Gall’s model of help-seeking, (2) Newman’s adaptive help-seeking
model, and (3) other help-seeking models in interactive learning environment.
Nelson-Le Gall’s model of help-seeking
In educational settings, two different types of help-seeking were proposed and
differentiated: executive help-seeking and instrumental help-seeking (Nelson-Le Gall,
Gumerman, & Scott-Jones, 1983). Executive help-seeking involves a learner’s intention
of having someone else solve a problem for the learner. Although it is not surprising for
young learners to ask for executive help-seeking in order to solve a difficult task, it is a
passive approach in problem-solving and may also be harmful to the development of
independent mastery learning. Instrumental help, on the contrary, refers to situations

41
when only a very precise amount of help is requested. Learners only want some hint and
guidance rather than the direct answer for the problem. They may decline help if they can
perform the task or solve the problem by themselves. However, when facing a problem
that is beyond their competence, they would immediately ask for the help they need.
Help-seeking allows the learner to actively create an environment that is sufficiently
supportive to make progress. It is believed that instrumental help-seeking enables
individuals to acquire and master increasingly complex skills and knowledge. The
deliberate use of help-seeking as a problem-solving activity requires a fair amount of
cognitive sophistication. According to a help-seeking model proposed by Nelson-Le Gall
(1985), several major cognitive processes of help-seeking were outlined, including
awareness, decision, identification, employment, and evaluation. First, individuals
become aware that the problem is difficult and that they need help to accomplish the task.
Then the learners contemplate the available resources versus the situations, and they
make the decision to seek help from others. The learners would need to identify and
select a suitable helper who can provide the needed resources. In the next steps, certain
processes for execution of help are thus required. Learners have to use strategies to elicit
help, and their choices of different strategies are normally influenced by their knowledge
and skills in a traditional learning environment. Finally, the learners need to evaluate the
help-seeking event in accordance with the helpfulness of the help used to solve the
problem, the effectiveness of help-seeking strategies, and other peoples’ reactions toward
help-seeking. Based on the evaluation, the learners would decide the next movement,
whether looking for further help or quitting the process.

42
In addition to the major cognitive processes, Nelson-Le Gall also pointed out that a
learner’s knowledge about the problem, task, and strategies plays an overarching role in
the whole help-seeking processes component. It continuously interacts with all the
processes (Nelson-Le Gall et al., 1983; Newman, 1998). The help-seeking model is
depicted in Figure 2.1.

Gall, 1983, p.270)

Newman’s model of help-seeking
Newman (1994) expanded the model by emphasizing motivation-affective dimension
in the help-seeking process. Based on the Nelson-Le Gall model, Newman (1994)
proposed an adaptive help-seeking model and expanded the role of ‘self-system’ in the
help-seeking process. By adding a cognitive dimension, Newman’s model includes
personal thought, beliefs, desires, values, and feelings, which all help construct learners’

43
choices and decisions. This cognitive dimension is depicted as a ‘motivational-affective
filter’ as shown in Figure 2.3.

Figure 2.2 Adaptive Help-seeking Model (Newman, 1994, p.286)

While proceeding in a task, a learner can continue to monitor their comprehension
with several self-questions, such as “Do I understand this?”, “Should I proceed? “, “Why
should I proceed?”, “Whom should I ask?”, and etc. The processes of self-questioning is
called the ‘motivational-affective filter’, which is a system balancing between the

44
confidence tolerance level (CTL) and the self-efficacy level (SEL). The CTL is already
set in the self-system and is related to the intrinsic preference for challenge, natural
tendency of taking risk, and involvement of task. For example, if the learner prefers a
challenge, or is task-involved, or is willing to take risk, his/her CTL is probably low. SEL
is the judgment of one’s capability of reaching the designated levels of performance. The
CTL is compared with SEL, which is dynamic, changing and task specific. If the SEL
exceeds the CTL, the learner would continue to work individually and independently with
increasing effort, new strategies, and some self-aid such as a dictionary, online resources,
or self-questioning. However, if the SEL does not exceed the CTL, the learner might
want to seek help. From the model, the learner is regarded as a very careful and
thoughtful decision maker in the help-seeking learning process. For learners, the helpseeking is a complex process involving many factors and decisions. The motivational
reason that determines whether a learner would choose a help-seeking strategy lies in the
sense of effectiveness. The effectiveness is the evaluation result of benefits (usefulness in
problem solving, mastery learning, and positive feelings such as confidence) and related
cost (time, effort, and negative feelings such as embarrassment, failure, or low selfesteem). Newman’s model advances Nelson-Le Gall’s model in two main aspects. The
first is that Newman’s model strengthens the ‘self-system’ role of a learner, who is selfconstructing learning through means of self-questioning. The second aspect is that
Newman’s model depicts the help-seeking as a constructive decision-making process.
Help-seeking models in interactive learning environment

45
Help-seeking models proposed more recently are focusing on the computer-based
interactive learning environments (ILEs). Two related models, proposed to help students
in their online learning, are introduced in this section (Aleven, McLaren, & Koedinger,
2006; Mercier & Frederiksen, 2008).
Based on the Adaptive Help-seeking Model created by Newman, Aleven and his
colleagues proposed a conceptual model, which illustrates how a learner makes decisions
and applies different help-seeking choices to solve math problems. The model is intended
to be the theoretical framework for a real help system of ILE. In comparison with
traditional learning situations, Aleven and his colleagues concluded that help-seeking in
ILEs basically follows the five help-seeking processes in Nelson-La Gall’s model, but
may also differ in some ways. As far as awareness of the need for help is concerned, they
noted that in traditional learning situations, learners are not assisted in their tasks,
whereas in ILEs, more detailed feedback is directly given to students. The decision to
seek help may also differ across learning situations. In particular, obstacles such as the
fear, worry, and embarrassment of being seen as ‘‘dumb” may not influence an ILE
learner in deciding whether to seek help. However, there are limitations related to the ILE
model. For example, when help systems do not provide task-specific information,
learners have much more work to do in order to find applicable information (Aleven et al.,
2003; Puustinen & Rouet, 2009). Based on the framework of Aleven’s model on ILE,
Mercier & Fredericksen (2008) further proposed a cognitive model of help-seeking
embedded within problem-solving episodes. This model involves four main steps that
constitute a help-seeking episode. In addition to the main steps, there is an emphasis of
‘self-system’ on the aspects of reflecting and monitoring.

46
Differences of help-seeking in classroom and information searching
The research findings based on educational settings provide valuable insights into
what the processes of help-seeking are and how self-system impacts the decision to seek
help. These insights benefit the understanding of help-seeking in information searching.
However, it is worth noting that there are certain differences and limitations. First, the
helper in the traditional classroom is usually a human (e.g., a teacher), while in retrieval
systems, the human helper may be replaced by a built-in support tool, online
communication, or help systems. The related costs to seek help in retrieval systems are
comparatively low. These costs include help-seeking time, effort, and associated negative
feelings, such as embarrassment, worry, failure, or low self-esteem. Secondly, the types
of help-seeking tend to be executive rather than instrumental in information retrieval
environment. Given a search task in mind, individuals are facing immediate urge to solve
the problem at hand. They need to find out ‘the answer’ but not ‘master learning’ in the
searching context. In summary, various models of help-seeking have been illustrated and
several shared similarities and different distinctive features can be observed. First of all,
all models contain the basic help-seeking processes or components as proposed by
Nelson-Le Gal. These components include awareness, decision, identification,
employment, and evaluation. In addition to the above major components, Newman added
the ‘self-system’ into help-seeking and enlarged the impact of motivation and affection.
It is worth noting that the help-seeking processes depicted in the models have a high
resemblance to information seeking and searching processes. Thus, the help-seeking
related factors, such as learners’ self-system can be applied to the situation of how users
seek help in IR settings.

47

2.4.2 Help-seeking in Information Searching
Help-seeking is generally regarded as an important problem-solving skill to achieve
goals in different contexts. Many educational scholars believe that help-seeking is one of
the most important skills in overcoming learning difficulties (Nelson-Le Gall, 1985). In
information-seeking and searching environments, while a user is engaged in the process
of interacting with an IR system, he/she may easily encounter problematic situations and
need some kind of help in that search process either from the system or from a human
(Xie & Cool, 2009). Previous research has demonstrated that the existing help systems in
digital libraries as well as other IR environments cannot fully satisfy users’ needs.
Therefore, while viewing help systems as important, people generally find these systems
to be ineffective in a variety of areas. Thus, they tend to use help mechanisms less
frequently (Cool & Xie, 2004; Fisher, 1999; Ismail, 2010; Mansourian, 2008; Pratt, 1998).
Dworman and Rosenbaum (2004) also pointed out that users do not use the help systems
effectively. They hypothesized that users may not use help for many reasons, including:
(1) inability to notice the existence of help within the application system, (2) aversion to
leave their current task, (3) fear, based on past failed experiences in using help, (4)
refusal to admit they are defeated, and (5) tendency of clicking on anything not called
‘help’, e.g., ‘hint’, ‘tip’, or ‘quick reference’. Other researchers shared the same views
and concluded that the use of help systems was often misleading or incomplete, difficult
to navigate, or did not contain enough examples (Purchase & Worrill, 2002). It may even
increase the level a user’s anxiety (Downs & Jackson, 2001; Grayling, 1998; Pratt, 1998).
Based on the theories of Nelson-Le Gall’s (1981) model of the human help-seeking
process and theories of interactivity, Willis (2006) proposed a help-seeking model in a

48
software application context. According to Willis, help systems provided for current
software applications do not adequately support the natural help seeking behaviors of
human beings. More specifically, the deficiencies of support were identified to be linked
with the evaluation of the help-seeking episode and three interactivity dimensions,
including adaptivity, communications, and creativity. Since the number of many new IR
systems has seem proliferative growth during the past decade, most users are unfamiliar
with them. Novice users, who never use or rarely use IR systems, are in need of help
when being situated in a new and strange searching environment. They are vulnerable in
the beginning stage and need assistance to get through the search process and fulfill their
information needs (Nahl, 1999).
In studying user-system interaction, Xie and Cool (2009, p.477) defined the feature of
help-seeking as follows:
“ Help-seeking is characterized by a person, who is engaged in the process of
information searching with an IR system to achieve his or her tasks/goals, and
finds him- or herself needing some sort of help in that process. In this context,
help refers to assistance or clarification from either an IR system or a human in
the search process when people encounter problems.”
In an information retrieval environment, help-seeking represents a mini information
search process. Therefore, cognitive factors that influence information searching
discussed previously would also affect users’ help-seeking behavior.
As Meadows (2008) stated, “a proper understanding of human information retrieval is
now seen as involving an examination of cognitive factors. For example, Belkin’s
anomalous states of knowledge (ASK) model – which attracted considerable attention –

49
hinged on the point that the actual information needs of potential users are not necessarily
known (Belkin, Oddy, & Brooks, 1982).” He further pointed out that the implication of
such models is that retrieval systems must allow a high level of interactive input from the
information seeker. As Gorrel and his colleagues (2009, p.457) stated “these findings
contribute to the long-term aims of the research to develop a model of the actual and
potential role of cognitive factors in information searching, and identify strategic
cognitive interventions that can be built into an intelligent information retrieval system,
driven by the model, capable of enhancing retrieval effectiveness by compensating for
cognitive and affective weaknesses on the part of the searcher”.
Xie and Cool (2009) pointed out similar remarks and called for the identification of
help-seeking situations and more associated factors. In their proposed help-seeking model,
Xie and Cool identified seven help-seeking situations and their associated factors. The
seven situations are: getting started, identifying collections, browse, creating search
statements, refining searches, monitoring searches, and evaluating results. The associated
factors are users’ personal information infrastructure (knowledge of
domain/system/retrieval, experience, and search style), tasks (complexity, types, and
requirement), system (interface design, search mechanism, and content coverage), and
interaction outcomes. The help-seeking model is presented in Figure 2.3.

50

Figure 2.3 Help-seeking Model (Xie & Cool, 2009, p.490)
Previous research has identified learning styles as an influential factor in information
retrieval. More specifically, the implication is to integrate the factor of learning style into
the help-seeking process and develop a micro-user model, which serves as the theoretical
basis for the development and implementation of more helpful IR systems. The impact of
learning styles on the theoretical framework in learning and problem solving has been
confirmed. It can be applied as an additional dimension to understand users’ help-seeking
in IR environments. For example, the learning style can be added to the personal
information infrastructure in Xie and Cool’s model. The combination of the dimension
not only provides a more diversified facet of users but also relates these user
characteristics to system design and other factors in Xie & Cool’s model. As stated earlier
in the previous section, learning styles may have influence on how users choose search

strategies and preferred system help features in terms of content organization and
presentation format. These relationships can be further explored and interwoven with the
original structure in order to provide a deeper understanding of users’ help-seeking
behavior.
Implications for improving help-seeking situations
According to Chang and his colleagues (Chang, Morales Arroyo, Aung, Lwin, Htike,
& Kravchyna, 2008), novice users normally use online help to seek help when they
encounter problems. Expert users, who use a search engine daily, don’t rely on help
mechanisms and prefer trial and error methods when problems are encountered in IR
environment. In order to meet different users’ needs, help content is recommended to be
organized by users’ proficiency levels, including beginners, intermediate users, and
advanced users. Moreover, different types of help resources need to be offered to
accommodate diverse preferences in learning, e.g., learning styles. According to Hsu
(1993), learning style is related to students’ learning in an intelligent system with
explanation-based help system. Hsu found that FD users were more affected by different
explanation types than FI. FI learners learned better with flexible and justification types
of explanations than they did with rule-based explanations. In addition to the above
proposed model, Xie & Cool (2009) suggested practical design implications to improve
the help-seeking problems encountered by users. Table 2.4 summarizes the help-seeking
situations and design implications. The suggested design implications are mainly
concerned with the formats, content, organization, and types of explicit or implicit help

52
features. With more attention paid to these concerns, any system can accommodate
different cognitive styles and motivational states of general users.
Another study identified users’ help-seeking strategies when users failed to satisfy a
specific information need in the web searching environment (Mansourian, 2008). In his
study, Mansourian defined help-seeking as ‘coping strategies’ and classified them into
active and passive coping approaches. Active strategies, such as revising and helpseeking, require further actions to obtain more satisfactory results. In contrast, passive
strategies involve less action to modify the current situation and mainly accept existing
circumstances. It is usual that searchers would prioritize their help-seeking strategies
according to the importance of the search, their determination to change a failed search,
and the overall contextual requirement. Therefore, more context-sensitive help was
suggested to compensate for problematic situations encountered by users who are more
apt to use passive strategies and less determined.

2.4.3 Impact of Learning Style on Help-seeking
Previous research generally recommends that system designers should take cognitive
factors into account in the development of help features in IR systems. An effective IR
system interface needs to provide great affordance and facilitate correct cognitive
development by presenting appropriate messages/clues and providing context- sensitive
help based on detected user characteristics or behaviors (Wang et al., 2000). However,
the mismatch between individual users’ cognitive styles and most of the help feature
designs led users to problematic situations, such as devoting more time and effort to a
task than is appropriate or failure to complete a task. The example stated earlier in this

54
section demonstrates that novice FD users needed more time and visited more nodes than
their FI counterparts did. This implies that the novice FD users tend to have a greater
chance to encounter disorientating situations and therefore needing to seek help. In order
to help FD users, researchers suggested that interface designers need to consider
providing help features with more orientation devices, such as graphical maps of their
search progress and a visual history of visited nodes (Palmquist & Kim, 2000), an
alphabetical browsing index (Frias-Martinez et al., 2008), or simply by making “help”
screens that provide advice to searchers more accessible (Kim & Allen, 2002). In an
attempt to accommodate different preferences of both FD and FI users, Chen and her
colleagues suggested several guidelines, particularly for the design of web directory
features provided in most search engines (Chen, Dimakopoulos, & Magoulas, 2005). In
their study, 57 students in the department of Information Systems and Computers from a
UK university participated in the experiment. The research team proposed a flexible
interface called “Intelligent Directory”, with a variety of means to find information. They
suggested detailed design implications, including offering successive options, switching
visual cues, using scrolling menus, presenting multiple frames, and providing additional
support using colors or icons.
Other dimensions of learning styles also draw the attention of many researchers to
improve the help-seeking situations. For example, Verbalizers have a more positive
perception, as well as effective search performance, in the design of a text-based library
catalog system than do other cognitive style groups. However, the design of help features
cannot just support Verbalizers and ignore the needs and preferences of other cognitive
styles. Thus, multimedia elements are recommended to be included in system design so

55
that the preferences of Imagers can also be considered (Graff, 2005). Graff also suggested
that there is a need to place certain pieces of help information at particular strategic points
throughout in Web architecture in order to accommodate different hypertext browsing
strategies of Verbalizers and Imagers. Nonetheless, such multimedia or extra mechanisms
may not suit all types of cognitive styles. Furthermore, there is a need to provide
personalization, which can be delivered by providing adaptivity (able to adapt) or
adaptability (capable of being adapted). In an adaptive system, users’ cognitive
preferences can be identified by either monitoring his/her behavior with data mining
techniques or by obtaining this information from external surveys. Once the users’
cognitive preferences can be detected, the design of help features in IR systems can be
automatically changed to match the preferences of each individual without user’s
intervention. According to Liu and Belkin (2011), the detected and observed users’
preferences can be used to provide personalized help in IR systems by re-ranking search
results or reformulating queries, thus helping users complete their tasks more effectively
and efficiently. In system with adaptability, users are allowed to modify the design of an
IR system themselves based on their own preference. Examples like a checkbox-based
form can be supplied for users to identify preferences by entering a checkmark in a
suitable checkbox. The design of help features of any IR system would be changed based
on their choices in the checkbox-based form (Frias-Martinez et al., 2008).

2.5.

Summary

Previous research in IR has shifted from a system-centered approach to a usercentered cognitive approach. A user-centered cognitive approach incorporates users’
knowledge, interests, and preference into system design. Due to the emergence of a usercentered approach toward IR research, more emphasis has been placed on cognition,
including human knowledge, skills, attitude, motivation, and other related factors.
In information seeking and searching environments, while a user is engaged in the
process of interacting with an IR system, he/she may easily encounter problematic
situations and need some kind of help in the search process. Novice users need to learn
how to use new IR environments by interacting with help features to fulfill their
searching need. When viewing help-seeking as a learning activity, learning style is an
influential factor that would lead to different help-seeking behaviors. Learning style
deeply influences how students process information in learning activities, including
learning performance, learning strategy, and learning preferences. Since there were no
studies that considered learning style and help-seeking together, the aim of this study was
exploring the effects of learning style on help-seeking interactions in the information
seeking and searching environment.

CHAPTER THREE

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

3.1 Introduction
In this chapter, several facets of study methodology that were used to investigate the
research problem are included. It begins by describing the research questions followed by
the discussion of adopting mixed method research design considerations, which include
qualitative illustration and quantitative testing. The chapter then looks more specifically
at the selection of digital libraries, types of tasks, sampling strategy, descriptive findings,
and, finally detailed description of the procedures to collect data. Both qualitative and
quantitative methods to analyze data are presented. After presenting the data collection
and analysis procedures, the chapter concludes with the descriptions of methodology used
in the pilot study, validity and reliability of data, and limitation of the study.

3.2 Research Questions
The overall purpose of this study is to understand novice users’ help-seeking
behaviors in online information seeking and searching. In supporting this purpose, the
primary objectives are twofold. The first objective is to identify the types of help features
that novice users with different learning styles use in digital libraries. The second
objective is to further identify the different help-seeking approaches applied by novice
users with different learning styles.
Research questions are listed as follows:

58
RQ 1. What are the types of help features that novice users with different
learning styles use in digital libraries?
RQ 2. Is there a significant difference in novice users’ help feature use based
on their learning styles?
RQ 3. What are the help-seeking approaches that novice users with different
learning styles apply in digital libraries?

The associated research hypotheses are discussed in detail in section 3.7 Data
Analysis.

3.3 Research Design

A user study was designed to address the proposed research questions and associated
hypotheses. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to systematically
collect and analyze the data. The mixed methods design consists of three major
components: qualitative exploration, quantitative verification, and qualitative illustration.
In this design, the qualitative data were first collected and analyzed to explore different
types of help features used by users with different learning styles. After the types of help
features were identified as the fundamental representative help-seeking behavior, the
associated quantitative data were collected, and the relationships between learning styles
and help feature use were tested to see whether or not the results would support the
preliminary findings obtained in the exploratory stage. The first two components of the
design serve as the foundation for the third component of qualitative illustration, which
illustrates more in-depth understanding of help-seeking approaches adopted by users with

59
different learning styles. Results from the three major components were analyzed,
connected, and interpreted to better understand novice users’ help-seeking behaviors.
Figure 3.1 depicts the three components of the research design.

Figure 3.1 Components of the Research Design
The rationale for this approach is that the qualitative data and their subsequent
analysis provide exploratory identification of the research problem. The qualitative data
and their analysis explain and illustrate the results from the analyses. Case (2002)
provided an answer to why researchers apply multiple methods by stating “one way to
conduct research that is both valid and reliable is to be found in the use of multiple
methods and multiple sources of data”. It is so true that many researchers share this point
of view and advocate the use of triangulation (Patton, 2002; Silverman, 2005).

60
Triangulation refers to the use of more than one approach to the investigation of research
questions in order to enhance confidence in the findings. Denzin (1978) has suggested
that four different modes of triangulation can be performed to increase research
integrity— in relation to data sources, analysts, theory/perspective, and methods. These
four modes are: (1) data triangulation: the use of a variety of data sources in a study; (2)
investigator triangulation: the use of several different researchers of evaluators; (3) theory
triangulation: the use of multiple perspectives to interpret a single set of data; and (4)
methodological triangulation: the use of multiple methods to study a single problem. All
these triangulation modes provide strategies for reducing systematic bias and distortion
during data analysis. Since much research is found to use only one research method and
thus may suffer from limitations associated with that specific approach. The application
of combining several research methodologies in one research study provides the ability to
double check the results and to counterbalance the weaknesses. Hence, any bias,
distortion, limitation, or weakness of a method can be compensated for. In addition, the
advantage of facilitation is also stressed. When two or more different research strategies
are used to investigate the same phenomenon, findings from one strategy can be
confirmed by the other. The focus is to carefully look for the degree of convergence
(Denzin & Lincoln, 2005; Denzin, 1978). By mixing methods, researchers are allowed to
address issues more objectively, resulting in richer and more comprehensive findings.
The mixed approach of both qualitative and quantitative can be used in a
complementary fashion to answer different questions. The focus is to carefully look for
the degree of convergence rather than a forced choice between the two approaches
(Denzin & Lincoln, 2005; Denzin, 1978).

61

3.4 Design Considerations

Some design considerations are addressed in this section, including the selection of
digital libraries, types of performing tasks, research permission, consent forms, and
confidentiality.

3.4.1 Selection of Digital Libraries
Two digital libraries (DLs) were selected for this study: University of Wisconsin
Milwaukee Digital Collection (UWMDC) (http://www4.uwm.edu/libraries/digilib/) and
the Library of Congress Digital Collection (LOCDC) (http://loc.gov/ Library/libarchgidital.html). Figure 3.2 and figure 3.3 show screen shots of the two DLs (Retrieved April
29, 2012).

Figure 3.2 Screenshot of University of Wisconsin Milwaukee Digital Collection
(UWMDC)

62

Figure 3.3 Screenshot of Library of Congress Digital Collection (LOCDC)
UWMDC is a digital library aiming to serve the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee
academic community as well as the general public. It provides remote access to 30
digitized collections covering diverse topics, such as global issues and local cultural
heritage. LOCDC is a national level digital library established by Library of Congress. It
provides digitized materials on more than 100 thematic topics ranging from American
government to world culture. LOCDC provides richness and relatedness of accessible
content for general academic users. Since participants of this study are mainly UWM
students, these digital libraries were selected base on the users' potential interest in and
utilization of them.
In addition, the two DLs contain visual, audio, and other multimedia formats of
information in various topics. Most importantly, both DLs facilitate information seeking
of novice users with complete and different types of help features. Figure 3.4 and figure
3.5 illustrate the online help services of UWMDC and LOCDC (Retrieved December 10,
2011). The online help of UWMDC use the exact term ‘help’ to provide help information

63
on the related topics: browsing collections, using advanced search, viewing results,
viewing items, viewing compound objects, and changing preferences. LOCDC also
provide online help with various services but labeled in different terms, for example,
Finding Aids (search by keyword and browse), Bibliographies and Guides, Virtual
Reference Shelf, Ask a Librarian (chat, email, inquiries/comments form, and Frequently
Asked Questions).

3.4.2 Types of Tasks
Three types of search tasks were assigned to participants: looking for known items,
looking for specific information, and looking for items with common characteristics (Xie,
2008). The first type of task - looking for known items - refers to entities that can be
identified by particular information, like an author's name or book title. The second type
of task - looking for specific information - refers to searching for an exact fact or data.
The third type of task - looking for item with common characteristics - refers to searching
for items on the same subject (Xie, 2009). Three different tasks were chosen to represent
the three types of tasks that users generally pursue in digital libraries as well as to fit the
coverage of the two selected DLs.
In this study, the first type of task was using three different approaches to find known
items, including video clips of a Coca Cola advertisement and of Martin Luther King.
The second type of task required participants to search for specific information, e.g. the
names of United States presidents who were assassinated during their presidency. The
third type of task was to find resources related to historical figures, such as a baseball
player or a civil right activist. Table 3.1 shows the detailed tasks for each individual
digital library.
In order to reduce the bias caused by the order of the two digital libraries, half of the
participants searched UWMDC first, and the other half started by searching LOCDC. In
addition, task difficulties were also found to influence users’ search behaviors (Gwizdka,
2008; Gwizdka & Spence, 2006; Liu et al., 2010), so a range of tasks covering easy,
medium, and difficult levels are included in this study. The tasks are designed to have

65
different levels of difficulty based on the task complexity categorization proposed by
Bystrom & Jarvelin (1995). According to Bystrom and Jarvelin, the categorization is
based on the determinability of task outcomes, process, and information requirement.

3.4.3 Institutional Review Board
In compliance with the regulations of the UWM Institutional Review Board (IRB),
the permission for conducting the research was granted (IRB#: 12.353 04/30/2012). The
required IRB forms, including New Study Form and Protocol Summary Form were filed.
The New Study Form provided information about the investigator, the study title, study
duration, type of review requested, sources of funding, and subject population; while the
Protocol Summary Form contained the description of the study and its significance,
methods and procedures, and risks and benefits to participants. This study was accorded
an expedited type, since research data were collected from video recordings of
participants for the research purpose. The informed consent form was also developed.
The purpose of the form was to state that the participants are guaranteed certain rights
and agree to be involved in the study, as well as to acknowledge any risks and benefits in
participating in the study.
The anonymity of participants was protected by numerically coding all returned study
data. The data, including pre and post questionnaires, the electronic files, interview
recordings, and transcripts, were stored with a coded participant identification number to
keep the responses confidential. Only the study code was used in describing and
reporting the results. Coded data were made available only for use in the research
analysis, and the links between the coded data and the identifying information of the
individuals were destroyed after the study is completed.

67

3.5 Participants

3.5.1 Sampling Strategy
The sampling strategy used maximum variation. The aim was that common patterns
would emerge from the experiences of participants of various backgrounds, which were
the particular interests and values of the study. Recruitment was conducted using flyers,
referrals, listservs, etc. within the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee (UWM) campus.
Around 60 novice users were recruited for this study, including undergraduate and
graduate students. Since the study took place in an academic setting, these participants
represented general academic users with different ages, genders, ethnicities, as well as
different disciplines, educational levels, computer skills, and other demographic
characteristics. To better represent the diversified educational backgrounds of UWM
student members, different educational disciplines and levels of participants were
purposely recruited as shown in Table 3.2. There were three major categories of
disciplines : (1) arts and humanities: art & design, communication, dance, English, film,
foreign languages and literature, music, theatre, and other related programs; (2) social
science: curriculum and instruction, economics, geography, journalism, advertising,
political science, psychology, sociology, and other related programs; (3) science and
engineering: biological sciences, chemistry and biochemistry, civil engineering, computer
science, electrical engineering, geosciences, mathematical sciences, physics, and other
related programs.

3.5.2 Inclusion and Exclusion of Participants
Novice users are more likely to encounter problems in searching digital libraries
(Nahl, 1999). In order to understand their help-seeking interactions, only novice users
were selected as subjects. Based on self-reported information on frequency of use, an
individual who never uses or rarely uses digital libraries is defined as a novice user, since
he/she has little experience in using digital libraries. The experience in using digital
libraries was the main inclusion criterion. Any potential participant who had frequent use
of digital libraries was excluded from the study. Other inclusion criteria were: (1)
participants must be adult users aged 18 years or older, (2) they must be native speakers
of English, (3) they must be residents in the Milwaukee area, (4) they must have basic
computer literacy skills, and (5) they must have academic or general interest in digital
libraries. UWM students were recruited by announcing the usability research study on
flyers, referral, and various students’ listservs. The potential participants sent email to one
of the researchers showing their interests in participating in the study. During the initial
contact, researchers asked them several questions to make sure they meet the above

69
criteria through email communication. The decision of inclusion and exclusion of
participants were then made by the researchers.

3.5.3 Descriptive Finding
Basic information of participants is presented using descriptive analysis. The
demographic data are first presented, followed by their searching and help feature
experiences with information systems. Then, the distribution of individual’s preference of
learning styles is determined using the results of the Index of Learning Style
measurement.
Demographics
Table 3.3 reveals the demographics distributions for educational level, educational
discipline, age, gender, native language, and ethnicity. There were a total of sixty UWM
student participants who completed the study with equal number of graduate students
(50%) and under graduate students (50%). As for age distribution, most participants were
between the ages of 18 and 21 (20%) or 22 and 29 (52%). About 20% of participants
were between the ages of 30 and 39, and only 8% reported their age to be between 40 and
59. The percentage of female participants was 57%. There were fifty-six (93%) native
speaker participants and four non-native speaker participants. Despite not being native
speakers of English, they had come to the United States at their early ages and spoke
English fluently and expressed their opinions without any problem, and thus were
included in this study. As for the ethnicity, forty-four were Caucasian (73%), seven were

70
Hispanic (12%), one was African American, one was Asian, one was Native American,
and six were from other ethnicity groups.
To better represent the diverse educational backgrounds, participants from different
educational disciplines were carefully selected for this study, including arts and
humanities (35%), social sciences (33%), science and engineering (32%). Participants
came from 26 different majors. The specific disciplines were Art, English, Film, History,
Linguistic, Music (History and Performance), Museum, Spanish, Global Studies,
Accounting, Economics, Education, Finance/Law, Information Studies, Mass
communication, Political Science, Urban Studies, Civil Engineering, Computer Science,
Environmental Science, Geosciences, Healthcare Informatics, Information Science &
Technology, Kinesiology, Mathematics, and Physics.

Search experience
Although participants recruited for the experiment were novice users to DLs, the
proficiency of participants’ searching skills from their internet-related experience could
affect their ways of thinking when carrying out the test. To confirm that all participants
possess enough internet skills without any individual being significantly superior or

72
inferior to the others, participants were asked to self-rate their expertise level of
information search skills on the Web and to provide information about the frequency of
using different IR systems.
Levels of expertise
The participants were asked to assess their level of expertise with Web searching on a
scale from level 1 “Little knowledge or skills” to level 5 “Expert”. All participants rated
themselves according to the concrete descriptions of the levels of expertise as shown in
table 3.4. The purpose of the descriptions, which provide information like the frequency
of help use, IR systems, and advanced search functions, is to help participants to reflect
and clarify their assessment. For example, the rating of “Little knowledge or skills”
means the participant just started learning how to search information on the Web, lots of
help may be anticipated afterward.
Rating results indicated that all participants possess at least an intermediate level of
search skills and are capable of conducting the search tasks. Of the 60 student participants,
thirty-five (58%) rated themselves as level 3 “Intermediate” level; twenty-five (42%)
rated themselves as level 4 “Advanced”. No participant selected level 1 “Little
knowledge or skills”, 2 “Beginner”, or 5 “Expert”. The mean rating and standard
deviation (SD) are 3.42 and 0.52, respectively. So, most participants were quite confident
about their search skills and anticipated no need or little need of help before carrying out
the test. Table 3.4 shows the distribution of participants’ search skills levels.

Frequency of use
The participants also estimated their frequency of use for the various IR systems,
including Web pages, Web search engines (e.g. Google, Yahoo), Online databases (e.g.
EBSCO, ProQuest), Library catalogs (e.g. Panther Cat), and Digital Libraries (Library of
Congress Digital Collections and UWM Library Digital Collections). Table 3.5
summarizes the frequency of use in the various IR systems. Results show that participants
can be regarded as frequent Web users. The mean scores were 4.73 and 4.87, which
means that most participants used Web pages (85%) and Web search engines (90%) on a
daily basis. As for the frequency in using online databases and library catalogs, the
average numbers are 2.5 and 2.73, respectively, which indicates their occasional use of
the two types of IR systems. For both digital libraries (LOCDC and UWMDC), most

74
participants rarely or never use the systems. Participants who reported their frequency as
‘often use’ or ‘occasionally use’ were double-checked later. All of the usage frequencies
were confirmed during the experiment session that they referred to the use of portal of
UWM and LOC library website instead of the portal of the selected Digital Collections.

In general, the participants recruited in this study had at least moderate experience
with IR systems in terms of searching skills and frequency in using IR systems. Although
they were frequent users of Web pages and Web searching engines, they did not
frequently use library e-resources, in particular the digital libraries. Since participants
came from diverse majors with different educational levels and were randomly recruited
from campus during a six-month period, they are thus qualified to realistically represent
the academic novice users investigated in this study.

3.5.4 Help feature experience
To assess the role that typical help functions playing have played in one’s past
searching experience before engaging in the study, four precise questions were included
in the pre-questionnaire: 1. What do you typically do if you encounter any problems in
using an information searching system?; 2. To what extent are help functions of an
information searching system important?; 3. To what extent do you use help functions of
a searching system?; 4. How do you learn to use a new searching system when you use it
for the first time? Tables 3.6 to 3.9 list the corresponding frequency results answered by
the participants.

It is clearly shown in table 3.6 that most participants seldom directly used the system
Help features provided by the IR systems when they encountered problems. That is,
choice “#3 consult system Help” scored only 17%. Instead of using system Help, table

76
3.6 also shows that the majority of participants chose to use other help-seeking
approaches. More than half of the participants (53%) selected “#2 try a different approach”
as their solution to problems encountered in an IR environment. Due to the limitations of
the questionnaire, no further information was gathered about what different searching
approaches were used. Other options selected by participants included try again (14%),
ask for human help (14%), and use other online system (3%).

When asked about the importance of system help, 47 participants (81%) thought that
help functions can be important in a search system (as shown in table 3.7, #3 - #5).
Among them, 12 participants (21%) believed that Help functions were extremely

77
important. However, although participants regarded Help functions as important, data in
table 3.8 show that they seldom use them. More than half of the participants (63%) either
chose “#2 rarely use” or “#1 never use” to represent their frequency in using help
function. These results are similar to previous research findings (Cool & Xie, 2004;
Fisher, 1999; Ismail, 2010; Mansourian, 2008; Pratt, 1998).

Finally, table 3.9 reveals the choices of actions when the participants were to use a
new search system for the very first time, in which only 10% indicated they would
choose to consult system Help feature functions. Comparing the percentages
corresponding to the use of system help in table 3.6 and table 3.9, it is interesting to note
that about 7% of the participants seemed willing to use system help when they
encountered a problem, even after they became relatively familiar with a search system,
that is to say, while only 10% would use system help to learn a new search system, that
number increases to 17% when the user is more familiar with the system and encounters a
problem. Another interesting finding resulting from comparing with table 3.6 is that the

78
percentage who asks for “#3 human help” increases from 14% to 24 % when they interact
with a new system for the first time. The response of “#1 trial and error” is about the
same at around 65%. One participant responded “#4 other” and specified that using a
search engine would be the approach to help him to learn a new searching system.

3.5.5 Cognitive Measure: Learning Styles
The Index of Learning Styles (ILS) was used to measure participants’ learning styles.
After the experiment, the learning style scores were calculated based on the answers
provided by each participant. Thus, at the time of the experiment, participants did not
know their own ILS scores. According previous literature, learning style are purported to
be relatively stable characteristics with some gradual change or development expected
over a long period of time (Cassidy & Eachus, 2000). However, within the short period of
time during the study, the learning style of participants would not change within the
context of interacting with digital libraries.
For the purpose of qualitative analysis in answering the research questions, RQ1 and
RQ3, only participants with at least moderate preference were carefully selected and
included in the analysis. Felder & Spurlin (2005) pointed out that any researcher
considering ILS as a variable was advised to examine only moderate (5-7) to strong (9-11)
preferences of a particular style in order to find the differences in behavior or attitude.
Based on such recommendations, the cutting criterion value for the first two research
questions was set to ‘5’ to show more distinctive characteristics of each type learning
style. In other words, if the values in the Processing dimension are from +5 to +11, the
preference would be considered as at least moderate to strong Active style and vice versa

79
for the Reflective style. The moderate to strong preference (>5) represents the effects of
primary learning style dimension. While performing quantitative tests for RQ 2, the
cutting value for learning styles is set to 0 instead of 5 because the groups can be more
comparable.
Each participant has a set of four scores in different dimensions. The numbers of
participants in each of the different learning styles are listed in Table 3.10. For the
Processing dimension, 52% are Active learners and 48% are Reflective learners. The
Input dimension shows a greater preference with 82% of students being identified as
Visual learners, and only 18% as Verbal learners. For the Perception dimension, about
40% are Sensing learners, while more than half (60%) are Intuitive learners. Finally, for
the Understating dimension, the proportions of Sequential and Global learners are 53%
and 47%, respectively. For each learning style, participants were categorized into either
“Typical” or “Low” groups for all four dimensions based on their scores on ILS. “Typical”
indicates a score value between 5 and 11 with moderate to strong preferences, while
“Low” corresponds to score value under 5. In most cases, the group of “Typical”
participants is about the same proportion as the “Low” groups in all learning style
dimensions with the discrepancy around 10%. The Input dimension is the only exception,
with 40% more participants belonging to the “Typical” group.

Learning Styles

The distributions of each individual dimension are statistically depicted in figure 3.6
to figure 3.9. The distributions among Processing, Perception, and Understanding are
relatively balanced in which both styles consist of comparable amounts of participants.
Figure 3.10 also shows that the distributions for the Processing dimension and
Understanding dimension are very similar, and they appear to overlap on each other. The
only exception is the Input dimension, which has a pretty skewed distribution toward the
Visual style. However, since the number of Verbal styles still reaches 5, the statistical
testing for the Input dimension was included in the analysis.

3.6 Data Collection

Multiple methods were employed in this study, including pre-questionnaires,
cognitive instruments, think-aloud protocols, transaction logs, and interviews. The
researcher played as a neutral outsider and facilitator in the research process. The context
of the study was designed to be in an academic setting with real academic users and real
academic problems.

3.6.1 Data Collection Methods
Pre-questionnaire
The consent forms and pre-questionnaires were designed to be sent to the potential
participants via email. The consent form (Appendix A) included information explaining
the purpose, procedures, benefits, and risks of the study. The pre-questionnaire

83
(Appendix B) collected information in relation to participants’ demographic
characteristics, their experiences of different IR systems, and experiences and perceptions
in using help mechanism in different systems. Demographic questions provided
information regarding participants’ age, gender, native language, ethnicity/race, and
educational backgrounds. The self-developed pre-questionnaire contained items of
different formats: multiple choices, asking either for one option or all that apply, selfassessment items, measured on the 5-point Likert-type (Likert scaling of 1 = Never use, 5
= Use Daily), and open-ended questions. Some multiple choice questions in the survey
have an open-ended “Other (please specify)” option for participants to provide correct
answers. Please refer to Appendix A and B for individual item questions
Learning style instruments
According to Choemprayong and Wildemuth (2009), employing an instrument that
has been carefully developed to study cognitive factors in user – system interactions is
the most effective way to do so. In this study, an appropriate measure, Index of Learning
Style, was adopted to measure novice users’ cognitive preferences.
The questionnaire of the Index of Learning Style ® (ILS) was used to identify
participants’ cognitive preferences in information processing. The Index of Learning
Styles (ILS) is a forty-four-item forced-choice instrument developed in 1991 (Felder &
Soloman, 1991). The learning style dimensions of ILS were adapted from a model
developed by Dr. Richard M. Felder and Dr. Linda K. Silverman to assess preferences on
the four dimensions, including processing, input, perceiving, and understanding (Felder
& Silverman, 1988). The ILS questionnaire is one of the most popular instruments used

84
to identify people’s learning preferences. While most learning styles measurements
classify learners into few groups, ILS describes learners in more details and dimensions
and to help understand facets of learners’ cognitive processes. Table 3.11 presents a
summary of the learning style dimensions, the associated item numbers, as well as a short
description of learning preferences of each dimension; a copy of the ILS is included in
the appendix so that items can be linked to the item numbers (please refer to Appendix C
for individual item questions).
In addition, ILS has been reported to be a reliable and valid tool, which has
significant measures of the test-retest reliability. The correlation coefficients of the
instrument varied between 0.7 and 0.9 for an interval of four weeks between test
administrations at the 0.01 significant level (Felder & Spurlin, 2005). According to factor
analysis in three different measures, the dimensions of ILS provide orthogonal scales and
validity constructs (Litzinger, Lee, Wise, & Felder, 2007).

85
Each learner’s preferences were measured using ILS resulting in a group of four
different dimension scores. According to Felder & Soloman (1991), an individual learner
has a personal distinctive preference for each of the four dimensions, which is indicated
by values from -11 to +11 with an increment of 2. The values of each dimension were
divided into two groups. Taking the first Processing dimension as an example, the groups
are either Active (zero to +11) or Reflective (-11 to zero) preferences. These learning
styles can be classified as Active/Reflective, Sensory/Intuitive, Visual/Verbal, and
Sequential/Global. Other dimensions were analyzed following the same approach.
According to Graf and her colleagues (2009), if the value of ILS reaches close to +11, it
indicates a strong preference for one end of one particular dimension. On the other hand,
if the value leans toward the other direction to -11, then it indicates a strong preference on
the opposite end of the dimension. In performing quantitative tests, the cutting value for
learning styles is set to 0 because the groups can be more comparable.
Think-aloud protocol and transaction logs
The methods employed to record help-seeking interactions were think-aloud protocols
and transaction logs. The first method recorded perceived interactions subjectively from
participant, while transaction logs recorded the performed interactions in an objective
manner.
Think-aloud protocol is a data-collecting method used to understand human cognitive
processes based on their verbal reports of their thoughts during problem solving (Patton,
2002).While participants engaged in activities, the researcher asked questions and probes
to get the subject to talk about what he/she is thinking during the tasks. The basic strategy

86
of think-aloud protocols involves getting people who are doing something to verbalize
their thoughts and feelings as they do whatever they’re doing (Griffiths, Hartley, &
Wilson, 2002). Think-aloud protocols have often been used in investigation of user
system interaction. According to Nielsen (1993), think-aloud protocol is the most
valuable method to perform usability testing. It helps to identify users’ perceptions of a
computer system, what they interpret about the interface, and what misunderstandings
they may have about the system. The think-aloud protocols have been used to investigate
the search tactics, processes, and strategies of people who are seeking information.
Think-aloud protocols have several advantages, including ease of conducting, obtaining
of participants’ inner perspectives, and recording the sequence of cognitive processes.
Data of think-aloud protocols are relatively easy to collect. Most of the time, participants
do what they would normally do and are able to speak aloud their thinking at the same
time without much training. This method also enables the possibility of investigating the
inner thoughts, feelings, reactions, frustrations, and concerns that the participants
experience during task performance. In addition, the data collected from these protocols
allow one to record the sequential steps of the participants’ cognitive processes over a
given time period, rather than gathering a general overall impression at the end of a
process. Moreover, this method results in richness of the detail in the collected data.
Therefore, the think-aloud protocol is an appropriate design for this study. The purpose of
probing is to elicit the inner cognitive processes illuminating what is going on in a
participant’s mind during the tasks. In this study, participants were asked to tell about
what they perceived from the interactions with digital libraries.

87
Transaction logs are a non-intrusive method to collect data from individuals for the
purpose of understanding online user behavior. It provides researchers with large
quantities of search information which faithfully and accurately recorded users’ searching
behavior. Data collected from transaction logs can be used to investigate the query terms
used by searcher, their frequencies of use, query subjects, database use patterns,
navigation patterns, and information seeking behavior (Goddard, 2007; Sheble &
Wildemuth, 2009; Spink, Wolfram, Jansen, & Saracevic, 2001; Wolfram, 1999).
Transaction logs have been analyzed in previous studies from a variety of sources,
including Web sites, search engines, digital libraries, and library catalogs (Sheble &
Wildemuth, 2009). However, there are certain limitations of the collected data.
Transaction log data do not include users’ underlying situational, cognitive, or affective
elements, such as motivations, intentions, preference, and satisfaction for searching
(Jansen, 2006; Wolfram, Wang, & Zhang, 2009; Xie & Wolfram, 2009). The
recommended way to overcome this limitation is to combine the capture of transaction
logs with other types of data collection methods. In this study, the client side logs were
collected using usability software, MORAE.
Post-interview
Interviews are the most widely used data collection method to access people’s
experiences within the context of research studies. It is a purposeful conversation which
follows a particular organization and plan with the intent of finding out what is going on
in someone else’s mind. Generally, the main purpose of interviewing is to find out things
that we cannot observe directly. It is impossible to observe everything regarding human

88
being behaviors, including feelings, thoughts, and intentions. We cannot observe people’s
behavior that happened at a previous point in time, nor can we observe the meaning that
those events bring to them. We cannot observe how people have organized their
knowledge about the world around them. The assumption of interviewing is that the
perspectives of others are informed and valuable. It is through the means of interviewing
that we can enter into the other people’s perspectives, including how they view the world,
their terminology and judgments, and the complexity of their individual experiences.
Data collected from interviews consist of verbatim quotations with sufficient context to
be interpretable (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Luo & Wildemuth, 2009; Patton, 2002) .
The standardized open-ended interview was adopted for this study. It requires a set of
questions that are carefully worded, and every interviewee is guaranteed to be asked the
same questions in the same manner and order, including the same probes. The specific
wording of each question provides more consistency and comparability in the answers
derived from different respondents. There are several reasons for performing interviews
in standardized approach. The first reason is that the interview can be highly focused and
efficient. Moreover, the analysis of the responses can be facilitated by providing
comparable answers. Finally, any variation caused by different interviewers can be
minimized (Patton, 2002). The drawback and usual criticism of this approach can be
diminished by making minor adjustments. For example, researchers can be given the
freedom to choose certain questions to dig deeper when it is appropriate or when more
explanations is needed from different participants in the experiment context. Appendix D
lists the post-interview questions.

89

3.6.2 Data Collection Procedures
The study first started with recruiting participants. After the initial contact, the
researcher sent out the consent form and pre-questionnaire through emails to the potential
participants. The consent form included information explaining the purpose, procedures,
benefits and risks of the study. The pre-questionnaire collected the background
experiences of participants in regard to using digital libraries. The individual participant
was asked to come to the Intelligence & Architecture Research Lab located in UWM
Northwest Quadrant building B for the experiment. Upon arrival, participants were asked
to answer the ILS questionnaire to assess their learning style. After the ILS questionnaire,
they were instructed to perform searches in digital libraries on generic tasks assigned to
them. In order to reduce bias caused by the sequence of searching the two digital libraries,
participants were assigned different digital libraries to start with. While participants
performed the tasks, they were asked to “think aloud” about what they were doing and
why they were doing things that way during their searches. Participants were observed
during the search process. Their interactions with the systems were recorded by software
called MORAE. The software helped researchers capture not only audio and facial
expressions of participant’s but also their on-screen interactive activities. The client side
log was captured during experiment sessions on the participants’ machine and more
control can be exerted on which data elements were included in the data set. Immediately
after they performed their searches, each participant was interviewed to elaborate on their
perceptions of the digital libraries based on their interactions with the help features. They
were probed to recall and reflect on why they chose certain help features to solve their
search problems and how they felt about the results of these actions.

90

3.7 Data Analysis

The researcher analyzed both qualitative and quantitative data collected from the prequestionnaires, learning style instrument, think-aloud protocols, transaction log, and postinterviews. Table 3.12 outlines the general procedures of the data collection and analysis.
Demographic characteristics were analyzed based on the data collected from the prequestionnaire. First, dimensions of learning styles of participants were identified based on
the calculation of values obtained from ILS. The descriptive data were reported in the
section 3.5.3. Then, different types of help features utilized by novice users with various
learning styles were explored and investigated using open coding of data collected from
different sources. Next, quantitative analysis was performed to identify the effects of
learning style on users’ choice to use the different types of help features. The units of
analysis were the frequency, the time, and the number of types of help features used.
Finally, the different types of help-seeking approaches adopted by novice users with
different learning styles were investigated based on open coding of data collected from
different sources.

3.7.1 Qualitative Analysis
The grounded theory approach (Creswell, 2007) was used in this study to analyze
qualitative data gathered to address all the research questions. Three primary elements in
qualitative analysis suggested by Wolcott (1994) were included in the analysis: (1)
description, (2) analysis, and (3) interpretation.
For description, information gathered were the source data for analysis. Since the
sampling in qualitative analysis is usually done purposefully, the text from data sources
can produce a description, along with expressions from participants reflecting how they
view and perceive the world. By this means, the perspective of the producers of the text
can be better understood (Berg, 2004). In order to explore the help-seeking interactions,
the qualitative data gathered through pre-questionnaires, think-aloud protocols, and postinterviews were transcribed verbatim and aggregated as the source for analysis. Next, the
collected text was analyzed using open coding.
The analysis of qualitative data goes beyond merely counting words. The researcher
extracts objective content from texts to examine meaning, themes, and patterns that may
be evident or latent in a particular text. The central process is applying coding to identify
essential features and the interrelationships among patterns and themes. Coding
represents the “operations by which data are broken down, conceptualized, and put back
together in new ways” (Strauss & Corbin, 1990). The process of coding needs to examine,
compare, conceptualize, and categorize pieces of concepts and then connect the concepts
and categories together in a meaningful way. In this study, the coding scheme was
developed following this approach.

93
In the third interpretation element, the researcher tried to make sense of the context.
The major themes emerged and were selected. For this study, different types of helpseeking interactions adopted by participants were linked and related to different
dimensions of cognitive factors. Section 4.1 and 4.3 will show the coding schemes for the
data analysis. The purpose is to identify relationships between learning styles and helpseeking behaviors and related theories.
Qualitative research techniques were adopted to explore help-seeking behavior. The
qualitative approach reveals the fascinating complexity of human behavior, beliefs, and
preference. It also enables the collection of rich visual, verbal, and contextual data and
brings the meaning and understanding along with it (Crystal & Wildemuth, 2009).
However, the measurement is often criticized by researchers. According to Case (2008),
qualitative method brings a great deal of validity to the research, yet it may raise issues
about the reliability of what is observed and measured for the reason that specific context
and measurements are difficult to replicate. Case also pointed out the self-reporting from
participants can cause problems for reliability, because of the unreliability of human
memory. To ensure the quality of qualitative research, Silverman (2005) pointed out that
researchers should try as much as possible to explain and describe the procedures used to
ensure that the methods are reliable and thus the conclusions are valid. He suggested
adopting techniques like triangulation and member check to improve research validity.
As for strengthening research reliability, field-note convention and inter-coder agreement
are also recommended.

94
On the other hand, Creswell& Plano (2007) argued that the stress of reliability has
limited meaning in qualitative research due to the nature and focus of natural inquiry.
Moreover, Lincoln and Guba (1985) proposed that reliability and validity should be
replaced with new terms that have a better fit with naturalistic epistemology. They
proposed the term “trustworthiness” to represent the quality and evaluation of qualitative
research. Trustworthiness involves establishing credibility, transferability, dependability,
and confirmability. It is by the evaluation of trustworthiness that the research findings can
prove truly valuable, be transferred to another context, and demonstrate consistency and
neutrality. Several operational techniques to establish the quality of research are proposed
by researchers (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Patton, 2002). Among these, the most important
are: triangulation, member checking, prolonged engagement and persistent observation,
peer debriefing, and negative case analysis. To establish credibility, useful techniques
include thick description to facilitate transferability and auditing to establish
dependability and confirmability. To validate the findings and provide credibility of this
study, five primary techniques mentioned previously were adopted in the qualitative
analysis of the study: (1) triangulation: describe how different sources of information are
interwoven; (2) member checking: getting feedback from the participants on the accuracy
of the recorded data; (3) transferability: providing rich and thick description of the
findings; (4) inter-coder reliability: improving the consistency of coding textual data
among two or more coders; and (5) auditing: asking a person outside the project to
conduct a thorough review of the study and report back (Creswell & Miller, 2002;
Creswell, 2003).

95

3.7.2 Quantitative Analysis
Pre-questionnaire items, including age, gender, educational background, experience
with information retrieval, and experience and perception of using help features in IR
systems, were summarized in the text and reported in tabular form. Learning styles of
participants were next identified and described based on the values obtained from the
measurement. In order to obtain participants’ help-seeking interactions, the recorded
video from MORAE was transformed into a readable format and client side transaction
log data were extracted for statistical testing. Statistical analysis was conducted on data
collected from logs and a cognitive instrument to answer the second research question:
RQ 2 Is there a significant difference in novice users’ help feature use based on their
learning styles?
For the second research question and associated hypotheses, the independent variable
is learning styles. The dependent variable in this study is the help-seeking behavior of
using help features, which was be measured by (1) the frequency of using help features,
(2) the time of using help features, and (3) the number of types of help features used by
participants. According to previous literature in section 2.3.3, the three measures,
including the frequency, the time, and the number of types of help feature used, are the
most identified measures for IR behaviors. Thus, these measurements are employed to
represent users’ help-seeking interaction with the two digital libraries. For the
independent variable, the determination of learning style is done using a psychological
instrument, Index of Learning Style (ILS). Based on the results of ILS, each participant
was categorized into four dimensions of learning style: Processing dimension

96
(Active/Reflective), Input dimension (Visual/verbal), Perception dimension
(Sensing/Intuitive), and Understanding dimension (Sequential/Global). Thus multiple
null hypotheses were generated. Since the research interest is to identify the difference
between two means, two independent samples t test was performed to test the null
hypothesis in which the difference between two means is equal to zero.
The detailed hypotheses are listed in table 3.12. The typical help features used by
specific styles of participants were identified in previous analysis. The data collected for
the use of help features were analyzed with the help of Statistical Package for Social
Sciences software (IBM® SPSS® Statistics 19). An alpha level of .05 was used for all
statistical tests in this study.
There are two assumptions associated with related statistical testing methods: (1)
normal distribution, and (2) homogeneity of variance (Kirk, 1995). The former assumes
that the two samples are independently distributed, which can be easily fulfilled by
procedures of random assignment. The latter requires that the variances of the two
populations be equal. When the data were collected, the distribution and variance were
first checked to see whether there were any violations of the assumptions. Some
alternative approaches were considered and performed when the data were not normally
distributed or with unequal variance (Kirk, 1995). For example, if the data distribution is
positively skewed, applying the logarithmic or square root transformation methods helps
the data achieve near normal distribution. When data are negatively skewed, square
normal transformation can be used. Other alternative analysis methods, i.e. nonparametric approaches, can also be applied for data with a small sample size and unusual

97
distribution (Pett, 1997). The approaches include Man-Whiney U test and Kruskal Wallis
test as well as other tests. Although the non-parametric approaches make fewer
assumptions, it is worth noting that they tend to be more conservative.

3.8 Methodology of Pilot Study

A pilot study of 27 participants was first carried out in March 2010 – February 2011
(Huang & Xie, 2011). Based on the results of the pilot study, several issues related to the
selection of DLs and level of difficulty of the tasks as well as the post-test questionnaire
were identified and revised. The issues and related solutions are listed as follows:
(1) Issue of selection of DLs: Two digital libraries were selected for the pilot study.
They were the University of Wisconsin Digital Collection (UWDC) and American
Memory (AM). However, the search function of UWDC has a major drawback: when
participants enter the same keywords to search for information on different Web pages,
e.g. portal and collections, the DL showed inconsistent results. Such inconsistent
situations led participants to experience anxiety and frustration. Thus, the solution is
remove UWDC from the study and replace it with the University of Wisconsin
Milwaukee Digital Collections (UWMDC).
(2) Issue of level of difficulty of the tasks: In the pilot study, some of the assigned
tasks were found to be too easy for the participants. They found the information right
away without experiencing any help-seeking situations, which is not a typical
consequence that novice users would encounter in a natural setting. As a consequence,
major modifications were made accordingly for the tasks. The tasks for which

98
participants could not find the answer right away are expected to provide a chance for
participants to have rich searching experiences for interacting with the digital library.
(3) Issues of data collection: In the pilot study, there was an open-ended post-test
questionnaire designed to collect self-assessment and self-reflection data when
participants finished the assigned tasks. However, due to time limit or lack of interaction,
the written responses did not allow participants to express their inner thoughts freely and
completely. The researcher often needed to verify each answer orally again from
participants. As a result, the questionnaire was replaced with a standardized open-ended
interview to directly assess participants’ help-seeking experiences.

3.9 Validity and Reliability of Data

To validate the findings and provide reliability and credibility, several primary
techniques previously mentioned were adopted in the study:
(1)Triangulation: Several triangulation approaches in relation to data source,
analysts, and methods were performed to make research quality valid and reliable (Case,
2002; Denzin, 1978). Different sources of data were analyzed using both quantitative and
qualitative approaches. Collected data include interviews, questionnaires, think-aloud
protocols, and transaction logs. The focus was to integrate data in a complementary
fashion and weave interpretation into convergence. In addition, different researchers were
involved in the analysis procedures.
(2) Inter-coder reliability: In order to produce objective analysis and minimize bias,
two researchers analyzed the same data and compared the consistency of their findings.

99
For example, two coders independently coded the help-seeking situations and associated
factors on selected cases which were randomly selected from the total number of
participants. The inter-coder reliability was calculated using Holsti’s (1969) reliability
formula:

In the formula, M represents the number of coding decisions which two coders agree
upon, and N1 and N2 refer to the total number of coding decisions by the first and second
coder, respectively (Austin & Pinkleton, 2006). Inter-coder reliability turned out 0.95,
which ensures the coding consistency.
(3) Reliable and valid assessment: Index of Learning Styles (ILS) was used to
measure participants’ learning styles. The instrument was adopted by previous research
and had proven to result in reliable and valid measurements (Felder & Spurlin, 2005;
Cook & Smith, 2006; (Litzinger et al., 2007).
(4) Member checking: Participants will be given an opportunity to verify the
accuracy of the recorded data. They were encouraged to make corrections and offer
additional information.
(5) Auditing: A person outside the research project was asked to conduct a thorough
review of the study and report back (Creswell & Miller, 2002; Creswell, 2003).

100
(6) Transferability: Rich and thick descriptions of the research context, methods, and
data were provided in detail so that results of the findings can be applicable to other
contexts or settings (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Patton, 2002).

3.10 Summary

This chapter summarizes research questions and design considerations, as well as the
methods and processes of data collection and data analysis. Methodology of the pilot
study and validity and reliability of the study are also discussed.
The purpose of this study is to understand novice users’ help-seeking behaviors in
online information seeking and searching. In supporting this purpose, several research
questions are first addressed then followed by the section which depicts the design
settings, including the selection of DLs and types of tasks. The data collection section
describes the detailed plan about the methods and procedures. Multiple data collection
methods were employed in this study, including pre-questionnaires, cognitive instruments,
think-aloud protocols, transaction logs, and interviews. Both quantitative and qualitative
analyses were performed to answer the research questions. Several statistical analysis
methods are to be included: descriptive analysis and independent samples t test. In
addition, open coding was used to analyze the users’ help-seeking interaction and their
relationships with learning style.
A pilot study, first carried out in 2010 was descried. Based on the results of the pilot
study, several issues related with the selection of DLs and level of difficulty of the tasks

101
as well as the post-test questionnaire were identified and revised. Finally, validity and
reliability of data the study are discussed.

CHAPTER FOUR

FINDINGS AND RESULTS

The purpose of the study is to understand novice users’ help-seeking approaches
while they get started with digital libraries and how learning styles lead to these
approaches. This chapter reports the results based on the analysis of both qualitative and
quantitative data collected from sixty participants. This chapter illustrates the major
findings of the study as they centered on the investigation of the three research questions
namely RQ 1, RQ 2, and RQ 3. A brief summary of findings and results is available at
the end of this chapter.

4.1

RQ 1: What are the types of help features that novice users with

different learning styles use in digital libraries?
In order to answer the first research question, the verbal protocols, interview data
were collected to investigate the help-seeking behaviors. ‘Help-seeking’ is defined as the
situation when an individual encounters problems in the process of information seeking
and searching. The help-seeking behaviors are ‘the interactions that an individual may try
to seek, either from an IR system, a human or other references to solve the problems’.
There were 60 participants in this study and it was found that participants adopted a wide
range of help-seeking behaviors to solve their information problems. It is not surprising
to know that when encountering an impasse, participants tried every possible way to
explore and interact with the digital libraries for seeking system assistance. The system
provides a variety of Help Features assisting the interactions between participants and the
two digital libraries.

103
Results of the study find out that participants tended to use specific features out of the
eight types of Help Features identified in the two digital libraries. The types of help
features used by novice users with different learning styles during the interactions with
digital libraries are presented in Table 4.1, including the definitions that were created
during coding. They are grounded in the data and are described more thoroughly from
sections 4.1.1 to 4.1.4.
The Help Features adopted were not universally applicable to every participant. Some
participants adopted certain help features in individualistic ways. While processing
information in digital libraries, Active and Reflective participants respectively selected
Interactive Help features and Reflective Help features. Visual participants applied a
Visual Help features, and Verbal participants adopted Verbal Help features and Exploring
Help features to help them identify their preferred format of information. Intuitive
participants were willing to perceive and accept the assistance from Scaffolding and
Channeling Help features. Sequential participants adopted Sequential Help features to
make sense of the functions provided by digital library.

As we described in section 3.4.1, the help features provided by both digital libraries
are complete and different from each other. When being given the searching tasks,
participants were found to use diverse help features and topics provided by various levels
of collections from both digital libraries, including the general collection, main collection,
special collections as well as their sub-collections.
According to Xie (2007), there are two different types of help features, ‘explicit help
features’ and ‘implicit help feature’. The explicit help feature refers to any features
provided by the two digital libraries that has ‘help’ as part of the function label, e.g. Help
- Browse by Collection, Help - Viewing Results. These help features were selected with
the awareness and intention when the users needed help. The help features and topics
along with different levels of collection that the features belong to are also summarized in
Appendix E & F. Results of this study show that participants didn’t use explicit help
frequently and used implicit help features instead. The implicit help feature refers to any
help feature without ‘help’ as part of the feature name. Examples of implicit help features
like FAQs, Ask a Librarian, auto-complete, About, etc.). Although Xie categorized help
features into two types, she also addressed that they are not mutually exclusive. Some
help features could have multiple properties. For example, if a specific implicit feature,
FAQs, is placed under the ‘Help’ function, it would be then taken as an explicit help.
Explicit help features are provided by both UWMDC and LOCDC in different topics,
including ‘HELP’, ‘Live Help’, how to search, browse, and view. In this study, both
implicit and explicit help features are included in the results for RQ 1.

106
In order to show how many participants with different dimensions of learning styles
actually adopted a specific type of help features, the participants with their assigned
numbers are listed in the tables in the following sections. The information were extracted
by reviewing all the collected data and looking for evidence of using each type of help
features at least once by each participant in the study.

4.1.1. Help features used by users with Active and Reflective styles
Active learners love to learn by doing and demonstrate active ways of processing
information, while Reflective learners tend to process information by reflection and
introspection. The types of Help features used by Active and Reflective participants are
Interactive Help Features and Reflective Help Features respectively. The examples of the
Interactive Help Features and Reflective Help Features and how they were used are
provided in details as follows.
Interactive Help Features
The Interactive Help Feature is defined in this study as any help feature that
encourages more interactive actions. The characteristics of such help pertain to a two-way
communication between the system and the user. It is not like unidirectional expression
of information without any involvement from the participants. Although there are
standard help-seeking approaches to solve information problem, evidence gathered in this
study show that Active participants show strong preference of Interactive Help Features.
‘Ask a librarian’ is an example of Interactive Help. It was designed as different channels
of format intended to allow users to request assistance from librarians. These channels

107
include electronic mail, inquiry form, or Facebook as shown in Table 4.2. After a request
has been sent out, users usually get a written follow-up response at a later time from
librarians. The questions and answers are usually aggregated and shared with other online
users, since they may also learn from the interactions of other users. For example, the
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) provides various questions raised by previous users
and the corresponding answers provided by the digital librarians.
Not only do digital libraries provide asynchronous help, they also have synchronous
text messaging feature ‘Online Chat’ that allow users to interact with librarians in real
time. The advantage of ‘Online Chat’ is that users get the help from information
professionals online without being physically present. In addition to timeliness, ‘Online
Chat’ also provides an interacting platform for users and librarians to exchange their
information and knowledge. If the response provided by ‘Online Chat’ is not adequate for
the initial inquiry, users have the chance to ask again immediately for clarification. The
process is similar to a face-to-face reference interview. Although users prefer ‘Online
Chat’ service, they are not able to consult it at any time. One of the disadvantages of
‘Online Chat’ is that the service is only offered during certain times. For example, the
hours of ‘Online Chat’ are Monday through Friday 14:00-16:00 Eastern Time for
LOCDC and 9:00-17:00 Central Time for UWMDC. Users from different geographical
regions need to be aware of the time differences in order to get in touch with information
professionals of the two digital libraries. Additionally, not all collections of LOCDC offer
Chat service. Only three collections offer the Chat service, i.e. American Memory
Historical Collections Chat, Digital Reference Section: Chat with a Librarian, and
Newspapers/Periodicals Collections Chat.

Active learners provided reasons explaining their behavior about frequent trying out
of Interactive Help features. P2 stated: “Probably I am more interactive type of person. I
just go into it and try it.” P5 stated his preference of Interactive Help by saying:
“If you go to the Library of Congress Digital Collection, ‘Ask a Librarian’ is kind
of handy, so I used it right away…. And I looked over it a few times at that and
gotten great help from it.”
One participant (P49) tried several ways to find the information regarding the
Milwaukee River Dam. He did get a related document but failed to find the specific
information that he wanted. At this point, he was disappointed and asked the researcher
whether he could use ‘Online Chat’ and said:

109
“I don’t understand. I think I will go back to the main digital collection. What I
would do in real life if I have this question is to ask a librarian. I see there is a
‘LIVE HELP’ button on the bottom of UWMDC. Is it allowed? [Researcher: You
can try]. This is what I would do in real life situation. I didn’t find the information
that I was looking for. Plus, I don’t see any other good ways, so my next option is
to ask. I would go to ‘Online Chat’ for help.”
Reflective Help Features
Reflective help are features that would facilitate users to recollect thoughts from
previous searches and deliberate possible uses in the future. ‘Search History’ is a
reflective help that records previous search terms or strategies that users have done as
well as the number of items found for each search. Since during the search processes,
participants may be drowning in series of slightly varied search terms. Taking a look at
the ‘Search History’ would help users evaluate different search strategies, weigh the
selections of search terms, and change the following terms accordingly for the next steps.
The ‘Location Breadcrumb’ is static and shows the path to where the current page is
located. It also provides links to various levels of digital library hierarchy that
participants have visited previously. If a user gets lost in the middle of a sub-sub
collection of one of the digital library, he/she may easily find direction simply by clicking
the breadcrumb to go with the right orientation.
Users may sometimes use some memory strategies to assist themselves in
remembering previous search results, e.g. write a summary note, print out a copy, or

110
download digitized items for future reference and then reread to clear and verify about
the meaning. The reflective help features are summarized in Table 4.3.

Here is an example of when participants start to use Reflective Help. The situation is
that P36 found a document about Lloyd Barbee. He tried to use enlarge tool to take a
closer look at the text-based document. He planned to use the download feature and save
a copy for future reference and said:
“Let’s see what it says. [The texts shown on the page were quite small and
condensed which made P36 looked tired. He decided to save a copy.] Ok. Here’s
what I would do. When I do research like this, I look for things that I think are
somewhat relevant. And if I think they’re somewhat relevant, I save them. I am
going to copy this image and later decide whether to use or not.”
Another reflective participant (P29) talked about the Reflective Help provided by
LOCDC helped him navigate in digital libraries and said:
“Of course I noticed other one, such as the ‘breadcrumb’ type of feature. It has a
lot of the ‘breadcrumbs’ that is what I called them. You see where you are. I have
a little problem getting back to the top level at certain points. For some reason, it

111
just … at certain point, I have to take some time to go back. I have to think about
it. The ‘breadcrumb’ makes the navigation quite …it felt like straight forward…
smoother.”

4.1.2. Help features used by users with Visual and Verbal styles
Visual learners tend to show visual preferences, while Verbal learners are more
comfortable with expression in written forms. Participants showed their preferred format
of help features in this study. Visual participants select Visual Help features. Verbal
participants choose to use both Verbal Help Features and Exploring help Features. The
examples of the three types of Help Features and how they were used by Visual and
Verbal participants are explained next.
Visual Help Features
Help features that facilitate viewing in the information retrieval interaction in digital
libraries are defined as Visual Help Features. Visual Help is designed to help viewing or
inspecting objects. These Visual Help features include different viewing options in
presenting groups of objects like ‘Gallery View’ as well as inspecting individual item, e.g.
‘Item Viewer’ and ‘View Larger”. ‘How to View’ and ‘How to View - Prints and
Photographs’ provide information regarding how to operate viewing functions for
different formats of objects. Examples of the viewing operations include enlarging,
shrinking, and rotating. Another type of Visual Help is to provide guiding content in
visual format. ‘Screenshot’ is usually incorporated in the help content in guiding
participants what they would be prompted in the search process. A more dynamic

112
presentation in guiding participants is to demonstrate search processes from virtual
librarian’s desk top or instructions in Youtube. Table 4.4 lists all the Visual Help features
discussed.

To show the timing when participants may start to use Visual Help, one participant’s
reaction can be used as an illustrative example. While trying to find some biographical
information of Jackie Robinson, P21 first found the collection, ‘Baseball and Jackie
Robinson’ and discover a timeline sub-collection that contains chronological biographical
information. Later, when she decided to find some images of Jackie Robinson, P21
clicked the ‘Gallery View’, which helped her quickly find three pictures, including two
pictures depicting Jackie Robinson in the baseball field and one picture of him and his
family. P21 felt the pictures she found were very nice pictures which made her interested
in the topic of Jackie Robinson.

113
Visual learners talked about how the Visual Help features helped them understand the
content of digital libraries. P2 stated: “I am probably more of a visual learner and [the
Visual Help feature in] UWM has more actual visual documents and it makes easier to
actually see the items.” P40 also explained his frequent use of the Visual Help feature
which helped him activate his sense:
“I like those [Gallery View]. That is the first thing you want to see. And your eyes
are activated what you are looking here. I think that would be a good layout in my
sense… For me, this layout [Gallery View] is better, because it highlights the
images. I can access these images and know what kind of data they present and
that sort of things.”
Verbal Help Features
Help features that are expressed in written or spoken words to facilitate reading and
listening in the interaction are defined as Verbal Help Features. The feature ‘About’ is
one example of Verbal Help feature. It summarizes background information about the
collection mission, history, related projects services, financial support, and awards. The
feature ‘About’ contains several different types of overview data in both digital libraries,
including ‘About this Collection, ‘About the Project’, and ‘About Digital Collections’.
Likewise, LOCDC provides’ About’ for other help features, which help users to
effectively use these features, such as ‘About Finding Aids’ and ‘About Browse by
Topic’. One example of Verbal Help is the short description under each featured
collection and service of LOCDC. The description provides a brief summary explaining
the content and scope covered by the collection (please refer to Figure 4.1). The

114
description of ‘Historic Newspaper’ provides the information that the collection content
is from ‘Chronicling America’ project, while the brief summary of ‘Prints and
Photographs’ informs that there is a large amount of image items contained in the
collection.

The following is an example regarding participants’ initiation of using Verbal Help.
When P59 tried to find out the year that Lincoln was assassinated, she typed in ‘Lincoln
assassination’ in the search box and obtained more than fifteen hundred results. Instead of
clicking any of the items, P59 scanned the first result page for a while and found some
information that was listed under the first item to be useful, ‘Lincoln Paper: Lincoln
Assassinations: Introduction’. She continued to read out the description under the first
item:
“[Abraham Lincoln Papers. The Library of Congress, Stern Collection, Rare
Book and Special Collections Division. On the evening of April 14, 1865, while
attending a special performance of the comedy……..’ Site: LOC gov web pages,
Original format: Web Page.] I got it. It was 1865, April 14. Well, I think I knew it
already. ”

Exploring Help Features
Help features that provide a structure of subject categories of the overall scope or
different topical aspects of the sub-collections are defined as Exploring Help Feature.
‘Browse by’ feature is the major type of Exploring Help that uses descriptive titles to
depict the content coverage in various subject categories (‘Browse by category’, ‘Browse
by topic’), or collection topics (‘Browse by collection’), in the digital libraries. The
structured topics and categories serve as critical reference points for participants to match

116
their knowledge and needs at the very beginning or during their search processes. Table
4.6 lists the Exploring help features of the two digital libraries observed in this study.

After given the first task of finding out a Coca Cola advertising video using LOCDC,
P32 scanned the LOCDC homepage quickly and started to browse ‘Featured Collections

“So I’m looking through the ‘Feature Digital Collections and Services’ to see if
any of them might help. I can scan the page. But my eyes immediately go up here
to the digital collections. I think I would browse through the featured collections
and their headlines. So, it’s like different topics area. [While not finding anything
related, P32 chose to use ‘Browse by Topic’ instead of ‘Search’] I guess I could
use the search function, but… I’m tempted not to do that. I’m tempted to browse
by topic to see if there is any advertising collection… That’s something I would

4.1.3. Help features used by users with Sensing and Intuitive styles
Intuitive learners prefer to perceive information as relationships while Sensing
learners prefer solving problems by standard methods. Intuitive participants are more
comfortable to adopt help features that support their preference. Intuitive participants
welcomed and accepted the contextual assistance from Scaffolding Help Features and
perceived Channeling Help Features as helpful when they find out the relationships
between the results and the search task. Sensing participants, on the other hand, tend to
create search terms without exploring the system. They did not show particular
preference of using any type of help feature.
Scaffolding Help Features
Scaffolding Help Features are features designed to provide relevant assistance based
on the actions taken by users. By default setting, the Scaffolding Help Features are
contextual and responsive, i.e. the appearance of the feature is not triggered to show on
the searching environment, unless a threshold input from users is entered. If the threshold
is met, the system provides the feature automatically. Table 4.7 lists the Scaffolding Help
Features observed in this study.

Usually users might mistype their search term and get ‘Relevance Feedback’
messages from digital libraries. The example messages like: “We were unable to find any
matches for your search” and “Check for spelling errors and typos”. The feature, autocomplete, is one of the examples of Scaffolding Help Features and is especially useful for
such situation when users are not so confident about their selection or spelling of the
search words. Figure 4.2 shows the auto-complete feature provided by LOCDC. It was
happened during the study when one of the participants tried to find out who are the four
presidents that were assassinated during their presidency. When the participant typed in
only the first four characters of the search term, ‘assassination’, the help feature showed a
series of suggested terms, including the intended term ‘assassination’ and other terms
starting with the same four characters, e. g. ‘assam’, ‘assault’, and ‘assassins’. Some
participants perceived the suggestions and accepted it without typing the whole search
terms.

119

Figure 4.2 Auto-complete of LOCDC
While looking for biographical information of Jackie Robinson, P41 did not accept
the suggestions made by auto-complete when she tried to type in several specific search
terms in her mind, e.g. ‘Jackie Robinson biography’, ‘Jackie Robinson’, and ‘Jackie
Robinson story’. She finally noticed the terms suggested by the digital library and said:
“I like that the ‘auto complete’ comes up here. You kind of getting an idea. You
don’t have to type everything. And if I do, I can go to the bottom. [P41 moved the
mouse to select the suggestions made by auto-complete. She chose ‘Jackie
Robinson Baseball’ and got 391 items.] I got the color line. It is amazing that
there are more pictures here. That is what I am looking for.”
The ‘assisted search’ is presented as word clouds once the users select a collection.
Figure 4.3 shows an example of the assisted search of March on Milwaukee Collection in
UWMDC. It is a depiction of the focus of specific subjects presented as a list of subject
terms with different font size and colors. The more frequently a word is searched by other
users, the bigger it gets in size and different colors. This characteristic tool helps
participants quickly catch the main subject of the whole collection by scanning the page.

120
In the given tasks, participants quickly scanned through the page and found the words
‘segregation’, and ‘protest’ to be the largest and most colorful in the word cloud.

Channeling Help Features
Channeling Help Features are system features that provide a system of relevant
categories for a set of retrieved results. This type of feature helps users to narrow or
broaden to other related sources of information based on the results of a previous search
action. Both digital libraries provide Channeling Help Features for participants. The
different categories of the Channeling Help Features include original format, online
format, subject, sites and collections, creator, contributor, location, and language. When
beginning the search in the digital library, the user normally has a rough idea about a
particular historical subject. They may get hundreds or thousands of hits when they enter
the first search term. The Channeling Help Features provides a knowledge matching
place. Participants need not directly retrieve their own knowledge. Instead, by scanning
the different channeling categories, they can easily find out the relationship between their
searching results and their search task and filter the results toward some particular
courses. Table 4.8 lists the Channeling Help features adopted by participants in this study.

P41 searched ‘Jackie Robinson baseball’ from homepage and obtained 391 items. She
looked at the result page and found the Channeling Help. P41 started to click ‘Jackie
Robinson’ from ‘contributor’ and refined the result to two items. She clicked the second
item, ‘Jackie Robinson: a register of his papers in LOC and the related bookmarks’. She
found several refining sections included in the document and said:
“Collection summary, organization of the papers, administrative info,
biographical note, scope and content note, and…. Oh, wait. Oh, BIOGRAPHY.
This might be something. Hum. Let’s see. This could be something here but I am
sure.. Yeah, there is a list of his major achievements here too. I did not know that.
The list here is excellent. If I were doing a report, the biographical note is very
helpful. I want to copy it all here.”

122

4.1.4. Help features used by users with Sequential and Global styles
Sequential and Global learners applied their preferred strategies to make sense of and
understand DLs and their functions. It was observed that Sequential participants adopted
Sequential Help features to solve their problems when interacting with the two digital
libraries. Global participants did not show observable pattern in using particular type of
help features. Since participants were allowed to search for each task within the time limit
of ten minutes, they did not have sufficient time to demonstrate specific behavioral
pattern of using help features in such settings.
Sequential Help Features
Help features that contain sequential order are defined as Sequential help. Sequential
help features facilitate participants’ navigation behaviors by two approaches: browsing in
logical order and utilizing directional navigation guide. ‘Timeline’ and ‘Browse by Date’
are examples of Sequential help features that provide chronological cues when
participants start browsing for historical events. ‘Timeline’ provides several periods of
time and related major events for reference that helps participants to understand the order
of time and trends for a specific subject. Sequential help also provides directional
navigation guidance which could help participants in moving forward, backward, upward,
or downward. Table 4.9 lists the Sequential help features adopted by participants in this
study.

Here is the situation when P30 started to use Sequential Help in LOCDC. While
trying to find who were the four presidents assassinated during their presidency, P30 first
searched ‘assassination years’ and obtained 128 items. Without the intention to go into
each individual item, P30 just scanned the tiles on the first page of result. She did not find
any satisfactory item, so she clicked Next Page and proceed to the second page of results.
Not finding anything relevant, P30 clicked Next Page again and proceed to the third page.

RQ 2: Is there a significant difference in novice users’ help feature

use based on their learning styles?
In the previous sections, results of the exploration analysis for RQ 1 demonstrate that
participants with diversified learning styles show unique qualitative help-seeking
behavior in using Help features. Thus, the major finding of this section focuses on
answering the second research question in regard to whether or not there is a significant
difference in using different types of Help features based on their learning styles. The
analysis for RQ 2 intends to find out quantitative evidence that will support the
preliminary results obtained in the previous exploratory stage in section 4.1. As discussed

124
in 3.6.1, help-seeking behavior was obtained by three measurements: (1) frequency of
using help features (hypotheses H2.1a-H2.4a), (2) time of using help features (hypotheses
H2.1b-H2.4b), and (3) number of types of help feature used by participants (hypotheses
H2.1c-H2.4c). Based on the three different measurements and types of Help Feature
adopted by participants with different learning styles, the associated hypotheses were
specifically generated and rearranged in Table 4.10.

126
Not every help feature emerged from the exploration phase was able to be quantified
into measureable units. Only some of the approaches identified in section 4.1 were
adapted to measure help-seeking behaviors. For the purpose of answering the second
research question, included types of help features are Interactive Help, Visual Help,
Exploring Help, Scaffolding Help, Channeling Help, and Sequential Help. Two types of
help features, Reflective Help and Verbal Help, were not selected for quantitative
analysis due to the very low number of occurrences observed in the analysis. These data
may not provide enough statistical power to analyze the relationship between learning
styles and the use of help features. T-tests were used to analyze the relationship between
learning style dimensions and help-seeking behaviors. Comparisons between the two
groups for each learning style dimensions were made using the three measurements.
Statistical results show that the learning style is associated with the use of help-seeking
features in most dimensions except for the Understanding dimension. Detailed statistical
results for different dimensions of learning styles are described in sections 4.2.1 to 4.2.4.

4.2.1. The Influence of Processing Dimension
The hypotheses H2.1a to H2.1c examine the effects of learning style of Processing
dimension on novice users’ use of Interactive Help Feature. Active participants
demonstrate active ways of processing information using Interactive Help features, thus
the Interactive Help Features were selected for testing the hypothesis to verify the effect
of learning style. As discussed in section 4.1.1, the various Interactive Help features
adopted by the participants include Ask a Librarian, Email, Facebook, FAQs, Inquiry
Form, and Online Chat.

127
Independent-samples t-tests were conducted to compare the three different measures,
frequency, time, and number of types of Interactive Help features used, based on
participants’ learning style in the Processing dimension. Table 4.11 summarizes the
results obtained from t-test analysis.

Results of this study demonstrate that there was a significant difference in the
frequency of using Interactive Help for Active (M = 6.77, SD = 5.33) and Reflective (M
= 0.86, SD = 3.64) style participants, t (58) = 2.83, p = .008. In addition, Active
participants had a higher tendency to choose to use Interactive help. The average number
of types of Interactive help features used by Active participants (M = 2.16, SD = 1.86) is
significantly higher than those adopted by Reflective participants (M = 1.04, SD = 0.92),
t (58) = 2.89, p = .005.
These results reveal that Processing dimension of learning style can impose an effect
on novice users’ help-seeking behaviors. Specifically, when searching in DL
environments, Active participants are more likely to seek help in terms of engaging more
frequently in, spending more time on, and adopting more types of Interactive Help
Features. In other words, novice participants with Active learning style showed higher

128
tendency to seek for Interactive Help, while Reflective participants, on the other hand,
relatively relied on self-exploration.

4.2.2. The Influence of Input Dimension
The hypotheses H2.2a to H2.2c examine the effects of learning style of Input
dimension on novice users’ help-seeking behaviors in three different measures. In the
analysis of RQ1, Visual participants in this study preferred Visual Help features because
the pictorial formats would help them process information quickly and better comprehend
the content in digital libraries. At the verifying stage, Visual participants are expected to
show visual preferences in interacting with Visual Help Features, while Verbal learners
are more comfortable with expression in words, either in oral or written forms.
Independent-samples t-tests were conducted to compare frequency, time, and number
of types of help features used based on participants’ learning style in Input dimension
(Table 4.12). To emphasize the different characteristics of the two styles, Visual and
Verbal, the t-test of the three measurements were carried out in accordance with the two
different approaches, namely Viewing and Exploring Help, respectively. In table 4.12,
results associated with these two approaches are respectively listed as parts a and b.
Results of this study demonstrate that Visual participants are apt to select Visual Help
Features, such as Item Viewer and Gallery View (Table 4.12, part a). There is a
significant difference in the frequency of using Viewing Help between Visual (M = 7.16,
SD = 3.51) and Verbal (M = 3.55, SD = 2.42) participants, t (60) = 3.24, p = .002. It is
also shown that Visual participants spent more time (M = 101.59, SD = 66.46) in using

129
Visual help than their Verbal counterparts (M = 91.45, SD = 77.49), although the
differences did not reach a significant level.

Results of RQ 1 show that Verbal participants tend to choose Exploring Help Feature
as their preferred feature. In addition, they are patient in examining detailed verbal
description Therefore, the Exploring Help was chosen to examine the influence of Input
dimension (hypotheses H2.2a2 to H2.2c2). Verbal participants showed the tendency that
they prefer to comprehend information through browsing textual presentations. This
particular behavior also occurs in information-retrieving contexts where they prefer to
choose Exploring Help Features, including ‘About this Collection’, ‘Featured Collections
& Services’, ‘Browse by Topics’, ‘American History - Browse by Topic’, as well as other
different browsing features (for a complete list of Exploring Help Features, please refer to
Table 4.6).

130
Results of this study reveal that there is a significant difference in the frequency and
time of using Exploring Help between Visual (M =3.73/50.76, SD = 2.19/37.56) and
Verbal (M = 5.9/85.45, SD = 3.64/56.99) participants, t (58) = - 2.52/- 2.50, p = .014/.015
(please refer to Table 4.12). In other words, Verbal participants used Exploring Help
Features significantly more times than Visual participants. In addition to frequency of
using Exploring Help, Verbal participants significantly spent more time in using
Exploring Help Features than Visual counterparts. These results suggest that Input
dimension of learning style does have an effect on novice users’ help-seeking behaviors.
In summary, Verbal and Visual participants showed clear tendency of utilizing help of
their preferred types.

4.2.3. The Influence of Perceiving Dimension
Regarding Perceiving dimension, the relationship between of learning style and the
use of different types of help features were also examined to test hypotheses H2.3a to
H2.3c. The Scaffolding and Channeling Help Features were chosen to verify the
influence of this learning style dimension, in which extracted characteristics were
emerged from the exploratory stage in section 4.1. Sensing participants tend to choose
their standard way of interacting with the digital library help features. Therefore, the
additional assistance provided by Scaffolding Help and Channeling Help from the digital
library systems was used less effectively by the Sensing participants. Intuitive
participants, on the other hand, were willing to perceive and accept the assistance from
Scaffolding and Channeling Help, e.g. ‘Auto-complete’, ‘Relevance Feedback’, and
‘Refining Categories’ when comparing to their Sensing counterparts.

131
The three different measures were used to testify the hypotheses H2.3a1 to H2.3c1 in
order to find out the effect of learning style in Perceiving dimension. Among the three
measurements of Scaffolding Help, only the frequency of using Scaffolding Help shows
significant difference between the Sensing and Intuitive styles of participants. As
indicated in Table 4.13 (part a), the mean frequencies of the two groups of participants
are Sensing (M = 3.54, SD = 4.89) and Intuitive (M = 6.31, SD = 4.22), t(58)= -2.33, p
=.034.

Similarly, the three measurements were adopted to compare the use of Channeling

4.2.4. The Influence of Understanding Dimension
Results of RQ 1 show that Sequential participants preferred Sequential Help.
Therefore, the Sequential Help Features was chosen to examine the influence of
Understanding dimension (hypotheses H2.4a to H2.4c). There is no significant difference
in novice users’ frequency in using help features based on their learning styles in
Understanding dimension (Table 4.14). Comparison of the other two measurements of
Sequential Help features for Sequential and Global participants also revealed no
significant differences between the two groups. Although, results do not reject any of the
three null hypotheses, they show a consistent pattern that the mean score of Sequential
participants are higher than Global participants in three measurements.

4.2.5. Mann-Whitney U Test
Since the parametric statistical testing should meet the assumptions of normal
distribution and homogeneity of variance, the observation regarding the skewed
distributions of the learning style implies that such results might need to be further

133
verified. The Mann-Whitney U test, which is a non-parametric equivalent of t-test, was
next selected to perform additional verification of the quantitative results. The testing
results of Mann-Whitney U test show consistent pattern of results with those of t-test
(Table 4.15 – 4.18).

For the Processing dimension, the null hypotheses of H2.1a (Frequency of Interactive
Help use) and H2.1c (# of types of Interactive Help used) were found to be rejected when

134
using Mann-Whitney U test (please refer to Table 4.15). For the Input dimension, the
testing results also rejected the null hypotheses of H2.2a1 (Frequency of Visual Help use)
and H2.2b2 (Time of Exploring Help use). The testing of hypothesis H2.2a2 (Frequency
of Exploring Help use) did not show ‘significant’ under the non-parametric testing, the pvalue (0.06) is very close to the result of t-test (0.05).

For the Perceiving dimension, only result for the frequency of using Scaffolding Help
(H2.3a1) indicates significant difference between the two groups of participants. The
Mann- Whitney U tests for the rest of the hypotheses did not show significant findings.

In summary, results of the quantitative verification phase demonstrate that the
hypotheses are partially approved and the summary of the testing results are shown in
Table 4.19. Among the four dimensions of learning styles, the first three dimensions
show significant differences, which indicates that the Processing, Input, and Perceiving
dimensions were proven to have influence on participants’ use of different types of help
features. For the Processing dimension, Active participants had a higher tendency to
choose and spent more time to use Interactive Help Features than Reflective participants.
In terms of selecting different input format of help features, results of this study
demonstrate that Visual participants were more inclined to select Visual Help Features,
while Verbal participants showed interesting preference in adopting Exploring Help
Features. Regarding the perceiving of the help features, results indicate that Sensing
participants use the Scaffolding help less effectively than their Intuitive counterparts. No
significant differences were found between Sensing and Intuitive participants in using

136
Channeling Help Features. For Understanding dimension, there is no significant
difference in novice users’ help-seeking behavior between the groups of Sequential and
Global participants

Scaffolding Help Features

As previously stating in section 4.1, the qualitative finding illustrates how learning
styles affect users’ use of help features in information search process. The analysis in this
section intends to find out quantitative evidence that can support the preliminary results
obtained in the previous stage. The connections between the qualitative finding for RQ 1
as well as the quantitative results of RQ 2 are also examined.

137
It should be noted that not all the Help Feature use can be properly converted to
quantitative measurements. Six out of eight Help Features are selected to perform the
quantitative analysis, while the remaining Help Features are not suitable to be represented
with the three variables. The ‘Reflective Help’ and ‘Verbal Help’ cannot be reasonably
quantified by the current experiment setup. Both ‘Reflective Help’ and ‘Verbal Help’ can
only be observed for very low number of occurrences. The corresponding help features
are shown in the last columns of Table 4.19.
Based on the help features analyzed in the quantitative analysis, a comparison
between the results of RQ 1 and RQ 2 reveals three similar patterns. First, the qualitative
finding shows that learning styles affect participants’ use with different help features of
digital libraries. Similar findings can be concluded in the quantitative analysis, in which
the t-tests results reject null hypotheses showing that the effects of learning styles on
users’ help feature interactions are significant.
Secondly, the effects of learning styles on users’ help feature use can be partially
identified in three dimensions, namely Processing (2/3), Input (3/6), and Perceiving (1/6)
dimensions. For Processing dimension, two out of three of the t-tests results reject null
hypotheses of H2.1a and H2.1c. For Input dimension, three (H2.2a1, H2.2a2, and H2.2b2)
out of six of the t-tests results also support the qualitative findings. As for Perceiving
dimension, one (H2.3a1) out of six of the t-test results reject null hypotheses.
Thirdly, t-tests results of the rest of hypotheses (H2.1b, H2.2b1, H2.2c2, H2.3a2,
H2.3b1-2, and H2.3c1-2) testing provide insignificant evidences to support qualitative
findings of the learning style dimensions. However, when comparing the corresponding

138
Mean values, these quantitative results still show consistent tendency in terms of usage
counts. For the analysis of H2.1b, Active participants spend more time in using
Interactive Help than their Reflective counterpart participants, yet the difference does not
reach a significant level. The similar pattern can also be observed in H2.2b1, H2.2c2,
H2.3a2, H2.3b1-2, and H2.3c1-2. However, the t-test testing results for H2.2c1 for Visual
Help indicate no differences between Visual and Verbal participants. The different
groups of participants demonstrate almost the same number of types of Visual Help
Features used. The probable reason might be the low statistical power caused by the
scarce number of types of Visual Help Features observed.
Finally, the testing measurements for the Understanding dimension do not show any
significant results (0/3). The testing measurements for the Understanding
(Sequential/Global) dimension did not indicate significant differences between the two
groups of participants and thus provide no clear supportive evidence. It is not known
exactly what might cause the discrepancy. The possible reasons are the context of
learning may not be transferable for Understanding dimension in the information seeking
environment.
The learning style dimension of Understanding in traditional educational setting
usually takes longer to take place. For example, a unit of subject concept in a classroom
environment might need to take several days or weeks for students to gain the
understanding or learn it. While in the IR environment, users don’t have that much time.
The pace for help-seeking interactions is much shorter, sometimes just taking a couple of
minutes. The influence of Understanding dimension is not easily observed in such a short

139
period of time. Besides, the classification of participants’ learning style is based on the
self-report data of Index of Learning Style. Participants report what they believe their
preferred way of understanding in learning environment. However, while getting started
with digital libraries environment, such preference of learning may not reveal in their
interactions with digital libraries.

4.3

RQ 3: What are the help-seeking approaches that novice users

with different learning styles apply in digital libraries?
The major finding of this study focuses on answering the third research questions in
regard to how learning styles affect their corresponding help-seeking interactions with
digital libraries. According to Felder & Silverman (1988), students learn in many ways.
In traditional educational settings, students learn by actively engaging in activities, or
through reflective introspection. They receive external information by seeing and hearing
and try to reason the perceived information logically and intuitively. Then, they progress
to understand the meaning steadily in fits and starts. Learners bring their unique prior
knowledge, preferences, and beliefs to a learning situation. It is through the learning
cycle that students gradually develop and grow. The Index of Learning Styles classifies
students according to where they fit on a number of dimensions, which refers to the ways
they receive and process information.
In the previous section, representative behaviors of participants regarding their uses
of various types of help features were summarized. During the searching tasks, some
participants with different learning styles were found to use different types of help
features when searching for the given tasks. Some participants obviously adopted certain

140
help features in their particular ways and perhaps more interesting is why they go about
doing so. Section 4.2 also provides quantitative evidence to prove the effects learning
style. To further understand the effects of participants’ learning styles on their helpseeking behaviors, the representative behaviors of participants with different learning
styles were investigated based on various help-seeking approaches observed from typical
novice users of DLs. Results of this study show that participants with different learning
styles exhibit various dimensions of help-seeking interactions while searching
information in digital libraries. When interacting with help features, Active and
Reflective learners in the Processing dimension show different preferred approaches of
engagement. For the Input dimension, Visual and Verbal learners have their preferred
interaction format and content of help features respectively. While engaging in examining
help features, Sensing and Intuitive learners have different preferences in relation to help
content, structure, and design. Sequential and Global learners apply their preferred
strategies to make sense of and understand DLs and their functions. Table 4.20
summarizes participants’ learning styles and the associated categories and types of helpseeking influence.

4.3.1. Processing dimension: Active learners vs. Reflective learners
The most typically observed behavior of Active learners is that they usually take
many actions within a short time as instant reactions without much thinking (Ford et al.
2002; Kim, Yun, and Kim 2004). Active learners like to quickly try things out rather than
tackling long and passive reading. This preference can be reflected by how they interact
and navigate through the online information (Graf, Liu, and Kinshuk 2010). Therefore,

142
while interacting with help features in digital libraries, Active learners interact with
different types of help, choose straightforward help features, and prefer interactive help
features. Reflective learners, on the other hand, use restricted help features and adopt the
features after thoughtful planning.
Trying different types of help features
Active learners tend to work actively with the digital libraries and try as many help
features as possible. According to Ford and his colleagues (2002), Active learners change
their mind relatively readily in information retrieval. They do not speculate on the help
features. While trying help features out, they do not think beforehand nor do they
contemplate about the results provided by the system. As one Active participant stated, “I
just go into it and try it. (P2)” P2 further explained that he was more inclined to keep
actively trying:
“I have to go and try my own instead of going with the instructions, because they
did not help for me. That is how I do it though. I know a lot of people learn by
‘reading out loud’ or just by looking at the instruction. For me, I like to do things
in my own way, like I am tired of sitting there reading or listening to people talk,
it gets pretty tiring especially for college students.”
Many participants replied that ‘actively involving’ is their major way of learning a
new system. P9 explained “Yeah, a couple of things. I learn by doing things. I don’t .. I
don’t …I learn much more by doing.” P17 replied with the similar manner: “I am more
learning by doing, I like to do the activities and that is how I learn.”

143
It is interesting to note that Active learners prefer active engagement in selecting help
features not only mentally but also physically. This specific preference was observed
during the time when P33 answered how she learns to use a new system in the postinterview. With her face expressing great excitement, she mentioned that her particular
way of learning is to actively poke around. Additionally, she also showed passionate
body movements by raising both her hands with fingers pointing in the air like poking for
several times. She replied with enthusiasm: “I learn by just going and poking around. I
know I will never click on a help like. I just poke and poke and poke.”
Since younger generation users grew up with the internet, they don’t think they need
to ‘learn’ it. P35 provided her point of view that she will keep trying new systems and
adjust the differences. The process of justifying the new features is the most effective
way of learning. She said:
“I use computer every day since I was little, so I don’t really have to LEARN a
new system, you know. Just have some differences than what I usually do. It’s
mostly the same and I can justify it quickly. So, in general, I don’t really know,
because I don’t really learn new things. Using it, that would apply a lot.”
Choosing straightforward help features
Active learners seem impatient with long and complicated help features. Instead, they
tend to choose simple, short, and straightforward help features. One Active learner
replied his preference of help feature: “the simpler the better for me at least. (P17)” P35

144
explained how simple features help her know what actions to take along the search
process. She said:
“UWM was really simple. What I need to do is just type in and search which is
really helpful. Just by looking at the basic layout, and then you just continue to
use it and done more searches. It would become a lot easier. This is nice.”
Active learners do not tolerate complicated system design. The interactions with a
difficult system would bring negative feelings about Active learners themselves, which is
detrimental for learning. P5 reflected her inner feeling about a complicated system:
“If it is complicated, I would battle myself, because a lot of these are selfexplanatory and I am a computer illiterate. I can’t figure it out. I don’t want to feel
stupid, and this make me feel stupid. I don’t feel like it helped me learn how to
use it at all.”
P52 also complained about and suggested that both DL systems require more than
baseline skill level and great patience to learn to use them. She preferred to have simple
and straightforward system and stated:
“You have to have some skills to go into and a lot of patience to look for
something. Whereas I feel like, at this time of age, the search engines are
available, you just don’t have time anymore. You just don’t have the patience
anymore, because you have something like Google and Yahoo, which are so
intuitive and simple and it is right away. For these two DL systems, I have to go

145
through so much to find something. The two DL systems should be much simpler,
this is way too much. There is no way to go through.”
In addition to the simple design, P35 also mentioned the Google-like design did not
take as long to search. She raised her voice while comparing about her experience with
both digital libraries and Google. She said:
“Mama! That is difficult. Yeah, when you search in Google you don’t have to
complete like everything. So you don’t have to be specific when you type in
anything and it doesn’t take me as long for searching for something.”
Selecting interactive help
This study shows that Active learners learn best by working actively with the learning
material and applying what they have learned in the real world. They want to be actively
involved in the presentation, including talking, moving, and interacting with the learning
material instead of passively reading, watching, and listening. Active learners not only
explore simple and straightforward functions provided by digital libraries, they also
prefer more Interactive Help features, e.g. ‘Online Chat’ and ‘Ask a Librarian’ to solve
their problems. Interactive help features are required to be easy for users to start
interaction and to act upon. Moreover, interactive features provide real-time, dynamic,
and relevant feedback.
Active learners like to easily start interaction with digital libraries. P17 criticized
UWMDC for not being interactive enough for him at the beginning of his searching and
said “It was kind of hard to see where to start. Obviously, I couldn’t find anything on

146
UWM.” Another participant also expressed that the help features should be easy to reach
from his experience: “If you go to the UWM one, it doesn’t have that one like right on
hand. It does not say anything like ‘Ask a Librarian’ or anything. You have to look for it.
(P5)” In addition, Interactive Help features need to be easy to act upon for Active learners,
because they learn from doing. P16 said “if I have further question, I like the interactive
Chat where I can see how to do it myself.”
For Active learners, perhaps the most attractive characteristic of interactive help is its
responsiveness and effectiveness. Active learners do not learn passively. On the contrary,
they learn by actively involving in the process of communication. When first looked at
the homepage of UWMDC, P2 noticed the FACEBOOK icon and stated: “I like the
FACEBOOK [social media feature provided by UWMDC] and I felt like more
connected.” Moreover, Active learners like to have immediate feedback without a delay
of time in the interaction. One of the Active participants expressed his preference of
online chat over email. He said:
“I think because ‘Live Chat’ is a lot quicker. It is someone instant waiting for you.
Email make you feel like ... I don’t trust that. Because it could take a day or two
to respond and it is too long. For Online Chat, you get the answer immediately.
You just sit there and waiting for them to type. It is nice. So I like to have an
immediate feedback from them. (P16)”
However, just being responsive may not be enough for some of the Active learners.
The negative example for interactive help is the ‘Online Chat’. Compared to
communicating in detail with a librarian or a professor, P17 replied that reading the

147
written texts from ‘Online Chat’ may not be sufficient and effectively enough. He said:
“When I have technical problem, I never go to live help, because it explains something on
the typing. It can’t be as detailed like talking. I would go to librarian or my professors.”
Participants expressed their preference of turning to people in their network of
relationships who they believed would provide the more interaction than ‘Online Chat’.
Since participants are from an academic environment, the help interaction comes from
people in their everyday life – their family members, classmates, professors, and
librarians. P1 reflected her great experience consulting a librarian from UWM library: “I
might ask a librarian, because I have in the past I have used it in UWM and I’ve always
gotten great help from it, so I would try it in the future.” P9 also said “Just being able to
walk through the problem with my professor at the same time is very helpful.”

Limited use of help features
When comparing with Active learners, Reflective learners are more analytic, and
prefer to think about and reflect on the learning material. In other words, they prefer to
process information through self-introspection. They try to retrieve their own knowledge
and experiences and figure out what is best for their learning situation. When
encountering a search problem, Reflective learners show limited use of help features and
select help features after thoughtful planning.
Reflective learners use relatively limited help features. They tend to think over the
usefulness of help features before trying them out and are less willing to take risks.

148
While searching in Digital Library environments, Reflective learners are conservative
in trying out new help features when they encounter problems. Just like P6 said about
his uncertainty in clicking one of the features showing on the page:
“It was a lot more difficult to understand the results that were showing. And I
don’t know…I mean the …., I don’t know what these were... And that’s what I
feel like I can’t click those because it won’t help me”.
Another Reflective participant, P8, also expressed his worry and confusion in trying
one help feature. He has problem connecting to the label of the sub-collections:
“This drop down list of all collection is a little confusing to me. There are so
many archives here. Yeah, if you click up here at the drop down menu, like this
one ‘AGSL Digital Photo Archive: North and Central America’. I don’t know
why this drop down list is kind of intimidating to me.”
P40 offered a reason for his hesitation in trying out help features. When he
processed the information in the DL environment as a novice user, he did not know
what question to ask in the “Ask a Librarian” feature. He said:
“It is not clear where I can start my search based on the browsing categories here.
Oh, ‘Ask a Librarian’. I don’t have to ask questions, because I don’t know what
question to ask at the very beginning. By the time I know which question to ask,
there is no point asking, because they have already been answered. (P40)”
Unlike Active learners, who like to communicate with others, Reflective learners
regard talking as a demanding job. One Reflective participant expressed his feeling about

149
‘Online Chat’ by saying “you know I have trouble talking to somebody live or something
like that. Like that ‘Chat’ thing. I don’t want to try that. (P11)”
Adopting help features after thoughtful planning
Reflective learners prefer to think about and reflect on the learning material. One
Reflective participant replied in the interview that she also likes to try things out but most
of the time she prefers to think beforehand as her way of learning. “Because I am the type
of person who likes to think about it, read and find out. I also like to try and see but more
inclined to think about it first. (P51)” In the study, Reflective participants are more
deliberate, and willing to plan and monitor their search process before they take further
actions. P29 replied how the features helped him monitor search results so that he could
plan for his next search term. He said:
““I definitely have some situations where I am trying different combination of
terms. And I do want “Oh, this is a good search term, and let’s see whether I
could find something related to it.” I can’t remember how good the search result
was. When those features like ‘Search History’ are available, especially you are
going a lot of slight variations of search terms. When I have ‘Search History’, it is
really convenient.””
During the search process, Reflective learners also carefully think about the
navigation plan. They tend to continuously check where they are and think about
strategies of moving around the digital libraries. P18 appreciated one particular wayfinding help feature after she examined the obtained results: “It has a lot of the

150
‘breadcrumbs’. You can see where you are.” Another Reflective participant also reflected
on his top-down strategy of navigation and said: “Once I went into a little deeper, I
remember, OK, this homepage can help me with this, so here, just in case you are the
person who likes to see everything from the top, you can click here. They help you less
confused. (P3)”
Reflective learners are more analytic. They have the tendency to de-structure the
learning process into different parts of aspects of elements where they feel most
comfortable to start thinking and learning. They are not so certain about their learning if
they don’t clearly understand the individual elements which constitute the overall
learning task.
During their search process, Reflective participants expressed their feelings of
uncertainty because of the constant reflections on their behavior. In order to reduce the
uncertainty in the help-seeking process, they appeared to keep asking themselves “Where
should I go? “, “Do I understand the problem?”, “How should I avoid some common
mistakes?” and “Would I remember this?” The questions Reflective participants asked
helped them become alert of where they are and where they are going at the same time.
P40 described how he used the strategy of re-read, maybe re-reading twice or even more
times, to reduce such uncertainty. The strategy of self-help made the ‘current problem’
clear for him before he can start searching. He wanted to make sure where he said “when
I read a problem for the first time, I go back and reread so that I would have in my mind
what I am looking for.”

151
Reflective learners tend to consider every possible situation before they begin
searching. They hope for the best and prepare for the worst. As a novice user, P40
thought about the mistakes that he might make and the resources that would help him
conquer those mistakes. By reading and thinking about the mistakes which others have
been made becomes a driving force for him to start actions. He said:
“And I can correct my mistakes and go along. And there is a list of online
resources, where I can go to just bunch of different places on websites, so there
will be like one of the places, or the online manual. And there will be other places,
where people have private discussion, sort of like forums, web forums. Someone
would say if you are learning this for the first time, this is the sort of mistakes that
beginners are making, and this is how you are going to avoid them that sort of
thing. I just want to have everything on my finger tips so that I can do it myself.”
While conducting a searching on hand, Reflective participants frequently reviewed
the past and prepared for the future. Not only did P40 plan before his searching, he also
thought about it afterward. After searching for a while and obtaining a relevant record, he
tended to write himself a summary note in case he might forget what this was for in the
future. He said:
“It’s a link that I might want to come back to. And we have an image of him, which
is a great place to start. So I will just copy the link. Just write a brief summary of
what this contains. I will write myself a note.”

152

4.3.2. Input dimension: Visual learners vs. Verbal learners
While being presented with different input format of information, learners with
different styles would use preferred verbal or visual strategies to represent their
knowledge and fit their particular way of thinking. People with Visual style prefer visual
aids such as graphics, diagrams, icons, images, videos, demonstrations, conceptual maps,
and color information in the learning contexts (Graf et al. 2007; Hong and Kinshuk 2004).
In a searching environment, Visual learners are more inclined to select visual help
features (Kinley and Tjondronegoro 2010; Wood et al. 1996) and Verbal learners prefer
syntactic and semantic features of help content.
Preferring visual help features
Visual learners in this study preferred visual help features because the pictorial
formats would help them process information in terms of quickly interacting with
information, better memorization, and easy to learn and comprehend. Visual participants
regarded pictorial features as more effective formats during the interactions of identifying,
responding to, and grasping meaning of information. P23 talked about when viewing the
list of long results, the icons helped him feel easier to identify the needed information:
“Personally I am a very visual person, so I like having the icons there. I think the
icons make it easier because you can see exactly what each one is. See what I
have to click through and try to figure out which one is which that way I think the
icons are a lot more helpful.”

153
In addition, imaged cues are more comprehensible for Visual learners. One Visual
learner (P21) said: “I would say that people naturally lean toward to things that are
making more sense to them. So I would think that I am more of a visual one, and I will go
to these images.” When being given the options of different presentation formats, P27
acknowledged that she would go for the images rather than list of texts and said “if you
have to choose one or the other, I would go with the images, instead of the list. Because I
think people would respond a lot better to the images.” She further explained that it is
easier to catch the meaning of images: “I think the images are the most important thing,
and it draws your attention in these things and people grasp images a lot better than grasp
texts.”
As can be expected, while being presented with non-visual format information, Visual
participants tended to feel difficulty, find time consuming, and thus skip a lot of
information. P12 said: “I don’t think it is easy. Not enough visual, I am a visual person.
So I would like to see how the search mechanism happens before I do it.”
Another Visual participant also commented the longer time spent on non-visual
feature: “the list view, um, it takes a while to read comparing to the pictures. I prefer to
have pictures. (P1)” As a result, given the non-visual feature, Visual participants tended
to skip textual information. P30 reflected her feeling about the counter example of nonvisual feature and said:
“Is it for me to judge the relevancy of the subject? What I am looking for is the
picture rather than having scan reading the texts, because I am not a good reader,
so I feel like I would skip over a lot of important things. So the pictures here will

154
help me from not skipping too much and detect more information from the
presentation.”
She also explained that the non-visual feature would be difficult for her and take her
more time to understand: “I might forget and I am pretty good at remembering once I get
to see it. But if I have to read it, then it is more … confusing and time consuming to
comprehend. (P30)”
Selecting syntactic and semantic help content in visual formats
Visual learners show a tendency to notice different levels of the help content in visual
formats, including syntactic and semantic content. Participants with Visual style selected
various syntactic help features (e.g. composition, layout, color, and other visual
arrangement) in their experiences while interacting with both digital libraries. P13
described how clear composition helped her find target information by saying:
“So, having really clear design of the webpage is really helpful, like the way
LOCDC broken up into different spots, you know that helps too. Because I am a
visual person, I can find what I am looking for by glancing. And I think people
are increasingly visual that way.”
The location of the layout also affected their selections in the help content. P41
specifically referred to the left column of the homepage layout of the webpage. Any
information placed on the left column indicates its importance. She said:
“Your eyes naturally go to the left column for clues. Just because I think it is on
that side and it is effective. The left hand column, we read from the left, so, at

155
least in USA. I think putting it on the left is important. I like left hand column. It
is more important than the right hand column. My eyes tend to look at that part of
the page. Part of it is effective because it is consistent. I think that is very
effective.”
Besides the layout and composition, the participants mentioned their preferences on
visual help content on the syntactic structures of color, font size, and density of text. P10
said “the ‘Go to PDF’ of UWMDC just make the words a little bit bigger. I did not even
see this. Oh, here, open a new window and here you have a whole screen. See, it would
be nice if you have this bigger or different color.” Another participant expressed her
preference in text density by saying: “I would say LOCDC looks a little bit clustered,
because there are so much information. I think that would be something useful to
decrease the clutter. Although, I would agree to have the topping over there, you know
just have the brief description maybe a little bit less, and does not look so cluttered. (P5)”
Visual participants also preferred interacting with semantic help content, which refers
to the meaning of the visual help elements. It is interesting to note that P9 immediately
identified the meaning of the image, which is the subject of the Featured Digital
Collections of LOCDC. He also commented about the two different types of objects that
he recognized, including the specific famous people (Jackie Robinson) and the generic
objects (two unknown people):
“Honestly, I am very visual, so when I look at this picture of Jackie Robinson and
all I see in the picture is him, and the rest of it, the catcher and umpire behind the

156
plate, is kind of blurred. For me, I prefer to have more images to explain what is
going on.”
Sometimes the visual elements can be abstract objects, like symbolic icons used for
representing something else. Visual participants also preferred symbolic icons provided
by the gallery view in both digital libraries. P23 commented on the clear icons which
helped her understand the represented formats of documents: “I think you can see what it
is by looking at the result page of UWMDC. Like, this one is an audio file, this one is a
video clip, and this one is a document.” However, not every symbolic icon could
facilitate her searching. By looking at the icons in the result page of LOCDC, it was
difficult for P23 to identify what type of information the iconic refer to. P23 had to click
on every individual link and explored for a while to understand. The visual icons of both
digital libraries compared by P23 are listed in Table 4.21. P23 continued to explain:
“And the other one (LOCDC), the icons are not as precise. Like the ‘legislation
icon’ or the ‘webpage icon’. I found these icons kind of vague. You still kind of
need to figure it out. Like this one, you are supposed to figure this is a webpage,
but I have no idea what this is supposed to be. And this icon is a book? Maybe,
these images are not as clear as those in the other website (UWMDC).”

Preferring verbal help features
Unlike Visual learners, Verbal learners prefer to engage more in verbal help features,
which facilitate their interaction, understanding, and learning in the DLs environment.
They comprehend information through browsing textual presentations, including both
written and spoken explanation. This particular behavior occurs not only in general
learning environments, but also in information-retrieving contexts. One Verbal
participant commented her natural tendency in selecting verbal help at the first glance of
LOCDC:
“When I first looked at the page, the first impression of the homepage, I noticed
that… even there is an image on the page, I would ignore it. I would somehow go
back to the description. I did go to the text, and I didn’t think about that. I mean
potentially or unconsciously. (P32)”
Verbal participants tended to be more oriented to the use of text-based language than
images. She continued to explain how the organization of text directed her in a useful
way: “I did read the text a lot. I also think it is the way the text is written helps me

158
understand what I am looking at. The images felt less important. Yeah, but it is funny, at
here, the text felt really useful.” P39 expressed his dislike of photographs and chose to
interact with written words:
“My primary documents are like novels, poem, or whatever, right. Um, I don’t
normally look at photograph. Typically, I read and respond more to text than I do
to images, because I don’t like different kinds of photographs. So sometimes I
read only the written descriptions.”
Verbal learners learn and comprehend learning material through browsing written
texts or spoken words, which they believe contains the most important information. P11
said, “I remember when I learn by myself or listen to teacher’s lecturing, the most useful
information is words and data.”
Examining semantic verbal description
In the study, Verbal participants presented the tendency of choosing verbal
approaches while performing the searching task. Verbal participants were patient with
and enjoyed evaluating verbal description of help features. They inclined to take longer
time to interact with the semantic characteristics of information in order to grab the
deeper meaning. For example, when presenting several related documents with the same
topics, e.g., pictorial documents or a personal letter, P59 replied with her preference:
“For the research that I have done, I haven’t found a picture being helpful. I can
see how a personal letter being helpful, it would give personal insight to Abraham
Lincoln’s shot.”

159
P46 also talked about her preference of descriptive help of UWMDC because
abstract form feature has details in it which helped her understand the essence of help
content:
“I think the UWM search results have pretty descriptive titles and so it is kind of
a really short version of abstract. This is something that I would look into. So I
think it is pretty helpful. Yeah, it has details in it. So I think that was good…It
would be nice to make it more descriptive to help you find interesting things
better. (P46)”
During the interactions with both digital libraries, Verbal participants selected and
examined semantic verbal help features, moreover, they wanted to construct their own
interpretation from the experience. P39 shared his view of how reading semantic
descriptions is vital in his learning of using a new digital library system:
“But I still feel like the best way about it is like a human being who is familiar
with the material just going through and write a short paragraph or description. So
I was reading the written descriptions.”
He later emphasized reading and interpreting played a critical role in his learning. It
was through continuous interpretation that made him construct his own knowledge. He
said:
“Yes, of course, the way it is presented is incredibly important, because I mean in
my field my subject and my discipline is of course very hermeneutic. Right, we
never take anything as a given. Like this poem is passively conveying meaning to

160
me. For me, interpretation is the ‘key’. And because of my particularly intellectual
commitment, it affects the way I think about interpretation.”

4.3.3. Perceiving dimension: Sensing learners vs. Intuitive learners
While engaging in analyzing help features, Sensing and Intuitive learners had
different preferences in relation to help content, structure, and design. Sensing learners
like concrete information in help materials and prefer solving their problems by standard
methods and dislike surprises. While interacting with help features in digital libraries,
Sensing learners also prefer selecting help content with precise information and adopt
only familiar help features. Intuitive learners, on the other hand, prefer to perceive help
information directly from the internal insights, such as relationships and underlying
principles or theories. In searching in the digital library environment, intuitive learners
have the tendency to analyze the structure and judge design principles of help features.
Selecting help features with concrete information
Sensing learners prefer perceiving help-related information through their senses. They
prefer learning from facts, data, and experimentation in order to relate the learned
material to the real world. One example is that Sensing learners are sensitive to factual
data, such as numbers. Every time when there was a result page showed up, what P48
immediately noticed is the exact number of documents retrieved from the DL system.
During the search process, P48 kept read out or mention the numbers as his preferred way
to perceive information.

161
“I got six hundred and ninety-five articles pop up…. Well, I still got two hundred
and three.... So, only eight things pop up. Four hundred and fifty-four, so a little
more like the other. …I think this one returns like five hundred, and that is more
specific as it only returns maybe like a hundred.”
For the IR environment, based on what Sensing learners gather through their senses,
they can develop a better picture of an IR system. In this study, Sensing participants tried
several functions that contain factual information in the digital libraries. After searching
for a while in one of the digital libraries, P34 wanted to learn more factual information
about Jackie Robinson and said, “But one thing I noticed, now that I’m back on this page,
because it has a map and a timeline. I wonder maybe go back and click on the timeline.”
Moreover, another participant explained that the timeline built up a knowledge base for
his learning: “Looking at the page of Jackie Robinson, first place I go is the ‘Timeline’,
so that gives chronological order in time. The timeline tells you exactly when and what
happened in that period of time. (P26)”
When the factual information, such as date, is not presented in an easy way for
perceiving, Sensing learners tend to have difficulty in the search process. P1 expressed
how she struggled to find the date information in UWMDC. She continued to elaborate
how an automatic presentation of date in LOCDC helped her retrieve knowledge from her
memory:
“For UWM, everything here it is slightly cut out, honestly it is a big deal. I don’t
know. They just seem so broad, and all over and not related to it. Just add the date
and make the date show up. But the other one, the date is automatically. I don’t

162
remember for sure. I don’t know when it was. The date comes up for you and you
will be able to narrow it.”
Avoiding exploring unfamiliar help features
Sensing learners prefer solving problems by standard methods and dislike surprises
(Felder & Silverman, 1988). While interacting with help features in digital libraries,
Sensing learners are more comfortable with their own standard routines in searching
digital libraries and avoid exploring unfamiliar functions. One participant reflected the
consistency in her search habit:
“I think if there is a type of search that I do frequently, I would be able to find the
way to do it and then I will stick with that one way of doing it. So I think that
would be best just pick one way to do it. (P54)”
One Sensing participant commented how familiar design of help features help him
comprehend the functions. P17 talked about his preference on Google-like feature which
would affect how he learned to use the system:
“If there is some type of system, I won’t use anything else other than Google. I
don’t like anything else that looks like Yahoo. I just care how Google looks, and
those kind of things makes sense to me. So you know this one when I see stuff
like the featured categories on this [LOCDC] homepage. This is good to me. This
is something I know how it looks. And that one [UWMDC] does not look good to
me. That affect my ability to comprehend how it works.”

163
Selecting familiar help features built a base for P17 to adjust to the searching
environment, which always gave him positive feeling so as to help him learn to use a new
system. He continued to explain:
“It takes time to really learn to use and adjusting it. You don’t really know what
you are looking at. What is in the system? Is this an article? Is this a book? I don’t
know. [P17 felt lost and confused in the DLs searching environment.] This is how
I struggle in the search process. So, if I had a positive experience and I learned
from it.”
Moreover, searching in a total strange environment makes the Sensing learner felt
confused and not learning anything. P56 remembered how frustrated she was when she
did not see familiar features in UWMDC. She reflected:
“This system did not do a good job on helping me learn how to use this system. I
can’t see anything I am familiar with. I searched, I searched and I searched again,
and I was always confused even after the third tasks. (P56)”
As a result, the decision of providing familiar help features or not would either
facilitate or hamper Sensing learners’ learning progress in DL environment.
Judging the logical design of help features
Intuitive learners are more interested in learning abstract material, such as concepts,
theories, and the underlying meanings. They prefer to perceive the relationships, meaning,
and possibilities through internal intuitive insights, speculation, and unconscious

164
imagination. Instead of perceiving individual objects of the digital libraries, P35 talked
about how intuitive layout design guided her in the search process:
“It was really simple to use. You can either type in a search which is really
helpful or you have the options to browse the different categories, which is nice.
By just looking at the basic layout, and then you just continue to use it and done
more searches. It would become a lot easier. That is nice then.”
Intuitive learners don’t take all the features for granted; on the other hand, they
speculate the relationship between the resulting items and their search terms. According
to P14, he did not get the information of sorting order when he looked at the result page.
He was wondering what were the criteria used to sort the results:
“Yes, the result come back one, two, and three, and I don’t know if the comeback order of importance? It is not in alphabetical order. Is it coming back to my
search word?”
Intuitive participants also liked to analyze specific system functions critically. One
Intuitive participant realized that the search feature limited him to just one category. He
said:
“So I would like to have access to both, rather than just one. I would be very
annoyed if I can only search within the category and I would also be very annoyed.
I had to search the whole library every time I look for something. (P15)”
Intuitive learners adopt a broad-to-narrow approach of interacting with DL. While
being given a certain list of results, Intuitive learners are not satisfied. In order to

165
determine when to start examining individual item, they want to precisely know about
how exhaustiveness and how many types that the whole DL content could be. When
finding their way in the navigation, they want those features that can definitely indicate
what position they are currently in. Just like giving them a map, so they would know the
orientation of major streets before turning into small pathways. P42 revealed a similar
thread of thought by saying:
“I’d like to know the scope of the collection. And you get more of the feel for that
when you look at the DL, they have that .. even right here, the featured collections
and services. It gives you a nice kind of overview of what kind of things that you
might expect to find there.”
After getting the overview, P42 shared her transition to the detailed information of
individual item: “I would go to overview first, and then flip it back to the list view to get
additional information. I would skim through the information before I open it [the
individual item] up.”
P7 also pointed out the importance of overview feature by saying:
“Provide for some kind of overall pictures of how many we have. Then you are
pretty sure this is what I am looking for and this is not. And this item is relevant
for 50 % and that one is relevant for 80%. Those kind of features, you can’t tell
what it is, but you want those kind of help from DL.”
P7 continued to describe her speculation in selecting a collection from a list when she
was not sure of the degree of exhaustiveness of the list. The awareness of such

166
information helped her as a novice user to make the decision whether to continue
searching or not. She said:
“For this one [LOCDC], it said ‘featured’, so I am pretty sure that it is not
exhaustive. But in here [UWMDC], it does not say featured, so I don’t know. It
might be or might be not. I don’t know whether this list is exhaustive or not. I
could guess they give this dropdown menu would lead to everything possible. But
then it seems like an odd list that I don’t know certain things would fit. I wonder
that it is exhaustive. The trouble is I don’t know how extensive either system is so
I don’t know I found everything that I could possibly found there. So I never
know that my search is done or when I should continue.”
Examining the structures of help features
Intuitive learners tend to analyze the desired structure of help features. P59 mentioned
that bad structure of help feature confused her during the search process: “These
individual collections the way that they organize it, I find it to be not... not the best, and it
can be confusing sometime. Because they just give you the long list and it is hard to
browse I think.” Another participant expressed her dislike of the rigid organization of
help feature: “because I feel like I had more options in LOCDC so I can search and
explore through. But this one seems very structured and rigid.” (S30)
P38 criticized the linearly structural design of help feature that did not allow her to
channel to information in different collections. She expressed her disappointment: “When
you are in a particular collection, you can’t immediately go into another collection. You

167
have to go to the top level. Or maybe, for some reason, I am going back and forth
between two collections, the results page or like the general browsing.” She explained
how the linear structure should be changed to integrate other collateral sub-collections:
“For instances, this Africa, instead of clicking ‘digital collections’ at the top level,
then we can select from the list. It might be nice that all of the links of ‘browse
collection list’ are incorporated into the left hand side or perhaps the dropdown
menu was incorporate into one of each page, like Africa, Asia, or Europe. I can
just click on the collections. That would be like kind of convenient.”

4.3.4. Understanding dimension: Sequential learners vs. Global learners
Sequential and Global learners applied their preferred strategies to make sense of and
understand DLs and their functions. Sequential learners understand help features in a
sequential way, while Global learners experience different help features in order to make
sense.
Understanding help content in a sequential way
Sequential learners tend to gradually gain understanding in a linearly incremental way.
When solving problems, they follow linear reasoning processes and prefer logically
ordered learning materials (Felder & Silverman, 1988; Lee et al., 2005). Results of this
study show that Sequential learners understand help content in a sequential way. They
prefer sequential help, navigate in linear way, and select sequential organization of help
content.

168
Three Sequential participants stated their preference of step-by-step help content.
P48 said, “They give a step-by-step instruction to help. I think it’s really helpful.” P50
echoed in similar expression: “But I also like to have steps to follow. So someone gives
me directions to do the steps I will do it.” According to P10, a step-by-step instruction
suited her need and had fastened her learning progress. She said:
“I like those. It is quicker than asking for someone for help. If I can learn from
those and fix the problem by myself, I would choose to do so. It is so quick,
because you can see what they do and just copy exactly what they do and that is
how I learn fast.”
Sequential learners also tend to navigate through the learning materials in a linear and
logical way to make sure their pace of learning. One example of such navigation is that
they like to click on the NEXT or the BACK buttons in the search process. Participant 19
selected those directional buttons to navigate the contents and said: “Once you are done
with that, you can click back [OC: the Back button provided by the browser] and back
and go back to where you were staying.”
Sequential participants preferred to understand help content with sequential
organization. For example, P36 talked about how numerical ordered organization of the
refining feature would help his navigation. In addition to the numbers, he preferred to add
‘indent space’ and ‘line with arrow at one end’ to show the sequence of order. He said:
“Maybe like this LOCDC refining, I think that would help navigate and maybe
put something more. I suppose that is what it is but I don’t know it applies or not.

169
And I guess down here, I can see 7 and these headings underneath can be marked
as 7-1 and 7-2 and so forth. And after that, put lines, put it over like indent and
that is my ideas. Put 7-1 and then 7-2 and then information after that. [P36 drew a
graph when he explains the sequential help feature as shown in Figure 4.4] So I
think maybe putting these little lines and these spaces, I can tell that they are
different pages with that.”

Figure 4.4 A sequential organization of help feature hand drawn by P36
However, if information is presented without sequential order, they tend to be
confused in the learning environment. P36 continued to talk about his confusion: “I
would say this digital library is a little bit confusing about what this is exactly used for.”
Later, he also suggested using flowchart as a tool to organize the sequence of help
content:
“Perhaps maybe if it looks like some kind of flowchart, instead of just the headings.
I think maybe changing the style into the layout of a flowchart and make pretty like
page one, page two, or page three. Yeah, cause as I said this is confusing. It’s like
use a computer and you have like a folder and opening up and like a flowchart

170
things. I will describe it like computer program maybe. This is my suggestions. I
have seen this in computer programs. This is just my ideas.”
Interacting with different help features in order to make sense
Global learners are inclined to learn help materials in a large leap instead of a linear
way. At first, they don’t see connections among the learning materials. After they have
learned enough about and gotten the point of it. They then impose their own structures on
unstructured fields. They prefer global context and relevance to step-by-step progression.
In this study, Global participants demonstrated unique ways in understanding help
content in digital libraries. They interacted with different help features in order to make
sense. P9 reflected that he did not need given instructions beforehand when learning. On
the other hand, firsthand experiences with failure trials would help him to get the gist of it.
He said:
“Right, that is how I like to learn things a lot by just messing around. I don’t
know. I am a guy that does not like to ask for directions. It is like failed twenty
times and then figure out rather than know how to do it and then do it right. That
is the way I learn and click my head. I would prefer [failed] trials over like a book
of telling me what to do.”
As an example of demonstrating ‘making sense’, the interaction of P58 is shown in
the following. In finding out information about Jackie Robinson, P58 tried different types
of help in order to make sense. He went through navigating, help-seeking, and making
sense phases.

171
In the navigating phase, P58 tried several browsing and searching functions in order
to find an image of Jackie Robinson. He tried ‘Browse by subject’, ‘Searching within one
specific collection’, and ‘Teacher resources’. He also tried ‘Advanced Site Search’ and
said: “Let’s see if we can do the advanced search. No, it does not let me search by the
media. It’s very text-focused.” He wanted to see the search bar on every page. However,
the design of the LOCDC webpage did not provided such consistency. He felt confused
during search process and complained, “Cause sometimes like it is not continuous, and
you are not really using the same websites. Like when you searching on Google,
nowadays, the search bar never goes away. It stays there and you feel like you are using
this, but you know.” Without finding any satisfactory results, he realized that he
encountered problems and decided to seek help from DL.
In help-seeking phase, P58 looked at the information on ‘Site Search Help’. He tried
typical tips such as ‘Capitalize proper nouns’ and ‘Use a plus sign to require and a minus
sign to exclude’ but failed to find new results. He felt disappointed and confused. He said:
“Maybe it just depends on the search engine inside the site. I was getting the results,
basically the same results. It didn’t help me with my task. I am always confused with
library websites because there are so much content. They kind of have the same approach.
They have a page where you navigate to learn how to use it and you can use it.”
In the making sense phase, he gave up the use of Search Help provided by LOCDC
and reflected that the browsing features are making more sense to him by saying:
“When I am learning, because I like to try things out and then I get really
interested in it. I mean it is a system and you need to know where or how to use it.

172
Like each of the ‘browsing category’, it got a title and put a lot of time to organize
it, and it is well structured. Sometimes the search and you can get to happen when
I am trying to find.”

4.4

Summary
This chapter presents the major research findings in view of the three research

questions raised in this study. The findings reported for RQ 1 present a comprehensive
picture of the types of help features that participants used in both DLs observed for the
study. Results of the qualitative analysis for RQ 1 show major types of Help Features
adopted by participants. The findings from RQ1 serve as a base for answering RQ 2,
which aim at verifying how learning styles affect users’ interactions with help features.
Statistical tests for RQ 2 reveal quantitative evidence to support the relationships between
learning styles and the use of Help Features. In order to understand the overall picture of
help-seeking interactions, various help-seeking approaches applied by participants with
different learning styles are further identified. The broad triangulation approach assumed
in this study not only explores and confirms the relationships between different learning
styles and Help Features use, but also enables the illustration of novice users’ diversified
help-seeking approaches.

CHAPTER FIVE DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
5.1

Introduction
The objectives of the current study are to identify novice users’ help-seeking

approaches while they get started with digital libraries and how the learning styles lead to
these approaches. In this chapter, the findings from this study are discussed in terms of
their theoretical, practical, and methodological significances, including the potential
contributions to the current literature,. Finally, the limitation of the study, and suggests
areas for further research are also addressed.

5.2

Theoretical Implications
The most profound contribution of the present study to the body of literature related

to information seeking is the understanding of novice users’ help-seeking behaviors in
digital library environment. In order to illustrate a picture of help-seeking behaviors, the
test results were obtained from 60 academic users. The purpose of the research questions
is to uncover the thoughts, feelings and actions of novice users as they search for
information. The studied themes include the exhibition of diversified use of help features,
as well as users’ help-seeking approaches when they encounter various problematic
situations in digital library environments.

5.2.1. Types of Help Features
The help-seeking behaviors are defined as ‘the interactions that an individual may try
to seek, either from an IR system, a human or other references to solve the problems’.

174
When interacting with digital libraries, the best possible situation for users is that they
don’t encounter any problem during searching. Under such situation, users don’t need
help owing to well-designed system with good, intuitive, context-sensitive, and easy to
use functionality. However, most of the time users encounter an impasse, therefore, users
may try to explore and interact with the digital libraries for seeking system assistance
based on their personal style and preference. The help features are adopted by users with
various learning styles in individualistic ways.
In this study, the help systems of the two digital libraries provide a variety of help
features assisting the interactions between participants and the digital libraries. Since the
help system is designed to serve various types of users, each individual may have his/her
own preference in choosing certain help features. The eight types of help features are
identified to be used by users with different learning styles: (1) Processing dimension:
Interactive Help Features and Reflective Help Features; (2) Input dimension: Visual Help
Features, Verbal Help Features, Exploring Help Features; (3) Perceiving dimension:
Scaffolding Help and Channeling Help Features; (4) Understanding dimension:
Sequential Help Features. Previous research identified different types of help features in
digital libraries (Xie, 2007; Xie & Bowser, 2009). In addition to the types of help features,
results of this study further identify users in various learning styles utilize their preferred
types of help features to solve problems during the interaction with IR environment.
To support the exploratory results concluded from section 4.1, quantitative analysis
using

t-test was carried out to verify the influence of learning style on help-seeking

behavior. The help-seeking behavior was evaluated by three measurements, “Frequency”

175
of using help features, “Time” of using help features, and “Number of Types of help
feature” used by participants. Based on these three different measurements and Learning
Styles, associated hypotheses were generated to analyze the statistical data associated
with the four learning style dimensions.
For the Active/Reflective learning style dimension, significant differences between
the two styles can be found in the “Frequency” and “Number of Types” measurements.
This shows that Active participants had a higher tendency to use the Interactive Help
features than Reflective participants. The behavior of frequent visits to online activities
by Active learners was also found by Graf and her colleagues (Graf, Liu, & Kinshuk,
2010).
For the Input (Visual/Verbal) dimension, the two corresponding styles show
significant differences in the “Frequency” and “Time” measurements. Visual participants
frequented Visual Help features, while Verbal participants respectively spent relatively
more time in their favorable Exploring Help features. This result is consistent with the
finding stated by Ford and his colleagues (2009) in which the preference for Verbal users
of orienting to the use of written language as oppose to images was reported by. In their
study, Verbalizers displayed effective reading of text-based content. In addition, the
Verbal users’ tendency of selecting Exploring Help features for verbal design and
scanning characteristic were also supported by other researchers (Chen et al., 2005; FriasMartinez et al., 2008; Kinley, 2010).
Regarding the Perceiving (Sensing/Intuitive) dimension, the two specific styles
exhibit significant differences only in the “Frequency” measurement of Scaffolding Help.

176
It was found, as can be expected, that Intuitive participants used the Scaffolding help
more effectively than their Sensing counterparts.
Finally, the testing measurements for the Understanding (Sequential/Global)
dimension did not indicate any significant differences between the two groups of
participants. Thus, no clear quantitative evidence were found to support for the
qualitative analyses for the first research question carried out in section 4.1 in which
certain different tendencies between the two groups were found existed. However, the
study conducted by Papaeconomou and his colleagues (2008) showed that Sequential
users adopted significantly more sequential strategy to navigating web pages.
In summary, the t-test results indicate the existence of significant effects for learning
styles on users’ use of different types of help features. Except for the Understanding
(Sequential/Global) dimension, the significant effects were found for three learning styles
dimensions of Processing (Active/Reflective), Input (Visual/Verbal), and Perceiving
(Sensing/Intuitive). The study conducted by Graf and her colleagues (2009) also found
similar results for Active/Reflective, Visual/Verbal, Sensing/Intuitive, but no results for
Sequential/Global.
Several studies in the literature have investigated users’ behavior in online
information searching environments with respect to learning styles (e.g. Ford et al., 2009;
Frias-Martinez et al., 2007; Graf et al., 2007; Liu & Reed, 1994; Lee et al., 2005;
Palmquist & Kim, 2000; Tenopir et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2000). However, this study is
different in several ways. First, the study aimed at investigating the help-seeking behavior
in typical digital library environments. Therefore, the study was based on two real digital

177
libraries commonly used by academic users rather than in a specific prototype system.
Second, while many other studies looked at general search behavior in terms of how users
formulate queries or visited specific kinds of web nodes, this study has focused on
exploring help-seeking behavior. Thirdly, this study identifies the effects of various
learning styles in four dimensions of ILS on help-seeking behavior rather than focusing
on just one particular learning style. Furthermore, this study is based on a learning style
theory which is commonly used in information retrieval and online learning environments,
and thus the corresponding findings seem relatively more widely applicable.
In educational environments, learning is to change. Learning involves the process of
bringing about changes in learners’ knowledge. This study considers information seeking
and searching as a learning process and adopts the construct of ‘learning style’ in
investigating help-seeking behavior. Previous literatures in education field had identified
that learning styles deeply affect how students process information in learning activities.
These learning activities include learning performance, learning strategies, and learning
preferences (Felder & Silverman, 1988; Rickards et al., 1997; Sadler-Smith, 1999; Wang
& Chen, 2008). In this study, results indicate that learning styles influence users’ helpseeking approaches, yet not all dimensions of learning styles were verified to have similar
influence on users’ help-seeking behavior or their specific use of help features. The pace
of learning and that of help-seeking interactions in information retrieval are quite
different, thus the corresponding dimensions of the selected learning styles are not as
applicable in the IR settings as in the educational environments.

178

5.2.2. Help-seeking Approaches
Participants with different learning styles exhibit various dimensions of help-seeking
interactions when searching information in digital libraries. Help-seeking highlights how
users deal with problems they encounter in the information search process. Learning
styles determine how users approach the problems encountered in their help-seeking
process. Different learning styles affect the types of help features which users identify
and the help-seeking approaches that users might engage in different of digital libraries.
For the Processing dimension, Active and Reflective learners present their respective
types of engagement in the interactions with help features. These two types of learners
prefer different types of help features and different ways to approach help features. For
the Input dimension, Visual and Verbal learners also prefer help features with their
respective formats. Regarding the Perception dimension, Intuitive and Sensing learners
prefer different types of information for help. Intuitive learners learn how to utilize help
features by analyzing the structure of the help design and matching between different
help features.
This research is one of the few studies that investigates multiple dimensions of
learning styles on help-seeking, and characterizes users’ interaction patterns in the helpseeking process. Simultaneously, the findings of this study also reveal the problems of
existing digital libraries that are unable to support multiple types of learning styles.
Moreover, this study offered specific and concrete system design suggestions based on
results of this research.

179

5.2.3. Linking Help-seeking Approaches to Help-seeking Process
By introducing the concept of help-seeking earlier in section 2.4 of this study, the
Nelson-Le Gall’s model explains that help-seeking behavior is generally accepted as
consisting of five major cognitive processes: the five phases of the help-seeking
processes are Awareness (awareness of need for help) ; Decision (decision to seek help);
Identification (identification of potential helpers); Employment (employment of strategies
to elicit help); and Evaluation (reactions to help-seeking attempts) (Nelson-Le Gall et al.,
1983; Nelson-Le Gall, 1985). For the sake of theoretical precision and usefulness, it
would be profitable to link the taxonomy that emerged from this study to the general
model of help-seeking. As can be expected, making connections to a broader model
enriches our understanding of the specific qualities of help-seeking behavior and helps to
answer the research questions.
In interpreting the linking data, the various types of influence of learning style appear
to link to the four processes of the model simultaneously. In other words, one type of
influence could represent at the same time more than one model’s process. The linking is
not restricted to a one-to-one relationship. For example, the ‘Engagement in selecting and
using help features’, which is the associated influence with the Active/Reflective
dimension, can be linked to ‘Decision’, ‘Identification’ and Evaluation’, while the
influence category of ‘Application of strategies to make sense of and understand DLs and
their function’ represent the anticipated link to ‘Identification’ and ‘Evaluation’. The
linking also provides an insight into the effect of respective characteristics of each
learning style dimension on the Help-seeking processes and shows the precise relation in

180
which each influence items contained several processes. Since the participants were
asked to consider the use of help features at the beginning of the test, the Awareness
process was presumably a pre-existing condition for all participants. Thus only the
remained four phases of the Nelson-Le Gall’s model were addressed in the following
context. Based on the results of the analysis task carried out in section 4.3, the linking
relation between the Help-seeking processes and types of help-seeking approaches is
summarized in details in Table 5.1.
The linking provides an important insight into the understanding that the help-seeking
approaches identified in this study. The help-seeking approaches mainly focus on two
help-seeking processes, namely Identification (identification of potential helpers) and
Employment (employment of strategies to elicit help). Among the fifteen help-seeking
approaches, seven approaches link to the process of Identification and eight approaches
link to the process of Employment.

Practical Implications
Based on the findings of this study, it is concluded that learning styles do affect

participants’ interactions with different help features of digital libraries, and the types of
interactions can be identified accordingly. The characteristics of interactions provide
practical implications for the design of digital libraries to assist users with different types
of learning styles. In particular, the results suggest that digital libraries need to facilitate
the help-seeking approaches by offering different types of help features, different formats
of help, and different ways of organization and presentation of help content. In this work,
the eight recognized learning styles are categorized into four dimensions, namely Process,
Input, Perception, and Understanding. The major findings associated with each dimension
are briefly summarized in the following paragraphs.
For the Processing dimension, Active and Reflective learners present their respective
types of engagement in the interactions with help features. These two types of learners
prefer different types of help features and different ways to approach help features.
Active learners are particularly fond of trying various types of help features. Digital
Libraries are required to offer simple and easy to get on hand features, like “FAQ” or
“Google-like” design. In order to encourage more interaction, Digital Libraries are
required to offer sufficient interactive help features, like “Online Chat” and “Ask a
Librarian”, which provides the opportunity for users to interact with a real human who
provides real-time, dynamic, and relevant guidance for users. Implicit feedback has been
used in IR research to infer user preference (Kelly & Teevan, 2003). Since Reflective
users play a comparatively passive role in the interaction, it is relatively difficult to guide

185
Reflective learners to adopt more help features. Recommending and promoting new
features to Reflective learners can be feasible to urge them to try new help features.
Implicit feedback options (such as “Search History”, “Breadcrumbs”, “Try this”, etc.)
are effective approaches to propose appropriate types of implicit help features to
Reflective learners so as to help them participate more actively in the interaction. It is
also recommended to provide a “Personalized note” functionality to help Reflective
learners to record their own thoughts, understanding, or even mistakes along the way of
search process. It is generally helpful to display each help feature with a clear label
specifying its function and usage, because Reflective learners do not select help features
for which the functionality is vague. Most important of all, the help features should be
designed to reduce uncertainty, which means a good help feature contains a reasonably
formatted structure.
For the Input dimension, Visual and Verbal learners also prefer help features with
their respective formats. Visual content can be expressed with a syntactic (e.g., color,
shape, texture and layout) or a semantic (e.g., objects, events, etc.) level of structure
(Jorgensen, Jaimes, Benitez, & Chang, 2001). According to Jaimes & Chang (2000),
“syntax refers to the way visual elements are arranged without considering the meaning
of such arrangements. Semantic, on the other hand, deals with the meaning of those
elements and of their arrangements.” It is demonstrated in several previous studies that
humans mainly use semantic level attributes to describe, classify, search, and process
images (Greisdorf & O'Connor, 2002; Jorgensen, 1995; Jorgensen, 1998). In general,
Visual learners perceive and process both syntax and semantic levels of visual help
features during the IR interactions. While the existing digital libraries emphasize

186
syntactic content for users, such as color and layout of interface design, specifying
semantic levels of structure to users is also essential. Objects, people, and events are
particularly needed to be highlighted and structured to assist users in identifying
information and enhancing their domain knowledge as well. It should be noted that not all
users like visual formats of help; it is thus important to offer both visual and verbal
formats of help features. For example, Chen et al. (2005) recommended one possible
solution which combines both verbal cue and visual cue concurrently in the same feature
in order to accommodate different styles. Another way of accommodating both formats
can be carried out by showing multiple options for the help features. Using “how to
search?” as an example, this specific feature can be associated with two options: a visual
display of how to search and a narrative presentation of how to search. Besides, visual
versions can normally be presented in images or videos while verbal versions can be
presented in a text or an audio format.
Regarding the Perceiving dimension, Intuitive and Sensing learners prefer different
types of information for help. Intuitive learners learn how to utilize help features by
analyzing the structure of the help design and matching between different help features.
They want to know how exhaustive in scope, how comprehensive in depth, and varied
types of format the DLs content would be. The function providing such overview
prerequisite information is missing or inadequate in current digital library design. Digital
libraries need to be transparent not only in content coverage, but also in design principles,
so users can better understand the design structure of the system. Moreover, it is
important to offer information regarding the similarities and differences between different
types of help features, especially equivalent features in each system. On the contrary,

187
Sensing learners avoid using unfamiliar help features and like to follow concrete
examples in help features. When solving problems, they prefer to be well-prepared with
already learnt procedures or pre-existing practical settings. As a result, it is recommended
to design digital libraries with standard layouts (e.g. a Google-like design) with consistent
help features that would help Sensing learners to build a base for adjusting and learning a
new system. Digital libraries can provide users with more help features that contain
tangible information, in particular more options for browsing, e.g., timeline, most viewed
terms, etc. More search examples in different domains or material formats are definitely
helpful to assist Sensing learners in their search processes.
For the Understanding dimension, Sequential and Global learners prefer different
ways of help content organization and presentation. The design of help features for the
digital library needs to offer help contents with step-by-step instructions and
comprehensive overviews with context, to facilitate both types of learners in
understanding a digital library’s features; regardless individually or as a whole. Chen and
her colleagues (2005) recommended offering successive options, which provide outlines
and links of related contents to accommodate different styles in web directories. In order
to support both types of learners in digital library environment, it is suggested that linear
backward and forward paths options should be provided for Sequential learners to move
freely from one item to another, and more directing links to related help content and
logical outline of help content should be available for Global learners. More importantly,
it is helpful to generate a sitemap for all the explicit and implicit help features so as to
provide users with all the potential help features and to demonstrate the relationships
among all the features.

188
In summary, this study was conducted in University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, an
academic environment in mid-west area. From interacting with the two Digital Libraries,
novice users from the academic institute were not able to find the answer immediately
and encountered problematic situations. They adopted various help-seeking approaches to
solve their problems at hand based on their learning preferences. This should suggest to
digital librarians to incorporate different types of help-features into their DL platforms.
Not all users are willing to take the risk trying out all the help-feature. The results may
point the way toward the design and delivery of digital library services, such as a more
engaging processing layouts, diversified input formats, as well as easy-to-perceive and
easy-to-understand modes of help features. The key for the design of digital libraries is to
totally support novice users with different types of learning styles.

5.4

Methodological Implications
According to Case, one way to conduct both valid and reliable research is to apply

multiple research methods and multiple sources of data (Case, 2002). It is so true that
many researchers share this point of view and advocate the use of triangulation
(Silverman, 2005; Patton, 2002). However, the use of mixed method research is not a
common practice in the literature of library and information science (Fidel, 2008). This
study adopts mixed-method in data collection and analysis with the purpose to address
the research problem more widely and more completely than employing only one method.
The qualitative method was used first to explore novice users’ help feature use in digital

189
library as well as the influence of learning styles during the information search process. It
is then the quantitative measures that we can rely on to verify the exploratory findings.
The mixed approach of both qualitative and quantitative can be used in a
complementary fashion to answer all the research questions. The main focus is to
carefully look for the degree of convergence between the two approaches (Denzin, 1978;
Denzin & Lincoln, 2005). This study tackled the difficult problem of uncovering helpseeking behaviors in a way that was as authentic as possible of novice users. The results
therefore reflect the real help-seeking behaviors as it occurs in the real world. Using the
qualitative methods outlined in this study, the researcher was able to uncover a wide
spectrum of the participants' patterns of help-seeking approaches. The mixed methods
used to deal with the many challenges presented by this study may provide a
methodological guideline for others who are designing user-centered approaches to the
investigation of thoughts and feelings related to help-seeking behavior.
It is also worth noting that there are several disadvantageous factors of the mixedmethod approach. The two-phase approach, including the qualitative exploratory and
quantitative verification, results in rich and informative data yet this type of study is timeconsuming and labor-intensive in both data collection and analysis. Future researchers
need to recognize this factor and plan ahead of time. In addition, it is difficult to specify
and determine what data from the qualitative phase to be connected to the quantitative
observation and how these data to be used to generate quantitative measurements.

Conclusions
This dissertation investigated users' help-seeking behavior in the context of digital

libraries. This study assumed that a user engages in an IR process by applying different
types of help features and help-seeking approaches based on their learning styles. Also, in
an attempt to assess the influence of learning style, this study identifies users' helpseeking behavior in using different types of help features and adopting diversified helpseeking approaches. Moreover, this study examined how the four dimensions of learning
styles would influence users’ help-seeking approaches when they encounter problematic
situations. This study empirically answered the research questions based on the analysis
of multiple sources of search data, protocols, and inner thoughts collected from sixty
participants. Finally, limitation of the study and suggestions for further research are
described in the following sections.

5.5.1. Limitation of the Study
A number of important limitations need to be addressed regarding the present study.
These limitations are: limited generalizability, unnatural setting, participants’ limited
ability to articulate, and other related limitations.
First, a limitation of this study can be seen in the restricted numbers of novice users
participating in the study. The limited samples provide valuable information yet it is still
insufficient to be generalized to a broader context. Specifically, the samples of this study
were drawn from different majors out of a chosen college campus located in the Midwest
region, therefore, results of the study can generalized back to the selected academic

191
environment. Although universities are one of the target user groups of digital libraries
and the college students are most suitable as study participants, it might be interesting to
confirm the results with non-college students. Users’ searching behaviors were also
shaped by the types of tasks given to them by the researcher as well. The subject areas of
the selected tasks were more specific to American history and are not generalizable to
other domains of knowledge.
The second limitation of this study is related to the uneven distribution of learning
styles. Although sixty participants were recruited for the study, the researchers did not
know in advance what the learning style of the incoming participants were. After the
study, the learning style scores were calculated and based on the answers provided by
participants. The distribution for the Input dimension is pretty skewed toward the Visual
styles.
Thirdly, there is a limitation of the study caused by the simulated nature of
experimental setting. The unnatural setting can possibly influences the way participants
normally search for information (Oh & Wildemuth, 2009). The computer labs settings are
known to be sometimes problematic. Due to the time constrain of the study experiment,
participants were allowed to search for a limited period of time, around 10 minutes, for
each task. If participants were still searching for the task and the ten minutes ran up, the
researcher had to stop participants and proceeded to the next task. This situation
potentially influences the observation of participants’ help-seeking behavior and caused
the low number of frequency in the use of Reflective Help Features and Verbal Help
Features, thus the two help features were not included in the quantitative testing.

192
Likewise, it also affects the observation of help features use of Global participants. Their
behaviors of using specific help features were not observed in the experiment setting.
As the experimental observation may be somewhat obtrusive, participants were easily
distracted by the intention of the researcher or aspects of the experiment setting.
Additionally, participants might not show exactly the same help-seeking interaction in
this study as in real-life authentic tasks. The searching tasks were carefully selected to
simulate real-life situations and all participants cooperated and completed the tasks. It is
believed that the research findings may contain minor bias yet it reasonably reflects users’
realistic behavior.
Next, although verbal protocol analysis can truthfully record what participants are
thinking during their information-retrieval process, particularly their thoughts related to
help seeking, participants might have difficulty articulating their cognitive processes. Xie
and Cool (2009) pointed out that not every participant in their study provided the detailed
information related to what defined help seeking situations and what led to these
situations. Other researchers were concerned with the problem that the verbal protocol
might significantly influence performance and change behavior (Oh & Wildemuth, 2009).
Finally, there was also some subjectivity of the data collected from interview and
self-report data. The subjectivity may be caused by factors such as the possible distorted
responses due to personal bias, anger, anxiety, politics, and simple lack of awareness (Oh
& Wildemuth, 2009). Interviews can be greatly affected by the emotional state of the
interviewee at the time of the interview. Interview or self-report data can also be
subjected to recall error, reactivity of the interviewee to the interviewer, and self-serving

193
responses. Besides, the participants themselves may also bias the performance due to
social desirability or self-representation. Thus, they tend to present themselves being
intelligent and well-adjusted or make unnecessary inferences.

5.5.2. Suggestions for Future Research
First, the four different dimensions of the ILS learning styles were explored to
evaluate their influence over novice users’ help-seeking behavior in this study. It is
recommended for future research to focus on one primary dimension of learning style at a
time in order to investigate the impact of learning style dimension more in-depth. In
addition to the frequency, the time, and the number of types of help feature used, the
measurements of effectiveness and users’ satisfaction can also be included in future
research.
Secondly, learning styles were explored to evaluate their influence over novice users’
help-seeking behavior. It is recommended that further research can consider examining
more cognitive factors. In the qualitative phase of this study, the learning styles were
identified to have influence on novice users’ help-seeking approaches. Other cognitive
factors, such as motivational belief, self-efficacy, meta-cognitive knowledge, and selfregulated learning need to be explored. However, due to the limited scale of time and
resources of this study, the concurrent investigation on multiple cognitive factors would
not be feasible. Future work can investigate other cognitive factors with focuses on their
potential cognitive influence on help-seeking behaviors.

194
Since digital libraries serve a wide range of diverse users via the internet, an
expanded number of participants with equally represented learning style are needed to
draw more generalized conclusions. Future research can be designed to have diversified
real users and real tasks with prolonged time of observation so as to obtain more realistic
data collected from better-specified measurable instruments (e.g. clickable data, eye
tracking device, or wearable real-time device) that represent real help-seeking behaviors
as in a natural context.
Finally, different methodologies can potentially be adopted for future research. The
mixed-method approach is an innovative way to investigate the help-seeking behavior.
Both qualitative the quantitative methodologies were adopted in this study to answer the
research questions. Future research could follow the mixed-method approach to assess
each learning style dimension using different designs. More importantly, better-specified
measurements with new technology can be applied to help digital libraries and other IR
systems to recognize users’ need. These measurements include eye movements, body
movements, facial expressions, gestures, and click-through data. Through the use of such
technology, it can potentially offer more implicit help features in supporting users with
different types of learning styles.
There is an obvious need for more research in the fields of individual differences and
adaptation of IR environments. The purpose of such activity is to gain a better
understanding of how individual differences affect the interaction of learning to use a
new IR system. With such understanding, it will lead to a new IR environment that better
suits the learning need and preference of each novice user. It is also hoped that the

195
various findings of this research could be practically transformed to useful knowledge in
related fields.

Appendix A: Informed Consent Form
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN – MILWAUKEE
CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH
Informed Consent Form for Novice Users (IRB#: 12.353 04/30/2012)
1. General Information
Study title: The Study of Users’ Interactions with Digital Libraries Focusing on
User Engagement, System Support, and Help-Seeking
Person in Charge of Study (Principal Investigator):
Hong (Iris) Xie, Ph.D.
Professor
School of Information Studies
University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
(414)229-6835 (phone)
(414)229-6699 (fax)
2. Study Description
I understand that I have been asked to participate in a research study of investigating the
process of users’ interactions with digital libraries. I understand that my participation is
completely voluntary, and I do not have to participate if I do not want to.
I understand that my participation will take about one and a half hour to complete. I
understand the study will be taken place in the research lab of School of Information
Studies at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
3. Study Procedures
I understand that my participation will involve the following activities:
After the initial contact, the student PI will email me a consent form which includes
information explaining the purpose, procedures, benefits and risks of the study. Once I
agree to participate in the study, I will come to a specified site and submit the form to the
researcher in person. Then, the researcher will send a pre-questionnaire to me through
email and collect background information in relation to using digital libraries. After the

208
researcher receives my pre-questionnaire, I will be asked to come to NWQ building of
UWM for the experiment.
The data will be collected from the following means for users:
1.1) I will fill out a questionnaire which consists of my perceptions and attitudes
toward digital libraries (10-15 minutes).
1.2) I am going to perform searches in digital libraries based on generic tasks
assigned to me. I understand that the searches will be logged and videotaped for
later analysis (60 minutes).
1.3) I will be asked to “think aloud” about what I am doing and why they are doing
that way during my searches. What I say will be recorded on videotape (same as
1.2).
1.4) I will be observed during the search process, and my behaviors as a help system
user will be recorded by software (same as 1.2).
1.5) After all the searches are done, I will fill in the post questionnaire which consists
of my perceptions of the system features in the digital libraries and receive a
interview for elaborating the answers I provided (15-20 minutes).
This visit will take about one and a half hour.
4. Risks

and Minimizing Risks

 I understand that there is no serious risk occurring for subjects in participation in the

research. I understand there is a risk that I may experience embarrassment or anxiety
due to being videotaped and observed while performing searches. I understand that
my image might appear on the video file, although the video file will be mainly made
to capture monitor screen. I understand that my voice will be recorded on the video
file as I think aloud in the search process. I understand that I will ask the student
primary researcher questions and be observed during the searches while I work with
him/her in one room. I also understand the researchers will try to minimize the risk
by only revealing my participant number and not to discuss the study with others.
However, the researchers cannot ensure that breaches of confidentiality will not
occur.


I understand the confidentiality of my responses will be protected at all times when
the data are collected and analyzed, and when the results are reported in a published
paper. No names will be attached to the questionnaires, search log files, and video
files. All data will be stored with a coded subject identification number. Coded data
will be made available for use in the analysis by the researchers. All the information

209
collected for this study and the identifying information of the participants will be
destroyed after the study is complete.
5. Benefits

 I understand that once the study is completed, I will be given $30 for my
participation in the study. I also understand that the long term benefit of the study
will be the design of better digital libraries that will help users effectively retrieve
information based on the results of the study.
6. Study

Costs

I will not be responsible for any of the costs from taking part in this research study.
7. Confidentiality

All information collected about me during the course of this study will be kept
confidential to the extent permitted by law. The researchers may decide to present
findings to others, or publish our results in scientific journals or at scientific
conferences. Only the PI and co-investigators will have access to the information.
However, the Institutional Review Board at UW-Milwaukee or appropriate federal
agencies like the Office for Human Research Protections may review my records.
 The collected data will be confidential and only revealing each participant’s number.
 All data, including name and associated demographic data, collected from
participants will be stored and kept in locked area by the principal investigators at the
School of Information Studies. The video files will also be stored on a password
protected computer by the principal investigators at the School of Information
Studies. All data will be stored with a coded subject identification number. Coded
data will be made available for use in the analysis by the principal investigators.
 All the information collected for this study and the identifying information of the
individuals will be destroyed after the study is complete.
8. Alternatives

There are no known alternatives available to me other than not taking part in this study.

210
9. Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal
My participation in this study is entirely voluntary. I may choose not to take part in this
study. If I decide to take part, I can change my mind later and withdraw from the study.
I am free to not answer any questions or withdraw at any time. My decision will not
change any present or future relationships with the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee.
If am a current student taking class with the principal investigator, my refusal to take
part in the study will not affect my grade or class standing. If I withdraw from the study,
all information collected will be destroyed.
