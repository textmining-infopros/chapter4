ABSTRACT
MICHELLE MILLER
MATURE LEARNERS AND INFORMATION LITERACY INSTRUCTION IN
ACADEMIC LIBRARIES: HOW LIS PROGRAMS PREPARE ACADEMIC
LIBRARY INSTRUCTORS FOR ADULT EDUCATION ROLES
DECEMBER 2016
The purpose of this study was to determine the availability of instruction courses
at library and information science programs (LIS) in the US, and to what extent LIS
programs address adult learning theory and instruction in the context of library
instruction. Previous studies identified instruction courses at all American Library
Association (ALA) accredited programs in the US; however, these studies did not
delineate courses as K12 or non-K12 focused, nor did they explore adult learning theory
topic inclusion. This study analysed course availability at 50 ALA-accredited programs in
the US and used content analysis of instruction and academic library syllabi acquired
from current LIS instructors and via course and faculty websites. Content analysis was
undertaken using purposeful coding based on the assumptions of adult learning
developed by the researcher by combining Association of College and Research Libraries
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education and Malcolm
Knowles’ assumptions of adult learning delineated in the adult learning theory
andragogy. SPSS was used to conduct quantitative analysis of course syllabi to determine
significant associations between syllabus elements. Findings show availability of
v

instruction courses is extensive, but not universal, and that adult learning theory and
instruction has minimal presence in current LIS programs. Suggestions for LIS program
course development and future course content development are made based on the
present study’s findings and evidence from extant research.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Information in the Digital Age
There is little question that recent and continual evolution in information
technology has and will continue to impact the way we as a society live and think. One of
the many examples of this trend is personal information communication technology
(ICT) and the networks on which it runs. Smartphones, data networks, and Wi-Fi all have
become increasingly mainstream, offering the average American the opportunity to
gather information at any place or time with the mere tap or swipe of a fingertip. Modern
ICTs are becoming less expensive, their use is becoming nearly universal, and the digital
gap in our society is beginning to shrink. In the midst of this information and technology
evolution, librarianship is one of many fields which has been significantly affected. As
access to information has become increasingly immediate and the veracity of these
readily available information and information sources progressively uncertain, the need
for the average individual to possess skills and knowledge to help them navigate an
infinite number of resources is more and more critical.
Librarianship in a Digital Society
Fundamentally concerned with the storage, retrieval, access, and use of
information, this atmosphere of immediate information has given librarianship the
challenge and opportunity to reimagine the role of the library and librarian in a digital
1

society. In particular, academic librarians face a challenge of providing information
services to students who rely heavily on and are often quite adept in the use of ICTs.
However, higher education students’ ability to use information wisely and effectively is
often limited. As a result, one area of academic librarianship which has been notably
impacted by advancements in information technology has been its complex and
inextricable relationship with information literacy. Information literacy has long been
considered an important part of lifelong learning and traditionally takes roots in libraries,
particularly in higher education. The digital age has increased the value of the knowledge
and skills associated with information literacy requiring academic libraries to respond by
ensuring their users are given the opportunity to develop and implement these
increasingly necessary proficiencies.
Information Use and Behavior in the Digital Age
Information literacy has been within the purview of library instruction for decades
in relation to or falling under the umbrella of the field of information seeking and
acquisition. Carol Kulthau’s (1993, 2005) Information Seeking Behavior research has
provided significant evidence on the specific behaviors of individuals as they seek
information and has been used within librarianship to support the evolution of library
services and librarian behaviors, including the provision of information literacy training.
Similarly, Brenda Dervin’s (1998) Sense-Making Theory has been used to help librarians
understand the knowledge acquisition process employed by individuals as they seek, find,
and utilize information sources. Kulthau and Dervin’s theories have been used with
2

success to help librarians tailor instruction services. However, as academic librarians face
the challenges of continually changing information sources and exponentially growing
amounts of information, it is important they continue to strive to develop and adapt
services in order to provide library users with instruction able to help them develop and
maintain information literacy skills that will empower students in our information-rich
culture.
The Changing Face of Higher Education
In addition to the digital evolution, recent trends in student enrollment in
institutions of higher education are causing academic libraries to reconsider how their
services meet the needs of all students. Traditional undergraduates have long been
understood to be a cohort who matriculate to colleges and universities directly out of high
school. However, non-traditional students increasingly make up a significant portion of
student populations. The category of non-traditional students has been used to refer to
groups of students defined by characteristics ranging from economic status, culture,
background, ethnic origin, or gender/sexual identification. However, one non-traditional
student group in particular posing unique challenges to academic librarians is adult
students. Though some research identifies adult learners as those age 25 and above, this is
often seen as too simplistic a categorical definition because maturity levels do not always
coincide with age. Another, broader definition identifies adult students as those who have
entered into life outside of school and are returning to academia with other life priorities.
Though adult students have long been a recognized cohort on higher education campuses,
3

as graduate students and returning undergraduates, their numbers are on the rise. Higher
education opportunities in the U.S. are increasingly sought and undertaken by returning
or mature students. The National Center for Education Statistics notes that the percentage
of students age 25 or older has increased by 42% from 2000 to 2010, with the percentage
of students under 25 increasing only 34% (NCES, 2012). As students enter higher
education with increasing maturity, it is important to recognize that they have different
learning needs than traditional students and information literacy instruction provided by
academic librarians must be able to accommodate a variety of learning needs, including
those of adults.
Developing Understanding of Mature Learners
Formal theories about adult learning gained increasing popularity as an
independent sub-category within the field of education in the mid-twentieth century,
coinciding with the end of the Second World War and an increasing number of lifeexperienced adults seeking formal education opportunities (Jarvis, 2004). In contrast to
pedagogical learning which focused on dictated goals and relies on instructor supplied
identification of relevance and motivation to an undeveloped student, adult learning
theories recognize mature students’ needs for increased practical applicability, use of
higher-order thinking and reasoning, reliance on established personal life experience, the
importance of professional and social roles of individuals, and personal responsibility and
self-motivation in the learning process. The proliferation of adult learning theories

4

appears in direct correlation to our increasingly technologically complex information
structure and society (Houghton, 2001).
Library Instruction in the Modern Higher Education Landscape
The professional responsibility of facilitating the development of information
literacy skills for all higher education students falls often within the realm of library
instruction. Early manifestations of instruction by librarians dealt largely with navigating
the library itself, including understanding classification systems, using various types of
information, and managing bibliographic sources. As information sources and roles of
librarians as information experts have become more complex, so too has the purpose of
library instruction. In higher education, librarians have become integral to the
development of students who are experienced in and capable of research. Library
instruction has expanded to include traditional bibliographic topics, such as managing
information references and citations and navigating library resources, and also more
recently critical topics such as research planning, online information use and evaluation,
and the use of an ever-expanding number of information communication technologies.
The provision of this instruction comes in a myriad of venues and methods from online
tutorials, one-shot interventions, and serial in-library lessons. The variety of topics and
numerous methods in which instruction is provided makes library instruction very
different from its sister discipline of education. As a result, it is the purview of
professional library education to provide future librarians with the skills and knowledge

5

they will need to undertake the critical role of instruction librarian with skill and
confidence.
Skills for Modern Librarianship
Library instruction is a crucial duty to many academic librarians. Studies of job
advertisements and surveys of supervisor expectations show a clear trend of the
increasing requirement that academic librarians are willing and able to provide library
instruction, often focusing on information literacy skills, to students in higher education.
Wang, Tang, and Knight reviewed the inclusion of instruction in reference librarian job
descriptions over time in order to shed some light on relevant trends. They found that
between 1966 and 1969 only six positions included instruction. The following decades
saw a steady rise in instruction named in job description with 184 in 1970-1979, followed
by a surge to 1,212 from 1980-1989, and 1,645 from 1990-1999. By 2000-2009, this
number had decreased minimally to 1,494 (2010). These numbers potentially suggest
inclusion of instruction in reference roles was beginning to find its level in the first
decade of the century. A content analysis of 1,000 adverts for positions for recent
graduates found that 63.3% of the entry level positions posted in the spring of 2009 were
academic library roles (Reeves & Hahn, 2010). Detmering and Sproles found in a review
of entry level reference positions posted to several online library job websites and listservs between January and December 2010 that nearly all (98.9%) included description
of some instructional duties (2012). And in a survey conducted on employers who had
recently advertised librarian positions, Hall found that 65% reported that instruction skills
6

were required of a successful candidate. And, for 28% of the posts advertised at least
50% of the job workload would be developing and delivering instruction (2013). This
small but telling sample of research regarding the changing roles of librarians suggests
strongly that the role of academic librarians as instructors is significant.
Preparing Librarians for Their Roles
Amidst the changes in student population and demand for academic librarians to
provide the instruction critical to helping students develop information literacy, research,
and library skills they need to navigate a world of infinite information, it is increasingly
important that librarians emerge from their library and information science (LIS)
programs able to develop and provide effective instruction. However, there is some
concern that LIS programs which are often focused on providing their students with
theory-based knowledge are failing to provide enough opportunity and experience with
practical skills such as instruction. As evidenced by research conducted into expectations
from library managers and directors, practical skills are highly desired if not required of
entry-level librarians. As LIS schools continue to graduate new librarians, it is important
that the content of the programs are suited to help their students develop the skills they
will need to be hired and work as new librarians. At present, there is a small body of
research examining the extent to which LIS programs address instruction in their
curricula. However, there is no existing study focusing on the coverage of instruction for
adult learners in LIS courses. In an effort to ensure academic librarians are able to
provide effective information literacy instruction to all students, it is important to
7

understand how LIS schools are preparing professional librarians to teach information
literacy to adult students. The present study examined the current state of LIS curricula
and courses in ALA-accredited programs in the US in order to understand the extent to
which instruction for adult learners is addressed. The following chapters include a review
of extant literature, research design and methodology, data collection and analysis, results
and discussion, and a conclusion summarizing findings and providing suggestions meant
to inform future development of LIS courses and course topics in the future.

CHAPTER II
REVIEW OF LITERATURE
The scope of librarians as instructors covers several distinct yet related subjects
within the field of LIS and associated fields of education theory and higher education.
The following review addresses information literacy, which is the traditional and often
primary goal and/or content of library instruction, and continues with a review of library
instruction literature including studies relating to practice, education for library
instruction, and librarian instructor perspective studies. In addition, a review of adult
learning theory is given, focusing on the assumptions of the adult learning theory
andragogy. A review of methodology will be discussed in its respective chapter of the
current proposal.
History and Evolution of Information Literacy
The concept of information literacy was first expressed by the Information
Industry Association then-president Paul Zurkowski in 1974 who described information
literacy as a proficiency in information use related to an individual’s work (Eisenberg,
Lowe, & Spitzer, 2004). Within two years, the ability to evaluate information critically
was added to the concept of what it is to be information literate. In response to increasing
prevalence and access to personal technologies, in 1989 the American Library
Association Presidential Committee on Information Literacy provided the first popular
definition of information literacy which included specific skills.
9

Concepts and Standards of Information Literacy
Within the first few decades the burgeoning field of information literacy and its
sister LIS-discipline information seeking behaviors had made a significant impact in
academic library research. Authors such as Kuhlthau (1993) and Dervin (1998) have
infiltrated the literature of academic libraries and reference librarianship with theoretical
perspectives that help practicing librarians understand information literacy as a usercentered process. In 2000, the Association of College and Research Libraries published
their “Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education” which currently acts as a
benchmark for information literacy of the academic library user. In the years since its
approval, ACRL’s “Standards” has become the mainstay for academic libraries when
identifying information literacy outcomes.
This core skill set, which includes identifying need, locating information,
evaluating information, and communicating information gathered has existed as the
primary definition of information literacy though others have expanded the definition to
include additional skills and specific information literacy types, such as digital literacy
and visual literacy (Eisenberg et al., 2004). Developments in an ever-changing
technology-driven information environment have required academic librarians to adapt
the ACRL “Standards” to adequately address this exponential growth in information and
information sources. This inclusion of various specific information literacies, as well as
the advancement of technologies into the academic library have significantly impacted
both research and practice in information literacy.
10

Growth of information availability. As the amount of information on the
internet continues to grow, the task of the information literate user to effectively identify
and evaluate appropriate information is complicated. Information literacy instruction can
be seen to reflect this increasingly challenging task by addressing the evaluation process
in information literacy in direct context (Eisenberg et al., 2004). Students show common
tendencies to rely on the internet as their primary source for information (Connaway,
Dickey, & Radford, 2011). Ever increasing reliance on, and contribution to the internet as
an information platform and resource has presented a challenge to academic librarians
who seek to prepare students to become successful and educated information users (Alire
& Evans, 2010; Budd, 2005). Academic librarians providing information literacy must be
aware not only of the potential to guide students toward more reliable resources such as
library subscription databases but also to aid students in the development of the skills
they will need to sort through and intelligently appraise information.
Defining Information Literacy
The ability to identify and evaluate information effectively is critical to the
individual wishing to engage successfully and effectively in society. With advancements
in personal technologies and an increasingly interactive internet, it is crucial that
individuals are able to identify “good” information and are able to recognize “bad”
information as well. Within higher education, it has traditionally been the role of the
academic librarian to provide information literacy instruction to students in order to
empower them to this end.
11

Theoretical foundations. Several theoretical models of information literacy
instruction have been developed within this area of research. Kuhlthau’s Information
Seeking developed through her study of high school students’ information literacy
competence and information seeking behavior. Information Seeking Theory poses that
information literacy is a process beginning with hesitation and anxiety when the
information problem is posed which translates to increasing information seeking
confidence as the user focuses her information query (Kuhlthau, 2004, 2005). According
to Kuhlthau’s Information Seeking, information literacy should be studied through
holistic research methodologies which recognize the progression of information seeking
behavior. Critical to understanding Kuhlthau’s theory is the recognition of information
literacy as a necessary component of lifelong learning (Kuhlthau, 1993).
The Big6 Skills theory of information literacy similarly outlines information
literacy as a repetitive and malleable process (Lowe & Eisenberg, 2005). The Big6 is a
set of six skills designed to help students use information to solve problems or answer
questions. Undertaken in a stepwise approach, in this model the information user defines
the information task, identifies information seeking strategies, identifies location and
obtains access to the information, employs the information, synthesizes multiple sources
of information, and evaluates the resulting findings or produce (Big6, 2014). The Big6
Skills strategy for information literacy, supported by Kuhlthau’s Information Seeking
research has been used widely and was designed for use with students at any level
(Eisenberg & Berkowitz, 1988). The theoretical framework of Big6 can be applied to
12

help library and other instructors integrate successful information searching processes
into their curriculum. As a pedagogical theory, the Big6 Skills models information
seeking and information literacy as stepwise problem-solving activities (Big6, 2014). The
Big6 Skills model is often used when instructors need or wish to guide students through
the information seeking process directly (Lowe & Eisenberg, 2005).
Dervin developed a method of looking at information seeking as a process of the
individual making sense of communication that gives meaning to the information (Dervin
& Nilan, 1986). Dervin’s Sense-Making allows researchers to conceptualize the
information process as a task of understanding or making sense of various types of
information (Dervin, 1998; Tidline, 2005). Dervin’s theoretical framework can be used to
connect information literacy with other communication and information studies.
Additional information literacy models include Irving’s Information Skills (1985),
Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000), and American Association of
School Librarians (AASL) Standards for the 21st-Century Learner (2007). ACRL and
AASL standards outline specific application of information literacy and emphasize a step
progression through the process of becoming and maintaining information literacy skills
(Eisenberg et al., 2004). Of these the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards
for Higher Education (ILCSHE) (2000) was the most commonly used model of
information literacy standards in the extant research. In 2016, the ACRL Board of

13

Directors adopted a new model to replace the ILCSHE called the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (2016).
A 1992 Delphi Study by Doyle sought to define information literacy and its
expected outcomes. The 56 member expert panel articulated the process of identifying
and evaluating information as a lifelong learning process and identified 10 specific
attributes of the information literate individual (Doyle, 1992). While the majority of
information literacy models emphasize the concept of information literacy as an abstract
skill set, Bruce approached the process with specific attention to how the individual
understands information literacy. Her research identified seven different faces (or
conceptions) of information literacy ranging from technology conception to control
conception to wisdom conception (Bruce, 1997). Bruce’s contribution to the field is
significant in that she provides the users’ perspectives of what information literacy
means.
Though the models and definition of information literacy presented by Doyle
(1992), Kuhlthau (1993, 2004, 2005), Eisenberg and Berkowitz (1990), and the AASL
(2007) and ACRL (2000, 2016) are critical to defining the area as a specific domain of
research and practice, Bruce demonstrates that the individual perception of information
literacy should be understood in order to provide effective, efficient, and holistic
information literacy instruction. As information continues to expand in meaning, size,
and availability it is crucial that researchers and instructors are aware of their students’
ideas about information literacy in order to establish strong value of information literacy
14

skills. Though the theoretical models vary, as a whole the models present information
literacy, both acquisition and practice, as a mental process rather than a specific ability or
trait. This concept of information literacy as a process has informed research regarding
the nature and scope of information literacy. In addition, the information literacy and
information seeking models serve as theoretical foundations for a substantial amount of
information literacy research.
It is clear from reviewing the dominant information literacy models in use today
that information literacy is a concept whose definition, though not universally agreed
upon word for word, is generally defined through similar theoretical frameworks, as a
process of identifying information need, locating information sources, evaluating
information, and communicating information.
Value of Information Literacy
To most librarians, educators, and other information professionals, information
literacy is considered a critical skill set. However, the value of information literacy is
often not as apparent as other academic skills and domains within higher education. Yet,
information literacy is empowering and aids in students’ abilities to develop other
academic skills. Viewing information literacy as the critical skill set for the information
uptake process makes it clear that information literacy is a valuable attribute. Pitts (1995)
found that students class questions or information dilemmas by first categorizing the
problem into a knowledge domain and that a lack of knowledge in any one domain
necessarily limits the ability to augment other domains. That is, if information literacy
15

skills are low students are directly hindered in their ability to learn about subject matter.
Along these lines, several researchers have demonstrated that information literacy
instruction is most effective when presented with subject knowledge material (Badke,
2005; Hall, 2008; Todd 1995; York & Vance, 2009). In research on the transition from
high school to college with respect to information literacy, Goodin (1991) determined
that students who received bibliographic instruction, a form of information literacy
instruction, were much more successful in their college research projects than students
who did not receive the training. Existing research also focuses on the trends in education
which demonstrate the value placed on information literacy by educators themselves
(DaCosta, 2010; Leckie & Fullerton, 1999; Singh, 2005).
Though the value of information literacy may seem obvious, the overtones of
what being information literate or not information literate in a world of information may
mean are clear. Without information literacy skills, individuals are inherently limited in
their ability to acquire and use new information. Thus, information literacy is a valuable
skill set that prepares the individual to be a critical consumer of information who is able
to identify, evaluate, understand, and communicate information effectively. Nonetheless,
several gaps exist in the dominate literature which could further illuminate how to
promote the value of information literacy. For example, extant literature fails to explore
the effect of adult education theory on the impact of information literacy instruction in
higher education.

16

Evolution of Information Literacy Instruction
As the landscape of higher education continues to change, so too does information
literacy instruction. The classic model of bibliographic instruction has given way to more
holistic instruction designed to encompass all four primary aspects of information
literacy: identification, locating, evaluating, and communicating information.
Increasingly, information literacy instruction is being provided in conjunction with
traditional classroom learning. This type of point-of-need information literacy instruction
has been investigated by numerous researchers. Breivik (1998) suggests instructors and
librarians work together to provide information literacy instruction in conjunction with
subject instruction. Similarly, when strong faculty-librarian collaboration exists, the blend
of subject and information literacy knowledge appears to students and instructors as
somewhat unified (Black, Crest, & Volland, 2001). Pagowsky (2015) discusses the
ACRL Framework for Information Literacy and challenges presented to academic library
instructors by the neoliberal business model of higher education institutions. She suggests
a reimaging of system and structure through fabulation in order to reinvent the role of
academic librarians and libraries in higher education which would focus on the big
picture of learning rather than skills based education. For additional, and extensive,
coverage of library instruction research, Johnson, Sproles, and Detmering (2010) have
written annual annotated bibliographies of library instruction publications published
annually in the journal Reference Services Review, the first of which covers the year
2009.
17

Meeting the needs of different learners and information literacy instruction.
Currently colleges and universities across the U.S. are enrolling non-traditional age, a
variety of social-identifying, and international students. As addressed in the Introduction,
student populations in higher education in the US are evolving in a myriad of ways, one
of which is average student age. The National Center for Education Statistics notes that
the percentage of students age 25 or older has increased by 42% from 2000 to 2010, with
the percentage of students under 25 increasing only 34% (NCES, 2012). As our students
enter higher education with increasing maturation, it is important to recognize that
information literacy instruction must also change to accommodate different students and
their particular needs. The use of asynchronous tutorials has been one method of making
this adjustment. By using pre-recorded or prepared tutorials, students are able to access
information literacy instruction on their own time, at a point of need, and on their own
pace and level.
Information literacy is also being taken into the classroom and curriculum at some
schools. Practitioners argue that integrating information literacy in the content area and at
a point of need significantly increases student response and retention (Bruce, 2004;
Krause, 2010; Walsh, 2010). Librarians have been working to develop new skills in
pedagogy, andragogy, and collaboration to combine efforts with faculty and instructors to
provide this embedded instruction. Success of multiple cases suggests collaborative and
embedded instruction efforts are likely to continue to be used in library instruction.

Information Literacy and Instruction in Libraries in Higher Education
As a part of the higher education system, academic libraries and their librarians
are in a unique position to provide information literacy instruction to a wide swath of the
population. Existing literature suggests that information literacy is a process, not a finite
skill set, and must be continually kept up through lifelong learning. In addition, the
method and means through which instruction can be provided are continually changing.
Academic librarians must not only remain attuned to these changes but also invested in
evidence and practice based research that may inform future information literacy
instruction. The education theories fueling information literacy instruction and the
methods by which librarians are prepared to offer information literacy are thus
exceptionally important not only to the success of students in the higher education
environment, but also to students as lifelong users and producers of information.
Library and Information Science Education for Library Instruction
The literature addressing the formal preparation of librarian instructors dates back
to 1976 shortly after modern bibliographic instruction first made its appearance in library
and information science (LIS) education (Hogan, 1980). Examination of this literature
reveals themes which will be discussed in order to identify what is known about library
instruction education in LIS programs and what additional research is needed.
Examination of the LIS professional education for librarian instruction research shows
two primary categories from the literature including academic librarian experience and
opinions and examination of LIS school curricula and course content. Each provides
19

critical insight into librarian instructor education and several themes are identified in both
categories. The way in which LIS curricula have developed to address instruction needs
will be reviewed chronologically to highlight the evolution of instruction librarian
education over time. The literature identifying trends and needs among academic
librarian instructors is reviewed with the purpose of stressing themes within this subgroup of literature.
LIS library instruction curricula. The increasingly important role instruction
plays in academic librarianship is well documented. Goetsch (2008) examined position
advertisements posted in College & Research Libraries News in 1995, 2000, and 2005
and determined that instruction, in some cases saw more emphasis than reference in
academic librarian job postings. In a 2013 study, Hall published the results of a survey of
library and information professional employers who had recently advertised a library
position vacancy. Hall reports that 72% of the respondents (N=79) reported instruction
was very important to the position and 65% said instruction skills were a requisite for the
post (2013). Thus it is relevant to the profession as a whole to consider how academic
librarians are being prepared by their professional education for their careers. The
literature examining librarian instruction education is extensive, but not exhaustive.
Beginning in the mid-1970s researchers began to explore the opportunities for
librarians to obtain instruction skills through their LIS program. The first recognized
study of LIS library instruction curriculum emerged in 1976 when researcher Sue
Galloway found only four of 55 U.S. library schools were teaching instruction for credit,
20

though the same study revealed courses were being developed among additional schools
indicating a slow but growing recognition of the need for this type of education. Just over
a year later, Dyer expanded the scope of interest and found that 16 LIS schools offered
credit-bearing courses, modules, or special interest courses focused on library instruction
(1978). However, Dyer’s modest response rate (41.3%, N=63) and expansive criteria for
inclusion made linear comparison of the two studies impractical. A 1980 research study
by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) determined little change
had been made in the status of bibliographic instruction in LIS schools (Hogan, 1980).
Though the study found some programs had added courses in bibliographic instruction,
others which previously offered courses had discontinued the offering. In none of the
programs were the courses established as permanent to the program curricula (Pastine &
Seibert, 1980). Though library instruction had not been fully embraced by LIS programs
as a critical focus for formal education, it was clear that librarians were expected to
understand the importance of instruction in their profession (Hogan, 1980).
In 1985 research into professional education for librarian instruction moved
forward when the ACRL Bibliographic Instruction Section developed a set of
proficiencies for bibliographic instruction in academic libraries. One of the main
objectives of the document was to advise LIS programs on content and learning
objectives for library instruction curricula (Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). The Proficiencies
document was the first to provide some standardization to what was expected from LIS
education of instruction librarians. An examination of syllabi from 1983 to 1986 showed
21

that the presence of library instruction in LIS curriculum was beginning to stabilize with
units or modules on instruction appearing more often than dedicated courses (Larson &
Meltzer, 1987). In 1993 Shonrock and Mulder published the first research focusing on
these proficiencies with the aim of understanding where they were acquired. Only two
proficiencies, concerned with search strategy development and structure of information
within a discipline were acquired in formal education by more than 40% of respondents
(44% and 62% respectively). The remaining 23 proficiencies examined were acquired in
LIS schools by no more than 14% of respondents, with the majority of these proficiencies
acquired by less than 5% (Shonrock & Mulder, 1993). In addition to exploring where the
proficiencies were learned, Shonrock and Mulder’s survey asked where academic
librarians would prefer to learn the proficiencies. Between one- and two-thirds of
respondents indicated they would have liked to learn proficiencies directly relating to
instruction such as lesson planning and curriculum design in their formal LIS education.
These results indicate a significant discrepancy between how instruction librarians were
being educated and what they felt they needed to prepare them for their careers.
In a survey conducted in 1996, Sullivan explored the trend in instruction librarian
education with a survey of 48 ALA-accredited LIS programs. The American Library
Association (ALA), the leading professional organization for librarians in the United
States, plays a critical role in the professional preparation and formal education of
academic, and all librarians in the US. Though 27% of these ALA-accredited LIS
programs had no instruction course or focus in their programs, an impressive 53% offered
22

a course specifically on instruction (Sullivan, 1997). In a 2002 analysis of ALAaccredited LIS program websites, Albrecht and Baron found that 26 of 41 reviewed LIS
programs offered some form of formal education for librarian instructors. However, the
majority of the offerings were designed for school media or library specialist, not
academic librarians. In 2005 a review of LIS education in Europe found that 76% of
schools included content on library instruction in their curriculum (Borup Larsen, 2005).
Similarly in a review of US programs, Pappert’s analysis of 56 ALA-accredited program
websites found that 70.4% offered a course in library instruction while 14.8% offered no
course (2005). In the same year, Julien published the first phase of a longitudinal study of
Canadian LIS programs and an additional study of global perspective and found that just
over half of the 93 LIS programs examined online did not offer a course in library
instruction (2005a).
In an effort to determine how many LIS program graduates were exposed to
library instruction during their professional education, Sproles, Johnson, and Farison
(2008) examined reference course syllabi, course calendars, and assignments and
determined that library instruction was addressed in 26 of the 39 programs which
required all students to take a reference course. In a similar exploration of student
exposure, Click and Walker (2009) surveyed LIS graduates from 2003 to 2008 and found
that 40% reported taking a course covering library instruction, yet just over 30% reported
no such course was offered. This relatively large number of students reporting no course
was available to them seems to conflict with previous studies and with Edwards’ (2009)
23

research which found that 96% of ALA-accredited LIS programs offered a course in
instruction, with 2 of the 56 schools requiring the course of all students. Mbabu (2009)
published a thorough study at the same time indicating only 47 of 57 (82.5%) of ALAaccredited programs offered library instruction courses. The research indicates that by the
late 2000s library instruction was acknowledged as a valuable focus within LIS
education. A further illuminating study by Ishimura and Bartlett (2009) suggests however
that the full picture of library instruction education availability is complicated by the
differences between school media specialist/librarian training and education for academic
and public librarians as instructors. Ishimura and Bartlett found approximately half of the
courses being offered were school library media specific and that the difference in topic
and focus for school library and academic library instruction were notable. Following the
increasingly focused trend of library instruction curriculum research, Bailey (2010)
examined training for academic librarians among ALA-accredited programs reviewing
syllabi from 28 academic library courses. Of these, 24 focus in part on library instruction.
However, Bailey notes theory appeared to receive more attention than instructional
practice and there seemed to be little emphasis on the development of instructional skills.
In an analysis of program websites and review of selected syllabi focusing on the
availability of instruction training for medical library students, Detlefsen found that while
all 58 ALA-accredited programs reviewed offered an instruction course, none were
focused specifically on instruction preparation for medical librarians (2012). Though the
reported prevalence of instruction courses is encouraging, as seen in the previous
24

research Detlefsen does not differentiate between instruction courses focused solely or
primarily of K12 librarians and other instruction courses. A survey conducted of LIS
programs in the state of New York found that instruction courses were offered, but were
not required and often lacked a practical element. A case study of the Library Instruction
Leadership Academy (LILAC) participation by New York MLS students resulted in two
of the LIS programs adopting a for-credit opportunity for their students to participate in
LILAC in the future (Davies-Hoffman, Alvarez, Costello, & Emerson, 2013). This
combination of professional development programs and LIS program course credit
provides some suggestion that limitation of faculty, hours, or funding need not be a
preventative for LIS programs offering credit for library instruction courses outside of the
program itself. Hensley found that courses often struggle to balance the history and
theory critical to instruction with practical experience. A content analysis of 10 selected
LIS program websites explore practical instruction activities informed a follow-up case
study of the development and implementation of an advanced instruction course which
saw students engage in the development, implementation, and evaluation of instruction.
Results suggest that LIS programs will need to look to the future carefully as they plan
courses as the role of instruction librarian becomes increasingly in-demand and complex
(Hensley, 2015). Saunders has offered significant insight into the course offerings and
curriculum of instruction courses in LIS in two recent studies. Using a focus group to
gather qualitative data from practitioners and employers of LIS professional, she found
that the consensus opinion was that LIS graduates lacked hands on instruction experience
25

(Saunders, 2015b). In an extensive review of 54 course syllabi, Saunders (2015a)
explored the topics, theories, requirements of instruction and reference coursed in 58
ALA-accredited programs. Research showed that in 65% of the reference syllabi
examined (N=29) instruction was addressed. However, the extent to which instruction
history, theory, and or praxis were covered varied. While LIS programs currently offer
courses in instruction, past availability and student awareness of the courses may be
limiting the effectiveness of this trend on current librarians (Saunders, 2015a). Further
evidence in support of this idea comes from survey by Goodsett and Koziura of library
practitioners and LIS students which found that though library instruction skills were
considered highly valuable, 16% of those surveyed said they did not have the opportunity
to take a course covering instruction during their LIS education (2016).
It is clear from the literature that the availability of library instruction courses in
LIS education has greatly increased over the past 40 years and they may now be
considered fully available among ALA-accredited LIS programs. However, as the
research generally does not focus on the type of librarian for which the formal courses are
designed, it is not clear how well the need for academic librarians to address library
instruction as a part of their LIS education is currently being addressed. In addition to
understanding what LIS programs are offering in the way of formal education, it is
important to understand how and where academic librarians prefer to learn effective and
useful instruction theories and develop teaching skills.

26

Librarian opinions and experiences with instruction training. From the
literature, it is clear that academic librarians currently obtain their instructional skills in a
variety of ways. One assessment found that 83% of librarians surveyed reported
developing their bibliographic instruction skills through self-study (Mandernack, 1990).
Fifteen years later in an expansive longitudinal study of instruction librarians in Canada
in 1995, 2000, and 2005, Julien (2005b) found that 18.6% of respondents were classed as
instruction librarians and of the librarians reporting instruction among their job tasks,
74.4% held the title of reference librarian. Among these Canadian librarians providing
instruction, a common theme noted by Julien was a concern of their own expertise in
education theory and teaching experience.
Davis (2007) found similar results in a survey of librarians in the US focusing on
teaching anxiety among academic librarians who provide instruction. A significant source
of anxiety was rooted in the respondents concerns about competence and experience in
education theory and praxis. In an experience piece, Slavin and Mead credit their
confidence and success as librarian instructors on practice and experience as a K12
instructor respectively (2008). Olivas (2013) similarly discovered that academic
librarians who had previously worked as K12 teachers cited their previous profession as a
source of pedagogical training and skills development, but still expressed a desire for
library instruction specific education in their LIS education. Julien and Pecoskie (2009)
further develop the understanding of instruction librarian roles and preparation through
interviews with academic librarians which showed that a power imbalance between
27

instruction librarians and faculty contributed to the feeling of ill-ease and low
competence in instruction. From the extant research, it is clear that librarians are aware of
the need for a foundation in education theory and teaching experience in their roles as
academic librarians. However, it is equally clear that the primary source for developing
these skills and practice has been on the job or through outside experience, despite
expressed views of librarians that formal education would be more effective.
Despite increasing availability of LIS courses in librarian instruction, Westbrock
and Fabian (2010) determined that none of the 41 tested proficiencies for bibliographic
instruction developed by the Association of College and Research Libraries Bibliographic
Instruction Section (BIS) were primarily acquired through formal education though this
source was strongly desired. In an earlier study, Walter (2008) similarly juxtaposed
proficiencies and course offerings and determined that while instruction courses were
offered in LIS education, they were not the primary source of education theory and
instruction skills among academic librarians. Julien and Genius (2011) used
constructionist and sociological role theories to establish that librarians relate to their
roles through necessity and task undertaking. They found that only 39.7% of librarians
who responded to their study had participated in formal instruction training. In the UK,
Simmons and Corrall (2010) and Bewick and Corrall (2010) found that academic
librarians with limited experience and those working as subject librarians wished they
had received more formal training in library instruction in their LIS education.

28

In a 2001 case study, Meulemans and Brown uncovered the benefit of combining
formal LIS education and practical experience by examining a semester long practicum in
which library students participated in instruction tasks at academic libraries. Their
findings suggested the combination of theory and praxis was highly effective in
generating a strong knowledge base and preparing librarians’ confidence for future
instruction roles (Meulemans & Brown, 2001). Becnel, Moeller, and Pope (2016) found
that LIS students at Appalachian State University reported only slightly higher perceived
rates of preparation to create and conduct library instruction after serving as embedded
librarians for undergraduate composition courses. Nutefall’s (2012) survey of instruction
interns in academic libraries shared similar findings. However, Cooke and Hensley
(2013) found that while courses are offered, little practical experience providing library
instruction is offered to LIS students significantly hindering their ability to develop
advanced education theory and library instruction praxis. The research indicates that
current academic librarians believe they could have significantly benefited from course
work in library instruction during their LIS program.
With the evident desire to obtain instruction theory and practical skills in LIS
education expressed by academic librarians and the evidence that formal education
opportunities exist, it is critical to under why there continues an apparent disconnect. The
increasingly import of the instruction role among academic librarians shows little sign of
waning. It is therefore in the interest of academic libraries, academic librarians, LIS

29

programs, and higher education to determine how vital skills and competencies are being
acquired.
Adult Learning Theory and Practice
The nature of academic librarianship places librarians at a critical point for
assistance, guidance, and instruction for an increasingly dynamic population of higher
education students. As discussed above, students in higher education today are diverse,
older, and have an increasing pool of life experience to draw upon during their education
experience. It is important that academic librarians are then prepared to instruct young
adult and adult students with methods suitable to their mature styles of learning.
Foundations of Adult Learning Theories
Pedagogy, derived from the Greek word paid meaning “children,” is literally the
science or art of teaching children and has been traditionally used as a base theory for the
development of instruction in United States education (Krippendorff, 2012). However,
the nature of LIS education, and in fact the changing nature of higher education student
populations as a whole, necessitates recognizing the limitations of a child-centric
instruction model and the possible benefits of understanding, developing, and practicing
instruction which recognizes and empowers the special characteristics of mature learners.
Formal theories about adult learning gained increasing popularity as an
independent sub-category within the field of education in the mid-twentieth century,
coinciding with the end of the Second World War and an increasing number of lifeexperienced adults seeking formal education opportunities (Jarvis, 2004). In contrast to
30

pedagogical learning which focuses on dictated goals and relies on instructor supplied
identification of relevance and motivation to an undeveloped student, adult learning
theories recognize mature students’ needs for increased practical applicability, use of
higher-order thinking and reasoning, reliance on established personal life experience, the
importance of professional and social roles of individuals, and personal responsibility and
self-motivation in the learning process. The proliferation of adult learning theories
appears in direct correlation to our increasingly technologically complex information
structure and society (Houghton, 2001).
Andragogy, a Bastion of Adult Learning Theory
Several individual and families of theories comprise the education subfield of
adult learning theory. Among these, andragogy has for over a century represented adult
learning theory as a set of principles or theory developed in direct relationship to the
traditional concept and theory of pedagogy. The term andragogy is derived from the
Greek aner, meaning adult, and agogos, meaning leader or guide. The first known used
of the term andragogy can be traced to a German school teacher who in 1833 wrote about
the necessity of lifelong learning (Knowles, Holton III, & Swanson, 2012). The
watershed for andragogy as a discipline comes from the recognition that adults, due to
unique experiences and needs, learn differently than children. As a result, andragogy
holds that instruction for adults, or mature learns as is sometimes more appropriate,
should be designed to meet adult learning needs which pedagogy fails to recognize or
take into account.
31

Theory and principles of andragogy. In the United States, the development of
andragogy as a set of principles or theory was popularized and is generally credited to
Malcom Knowles. Knowles’ first of many writings about andragogy was published in
1968 and focused on two primary concepts, that learners are self-directed and
autonomous, and teachers are facilitators of learning (Jarvis, 2004; Knowles et al., 2012).
By 1990, Knowles’ andragogy was comprised of six assumptions which reflected and
built upon the previously established concepts. The assumptions of andragogy address the
adult learner as an individual who (1) is autonomous in information need, (2) can direct
his or her own learning, (3) has developed a rich set of life experiences which are relied
upon when learning, (4) has learning needs based on changing social and occupational
roles, (5) is interested in learning based on a specific problem and seeks knowledge for
immediate application, and (6) is internally motivated to learn (Knowles et al., 2012;
Merriam, 2001). Initially andragogy consisted of four assumptions, numbers two through
five above in Knowles’ 1975, 1978, and 1980 iterations of andragogy, with the addition
of assumption six in 1984 and finally assumption one in 1989 and 1990 (Knowles et al.,
2012). The principles are applied to develop and implement instruction to appropriately
address the learning styles of adults.
Criticism of andragogy has, however, posed that its existence as theory is
questionable in part because it does not provide a definition of learning (Baumgartner,
2003; Merriam, 2001; Pew, 2007). This has often led both supporters and detractors of
andragogy to describe the concept as a set of assumptions about adult education rather
32

than as theory. This early concept of andragogy placed it in contrast to pedagogy.
However, Knowles himself has explained that his conceptualization of andragogy should
be viewed as a set of assumptions that must be recognized as flexible, as must be our
understanding of which and in what circumstances individuals should be considered adult
learners. Age has proven to be an illogical factor for determining whether a learner is an
adult learner or not. While one individual may demonstrate great maturity and experience
at a very young age, another may be quite naïve and sheltered despite being older.
Similarly, andragogical theory has come to recognize that the assumptions of andragogy
may be met and should be understood on a spectrum for each learner. That is, while some
adult learners may be completely autonomous and self-motivated, others may need some
external motivation and present as less autonomous and yet still be considered adult
learners.
Despite these criticisms, there is little doubt that the concepts of andragogy are
applicable to varying degrees to the mature learner as an individual. Merriam (2001)
supports Knowles’ postulation of a continuum along the andragogy and pedagogy
spectrum suggesting that exclusivity, that is identifying any individual as solely teachable
through andragogic or pedagogic methods is invalid and inappropriate. A key concept of
andragogy that may allow for this spectrum to exist is the focus on enabling rather than
providing learning. Pew argues that a purely pedagogical model could dilute learning in
higher education by restricting students in motivation, direction, experience, and
discovery (2007). Halx (2010) similarly suggests students could benefit from higher
33

education instruction designs that take into account increasing levels of student maturity.
Similarly it is crucial to recognize that an increasingly technology literate generation of
higher education students necessitates academic librarians are aware of the variety and
multitude of information-seeking experiences which will inform students in research and
information education endeavors.
Andragogy models and instruments. One of the most lauded aspects of
andragogy in publication and practice has been its open formulae allowing it to be used
as a flexible framework for adult learning and instruction. In 1984, Knowles described
multiple suppositions regarding andragogy after studying 36 applications of model.
Among these was his conclusion that:
The andragogical model is a system of elements that can be adopted or adapted in
whole or in part. It is not an ideology that must be applied totally and without
modification. In fact, an essential feature of andragogy is flexibility. (Knowles,
1984, p. 418)
Andragogical models in education and instruction. It is this feature of andragogy
which has made it applicable to so many settings, situations, and uses in adult learning
theory and practice. Holton, Swanson, and Naquin (2001) build upon foundational
andragogy to develop a practical model which identifies three dimensions of andragogy
in practice as “1) Goals and Purpose for Learning, 2) Individual and Situation
Differences, and 3) Andragogy: Core Adult Learning principles” (p. 129). This model
addresses the inherent differences between various situations and purposes for which
34

instruction of the adult learner must be tailored, and suggests andragogy is an effective
theoretical structure within which specific needs and goals can be addressed. In addition,
Holton, Swanson, and Naquin state that the principles of andragogy should be used a
guides rather than a ridged structure which must be met in full and to the same extent in
every circumstance. For example, when addressing an extremely complex subject, the
adult learner should not be held to strict self-directed learning; however, when addressing
more simple subject matter, self-directed learning should be encouraged by the instructor
(2001).
In a separate model developed to address the needs of adult learners in distance
education, Burge (1988) used the foundation of andragogy to develop a plan of praxis
focusing on learner needs. This model places the needs of the learner above those of the
instructor or indeed the content to be learned. A four pronged guideline for facilitators
focuses on responsibility, relevance, relationships, and rewards and is designed to address
the characteristics of adult learners as described by andragogy. With regard to
relationships specifically, Burge describes three- interpersonal, those developed through
cognition and affect, and the relative and contextual nature of higher order thinking
(1988). This model places the instructor firmly in a role of guide or as the model
describes facilitator. The characteristics of the adult learner are recognized and indeed
celebrated but the function of the facilitator is, at the term suggests, to facilitate
discovery, learning, and understanding.

35

Instruments to measure the success and effectiveness of andragogical
instruction. A major critique of andragogy stems from the slow and limited development
of instruments which may be used to accurately measure the effect of the andragogical
model in instruction. Its nature as a framework of assumptions rather than an empirically
tested theory has resulted in critics arguing against andragogy’s legitimacy as a model in
adult learning theory. In a review of efforts to develop tools to measure andragogy,
Holton III, Wilson, and Bates (2009) describe how early instruments were designed to
explore effectiveness of instructors’ approaches and perceptions of students. Among the
instruments they identified, three addressed andragogy solely. First, in 1981, Suanmali
developed the Andragogy Practice Inventory to measure instructors’ agreement of the
importance of the various aspects of andragogy. However, this tool did not measure
practical effectiveness. Then in 1987, Knowles developed the Personal Human Resource
Development (HRD) Style as a means of helping instructors measure their own
inclinations and orientation towards andragogical teaching style. And in 2000, Perrin
developed an instrument to measure student perceptions of effectiveness and preference
for the use of andragogical principles by instructors (Holton III et al., 2009).
In view of previous attempts, Holton III, Wilson, and Bates (2009) developed a
much more comprehensive instrument which was designed and tested to effectively
measure practical implementation of andragogical principles in instruction. Though the
tool was not able to comprehensively address andragogy, five of the six assumptions and
six of seven design processes were found to be accurately measured. While efforts must
36

still continue to create a comprehensive tool, developments in this area of andragogy
study increasingly provide validation of andragogy as an important and valid framework
within adult learning theory which can successfully be measured.
Andragogy in Academic Libraries
The need to conduct research, complete course-based or assigned projects, and the
desire to become information literate are likely to manifest among students who to
varying degrees are self-motivated, develop information needs based on immediate
necessity and life roles, have experiences upon which understanding can be based,
develop independent information needs, and in many cases direct their own learning. As
instructors in higher education and supporters of these higher education student needs,
academic librarians would likely benefit from the use of andragogical instruction theory
and practice in their instruction duties. Gold (2005) found that traditionally library
instruction is not developed to meet the needs of adult learners. Following a review of 35
years of literature covering adult education and library science, Cooke (2010) expresses
concern that adult learns can be overlooked in traditional academic library services, but
that focusing library instruction on the learner, instructor, experience, content,
technology, and the dynamic as a whole can provide a more effective learning experience
for the mature student. Ingram (2001) similarly argues that adapting andragogical
practices will make the academic librarian more approachable to higher education
students, which in turn may diminish library anxiety and raise self-actualized learning.
Malik (2016) conducted a case study which sought to determine if practicing academic
37

librarians would feel better equipped to work with graduate students if they had some
knowledge and training in adult learning theory (ALT). Interestingly, the results indicated
that many academic librarians were already incorporating elements of ALT into their
professional work though they did not necessarily recognize this as elements of a formal
theory. Additionally, once exposed to the theories and practices, most librarians
expressed a belief that ALT would be applicable to populations outside of graduate
students, including faculty, staff, and undergraduates.
Recognizing the changing education needs of higher education students has been
well addressed in education research. The extant research, in turn, resoundingly indicates
that higher education students often possess the traits of an adult learner and can benefit
highly from the implementation of adult education theory, such as andragogy. It is then a
logical assumption that academic library instruction would see success in the use of
andragogical methods. However, the research exploring how academic librarians address
and implement adult learning and instruction fails to address how academic librarians are
expected to develop these skills. It is important that academic librarians should be
prepared to provide instruction which reflects education theory, including andragogical
learning theory and instruction technique. Therefore, it is important that the LIS
preparation of academic library instructors includes the development of adult education
skills and theory.

38

CHAPTER III
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The overarching purpose of this study was to develop an informed picture of how
and to what extent accredited library and information science (LIS) programs in the US
offer opportunities for students to formally develop knowledge, skills, and experience
relevant to providing successful library and information literacy instruction to mature
learners in academic library settings. In order to achieve this, the study explored existing
LIS programs and their courses for evidence of current coverage of the practices and
theories related to adult learning and instruction. The research questions framing this
study are: 1) How prevalently are courses which focus on library instruction for
academic librarians available to students in accredited LIS schools in the US? and 2) To
what extent do library instruction for academic librarians courses in US LIS programs
address adult learning education theories and techniques within the scope of information
literacy instruction?
The present research explored current LIS programs in the US to determine how
they prepare academic librarians for professional roles as library instructors in order to
develop an understanding of whether or not current practices 1) make courses available
which directly address library instruction in higher education environments in an
adequate ratio to academic librarian students seeking formal instruction in this area, and
39

2) provide students with theoretical and practical skills specifically for instructing mature
learners. The findings of this research can then be used to inform LIS programs on future
avenues of development of library instruction education for academic librarians. By
continuing to review current practices and compare programs to professional duties and
perceived needs, LIS programs can be adapted to prepare graduates to excel in academic
library settings.
Careful planning and execution of research would result in a study which not only
informs LIS programs, but which could be replicated by future researchers to develop a
longitudinal review of the state of academic library instruction in LIS programs.
Similarly, the validity of the current study’s findings and suggestions, it is hoped, will be
supported by future iterations of the present study design and evidence of increased
program satisfaction and effectiveness resulting from implementation of the study’s
suggestions. The research design, will then, be developed and carried out with as much
transparency of process and meaning as possible.
Postulations
The proposed research has collected and analyzed data with the goal of
determining whether or not LIS programs in the US are providing opportunities for
academic library students to prepare for the professional challenges of library instruction
of mature learners. The study was designed in order to test the following two
postulations:

40

Postulation I: LIS students in the US have the opportunity to undertake
coursework preparing them to provide library instruction in an academic library setting.
Postulation II: US LIS courses in academic library instruction address the specific
needs of mature learners as part of preparing students to provide library instruction.
Population of Interest
The population of study was identified as LIS programs in the US accredited by
the American Library Association (ALA). This population was judged to be appropriate
because it is comprised of institutions of professional education of librarians in the US
within higher education which are reviewed and sanctioned by the nationally
acknowledged accrediting body. Schools within the population offer a master’s degree in
library or information science, and must undergo approval and review by the ALA
accrediting body to earn and maintain accredited status. As of winter 2015, 50
institutions in the US maintain full or conditional accreditation with the ALA (Nൌ 50)
(ALA, 2014). Because the population was relatively small and the research aims to
identify elements of courses offered in all accredited programs, each individual program
was explored and courses in information literacy identified and studied.
Unit of Analysis. The unit of analysis for the research was identified as the LIS
course. It was expected that some institutions would have more than one course which
falls within the parameters of the study and that some courses would be taught by more
than one instructor at the same institution. The research sample, if each institution has at

41

least one course which falls into the scope of the inclusion criteria, was thus predicted to
be݊ ൒ 50.
To identify these units, the researcher examined the courses offered at each of the
population LIS programs to identify courses focusing on information literacy, library
instruction, and academic librarianship. While courses with a general information literacy
or library instruction focus were included, those specifically focused on school
librarianship were not included as their topic contradicts the area of focus for the study.
Courses were excluded from the study if they are listed in the program catalog but have
not been offered within the three years prior to and inclusive of the execution of the study
(2013 to 2015). Please see Appendix A for a list of the course titles included in the
population.
Methodology
In order to answer the research questions, 1) How prevalently are courses which
focus on library instruction for academic librarians available to students in accredited
LIS schools in the US? and 2) To what extent do library instruction for academic
librarians courses in US LIS programs address adult learning education theories and
techniques within the scope of information literacy instruction?, this study utilized a
quantitative content analysis design. The research used content analysis of course syllabi
documents to examine the availability of library instruction education for academic
librarians in the US, and examined the extent to which adult learning and instruction
theories and techniques are or are not addressed in these courses. As process, content
42

analysis results in qualitative data which can then be analyzed using qualitative methods.
However, the qualitative data of a content analysis study can also be quantified so that
statistical analysis can be used. There are benefits to both qualitative and quantitative
analysis of content analysis data. While qualitative data provide descriptive
understanding, quantitative data help to make the analysis results more generalizable and
more easily and directly compared to existing and future replication studies. The goals of
the present study to identify proportions and statistically significant relationships among
course syllabi elements lend themselves to quantitative analysis. The resultant data better
enable the findings to be compared to existing, and future, studies of similar nature and/or
purpose.
Methodology Literature Review
The extant research demonstrated a distinct precedence for research in course
offerings and skill source acquisition. Among the extant research focusing solely on the
availability of course offerings, content analysis was almost exclusively used. Content
analysis methodology seeks to understand information by analyzing communication
within the specific context of meaning appropriated by the creator or creators. In this
way, the information is understood as having a culturally intoned meaning for both
creator and receiver, as well as inherent symbolic meaning itself. Content analysis can be
conducted as qualitative or quantitative research, and through systematic conduct
provides a rich description of communication. When conducted skillfully, content
analysis allows for replicable and legitimate inferences from data and is therefore a
43

highly useful technique for studying course content and curricula through the analysis of
course and program documents (Bailey, 2010; Krippendorff, 2012; Marsh & White,
2006; Rourke & Anderson, 2004).
Among the extant research, analysis of publicly available websites providing
course information was the most common method of research (Albrecht & Baron, 2002;
Bailey, 2010; Edwards, 2009; Ishimura & Bartlett, 2009; Julien, 2005b; Mbabu, 2009;
Pappert, 2005; Simmons & Corrall, 2010; Sproles et al., 2008). More in-depth research
has included review of course syllabi and calendars obtained either from school or
program web pages or through direct solicitation of the material from course instructors
or schools. Though this method is reliable when clear standards for analysis coding are
used and document analysis is proven to be congruent, it can be limited. The availability
of information from publicly available web pages and response rates necessarily limit the
research as documentation cannot be known to be complete or completely current.
However, content analysis is effective for curriculum research as course documents are a
reliable source of course content and topic information.
In addition to content analysis, quantitative surveys have been heavily used to
establish a picture of the sources from which LIS graduates and practicing academic
librarians learned their instruction skills. The extant research of LIS curricula and
academic library instruction education has also, but less frequently, made use of
interviews and qualitative questionnaire. However, in each study which utilized any of
the less common methods the purpose of the study was broader than understanding
44

availability or preference. The breakdown of study methodologies is demonstrated in

In addition to the methodologies identified from extant research of actual course
offerings, the research design of the present study was informed by Grigas’s (2013)
review of the methodologies used to examine the preparation of librarians as educators.
The Grigas report focused on three Lithuanian institutions of higher education to
determine the best method for assessing a program’s ability to prepare library educators
to the Standards for Proficiencies for Library Instructors and Coordinators, and in it
Grigas thoroughly examines library educator training research. Grigas concludes that
quantitative content analysis is appropriate for the study of LIS course content as it
allows the research questions to be addressed without introducing an intermediary, such
as instructor/librarians’ or students’ perceptions or opinions, and because results are
drawn directly from content (2013).
Content Analysis Methodology
The benefits of content analysis, however, stem from qualities which make it
critical that the researcher ensures the use of well-defined and closely followed coding or
interpretation protocol to support the veracity of the study results. By collecting content
analysis data from US LIS programs, the researcher had the opportunity to compare
trends in course coverage and content directly. The availability of content addressing the
needs of mature learners was compared to the availability of instruction training for
academic librarians. Through this direct comparison, areas of success and potential
improvement could be identified.

46

Content analysis afforded the opportunity to make valid and replicable inferences
about communication in order to identify trends, differences, and meanings within the
context of the communication used. In addition, content analysis presented an
exceptionally low impact method of research by examining the communication directly
as it was published (Krippendorff, 2012). The purpose of analysis was to a) identify
courses which focus on instruction training for academic librarians, b) identify the
presence of adult learning techniques and theories present in courses providing
instruction education for academic librarians. The data gathered was then examined and
analyzed to ascertain the extent to which academic librarians do or do not have the
opportunity to engage in formal education for library instruction, and to what extent adult
learning theories and techniques for information literacy instruction are addressed in LIS
formal education courses.
In order to address the research questions this study analyzed course documents,
namely course syllabi, which were designed to identify course objectives and content.
Studying these course documents allowed the researcher to understand the specific goals
or purpose of courses, and to explore if LIS programs addressed elements of adult
learning in preparing students for library instruction.
Content analysis of course syllabi allowed for a direct understanding of the intent,
purpose, and coverage of courses preparing future academic librarians for their roles as
instructors. Similarly, elements of adult learning were potentially difficult to identify
using simple key word indexing because the principles of adult learning can be addressed
47

in a myriad of concepts, terms, or phrases. However, the proposed research goal was
addressed through the use of assumptions about information literacy instruction for the
adult learner.
Though the extant literature clearly demonstrates library instruction courses are
available for LIS students in formal education in the US, there remain several questions
vital to a full understanding of the presence and effect of these courses for preparing
academic librarians to teach mature students. With the exception of Julien and Genius
(2011), Simmons and Carroll (2010), Ishimura and Bartlett (2009), and Pappert (2005),
the existing research has ignored the difference between formal preparation for library
instruction of academic librarians and school librarians or school media specialists. Due
to the difference in learning and research needs between academic and school library
users, it was reasonable to infer that the instruction skills and knowledge of representative
librarians would also differ. New research was needed to explore the availability of
courses with a specific focus on those available to and specifically designed for academic
librarians and to determine if these courses addressed the subject of adult learning and
adult education. It is possible that by exploring whether or not the specific needs of
mature learners were addressed in LIS preparation for academic library instruction, the
proposed research may determine a deficit in courses preparing academic librarians for
what is often an increasingly important aspect of their professional duties.
In exploring the availability of library instruction education for academic
librarians it was important not only to determine the extent to which LIS courses have
48

been offered, but also what subjects and learning objectives of the courses specifically
addressed concepts, practical training, and ideas directly relevant to the instruction of
mature learners. Therefore, this research sought to examine existing library instruction
courses for academic librarians to identify content specific to adult education techniques
and adult theory represented by the principles of andragogy.
Assumptions Underlying the Research
In order to determine how library instruction specifically addresses adult learners,
it was necessary to identify a set of assumptions which combine existing information
literacy competencies and principles of adult education. While library instruction courses
may cover a variety of topics, the common task of library instructors to assist students in
the development of information literacy competence has meant library instruction courses
should seek to provide students with the skills necessary to aid specifically in the
instruction and guidance of developing information literate students.
There are multiple professional models designed to address the various elements
or traits related to the individual’s information literacy. Some of the most well-known
and often used of these include the Association of College and Research Library’s
(ACRL) Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (2000), the Chartered
Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) Information Literacy model
(2013), the Society of College, National and University Libraries’ (SCONUL) Seven
Pillars of Information Literacy (2011), Standards for the 21st-Century Learner from the
American Association of School Librarians (AASL, 2007), and the International
49

Federation of Library Associations and Institutions’ Guidelines on Information Literacy
for Lifelong Learning (Lau, 2006). Though each model, definition, or standard varies in
exact wording and presentations, they all share the same purpose, to provide a coherent
outline or definition of what qualities and skills should be able to be demonstrated by an
individual in order to consider that person information literate. Each of the above models
contains similar elements, including understanding and communicating information
needs, locating and evaluating information, and using and communicating information to
a specific purpose ethically and responsibly.
While multiple standard or definitions could be used in conjunction, research and
practical uses commonly focus on the model or set of standards published or supported
by the professional body most directly concerned with their institution charter, population
of service, or mission. Therefore, the present study has used ACRL’s Information
Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ILCSHE) as its foundational
standards for information literacy skills. Because the present study is concerned with how
academic librarians aid adult students, it was prudent to recognize information literacy
competence within the scope of adult learners’ specific needs. However, no specific set
of information literacy standards specifically addressed the traits of an adult learner.
Research into adult learning in libraries instead has relied on the extant research,
knowledge, and traits addressed by adult learning theories without integrating traits and
standards of IL. As discussed in the literature review, Malcolm Knowles’ assumptions
about adult learning which make up andragogy have been a prevalent and widely
50

acknowledged foundational premise in adult learning theory. Knowles’ assumptions have
a comprehensive scope and simple structure which has been advantageous for use as a
rubric in research seeking to understand development and implementation of successful
instruction for adults.
In order to explore the development of professional training to address the
specific needs of adult learners in library instruction, which focuses heavily on
information literacy, it was necessary to develop a set of assumptions which address the
particular characteristics of the information literate adult learner. This set of five
assumptions was developed by the researcher by integrating the Association of College
and Research Libraries’ Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education (ILCSHE) and Knowles’ six assumptions about the nature of the adult learner.
In order to achieve an integration which was logical and applicable to adult
library users, the researcher examined both the standards and assumptions to identify
areas of similarity. For example, the first ILCSHE and first of Knowles’ principles
address information need. Using this shared node, the researcher inspected how the two
could be merged. In this case, the information literacy component addressed the
evaluation of the need and the andragogical principle addressed the source of the need.
As a result, the first assumption of adult learning concerns evaluating the benefit of new
information to meet the individual’s information need. The autonomous nature of adult
learners information need has been reflected in the unique evaluation of information’s
value to the individual. Similarly, Knowles’ sixth principle addresses the internal
51

motivation of adult learners. Internal motivation to learn loaned itself to the incorporation
of ILCSHE standards three and five which address the intelligent, ethical, and purposeful
use of information. The integration of these standards and principle resulted in the fifth
assumption of adult learners which reflected the internal motivation that drives the adult
library user to continue to build her knowledge base. Because information need comes
from the adult library user’s internal need, it is in her interest to integrate the new
information with existing knowledge and utilize the new information responsibly.
All five assumptions of adult learning were developed using the same format of
combining the ILCSHE and Knowles’ principles of andragogy for the adult library user
with a view to identify measureable elements of information literacy (IL) instruction
tailored to the specific needs of the adult learner. The resulting set of assumptions about
the information literate adult learner were used to examine library instruction courses for
academic librarians in US LIS programs to determine if the courses addressed the unique
needs of the adult learner. Figure 1 below gives the five assumptions of adult learning
and details the specific combination of standards and principles used to develop each.

52

53

In the current research, the five assumptions about information literate adult
learners have been used to analyze library instruction courses for elements specifically
preparing academic library instructors to work with adult learners and their unique
learning characteristics to aid in the development of information literacy competence.
Identifying the presence or lack of evidence that these assumptions were being addressed
by LIS academic library instruction courses will allow the research to identify how LIS
courses are preparing academic library instructors to provide effective instruction, and
potentially make suggestions on ways these courses could be improved by increasing or
adding elements addressing the assumptions about information literate adult learners.
By examining how academic librarians have been being prepared to teach
information literacy to mature students in higher education programs in the US, this
research proposed to develop a distinct picture of the current status of library instruction
education for academic librarians in LIS. From this developed understanding, we will
then be able to determine if LIS programs are keeping up with current needs of academic
librarians by preparing them for their professional careers as nontraditional educators.
Suggestions can then be made on how further development of courses addressing adult
education could proceed to continue to empower academic librarians in the workplace.
The limits of this type of research relate to availability of documents and coder
reliability. Though previous research has demonstrated many course syllabi have been
available online, the consistency of document availability and the syllabi content does
vary between institution and course instructor. However, previous studies have indicated
54

the participation of course instructors in the provision of syllabi for research could be
expected to be of a level to allow valid findings and discussion (Ishimura & Bartlett,
2009; Saunders, 2015a; Sproles, Johnson, & Farison, 2008).
The following chapter, Data Collection and Analysis, will discuss the processes
undertaken to identify, gather, and interpret the data in order to address the research
questions using the methodology described above.

55

CHAPTER IV
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
Data Collection
In order to address the research questions and answer the postulations put forth in
this research, data representing library and information science (LIS) courses was
collected and examined. Among the population of institutions offering American Library
Association (ALA) accredited LIS programs (N=50) it was necessary to identify a
reliable source of data which could demonstrate the existence of adult learning theory in
LIS courses. This data source needed to be representative of course offerings, exist across
all population programs, and be able to be collected by the researcher. The logical unit of
analysis was thus identified as course, which were in turn examined using course syllabi.
For the purposes of this study, course syllabi are defined as the document or set of
documents named or presented by the instructor or LIS program as or in the role of the
official course syllabus. The syllabus may contain course policies, description, instructor
comments, calendars, schedules, descriptions of course components such as assignments
or projects, contact information, rules, expectations, readings, and other course related
information. Though the population was known to be the number of ALA-accredited
institutions, the number of courses and thus syllabi relevant to the study were unknown at
the outset. It was expected that some institutions would have more than one course which
fell within the parameters of the study and that some courses would be taught by more
56

than one instructor at the same institution. The research sample, if each institution had at
least one course which fell into the scope of the inclusion criteria, was thus predicted to
be݊ ൒ 50.
Parameters of the Study
Courses from which syllabi were collected were required to meet specific criteria
in order to be included in this study. Parameters were set to define the sample eligible and
relevant to the research questions. First, only courses which focused on or whose topic
was library instruction or academic librarianship would be included. These courses could
have titles or descriptions related to instruction, information literacy, user services,
academic, research, or college libraries; this list however, was not exhaustive. The
researcher used published course titles and official descriptions to identify courses whose
syllabi could be included in the sample population. However, courses focused entirely on
library instruction in K12 settings were excluded from the study because by definition
they would not be expected to address instruction or learning for adults. It was important
to the purpose of this study to identify courses which were available to the average LIS
student. Because many LIS programs operate on a course rota, it was critical to provide a
window large enough to encompass potential offerings. However, because many LIS
students spend between two and three years completing their degree, the window needed
to be limited enough to support reasoning that as many students as possible have the
opportunity to take the course during the duration of their LIS program. Therefore, the
second parameter was that only courses offered from spring 2013 to fall 2015 were to be
57

included. This created a three-year window of time in which a course could be offered.
The third and final parameter stated that only courses available to Master of Library
Science (MLS) seeking students were included. This excludes course exclusively for
undergraduate or doctoral students. Using these constraints, the process of developing the
sample was ready to commence.
Sample Population
The first step to collecting syllabi documents was to develop a sample pool
database of relevant courses based on the information published by LIS programs on their
own and their institutions’ websites. The researcher reviewed LIS program, school, and
institution websites to identify course listings and official course descriptions. This
information was found in course catalogues, graduate catalogues, course offering lists,
course rotation schedules, and other official course descriptions. In the case that the
description or course title represented any of the areas of interest for this study (i.e.
instruction, academic librarianship, information literacy, etc.) the course was considered
relevant to the study and the course’s information was recorded in the sample pool
database. This information included course title, course number, and institution. This
provided the study with an initial group of courses for which syllabi could potentially be
collected. The researcher recognized that the course descriptions available publicly online
may not have been complete. Therefore, this list was considered working rather than
complete. A full list of courses included in the sample can be found in Appendix A.

58

The second step to collecting the syllabi for the relevant course was to identify
instructor and LIS program contacts from whom copies of the syllabi would be requested.
Again, the research used published online information from course offering lists, class
searchers, registration lists, and program information within the three year timeframe to
identify instructors for courses listed in the sample pool. The instructors’ names and
emails were then listed in the record representing the course they taught. In the event that
more than one instructor was listed for a course, a new record was created for the course
for each instructor. While the list of instructors was extensive the researcher recognizes
that variances in published and up to date course information meant it was likely not
complete. To develop as wide a group of contacts as possible, the researcher then used
institution and LIS program faculty profiles to identify faculty members whose research
and teaching interests intersected with the topics relevant to this study. The names and
email addresses of these individuals were recorded in the sample pool database as new
records, giving their topic of interest rather than a course number. Finally, for programs
where no specific instructor was identified, the researcher examined the program website
for contact information for the department head or chair. This department representative
was recorded in the sample pool database in a unique record with the word “Admin” in
the course field and the individual’s title rather than course number. Thus, the sample
pool database then contained information on courses of interest and as complete as
possible a list of contacts from whom syllabi would be requested.

59

Sample data pool. The resulting sample pool database included 190 individual
records. Each record contained a unique representation of a specific course, individual, or
a combination of these two elements. This total represented 167 inimitable individuals
and 101 distinct courses to be used in the data collection process. This created a
provisional sample population of at least 101 syllabi to be collected. Each record was
given a researcher-assigned sample pool database catalogue number made up of a twodigit prefix to identify institution and a two-digit suffix to identify individual and/or
course. These catalogue numbers were used throughout the data collection and analysis
process to track and analyse communication and sample documents. A review of the
sample pool database indicated that in a 100% return rate sample, instances would have
occurred in which a single course was taught by more than one professor or in more than
one term. Because each version or offering of a course may be different than others, it
was necessary to consider all viable syllabi from courses meeting the parameters set
forth. Therefore partially repeated syllabi have been included in the study unless multiple
iterations showed no change from the other. In such a case, only the most recent of the
identical syllabi was included.
Data Collection Methods
The process of data collection was undertaken using two methods, direct appeal
and online search. By using both methods, the researcher hoped to develop as broad a
sample as possible. Direct appeal provided the benefit of communicating directly with the
individuals responsible for the creation and employment of the syllabi. Online search
60

benefited the study by accessing publicly available information and not relying on
responses from individuals. Additionally, by supporting direct appeal with online search,
and vice versa, the potential sample bias is lessened because the study did not rely solely
on voluntary response or self-reported publications by LIS programs.
Direct appeal for participation. The process of direct appeal was relatively
straightforward with the help of the sample pool database. Email was determined to be
the best method of communication for several reasons. First, email could easily and at
almost no cost reach any number of individuals. Second, email could be used as an
asynchronous form of communication. This allowed the respondents the option to reply
when it is convenient for them. Because the vast majority of the individuals contacted
were LIS faculty who have exceptionally busy schedules and often face a high volume of
communication, this benefit was highly desirable. Third, because the researcher was
based outside of the US during the data collection process, it was critical to use a system
of communication where time zone difference would not impact the sample results.
Finally, email provided respondents with a cost free method of sharing their syllabi with
the researcher. Again, because of the researcher’s location, this was critical to a
successful sampling.
Using a standard word processor, a draft letter was developed which could be
pasted into an email once ready. The purpose of the letter was to introduce the research
and request participation via the sharing of syllabi. The letter included the researcher’s
identification, contact, and affiliation information as well as contact information for
61

dissertation supervisor. A brief description of the research purpose was provided and a
request was made for the most recent copy of syllabi for any courses related to
instruction, academic librarianship, information literacy, or concerned with adult
learning. Potential participants were assured that any syllabi would be used solely for the
purpose of this study and data security protocols would be followed. The researcher
offered to discuss further or answer any questions and concluded the communication. The
email was less than one Word page document in length to ensure both adequate coverage
and brevity. The letter was finalized and formatting removed to provide a seamless
copying process. See Appendix B for a copy of this letter.
A final list of contacts was created using the sorting functions of the sample pool
database. Records without contact information and records with repeated individuals
were identified and appropriately removed from the set. This final set, composed of all
those to be emailed the request for participation was then copied into a spreadsheet. An
email draft was created using the researcher’s university email account. The content of
the finalized letter requesting participation was pasted into the body of the email and
reviewed for possible formatting issues. The list of contact emails was then pasted into
the blind carbon copy (BCC) field of the composition email. The BCC addressee function
was used to ensure each individual to receive the email did so anonymously to other
recipients. The primary recipient (To) was given as the researcher. After all fields had
been carefully checked the email was sent.

62

The participation request email was sent on 6 October 2015. This request was
emailed to a total of 129 unique individuals. Responses were received from 6 October
until 3 November. In total 31 respondents replied. Some responses were courtesy replies
to indicate that the individual did not teach a course relevant to the study. Others
indicated that while they did not have a syllabus to share they had forwarded the
participation request to fellow faculty. As a result of the first appeal, 26 unique syllabi
were collected. Each response and receipt of syllabi was recorded in the sample pool
database.
A second request email was drafted using the information from the first, this time
including acknowledgement of the first request and a second appeal. A copy of this email
is provided in Appendix C. Using the sample pool database, a list of the individuals who
had not replied to the first request was created. Just over six weeks after the initial
request, on 18 November 2015, the follow up email was sent to the individuals on that
list. An additional 13 responses were obtained including 11 unique syllabi. These were
similarly recorded in the sample pool database for future reference.
In total, 44 responses were received from the pool of 129. The response rate of
34.1% is relatively low. However, because the potential sample was expanded to include
instructors who were not officially listed as teaching a relevant course, it was considered
adequate. A more telling figure was the relative receipt rate among the pool of syllabi. In
total 37 syllabi were collected from direct request to LIS faculty and instructors. Of these,
33 unique courses were represented. Among these courses were four which had not been
63

identified in the sample pool. These courses were added to the sample pool database
bringing the total population of relevant courses to 104. Therefore, the syllabi collected
via participation request represented just under one-third (31.7%) of the identified
population of courses.
Online search for relevant data sources. Online search was used as a second
data collection method to supplement the direct request. The process of conducting the
online search was put forward in a brief set of protocols. First the researcher visited each
institutions’ website and searched for the courses listed in the sample pool database.
Searching was comprised of visiting the program site and making visual investigation of
various elements and pages to determine if and where syllabi were published. In addition,
the institution’s website search function was employed. Search parameters included the
distinct course number assigned to each course by its parent institution, e.g. LIS5572.
The second method of online search utilized Google Search. Using the same identifying
course numbers, course titles, and if necessary institution name, the researcher sought
syllabi published on institution websites and also the non-institution websites of faculty.
Searches were conducted for all 104 courses listed in the sample pool database. Because
the research did not limit representation of each course to a single syllabus, it was
deemed important to seek out any syllabi available. Successful searches were recorded
therein and the syllabus retained. As a result of the online search, an additional 36 unique
syllabi were identified as relevant and eligible to the study. Among these were syllabi for

64

34 unique courses from the sample pool which represent an additional 32.7% of the
identified population of courses.
Data Set
All non-redundant syllabi meeting the course topic and timeframe parameters
collected were included in the study data set. By combining the results of the direct
request and online search, a total sample of 73 syllabi was collected. These syllabi
represented 67 unique courses in the sample pool. Though the response rate was modest
from the direct request participants at 34.1% (44 of 129), the additional data collection
via online search meant that this figure belies the true success of developing the sample.
Considering 67 of the 104 courses identified in the sample pool were represented the in
the study sample, a more accurate figure for the sample shows it represented 64.4% of the
sample pool population. This represented a statistically adequate proportion of the
population to conduct statistical tests and analysis.
Data Analysis
Following the relative success in collecting the data sources, the next process was
to extract relevant data from the obtained syllabi and analyze it in order to address the
study questions. The method of data development, or extraction, used was content
analysis. Content analysis was appropriate to the document data sources in this study as
they contained information that could be extricated and understood on its own with
consideration to how it fit into the whole. Purposive content analysis has been a preferred
method of research when examining course content and coverage via syllabi as it allows
65

the researcher too examine course objectives and content within the context of the course
document. Additionally, and crucially, content analysis provides a means of converting
the descriptive information in the syllabi into quantifiable data which can be statistically
analyzed (Krippendorff, 2012).
Data Coding
Content analysis required the analysed documents be coded using a proscribed
research protocol. This protocol was developed to address the research question, to
provide regularity to the coding process, and provide a detailed map to ensure the
replicability of the research. However, prior to the coding process, the documents had to
be prepared and organized. Each syllabus was printed and labelled using the unique
identifier number assigned in the sample pool database. Each syllabus was then placed in
its own clear plastic document protector and placed in sequential order of identification
number in one of three binders. Once completed, these binders became the physical data
set, allowing the researcher easy access and organization of the documents in preparation
for coding.
Coding rules. The coding standards set forth in the research protocol meant that
the syllabi was coded using established codes representing the assumptions of adult
learning (AAL) developed by the researcher for this study and a grounded coding
approach towards additional elements of syllabi content which were of interest or impact
to the study. The AALs state the five premises representing the traits of an adult learner.

The following table (Table 4.1) depicts the set of codes developed to document the
existence of AAL elements in the data set.

Using this established protocol and a grounded coding approach to identify additional
elements, each syllabus was individually read and coded by the researcher. The actual
process of coding followed a methodical plan which helped to ensure complete and
accurate coding.
Initial coding. In the initial coding pass, each document was read individually
and relevant information was marked directly on the printed syllabus. Items that met any
of the five AAL codes were underlined and the relevant code noted. Other elements of
interest, such as assignments, common content, and topics were underlined so that they
could be further examined. Each document was then reviewed and the noted information
was recorded in a coding spreadsheet. The coding spreadsheet was created to provide an
organized and consistent method to record and track information identified in each
syllabus. Using the unique identifier number, each syllabus was listed along with the
noted excerpts from the syllabus. These excerpts were grouped into provisional codes and
recorded. There was no limit placed on how many or how few pieces of information
could be recorded for coding from any document. In some instances, over 30 pieces of
information were marked and recorded, and in others there were no pieces of information
68

in the syllabus other than its title which could be coded. Each excerpt of information
could be assigned to only one code. However, an excerpt could be one word or multiple
sentences. All of the excerpts were examined and coalescing codes were created for the
relevant non-AAL content. These included codes such as “user needs” or “general
learning theory” which were determined to be topics of interest to the study though they
did not fall within the purview of one of the AAL codes. In total, 20 trends were
identified and respective codes were created, with two categories each having a single
subcategory, and another having two subcategories. Additionally, the documents were
given a code 0-2 based on course type, to help identify trends based on the course topic.
There were, therefore, a total of 25 possible designations for each piece of information
identified in the syllabi. See Appendix D for the list of codes and their corresponding
definitions. The coding spreadsheet was then carefully reviewed to ensure that
appropriate excerpts were aligned with their given codes.
Verification coding. In order to ensure the veracity of the initial results, the
process of coding was undertaken a second time. In this pass, the researcher again used
the AAL codes, but also used the 25 established designations to mark clean copies of
each document. These code designators consisted of a decimalized number 1 through 20
where the decimal was followed by a 0 in instances where there was no subcategory and
continuous numbers in instances where a subcategory existed. The documents were again
reviewed one at a time and relevant information was underlined, and this time marked
with the appropriate code designator. The results of this effort were then carefully
69

compared to the initial coding results using the coding spreadsheet. The few differences
were examined and reconciled to the most accurate and appropriate code. These most
often reflected the similarity between categories and subcategories. The coding
spreadsheet was updated to reflect all corrections. The final coding spreadsheet
represented a complete set of the coded data, however, this would need to be further
developed and transformed to make the information more concise and prepare it for
analysis.
Coding Rules and Categorization
Due to the nature of the research questions, the information extracted from coding
represented categorical data. In order to analyze these data statistically, they had to be
quantified. A copy was created of the original coding spreadsheet to ensure that changes
could be made without losing any of the actual information excerpts. All of the coded
information occurrences were then delineated in a straight forward yes/no binary. That is,
if a syllabus contained an excerpt for a specific code, it was give a “1” for yes. If the
syllabus did not have an excerpt for a code it was given a “0” for no. This created a
spreadsheet of representational data. The nature of the research allowed this because it
was important to note whether a code was or was not represented in a particular syllabus
rather than how many times it was represented in the syllabus. The new spreadsheet thus
compared each syllabus to each possible code. The code category “Course Type” was
coded using representational numbers to indicate whether the course, based on name and
course description, was an instruction course, an academic library course, or other. The
70

remaining 24 codes were marked using the yes/no binary distinction, 1 if the category
was represented by information in the syllabus, 0 if it was not. Upon review, frequency in
some of the categories and indeed the close relationship between some of the codes
necessitated a further refinement into categories for analysis. The 25 codes were then
arranged into 15 categories. These represented two groups in which the categories were
entirely unique. The first group represented content, elements, and assignments of interest
to the study. The second group represented the AAL codes developed purposefully for
the study. Due to the nature of each individual category, some crossover did exist
between some of the content categories and some AAL categories. However, this is
carefully noted and the comparison of these groups will be excluded from the data
analysis results. These categories can be seen in Appendix E.
Coding reliability. In order to validate codes used and developed by the
researcher, a test for reliability was conducted. In this test, an outside coder was given
two sample syllabi and a copy of the code categories and their definition. The outside
coder has a background in education so possessed the content and theoretical knowledge
relevant to the data. The interrater reliability resulted in an initial 90% agreement. The
sole instance where the coders did not agree resulted from the second coder questioning
which of two codes was most appropriate. This was reviewed and both coders agreed on
the researcher’s interpretation. This independent verification gives some support to the
validity of the code used and how they were applied in this research.

71

Data excerpts from LIS course syllabi. Information coded using the 15
developed categories were identified and recorded for the purpose of identifying adult
learning theory or instruction, assumption of adult learning, and other library instruction
elements in order to address the research purpose. Examples from instruction related
content are given below. This content was used to better understand and interpret the
structure and juxtaposition of adult learning elements within LIS academic library and
instruction courses. Examples of the assumptions of adult learning and adult learning
theory and instruction are discussed in the following chapter, Findings and Discussion.
Examples of instruction related content in LIS syllabi. Two of the more
common instruction related elements identified in the instruction and academic library
courses were general learning theory and instruction methods. The commonality of these
elements is easily understood as they are foundational or basic elements to instruction
education. One example of general learning theory was that students be able to
“Articulate the various theories, from education and library and information studies, that
underpin exemplary practice in information literacy instruction.” As one of the course
learning objectives, this indicates that a primary goal of the course was to provide
students with a foundation in learning theory. Similarly, another syllabus demonstrated
the instructor’s emphasis on instructions methods in course goals which note the course
would have addressed “Key educational approaches to teaching information literacy,”
and “Best practices in information literacy inclusion programs.”

72

Compilation of coded data. All of the coded information was organized and
recorded in both excerpt fashion for references, and in numerical representation in a
spreadsheet to facilitate understanding and provide a compact overview of the entire
dataset. Additionally, the spreadsheet was prepared with purpose to be readily used in
data analysis software. The final spreadsheet was carefully reviewed for accuracy,
missing elements, and clarity to ensure the analysis process would be accurate and
successful. Each of categories’ names was formalized and syllabi identifiers were
confirmed in order to fully prepare the data for the statistical analysis software.
Quantitative Testing and Analysis
As mentioned, the data in this study represent categorical data. That is, the data
represent a descriptive characteristic rather than a quantity or numerical value. Because
categorical data do not represent numerical values, such as measures or frequencies, the
use of common parametric statistical analysis was inappropriate. Instead of measure
based statistics, categorical data analysis considers the relationship between two
variables. Unlike the more recognisable normal distribution or one-tailed distribution
used with measured data, distribution for categorical data is displayed in a contingency
table. The contingency table, in the case of this study, was comprised of two rows and
two columns. The rows and columns each represent the binary existence of a single
category. For example, in this study the columns may represent the presence of adult
learning theory and instruction elements and the non-presence of adult learning theory
compared to the presence of and non-presence of instruction methods in a syllabus. Each
73

intersection was populated by a number representing the frequency of the conditions
occurrence, the joint frequency. The joint frequencies, and their respective column and
row totals, called marginals, were used to calculate the test statistic. A sample of a
contingency table used in this study is shown in Table 4.2 below.

Fisher’s Exact Test of association. Since categorical data could not be examined
using typical inferential or descriptive statistics, we instead examined the data for
significant evidence of association, or a relationship. There are two primary statistical
tests to determine the relationship between variables. These are the chi squared test for
independence and the Fisher’s Exact test. The basic assumptions for a chi squared test are
that the data was gathered in a random sample and that no more than 20% of the joint
frequencies are less than five, and none are less than one. In this study however, the
categories identified and populations thereof mean that the data set is sparsely distributed.
As a result, the Fisher’s Exact test was used instead of the chi squared test for
independence. Fisher’s is based on the hypergeometric distribution and provides some
74

advantage as it calculates the exact probability of a more radical data set. That is, the
Fisher’s calculates the exact probability of another observed sample being more extreme
than the sample tested. Fisher’s can be used to test a hypothesis of independence. A
significant result indicates that the hypothesis of independence must be rejected, and the
alternative, that there is a relationship between the variables, accepted. The Fisher’s
Exact formula is ‫ ݌‬ൌ 

௥భ Ǩ௥మ Ǩ௖భ Ǩ௖మ Ǩ
௡Ǩ௔Ǩ௕Ǩ௖ǨௗǨ

where the statistic ‫ ݌‬represents the probability and is

compared to the established level of significance, ‫ן‬ൌ  ǤͲͷ, to determine whether or not
to reject the null hypothesis. The variables ‫ݎ‬௜ and ܿ௝ repesent the marginals, the variables
ܽ, ܾ, ܿ, and ݀ represent the joint frequencies, and ݊ is the sample population (Boslaugh,
2012).
Phi statistic for correlation. While the Fisher’s test was able to tell us whether or
not there is statistical evidence of a relationship, it did not provide any insight into the
correlation between the variables. That is, it does not tell us how strong the association is
between the variables. To determine association the statistic Phi was used to calculate
association between binary variables. The formula for Phi is ‫ ׎‬ൌ 

௔ௗି௕௖
ඥሺ௔ା௕ሻሺ௖ାௗሻሺ௔ା௖ሻሺ௕ାௗሻ

.

In a 50-50 split distribution of marginals, the range of Phi would be -1 to 1.
However, in the case presented in this study the distribution varies but was not even, so
the range of Phi was slightly smaller than that of an equal distribution. The value of Phi
gives us a reasonable indication of the strength of the relationship between the variables,
such as weak, moderate, or strong. However, it is important to note that due to the nature
of the Phi range, there can be no standard definition for what qualifies a moderate, etc.
75

(Boslaugh, 2012). Instead, the definition of association ranges were developed by the
researcher based on the observed possible range of Phi. In this study, the observed
possible range of Phi was found to be approximately -.90 to .90. The range used in this
study considered a strong association to be one which has a Phi variable representing an
association above the 60th percentile. Therefore a reasonable understanding of the Phi
values in this study can be defined by the distribution of ranges as follows: Ͳ‫݋ݐ‬ȁǤʹͷȁ ൌ
‫݈݀݅ܯ‬ǡ ȁǤʹͷͳȁ െ ȁǤͷͷȁ ൌ ‫݁ݐܽݎ݁݀݋ܯ‬ǡ ȁǤͷͷͳȁ െ ȁǤ͹Ͳȁ ൌ ‫݃݊݋ݎݐܵݕ݈ݐܽݎ݁݀݋ܯ‬ǡ ȁǤ͹ͳȁ െ
ȁǤͻͲȁ ൌ ܵ‫݃݊݋ݎݐ‬. In the case where the Phi value was positive, there was a positive
association indicating that the presence of one variable suggests to the relevant degree the
likely presence of the other. If however the Phi value was negative, there was an inverse
association suggesting that the presence of one variable suggests to the relevant degree
the unlikely presence of the other.
Using the Fisher’s Exact and Phi statistics, we examined the data collected and
identified relationships and their relative associations. These relationships provided some
understanding of how adult learning and instruction fit into LIS programs in the US.
Additionally, these statistics allowed us to address the research questions put forth in this
study directly.
Statistical Analysis of Using SPSS
In order to improve legitimacy of the calculations presented and used in this
study, the researcher employed IBM’s statistical software package SPSS version 22.0.
This software allowed the researcher to import a prepared data set and run any number of
76

potential statistical tests on the data. Using the spreadsheet prepared previously in the
data analysis process, the data were imported into SPSS from their spreadsheet file. A
codebook report and descriptive report for Frequency were generated to confirm the data
were accurately prepared, that there were no missing variables, and to provide basic
descriptive counts and percentages for the binary conditions of each variable. These were
then used to verify the data against the spreadsheet. All counts and totals were in
agreement therefore the data import into SPSS was determined to be successful.
SPSS tests. In order to test the relationship and association, the SPSS function for
analysing descriptive statistics for cross tabulation was employed. This process allowed
the researcher to select each variable and compare it individually to all other variables.
The process required the researcher to request a chi squared output with the addition of
the Phi and Cramer’s V statistics (Pallant, 2013). Additionally, percentages for rows,
columns, and totals were requested to further confirm computational accuracy.
SPSS output. The SPSS output provided the case processing summary, crosstab,
chi squared summary, and symmetric measures for each variable pair combination. The
frequency and crosstab summaries provided descriptive information on the process and
on the variables calculated. The SPSS output for the chi squared test provided six
different statistics used in various situations to measure for relationships in categorical
data. Of these six, this research was interested only in the Fisher’s Exact. Two Fisher’s
statistics are provided in the output, for a two-tailed and a single-tailed test. The relevant
statistic for this research was the Fisher’s Exact one-tailed p-value because there is no
77

possibility for negative occurrences within the categories. A significance level of ‫ן‬ൌ
ǤͲͷ has been standard with research in the educational and library science field of study
and thus was employed in the study to determine when a result could be found to be
significant. A pair of variables whose one-tailed Fisher’s statistic was less than the value
‫ ݌‬൏  ǤͲͷ was considered significant and the null postulate was rejected. The Phi value
was reported in the symmetric measures output. These values, as discussed, could
theoretically vary between -1 and 1. A Phi value of zero would mean a very weak
association while a Phi value close to the absolute value of one would mean a very strong
association.
Application of SPSS on study data. The comparison of categories through
statistical analysis was used to answer the research questions. The category adult learning
theories and instruction was thus paired with each of the remaining content categories of
user needs, general learning theory, instruction methods, teaching role, instruction
assignment, interview assignment, own philosophy, observation assignment, all
assumptions of adult learning, assumption of adult learning (AAL) 2, 3, 4, and 5. The
researcher then ran these same comparisons on the subpopulations of courses identified
as instruction and courses identified as academic library. This allowed deeper
understanding of how the type of course may affect these relationships. Additionally, the
subset of AAL categories, all and each individually, were compared to each of the other
elements allowing the researcher the opportunity to identify relationships related directly
to the AAL standards developed in this study. Finally, the content categories were
78

compared to one another to determine if any associations could be noted within the
content of the syllabi studied. Categories which had overlapping content, namely the
combined and individual assumptions of adult learning and assumption of adult learning
and user needs were not compared as the data does not meet the uniqueness requirement
for the Fisher’s Exact test.
The SPSS crosstabs test provides the user with the opportunity to quickly and
accurately perform statistical analysis of categorical data. The output is standardized and
easy to interpret and use. After running all tests, comparing each category to the others,
and performing a course-sorted comparison, the output data was printed for examination.
Using the ‫ן‬ൌ  ǤͲͷ significance level, the pairings with significant results were identified
and their p-values and Phi values were collected for further analysis and interpretation.
Results of Statistical Analysis
Using SPSS to calculate the test for Fisher’s Exact statistic, a total of 22
significant associations were identified. Among these, six included adult learning theory
and instruction and an additional four associations included assumptions of adult
learning. The remaining 12 represented relationships between other notable content and
topics addressed in the course syllabi. By exploring these associations, we were able to
address the research questions.
Adult learning theory and instruction. Adult learning theory and instruction
(ALT-I) was compared to the other content categories. ALT-I compared to user needs
resulted in a p-value of .034 and Phi of .240. This suggested a mild association where the
79

presence of ALT-I content suggests a likelihood of the presence of user needs content.
ALT-I compared to general learning theory (Gen LT) resulted in a p-value of .001 and a
Phi of .381. This similarly suggested a moderate association in which the presence of
ALT-I suggests the likelihood of Gen LT content. ALT-I compared to instruction
methods resulted in a p-value of .000 with a Phi of .394 which demonstrated a moderate
association between the two. When compared, ALT-I and own philosophy assignment
have a p-value of .047 and a Phi of .261 which showed a moderate association. ALT-I
and the fifth adult learning assumption, AAL5 resulted when compared in a p-value of
.037 and Phi of .295 also suggested a moderate association. Finally, ALT-I compared
with instruction assignments gives a p-value of .003 with a Phi of .346, again which
showed a moderate association that suggests the presence of ALT-I creates a likelihood
of presence of an instruction assignment component.
General learning theory. Three other syllabi components showed some
significant associations when compared to other component categories. General learning
theory (Gen LT) demonstrated significant association with five other categories. Gen LT
and user needs had a p-value of .008 with a Phi value of .315. This moderate association
suggested that when a syllabus contains general learning theory components it is likely to
also contain elements concerning user needs. Gen LT compared to instruction methods
and resulted in a p-value of .000 and a Phi value of .801. This indicated a strong
association in which a syllabus containing general learning theory is highly likely to also
contain components concerning instruction methods. Comparing Gen LT and instruction
80

assignments gave a p-value of .000 and Phi value of .681 again showing a strong
association and suggesting instruction assignments are linked to the presence of general
learning theory components. Gen LT when compared to the requirement to create a
personal philosophy and the requirement to complete an observation assignment resulted
in p-values of .024 and .004 with Phi values of .264 and .324 respectively. These
suggested a moderate association between general learning theory components and each
of the course requirement elements.
Instruction methods. Inclusion of instruction methods in a syllabus demonstrated
significant association with four other elements. When compared to user needs, the
requirement to create an individual philosophy of learning, and an observation
assignment were significant with p-values of .002, .020, and .021 respectively. Phi values
of .362, .272, and .265 suggested these associations are moderate. Therefore, we would
postulate that a syllabus which includes elements of instruction methods would also
include elements related to user needs, developing an individual learning philosophy, and
an observation assignment. Additionally, instruction methods and instruction assignment
components suggested a stronger moderate association with a p-value of .000 and Phi
value of .535. The Phi value reaches the top end of the moderate spectrum, thus we could
expect a slightly stronger relationship between the presence of instruction method
components and the requirement to develop a form of instruction for a course assignment.
Instruction assignment. The instruction assignment requirement has an
additional three significant associations with other component categories. A moderate
81

association existed between the instruction assignment component and user needs,
requirement to develop a learning philosophy, and the completion of an observation
assignment. P-values of .005, .030, and .000 with corresponding Phi values of .328, .265,
and .466 suggested syllabi which include an instruction assignment are moderately likely
to also contain these elements.
Assumptions of adult learning. The assumptions of adult learning (AAL) had
relatively few significant associations. However, it was curious to note where these did
exist. The presence of any AAL was moderately associated with the presence of an
instruction assignment with p-value of .003 and Phi of .346, and mildly associated with
user needs with p-value .034 and Phi of .240. The association suggested that syllabi
containing any element of AAL are likely to also include a requirement to complete an
instruction assignment and may also address user needs. The second AAL which
addresses the empowerment and self-direction expressed through the appropriate
identification of information sources had a significant association with the interview
assignment with a p-value of .038 and Phi of .298. It is possible the correlation is
indicative of the self-starting nature of AAL 2 and conducting an interview. Finally, the
fifth AAL which addresses the adult learner’s internal motivation and need to incorporate
information into an existing knowledge base was statistically associated with the
instruction assignment. With a p-value of .038 and Phi of .265, this moderate association
could possibly be explained by the recognition of the importance of the student’s goals
and needs (or motivation) when developing successful instruction.
82

Academic library courses. An examination of the sub samples of academic
library courses and instruction courses also provided some interesting results. In a subset
of the sample containing only courses designated as academic library courses, three
significant associations were identified. A strong association was found between the
general learning theory and instruction methods categories. A p-value of .000 and Phi of
.874 suggested that the likelihood of the association being coincidental is almost nonexistent, and that that actual association is so strong that we can predict that a syllabus
containing general learning theory will also contain elements of instruction methods.
Within this subgroup, the category of all assumptions of adult learning demonstrated a
moderate association with user needs. The final significant result demonstrated that the
fourth assumption of adult learning, which concerns the learner’s real-life need, has a
strongly moderate negative association with components addressing the teaching role of
academic librarians. This suggests that in courses where AAL 4 is addressed, we should
not expect the teaching role of academic librarians to be addressed.
Instruction courses. Within the subsample of courses defined as instruction
courses, four significant associations were identified, all of which relate to the instruction
assignment component. Moderate associations exist between the instruction assignment
and general learning theory, teaching role, and observation assignment. Respective pvalues of .013, .014, and .021 with Phi values of .492, .398, and .368 showed that these
elements share similar levels of association. Additionally, the category representing all of
the adult learning theories and the instruction assignment show a moderate association
83

with p-value of .013 and Phi of .391. All four of these associations suggested that any
syllabus documenting an instruction assignment are likely to contain Gen LT, teaching
role, observation assignment, and at least one component of AAL.
Pairs with non-significant results. It is important also to address some of the
category pairs in which no significant association was found. Notably, there was no
significant pairing between adult learning theory and instruction and any other categories
when the sample population was limited to either instruction courses only or academic
library courses only. This suggests that the findings related to the adult learning theory
and instruction from the entire sample population are valid across all courses rather than
only in a specific subset of courses. Similarly, there was no significant association
between any category and the third assumption of adult learning, regarding the
acknowledgement that adult learners have a wider base of knowledge with which they
must consider and compare new information. This suggests there is no predictability of
AAL 3 components based on the defined categories. Additionally, the teaching role
category, which components address the concept of academic librarians as teachers, but
not the actual act of instruction, has no significant association with any category within
the combined whole sample. Finally, and possibly surprisingly, there were no significant
relationships between the assumptions of adult learning and components of adult learning
theory and instruction in the sample or either of the sample subsets. Because both
categories represent separate aspects of adult instruction, it was expected that at least a

84

low strength association would be noted. Further exploration of this result, and those
discussed above are addressed in the following chapter, Findings and Discussion.

85

CHAPTER V
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Findings
The ultimate purpose of this research was to address the questions 1) How
prevalently are courses which focus on library instruction for academic librarians
available to students in accredited library and information science (LIS) schools in the
US? and 2) To what extent do library instruction for academic librarians courses in US
LIS programs address adult learning education theories and techniques within the scope
of information literacy instruction? In order to answer these questions in a methodical,
reliable manner, course offerings posted online as well as representative data in the form
of course syllabi were collected and analyzed. The value and relevance of online course
listings to answering these questions was comparatively straightforward. The availability
of courses focusing on instruction was determined by reviewing the total pool of
available courses and recording those which, based on title and description, met the
conditions set forth for a course to be considered focused on instruction. Similarly, this
type of review can assist in pinpointing courses which focus on library instruction in
academic library settings. However, it was important to recognize that course
descriptions and titles were not always clear or complete enough to give a full and
reliable picture of a course’s scope and coverage of subtopics and secondary or tertiary
content. As a result, the present research has delved further into the content of LIS
86

courses by examining course syllabi with the intent of identifying elements, content, and
trends related to teaching academic librarians how to be effective instructors. It was
through examination of the courses available and their syllabi that the researcher has been
able to address how prevalently courses addressing academic library instruction are
offered and to what extent adult learning was addressed in these courses.
Research Question I
Recent research into LIS instruction courses has unanimously reported that
instruction courses are available from all ALA-accredited LIS programs in the US.
However, these studies have generally failed to discern between courses available which
focus solely on K12 and those which do not. This results in a distinct gap in our
understanding of the availability of library instruction courses available for LIS students
pursuing a career in non-K12 settings, such as academic libraries. In order to shed light
on this disparity, the present research has used specific criteria to identify courses offered
by LIS programs which provide library instruction training for non-K12 librarians. In
order to address the first research question, the following postulates was posed:
Postulate I: LIS students in the US have the opportunity to undertake coursework
preparing them to provide library instruction in an academic library setting.
The research criteria were designed to identify courses which focus on instruction
for librarians in general, which can be inclusive of all types of librarianship but do not
focus primarily on K12 librarianship or courses focusing on instruction in academic,
public, or special settings so long as the course topics are not exclusive of instruction in
87

academic librarianship. Upon review of courses available among the population, which
can be viewed in Appendix A, it became clear that as a topic instruction can be, and often
is, addressed in a myriad of ways, both directly and tangentially. Because the purpose of
this research was to examine courses which prepare LIS students to provide instruction,
an additional criteria was developed to identify courses which specifically offer
instruction training to be considered an instruction course. This criteria required a course
to be focused on instruction itself, or the primary topic of instruction, such as
bibliographic instruction or information literacy instruction. While courses focused
entirely on helping students to learn to use various media, systems, and tools in
instruction settings can be important, without a solid foundation in instruction as a
discipline, these courses which focus solely on a specific application or media are of
limited benefit. This requirement then excluded any courses focused solely on the
products or supplements of instruction. For example, a course on bibliographic
instruction and design would be included, but a course exclusively focused on developing
media for an educational setting would not be included. This ensures that only LIS
programs offering courses providing their students with foundational practical and/or
theoretical background in instruction are identified in the determination of availability of
instruction courses.
Affirming postulate I. By reviewing the available courses and their descriptions
on LIS program websites, it was clear that instruction courses which focus on, or include
in their focus, instruction in academic libraries were widely available among LIS
88

programs in the US. Of the 50 ALA-accredited programs reviewed, 49 offered some form
of instruction course for their students. However, in three of these programs, the only
available instruction courses were specific to or intended for K12 librarians. Therefore,
while instruction courses are available in nearly all LIS programs, students intending on a
career in academic librarianship would only find suitable courses in 92% (n=46) of LIS
programs. Research shows that LIS preparation of K12 librarians has included instruction
preparation much longer than that of other librarians, and that while instruction in all
libraries share some similarities, there are some significant difference between providing
instruction to K12 library users and the users in academic, public, or special libraries.
Thus it was not unexpected to find courses specifically for K12 librarians, nor was it
unusual to find courses focusing on library instruction in academic, public, special, and
other non-K12 libraries covered in the same course. Yet, it could be of some concern that
despite the importance of instruction among common librarian duties in academic
libraries, courses preparing librarians in this professional skill are not universally offered
among all LIS programs. Additional concern may arise from the ambiguities of language
used in some course descriptions. In one LIS program which offers only a K12
instruction course, neither the title nor description explicitly identify the course as
intended for K12 librarians. Instead terms like “curriculum” and “teaching partner” are
used in the description but provide limited indication of the course’s area focus. The
failure to clearly identify the course coverage could lead to students enrolling in the
course mistakenly, or even result in the potentially more problematic situation of students
89

joining an LIS program based on course descriptions which fail to plainly promote their
offerings.
Impact of affirming postulate I. A potential problem exists with respect to the
incomplete availability of instruction courses across LIS due to the fact that surveys of
LIS students and practicing librarians generally demonstrate that instruction skills and
training are desired at the LIS program level. Westbrock and Fabian’s 2010 study showed
a distinct desire among library professionals to develop library instruction proficiencies
within the scope of LIS curricula. They found that of the 41 proficiencies identified, less
than 10% of librarians surveyed reported acquiring 37 of the proficiencies in LIS
programs, and 10 – 27% reported gaining the remaining 4 proficiencies in LIS programs.
In glaring contrast, the same respondents reported a preference to learn two-thirds (27) of
these proficiencies in their LIS programs. In the same vein, Walter (2008) notes that
librarians interviewed brought up their concerns for the lack of library instruction training
in LIS programs without being asked directly. Olivas (2013) found that former K12
teachers who later became librarians found their prior work experience highly beneficial
in their librarian roles, but that they received little to no training for instruction in their
LIS programs. The present study indicates that while most LIS programs are providing
their students at least with the option of undertaking library instruction coursework as a
part of their degree program, the role of these courses in preparing students for their
future careers as librarians has not yet collectively recognized.

90

In addition to perceptions and desires of LIS students and graduates, the impact of
8% of LIS schools not providing their students with the opportunity to take courses
focused on library instruction in non-K12 settings may be of consequence in the
professional field. Senior librarians routinely expect new librarians to arrive capable of
instructional duties. It is not uncommon for library instruction duties and requirements to
receive more emphasis than those of traditional reference in academic librarian job
advertisements (Goetsch, 2008). Gold found that job advertisements identified the need
for applicants to have instructional design skills (46%) as the fourth most frequently
required skill, behind administrative skills, subject knowledge, and leadership skills. As
recently as 2013, Hall found that library instruction was identified as very important at
87% of libraries represented in his survey, and 72% of library positions advertised. This
further indicates that LIS programs could consider specialized library instruction courses
as an important portion of their curriculum.
Though the majority of LIS programs have included instruction courses to
academic library track students in their course offerings, the need for instruction training
has not been recognized universally among all LIS programs. The present study suggests
that 8% of LIS programs are not providing their students a formal opportunity to prepare
for what has become a significant part of their librarian career. The increase in instruction
duties for academic librarians coupled with students’ desires to learn instruction skills in
LIS programs and managing librarians’ expectations that they will have done so indicates
that LIS programs which do not already offer non-K12 instruction courses may improve
91

support to their students by doing so. Potentially the whole of LIS in the US may wish to
consider how library instruction is prioritized and addressed in LIS curricula. Based on
the extant research addressing LIS student and graduate desires, hiring librarians’
expectations, and job requirements, it is clear that though the majority of LIS programs
provide library instruction courses, a more universally adopted and emphasized focus on
library instruction in LIS curricula may be beneficial.
Research Question II
At present, the extent to which library instruction courses in LIS address adult
learning as evidenced by their course syllabi is exceptionally limited. The use of adult
learning theory and techniques by academic librarians has been briefly addressed in
extant research (Cooke, 2010; Gold, 2005; Ingram, 2001; Malik, 2016); however, until
now, there have been no studies which explore the extent to which LIS students are
taught to instruct adult learners based on their specific learning styles, behaviors, and
needs. Pursuant to this purpose, the present study has examined the content of library
instruction course syllabi to develop insight into the scope and coverage of these topics
currently offered in LIS programs in the US. The following postulate was used to answer
the second research question.
Postulate II: US LIS courses in academic library instruction address the specific
needs of mature learners as part of preparing students to provide library
instruction.

92

Two tests were developed to determine the direct and indirect coverage of adult
learning theory in LIS instruction and academic library courses. Occurrences of elements
reflecting any of the five assumptions about adult learners (AAL) were used to identify
with what frequency and in what means LIS courses address adult learning needs as a
portion of their content. Because AALs can be demonstrated abstractly or indirectly to
the named concept of adult learning, the research also identified content relating to adult
learning theory or practice. The content analysis of course syllabi to identify AAL and
adult learning theory or practice elements showed that relatively few courses addressed
adult learning theory or practice in their course syllabi, and only one did so with a strong
focus.
Assumptions about adult learning. The appearance of AAL in the course syllabi
was relatively limited. Among the sample of 73 syllabi, 17 (9.6%) demonstrated elements
representing at least one of the five AALs. These syllabi represent LIS courses at 14
(36.8%) of the 38 institutions represented in the sample.
Among the different AALs, number 2, which emphasizes the adult learners need
for self-directed learning was addressed in eight (11%) of the course syllabi. One
example of AAL 2 in context appears when the instructor of a course demonstrated
recognition of the LIS students’ adult learning characteristics in that they should be selfdirected in the development of their assignments to meet their own professional interests
and needs by stating in the course overview that students “are encouraged to tailor
assignments and activities to [their] chosen career context.”
93

AAL 4, which emphasizes the adult learner’s emphasis on real-life information
needs as frequently demonstrated by point-of-need elements was similarly present in
eight (11.0%) different syllabi. This can be demonstrated in one syllabi in which the
instructor lists in course objectives the expectations that students completing the course
should be able to “Apply instructional strategies and communication to point-of-need
contexts.” Point-of-need in this context serves as an umbrella term which may include
real life information needs of adult learners.
AAL 5, addressing internal motivation and incorporation of information into the
learner’s own knowledge base, was identified in four (5.5%) syllabi. For example, in one
course syllabus, the instructor demonstrated the fifth assumption of adult learning
through the instructor’s own teaching philosophy stating, “You are going to be a
professional, and I am working on that premise, so my first assumption is that you are
here to learn.” By affirming the students’ internal motivation as their professional desire
to learn, the course instruction philosophy demonstrated the internal motivation
characteristic of adult learners.
The third AAL, addressing the process of comparing new knowledge to old and
determining the value of adoption, was identified in only one (1.4%) of the sample syllabi
which included a course required reading which focused on giving voice to the student
through instruction. The first AAL was not identified in any syllabi in the sample set.
Discussion about frequency of AAL in course syllabi. There are several potential
reasons why AAL elements were not more commonly represented among the sample set.
94

It is possible that LIS courses are simply not teaching these concepts to their students.
However, because the AALs are representative but not exclusive to the concepts or
practice of adult learning, it is likely that they are minimally represented for another, or
other, reasons. The AALs are by nature concepts which make up portions of larger
topical discussions. For example, AAL 5 may be addressed in discussions of user
services, instruction, or reference. Similarly, AAL 2 and 4 may be discussed directly or
within the context of instruction delivery and planning such as embedded librarianship or
library liaison roles. Due to this subordinate or embedded nature, it is very likely that the
AALs are present in substantially more courses than can be identified through the content
analysis of the sample syllabi. Nonetheless, the content analysis demonstrates that the
AAL are addressed in some courses, and by analyzing where these elements are located
within the course these findings could give future studies and LIS instructors and students
information on where the elements may be identified in practiced course content. Eight
separate syllabi components were identified for the purpose of categorizing the inclusion
of assumptions about adult learning elements. These categories are course title, course
description, about course or course overview, objectives or goals, whole modules or
units, module or unit sub-topics, readings, and assignments.
In total, 24 instances of AALs were identified among 17 different syllabi. The
AALs were most commonly identified in the course were the objectives or goals
categories with six (25.0% of the total AAL instances) and course about or overview with
five (20.8%) instances. An additional four instances were identified in module or unit
95

sub-topics (16.7%), three each in course description and readings (12.5%), two in
assignments (8.3%), and one in whole module or units (4.2%). Table 5.1 below shows the
individual categories and the instances of each AAL among the 17 identified course
syllabi.

As indicated by the table, AAL IV was the most commonly identified of the
assumptions representing 45.8% of the instances. Seven of these instances, notably,
occurred in description, about or overview, or objective and goal categories suggesting
that while AAL 4 may not be explicitly and thoroughly addressed in course syllabi, real
life need for information may be an overarching theme in some LIS courses. Similarly,
AAL 2 represented 29.2% of all assumptions found. These instances were distributed
fairly evenly over all of the categories save title and assignment. This suggests that
aspects of self-directed learning can be addressed throughout most portions of a LIS
course. The distribution of AAL 5, which represents 20.8% of the total instances suggests
that internal motivation and the incorporation of new knowledge is both a thematic and
actionable portion of a LIS course. The limited occurrence of AAL 3 (4.2%), which deals
with comparing the value of new knowledge to existing knowledge, and absence of AAL
1, which addresses information need based on cost of acquisition suggest either than
these concepts are rarely if ever addressed in LIS courses, or possibly more likely that
their presence in syllabi is limited by their nature. As is the case with all of the AAL
concepts, it is possible that their abstract nature which, particularly for AAL 3 and 1,
makes these assumptions somewhat difficult to express as distinct and brief goals,
outcome, or elements of a course or lesson, means their true coverage in LIS courses is
underrepresented in course syllabi. This could explain the more common occurrence of
AAL 2 and 4 in the syllabi as real-life information need and self-directed learning may be
somewhat more direct concepts than the other AALs.
97

Notably, the occurrence of AALs as a group did not demonstrate a relationship
with the occurrence of adult learning theory or instruction among the sample syllabi (‫ ݌‬ൌ
ǤͲͷ͹, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥʹ͵͵). This suggests that AALs can be and are approached separately from
direct instruction of adult learning theory and instruction in LIS courses. Individually,
only AAL 5 showed significant evidence of a relationship with the appearance of adult
learning theory or instruction elements (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲ͵͹, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥʹ͸ͷ). Despite only having
demonstrated a relatively weak relationship, this suggests that of all the AALs, internal
motivation is the most likely to be included in a course directly addressing adult learning
theory or instruction.
Adult learning theory or instruction. Of the 73 syllabi collected, 17 (9.6%)
included some form of adult learning theory or instruction content. These courses were
offered by LIS programs at 15 (39.5%) institutions represented by the study sample.
Though this represents a fair portion of the institutions included in the study, the level of
coverage of adult learning theory or instruction in these courses varied from extensive to
brief.
Example of adult learning theory or instruction in course syllabi. In some
syllabi, adult learning theory or instruction was directly addressed. For example, in one
syllabus the instructor stated in the course description that “Special attention is paid to
adult learning theory and to the integration of information seeking behavior with
instructional design,” and listed “To introduce adult learning theory” as one of the course
objectives. Other syllabi included required and recommended readings which directly
98

address adult learning such as Stern and Kaur’s “Developing Theory-Based, Practical
Information Literacy Training for Adults” in one instruction course syllabus and both
Merriam, Caffarella, and Baumgartner’s Learning in Adulthood: A Comprehensive Guide
and “Third Updated on Adult Learning Theory” in New Directions for Adult and
Continuing Education edited by Merriam in another.
Relevance of location of adult learning theory or instruction elements. Though
the actual practiced scope and coverage of adult learning theory or instruction is difficult
to determine without engaging wholly in each of the instruction courses identified,
examining the course syllabi allowed the researcher to get some indication of the
emphasis placed on adult learning theory or instruction by identifying when and how it is
addressed in each course. The same eight separate syllabi components used to categorize
instances of AAL were used for the purpose of categorizing the inclusion of adult
learning theory or instruction elements. Of the eight categories, course title, course
description, and whole module or units were considered to be indicators of moderate
coverage of adult learning theory or instruction as they would likely indicate a more
significant level of importance in the context of the course. Module or unit sub-topics,
objectives or goals, about and course overview, readings, and assignments were
considered to be indicators of lesser coverage of adult learning theory or instruction.
However, the combination of multiple elements from different categories could indicate
strong coverage with a relative increase in coverage and possibly scope. See Table 5.2 for
category tallies and course syllabi totals.
99

Based on these categories, 1 of the 17 courses showed strong coverage of adult
learning theory or instruction, with elements identified in 6 of the 8 categories. Only one
other course had more than one element of adult learning theory or instruction, and
represented high-moderate coverage through course description and a module or unit subtopic. One course displayed high-moderate coverage as it included a whole module or
unit component concerned with adult learning theory or instruction. An additional two
demonstrated low-moderate coverage by including adult learning theory or instruction
elements in the course description. The remaining 12 courses demonstrate only weak
coverage of adult learning theory or instruction. Readings were the most common syllabi
component (8, 47%) to represent the inclusion of adult learning theory or instruction in
course coverage. No course included adult learning theory or instruction elements in its
title. Course description was the second most common element (4, 23.5%) however, as
noted, this was the sole element identified in three of the four course syllabi indicating
that coverage may be less than moderate depending on the accuracy and fullness of the
syllabi in representing the actual course. Three syllabi indicate adult learning theory or
instruction elements in goals and objectives but only one of these follows up with
additional components. Three courses included adult learning theory or instruction in
their syllabi in the about or overview and one course included an element in a course
assignment described in the syllabus.

Based on the evaluation of course syllabi components, though 23.3% of the
syllabi collected contain adult learning theory or instruction elements, only one (1.4%)
demonstrates strong coverage of adult learning theory or instruction. An additional four
(5.5%) and 12 (16.4%) show moderate and low coverage respectively. The sample syllabi
for current instruction courses in LIS programs suggest there is little significant coverage
of adult learning theory or instruction is LIS courses. While the true coverage of adult
learning theory or instruction cannot be exactly determined by extrapolating the
101

information from this sample, it appears to be clear that strong coverage of the topic is
exceptionally limited among LIS courses. However, there is indication that adult learning
theory or instruction are not entirely ignored by LIS courses, and based on the indicators
which suggest the topic is covered commonly through subtopics, readings, and
assignments (n=11) it is reasonable to assume that less thorough syllabi may in fact
represent courses which address adult learning theory or instruction at this level.
Nonetheless, there is evidence to suggest that adult learning theory or instruction is
acknowledged in LIS curricula, but not to general extent. This would suggest the average
LIS student pursuing a career in academic librarianship may not be exposed to the topic
with any great depth in their LIS education.
Discussion
Syllabi Components as Indicators
Due to the variances expected and experienced among content and thoroughness
of sample syllabi, it is useful to examine patterns that exist among various syllabi
components which may suggest the inclusion of adult learning theory or instruction in
LIS courses whose syllabi were not included in the sample or were not exhaustive
representation of course coverage and scope. As discussed in the data collection and
analysis chapter, Fisher’s Exact test was used to identify significant indication of
relationships between various syllabi components. The data indicated that weak to
moderate relationships existed between adult learning theory or instruction and the
elements user needs (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲ͵Ͷ, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  ǤʹͶͲ), instruction methods (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲͲͲ, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥ͵ͻͶ),
102

AAL 5 (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲ͵͹, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥʹͻͷ), general learning theory (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲͲͳ, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥ͵ͺͳ), instruction
assignments (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲͲ͵, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥ͵Ͷ͸), and own philosophy development assignments (‫ ݌‬ൌ
ǤͲͶ͹, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥʹ͸ͳ). This could suggest that courses which include any of these elements
may be more likely to also have some coverage of adult learning theory or instruction
whether or not it is listed specifically in the course syllabus. The moderate relationship
between general learning theory and adult learning theory or instruction suggests there is
a relationship between the inclusion of adult learning theory or instruction when any
learning theory is covered in a LIS course. This is a positive indicator that adult learning
theory may be considered useful and important among LIS instructors who are providing
their students with a theoretical foundation in learning theory. Similarly, the relationship
between adult learning theory or instruction and instruction methods and own philosophy
assignments suggest that practicing adult learning theory or instruction skills and
methods may be recognized as desired among the instructors training librarians.
This information on the relationships between various elements of LIS courses
defined in their syllabi could potentially be used by LIS students and prospective students
to identify courses which may cover adult learning theory or instruction, giving them an
opportunity to make informed inquiries about the coverage of this topic in courses at their
institutions. Similarly, this information could allow instructors to examine their courses
for areas where adult learning theory or instruction may be increasingly emphasized or
added naturally to existing content.

103

Using the same test for relationships, this study found that AALs as a group
demonstrate a weak to moderate relationship with user needs (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲ͵Ͷ, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  ǤʹͶͲ) and
instruction assignment (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲͲ͵, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥ͵Ͷ͸) components. The relationship with the user
needs component comes as little surprise due to the user-centric nature of the AALs. This
does, however suggest that courses addressing user needs could easily, and potentially
may more often than is possible to be indicated by the syllabi in the sample, include
critical elements of understanding and catering to the needs of adult learners in their
coverage and scope. The moderate relationship between the AALs and instruction
assignments suggests that course elements designed to help students practice instruction
already often contain elements reflective of adult learners needs. Weak relationships
between AAL 2 and interview assignments (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲ͵ͺ, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥʹͻͺ), and AAL 5 and
instruction assignments (‫ ݌‬ൌ ǤͲ͵ͺ, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥʹ͸ͷ) similarly suggests there is some adoption
of these assumptions in LIS courses despite not being explicitly addressed as adult
learning related. That these relationships are seen between AALs and assignments is
encouraging because it hints that while the assumptions may not occupy a primary status
in the course description or purpose, they are considered important enough to be included
as measurable elements for students’ instruction skills development. Again, due to the
variances among syllabi content and detail, many of the syllabi included in the sample
contained limited or no descriptions of course assignments. It is therefore possible that
AALs may be addressed in a greater portion of courses than are indicated in the analysis
of sample syllabi.
104

Because the AAL were developed by combining ACRL’s Information Literacy
Competency Standards for Higher Education and Knowles’ characteristics of adult
learners, it is somewhat surprising that they were not more commonly represented in
academic library and library instruction syllabi due to the fact that ILCSHE is commonly
used among academic libraries. Because the AALs can be addressed from either
direction, as instructor evaluating student need or student needs to be addressed in
libraries, it is possible that they are addressed more often in these courses than can be
adequately represented in the syllabi. However, their general absence from course syllabi
does suggest that these elements may be more likely to appear in course substrata rather
than as primary topics or subject matter on their own. While addressing AALs indirectly
is likely of some benefit to LIS students, the extant research suggests that not only do LIS
students want library instruction education in their schooling, many feel that it is
unavailable to them despite nearly all LIS programs offering such courses (Click &
Walker, 2009; Olivas, 2013; Westbrock & Fabian, 2010). It is possible, then, that
indirectly addressing key components to adult learning and instruction may be
inadequately preparing LIS students for academic librarianship.
Suggestions and Information for LIS Instructors
Based on the evidence from this study, LIS programs and their instructors might
consider making changes to their courses to give more attention to preparing their
students to provide instruction in academic libraries. The unique confluence of maturing
and immature library users in higher education settings demand library instructors who
105

are able to provide instructions that will meet the needs of young and adult learners alike.
Trends in the sample of the present study suggest that there is some coverage of adult
learning theory and instruction, but that it is not yet universal, or even common. One
factor which may be complicating this trend is the understanding and use of the term
pedagogy. By definition, pedagogy refers specifically to the teaching of children
(Pedagogy, n., 2016); however, traditionally, it is commonly used to refer to education
theory in general. Several of the syllabi in the research sample demonstrated this
traditional use of the term. While a choice between the phrase “education theory” and
“pedagogy” may have limited impact in the actual execution and function of an LIS
course, it could be problematic for both instructor and student understanding. By using
the term pedagogy, adult learning theory may be in part excluded. Though instructors
may include adult learning theory under the umbrella term, it is possible that at least
indirectly this limits the inclusion of adult learning theory in LIS courses. For example,
instructors seeking current publications to share with their students may fail to identify
relevant and critical articles in their searches if they focus solely on pedagogy for their
query terms. Similarly, students may develop confused understanding of how adult
learning theory fits into educational theory if pedagogy is used as a catchall term. It thus
falls to LIS instructors and LIS programs to consider the implications of becoming more
discerning in their use of pedagogy and adult learning theories as separate but related
parts of education theory so that they may incorporate a variety of education theory into
their courses to fully prepare their students for futures as library instructors.
106

Additionally, LIS instructors might consider providing more focused coverage of
adult learning theory in their courses. The ARCL Information Literacy Competency
Standards for Higher Education lends itself readily to the use of theory and instruction for
adult learners as is demonstrated by the development of the assumptions of adult learning
in this study. In addition to providing students with pedagogical skills, instructors could
potentially amplify the benefit of their courses by juxtaposing adult learning theory and
instruction lessons with those they already teach. By empowering the students with
additional understanding of variety of student learning needs they will face, LIS
instructors will be giving their students a more effective and fuller set of skills and
knowledge to rely on in their library workplaces.
The knowledge acquired by identifying relationships between adult learning
theory or instruction and other course content could possibly aid LIS instructors in
identifying ways and areas in which they may introduce or expand coverage of adult
learning in their courses. As noted in the discussion of assumptions of adult learning, user
needs are regularly addressed in LIS instruction (84.6%) and academic library courses
(53.8%) in the sample. Because the impetus for including adult learning theory and
instruction in LIS course content is due to the specific learning needs of an increasingly
mature set of academic library users, it follows that instructors could use existing lessons
on user needs to introduce the need for academic librarians to work with, and instruct,
adult library users. This introduction could then be used to support the inclusion of adult
learning theory and instruction skills along with existing lessons. In the same vein, the
107

common inclusion of general learning theories and instruction methods (each 84.6%) in
instruction courses indicates that adult learning theory could easily be incorporated into
the same lesson(s) where instructors have not already done so. The relationship between
adult learning theory or instruction and assignments such as developing a teaching
philosophy or instruction plan or lesson similarly indicates that adult learning theory and
instruction practice and evaluation are equally feasible in the LIS classroom.
Suggestions and Information for LIS Students
The benefit of these findings to LIS students and perspective students are twofold.
First, the results suggest changes could be made to LIS education to provide students
with a more thorough instruction knowledge and skills base. And secondly, the
examination of course content relationships gives students some insight on how and
where in courses adult learning theory and instruction may be addressed.
The topic of adult learning theory and instruction could potentially have the added
bonus in LIS classrooms of being mirrored by the instructor’s own teaching. The
demonstration of these skills could help students understand the concepts and practices,
and also support evidence of effectiveness while allowing them to gain knowledge of the
theory and practice from a student’s perspective. This could in turn allow them to
approach their future library instruction with a well-developed sense of practice and
effect. Evidence from previous research suggests that LIS students demonstrate
significant gains from being afforded the opportunity to view and practice instruction
(Becnel et al., 2016; Cooke & Hensley, 2013; Hensley, 2015; Meulemans & Brown,
108

2003; Nutefall, 2012). Therefore, it could be helpful for LIS faculty to use their course
instruction to model effective adult learning theory. A student who experiences
successful instruction in conjunction with learning about the theory and skills associated
with that same instruction may be more likely to see its benefit and put it into practice
herself. There is evidence in the present research that this practice has been adopted by at
least one LIS instructor, who directly addresses the characteristics of adult learning as
expectations from students in the course overview, as discussed in the examples of
instruction related content in Chapter Four.
By adopting this method of demonstrative instruction, LIS instructors could
introduce adult learning theory and instruction, and with little effort beyond emphasizing
the use of adult learning theory and instruction their class, provide students with a
valuable lesson on the benefit and implications of providing instruction for adult learners.
It also follows that because LIS students are adult learners, instructors who employ adult
learning techniques and methods in their instruction may see more success in their
teaching than they would using pedagogical methods. It is therefore reasonable for LIS
programs to review the use and inclusion of adult learning theories and instruction
throughout their programs’ content and delivery and provide instructors with appropriate
support and encouragement to make adult learning a critical part of LIS education in
order to improve students’ learning and knowledge.
Though it is potentially ideal that all LIS programs would offer their students with
an instruction course suitable to their library type, and each of those courses would in
109

turn, when geared toward academic librarians, provide students with theoretical and
practical foundations in adult learning theory, this is not presently the case. It may then
be down to students, at least in part, to seek out and make opportunities to explore
instruction for adult users within existing courses. Though the syllabi in the sample
generally provide a summary of course content, there is little, if anything stopping
students from raising questions, engaging in discussions, focusing assignments, or further
exploring adult learning theory and instruction in their courses. However, to do this, the
student must be aware how adult learning could be relevant to their profession.
Additional coverage of academic library student populations and academic librarians’
instruction duties would potentially be very beneficial to students in the early stages of
their LIS education as it could allow them to make informed decisions about course
selection and use course content and assignments to focused, relevant ends. In support of
this cause, LIS programs as a whole should consider the inclusion of discussion of the
variety of user types and instruction duties librarians are likely to encounter in their
program overviews, course planning details, and foundational courses if they do not
already do so.
When students identify a need to include adult learning theory and instruction in
their LIS educations, it could be helpful to them to know in what course settings they
may find the topic included or in which courses they may be able to raise the topic with
their instructor or classmates. Using the relationship data found in this study, LIS
students could reasonably anticipate exposure to, or the opportunity to raise adult
110

learning theory and instruction as a relevant topic in library instruction courses. Though
this study suggests academic library courses are less likely to include the subject of adult
learning as a topic in the course syllabi than instruction courses, the course topic user
needs was present in 53.8% of the sample of academic library courses. A strong
relationship between user needs and the assumptions of adult learning may imply
students could bring up adult learning in conjunction with this topic in academic library
courses. Similarly, students could potentially use the inclusion of certain course elements,
such as general learning theory and instruction methods in course syllabi as predictors for
the inclusion of adult learning topics in courses. The moderate relationships between each
of these topics and adult learning, ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥ͵ͺͳ‫ ׎‬ൌ  Ǥ͵ͻͶ respectively, suggest that
students who seek out courses containing these topics may be more likely to see adult
learning theory addressed in the same course than they would in courses not addressing
these topics.
Summation
Using this information, LIS students could potentially empower themselves in the
development of their library professional skills and knowledge. However, new and
prospective students are far less likely to have reviewed the literature relating to LIS
education than instructors and program administrators. Thus, the onus remains largely
with those who plan, develop, and lead LIS courses on library instruction and academic
librarianship to recognize and react to the growing need for academic librarians to enter

111

the workforce with knowledge and skills appropriate to providing effective instruction for
adult library users.
To do this, LIS programs and instructors should consider evaluating their current
coverage of adult learning theory and instruction with the aim of making it a topic in the
preparation of academic librarians. In order to effectively integrate adult learning theory
and instruction into their courses, however, LIS instructors may need to nurture their own
knowledge and skills-base in the topic. Because LIS instructors are themselves teaching
adults, the further development and extension of these skills into course content could be
relatively straight-forward. However, LIS programs could potentially encourage their
instructors to prepare students to teach using their own knowledge and skills-base in adult
learning theory and instruction. And, when necessary, LIS programs could provide
instructors with additional support to develop their own instruction skills to teach their
students to teach adults.

CHAPTER VI
SUMMARY, LIMITATIONS, IMPLICATIONS, AND CONCLUSION
Summary
The purpose of this study has been to examine the state of library instruction curricula
in ALA-accredited LIS programs in the United States. Though this topic has been
addressed previously, the extant research has not thoroughly explored the availability and
adequacy of courses to address the professional needs of academic librarians to provide
instruction to mature library users. In order to attend to this gap in the existing body of
knowledge, the present research has examined library and information science (LIS)
programs to determine the availability of library instruction courses for academic
librarians and explored if and how these courses addressed adult learning theory and
instruction.
Review of Findings
It is clear that instruction is a major part of academic librarianship. Literature
examining job advertisements and supervising librarian expectations indicates a distinct
need for LIS students to enter librarian roles with instruction skills. Unfortunately, the
extant literature also suggests new librarians often feel unprepared by their LIS education
to provide instruction. Though opportunities exist for librarians to develop or further
expand their instruction knowledge and skills through professional training and on the job
experience, there is a need for academic librarians to poses a demonstrable aptitude for
113

instruction in the nascent stages of an academic library career. This, paired with
indications that academic librarians have a desire to obtain instruction knowledge and
skills in their LIS education, suggests that LIS programs should be providing their
students with the necessary exposure and experiences to feel able and confident to engage
in instruction.
In addition to providing students pursuing a career in academic librarianship with
the foundations they need to provide instruction in the library setting, it may be important
that these preparations take into account the needs of the library users with whom
academic librarians will work. Student populations in higher education now regularly
include a growing number of mature or adult students. Mature students of the past were
often graduate students who could be viewed as less likely to need or receive traditional
library instruction compared to undergraduate students, though instruction for graduate
students has been a topic of research and discussion since the late 1950s (Blummer,
2009). Yet, as higher education student populations have seen increasing numbers of
returning students, distance students, and traditional aged students with extensive life
experiences, it is important to continue to examine the needs of this unique group in order
to create tailored instruction in academic libraries. As these mature and adult students
continue to make up a significant portion of student populations in US higher education,
it may be useful for academic librarians to be prepared to provide instruction suitable to
these mature students’ unique information and learning needs.

114

The specific needs of mature learners have been addressed within the field of
education theory and practice by adult learning theory and instruction which provides
mature learners with instruction tailored to the way we understand adults learn. A
prominent figure in adult learning theory, Malcolm Knowles, identified six characteristics
of adult learners. According to these characteristics, mature learners need instruction
which will recognize and address their:
1. Independent and self-governed information needs.
2. Need to direct their own learning.
3. Reliance upon their own rich knowledge base when learning.
4. Learning needs based on changing social and professional roles.
5. Tendency to seek information for specific problems with the intent of
immediate application.
6. Internal motivation to learn.
The present study developed a picture of how Knowles’ characteristics when combined
with the ACRL’s Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education
(2000) through a set of assumptions about adult learners in higher education which can be
used to determine if and how the needs of adult students in academic libraries are being
met by academic librarians.
This study found that LIS students in the US do have the opportunity to take
instruction courses suitable for academic librarianship. Instruction courses for non-K12
library settings are available at 46 of 50 ALA-accredited programs in the US. Though
115

these courses carry a variety of titles, the course descriptions widely available on program
websites provide course details which are generally adequate to determine the course’s
relevance to non-K12 library instruction, even to an individual with a nascent
understanding of library instruction terminology. The study found, however, that in one
case, the course title and description were ambiguous. In some other cases, while
instruction features in the course title, the description indicates that the course exclusively
addresses instruction tools rather than instruction practice or theory.
The topic of adult learning theory and instruction is not widely addressed in ALA
accredited LIS programs in the United States. The sample of course syllabi indicated that
relatively few programs offer courses which cover adult learning theory and instruction to
a level adequate to be represented in the course syllabus. Less than 10% of syllabi in the
sample included any element of adult learning theory and instruction. And less than 10%
of the syllabi in the sample include any element of assumptions of adult learning. Only
37% of the sample included either adult learning theory or instruction or assumptions
about adult learning. Only one syllabus indicated that adult learning theory was strongly
covered in the course. In this case, the course included adult learning theory in six of the
eight course categories represented in the syllabus. Four additional syllabi indicated
moderate coverage of adult learning theory. A further 12 addressed adult learning theory
only in readings, course overview, or similar lesser means. Only two syllabi (2.7%) in the
sample included whole modules addressing adult learning theory or instruction topics.

116

Based on the need for academic librarians to enter the professional workforce with
the skills and knowledge necessary to develop and execute effective library instruction as
demonstrated by the extant literature, and an increasing population of adult learners in
higher education, it is suggested that LIS programs examine their current practices to
ensure their curriculum fully meets the needs of their students. As indicated by the
findings of the present study, LIS programs are not currently meeting this need. Or,
alternatively, LIS instructors understanding of adult learning theory and its application to
library instruction is poorly represented in their course syllabi. Though the majority of
programs offer courses in instruction, there is little evidence that the instruction of adult
learners is addressed in professional librarian education.
Study Limitations
This study was undertaken with great care and diligence to ensure as accurate and
representative results as possible were obtained from the study population. Yet, due to the
nature of the inquiry and relevant study design, some limitations must be acknowledged.
The following discussion addresses these limitations and how they impact the study
findings.
Course Type
Though the topic of library instruction could be addressed in a variety of LIS
courses, the present study included only instruction courses and academic library courses
in the population from which samples were taken. Only reference courses which included
user needs or instruction in the title or description were included during sampling. The
117

reasoning behind this decision was that only courses which presented themselves as
instruction courses or courses for academic librarianship could be fundamentally
understood as preparation for academic library instruction roles by prospective LIS
students with naïve understanding of the profession. That is, perspective or current
students who sought out academic library instruction in LIS courses may only consider
courses with direct, specific links to the topic. However, because library instruction roles
are often undertaken by or within the purview of reference librarianship or other librarian
positions, it is possible that the availability of adult learning theory and instruction in LIS
programs is underrepresented by this sample.
In the same vein, courses focusing on non-K12 librarianship other than academic
librarianship may include adult learning theory and instruction. Though not explicit to
academic library students, courses generally geared towards public, special, law, or
medical librarian students may in fact offer future academic librarians with the
opportunity to develop instruction for mature learners knowledge and skills. Because
courses whose titles were specific exclusively to these other non-K12 libraries were
excluded from the sample, it is possible that their descriptions could include information
that academic librarians could benefit from the course. This could similarly result in the
underrepresentation of the true availability of adult learning theory and instruction across
all LIS courses.

118

Sampling Bias
Due to the nature of the study, the sample was developed through voluntary
inclusion. Voluntary sampling is recognized as having some amount of inherent bias as it
means the sample is not random. In this study, the samples were obtained in two methods
which each posed limitations due to their voluntary nature.
A portion of the sample syllabi was acquired online. Syllabi included in the
sample which were published online were voluntarily posted by the instructor, program,
or school. The purpose of this study would not have any influence on the decision to post
a syllabi online or the content of the shared document. However, the researcher is unable
to determine the completeness of any of the syllabi posted online and it is possible that
syllabi may be abbreviate from their full form when posted online. For example, elements
such as readings or assignments may be omitted as they can change with each term.
Because these elements reflected the most incidents of adult learning theory or instruction
in the sample, this could result in underreporting of the true coverage of adult learning
theory and instruction in LIS. Nonetheless, including syllabi posted online in the sample
played a critical role in representing the information available to perspective and current
LIS students seeking information about available courses.
The majority of the study samples were acquired through request. The sample
syllabi acquired through direct appeal were given voluntarily by LIS instructors or LIS
representatives such as deans or administrators. One complication to this sampling
methods arises from the fact that the request for syllabi included study purpose. As a
119

result, some instructors replied that their courses did not cover the topic of concern and
did not provide a syllabi as evidence. This may have resulted in a sample which was
more heavily concentrated with courses that did address adult learning theory or
instruction than actually exists in LIS programs in the US. Instructors who did not
respond to the request may have similarly believed their courses were not relevant.
Therefore the percentage of courses in the sample addressing adult learning theory and
instruction may not reflect the true condition of LIS programs in the US.
In addition to the voluntary nature of the sample, the response rate of individuals
providing syllabi was relatively modest at 34.1%. However, the number of total syllabi
collected was 73, which is comparable to similar studies (Bailey, 2010; Ishimura &
Bartlett, 2009; Saunders, 2015a; Sproles et al., 2008). Despite the low response rate, the
sample included course syllabi from a majority (64.4%) of population of ALA-accredited
LIS programs. Though the findings of this study are meant to be illustrative and
informative and were not intended to be used for generalization, a greater response
resulting in a larger sample could have resulted in different findings.
As discussed above, the voluntary nature of the sample and the need to disclose
the study purpose when requesting participation, may have adversely affected the sample
size and make-up. However, the sample is comparative to similar studies and provides
some understanding of the current coverage of adult learning theory and instruction in
some instruction and academic library courses in LIS programs in the US. We cannot
assume the results of examining these courses can be extrapolated to the whole
120

population of LIS programs or their courses. We can however, view this study within the
constraints of its purpose and design as a glimpse of whether or not and the extent to
which adult learning theory and instruction is being addressed in LIS courses.
Study Design
Though the use of content analysis to examine LIS course is an affirmed method
for examining the availability and content of courses in LIS programs, it may not provide
a complete picture of the actual coverage of the topic. Because syllabi are developed
independently of one another and are not bound by a unifying format, the content, detail,
and thoroughness of the sample syllabi vary greatly. Additional methods such as survey
or interview could be used to supplement the content analysis study design to provide
additional insight on course coverage which could not be gleaned from course syllabi.
There is no wholly perfect method for studying the content of courses across all LIS
programs in the US which could be realistically carried out. A phenomenological
approach is impractical when considering the number of institutions and courses in the
population. A survey relies on the respondents understanding and interpretation of study
concepts and themes. And, content analysis, as noted, relies on the thoroughness and
completeness of the documents being analyzed.
Implications for Library and Information Science
The following discussion provides suggestions to improve the present library
instruction curriculum of ALA-accredited programs in the US. The suggestions are made
based on the extant research and the findings of the present study. Though LIS has come
121

a significant way over the past 50 years in providing students with the opportunity to
develop and practice instruction knowledge and skills in their professional education, it is
important that these provisions are continually reviewed and addressed to ensure they
meet the needs of current and future librarians.
Suggestions Based on Study Findings
Though instruction courses are offered nearly universally among LIS programs in
the US, the availability of these courses and their suitability to all types of librarians is
not comprehensive. LIS programs may wish to ensure all students have the opportunity to
take instruction focused courses suitable to their library type. The four programs which
do not offer library instruction courses for non-K12 librarians as identified in this study
may consider reevaluating their offerings and their specific students’ needs in order to
develop a course which could provide future K12 librarians with library instruction
preparation. Similarly, in order to help students prepare for their future roles, LIS
programs may consider promoting the importance of instruction as a role in academic
librarianship in order to help students become aware of the value of instruction theory
and skills to their future profession.
Similarly, due to the increase in mature students in higher education, it is an
encouraging sign that adult learning theory and instruction has been recognized within
some LIS courses as a valid topic for LIS students. Though a limited portion of the
sample addressed adult learning theory or instruction, the results indicate that the topic is
most often covered within the scope of instruction courses rather than courses focused on
122

academic librarianship. Coverage of instruction courses could potentially expand to
include these topics with discussions of other learning theories and practices. In addition,
academic library courses have the opportunity to include adult learning theory and
instruction within their scope under the topics of user types and their needs and
instruction as crucial role in academic librarianship.
In response to the recognized needs of adult learners in academic libraries, it is
suggested that LIS programs encourage their instructors to increase the existing coverage
of this topic. This study shows there may be some ambiguity in education theory
coverage due to the common use of the term pedagogy as a catchall for learning theory.
This in turn may have implications on its use in library instruction courses. The
difference between pedagogy and adult learning, or andragogy, could potentially be
demonstrated by LIS instructors with respect to what they teach in instruction courses,
and how they teach their LIS students, who are within the scope of adult learners.
Stronger coverage of adult learning theory and instruction may be sought by developing
whole modules and whole courses focused on this topic. Instructors who are unable to
devote stronger coverage to adult learning theory and instruction directly in their courses
could provide an introduction to the topic. This would provide students with an
understanding of the varying needs of library students, and provide students with the
opportunity to further explore adult learning theory and instruction independently, or
when possible, within course discussion and assignments.

123

By following these suggestions, LIS programs may provide their students with a
more full foundation in library instruction in academic libraries. In addition, by widening
the scope of education theory addressed in library instruction courses to include adult
learners, LIS courses may be better preparing academic librarians to meet the specific
learning needs of mature students in higher education settings. And by preparing students
to provide tailored instruction in the library, it is possible that future academic librarians
will be prepared and more able to adopt additional roles and responsibilities relating to
instruction within institutions of higher education.
Future Research
Based on the present study’s findings, limitations, and suggestions, future
research should be carried out to develop a more complete understanding of the state of
library instruction curriculum in ALA-accredited LIS programs in the United States.
Future studies could build upon the findings of the present study to broaden the scope of
the research, further focus analysis, and improve the generalizability or coverage of the
findings.
A longitudinal study similar to that carried out by Julien (2005a) could provide a
deeper understanding of the true extent to which adult learning theory and instruction is
addressed by LIS programs in the US. By combining content analysis with survey and a
selected phenomenological case studies, a deeper understanding of the extent to which
adult learning theory and instruction is addressed could be developed. The present study
sought to understand if adult learning theory and instruction was being taught to future
124

academic librarians in LIS programs. Though it is being taught in some LIS programs it
is not widespread. Future studies could address the extent to which adult learning theory
and instruction is addressed in order to determine whether students are receiving
exposure to the concept or deeper training in order to inform LIS programs, professional
development, and academic libraries if it is necessary and how they can provide students
with further learning and development of knowledge and skills related to instructing adult
students. Future studies could also expand the population of interest to include reference,
library services, and other courses which do not, on the surface, refer to instruction or
academic librarianship. Because instruction has become a ubiquitous duty for many
librarians, including academic librarians, it may be addressed in a myriad of LIS courses.
Saunders’ (2015a) study shows that library instruction is commonly addressed in
reference courses.
Addressing the availability of instruction courses for non-K12 LIS students has been
exceptionally limited in the extant literature. Similarly, no previous study has explored
the availability of adult learning theory and instruction in LIS courses with the purpose of
preparing academic librarians to teach. Future studies which expand method and
population scope could provide exceptionally valuable insight in to the state of academic
library instruction preparation and the skills and knowledge future academic librarians
may be expected to possess regarding the delivery of instruction to adult students.
Despite its limitations, the present study has provided a fresh insight into the current
state of library instruction training in LIS programs in the US. Though instruction courses
125

are almost universally available, it is clear that library instruction has not achieved a
status of ubiquitous necessity in academic librarian training. As librarianship continues to
change to meet the needs of our users and means and media of information, it is
important that LIS programs continually review their offerings to meet these changes and
challenges. This study shows that some LIS courses have recognized adult learning
theory and instruction as an important aspect of preparing future librarians to teach in
higher education settings. It is hoped that the recognized value of adult learning theory
and instruction to academic librarians will continue to improve and the findings of this
study will help to inform continued development and improvement of LIS programs and
their courses in the US.
