Abstract
This executive position paper (EPP) examines the gap in Delaware’s public library services to
senior citizens engaged in lifelong learning. Re-envisioning the public library as a center that
provides support of lifelong learning for the whole individual and improving the quality of life
for Kent County’s seniors is one approach that may keep libraries relevant and vibrant in these
changing times. In the course of examining the need for a cultural center in a library setting to
fulfill the lifelong learning needs of Central Delaware seniors, a gap in library services and the
library literature was discovered. This gap supports the original need for the study, but also
indicates that public libraries state- and nation-wide need to broaden their vision, services, and
training to address the gap in senior services.

Chapter I
Framing the Context
Introduction
There is a gap in the professional library literature on how best to serve seniors, the
fastest growing demographic in America. Libraries, which pride themselves as institutions that
support and encourage lifelong learning, are not keeping pace with these changes, and have not
planned for the impact the growing number of active seniors, retired, and employed are having
and will have on services, collections, and programs now and for the foreseeable future.
This gap is occurring at a critical time for public libraries. Straitened economics
combined with eroding support for public libraries encourages some critics to declare that
libraries will soon be obsolete. If public libraries reinvent themselves, they will be in a better
position to support seniors who are actively pursuing lifelong learning. It is clear that libraries
need to expand their role in the community and better address the needs of a changing population
and the evolving times.
Public libraries are at a crossroad. While some critics feel that the heyday of public
libraries is past and their demise is imminent, there is another faction that sees the changes in the
economy and technology as an exciting opportunity for libraries to reinvent themselves.
Reinvention is a mindset that seeks what is core and fundamental that can be applied in new way.
America’s public libraries have a long history of supporting education and the arts and
humanities. “Libraries serve a variety of purposes: maintainer of local information sources,
community meeting space, study zone, and connector of people and information of all
kinds….reshaping library spaces….tilts the work of libraries from information consumers and
providers to information creators” (Burke, 2014, p. 1). “Libraries are in the lifelong learning

1

business; we help people to find and use information every day in ways that support their
learning needs and interests. Librarians are passionate about the transformational impact
libraries have upon the people who use them” (Norman, 2011, p. 3).
There are a lot of uninformed opinions about public libraries. This is not surprising given
the lack of national leadership over the decades and the lack of any national marketing or
significant debate….in the media. Those who care about libraries thus need to inform
opinion and provide the information. (Anstice, 2011, para. 9)
Even the famous futurist Richard Watson, who at one time predicted the extinction of
public libraries retracted that scenario and stated,
If libraries cease to exist, we will have to re-invent them. ....We should accept that a
library without books would still be a library because it would continue to be an
important community resource – a neutral public space – where serendipitous encounters
with people and ideas take place. This, surely, is an idea worth spreading. (Watson,
2011, para. 23, 28)
If libraries expand their definition of core services and become areas where patrons can
create art, practice dance, perform dramas, or write screenplays – a space that goes beyond a
mere computer lab to fashion resumes or research schoolwork – but instead provides guided
discovery under the tutelage of knowledgeable instructors, “libraries can spur learning,
invention, creativity, and innovation” (Burke, 2014, p. 2).
We have all seen momentous changes for public libraries. Stakeholders debate the role
of the institution and peers question the role of technology. Budget cuts threaten to close public
libraries at a time when economics has forced many users to disconnect at home and rely on
public library access.
The library has long been an engine for the democratization of knowledge and
information, but we have to recognize today that a library's role is no longer simply about
2

providing access to information. Libraries are open access by nature, and...Can take
advantage of such openness to create opportunities for partnership, collaboration, and
creation for all...In a library, curiosity and active community-based learning are front and
center. (Fleming, 2015, p. 42)
In the current economically straitened times, questions about justification of
public libraries can be tiresome in the same way that contemporary aestheticians may feel
fatigue about defining art. If the value of libraries or the arts is not self-evident, it is
challenging to advance arguments to convince those with no affinity or knowledge of
them. Not that many educators admit to falling into this category. As Eisner has said,
nobody wants to be seen as a philistine. (Fleming, 2015, p. 42)
In 2017, as the U.S. Congress struggled to balance the federal budget and end the
decades-long spiral of deficit spending, one piece of President Trump’s financial reform
blueprint was to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, and the Institute of Museums and Library Services (IMLS), among others. In the
current era of budgetary constraint, in which the need to reduce the federal deficit is forcing
fundamental choices, many people may behave as Heritage Foundation critic Laurence Jarvik
observed twenty years ago, “Whenever American families have to make cuts in their spending,
nonessential spending -- such as entertainment expenses -- are the first to go” (Jarvik, 1997, p.
11). Public librarians point out that Americans feel safe in making these personal sacrifices,
secure in the knowledge that they can turn to public libraries to bridge the gap by providing free
access to movies, the Internet, books, periodicals, and programs, including live performances, in
the interim.
Despite the setbacks described, modern-day libraries have to take a participatory
approach to learning and creating, with the aim of making both the learning that goes on
in the library...so much more relevant to learners. The library should always strive to be
the beating heart of the ... learning community...offering...opportunities to move from

3

simply being users and consumers to being creators by providing them with the space,
tools, and resources they need. Of course, the library is still a library -- its role as a place
to read, to research, to access information has not been supplanted...There is still a place
for that traditional role, of course, but the library today is a place where knowledge is
created and not merely consumed. So much of the learning that happens in the library
today...is the result of unhampered participation in a meaningful setting, just as Ivan
Illich (1971) suggested was a necessary condition for real learning nearly a half a century
ago. (Fleming, 2015, pp. 44-45)
Libraries are traditionally described as local information sources, community meeting
spaces, study zones, and connectors of people and information of all kinds. It is up to libraries,
already enmeshed in the makerspace movement as areas designed to allow users to create, build,
and learn new projects and technologies, to seek the next level in order to support lifelong
learning demands by Boomers. According to Nicole Baker Rosa of The Futures School, the
library user experience must become more experiential (Rosa, 2017). Libraries must move from
the role of passive collectors and consumers of information, to assume more active roles in
assisting in the creation of information.
Statement of the Problem
It is unknown how public libraries are meeting the lifelong learning goals of senior
learners. A review of Delaware public library programs focused on seniors for fiscal years 20152017 reveals a gap in services to this demographic. Delving into library professional literature
also reveals a large-scale gap in public libraries’ services to seniors.
Thousands of baby boomers celebrate retirement every day. The greying of the U.S.
baby boomers (which is occurring globally, as well) is a demographic revolution which drives
some of the most critical issues of our times. Approximately, “10,000 people will turn 65 every
day for the next 19 years. By 2030, at least 18% of the U.S. population will be 65 or over, and a
4

much higher percentage will be 50+” (Cohn & Taylor, 2010, para. 2). Thanks to general
improvements in the health of Americans over the course of the twentieth century, along with
advances in medicine and technology, the average life expectancy has increased by at least thirty
years (Schull, 2013, pp. xv-xvi). Public libraries must abandon the status quo in order to meet
the needs of senior learners.
Purpose of the Study
Public libraries are failing to serve the lifelong learning needs of seniors. This statement
is supported by a review of the public library programming for Delaware’s senior population
over the course of fiscal years 2015 through 2017. It is unknown how public libraries are
meeting the lifelong learning goals of the senior demographic.
Need of the study
Library professionals require a wake-up call: public libraries are failing to meet the
lifelong learning needs of the senior learners. Further, senior citizens, the fastest-growing
demographic in history, demand library services tailored to their lifelong learning needs, but
their demands remain largely unaddressed.
A review of the literature reveals two important gaps. First, there is no standard
terminology to describe the various types of senior populations. The general term, “seniors,”
encompasses “active adults,” “midlife adults,” “retirement age,” “baby boomers,” “50+
populations,” as well as other descriptors. The descriptors for a cultural center, particularly
when combined with a public library, are also varied. Secondly, the library profession has
neglected to prepare for the “aging of America.” There is very little published on how librarians
should prepare services, collections, programs, or buildings to better serve seniors. Few library

5

schools offer coursework in addressing the needs and expectations of seniors; none offer a
specialization in serving the senior demographic.
This paper has the potential to contribute to both theory and practice, and is important for
several reasons. First, the findings can assist stakeholders in developing programs, services, and
collections that support the enrichment, education, and experiences of individuals, teams, and
leaders. This could expand the organizational effectiveness of libraries as lifelong learning
centers and support the growth of libraries as learning institutions.
Second, this study could increase the opportunities and outcomes for transformative
learning in developing change initiatives, program designs, adult education programs, teaching
methods, and related self-help, support, and network groups.
Third, this study can provide direction in reshaping the public library as a center for
positive aging. The changes taking place in library services for older adults are driven by one of
the largest demographic and social transformations in United States history -- the aging of
America's population. Senior citizens will play an increasingly dominant role in American
society, including public libraries. With this knowledge in mind, it is important to plan for and
to consider the different outcomes that this issue raises.
Research Question
Research Question. How can public libraries bridge the gap to best serve senior
citizens’ lifelong learning needs?
In examining this question, this study reviews public library services for seniors pursuing
lifelong learning. The study also recognizes and addresses a gap in the professional training,
terminology, and services in public libraries with regard to this demographic.

6

Focus of Study
The results of the literature review, combined with the results of a review of three years
of Delaware public libraries’ senior-center programming, yielded an unexpected result: Senior
citizens’ lifelong learning needs are not being met through public libraries in Delaware…or
nationwide. It is unknown how public libraries can bridge this gap to best serve senior citizens’
lifelong learning needs.
The aging population has transformed politics, retirement systems, health systems,
welfare systems, labor markets, banking, stock markets, and even the arts and has had a profound
impact on how leisure time is spent. The seventy-eight million North Americans born from 1946
to 1964 are retiring younger, living longer, and make more demands regarding quality of life
than previous generations. It is time to encourage out-of-the-box thinking, creative expansion of
existing institutions, and consider innovative approaches to effectively address the challenges.
Creating bold, new paradigms takes vision. As a generation known for its willingness to break
with social norms and traditions, it is not surprising that as the baby boomers reflect on and
possibly reconceptualize their identities, core beliefs, values, roles, goals, and behaviors, they
reshape and change the experience of day-to-day reality. Toni Gavey, director of the Phoenix
(Arizona) Public Library and cochair of the newly formed Maricopa County Commission on Age
stated: “Retirement is changing, so we need to evolve to support that change” (Schull, 2013, p.
xvi).

Chapter II
Analysis of Current Practice
Introduction
The literature review provided baseline evidence of a gap in library professional literature
regarding services for senior citizens. A review of programs offered to Delaware seniors via
public libraries over the course of fiscal years 2015 through 2017 underscored the existing gap in
services to seniors. Finally, this research sought to provide a basis for recommendations that
proactively supports seniors’ lifelong learning and improves their quality of life, while enhancing
libraries’ value. How can public libraries bridge this gap to best serve senior citizens’ lifelong
learning needs?
Search and Inclusion Criteria
Articles were located through the Wilmington University Library EBSCOhost and
ProQuest search engines. EBSCOhost databases used included Academic Search Premier,
Education Research Complete, ERIC, Humanities International Complete, Library, Information
Science and Technology Abstract (LISTA), PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and SocINDEX.
ProQuest’s Digital Dissertations database was also used. Searching consisted of toggling
between Google, the library, and arts resources to drill down through authoritative journals.
Books were used extensively and were obtained through the Delaware Library Catalog,
Worldcat, Wilmington University Library, and through Interlibrary Loan.
In reviewing the literature, most of the pertinent research of lifelong learning in libraries
relates to informal learning and makerspace. Literature in the field of librarianship, between the
years of 2005 to 2011 reflects a new awareness and response to the emergence of a new life
stage, a period between full-time work and parenthood, and the onset of frailty and dependency

8

toward the end of life. Adults in this life stage did not seem to fit the profession’s traditional
definitions of “seniors.” Schull (2013) coined the term “midlife adults” to address this age
group.
All public libraries in Delaware are members of a consortium that operates under the
overview of the Delaware Division of Libraries (DDL). To encourage equity and uniformity of
public library services, this consortium shares resources, such as an online catalog, uniform
circulation, cataloging software, and an online calendar of events supported by Evanced
software. The information available via the Evanced calendar is self-reported by libraries
statewide. A review of programs intended for seniors spanned three years: fiscal years 2015,
2016, and 2017. Key terms included seniors, all locations, and all event types.
Components/Tools
Re-imagining the public library as an experiential center for lifelong learning,
fuses two critical aspects of life today; on one hand, it draws upon the innately human
desire to make things with our hands and our brains, using tools, some of which we have
used since the dawn of history, using materials provided by nature and by science, and
using language too. And on the other hand, it draws inspiration from the broadest range
of activities from across the digital sphere. (Fleming, 2015, p. 2)
Examining facets of lifelong learning as applied to seniors in a library setting may reveal a new
course for future librarianship.
Tools are the expression of the man and his environment interaction and the way, means,
and consequences of that action and how they are adapted to each other. When a center for
seniors’ lifelong learning is established in public libraries, the product will ensue that the
collections, tools, services, and programs are offered in that space. For example, “unbelievable
artwork and materials created by talented hands come from [centers] that have potter’s wheels,

9

soldering, and looms” (Burke, 2014, p. 3). The creative outpouring described in the previous
sentence is dependent on the availability of the three tools the center has to make available:
potter’s wheels, soldering, and looms.
Dewey’s understanding of tools went far beyond tangible objects. He recognized
personal attributes, an organized community, shared ideas, organizations, and social institutions
as part of the technological arts that we deploy in our interactions with each other. The most
important of them all, for Dewey, was language -- he calls it “the tool of tools” (Dewey, 1934, p.
298). “They shape collective occupations and thus determine direction of interest and attention,
and hence affect desire and purpose” (Dewey, 1934, p. 345).
Potentially, public libraries would be designed with the capabilities to accommodate the
exploration of music, dance, theatre, film, photography, visual, and literary arts with users
participating not just as passive audience participants, but also by participating actively in their
own learning with the librarian assuming the role of a partner, a guiding influence, in the
process.
“Our means of communication, going beyond merely the spoken and written word, are
critical to our capacity as human beings to cooperate with each other, learn from each other,
work with each other, and live effectively with each other” (Fleming, 2015, p. 3).
New research in the field of education, and theories, such as multiple intelligences and
different “ways of knowing,” has also fueled interest in lifelong learning. Theoretical
developments have helped build appreciation for the different ways adults learn,
including informal learning, peer learning, experiential learning, and free-choice or selfdirected learning. At the same time, the current pace of technological change is a major
driver of change in the educational environment. Older adults, as well as young people,
now have an expanded array of tools, approaches, and environments for learning, all of
which are influencing approaches to learning across the lifespan. (Schull, 2013, p. 220)

10

A public library serving as the center for lifelong learning is rooted in the idea of a
“Participatory Culture,” a term coined by American media scholar Henry Jenkins (Jenkins,
Purushotma, Weigel, Clinton, & Robison, 2009). According to Jenkins et al. (2009),
“participatory culture shifts the focus of literacy from one individual expression to community
involvement” (p. 7). Jenkins (2009) recognized the key elements of a participatory culture as:
Low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and
sharing one’s creations with others, some type of informal mentorship whereby what is
known by the most experienced is passed along to novices, where members believe their
contributions matter, and where members feel some degree of social connection with one
another. (p. 7)
That core idea of sharing one’s creations is also reminiscent of something that Ivan Illich
(1973) wrote in Tools for Conviviality:
Tools are intrinsic to social relationships. An individual relates himself in action to his
society through the use of tools that he actively masters or by which he is passively acted
on. To the degree that he masters his tools, he can invest the world with his meaning. (p.
34)
Illich encouraged use of “convivial tools,” that is, “those that offer each of us
opportunities to enrich our environment with fruits of our own vision” (p. 34). Such tools are
quite different from the passive tools that render us as “consumers of their output, as recipients
of meaning determined by others, and that deny us the power to use our own creativity to
construct our own meaning in life” (Fleming, 2015, p. 7). Schull (2013) concurs, “Passive
entertainment is giving way to participatory programming and peer-led activities that change the
relationship between librarians and midlife patrons, and ultimately, engage the patrons more
substantively in the life of the library” (pp. xvii-xviii).

11

There is no one model for what works best. There are as yet no templates for projects or
blueprints for institutional change. At one end of the spectrum is an increase in the marketing of
current programs to draw in midlife adults; at the other end are system-wide initiatives affecting
staffing, programs, communications, and resource allocations. Librarians committed to 50+
services need to avoid preconceived notions about their older patrons and focus on building a
broad portfolio of offerings. Kathleen Mayo, who is nationally recognized for her many years in
outreach services at the Lee County (Florida) Library System, summed up the challenge in her
2009 Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture: “Thinking of people as a broad age group can
be misleading. In fact, they are identified more by their interests and abilities than their ages”
(para. 11). To refine the public library’s “portfolio” the senior community should be encouraged
to provide feedback through surveys, focus groups, advisory councils, and other methods. The
following list is by no means comprehensive, but may serve as a useful tool to springboard
discussion.
Music: Tools to consider when supplementing the music module of the public library as a
lifelong learning center are a recording studio, or laboratories for electronic piano instruction.
Classes in folk instruments (guitar, dulcimer, recorder, pennywhistle, and others) could be
accommodated. Sound-proofed rooms might provide practice space for aspiring musicians or
small musical ensembles. Artist residencies would be encouraged. An American Sign Language
(ASL) Choir could be hosted in this space as could other choral, instrumental, chamber, and solo
performers and performances. Cabarets could showcase samplings of musicals, operas, and
operettas. An auditorium or audion or a collapsible stage would facilitate practices and
performances.

12

Dance: Studios created to accommodate dance classes would ideally include appropriate
flooring and mirrors, but it is also possible to accommodate dance classes with a moveable floor
and/or mirrors. Classes could be offered to explore a variety of dance styles (traditional, ballet,
jazz, tap, and social) while embracing healthy lifestyle choices. Regional dance companies could
showcase talent and provide insight to upcoming events/performances. Master classes might
appeal to students at local studios or schools/colleges. A monthly social dance could offer
entertainment, as well as a showcase for a variety of dance styles from hip-hop to swing to
country line-dancing. An annual event could showcase innovative original choreography and
nascent regional talent, while nurturing collaboration between studios. Informative lectures
could range from dance history to healthy dancer diet/lifestyle.
Theatre: In addition to enrichment opportunities offered through performances by
itinerant/touring and/or regional drama organizations (including community theatre and school
drama departments), acting workshops, and festivals would provide a showcase for audiences to
experience and appreciate a variety of dramatic styles. The library could establish a “Readers
Theatre” troupe. Introducing annual playwriting contests, similar to the annual “One Act Play”
contest sponsored by the Wilmington (Delaware) Drama League would introduce new material
to performers and audiences.
Film and photography: Acquiring tools to create animation, and providing cameras, a
green screen, and training would encourage the study and exploration of film and photography.
Gallery exhibits of “student” and professional work, as well as large and small screens with
appropriate projectors and film licenses, would facilitate screenings of new work, as well as film
series and events. For example, the cultural center could host an annual “Canned Film” Festival

13

featuring original regional and local films. Current trends suggest that tools to learn to use and
manipulate virtual reality and artificial intelligence should be considered.
Visual: There are many types of visual arts: drawing, painting in a variety of mediums,
calligraphy, textiles, ceramics, sculpture, prints, and more. The tools that could support this
module range from pencils and paper to potter’s wheels or 3-D printers. Librarians who have
welcomed makerspaces into their buildings will agree that creativity and innovation are
unlimited even with limited resources. This module lends itself readily to receptions, exhibits,
maker workshops, speakers, and artists-in-residencies. An ambitious project would be to launch
juried exhibits and/or launch an annual regional arts festival after the style of the Central
Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts.
Literary: Reading has been described as the ultimate “free choice” learning experience,
whether reading alone, in groups, or online. Book discussions, author visits, writing workshops,
NaNoWriMo (National Novel-Writing Month, i.e., November), summer/winter reading
programs, storytelling swaps, literacy initiatives (such as P.A.W.S., M.A.R.K., 1000 Books
Before Kindergarten, and the Dolly Parton Library project), conferences/retreats, author
showcases, One Book/One Community programs, and writing contests fit easily into libraries’
traditional roles. A cultural center could push the envelope here by offering on-demand printing
and binding equipment, hosting a virtual e-zine to showcase local/regional work, or an annual
author showcase or book festival which had regional draw, developing book review “vlogs,”
hosting a writers critique group, or embracing efforts to ePublish their users’ writing projects.
Public libraries serving as lifelong learning centers could “also tie in to the growing trend of
indie artists in every medium – including books – who are bypassing traditional gatekeepers,

14

taking advantage of new tools to produce professionally polished products, and going direct to
the web to seek an audience” (Britton, 2012, p. 21).
Librarians may choose to combine general adult services and specific services for 50+
adults. Some may have both inclusive and specific programs. Programs marketed to general
adult audiences attract high numbers of midlife adults, despite the lack of targeting, marketing,
or scheduling. For instance, Karen Hansen at the Evanston (Illinois) Public Library, a coorganizer of “Ulysses, Mission Impossible,” said when interviewed, that she never “intended the
program especially for 50+ adults; however, they make up by far the majority of participants”
(Schull, 2013, p. 225). Still others may choose to take an intergenerational approach, mindful of
the important connections to be made between youth and senior constituents, such as
grandchildren and grandparents. Systemic 50+ programs with visibility, resources, and library
support involve dedicated staff, programming, and branding. Librarians will need to step up
marketing to attract midlife adults to their programs. All modules could further expand their
potential audiences via the Internet/World Wide Web, or via social media.
From all these possibilities, it becomes apparent that there are two key aspects that must
be addressed: knowledge sharing (formal and informal/unstructured) and tool sharing (from
potter’s wheels to 3-D printers). Knowledge sharing is supported through a library’s collections
(books, movies, technology, tools, and so on), services, and programs. Through hands-on
learning and exploration, participants will learn how to use a particular technique, tool, or
technology. This learning need not follow guidelines as formal as a public school’s curriculum
and should allow for discovery through exploration and creation. Opportunities to collaborate
must also be incorporated; the community and individuals benefit from working with others on
projects, or from working on separate projects, but in the same place. By creating in an

environment which encourages formal instruction, as well as reactions and input about the
creative process from others, the library will fuel inspiration and lifelong learning.
A public library is a community hub “where the mingling of multiple creative minds and
their respective talents can inspire innovation” (Burke, 2014, p. 3). The components of a
successful center for lifelong learning for seniors could encompass many features. There is no
set list of content standards to align with to ensure the needs of residents are met. In order to
determine the components of a successful transformation, the library will need to establish
benchmarks and identify best practices tailored to its customer base. A list of arts venues and
their programs should be compiled with an eye to cultivating potential community partners and
stakeholders. This tool would also identify core programs and disciplines. The disciplines
supported by the public library as a center for seniors’ lifelong learning will need the input of
community partners and focus groups to determine how programs, services, and materials will
meet seniors’ demands and expectations regarding lifelong learning.
Sadly, a comprehensive listing such as the one described in the previous paragraph does
not exist. In Delaware, the Delaware Division of Arts maintains a list of arts venues for its
online events calendar, “Delaware Scene,” (Delaware Division of the Arts, 2017), and an artist
roster (State of Delaware, 2017), but these tools only reflect participating organizations or artists;
neither of these resources is comprehensive.
Demographics
The greatest demographic transformation in human history driven by baby boomers born
between 1946 to 1964, impacts every aspect of society. This burgeoning senior demographic is
experiencing a longer lifespan than previous generations, coupled with improved population
health. It has clearly influenced libraries, from the smallest rural libraries to the largest urban

16

systems. “In fact, it is astonishing that in the face of such a transformation there has not been
more attention paid by the library profession” (Schull, 2013, p. ix). The library community must
address how it can best serve this diverse community that continues to grow in size. It is time to
reshape the public library as a center for positive aging and lifelong learning.
Thanks to general improvements in the health of Americans over the course of the
twentieth century, along with advances in medicine and technology, average life
expectancy has increased by at least thirty years. Not only are there more adults in their
seventies, eighties, and nineties, but they are healthier, more mobile, and more civically
and socially engaged than prior generations of “seniors.” Many are living vigorous lives
well into their nineties, continuing to earn, to learn, to create, and to contribute. For
many 50+ adults, positive aging is related to the extent to which they feel purposeful and
involved in a group or community. They want to “give back,” do something meaningful,
and stay civically engaged. They prompt reconsideration of such fundamental questions
as “What is old?” “What is retirement?” and “How do I live a meaningful life?” (Schull,
2013, p. xvi)
Reviewed by Race and ethnicity, the U.S. Census of 2010 reveals the percentage of Kent
County’s population to be “White: 67.8, Black: 24; American Indian 0.6; Asian, 2; Pacific
Islander 0.1. Only 9,346 people identified as Hispanic or Latino; the remaining 152,964 were
not Hispanic or Latino” (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010, “Population Finder”).

The public library serving as a lifelong learning center needs to reflect the interests of the
community in which it operates. A balance must be struck wherein the library meets existing
community needs for learning experiences while trying to motivate the rest of the community to
engage. The core programs, collections, and services must match what is certain to be used, but
there should still be opportunities available that will make people curious and draw them in.
Some librarians attended the Libraries for the Future Lifelong Access Libraries Leadership
Institute, which was held for three years (2006 - 2008) at the University of North Carolina.
18

Institute fellows gained new perspectives on aging, learned about changes taking place in
other professions, and shared ideas about how to transform library services to help
boomers through midlife transitions and unexpected “bonus years.” These forwardthinking professionals recognized the potential for libraries to position themselves as
essential centers for learning, creativity, encore careers, and community engagement.
(Schull, 2013, p. viii)
Public libraries:
…Are starting to reshape services for 50+ adults, also known as midlife adults. With the
blessing of library leaders, new sources of support and positive responses from their
patrons, many imaginative librarians are working toward change. They are testing new
approaches to programs, projects, staffing, collections, communications, and
partnerships. Some are even revising long-term plans or reshuffling priorities to
incorporate goals for meeting the needs of, and working with, midlife adults. In fact, so
many libraries are engaged in this process of change that they represent a new movement,
a movement affecting the scope, organization, and content of services and programs for
midlife and other active older adults. (Schull, 2013, p. xv)
The future is here, it is just not evenly distributed! Services for 50+ adults are still being
developed in isolation without established benchmarks to determine the effectiveness of their
impact.
Libraries engage and involve people: the people who are intrigued by the arts, the people
who come to programs, the people who support creative efforts, and the people who are likely to
use the services and collections of a library and/or lifelong learning center. Understanding
lifelong learning’s appeal to seniors in a library’s community and helping them build a center for
sharing their explorations and learning from each other is an intuitive expansion of a library’s
mission.

19

With insight and commitment, transforming public libraries into successful lifelong
centers for seniors will provide instructive models of change to other libraries statewide, and
even nationally. As a result of these developments, a new movement will emerge, a movement
that portends restructuring of library services and promises new relationships between libraries
and the constituents they serve. Today, that movement is still in its infancy. The changes taking
place are decentralized, uneven, and sometimes imperceptible even to library colleagues and
patrons. Collectively, there is evidence of institutional and professional change (Schull, 2013).
Professional Development
“The public library’s present-day tools, models, and processes are quickly becoming
relics…something fundamental has changed” (Rosa, 2017, para. 2)! The public library model
established more than 100 years ago isn’t nearly as effective as it once was. Over the course of
my thirty-year professional library career, I have experienced the challenges firsthand: increased
competition for market share, more competition for users’ time, and shrinking revenue sources.
Rapid advances in technology have driven increased expectations from users and forced libraries
to accept irreversible trends: Wi-Fi/Internet access, social media, eBooks, and streaming videos.
Today’s libraries are in a race for relevance. The pace is fast and libraries are at risk of falling
seriously behind. Worse, some are likely to drop out of the race altogether.
It is important to plan for and to consider the different outcomes that the aging of the
population raises. It affects libraries and creates unforeseen stresses on these facilities and other
support systems that surround the elderly. Despite the evidence for change, there are still
barriers to achieving transformation of library services for aging populations. Ageism is one of
these barriers. As Robert Butler so vividly described in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book Why
Survive: Being Old in America (2002), Americans are acculturated to think negatively about the

20

aging process. The concept of old age as a time of deficit and dependency is reinforced from
childhood on (Butler, 2002, p. xii). A common assumption is that there is little to learn, create,
or contribute after the years of parenting and/or paid employment end (Butler, 2002, p. xii).
These attitudes are difficult to eradicate, even when the diversity, productivity, and societal
benefits of people 50+ are increasingly visible (Schull, 2013, xix).
Classifying all older adults as “seniors” and including them along with “the underserved”
in the service category known as “special populations,” reinforces ageism by librarians, who may
view such seniors as beyond the sphere of regular adult programming.
Libraries’ traditional organizational structures reflect the categorization of older adults, or
seniors, as special populations that are served through an outreach department. Most
libraries relegate senior services to outreach staffs who concentrate on book deliveries to
homebound elderly, deposit collections, and programming at senior centers and senior
housing. There are few mechanisms to link these services within library services and
programs that are attracting a higher and higher proportion of 50+ residents who are
seeking options for work, learning, and service. (Schull, 2013, pp. xx-xxi)
Bleiberg-Seperson and Hegeman (2008) offer two social theories regarding aging. The
first, the disengagement theory, states that “it is natural and expected for older people to give up
different social roles, interests, and activities as they age” (p. 65). Society participates in this
disengagement, as it encourages younger, more energetic people to take over. This theory
reinforces the various stereotypes related to ageism in society today.
By contrast, the authors also put forward the activity theory. This approach supports
“continued social interaction and productivity are essential to a sense of well-being and life
satisfaction in old age” (Bleiberg-Seperson & Hegeman, 2008, p. 65). Social interaction is
believed to assist in guiding individuals through the aging process successfully. It seems logical
that embracing some engagement as individuals age is more beneficial than no interaction at all.
21

Training to support informal learning programs for 50+ adults is not systemic or widely
available to librarians. Some librarians have turned to professional development opportunities
addressing life transitions and the principles of adult learning offered to educators and health and
wellness experts. Key principles of adult learning include: (1) organizing learning in groups and
including a social component; (2) offering opportunities for individual expression and group
dialogue; (3) introducing program participants to complementary library resources for further
independent learning’; and (4) providing options in program formats and schedules (Schull,
2013, p. 223).
Libraries have specialists to address the programming, collection, and service needs of
preschoolers, juveniles, tweens, teens, young adults, and adults.
But given libraries’ existing structures, these midlife adults are not the responsibility of
any particular staff person, department, or program. They are relatively invisible and are
usually lumped together with other adults and offered services and programs that may or
may not be pertinent to their transitional issues and life stage. (Schull, 2013, pp. xx-xxi)
Therefore, it is logical that librarians will eventually need to establish departments and prepare
staff to serve people wherever they are on their lifelong timeline.
There is a gap in formal training in library services for seniors. The majority of
American Library Association (ALA) accredited library schools do not offer library education
courses or certification programs in services to seniors. “Today there are at most four courses in
the nation’s library and information graduate schools that are dedicated to or include midlife
services” (Schull, 2013, p. xxi). Professional development opportunities, such as webinars on
older adult services by state libraries or Webjunction are sporadic. Irregularly scheduled
workshops or programs on older adult services are offered at state and national library

22

association conferences. “None of these offer certification; none of them lead to specialization
or status within the profession” (Schull, 2013, p. xxii).
Schull (2013) identified two notable exceptions to this situation: the Lifelong Access
Libraries Institute organized by Libraries for the Future in conjunction with the University of
North Carolina’s School of Information, and the recently completed IMLS-funded Western
States Fellowship program led by the California State Library and involving partnerships with
five state libraries plus the Pacific Library Partnership. The programs are no longer operative;
currently there is no vehicle for in-depth face-to-face professional development (Schull, 2013,
pp. xxi-xxii).
Language Barriers
Language hampers and exacerbates the challenge of professional development.
Librarians seeking to expand their work with midlife adults have yet to reach consensus on the
appropriate term for 50+ or midlife adults.
Should they be considered younger seniors? Should they all be lumped together as
boomers, even though some are younger and some are older than the strictly year-defined
boomer? Are they mature adults, as opposed to frail elderly? Is there a term that can
embrace both multiple generations and multiple types of people? These questions reflect
the societal changes taking place and the need to convert new thinking about older adults
into new language within the profession. (Schull, 2013, pp. xxii-xxiii)
The default term for many librarians for an older adult is “senior.”
This has special connotations in the library setting, implying someone who is dependent,
infirm, or isolated; who requires outreach services; and who can no longer contribute to
community life. In fact, this term contradicts the realities faced by librarians every
day...These adults do not need books delivered to them; they are eager to deliver the
books themselves, organize programs, write press releases, design websites, create
events, and also show up for the library’s morning yoga class. They are not “seniors;”
23

they are part of a new population cohort that has yet to find the right name. (Schull,
2013, p. xxiii)
As the field is still emerging, there is little available in terms of research or systematic
evaluation. Documentation of services and programs for “seniors” may also be referred to as
“Baby Boomers,” “Active Older Adults,” “Adults 50+,” “50+ Services,” “Mid-life adults,” and a
host of other descriptors. The lack of consistent terminology makes capturing the landscape of
projects, programs, and initiatives that document librarians’ responses to the aging American
population challenging.
Public libraries serving rural areas and small towns represent almost four-fifths of all
public library systems in the United States. In an amazing infrastructure that spreads across
wide-open spaces with relatively low populations, these important (in many small communities,
the public library is the only cultural institution in town, as well as the only point of public
access to communication and information technology), but often overlooked institutions struggle
to provide services similar to their urban and suburban counterparts even though they often face
higher poverty levels, lower literacy rates, and less availability of goods and services (Heuertz,
Gordon, Gordon, & Moore, 2003).
The economic downturns of the 1980s and early 2000s exacerbated these struggles as has
the increasingly diverse nature of many rural communities. “Some have figured out, or are in the
process of figuring out, how to be community players rather than just library advocates,” a
distinction drawn by the late Betty Jane Narver, formerly a trustee of the Seattle Public Library
and chair of the executive board of the Urban Libraries Council, and prompted by Eleonor Jo
Rodger, former president and CEO of the Urban Libraries Council (Rodger, 2002, p. 53). As
Rodger describes it, “Advocates go out into the community and say ‘library, library, library.’

24

Players go out, listen, and then say ‘economic development, child safety, literacy.’ Here’s how
we can help” (Rodger, 2002, p. 53). Public libraries are, in essence, doing community-building
activities. It is this work that informs the creation of public libraries as cultural and community
centers.
All effective librarians today must acknowledge that they are also lifelong learners.
“Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient,
continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each
other” stated educator/philosopher Paulo Freire (Fleming, 2015, p. 5). For a public library to
serve as a lifelong learning center, librarians must be able to say to their users, we are all learners
now, let’s learn together! We are all creators now, let’s create together!
To be effective, staff must focus on practices that will lead to connected experiences that
help maximize the value of innovating and also create toolsets to enhance learning experiences
that empower and equip users with necessary skills to effectively produce and consume content
across a variety of media platforms. Staff must be driven to enable customers by applying
innovative methods and cutting edge technology. Unfortunately, many libraries are traditiondriven, slow to change, and risk averse. Stakeholders expect value and demand return for their
investments. Online competitors offer programs and services that were once the sole purview of
libraries. Technology offers a plethora of alternatives and unlimited immediate access to
products and services. The diverse and conflicting interests of library users reflect a variety of
needs and expectations which creates a growing gap with each successive generation.

25

Academics and Lifelong Learning
As America ages, retirees seek to hone old skills or develop new ones, pursuing longpostponed intellectual or artistic interests and seeking new formal and informal learning
opportunities.
The market for older adult learning is such that community colleges and universities are
opening their doors to students in their fifties and sixties, creating satellite campuses,
flexible schedules, and special tracks or cohort groups to attract older adults…The
number of college students’ ages 40-64 has jumped by almost 20 percent to nearly 2
million in the past decade. (Schull, 2013, p. 221)
Librarians should take notice of this trend. The growing interest in formal and informal
learning feeds into the public library’s role as a gateway to learning. The gateway role, in which
the public library offers information on learning opportunities in the community, resources for
self-directed learning, and access to online learning, is not new.
Lifelong learners do not fit a single profile. Each lifelong learner brings a different set of
motivations and expectations to the table. To enhance the learning journey of these self-directed
students, some librarians are taking more active roles in promoting libraries’ potential as “centers
for lifelong learning” (Schull, 2013, p. 222).
These librarians see the importance of moving beyond information services and
community connections to offer on-site educational programs relevant to the needs,
backgrounds, and interests of midlife adults….They see the value of the library as a
community setting in which different kinds of learning can occur. As a result, these
librarians are providing 50+ adults with a wide variety of learning services, including
options in subject matter, medium, expertise available, and program structure. They offer
many instructive examples, from traditional program formats, such as topical book clubs,
language instruction, and weekly film programs to less traditional activities. (Schull,
2013, pp. 222-223)

26

Very little has been published on public libraries expanding into seniors’ lifelong centers
or public libraries’ pedagogical backgrounds in particular. Much of the literature on pedagogy is
drawn from similarly based projects in magnet/charter schools, other libraries (academic,
special), or community arts/cultural centers. Still, the Institute of Museum and Library Services
stated that “all libraries and museums – and the people they serve – stand to benefit from
becoming more intentional and purposeful about accommodating the lifelong learning needs of
people in the 21st century” (Semmel & IMLS, 2009, p. 22).
Currently, libraries tend to:
Emphasize access to the arts rather than creation and expression. No matter the quality,
the performances, readings, exhibitions, or demonstrations are primarily passive
experiences that do not encourage active participation....To take full advantage of the
library as a center for creative expression and to support positive aging in their
communities effectively; librarians must shift their perspective about older adults. They
must see them as creators as well as consumers. (Schull, 2013, p. 184)
Fortunately there are several organizations that are leaders in arts education for elders.
According to the National Center for Creative Aging (2012), their mission states it fosters an
understanding of the vital relationship between creative expression and positive aging. The
National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) also encourages arts education for older adults; in 2007,
Thomas and Lyles and the NEA published Creativity and Aging: Best Practices. The New York
State Council on the Arts (2004) expanded its arts education guidelines beyond K-12 to include
“lifelong learning.” Lifetime Arts, a national organization in Westchester, New York, focuses on
libraries sites for creative aging; Lifetime Arts partnered with the Westchester Library System,
the New York Public Library, and Brooklyn Public Library to develop demonstration projects
before expanding to other libraries nationwide (Schull, 2013).
27

Caudron (2004) stated that “free agent learners” pursue continuing education to achieve
personal development goals (Moore, 2014a, p. 22). These lifelong learners resemble the original
patrons of programs like Elderhostel, providing residential short courses for older learners since
1976 (and today operating as Road Scholar), and Osher Lifelong Learning Institute programs on
campuses throughout the United States (Road Scholar, n.d.; University of Washington, 2017). In
Kent County, the University of Delaware offers a tuition-free completion program for Delaware
residents over the age of sixty (University of Delaware, 2017).
Vaill (1996) emphasized the need for continuous learning in “permanent white water” (p.
10) and suggested that individuals must be extremely effective learners in order to change with
the times. Many leaders have also suggested that the stress, uncertainty, and need for flexibility
in today’s world will only continue to grow. Thus, it is essential to support development of
adults’ abilities to adapt and thrive in this turbulent environment.
As with other types of institutional and professional change, the emergence of 50+ library
services is not a dramatic transformation but rather a gradual evolution in attitudes and practices
(Schull, 2013, p. 22). Over the years, education in public schools has resulted in generations of
passive learners. Many leaders in history were self-directed informal learners before the
introduction of public schooling (Collins, 2006). One possible explanation for learner passivity
today is – “they have been socialized by years of experience in formal education into a passive
role, and do not associate learning with a more active posture…” (Candy, 1991, p. 392; Norman,
2011). Partnerships with schools (public, private, colleges and universities, homeschoolers,
charters, and magnet) are desirable. Many libraries offer certificate programs and continuing
education courses required in various professions. Libraries can be a key resource for the

28

professional community. But these collaborations would enjoy even more success if courses
were more engaging and experiential, and included a social component.
Public libraries should encourage educators to collaborate in creating a participatory and
experiential learning culture, which ties into current research on the plasticity of the adult brain
and the potential for older adult learning.
There is a growing body of evidence that the human brain is not static, even in the older
years. It is continually responsive to input, and activities that engage both sides of the
brain, such as memory work, creative expression, learning new routines, movements, and
ways of seeing which seem to have physiological, as well as psychological benefits
during the aging process. It is not surprising, then, that arts programs, especially
participatory programs, seem to be beneficial during aging. (Schull, 2013, p. 182)
Burke (2014) postulates that in a creative, collaborative culture, such as the one that
public libraries serving as lifelong learning centers would encourage, there is an educational
impact that a person gains from the act of creating. The community provides an instructional
role for participants to learn from other participants. Dougherty (2013) offers that in this culture,
students are taught the participatory mind-set, creating best practices for teaching skills and
techniques. “What is made may not matter at all; it can still influence the thought process,
vision, and ability to connect a learn[er]” (Burke 2014, p. 2). The benefit of collaboration places
students in the role of teacher, giving them venues to examine and explain their practices. This
leads to better comprehension by students, placing tools in the hands of the learner and
encouraging lifelong study.
One of the most influential studies on the effects of lifelong learning was carried out by
Dr. Gene Cohen (2006), former director of the Center on Aging, Health, and Humanities at
George Washington University. Cohen examined whether and how continuous learning,

29

especially participatory arts programs, has a positive influence on the well-being of older adults.
His 2006 landmark report, “The Creativity and Aging Study: The Impact of Professionally
Conducted Cultural Programs in Older Adults” affirmed that structured arts education has
positive social, psychological, and cognitive impacts, as well as physical benefits.
Some gerontologists and advocates of positive aging are seeking methods for engaging
more adults in lifelong learning activities, particularly in the arts. They are encouraging
arts educators to work more seriously with aging adults, revitalizing aging services, and
senior centers through arts programming, and identifying public spaces, such as libraries
that offer natural opportunities for creative aging programs. (Schull, 2013, pp. 181-182)
Forming continuing education partnerships, libraries are in a unique position to build
connections throughout the community. They act as conveners, linking academic faculty with
community members/organizations to address specific issues, such as community professional
development for nonprofit organizations, and, thereby, transform the communities served by
these groups. Lifelong learning opportunities for personal and professional enhancement are
also available through university extension programs. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 established
the national cooperative extension system, comprised of extension units at each of the fifty landgrant universities established under the Morrill Act of 1862. Extension professionals are
employed by the University of Delaware and placed in every county of the state to provide
programming and services to the residents of that county. University extension contributes to
place-making by developing the capacity of individuals and community organizations to
accomplish goals together (Civittolo & Davis, 2011). Extension professionals play an important
role in building and supporting social networks linking university faculty with community
organizations and individual residents. The relationships that underlie these networks facilitate
identifying issues, exploring possible options to address the issues, building community support

30

for proposed solutions or programming, and establishing mutually beneficial, reciprocal
partnerships (Adedokun & Balschweid, 2009; Robinson & Meikle-Yaw, 2007).
Mental Wellness
“The best research confirms it: Americans are now perilously isolated” (Ilardi, 2009,
para. 1). In 2015, the National Science Foundation reported that unprecedented numbers of
Americans are lonely. Researchers cite cell phones, the Internet, television, fragmentation of the
nuclear family, longer work days, and commutes as sources of isolation. “In an era of instant
communication via cell phone and e-mail, some would argue that it doesn’t make sense that
people are lonely. Nevertheless, sharing – the antidote to loneliness – is not the same thing as
talking” (Crouse, 2014, para. 7). In a public library, lifelong learning is not practiced in
isolation; the public library is the hub for a community culture of engaged citizens who are
excited about learning and produces a positive environment for success and social interaction
though experiential lifelong learning.
Depression and social isolation affect one in seven people over 65 and there is increasing
recognition that social isolation adversely affects long-term health. Research indicates
that interventions, which promote active social contact, which encourage creativity, and
which use mentoring, are more likely to positively affect health and well-being. (Greaves
& Farbus, 2006, p. 134)
Library programs, whether face-to-face or in a virtual environment,
…Involve group activity and/or a sense of belonging to a group, with benefits flowing
not only to people involved in the production of art itself, but also to the many consumers
of the arts…afford possibilities for social contact. Insofar as these influences help
prevent individuals from slipping into social isolation, a clear health benefit is to be
expected. (Craemer, 2009, p. 6)

31

Indicative of this are the results of the only long-term study of arts attendance as
determinant of survival, a Swedish survey that tracked the health outcomes of 10,609 individuals
over 14 years (Konlaan, Bygren, & Johansson, 2000, p. 174). They found “a higher mortality
risk for those people who rarely visited informal learning venues, such as cinema, concerts,
museums, or art exhibitions compared with those visiting them most often, relative risks ranging
from 1.14 to 1.42 at 95% confidence levels” (Konlaan et al., 2000, p. 174).
Engaging in lifelong learning activities improves mental health. Researchers from the
University of Western Australia found that “those who spend at least two hours a week” engaged
in informal learning activities reported significantly “better mental well-being” (Davies,
Knuiman, & Rosenberg, 2016, p. 7). Attending a concert or gallery has the same effect as
singing, writing, or painting. Self-expression, creativity, enjoyment, and social inclusion
contribute to an individual’s well-being. While evidence of the benefits of lifelong learning
engagement has been on the rise since the 1990s, a study led by Davies et al. (2016) was the first
to determine a number regarding how much….engagement is need to contribute to positive
mental health.
Davies et al. (2016) stated that “good mental health is essential for individual and
community well-being” (p. 2). Arts engagement for the mentally-ill has been linked to “promote
improved confidence, self-esteem, and self-understanding” (p. 2). Davies et al. (2016) stated that
“In the elderly, such engagement can reduce depression, enhance self-worth, and promote
positive aging” (p. 2). Further, where population-based studies have been conducted, engaging
in informal learning, such as the arts has been associated with perceptions of happiness and stress
reduction (Davies, Knuiman, Wright, & Rosenberg, 2014; Michalos & Kahlke, 2010).

32

Looking at the impact that informal learning has on wellness through the lens of
economics; “mental illness costs America $193.2 billion in lost earnings per year” (Insel, 2008,
p. 664). Results from the 2015 SAMHSA NSDUH Mental Health findings show that “Nearly
one in five adults in the United States or 18.5% suffer from mental illness;” in 2015, an
“estimated 16.1 million American adults had at least one major depressive episode (6.7 percent
of the adult population)” (National Institute of Mental Health, 2016, para. 4). The figures
reported by the National Institute of Health did not include persons who reside in nursing homes
or long-term hospitals, so the figure for the senior population may be under-reported. These
figures are noted here in view of the possibility that some of the costs might be mitigated through
increased informal learning participation.
Intergenerational Programming
LaPorte (2004) reported that the gap between generations is getting wider between teens
and senior citizens. Young people do not interact with older adults in their families as children
in the past did. Many older adults live in age-segregated communities or alone. As a result
“loneliness and a decline in self-esteem among older adults, a decrease in children’s awareness
of their cultural and historical background, a fear of aging in the young, and an increase in
negative stereotypes of each age group for other” (LaPorte, 2004, p. 3) has developed. Public
libraries provide a forum in which young people and older adults can interact. Newman, Curtis,
and Stephens (2001) stated that intergenerational programs are “activities that increase
cooperation and exchange between any two generations” (p. 5). Typically, these programs
involve interactions between the young and old where there is sharing of skills, knowledge, and
experience” (LaPorte, 2004, p. 2).

33

One example of a successful intergenerational learning program is Elders Share the Arts
(ESTA, 2016) in Brooklyn, New York, which has been operating for over 25 years. To
transform life histories into works of arts, the staff of professionals creates a space where older
adults share their oral histories with younger community members. Together they work to create
art that interprets these histories in a variety of mediums: theater, murals, writing. The outcome
is a larger sense of community, with a corresponding increase in respect, tolerance, and
appreciation by exploring commonalities and differences through art (ESTA, 2016; LaPorte,
2004). Without the ESTA program, this increased empathy might not otherwise have existed.
Makerspace
“Geek” has come to mean “something one is passionate about” (Dictionary.com, 2017).
Out of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation campaign, “Geek Your Library” (Online
Community Library Center, 2013) grew Delaware’s “Inspiration Space” (Delaware Division of
Libraries, 2017a). All Delaware public libraries participate in the Delaware Division of
Libraries’ “Inspiration Space” program. This initiative embraces the MakerSpace movement.
Some detractors continue to question the wisdom of libraries investing scant resources in
new equipment and new initiatives that are outside many institutions’ realm of
expertise—and may ultimately prove to be a fad. Others, such as Tim Carrigan and Peter
Wardrip argue that offering the tools for hands-on learning and creative projects is a way
forward for libraries seeking to redefine their role in 21st-Century communities. The
latter view appears to be winning out, as evidenced by robust interest in School Library
Journal’s dedicated “Maker” issue and the popularity of Library Journal’s and School
Library Journal’s recent joint online Maker workshop. (Enis, 2015, para. 3)
Current best practices in library sciences show libraries evolving and becoming more
active community hubs through the “Makerspace” movement. In a library makerspace, patrons
of varying ages can work together, alone, or with library staff on creative projects. These spaces
34

often give community members access to tools, technology, and social connections that may not
be easily accessible otherwise. The goal of a makerspace is to allow library users to learn
through direct experimentation and from each other. Beginning around 2006, the “maker
movement” grew out of DIY culture. “The act of independent creation encourages return visits”
(Bagley, 2014, p. viii). Libraries took notice and began offering programs and redesigning
spaces to address related interests within their communities.
“The surge of interest in creating physical items with digital tools and Internet-shared
plans and techniques is known as the maker movement” (Burke, 2014, p. 11).
The motivation for offering a makerspace is to encourage a love of learning. In order to
do so successfully, the makerspace provider must first successfully identify a learning
style or mode to promote. For example, with hands-on learning and modeling, people
use a kinesthetic learning style. This is not a reliance on superior motor ability, but rather
a focus on one’s own speed by one’s own hands. Additionally, makerspaces encourage
collaborative learning that has a focus on interpersonal and small group skills, as well as
creating a sense of accountability. (Bagley, 2014, p. viii)
Burke (2014) concurs:
One thing that has changed the process of making from isolated, individual, small, or
focused group efforts has been the impact of collaboration among makers, often in a
single space. It can be a group of people working on individual iterations of a similar
type of project, or it can be individual artisans working with diverse media. The idea of
coworking is one in which two or more individuals are working in the same physical
space. They may be working on the same large project or on two or more different
projects, but they can turn to one another for advice and suggestions. (Burke, 2014, p.
11)
“Fundamentally, therefore, the Maker Movement is about moving from consumption to
creation and turning knowledge into action. In pedagogical terms, it is firmly located within the

35

broadly constructivist philosophies of education” (Fleming, 2015, p. 7). Makerspace projects
culminate in a physical product, which reinforces the movement’s strong ties with the theory of
constructionism pioneered by Seymour Papert.
Constructionism posits that while learners create mental models to help them learn,
actually creating a meaningful product strengthens their learning. Seeing that product or
the process of creating the product reveal a concept reinforces the student’s
understanding of that concept. This is often accomplished by the use of problem-based
learning exercises in which the student is given a problem to overcome that will teach her
or him about the subject being covered.
Problems are very much an expected part of maker activities. The driving force
of most maker projects is a desire to solve one or more problems while creating an object.
It seems like a natural fit to devise maker activities that teach or reinforce lessons for
students to learn. One example of how constructionism has directly influenced makers
and makerspaces is that there are a number of programming languages used in
makerspace workshops, including Scratch and Logo that were designed with
constructionist principles in mind. (Burke, 2014, p. 13)
Many makerspaces include technology like 3D printers, sewing machines, soldering
guns, coding, robotics, and wood carving machines where patrons are invited to experiment
freely. The purpose of a makerspace is often expressed as to be inspiring an interest in science,
technology, design, and life-long learning in the people who are served by the library. Over
time, it is expected that the available activities within each individual makerspace will grow to
reflect the interests of each community in which the library is housed.
Burke (2014) compiled a list (see Table 1) of the most common tools or creation options
available in library makerspaces from an informal 2013 survey of 109 library makerspaces.

Note. Adapted from “Makerspaces: A Practical Guide for Librarians,” by J. J. Burke, 2014, New
York, NY: Rowman and Littlefield.

Alongside and within the coworking and collaboration is a willingness to teach others.
Makers who share space do not necessarily share an equivalence of talent. People come
to the makerspace with a love for the creation of items and and of makers who may not
know as much as they do. The environment is typically one of shared equipment and
shared talents put to work on individual and shared creations. (Burke, 2014, p. 12)
Concurrently, participants may be creators, students, and instructors. The Maker
Movement parallels earlier programs that highlighted industrial arts and craftsmanship, but with

37

a special emphasis on informal learning. Quite elusive by nature and difficult to pin down, we
should nonetheless clarify that informal learning opportunities for our students can inspire
innovation and increase student performance in formal educational settings. As Eric Schmidt,
the former CEO of Google admits, “virtually everything new seems to come from the 20 percent
of their time they give to their engineers to spend on side projects” (Battelle, 2005, para. 5).
In many people’s minds, the Maker Movement in education is associated with STEMrelated concepts and technology-based activities. Many contemporary arts involve tools and
technology. To engage the community, the cultural center will need to provide access to these,
especially expensive specialty equipment that may be used by all.
One common theme…found among library learning centers and media centers using new
modes of teaching with technology was that learners require the space to discover and
learn on their own – and as they do this, they gain a higher degree of self-satisfaction.
(Carmichael, 2009, p. 55)
Digital literacy is increasingly become a much-needed skill for those who want to
become competent in the workforce. Building upon other forms of literacy, the aim is to
get users comfortable with digital technology – not so that they are experts in all
mediums, but rather so that they feel comfortable using new media as they approach it.
(Bagley, 2014, p. 28)
The Maker Movement encourages a growth mindset, which tolerates risk and failure and
maybe even encourages it. It is a truism that is nonetheless rarely acknowledged in
formal education that failure is a necessary step on the road to success and innovation. In
the words of developmental psychologist and philosopher, Jean Piaget, ‘When you teach
a child something you take away forever his chance of discovering it for himself.’
Learning through mistakes is very much encouraged. This seemingly novel but in fact
long-cherished approach to solving problems encourages our learners to try things they
are interested in or to develop unknown capabilities. Steve Jobs taught us all that making

38

mistakes and even failing can sometimes end up being the best things that ever happen to
you. (Fleming, 2015, pp. 9-10)
Makerspaces are also intended to allow minorities or underrepresented populations, like
women, senior citizens, or people with disabilities to become involved with technology and
fields they may not have previously considered. Research reveals that the three tenets of making
are sharing, creating, and participating. Libraries have an established tradition for sharing, but
until recently, may have lacked the last two.
Makerspaces encourage exploration, discovery, and problem-solving that result in a
physical product. Libraries encourage informal learning and support the internalization of
processes in users’ search for information. Both institutions are moving from consumption to
creation and turning knowledge into action, but as libraries transform into cultural centers, many
of the “products,” move from quantifiable output to qualitative, lifelong learning experiences.
Current educational practice reveals more emphasis on innovation, creative thinking, and
entrepreneurship (Volhoj & Dybdal, 2014). David Lankes, professor and dean’s scholar for New
Librarianship at Syracuse University, writes in The Atlas of New Leadership, “Librarianship is
not about artifacts, it is about knowledge and facilitating knowledge creation. So what should
we be spending our precious resources on? Knowledge creation tools, not the results of
knowledge creation” (Britton, 2012, p. 23).
Passion, skills, and creativity – Every business desires these traits; these are traits that
drive economic success. Exhibits, festivals, performances, workshops, master classes, artist
residencies, and more will improve the quality of life in service areas if libraries engaged in
enhancing lifelong learning for seniors and may prove to be important factors in attracting new
businesses, residents, and tourism for the region.

39

The current emphasis on amenities in libraries aligns with the new emphasis on livability
in community and urban planning for older adults. New or renovated libraries that are
deliberately designed as attractive and stimulating destinations for midlife adults can help to
strengthen the overall community infrastructure for an aging America.
The shift in libraries from restricted, staff-controlled spaces and services to more selfdirected environments aligns with the importance of independence, options, and self-directed
activities for healthy aging and has impact on seniors’ quality of life. Betty Turock, one of the
first library leaders to advocate increased attention to older adults, stated,
We know from studies that older adults' learning activities are largely independent, selfdirected, and self-paced. In the library, elders travel at their own pace, are joint planners
in their learning programs with librarians, assess their own needs and interests, and set
their own goals. (Schull, 2013, p. 302)
What do 50+ populations want from public libraries? Action, challenge, and engagement.
Implementation
Major changes are taking place in American education today, with a new emphasis on
learning across the life course. In this dynamic environment, libraries are well positioned
to become centers for older adult learning. Libraries and learning are synonymous in the
public’s mind. Most libraries include learning as part of their mission statements, their
collections, and services which exist to support learning, and most currently offer some
form of adult programs along with ‘enrichment opportunities’ for seniors. (Schull, 2012,
p. 219)
Most libraries are equipped with space, programming, and tools that offer opportunities
for exploring lifelong learning activities. “The maker movement arose to combine digital tools
and open-source sharing to create physical and digital objects” (Burke, 2014, p. 16).

40

Makerspaces exist as communities that exemplify the qualities of coworking, collaboration,
teaching and learning, and open sharing of ideas.
How can libraries make opportunities with intent and organized to dovetail with their
mission, including collections, services, programming, and professional development? Travis
Good (2013) outlined three approaches:
•

Collaborate: The library works with groups in the community to bring lifelong
learning activities into the library. Partnering with local organizations and individuals
can reduce the support role required of library staff members (Newcombe & Belbin,
2012). The library must be willing; however, to relinquish some control over the
results (Kenney, 2013). As Volhoj and Dybdal (2014) observed: “You create
together with your community not for it. Get the citizens involved from the
beginning, ownership is a process; don’t reduce your community to just guests” (p.
3). Collaborative work is “hard work and frequently messy” (Curwood, Munger,
Mitchell, MacKeigan, & Farrar, 2011, p. 16). It will be necessary to focus on
communication among diverse partners and other aspects of ongoing collaborations.
Questions about context, intragroup factors, and intergroup factors should be
addressed in the early stages of planning and speak to how power, responsibility, and
authority will be shared and “What will collaboration look like for our group”
(Curwood et al., 2011, pp. 19-22)? The library must be willing to change and expand
its parameters so ideas are not limited.

•

Centralize, Develop, and Deploy: Establish a lifelong learning center within the main
library to try out projects/workshops before launching the activities in satellite
locations. Units that support effective partnerships by pursuing a focused, outward-

41

looking mission provide direct service and education opportunities to community
partners, and research resulting in practical applications (Friedman, 2009, pp. 93-94;
Maddux, Bradley, Fuller, Darnell, and Wright, 2007). Community engagement will
be focused on capacity building for community partners, leading to long-term
relationships with communities, and resulting collaborative networks within and
across the community and public library. These relationships will exist at multiple
levels within the library to realize their potential for transforming the institution's
operation (Barnes et al., 2009).
•

Opportunistic/Entrepreneurial: The library commits to evolving into a lifelong
learning center for seniors and finds ways to repurpose existing resources and funding
to fulfill the commitment. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of community-initiated
engagement at each stage of the process (Cook, 2008), governmental and stakeholder
attitudes and funding patterns continue to promote public library-led partnerships.
Ross et al. (2010) offer a useful roadmap offering questions for consideration by each
party at each stage, from the establishment of partnerships through finding funding
and sustaining the partnership. The sustainability of the proposed lifelong learning
center relies in large measure on the establishment of reciprocal partnerships
characterized by shared resources and mutual trust (Garber, Epps, Bishop, and
Chapman, 2010; Larson & McQuiston, 2012; Zandee, 2012).

Burke (2014) also suggests that a choice must be made as to whether the center will
provide dedicated space for experiential lifelong learning, or instead rely on programming
related to lifelong learning, or a combination of both. This is a question that can change over the
lifetime of the library. The approach selected will certainly affect planning for the library.

42

Guiding Purpose
As digital content proliferates, the purpose of libraries is often called into question.
Almost any librarian could easily defend libraries’ value in innumerable ways, but after
one has finished with the defense, another important question remains: What are the key
roles and tasks we should be doing to sustain our libraries? (Bagley, 2014, p. viii)
In an informal 2013 survey of 109 librarians, Burke (2014, p. 18) recorded these
responses:
“We think [it] will fit into our core mission to support the research, teaching, and
coursework of our students, faculty, and staff. We are enabling patrons to extend the
application of their knowledge in order to manifest their ideas, learning, and research.”
“So there is a free community spot to create and get to know other community members.
To share expertise and learn from one another.”
“Not only do we continue to do the important work of preservation and access as we have
done all along, but increasingly there is an expectation that libraries will support content
creation. Without giving patrons access to the newly-available tools of content creation
so they can experiment with them, how can we know what’s possible and what directions
they’ll want to go in?”
Delaware State Librarian, Anne Norman states:
Known as ‘the people’s university,’ public libraries, like schools, are in the learning
business. However, public libraries have several strategic advantages over formal
education. Public libraries have more flexibility and can more easily adapt to trends and
to diversity in individual learner interests and talents. Public libraries support
comprehensively all subject domains and information content as they evolve. Public
libraries support all of the realms of lifelong learning: formal education, workforce
development, quality of life issues, and informal learning. (2011, p. 9)

43

Libraries exist to bring opportunities to members of their communities to come together, to
promote learning, and to support one another’s creations.
The American Library Association launched the Libraries Transform initiative in April
2016. Libraries Transform seeks to strengthen librarians’ roles as core community leaders and
change-agents. The initiative addresses a critical need within the library field by developing and
distributing new tools, resources, and support for librarians to engage with their communities in
new ways. The library traditionally supports educational efforts in STEM and other educational
areas by being a hub for educational activities. Re-shaping the library into a lifelong learning
center for seniors takes libraries a step beyond makerspaces. It is the intuitive transformation of
an institution that historically promotes and supports – even champions -- the arts and
humanities.
According to Delaware Division of Libraries Director, Anne Norman, author Daniel Pink
in his address to librarians at the Delaware Library Town Meeting in December 2005, challenged
libraries to create programs that enable Delawareans to be competitive in the “Conceptual Age,”
and to assist individuals to develop their innate talents (2011, p. 10).
The library of the last century is the library of consumption, an institution that reflects the
broadcast eras of media, the place where you watch, read, and listen passively from an
armchair. The library of this century is the place where new social relationships are
forged and knowledge is created, explored, and shared. (Goldenson & Hill, 2013, para.
3)
“We like to say in the future, we will be less about what we have for people and more about what
we do for and with people,” says Sari Feldman, president-elect of the American Library
Association (De Crescenzo & Walker, 2015, “Poke a Finger,” para. 3).

44

Participatory Culture
Henry Jenkins imagined a “participatory culture” in which people were not only the
passive consumers of media but also the creators of media (Jenkins et al., 2009). YouTube is an
excellent model of participatory culture. “People watch commercially produced music videos,
instructional videos, and episodes of television dramas, but they can also create their own videos
and upload them” (Burke, 2014, p. 13). This idea of being a participant and creator extends
beyond virtual media. To thrive, a public library must nurture and encourage an environment of
participation. Opportunities must be created for engagement at different levels; no one starts out
as an expert. A participatory culture may best be defined by faming this in terms of the
expectations of people who experience the center for the first time. Burke (2014) stated,
They want to be inspired by the culture of making that pervades the space. They want to
be able to use equipment or other tools that they cannot afford themselves. They want to
learn new techniques to do what they love from those in the [Center]. They want to
perhaps have their creations shaped by someone working in a completely different
medium – perhaps a medium they might turn to themselves. This all requires a positive
community environment of participation. (p. 12)
Just as the collaborative environment of a makerspace allows an individual to embrace
and even seek out challenges beyond his or her comfort zone, together participants in a library’s
lifelong learning center can collectively engage in shared, collaborative learning experiences.
Students today are already aware that learning extends beyond the four walls of a school and
they are part of a global educational community. But a key distinction between this and
makerspace or earlier construction-centered affinity groups, such as a local woodwork or sewing
club, is that the process of encouraging creativity and innovation does not have to result in a
physical product; many of the experiences produced by a cultural center are intrinsic

45

experiences, such as concerts, plays, readings, or other culminating experiences involving
performance arts (Fleming, 2015, p. 10). As Warren Bennis once stated: “There are two ways of
being creative: One can sing and dance, or one can create an environment in which singers and
dancers flourish” (Fleming, 2015, p. 12).
Interconnection via the Internet offers new and innovative avenues of collaboration and
training through open-source sharing.
Designs for products can be shared online or modified in collaboration with makers
across the globe. How-to videos can be created and accessed by a much wider audience.
Podcasts and video conferencing tools bring makers together in ways never possible
before. (Burke, 2014, p. 12)
But whether the connection takes place virtually or in person, it is the community, the network
where participants create and share ideas, which the library as a lifelong learning center will
evolve to host and nurture.
Sustainability
To address implementation, stakeholders and their concerns must be identified. Plans for
on-boarding will need to be crafted. Thought must be given to sustainability: funding and
governance, marketing, and recruiting talent. Attention must be given to the point of view of
those who would not support the transformation of the public library into a center for lifelong
learning for seniors, as well. Establishing public libraries as lifelong centers for learning for
seniors is not intended to threaten or replace existing venues or organizations but to strengthen,
support, and partner with them in order to cultivate and grow a vibrant and valued learning
community.
Public libraries serving as senior lifelong learning centers are intended to attract the
public to unique educational and enrichment opportunities. A well-informed stakeholder will
46

educate others and develop a culture, build support, create a positive mindset, and share
information with others. Word of mouth is the best advertisement, so long as the correct
information is shared. To build a positive culture, marketing should seek to know the
community’s lifelong learning needs, expectations, values, and provide a safe environment in
which to experience these components.
Evaluation should be built into each aspect of community interaction, reflecting the
public library’s commitment to assess the impact of the institution on the community. As the
public library moves engagement from outcome to process, many important objectives can be
accomplished, including strengthening communities, improving learning opportunities/outcomes
for consumers, and generating new knowledge through engaged library staff (Moore, 2014b).
Although the literature review is not comprehensive, and relative information is added
continuously, as long as the researcher maintains focus on the research question driving this
study, the result will be a document that can be used to initiate steps to turn this vision into a
reality.

Chapter III
Policy, Recommendations, and Implications
Introduction
It is unknown how public libraries are meeting the lifelong learning goals of the senior
demographic. This is, in part, because public libraries are not, in fact, meeting the lifelong
learning goals of the senior demographic. A review of library literature reveals a gap in service
to seniors. Using Delaware public libraries as an example that is representative of a larger,
nationwide gap in public library services to seniors, it is clear that practices must change to better
serve this demographics lifelong learning needs. It is recommended that public libraries expand
their traditional role in the community to incorporate the ability to positively impact lifelong
learning for seniors, and to support equitable access for all their users. As Larry Page, CEO of
Google once observed, “The main thing that has caused companies to fail, in my view, is that
they missed the future” (Yarow, 2014, para. 4).
Review of Delaware Libraries’ Programs for Seniors
All of Delaware’s public libraries belong to and participate in a statewide consortium.
This consortium shares resources, such as a universal online catalog, uniform circulation
software and hardware (SIRSI), shared access to the Internet, and so on. One of these shared
resources is an online calendar of events utilizing Evanced software (Delaware Division of
Libraries, 2017b). Here the libraries post program information, including the intended audience
of the program, and the focus of the program, using the Dewey Decimal Classification System to
clarify that focus. A review of retrospective programming for fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017
underscores that senior citizens are not being served.

48

The chart “Delaware Libraries Offering Programs to Seniors,” reflects how Delaware’s
public libraries serve the senior population through dedicated programming. It is a review of
self-reported library programming conducted for seniors encompassing fiscal years 2015 through
2017 via the online Evanced Calendar of Events (Delaware Division of Libraries, 2017b), which
is provided through the Delaware Division of Libraries.

Figure 2. Delaware public libraries offering of programs for seniors for Fiscal years 2015 to
2017.

Of Delaware’s thirty-five public libraries statewide, only nine libraries offered senior
programs in FY2015, twelve in FY2016, and 20 in FY2017. In Kent County, no senior-focused
programs were offered in FY2015, and only one public library offered senior programs in FY
2016 and only two libraries offered senior programs in FY 2017. This reveals a woeful lack of
attention to a group that makes up a third of Kent County’s population.

49

In “Delaware Public Libraries’ Senior Programs FY 2015 – FY2017,” applying the key
terms “senior” combined with “all programs” and “all libraries,” to the Delaware Division of
Libraries’ online Calendar of Events at http://de.evanced.info/delaware/lib/eventcalendar.asp
(Delaware Division of Libraries, 2017b), it was possible to review the number of programs
offered for “seniors and all ages,” “seniors/teens/adults,” “adults and seniors,” and “seniors.”

Figure 3. Delaware public libraries’ senior programs for FY 2015 to FY 2017.
The results may be skewed because there is no category for “Older Adults,” “Adult,” or
“Senior.” Some libraries, in order to avoid offending age-conscious individuals may have opted
to report the targeted age range for programs merely as “Adult,” rather than “Adult and Senior;”
programs identified as intended for “Adult” audiences only were not included in the results for
this survey. Over the course of three fiscal years, though, Kent County libraries offered only 59
senior programs (2.4 percent of senior programming offered statewide), and these were
comprised of introductory computer classes, tax preparation assistance, and coloring clubs.

50

Delaware Public libraries self-identify the Dewey decimal classification area that the
program serves, thus clarifying the topics offered via programs. The chart, “Senior Programs by
Dewey,” reports the variety of programs intended for seniors via Delaware’s public libraries.

Figure 4. Delaware public libraries FY 2015 senior programs by Dewey.

It should be noted that repeated weekly programs, such as tax assistance or one-on-one
technical assistance, or clubs that meet each week, such as knitting or crocheting groups, fitness
classes for tai chi or balance, groups that provide repeated outreach (for example, health
organizations that provide guidance regarding the Assisted Care Act), weekly coloring clubs,
and/or monthly book or film discussions limit the variety of programming offered to seniors
throughout Delaware, if not the total number of programs.
Still, with the exception of Kent County, public libraries in New Castle and Sussex
Counties offered nearly the same number of programs in FY 2015 (New Castle 221, Sussex 243)
and FY 2016 (New Castle 441, Sussex 454), increasing the volume of programs each year until
51

in FY 2017 Sussex County libraries pulled ahead (New Castle 454, Sussex 648). Kent County
public libraries offered no senior programming in FY 2015, nine programs by one library in FY
2016, and fifty programs between two libraries in FY 2017. It is clear that Kent County seniors
are underserved and there is much room for improvement statewide.
Literature Review Reveals a Gap
Even a cursory glance through the library profession’s literature reveals that
contemporary libraries are struggling to retain their cardholders and to generate and increase
participation. Their volunteer base and grassroots advocacy groups are experiencing a dwindling
membership. Libraries are in danger of being perceived as irrelevant. These circumstances have
forced libraries to explore and expand their role and vision.
Libraries have always been viewed as community cultural centers, but the movement to
expand the library’s vision to serve seniors is in its infancy. There is little agreement on a
vocabulary related to library services for the 50+ population. Informal lifelong learning, like the
50+ population, is a broad topic which easily encourages tangential research. When research is
narrowed to exploring how public library services provide the 50+ population with services,
collections, and programs related to lifelong learning, the available academic research becomes
surprisingly sparse. There is also a gap in professional library training regarding how to serve
seniors.
There are some forecasters in the library profession who are attempting to draw attention
to the disparity in library services for seniors. These include the Director of the Delaware
Division of Libraries, Anne Norman, New Jersey State Librarian, Mary Chute, Pennsylvania
State University’s Diantha Dow Schull, and George Washington University’s Gene D. Cohen.

52

Their insight into access to seniors’ lifelong learning opportunities, especially via libraries,
currently and in the future, proved particularly helpful and enlightening.
Transformation
“[Libraries] are already filled with creativity. The challenge is effectively cultivating and
harnessing it to its fullest. Evidence suggests we should challenge our beliefs about creative,
innovative thinking, and the environments in which that thinking is fostered (Root-Bernstein &
Root-Bernstein, 1999, pp. 12-13). Even though community well-being seems bleak (eroding
base of library support, shifting stakeholder funding priorities, changes in the philosophies of
governmental agencies), libraries should offer new opportunities [such as a lifelong learning
center for seniors] in an effort to grow new opportunities to support a community’s prosperity
(Dubb & Howard, 2007; Hodges & Dubb, 2012). Waiting until the right resources, schedule,
and budget are in place or for a space that embraces activities, or until the library staff feels like
an expert in makerspaces, defeats the creation and cultivation of a culture of innovation for all
users. “The truth is that the state of our public libraries is a kind of litmus test of not only our
economic health, but that of our democracy, too. After all, libraries are the free, democratization
of education, unbiased research, and uncensored enlightenment” (Bristol, 2012, para. 4).
Do we see libraries as a static organism or a constantly changing idea?
Change depends on a host of factors: Library leaders’ awareness of new needs, economic
climate, governance structure, institutional traditions, social and geographic environment,
and opportunities for professional development. Change can also be impeded by
...barriers...including, but not limited to ageism, institutional traditions, lack of leadership,
minimal resources, and lack of professional development or incentives for change.
(Schull, 2013, p. 22)

53

In the words of elementary principal and digital leader Brad Gustafson (2014), “...it is
your task to set up the conditions for a new learning paradigm built upon innovation, creation,
and design-iterations/failure to facilitate authentic learning” (p. 17). “Librarianship is not
centered around a particular set of tasks, but a particular way of thinking and this approach can
lead us into the future without fear” (Evangeliste & Furlong, 2014, p. 134). Fundamentally, a
library should inspire.
“To take full advantage of the library as a center for creative expression and to support
positive aging in their communities effectively, librarians must shift their perspective about older
adults. They must see them as creators, as well as consumers” (Schull, 2013, p. 184). Libraries
encourage informal learning and support the internalization of processes in users’ search for
information. Libraries are moving from consumption to creation and turning knowledge into
action, but as libraries transform into seniors’ lifelong learning centers, many of the “products,”
move from quantifiable output to qualitative, lifelong learning experiences.
Traditional models for senior services are no longer adequate for today’s diverse aging
populations. “Librarianship is not about artifacts, it is about knowledge and facilitating
knowledge creation. So what should we be spending our precious resources on? Knowledge
creation tools, not the results of knowledge creation” (Britton, 2012, p. 23). Current educational
practice reveals more emphasis on innovation, creative thinking, and entrepreneurship (Volhoj &
Dybdal, 2014).
Librarians must recognize that film screenings and trips to local museums are not, by
themselves, sufficient to promote positive aging. They must involve constituents in
selecting programs and designing participatory activities. They must abandon the notion
that they can ‘provide’ all the programs and instead form partnerships with ….educators
and cultural institutions. Finally, they must retool spaces and collections to support
[informal learning]. (Schull, 2013, p. 184)
54

A library is, at one level, a relatively formalized collection of information but it has
evolved to serve as a place to encourage open-ended exploration for all users. Libraries
emphasize the importance of access and collaboration within and beyond the physical
building, and are a place to encourage users to move beyond formal learning and
curricular structures. (Fleming, 2015, p. 26)
“It is the public library’s responsibility to promote effective and purposeful learning in
our libraries, not to preserve in aspic some golden-age notion of the library as a repository of
books and little else” (Fleming, 2015, p. 42). Librarians must seek input about library services
and programs not only from the arts community, but from midlife adults, including nonusers, and
integrate programs and services across the library that promote social, intellectual, and cultural
exchange. As Robert Butler, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Longevity Revolution
(2008) noted, “Adults can and should be active learners and creators into their older years”
(Schull, 2013, p. 63).
Public libraries need to leverage their role as learning places to support innovation and
creativity, using library spaces in ways that constituents both want and need. Utilizing libraries
as senior centers for lifelong learning provides public libraries with an opportunity to re-imagine
how they engage with community members. “As adults 55 and over work to make sense of their
options, opportunities and future directions, libraries will necessarily play key roles for
continuing learners” (Drago-Severson & Blum, 2010).
Public libraries are about to reinvent their role again, with an exciting paradigm shift in
modality. And, while each library must tailor its changes to reflect the needs of its
idiosyncratic community profile, staff, and strengths, the foundation is firm. The goal
will be to encourage thinking and to provide opportunities for experiential knowledge, to
enable problem-solving, and to inspire hands-on creativity. (Preddy, 2013, p. i)
A senior’s lifelong learning center extends the library’s…
55

…Capacity of sharing space and knowledge by increasing the types of work than can
happen in a library. Now library patrons can see physical items appear from their labors
rather than just words on a page. They can work with tools that take them from reading
about robots to seeing them scoot across the floor. Patrons can hold the skull of a snake
in their hands fresh from the 3D printer. They can also move from primarily consuming
information in the library to making physical and virtual things there. (Burke, 2014, p. 7)
As new technologies and trends emerge, librarians will need to assess and refine 50+ services on
a continuing basis.
Libraries that demonstrate a willingness to help move the profession in a new direction,
have the potential to emerge as the heart of the community, a venue and a patron of informal
learning and lifelong learning via collections, services, programs, performances, exhibits,
festivals, workshops, collaborative projects, and more. The library as a lifelong learning center
for seniors represents an exciting opportunity for libraries to extend their mission of sharing
resources with the widest possible audience and encourage learning, fostering exploration with
special attention to STEM education, facilitating informal learning opportunities, peer-to-peer
training, and nurturing lifelong learning. Collaboration with community partners will provide
expertise, help market programs, and share resources for mutual benefit.
“Education is the universal door that connects learning to all disciplines and cultivates
growth in the human experience” (Roach, 2012, p. 1). Lifelong learning is a continuum filled
with exploration, personal expression, risk-taking, and unlimited challenges. Transforming
public libraries into centers for seniors’ lifelong learning is an innovative solution for reform in
how public libraries approach services for seniors. Senior learners will discover the joy of
learning in the arts and humanities. Participants involved in the public library will enjoy become
lifelong learners, enjoy meaningful projects, and enjoy creating with confidence. Stakeholders,

56

leadership, and the greater library community will recognize the need for public libraries and
endorse the opportunity for all ages, including seniors, to explore lifelong learning in a safe
environment. Public Libraries will enhance senior learning and give them more choices in their
free-choice learning experiences, and incubate innovative methods and practices that raise the
bar for all participants.
“As stewards of lifelong learning, public libraries are ideally positioned to become
cornerstone institutions for productive aging. However, research has shown that library services
for “seniors” do not match the characteristics or interests of midlife adults, ages 50+. These
adults, many of whom are Baby Boomers, are experiencing a new, extended stage of midlife due
to significant increases in longevity. This lengthening of the human life span will have profound
effects...for generations to come, and the implications for libraries and other cultural institutions
will be equally profound” (California State Library, 2017, p. 1).
What can we envision for the next six to ten years of 50+ services? Will we see an
increased professional recognition of specialization in services to this demographic? Will library
schools offer specialist training, certification, and encourage academic research in this area?
Will public libraries embrace new roles, such as that of a cultural center, in the provision of
community library services? The answers to these questions are not yet clear. The information
presented in this paper strengthens arguments for staff training, for changes in how adult/senior
services are organized, for establishing a common vocabulary to address this growing
demographic group, and to establish the infrastructure and incentives to facilitate change. The
Idaho Commission for Libraries (2017) recognizes that by “providing information, training,
technical assistance, and resources....for all areas relating to mid-life adults” they are positioning
libraries to better serve as “catalysts, resources, meeting places, and partners in creating

57

opportunities for midlife adults to learn, teach, build skills, re-career, and become civically
engaged” (“Mid-Life Adults,” para. 3).
The potential of the public library as a center for 50+ lifelong learning is unrealized. The
Great Recession of 2008-2010 brought new urgency to discussions of the public library’s future.
“[T]he path to [U.S.] economic vitality...is ahead of us” (USC Rossier School of Education,
2017, “About”). Public libraries are a bridge to getting there. Hodges and Dubb (2012) use the
term anchor institution to denote an institution’s responsibility as an anchor in the local or
regional economy. These institutions have made a commitment to community well-being,
support service-learning projects, volunteerism, and community partnerships to address
community needs. Visualizing the library as an active partner in creating lifelong learning
experiences for seniors will have a profound impact on librarianship, an impact that will grow
over time, even though the concept has been around for quite some time, yet few librarians are
focusing specifically on 50+ adult learning. The public library offers a robust, unique learning
environment within its unique community. In the context of an aging society, the public library
has an opportunity to fulfill their missions to advance community learning more effectively if
they are intentional in meeting the needs of seniors. With a special focus on innovating and
creating as a way to keep libraries relevant and vibrant in these changing times, the
transformation of the public library into a lifelong learning center for seniors that will serve to
inspire other libraries to foster a culture of creating as opposed to consuming throughout the state
of Delaware.
Conclusion
Driven by the largest demographic and social transformation in United States history, the
aging of America, serving senior citizens will play an increasingly dominant role in library

58

services. Public libraries with an established history as purveyors of the arts and humanities are
at a crossroads; as libraries are in the lifelong learning business and many are seeking to expand
their role within the community, it is an opportune time for public libraries to reinvent
themselves. Libraries are a logical venue for the role seniors’ lifelong learning centers due to
their established history, community partnerships, established infrastructure, and relationship to
citizens in their service areas.
Public libraries have always been viewed as community cultural centers, but the
movement to expand the library’s vision to actively educate, provide makerspace, and to become
an informal learning hub, actively seeking to embrace and explore the arts and humanities within
the library’s physical space has only begun to emerge. Research into this trend is hampered by
vague vocabulary, and because the library profession failed to be proactive in addressing what
the impact the aging “boomer” population, with its increased life expectancy and improved
general health, would have on the scope, organization, and content of services and programs
public libraries offer for midlife and other active older adults. Available academic material
exploring how public library services provide 50+ populations with services, collections, and
programs is sparse. Only four ALA-accredited library schools (out of fifty, nationwide) offer
any coursework related to serving this demographic.
Delaware libraries are clearly remiss in addressing services for age 50+ adults. A review
of the programs offered by Delaware libraries to senior citizens clearly proves that public
libraries fail to serve this demographic. This gap may be the best opportunity to position public
library services as agencies of positive aging and stewards of lifelong learning. If libraries rally,
reinventing themselves as centers for lifelong learning, particularly for seniors, the fastest

59

growing demographic, then, rather than being declared obsolete, public libraries may become the
keystone institution for learning, creativity, encore careers, and community engagement.
Research indicates a library that promotes active social contact, encourages creativity,
and uses mentoring, is likely to positively affect health and wellbeing. Participants would
benefit from group activity and the sense of belonging to a group, as well as the benefits of
producing art and through “consumption” of art through book clubs, performances, and other
opportunities for social contact. Re-envisioning the public library as an integral supporter of
lifelong learning for the whole individual while improving quality of life senior citizens may
keep public libraries relevant and vibrant in these changing times. Since there is not a true
uniform definition of what a lifelong learning center for seniors can be, it is important to
establish open dialogue with potential users and stakeholders.
The first step in achieving equity in Delaware’s senior services via public libraries is to
generate a plan for the implementation of a lifelong learning as it impacts senior citizens.
Stakeholders and users must re-envision the public library as a lifelong learning center that
provides support of informal learning for the whole individual while improving quality of life for
its senior citizenry. Libraries are already perceived as cultural venues as the result of the
makerspace movement and their long association with the arts and humanities; many libraries
already have the infrastructure in place or in progress to expand this role.
In addition to establishing benchmarks for exemplary programs, services, and collections,
constituents should be encouraged to voice their vision of a successful lifelong learning center
for seniors. Constituents should take an active role in seeking out centers and visiting these
venues on site to further develop reference for all the possibilities that a center for lifelong
learning via a public library can be.

60

Informed by the feedback provided by constituents and stakeholders, the library staff
must focus on practices that will lead to connected experiences that help maximize the value of
innovating and also create toolsets to enhance learning experiences that empower and equip
users with necessary skills to effectively produce and consume content across a variety of media
platforms. Staff must be driven to enable customers by applying innovative methods and cutting
edge technology in a variety of lifelong learning areas.
Unfortunately, just as there is a gap in vocabulary to describe the 50+ population, there is
a gap in formal training in library services for seniors. Training library specialists to address the
programming, collection, and service needs of seniors is not widespread. It is logical that
librarians need to establish curriculum, training, and academic departments to prepare staff to
serve people wherever they are on their lifelong learning journey. ALA-accredited library
schools need to develop library education curriculum or certification programs focusing on
services to seniors. State libraries and other agencies that train librarians already serving in the
field must offer more professional development opportunities, including webinars. The
profession should establish a specialization status for librarians trained to serve seniors.
Libraries will retain their role as a place to read, to research, and to access information.
But to stay relevant, libraries must evolve into a place where knowledge is created and not
merely warehoused. With insight and commitment, transforming public libraries into seniors’
centers for lifelong learning will provide instructive models of change to other libraries
statewide, and even nationally. Public libraries are positioned to become stewards of lifelong
learning, the keystone institution for senior citizens. As a result of these developments, a new
movement will emerge, a movement that portends restructuring of library services and promises
new relationships and profound impact between libraries and the constituents they serve.

61

The research supports the conclusion that public libraries, especially those that embrace
the current makerspace movement, are evolving into informal learning centers across the nation.
Central Delaware is grossly underserved in all areas that a center for lifelong learning for seniors
would embrace.
Recommendations
Re-envisioning the public library as a center of lifelong learning for the whole individual
while improving quality of life for its senior citizenry is the key to ensuring public libraries
remain relevant and vibrant in these changing times. Since there is not a true uniform definition
of what a lifelong learning center for seniors can be, it is important to establish open dialogue
with potential users and stakeholders.
The first step in achieving equity senior services via public libraries is to generate a plan

of lifelong learning, the keystone institution for senior citizens. As a result of these
developments, a new movement will emerge, a movement that portends restructuring of library
services and promises new relationships and profound impact between libraries and the
constituents they serve. Abraham Lincoln and Peter Drucker have been attributed as saying,
“The best way to predict the future is to create it.” Libraries should take note and seize the

63

opportunity to craft a better approaches to serving the burgeoning baby boomer population now
and in the future. Instead of planning for libraries’ futures, we should create it.
