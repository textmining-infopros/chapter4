I dedicate my dissertation work to my family and friends. I especially thank my husband,
Kenneth Smith, and my parents, O. Clifford and Charlene Boyer for their steadfast love
and support, as well as my son Augustin, for his understanding and patience while
Mommy worked on her “big homework.” I thank my brother, Thomas Dobson, and my
sister, Julia Dobson, for their faith in me. I will always appreciate the encouragement of
my friends, especially that of my Library faculty colleagues, Damaris Schmitt, Rebecca
Helbling, and Janice Hovis, who provided ongoing inspiration and assistance, as well as
reality checks. I also thank Karla Seddon, Writing Specialist who provided patient
proofreading, and Dr. Gail Heyne Hafer, Business and Economics professor, who
reviewed the quantitative data. I am also grateful to the Reverend Father Abraham
Arganiosa for his spiritual support. Finally, I want to thank God and the intercession of
our Mother Mary and of the Saints. Thank you all—without your support and your belief
in me, this dissertation would never have been accomplished.

ABSTRACT
The nursing profession is evolving from basing patient care on tradition and
expert opinion to emphasizing evidence based practice. Literature suggests that nurses
do not have the information literacy skills required for evidence based practice, and that
they have neither adequate instruction nor the experience needed to effectively,
efficiently, and ethically find the information that they need. To help meet this need, this
dissertation examines the effects of a pre-requisite information literacy credit course on
the information seeking behavior of community college students in an introductory
nursing course. I used a convergent parallel designed mixed-methods research approach,
employing both a knowledge based assessment (n = 153) and a series of interviews/focus
groups (n= 16) to test the hypothesis and sub-hypotheses. Students’ exposure to the
library (using library databases, receiving assistance from a reference librarian, or
attending a “one-shot” library instruction session) was also measured. Using the Chisquare test for association, a statistically significant relationship was found between the
correct answers on the knowledge based assessment and the completion of the course: X2
(3, N = 153) = 19.03, p < .00; suggesting that students who completed LIB 101
performed significantly better on the knowledge based assessment than the students who
did not complete LIB 101. A low, significant, and positive relationship was found
between the completion of the course and the information literacy score, rpb = .26, p < .01
using Point-Biserial correlation. Regression Analysis provided evidence that the library
course was a significant predictor of the information literacy score, t(150) = 2.12, p < .05.
Eleven themes supporting the quantitative study emerged from the interviews/focus

ix
groups. Although the research supported the main hypothesis, there is much room for
further study—not only within the confines of the effect of such a course on nursing
students, but also the effect of information literacy instruction on both student and
practicing nurses. The future of nursing relies upon evidence based practice, and,
ultimately, evidence based practice relies on information literate nurses.

1
THE EFFECTS OF PRE-REQUISITE LIBRARY RESEARCH INSTRUCTION ON
THE INFORMATION SEEKING KNOWLEDGE AND BEHAVIOR OF
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IN AN
INTRODUCTORY NURSING COURSE
Chapter One:
Introduction

The society of the twenty-first century is heavily dependent upon
information. Individuals are continuously confronted by technological advancement
which only serves to aid in the proliferation of information in their academic studies, in
their occupations/workplaces, and even in their day-to-day personal lives. The sheer
overabundance of information in and of itself does not allow for a more informed
society: information may be inaccurate, misleading, biased, obsolete, or otherwise
bad. Information literacy, the “ability to know when there is a need for information, to
be able to identify, locate, evaluate, and effectively use that information for the issue or
problem at hand” (National Forum on Information Literacy [NFIL], n.d), provides
learners with the knowledge and experience necessary for self-directed inquiry and for
learning from reliable content—regardless of the level, the subject matter, or the
environment of the information need. The NFIL further describes information literacy as
the “key competency” for personal, academic, and occupational effectiveness and success
(NFIL, n.d.). One such occupation which increasingly relies on the ever-growing body of
information is nursing. This dissertation will examine the effects of a pre-requisite

2
information literacy credit course on the information seeking behavior of community
college students in an introductory nursing course.
Definitions of Terms
Throughout this study, several terms are used which may have varied meanings. In some
cases, basic definitions are provided below while a more substantial exploration of the
topic will be included in this chapter or in Chapter 2: Literature Review.

Boolean Operators: The basic Boolean operators are AND, OR, and NOT. AND
connects terms and directs a keyword search to only produce items with both terms in the
item record or description. OR directs a keyword search to produce items with either
term or any of a group of terms. NOT directs a keyword search to produce records with
the first term, but only when they do not include the second term. For example: Dog
AND Cat will only find results with both terms in the descriptions. Dog OR Cat will find
results with either or both terms in the descriptions. Dog NOT Cat will only find results
that include the term Dog, but exclude those results that include both Dog and Cat.

Catalog: A library catalog is (usually) a searchable online inventory of a library’s
holdings based upon records—or descriptions—of each item.

Closed Access (Resources): Online resources which are restricted. Some, such as library
databases, provide users access onsite via recognized IP addresses and remotely by

3
username/password login. This is as opposed to Open Access (Resources).

Database: While a database is simply a searchable electronic collection of information,
for the purposes of the dissertation, database (or library database) denotes a Closed
Access online collection of information to which a library subscribes to provide access to
its users. Remote access is usually available, but requires users to input a password or
other permission code. Items in databases are retrieved via searches which may search
the records (descriptions) of items or the full-text of items (when available).

Evidence Based Practice (EBP): Refers to medical care based upon not only the
knowledge/experience of the practitioner and the needs of individual patient, but also the
best practices substantiated by current research. Evidence Based Practice will be further
discussed and explored within the dissertation.

Information Literacy: The ability to efficiently, effectively, and ethically find, access,
and use information. Information Literacy will be further discussed and explored within
the dissertation.

Keyword Search: A keyword search is the most flexible basic search function in a library
catalog or database. A keyword search can be manipulated to include Boolean operators
which can narrow and/or broaden search terms. This is opposed to other basic search

4
functions—Title, Author, and Subject—which require specific language and order of
terms.

LibGuide: A content management system produced by Springshare used by libraries to
easily create subject web pages, to administer surveys and assessments, and to teach oneshots and other instructional sessions. The assessment administered as part of the
dissertation research was created and hosted via the LibGuides survey/test instrument.

Nested Search: A sophisticated keyword search incorporating multiple Boolean operators
and distribution logic. For example, a basic Boolean search for a research project on
heroin use in teenagers might be: heroin AND teenagers. A nested search might be:
heroin AND (teenagers OR adolescents).

One-shot: A library instruction session taught by a librarian during a regularly held
session for a subject discipline course. One-shots maybe held during part of a class
session or may meet several times during the course of a semester. These are usually
focused on a library instruction topic rather than merely a tour or orientation to the library
facility.

Open Access (Resources): Online resources which are freely available, meaning that one
can click on a link or type in a URL and access the resource without any permission

5
(such as a password, recognized IP address, etc.). This is as opposed to Closed Access
(Resources).
Current State and Outlook in Nursing
Increase in nursing information. Before the popular adoption of the internet,
Verhey estimated that the amount of nursing information “doubles every 5 years” (1999,
252); and, within the last decade, Smith and Hazelton referred to the “rapid expansion in
the number of nursing journals published, both regionally and internationally”
(2008). While the number of nursing citations may not be doubling every five years,
there is evidence that there has been a continual and substantial increase. For example,
MEDLINE, a government bibliographic database from the U.S. National Library of
Medicine (NLM), included over 22 million life sciences and biomedicine journal
citations as of May 2015 (NLM, 2015a). The MEDLINE collection increased by an
average of 416,022 citations each government fiscal year between 1995 and 1999; an
average of 578,861 each year between 2000 and 2010, and an average of 729,803 each
year from 2010 through 2013 (NLM, 2014). While the MEDLINE collection has not
doubled every five years as suggested by Verhey’s 1999 estimation, it has steadily
approached doubling over a ten year span, having included 12,421,396 citations in 2004
(NLM, n.d.) and 22,376,811 (NLM, 2015b) citations a decade later.
Of course, MEDLINE includes only citations from scholarly literature. These
numbers do not reflect nursing related websites and social media, such as blogs. Blogs
are growing in number “exponentially” and in importance for health related information

6
for both patients and healthcare providers (Watson, 2012, 215). Watson suggested that
those in health related occupations should “harness the informational, educational,
networking, and supportive power of blogs” and “understand how to access and use blogs
for professional use” (Watson, 2012, 215). Health and nursing related blogs, like other
blogs, range in seriousness, credibility and usability; and, they can easily be found via
open web search engines. Popular nursing blogs that I found in the top results list from
various searches (such as “humorous nursing blogs,” “top nursing blogs,” and “best
nursing blogs,” among others) included:


Off the Charts, hosted by the American Journal of Nursing [AJN] (AJN, n.d.)
(referred to by Watson, 2012, 216)



Nursing Informatics hosted by the Healthcare Information and Management
Systems Society [HIMSS] (HIMSS, n.d.)



Innovative Nurse, a personal blog by Kevin Ross, BSN, RN, and co-host of the
RN.FM online radio show (Ross, n.d.)



The Nerdy Nurse, a personal blog by Brittney Wilson, BSN, RN (Wilson, n.d.),
who won the 2014 AJN Book Award for a book based on the blog, The Nerdy
Nurse's Guide to Technology (“Book of the Year,” 2015) (referred to by Watson,
2012, 216).



Nurse Eye Roll: Humor, Honesty, Nursey Shenanigans, a personal blog by Kati
Kleber, BSN, RN. Kleber has written two books, one for nurses—Becoming
Nursey: From Code Blues to Code Browns, How to Care for Your Patients and
Yourself published in 2014—and one for family/caregivers, Admit One: What You

7
Must Know When Going to the Hospital, But No One Actually Tells You published
in 2016 (Kleber, n.d.; “A Bold Voice,” 2015).


NurseBuff: Nursing Humor and Lifestyle Blog, a personal blog by an unidentified
“registered nurse” with which “stressed out nurses can relax, connect with other
nurses from around the world, and simply have a great time” (NurseBuff, n.d.).

If the number of blog posts and other social media content related to the nursing
profession is considered, Verhey’s estimation of nursing information doubling every 5
years may be too conservative.
Increase in number of nurses and in number of nurses needed. Explosions in
growth related to the nursing profession are not limited to the literature. Nursing, as a
career, is growing; but, there remains a national shortage (American Nurses Association
[ANA], 2013). Although the number of nurses nationwide continues to grow, those
numbers cannot meet the steadily increasing demand. The number of registered nurses
(RNs) employed in the United States rose from just over 2.5 million in 2010 (U.S.
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] 2012) to over 2.7 million in 2014;
the BLS predicted that the total number of RNs would increase 19% from 2012 to 2022
(2014). Despite the predicted increase, nursing organizations, such as the ANA, believe
that there will still be a shortage of qualified nurses because: (1) 50% of the “nursing
workforce” will soon be eligible for retirement, (2) aging demographics [with an assumed
greater need for nursing care], and (3) health care reforms, such as the 2010 Affordable
Care Act (to be discussed later), have the potential to impact healthcare (ANA, 2013).

8
On September 4, 2014, the ANA celebrated the 50 anniversary of the Nurse
th

Training Act by publishing recommendations to the federal government regarding
“federal funding, nursing education, and hiring practices” to encourage more people to
enter the nursing profession. Specifically, the ANA called for “increased investment in
nursing education and preparation” to not only meet the “dire need for one million new
nurses by 2020” but to also prepare well-trained nurses (ANA, 2014). In response, Rep.
Lois Capps (D-CA) introduced “Title VIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act of
2015” in June of 2015 to extend and to expand education nursing grants. The bill was
referred back to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce from the Health
subcommittee in September, 2016, where it currently awaits amendment by voice vote.
(H.R. 2713, 2015; H.R. 2713, 2016).
Ferguson’s Career Guidance Center (FCGC), an online career research database
providing job and industry profiles as well as other career-based information, concurs
with the ANA and the BLS, stating that while the “employment prospects for RNs are
excellent” (“Registered Nurses,” 2015), the shortage of nurses will continue as nurses
leave the profession due to “unsatisfactory working conditions”— such as mandatory
overtime and understaffing directly due to the shortage—or to retirement. The FCGC
predicts that the shortage will be exacerbated as improved technology increases available
treatment options and as nurse practitioners in care centers absorb functions and
responsibilities previously only held by medical doctors in private offices and hospitals
(“Registered Nurses,” 2015).

9
Affordable Care Act. A recent and continuing game-changer for the nursing
profession has been the Affordable Care Act. While contentious debate regarding the
legislation continues into 2016 political campaigns (Andrews & Kaplan, 2015), the
United States, after years of unsuccessful efforts at health care reform, enacted the first
comprehensive health care reform since the 1960’s passage of Medicare and
Medicaid. Originally introduced in September, 2009 by Representative Charles Rangel
of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee as H.R. 3590, what became
known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law on March 23, 2010 as the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, amended by the HealthCare and Education
Reconciliation Act days later on March 30 (Ballard, 2011; Lathop & Hodnicki, 2014;
“Patient Protection,” 2010, “Health Care and Reconciliation, 2010), and upheld by the
Supreme Court on June 28, 2012 (“National Federation,” 2012). Although the ACA did
not create a single-payer national health insurance or provide for health insurance as a
human right for all United States citizens, it did provide for the goals of increasing access
to health insurance, and concomitantly increasing access to preventive medicine:


Insurance companies cannot drop coverage when the insured become sick or
injured.



Pre-existing conditions will not preclude insurance coverage.



Expensive care will not put the insured at risk: lifetime caps are prohibited and
annual caps are limited.



The insured will have (increased) rights to appeal coverage rejection.



Adult children (up to age 26) are coverable by parental/guardian plans.

10


The insured will have (increased) access to preventable care services with no
copay.



The insured will have (increased) access to emergency services and certain
covered emergency services must be covered regardless if the service was
provided in or out of network.



The insured will have an increased pool of primary care providers from which to
choose, including nurse practitioners.

Ultimately, it provided for increased access to health insurance, preventive health
services, and primary care providers (Ballard, 2011; Lathop & Hodnicki, 2014; “Patient
Protection,” 2010, “Health Care and Reconciliation, 2010).
The provisions regarding preventative and primary care have greatly increased the
need for such care. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint
Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that due to the ACA, beginning by 2016,
between “20 million and 23 million people will receive coverage through the new
insurance exchanges” (CBO, 2012). Hofer, Abraham, and Moscovice estimated that
“between 15.07 million and 24.26 million” of those newly insured individuals will begin
to seek primary and preventive care by 2019, requiring an increase in primary care
providers (2011). A Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation survey suggested that of those
newly insured Americans, over a third would have not had a physical in the two years
prior to coverage. The survey also provided support that the newly insured will not only
have poorer health than those who have had ongoing health insurance, but that they will
also have had fewer conditions diagnosed, much less treated (2011). Thus, as the

11
marginalized who have been without insurance become insured, they are likely to need
more frequent and more specialized care—and, consequently, more access to providers.
Expanded role of nurses in American health care. The ACA alone has
certainly increased the need for medical services in the United States. Moreover, the
aging of the American population also has heightened the demand for medical care. In
2012, the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration estimated that there were
5,860 designated Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas where individuals do
not and cannot obtain primary care services due to provider shortages (Lathop &
Hodnicki, 2014). By 2014, the estimate was updated to “approximately 6,100”
(HRSA). To meet the growing demand, American health care across the nursing
spectrum must—and is—changing. The role and responsibilities of nurses, whether those
of an RN or those of a doctoral level nurse, have expanded. Lathop & Hodnicki
discussed nurses’ new roles as “full partners with physicians and other healthcare
professionals” in the delivery of primary care services; and, they advocated for a growing
role of “Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) who hold the Doctor of Nursing
Practice (DNP) degree” (2014). The National Governor’s Association similarly
recommended an increased use of nurse practitioners (2012).
Evidence based practice. The growth in the number of RNs, the shift from
doctor to nurse practitioner as primary care giver, and the increased patient care
responsibilities of nurses parallels the evolution of the practice of nursing from one
emphasizing tradition and expert opinion to one where “clinical decisions” are made
based upon “best research evidence coordinated with clinical expertise and patient values

12
and preferences” (“Evidence-Based Practice,” 2010). The evidence based practice (EBP)
outlines four stages:
1. Converting clinical problems into answerable questions involves formulating
either general (background) or care-specific (foreground) questions, such as the
following: Background question – What is the effect of tobacco smoking on the
circulatory system? Foreground question – Does clinician counseling result in a
higher rate of smoking cessation among smokers in primary care practice than
written materials?
2. Locating best evidence with maximum efficiency involves information
management skills including, especially, the use of electronic databases
3. Critically appraising evidence for its validity, importance, and usefulness
involves application of specific criteria to determine the methodological rigor,
significance, and generalizability of research findings.
4. Integrating this appraisal with clinical expertise and patient values involves
considering how research-based best evidence corresponds to clinicians' prior
experiences and unique knowledge of both the patient and the situation.
(“Evidence-Based Practice,” 2010).
Steps 2 and 3 parallel the concepts of information literacy, which will be discussed later
in the chapter.
The nursing profession and its stakeholders have stressed the growing importance
of evidence based practice due to “its potential to effectively handle clinical issues and
provide better patient care” (Majid et al., 2011, 229) and its resulting increases in quality

13
of care and decreases in cost. As nurses become more responsible for patient care, they
must rely more heavily on EBP and on medical literature. However, research into the
information behavior and use of working nurses, as well as nursing students, suggested
that a majority of nurses do not understand the concept of, much less use, EBP (Pagoto et
al., 2007; Pravikoff, Tanner, & Pierce, 2005). Other studies (discussed later), provided
evidence that nurses need stronger information literacy skills; the American Association
of Colleges of Nursing [AACN] refers to “information literacy” as essential (2008).
However, there is no set curriculum for information literacy in nursing programs. The
Institute of Medicine [IOM] recognized the need for training in evidence based practice
across healthcare professions [medical doctors, nurses, and pharmacists] (2009). The
dissertation research examines the results of such training via an information literacy
college credit course on student nurses.
Information Literacy
Defining and analyzing information literacy. Although what is commonly
referred to as ‘information literacy’ has been given various labels throughout its history,
librarians have been instructing students how to find and use information since the late
nineteenth century. Some of the labels have included: information literacy, information
competency, library instruction, the research process, and bibliographic instruction.
Paul Zurkowski (1974) seems to have been the first person to write about
information literacy, using the term “information literates” as “hav[ing] learned
techniques and skills for utilizing the wide range of information tools as well as primary

14
sources in molding information solutions to their problems” (6). Zurkowski estimated
that “perhaps one-sixth” of the people of the United States would qualify as having such
skills (1974, 7). The larger portion of the population, Zurkowski stated, “while literate in
the sense that they can read and write, do not have a measure for the value of
information, do not have an ability to mold information to their needs, and realistically
must be considered to be information illiterates (1974, 6). Since then, the definition of
information literacy has expanded and now includes critical thinking, the use of
technology, and the ethical and responsible use of information, (Guskin, 2007, xi;
Hardesty, Schmitt, & Tucker, 1986, 35). Although there are other existing definitions,
standards, and measurements of information literacy, such as the Big 6/Super 3
developed mainly for elementary and high school students (Eisenberg, Berkowitz,
Darrow, & Spitzer, 2000; Eisenberg, Berkowitz, Jansen, & Little, 1999; Needham, 2002;
Robinson, 2008) for example, this research will be based upon information literacy as
defined by two major divisions of the American Library Association (ALA): the
Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) and the American Association of
School Librarians (AASL). The ALA defines Information Literacy as the ability to
"recognize when information is needed and…to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the
needed information” (1989). The two divisions of ALA concerned with formal
educational environments, the ACRL [higher education] and the AASL [K-12], have
expanded upon the basic idea and have established specific standards and/or frameworks
that are appropriate for different levels of students. Although the research focused on
community college students, the AASL structure was considered pertinent to the research

15
because it provided conceptual ideas rather than formulaic criteria as were the ACRL
structures at the time of the research development.
Library association division structures of information literacy. These four
library profession based structures of Information Literacy: the AASL 21st Century
Learners and the ACRL Competency Standards, Nursing Standards, and Framework,
provided a solid foundation to the research by aiding in the clarification of what was to be
assessed, relative to freshmen level college/university students. Holding these standards
and competencies in mind was necessary to better comprehend the various ways in and
levels at which previous investigations had understood and explained information
literacy.
AASL. Although the AASL is focused on K-12 education, its more open
framework, as opposed to that developed by the ACRL (discussed later) in effect during
the development of the research protocol, was considered as it was less restrictive and
more open to interpretation and certainly did not apply only to school children. The
AASL, in partnership with the Association for Educational Communications and
Technology, had published the Information Literacy Standards for Student Learning
(1998) that identified nine standards by which K-12 teachers could identify and describe
the information literacy of their students:


Standard One: The student who is information literate accesses information
efficiently and effectively.



Standard Two: The student who is information literate evaluates information
critically and competently.

16


Standard Three: The student who is information literate uses information
accurately and creatively.



Standard Four: The student who is an independent learner is information literate
and pursues information related to personal interests.



Standard Five: The student who is an independent learner is information literate
and appreciates literature and other creative expressions of information.



Standard Six: The student who is an independent learner is information literate
and strives for excellence in information seeking and knowledge generation.



Standard Seven: The student who contributes positively to the learning
community and to society is information literate and recognizes the importance of
information to a democratic society.



Standard Eight: The student who contributes positively to the learning community
and to society is information literate and practices ethical behavior in regard to
information and information technology.



Standard Nine: The student who contributes positively to the learning community
and to society is information literate and participates effectively in groups to
pursue and generate information (AASL, 1998).

These were restructured and simplified in 2007 with the AASL publication, 21 Century
st

Learners. The 2007 publication outlined four main information literacy goals for K-12

17
(arguably any) students—that they should be able to use their own knowledge and skills
as well as tools and other resources to:


inquire, think critically, and gain knowledge;



draw conclusions, make informed decisions, apply knowledge to new situations,
and create new knowledge;



share knowledge and participate ethically and productively as members of our
democratic society;



pursue personal and aesthetic growth (2007, 3).

The AASL 21st Century Learners was considered during the development of the
dissertation research, based upon the idea that a 21st century nurse unquestionably must
be a 21st century learner and should be able to meet the AASL criteria and suggested
outcomes. The AASL further categorizes the outcomes by the “skills, dispositions in
action, responsibilities, and self-assessment strategies” for each standard (2007, 47). The 21st Century Learners stresses the importance of the “cognitive processes” and
the “significant role” of libraries in student learning (Farmer, 2013, 173). These—
especially the “dispositions”—circle back to the concepts within the ACRL Framework
to be discussed later.
ACRL.
Competency Standards. In the Information Literacy Competency Standards for
Higher Education (Standards) (2000), the ACRL defined five standards of information
literacy, outlining that the information literate student:


determines the nature and extent of the information needed;

18


accesses needed information effectively and efficiently;



evaluates information and its sources critically and incorporates selected
information into his or her knowledge base and value system;



uses information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose;



understands many of the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of
information and accesses and uses information ethically and legally (2000, 8-14).

Although the ACRL also provided performance indicators and outcomes for each of the
five standards, each standard was easily transferable to the concept of a nursing student
with a basic grounding in EBP who should be able to:


determine the nature and extent of the medical question—can the student nurse
express the information need and formulate a question?



construct keyword searches to address the main ideas—can the student nurse
utilize Boolean and other search strategies?



access relevant information from medical literature and/or other credible
sources—can the student nurse:


differentiate between popular and scholarly (medical) resources?



identify a peer reviewed article?



quickly find and access resource(s) appropriate and applicable to the
question?

19


evaluate information and its sources critically and incorporates selected
information into his or her knowledge base and value system—can the student
nurse:


apply critical thinking methods to the new information?



add the new information, whether accepted or rejected, to his/her
knowledge base regarding the question topic?



use information effectively in a response to the medical question—can the student
nurse employ the new knowledge to the information need?



understand many of the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of
information and accesses and uses information ethically and legally—does the
student nurse understand the difference between open web accessible information
and the information available through the college library?

Reflecting upon the ACRL Standards in light of the nursing faculty’s vision of a nursing
student with an information literacy level appropriate to novice EBP as illustrated above
helped with the development of the questions for both the quantitative and the qualitative
investigations.

Nursing Standards. The Information Literacy Competency Standards for Nursing
(Nursing Standards) were approved by the ACRL Board of Directors in
2013. Developed to fill the gap created by the related, but dissimilar addressing of health
and nursing information by the Medical Library Association and by the ACRL, the
Nursing Standards created competencies that could be shared between the two
associations. The Nursing Standards focused on nurses in academia—from the associate

20
through the doctoral level—as well as to practicing nurses and those completing
continuing education. The Nursing Standards defined the term nurses as “nursing
students, nursing faculty and practicing nurses” (ACRL, 2013).

The Information Literacy Standards for Nursing were designed to:


provide a framework for faculty and students of nursing at the associate,
baccalaureate, master’s, and doctoral levels in the development of information
literacy skills for evidence-based nursing practice;



encourage the use of a common language for nursing faculty and librarians to
discuss student information seeking skills;



guide librarians and nursing faculty in creating learning activities that will support
the growth of information literacy skills over the course of a program of nursing
education and for lifelong learning;



provide administration and curriculum committees a shared understanding of
student competencies and need; and



provide a framework for continuing education in the area of information literacy
for the field of nursing practice and research (ACRL, 2013).

Although the term framework is used in the introduction to the Nursing Standards,
the Nursing Standards are, indeed, standards and are closely related to the 2000 ACRL
Standards for Information Literacy and include specific nursing related outcomes/
performance indicators. However, as the Nursing Standards apply to nurses at all levels,
including nurses at post-doctoral levels, some of the standards were not applicable to the

21
students in the dissertation study: community college students newly admitted to an
associate level nursing program.

Framework. Both the Standards and the Nursing Standards include criteria based
upon ideas regarding information literacy from the turn of the century. In July 2011,
following the five-year cycle of review as per the association policy (2016), ACRL
created a task force to review the Standards and to determine if they should be retained,
revised, or withdrawn (2015). In response to the recommendation that they be revised
(ACRL 2015), the association tasked a second committee to develop the Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework). Issued separately from the
Standards, the Framework does not necessarily update them; but, instead, offers a new,
flexible way to think about information literacy without specified boundaries. The
Framework was developed around the idea that both higher education and information
are dynamic and is composed of six “frames”—each of which, in turn, is comprised of a
threshold concept, knowledge practices, and dispositions. The ACRL defined the three
terms:


threshold concepts: “ideas in any discipline that are passageways or portals to
enlarged understanding or ways of thinking and practicing within that discipline”



knowledge practices: “demonstrations of ways in which learners can increase
their understanding of these information literacy concepts”



dispositions: “ways in which to address the affective, attitudinal, or valuing
dimension of learning” (ACRL, 2015, 2)

22
Because no one threshold concept was considered more important than another, the
Framework presented them in alphabetical order:


Authority Is Constructed and Contextual



Information Creation as a Process



Information Has Value



Research as Inquiry



Scholarship as Conversation



Searching as Strategic Exploration.

The Framework was designed to be flexible so that libraries and librarians could
adapt it based upon their needs; however, current discussions of the threshold concepts,
knowledge practices, and dispositions suggest that librarians are struggling with
comprehension and application—instead of being flexible, the framework may be too
vague to be useful. For example, Amigos Library Services held a webinar April 17-18,
2016 entitled, Information Literacy: Adapting to the New Framework. One problem
discussed was that some librarians likened the knowledge practices to “what we [the
librarians] want them [the students] to know” and the dispositions to “what they [the
students] know or can demonstrate after instruction” (Hunt, 2016). Yet, others associated
dispositions to “what they [the students] do” which, in turn, “develop the knowledge
practices, a knowledge base” (Hunt, 2016). The threshold concepts were often referred to
as “nebulous” (Hunt, 2016), but purposefully so in order that they could be variously
applied. As a participant in the webinar, I noted that it seemed “very chicken and the

23
egg-like.” Which comes first, the knowledge practice or the disposition? Does one ever
come first, or are they continuously changing and developing in relation to each
other? Another recurring question during the webinar had to do with measurement. How
would such nebulous concepts, practices, and dispositions be measured, if the possibility
even exists? Participants in the webinar suggested that the Framework need not
necessarily replace the Standards, but that the two structures should complement one
another (Hunt, 2016).
Reflection upon the research results in comparison to the Framework suggested
the need for further study and possible application of it in relation to the information
literacy levels of beginning nursing students. The Framework was heavily influenced by
the theory of Metaliteracy (discussed later) and provided an expanded definition of
Information Literacy based upon its tenets:

Information literacy is the set of integrated abilities encompassing the
reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is
produced and valued, and the use of information in creating new knowledge and
participating ethically in communities of learning (ACRL, 2015).

This new definition of information literacy with its iterative, cyclical idea of information
literacy presented a clearer concept of the information continuum on which nursing
students may find themselves. Although published after the research protocol was
established, the development of the Framework definition helped in the visualization of
information literacy, as well as EBP, as ever-evolving, individualized, yet connected,

24
domains. The Framework will be revisited in the Chapter Five discussion of future
implications and research.

Nursing Association References to Information Literacy
The American Association of Colleges of Nursing stresses EBP in The Essentials
of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice [Essentials], and these
will be examined more fully in the later EBP discussion. However, it should be noted that
the Essentials do specifically refer to information literacy. For example, among the nine
outcomes for which the nursing baccalaureate program should prepare a nurse is the
ability to “[U]se skills of inquiry, analysis, and information literacy to address
practice issues” (2008, 12). Additionally, the Essentials includes the statement,
“Computer and information literacy are crucial to the future of nursing” (2008, 17). The
Essentials provided corroboration from the nursing profession, not just the nursing
faculty of the Campus that the nursing profession is embracing the somewhat nebulous
idea of information literacy as an important component of EBP and of the nursing
profession in the 21st century. The AACN does not have an Essentials for associate level
nurses; the baccalaureate level Essentials was referred to as graduates of both associate
degree and baccalaureate degrees both sit for the “same NCLEX-RN licensing
examination” (AACN, 2015).

25
Information Literacy Requirement for Student Nurses at the College
Establishment of the requirement. The faculty of the district-wide nursing
department of Large Metropolitan Community College (hereafter referred to as “the
College”) have been concerned about the low level of information literacy—and, thus the
ability to successfully engage in EBP nursing—of not only their current nursing students,
but their graduated practicing nurses as well. Over a period of six years, the nursing
faculty of the College had re-envisioned and re-developed the nursing curriculum,
including incorporating a required information literacy/library research course,
Introduction to Library and Online Research (LIB 101, discussed below), as a prerequisite to the nursing program, effective Fall 2013. Although the general education
program of the College does not require such a course, the nursing faculty determined
that one was necessary for the nursing program. The College Nursing Program
Handbook characterizes Associate Degree nurses as making a “commitment to
continuous learning and self-development,” and that they should be able to “use[s]
nursing research findings to improve practice” [to continuously learn in the profession via
EBP] as an expected graduate competency (St. Louis Community College, 2013, 6-7).
LIB 101. Introduction to Library and Online Research (LIB 101) is a one-credit
hour course through which students explore and learn about searching, evaluating, using,
and citing information resources from the open web, from the College library catalog,
and from the College library databases. The LIB 101 course profile, including the course
objectives and the student learning outcomes, were heavily influenced by the ACRL
Standards and can be reviewed in Appendix A.

26

Nursing faculty interest in the research. The nursing faculty at one of the
College campuses, [hereafter referred to as “the Campus”], were interested in how such a
pre-requisite would affect the information literacy knowledge and skills of the nursing
students at the College, particularly those students in the introductory nursing course,
Fundamentals of Nursing [NUR 101]. Informal discussions with nursing faculty
addressed the lack of credible, much less professional, resources students were
increasingly depending upon for outside research assignments such as case studies and
care plans. Although students’ lack of research skills is bemoaned across the disciplines,
the Campus nursing faculty referred to the increased importance in the health professions
where life or death circumstances that can arise from poor practice. They further
explained the College nursing faculty decision to add the pre-requisite LIB 101 when
other important pre-requisites were removed (such as a second college composition
course) as based upon a desire for nursing students to enter the program already
knowledgeable about finding a scholarly article in a nursing journal and already
understanding why nurses should not rely upon search engines such as Google or popular
websites such as WebMD for medical information. The nursing faculty stressed that the
curriculum is already tightly scheduled and barely provides the time to address all the
nursing learning outcomes needed for nurses to pass the certification board
examinations. They could not spend valuable nursing instruction time on information
access and evaluation and hoped that the pre-requisite would help improve student
nurses’ EBP abilities. Ultimately, the nursing faculty wanted evidence to support their
change in curriculum and to know if the LIB 101 prerequisite “did what…was hoped”

27
and “met [their] needs” (L. Kaufman & J. Walsh, personal communication, March 18,
2013; L. Kaufman, personal communication, April 29, 2013; L. Kaufman, personal
communication, May 3, 2013; L. Kaufman & L. Kokotovich, personal communication,
August 27, 2013).
Library faculty interest in the research. The library faculty of the Campus
were likewise interested in the effect of LIB 101 on the nursing students. While Campus
library faculty had had supporters among other discipline and subject faculty—faculty
who regularly invited them to instruct their students in information literacy—nursing was
the first (and remains the only) department to collectively express the need for systematic
information literacy instruction of their students. Library faculty were thrilled that
faculty from another discipline had not only endorsed library and information instruction
as helpful, but had specifically required it in their curriculum. They hoped that the
course, which was open to all students, not necessarily nursing students, would deliver
the adequate background anticipated by the nurses. The library faculty believed that the
generalized course instruction and activities, while remaining open to other disciplines
and subject areas, provided avenues for pre-nursing students to gain the information
literacy background needed to successfully complete the nursing curriculum. However,
the library faculty, perhaps more so than the nursing faculty, wanted evidence to either
support that belief or to suggest possible adjustments to the course (D. Schmitt, R.
Helbling, J. Hovis, personal communication, Spring 2013-Spring 2015).

28
Pre-Dissertation Research
Two previously completed projects in which I was involved helped guide the
development of the dissertation research. The first, part of a college-wide General
Education assessment in 2008, included an assignment assessment of anonymized
English Composition papers regarding the number and quality of sources used as well as
the frequency of attribution. The assignment assessment provided me with a better
understanding of the information literacy performance of students than what I had held
previously based upon various instruction and classroom assessment techniques during
library instruction sessions, such as “muddiest point” and “one minute” essays (Angelo &
Cross, 1993).
My earlier (proposed Fall 2011, completed Spring 2012) sabbatical project
investigating the effect of the General Transfer Degree program on the information
literacy levels of students at the College was instrumental to the development of the
dissertation research (Smith, 2012). The Sabbatical project considered if there was
evidence that students at the College gained information literacy skills during the General
Education program. Samples of students at the four campuses of the College in both the
developmental/remedial college orientation course and the general education capstone
course were included in the study to compare skills at the beginning and at the end of the
General Transfer Degree (Smith, 2012). Lessons I learned during the project that
influenced the dissertation research included:
● incorporating an “I don’t know” option in the knowledge assessment tool to
discourage lucky guesses.

29
● concentrating on one Campus, rather than the collective College.
● obtaining buy-in from the full contingent of faculty (only a small percentage of
the orientation and capstone faculty district wide agreed to participate).
● offering a higher dollar enticement. A $20 gift card was an insufficient amount to
entice community college students—who are rarely on campus except for
classwork due to heavy workloads, familial responsibilities, and other conflicts—
to either remain on campus or return to campus to participate in focus groups.
Overview of Dissertation
Overview of the Literature Review. An extensive literature review was
completed to provide a solid foundation and working theoretical framework. This
research combines two ideas: “information literacy” and “evidence based practice
nursing.” The latter follows the former in that an information literate person can
effectively, efficiently, and ethically access and use appropriate information sources
relative to his or her need (based upon the ACRL Standards). The information literate
practitioner of evidence based nursing, therefore, effectively, efficiently, and ethically
accesses and uses the best information appropriate to the medical and non-medical needs
of his or her patient. How then would the information literacy of a practitioner of
evidence based nursing be measured?
A number of theoretical frameworks and/or models were appraised and aspects of
each were incorporated into the research process. Two concepts related to what the
nursing students do not know, Anomalous States of Knowledge and Competency and

30
Confidence, also provided important foundational understanding to the research process.
Nursing students may not know that they should know more about academic resources
and may feel confident in their ability to find and use inappropriate resources from an
open web search engine or possibly from their mobile phone’s basic voice driven
information application. Nurses, as well as well as nursing students, may also be affected
by computer and/or information anxiety; the concepts of information, library, and
computer anxiety were also important to consider. The information literate practitioner
of evidenced based nursing would need to have the confidence to find and use
information from unfamiliar resources, many of which are only accessible online. Other
frameworks related to Information Behavior investigated included Chatman’s four
concepts of Information Poverty and her work with Small Worlds. The population to be
studied was composed of community college students, a demographic often considered to
be economically disadvantaged. Such students might be hesitant to step out of their
trusted circles of family and friends—and, as they become nurses—nurse colleagues.
Because nurses have a high level of responsibility—they literally hold human
lives in their hands—nursing can be considered a high reliability organizational (Weick,
1987). As with any medical field, as patients are individuals, there is no opportunity for
nurses to regularly experiment with trial and error. Nurses must rely upon their previous
knowledge and the shared knowledge of the community within their healthcare
setting. As the nursing literature suggests, the shared knowledge is local and limited—an
important concept to consider when developing the assessment design.

31
Overview of the Research Question. The literature review examined
information literacy assessment techniques ranging from informal classroom assessments
of short, guest lectures to institution-based testing for course outcomes assessment and
for testing out of credit based courses, to formal, standardized assessments, such as
Project SAILS (Project SAILS, 2012). Additionally, the literature review also covered
instruction and assessment of information literacy in relation to evidence based nursing,
as well as obstacles to their stated ideal (the information-literate EBP nurse). Within the
nursing literature, research into the evidence based practice abilities of practicing nurses
and into various methods of information literacy instruction and their effectiveness was
reviewed. The effects of a separate information literacy course, adopted as a prerequisite, rather than a nursing-specific information literacy intervention, had not been
studied. This led to the following overarching research questions:


Conceptual Question: How does the completion of a one-credit hour
information literacy course affect the information behavior and the
information literacy skills of samples of students in an introductory nursing
course?



Research Question: Specifically, how does a sample of Fundamentals of
Nursing (NUR 101) students who have had no prior formal information
literacy instruction locate, access, and use information compared to a sample
of NUR 101 students who have completed the one credit hour Introduction to
College and Online Literacy (LIB 101)?

Specifically, the study addressed the following questions:

32
1. What resources do students in the samples tend to rely on for research, and
why do they rely upon them? (Source Selection)

2. How do students in the samples tend to evaluate and to verify—to determine
credibility and reliability—of information resources? (Source Evaluation)

3. Do students in the samples understand the idea of scholarly research published
in peer reviewed resources? Can they recognize it and do they know how to
find it? (Identification of Scholarly Resources)

4. How do nursing students in their first program semester search for health
and/or other information? Do they understand basic keyword search
techniques? (Use of Keyword Search Techniques)

Overview of the Methodology. A convergent parallel designed mixed-methods
investigation addressed the research questions regarding the basic information literacy
levels of students in NUR 101, the introductory nursing course. The investigation
assessed two groups—one enrolled in NUR 101 prior to the establishment of the LIB 101
pre-requisite and the second enrolled in NUR 101 after completing the pre-requisite of
LIB 101. The research was undertaken to determine such basic information literacy
levels before and after the implementation of the LIB 101 pre-requisite via individual
student knowledge-based assessments administered to both groups, as well as by holding
student interviews and/or focus groups with a representative sample from both groups.

33
Overview of the Findings.
1. What resources do students in the samples tend to rely on for research, and why
do they rely upon them? The resources relied upon by the students was addressed
in both the student knowledge-based assessment and in the interviews. Overall,
the frequencies of assessment answers suggested that students, regardless of
completion, relied most heavily on open web sites, with some additional reliance
on library databases and on textbooks. However, in the interviews, the nursing
students who had completed LIB 101 had realized the weaknesses of the open
web—even when they witnessed nursing professionals using it.
2. How do students in the samples tend to evaluate and to verify —to determine
credibility and reliability—of information resources? While there was not a
significant relationship between the two samples addressing the question in the
knowledge-based assessment, the interviews provided evidence that students
found the open web unreliable and were often disappointed in their search
results—however, that disappointment and unreliability were not considered
serious enough compared with convenience for students to exclude them. The
interviews also indicated that students are aware of the need critically evaluate
information—and that they are poor critical thinkers.

3. Do students in the samples understand the idea of scholarly research published in
peer reviewed resources? Can they recognize it and do they know how to find
it? Results were mixed: Hypothesis c was statistically supported by Question 8

34
of the quantitative portion of the study, but analyses of the other related questions
did not provide any evidence of a relationship between the scholarly article
related queries and course completion. Evidence from the interviews suggested
that students who completed LIB 101 not only understand the concept of
scholarly articles as published in academic journals, but also feel prepared to find
them, whereas students who did not complete LIB 101 feel ill-prepared to do so.

4. Both the quantitative and qualitative studies suggested that the first sample of
students does not feel comfortable with searching in general, while students from
the second sample feel comfortable with using keyword search
techniques. Evidence suggested that the sample of students who had completed
LIB 101 could correctly utilize Boolean operators in appropriate collections
whereas students who had not completed LIB 101 were unaware of Boolean
searching.

The evidence provided by the project in its entirety suggests that, yes; students who
complete LIB 101 prior to enrollment in NUR 101 significantly demonstrate better
information literacy behavior than the students who do not complete the information
literacy course.
Contributions to the Field. While the study is valuable to the nursing and
Library faculty of the Campus, its importance extends beyond the boundaries of the
Campus and of the College. The future of nursing worldwide relies upon evidence based
practice, and, ultimately, evidence based practice relies on information literate nurses.

35
This study can contribute to a better understanding of the information literacy levels
demanded by evidence based nursing by providing supporting data as to the levels of
incoming nursing students who have and who have not completed a one-credit-hour
information literacy pre-requisite.

36
Chapter Two:
Literature Review
An extensive literature review was completed to provide a solid foundation and
working theoretical framework for this study. The literature review focused on two
ideas: “information literacy” and “evidence based practice nursing.” The latter follows
the former in that an information literate person can effectively, efficiently, and ethically
access and use appropriate information sources relative to his or her need (based upon the
ACRL Standards). The information literate practitioner of evidence based nursing;
therefore, effectively, efficiently, and ethically accesses and uses the best information
appropriate to the medical and non-medical needs of his or her patient. How then would
the information literacy of a practitioner of evidence based nursing be assessed,
evaluated, and/or measured? This literature review will examine pertinent theoretical
frameworks and the applications of the frameworks to the assessment of information
literacy, followed by an exploration of information literacy assessment at the
undergraduate level, and culminating in an investigation of information literacy and/or
evidence based practice in nursing education and professional practice.
Theories and Frameworks
Information Behavior, a subset of Information Science, is concerned with how
information is sought and used. Information theories and frameworks considered during
the development and the application of the research are individually described below with

37
a brief allusion to its impact followed by a discussion of how the theories interconnected
in the research project.
Anomalous States of Knowledge. The idea that individuals do not realize what
they do not know or what they ought to know forms the basis for Nicholas Belkin’s
theory of Anomalous States of Knowledge (ASK). Belkin theorized that, at a cognitive
level, a “user’s state of knowledge with respect to a topic is in some way inadequate with
respect to the person’s ability to achieve some goal” (Belkin, 2005, 45). This inadequacy
could be due to a number of different problems—not only the lack of knowledge. The
underlying support to the ASK hypothesis is the “cognitive viewpoint” (Belkin, 2005,
46), which is the idea:
that any processing of information, whether perceptual or symbolic, is mediated
by a system of categories or concepts which, for the information-processing
device, are a model of his world. (Belkin, 46, quoting de Mey 1977, p. xvii)
Belkin’s ASK hypothesis attempts to “explain why people integrate in informationseeking behavior, and how that reason can be responded to through a person’s interaction
with information (Belkin, 2005, 47). The cognitive viewpoint, however, presents
questions as to its inherent dismissal of information as social phenomena. Bernd
Frohmann posited that the cognitive viewpoint removes external influences of society—
of social sciences such as history, politics, etc.—from information. Frohmann argued
that this diminution of “social practices” to “a noumenal reality” (1992, 376) suggested
that information must then be governed by natural laws; and he, via the cognitive
viewpoint, likened information (needs, use, behavior) to commodities within capitalism

38
(368). Frohmann concluded that “ ‘use-centric’ promise of the cognitive viewpoint is
compromised” (384) and cannot provide a comprehensive LIS framework with which to
approach an understanding of information and information behavior. ASK provided an
important layer in the theoretical frameworks supporting the research into the nursing
students with the idea that many such students may have little to no idea of open and
closed access resources to support their profession; yet, taking Frohmann’s critique into
account, societal influences on the students’ cognitive viewpoint must also be considered.
Competency and Confidence. Gross and Latham conducted multiple studies of
students, particularly university undergraduate and community college students, to
determine not only the information literacy skills of students, but, to also measure the
students’ views of their skills utilizing a psychological framework based upon the
Dunning-Kuger theory: that those who are incompetent do not realize their
incompetence, while those with developed skills often outperform what they estimate that
they can achieve (Kruger & Dunning, 1999; Latham, 2011; Latham & Gross, 2008).
Theoretically, they advocated that as “competence is developed, an individual’s ability to
self-assess also improves” (Latham & Gross, 2012, 581). Gross and Latham provided
evidence that college and university students with low levels of information literacy skills
“tend to greatly overestimate their skills,” and, because of this, believe that they do not
need instruction in information literacy (Gross & Latham 2009, 430). Their research
suggested that, at least in the realm of information literacy, “confidence is not a reliable
predictor of competence” (Latham & Gross, 2008, n.p.) Additionally, Gross and Latham
submitted that students with low competency levels of information literacy “prefer people

39
and the Internet as sources” (Latham & Gross, 2013, 445). Competency and Confidence,
like ASK, provided two important aspects to incorporate into the research—the first
concerning the possibility that nursing students overestimate their ability to find nursing
information and the second regarding a possible reliance on other nurses as “people” and
Google as the “internet” for information (Latham & Gross, 2013, 445).
Metaliteracy. Thomas Mackey and Trudi Jacobson contended that the
“[s]tandard definitions of information literacy [were] insufficient” to reflect the
“revolutionary social technologies” of the digital age (2011, 63). In response, they
developed metaliteracy as a framework with which to study information literacy in
relation to other necessary 21st century technologies and literacies as they emerge and
develop, such as social media, media literacy, and computer literacy. Metaliteracy
removed the focus of information literacy skills from a “discrete” “skills-based approach
to learning” to one focused on critical thinking in relation to the collaborative digital
environment (70) and metacognition. Although Mackey and Jacobson proposed
metaliteracy as a new concept, others had previously recommended similar expansions to
the idea of information literacy. For example, Simmons faulted information literacy—as
defined by the ACRL Standards as well as by “the voluminous published literature”—for
“focus[ing] narrowly on the acquisition of skills” (2005, 299). Simmons called for
instruction librarians to provide students with a “meta-awareness” (302) by instructing
them in the “larger philosophical, economic, and social issues surrounding information”
(300). Pilerot also found the concept of metaliteracy “somewhat problematic” as she saw
metaliteracy causing information literacy to become “defined in relation to tools rather

40
than to knowledge” (2014, n.p.). Pilerot’s critique regarding “tools" suggested that
metaliteracy might mire information literacy in early 21st century instruments (i.e., social
media) rather than transcend resource formats. Metaliteracy remained an important
concept to consider in the research as nurses must be well versed in the tools of both
medicine and information science. As these tools--for both medicine and information
science--continue to evolve, perhaps metaliteracy should be examined as environments
and tools change; nevertheless, it should also not limit itself to specific segments of
environmental and tool evolutions. The knowledge and ability should transcend specific
tool operation.
Anxiety. Mellon (1986) and Wurman (1989) used the term “anxiety” to define
the overwhelmed, frustrated, and fearful feelings information users can experience when
confronted by an unfamiliar information resource or by too much information. Mellon
originated the term Library Anxiety as a result of her two-year qualitative study of writing
students. She found that over seventy-five percent of the students “described their initial
response to the library in terms of fear or anxiety” (1986, 162). Mellon, as well as
Onwuegbuzie, Jiao, and Bostick, discussed library anxiety as only affecting those
students who use or are considering using library resources (Mellon, 1986, 162;
Onwuegbuzie et al., 2004, 30). Wurman more expansively identified Information
Anxiety as the fear and frustration “produced by the ever-widening gap between what we
understand and what we think we should understand” (1989, 34). Computer anxiety was
described by Simonson, Maurer, Montag Torardi, & Whitaker as a sense of fear
experienced when one uses, or thinks about using, a computer (1987). The research of

41
Beckers, Wicherts, & Schmidt suggested that computer anxiety has a greater basis in a
stable personality "trait," rather than a temporary "state" (2007, 2860); the condition is
not limited to the old, the uneducated, nor the inexperienced computer user. Thus, they
suggest that even digital natives are susceptible to computer anxiety and that there is no
quick fix for it (Beckers, Schmidt, & Wicherts, 2008, 19). Library, information, and
computer anxiety were crucial to the development of the study. Steps taken to minimize
uncertainty and anxiety will be further addressed in the methodology.
High Reliability Organizational Culture. While nurses certainly face time
pressures and efficiency measures, they are more importantly responsible for human life
and safety. Thus, the profession is based upon a high reliability organization (HRO),
defined by Weick as a collaborative body “in which reliability is a more pressing issue
than efficiency” (1987, 12). This is an important construct to consider because HRO
have, according to Weick, “unique problems in learning and understanding” that could
negatively impact performance when no solution is attained (12), such as the limited or
inability to learn by trial and error. Reliable performance, then, is dependent upon the
provision of alternatives to learning by trial and error. Weick posited that “stories” and
“simulations,” as alternatives, should increase the reliability of the organization because
the individuals belonging to the organization can have a greater knowledge of the system
and of the possible “errors that might occur” (113). Additionally, because the individuals
are aware of how others have approached and resolved possible errors, they are more
confident in their ability to handle new errors as they arise. Although Weick focused for
the most part on air traffic controllers and nuclear reactor operators, he does specifically

42
refer to the nursing profession in regards to obstacles to reliability: “nurses commit
medical errors when they forget that the chart is not the patient” (120). To be highly
reliable, HROs require both decentralization and centralization (124): in the nursing
profession, it could be theorized that nurses must have the variety of stories and
simulations (via research and case studies) in lieu of trial and error; yet, they must also
build a culture of shared beliefs and ideals (as opposed to standards and tradition based
nursing).
HRO culture greatly impacted my view of the importance of information literacy
in the nursing arena. In the greater community college view, information literacy may be
thought of as important to creating a well-informed citizenry; however, within the context
of an HRO, information literacy can be understood as vital to effective patient care with a
possible greater dependence on a community built upon shared evidence and shared
responsibility. The idea that nursing should be considered an HRO was corroborated by
the research of Quigley and White (2013). Although it was published after this research
project was devised, Quigley and White provided evidence that the theoretical framework
of an HRO can be successfully applied to nursing and to other medical situations—
particularly to hospital-based fall measurement and improvement. Quigley and White
proposed a model to evaluate a program intended to result in a reduction of patient falls
in the hospital setting which included “organizational, unit, and patient level data” and
“shared responsibility” among stakeholders (2013). They concluded that such a model
not only appropriately views the hospital setting as an HRO, but also facilitates
evaluation. They suggested that the adoption of such a model in investigations into a

43
variety of hospital based questions could help to identify and highlight best practices in
“safe hospitals” (2013). The HRO of nursing units can be thought to also be tied to the
ACRL Nursing Standards in that information is not only to be found “efficiently”—but
“effectively” (ACRL, 2013).
Small Worlds and Information Poverty. Chatman developed the theory of
Information Poverty in an attempt to explain how members of disadvantaged groups can
be impacted by perceptions of self-doubt and by fears of taking information risks, thus
remaining information poor (1996, 205). Influenced by the idea that information poverty
and economic poverty were linked (205), Chatman utilized multiple theoretical
frameworks to research and devise a theory of information poverty, including theories of
insiders/outsiders, gratification, alienation, and diffusion. Chatman utilized Wilson’s
idea of a small world—“a constricted place of information, a narrow psychological
space” (Wilson, 1983, 152) to research how the economically disadvantaged meet their
information needs within the confines of their limited circles. Although a 2001 article
(Burnett, Besant, & Chatman) expanded the small worlds idea to additional circles,
Chatman primarily focused on the economically disadvantaged (1985, 1987, 1991) and
developed four fundamental concepts of information poverty: Secrecy, Deception, RiskTaking, and Situational Relevance/Utility (1996). From these concepts, Chatman
suggested six statements that collectively serve as a theoretical framework to describe
and further study the information poor:
1. People who are defined as information poor perceive themselves to be
devoid of any sources that might help them.

44
2. Information poverty is partially associated with class distinction. That is, the
condition of information poverty is influenced by outsiders who
withhold privileged access to information.
3. Information poverty is determined by self-protective behaviors which are
used in response to social norms.
4. Both secrecy and deception are self-protecting mechanisms due to a sense of
mistrust regarding the interest or ability of others to provide useful
information.
5. A decision to risk exposure about our true problems is often not taken
due to a perception that negative consequences outweigh benefits.
6. New knowledge will be selectively introduced into the information world of
poor people. A condition that influences this process is the relevance of that
information in response to everyday problems and concerns (197-8).

Her research also suggested that information poverty and economic poverty were not
necessarily related, but that the information poor belong to a "very localized …world[s]
in which norms and mores define what is important and what is not” (Chatman, 1996,
205). Ultimately, Chatman recognized the limits of the Theory of Information Poverty,
and she stressed the need for further research (1996, 205).
Nurses, as professionals, may not be thought of as affected by the theory of
Information Poverty. However, health care does have a variety of hierarchical
distinctions. Although state regulations differ, Registered Nurses (RNs) are usually
licensed by examination and may have earned an associate’s (ADN) and/or a bachelor’s

45
(BSN) in nursing. In the nursing hierarchy, they outrank licensed practical nurses
(LPNs), but, in turn, are eclipsed by advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) who
have earned at least a Master’s in Nursing (MSN) and often a Doctor of Nursing Practice
(DNP) or a PhD. APRNs also must pass specific certifications. For example, to become
a certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) a nurse must complete an accredited
graduate level program and pass the National Certification Examination (NCE) by the
National Board of Certification and Recertification for Nurse Anesthetists (NBCRNA).
CRNAs additionally must complete at least 40 hours of continuing education and
recertify every 2 years (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015).
Additionally, regardless of the nursing hierarchy, nurses are typically viewed in a lower
class than physicians in the hierarchies of healthcare.
Within the confines of the research project, it was found to be a fruitful
framework for identifying some of the problems of Campus students, many of whom
meet Chatman’s criteria of information poor. Community colleges have traditionally
been thought of as comprising a proportionately large number of disadvantaged
students—mainly disadvantages stemming from socio-economic issues (income poverty,
digital divide, first generation college student, etc.). The composite Campus student
profile paralleled such an understanding: the average Campus student was aged 28 years
(a non-traditional student with gaps in education and in technology familiarity), and
attended school part-time while working full-time and/or part-time. Additionally, the
composite Campus student was not only reliant on financial aid, but also required extraagency public and private assistance. (St. Louis Community College, n.d.). The theory of

46
Information Poverty, although critiqued by Chatman herself, impacted both the way that
the students were defined, and also the way that research was completed; I purposefully
tried to minimize the possibility of embarrassing, intimidating, or causing discomfort to
students who may have adopted “self-protective behaviors” and “self-protecting
mechanisms” due to information poverty (Chatman, 2006, 197-8).
Undergraduate Information Literacy Studies.
The difficulty in designing an examination of information literacy in regards to
students at The College lay not in the scarcity of options, but, conversely, in the
abundance as there were no discipline specific ideal institutional templates found.
Additionally problematic was the lack of a specific assignment which could be assessed-negating the possibility of assessment ideas traditionally linked to information literacy,
such as document review of student bibliographies (Hinchliffe, Kubiak & Hunt, 2003;
Belanger, J., Zou, Rushing Mills, Holmes, & Oakleaf, 2015; Carbery & Leahy, 2015; and
Lowe, Booth, Stone, & Tagge, 2015) or essays describing the research process (Nutefall,
2014). Thus, studies in a variety of disciplines, including nursing and general studies,
were reviewed; and, Information Literacy specifically related to nursing and EBP will be
further investigated later under Re-envisioning Nursing Education.
Assessment Tool. A review of previous information literacy assessment which
focused on general studies ranged from assessment of full credit information literacy
courses (Daugherty & Russo, 2011; Hufford, 2010; Larsen, Izenstark, & Burkhardt,
2010) to that of information literacy content presented in courses of other disciplines
(Johnson, Anelli, Galbraith, & Green; 2011). While these were helpful for overarching

47
ideas and discussions of the methodology and results, they did not help with the creation
of the assessment tools. Assessment tools as addressed in the literature included formal
testing, such as the Information Literacy Test originally developed by the James Madison
University (JMU) Center for Assessment and Research Studies and the JMU Libraries
(Madison Assessment, 2012) and the Project SAILS (Standardized Assessment of
Information Literacy Skills) (Project SAILS, 2012) originally developed by Kent State
University, as well as those developed by outside agencies, such as the Educational
Testing Service (ETS)'s iSkills assessment (Educational Testing Service, 2012; Katz,
2007). These proprietary resources were helpful when considering measurable tools;
however, because they were proprietary, I had limited access to the actual tools as
opposed to descriptions of the tools. Additionally, the limited access obtained suggested
that the assessment questions were focused more upon course or program learning
outcomes and not more generalized information literacy proficiency. For example,
Project SAILS included a question requiring students to identify parts of Superintendent
of Documents Classification System (SuDoc) item records (Project SAILS, 2012). As
such outcomes were beyond those of either the ACRL Standards or the AACN
Essentials, Project SAILS was considered as a possible multiple choice format example,
but not for the actual assessment questions.
Interviews, Focus Groups, and Observations. Another form of research
included focus groups with other subject faculty to assess competencies (Tyron, Frigo, &
O'Kelly, 2010). While the research project was not going to focus on faculty viewpoints,
I gained some insight and some ideas as to the development of the nursing student focus

48
group protocol by informally meeting and discussing nursing research assignments with
the nursing faculty. Additionally, observations of classroom activities (Bellard, 2005;
Sundin & Francke, 2009) as well as of information literacy instructional sessions
(Helbling, K., conference presentation, “Authentic Assessment: Evaluating the Growth of
Student Research Skills,” Missouri Library Association Annual Conference, Oct. 6, 2011;
Swoger (2011) suggested the incorporation of observations of students. Although based
on observations in “one-shot” session classes, the presentation and the article provided
ways in which observation of a task might be used within an interview or focus group
situation. Ultimately, observation was not included in the protocol as the use of the
library—even the library website—was thought to possibly influence students in their
information seeking.
Nursing and Evidence Based Practice (Nursing Information Literacy Studies).
Evidence based practice is “the integration of individual clinical expertise and
patient preferences and values with the best available external clinical evidence from
systematic research” (Sackett, Straus, Richardson, Rosenberg, & Haynes, 2000).
Healthcare stakeholders, including professional organizations, federal agencies, and even
insurers, have acknowledged that EBP not only improves patient outcomes, but that it
also lowers healthcare costs (Melnyk & Fineout-Overholt, 2011). Nursing literature has
long referred to the necessity of information literacy, as required for EBP, primarily due
to the positive effects of EBP nursing on patient outcomes as opposed to outcomes from
tradition/expert opinion based nursing (Heater, Becker, & Olson, 1988). However, such
sentiments are often coupled with lamentation that patient care based on EBP is not

49
regularly delivered by healthcare practitioners (McGinty & Anderson, 2008; Melnyk et
al., 2005); when it is, it is often based upon information informally gained from
colleagues, not from nursing literature (Marshall, West & Aiken, 2011). Hart (2008)
reviewed extant literature related to “informatics competency” (321) and practicing
nurses in the United States and found “a large number of gaps in the nursing profession
that render US nurses unprepared for evidence-based practice” (328) stemming from the
problem that not only had competencies for nurses only been defined in 2002, but also
that a true baseline had not yet been determined.
Barriers to EBP. The literature does provide insight into why healthcare
practitioners, particularly nurses, do not deliver evidence based care. Pravikoff, Tanner,
and Pierce (2005) surveyed nurses across the United States and found that among the
respondents:
● Only 46% recognized the term “evidence based practice.”
● While 61% reported needing to find information on the job, 58% reported not
referring to research reports and over 80% had never utilized the resources of a
hospital library.
● 76% had never used the CINAHL database and 58% had never used the
MEDLINE databases—77% reported that they had “never received instruction in
the use of electronic resources.”
Ultimately, Pravikoff, Tanner, and Pierce determined that “RNs in the United States
aren’t ready for evidence-based practice” (2005, 50).

50
The problem is not limited to the United States. Majid et al. (2011), found in a
study of Singapore nurses that the majority surveyed could not apply an “appropriate
search strategy” for nursing related topics. Just as their U.S. counterparts do,
Singaporean nurses relied upon colleagues’ knowledge and experience more willingly
than on published clinical evidence, paralleling the previously referred to findings of
Chatman and of Gross and Latham in regards to preferred resources. Similarly, O’Leary
and Mhaolrunaigh found that when making clinical decisions, nurses in Ireland most
often relied upon their colleagues--suggesting Chatman’s Small Worlds--and
“prepackaged” information (such as hospital guidelines) rather than accessing medical
literature (2012). Nationally and internationally, the nursing literature suggests a need for
information literacy to be included in nurse preparation and continuing education.
In the defense of these nurses, the literature also provides evidence of various
impediments to EBP:
● Lack of time (primarily due to demanding patient caseloads as well as
understaffing)
● Little or no instruction and/or experience in:


EBP



Information Literacy



Information Technology

● Negative attitudes about EBP stemming from misconceptions
● An environment that does not encourage EBP within the healthcare field

51
● Lack of resources (access to hospital library databases, print journals, etc.)
(Pagoto et al., 2007; Pravikoff, Tanner, & Pierce, 2005)
Furthermore, as a number of states, including Missouri, do not require any continuing
education for RN licensure (American Nurses Association, 2011); there is often no
incentive nor are there available opportunities for practicing nurses to overcome such
barriers. The College nursing faculty added the Information Literacy requirement in an
attempt to prepare the College nursing graduates for EBP.
Re-envisioning Nursing Education. The National League for Nursing (NLN)
continued its 2003 mandate for a new form of nursing education, including outcomes
relating to EBP in its 2005 Position Statement. However, as the NLN itself noted, while
“tomorrow’s education must be researched based” (2005, 1); such a “transformation” has
yet to emerge (NLN, 2005, 3). Nayda and Rankin found that students in a BSN program
did not understand the concept of information literacy, nor did they understand its role in
successful nursing education and professional practice (2008). Pravikoff, Tanner, &
Pierce advocated “that information literacy, research use, and evidenced-based practice
are [sic] integrated into the curricula of all RN education programs” (2005, 50). Barnard,
Nash, and O’Brien were less all-inclusive, suggested that “meaningful” partnerships
should be cultivated between librarians and nursing faculty (2005, 505). The following
articles address the inclusion of EBP or information literacy instruction as an important
component of nursing education and focus on a variety of approaches. Reflecting upon
these inclusion attempts helped to solidify the project hypotheses and protocol.

52
Integrated Curriculum. Pre-dating the NLN’s 2003 mandate, Shorten, Wallace,
and Crookes (2001) researched the effects of a “curriculum integrated informationliteracy programme” as part of a course in the Bachelor of Nursing degree program at the
University of Wollongong, Australia. Although it was unclear as to which course
included the intervention, it was applied to a group of students in their first year of the
nursing program (Shorten, Wallace, & Crooks, 2001). The intervention was composed of
traditional lectures and “laboratory/tutorial sessions” presenting “three specific ‘librarybased’ learning activities and complementary assessment tasks, which were directly
related to the content area of their ‘fundamental clinical nursing’ subject” (Shorten,
Wallace, & Crookes, 2001). While it referred to neither the Dunning-Kruger Effect nor
to Gross and Latham, confidence and competence were at the heart of the study:
The teachers who implemented and evaluated the curriculum-integrated
information-literacy programme had a strong philosophical stance that the
purpose of the programme was more than merely to provide the students with
skills and knowledge for the development of information literacy. They
considered that if students felt confident in their electronic database searching
then they would be more likely to 'give it a go' and that this experience of learning
would lead to competence. Great care was taken by all the teaching staff, and in
particular by the faculty librarian, to ensure that the teaching and learning
activities were designed in such a way as to enhance the likelihood that students
would encounter 'successful searching' as their first experience of the library's
electronic databases (Shorten, Wallace, & Crookes, 2001).

53
Additionally, the assessment of the integrated curriculum program was twofold: to assess
not only the students’ information literacy skill attainment, but to also assess “changes in
student confidence level in searching for information” (Shorten, Wallace, & Crookes,
2001). The treatment group who completed the program took both a pre- and a postprogram assessment; the control group (a group of second-year students who had not
completed the program) also took the post-program assessment. The evaluation included
both a scored objective assessment and a “self-assessment of confidence” (Shorten,
Wallace, & Crookes). The authors reported that the difference between the control and
the treatment groups’ answers on the objective assessment were significant while only
some of the self-assessment of skills were significantly different. Anecdotal evidence
was reported that indicated that the treatment group continued to better perform the
control group through their third year of the nursing program. There was no indication if
their confidence levels remained higher in regards to some of the skills—how might
confidence and competency have affected the study?
Online Tutorials. Two studies (Weiner et. al, 2012; Edwards & O’Connor, 2011)
investigated the effects of online tutorials aimed to improve information literacy. While
both involved the assessment of module tutorials, each focused less on information
literacy than on other ‘college’ ideas. Weiner, Pelaez, Chang, and Weiner (2012)
surveyed first year biology and first year nursing students to determine “the student
perspective on changes needed in online tutorials dealing with information literacy”
(196). The students were surveyed not for how well they learned or incorporated the
material, but how they perceived the tutorials. Surprisingly, although the students were

54
required to utilize primary research articles, the seven-module online tutorial did not
include library databases. Likewise, minimizing the role of information literacy in
nursing, Edwards and O’Connor researched the effects of a Blackboard module tutorial
developed by nursing faculty and “technology support staff” at a central Illinois
community college (2011, 15). The tutorial included seven modules, only one of which
focused on library resources and documentation. Although Module 6 focused on library
research and the APA citation format, the word “librarian” appears nowhere in the article,
while “information” appears only once. The assignments and pre- and post-survey
results were reviewed and analyzed by nursing faculty with some assistance from the
nursing advisors (Edwards & O’Connor, 2011, 5-6, 12). Per the surveys, students for the
most part responded favorably to questions regarding the instructional content; yet, they
responded negatively about “inaccessible faculty and a lack of technology
knowledge…on the part of some faculty” (Edwards & O’Connor, 2011, 13), which
suggests that the nursing faculty might have poor information literacy skills as evidenced
in the previously discussed studies of practicing nurses. The authors also noted the
challenges that faculty face in keeping nursing curriculum current—that two year nursing
programs are overloaded with content. This corresponds to the revision of the nursing
curriculum at the College, where the administrators have set a limit on the number of
credit hours that a nursing program can require within the program—including the prerequisites.
Ongoing Library Instructional Sessions. Duncan and Holtslander (2012) used
Charmaz’s Grounded Theory in a qualitative study of eleven senior (fourth year) nursing

55
students at a Western Canadian university. The eleven students attended library sessions
(of unspecified length and thoroughness) focusing on web site evaluation, source
comparison, keyword and subject searching, and some specific instruction on the
CINAHL database during their first year of nursing instruction at the technical institute.
During the third year of study (at the university), the students attended a second library
session that introduced the university’s web site and focused on nursing resources,
particularly CINAHL using subject heading searches. Although the authors noted that the
students considered themselves “confident about their search skills” (26), they
overwhelmingly expressed frustration in selecting keywords or in using subject headings
and struggled with searching both CINAHL and open web search engines. Duncan and
Holtslander noted that an emphasis on CINAHL is “essential” as it is a specific nursing
database; however, they also spoke to the difficulty students face when searching for
information more generally—especially when they do not know alternate keywords or
specific subject headings (2012).
Harkening back to Belkin, how do librarians and nursing faculty teach nursing
students to search for topics about which they know little? Additionally, where do
nursing students, in general, fit within the concept of information confidence as
investigated by Gross and Latham (2012)? Do they tend to see themselves as having
high level skills when, in reality, they do not have such skills? Does that level of
confidence transfer to their professional work after graduation? Such questions suggest
the need for investigation beyond the confines of the study.

56
Tutorials Combined with Librarian Instruction. Schutt (nursing faculty) and
Hightower (librarian) researched the effects of online instruction developed
collaboratively between nursing and the library (2009). The end result was a library
database tutorial module housed in WebCT complemented by librarian led face-to-face
and synchronous online instruction and discussion via Wimba for the RN-BSN
Educational Advancement for Registered Nurses (EARN program). This intervention
differed from previously related materials as the program student body was composed of
non-traditional students who had an average of 5 years nursing experience and because a
substantial portion of the program was delivered online. Prior to the intervention, the
students already attended a required orientation session, a “5-hour computer training
seminar” (Schutt & Hightower, 2009, 102) and had completed the one credit hour
Computers in Nursing course. The intervention module was comprised of three
instructional sessions, each followed by an assignment. The first assignment related to
the module had to do with resource selection. Less than half of the twenty-two students
who completed the assignment chose a relevant database. The second assignment
focused on Academic Search Premier, with a learning objective of using a database with
a wider scope to find two articles: one for patients and one for health care
professionals. While the 21 students who completed the assignment were able to find a
research article suitable for a healthcare professional, their findings of literature for
patients were of basic news information articles that did not demonstrate or explain
exercises—as the assignment required. For the third assignment, students were to
demonstrate the ability to develop fruitful search terms and to correctly incorporate

57
Boolean operators. Only six of the 22 students who completed the assignment did so
correctly. Overall, students provided “overwhelmingly positive” (104) feedback; one
student commented, “I believe the skills I have learned will help me in the EARN
program and the rest of my career” (104). Additionally, nursing faculty expressed the
idea that they, too, expanded upon their research skills through the process.
Evaluating Information from Websites. Information evaluation, particularly that
on the free web, has been conventionally taught by librarians and other information
professionals by the use of checklists of criteria (including such indicators as currency,
advertisements, author/creator credentials, objectivity, etc.) to establish credibility. Fallis
and Frické (2002) investigated the effectiveness of such criteria-based evaluation
techniques for determining accuracy of health-related websites. Their research failed to
find a correlation between such checklists and accuracy, suggesting that the traditional
checklist based instruction of evaluation needs further study and revision. In light of the
literature previously discussed concerning practicing nurses who have little or no access
to resources such as subscription databases and print journal collections, the need for
nursing students to learn effective ways of evaluating freely available resources for
accuracy becomes vital.
Summary
Frameworks related to what the nursing students do not know, particularly
Anomalous States of Knowledge and Competency and Confidence, provided important
foundational understanding to the research process. Nursing students may not know that
they should know more about academic resources and may feel confident in their ability

58
to find and use inappropriate resources from an open web search engine or possibly from
a mobile phone information application. The literature review also suggested that
practicing nurses may share the same concerns. Additional Information Behavior
theories developed by Chatman, specifically Information Poverty and Small Worlds,
regarding the disadvantaged were important to consider as the population to be studied
was composed of community college students, a demographic often considered to be
disadvantaged in many ways, including socio-economically and educationally. Such
students might be hesitant to step out of their trusted circles of family and friends—and,
as they become nurses—nurse colleagues. Other pertinent Information Behavior theories
which drove the research included Metaliteracy and Information and Computer Anxiety.
These were important to consider in the design of the protocol. For example, if a student
is uncomfortable using a computer, a navigation observation might be overwhelming,
frightening, and possibly harmful to him/her. Beyond Information Behavior, Weick’s
High Reliability Organization theory was also important to consider as nurses have high
levels of responsibility. Nurses must rely upon their previous knowledge and the shared
knowledge of the community within their healthcare setting, and, as the nursing literature
suggests, the shared knowledge is local and limited, cycling back to Chatman, Belkin,
and Gross and Latham.
The literature review examined information literacy assessment techniques, as
well as instruction and assessment of information literacy in relation to evidence based
nursing. Within the nursing literature, research into the evidence based practice abilities
of practicing nurses and into various methods of information literacy instruction and their

59
effectiveness was reviewed. The effects of a separate information literacy course,
adopted as a prerequisite, rather than a nursing-specific information literacy intervention,
had not been studied. This assessment led to the research questions and to the
methodology as addressed in Chapter Three, Methods.

60
Chapter Three:
Methods
The faculty of the district-wide nursing department of the College have grown
increasingly concerned with the low level of information literacy (and thus the ability to
successfully engage in evidence based practice nursing) of their current nursing students
and of their graduated practicing nurses. In spite of the College mandate limiting the
number of credit hours comprised in associate level programs—including any and all prerequisites—the nursing faculty of the College incorporated a required information
literacy/library research course, Introduction to Library and Online Research, (LIB 101),
as a pre-requisite to the nursing program in the newly re-envisioned and re-developed
nursing curriculum, effective for students entering the program as of Fall 2013. In
defending the pre-requisite to the college district and campus based curriculum
committees, the nursing faculty stressed the importance of graduating nurses who can
continue self-directed learning—especially that based on the ever changing health care
literature. The nursing faculty and the library faculty at one of the College campuses, the
Campus, were interested in how such a pre-requisite will affect the information literacy
abilities of the nursing students at the college, particularly those students in the
introductory nursing course, Fundamentals of Nursing, hereafter referred to as NUR 101.
What effects would the pre-requisite have—at least on student nurses? This research
project into the basic information literacy levels of students in NUR 101 assessed two
groups, the first of which was composed of students who enrolled in NUR 101 without
having taking the LIB 101 pre-requisite (the control group, hereafter referred to as

61
NOLIB). The second (the treatment group, hereafter referred to as LIB) was composed
of students who had enrolled in NUR 101 after completing the pre-requisite of LIB 101.
The research was undertaken to determine such basic information literacy levels before
and after the implementation of the LIB 101 pre-requisite via individual student
knowledge-based assessments administered to both groups, as well as by holding student
interviews and/or focus groups with a representative sample from both groups.
Through this study, the investigation attempted to address the research questions:

Conceptual Question: How does the completion of a one-credit hour information
literacy course affect the information behavior and the information literacy skills
of students in an introductory nursing course?

Research Question: Specifically, how does a sample of Fundamentals of Nursing
(NUR 101) students who have had no prior formal information literacy instruction
locate, access, and use information as compared to a sample of NUR 101 students
who have completed the one credit hour Introduction to College and Online
Literacy (LIB 101)?

Hypothesis: Students who complete LIB 101 prior to enrollment in NUR 101 will
demonstrate significantly better information literacy behavior than the students
who do not complete the information literacy pre-requisite.

62
In this study, information literacy behavior is manifest through four specific
behaviors: source selection, source evaluation, identification of scholarly
research, and appropriate use of information search techniques.

1. Source Selection

Question: What resources do students in the samples tend to rely on for
research, and why do they rely upon them?

Hypothesis 1a: NOLIB students will utilize limited open access collections of
information freely available to the general public. LIB students will know—
and know how—to utilize broader collections of information including library
databases and discipline-specific information.

Hypothesis 1b: NOLIB students will rely mostly on information with little or
no evaluation from the open web. LIB students will rely on resources with at
least a minimum of vetting via inclusion in a library catalog or database
collection.

2. Source Evaluation
Question: How do students in the samples tend to evaluate and to verify —to
determine credibility and reliability—of information resources?

63
Hypothesis 2: NOLIB students will not demonstrate an understanding of how
to evaluate information—especially that found on the open web. LIB students
will identify some means of evaluating information.

3. Identification of Scholarly Research

Question: Do students in the samples understand the idea of scholarly
research published in peer reviewed resources? Can they recognize it and do
they know how to find it?

Hypothesis 3: The NOLIB students will not recognize aspects of scholarly
research and will be unable to identify means of finding such research. The
LIB students will demonstrate a better understanding of the characteristics of
and the means of accessing scholarly research.

4. Use of Keyword Search Techniques

Question: How do nursing students in their first program semester search for
health and/or other information? Do they understand basic keyword search
techniques?

Hypothesis 4: The NOLIB students will not demonstrate the knowledge and
ability to determine search strategies. The LIB students will demonstrate the
ability to use Boolean operators and other keyword search strategies.

64
If librarians have a clearer understanding of such students’ information behavior,
librarians (and institutions of higher learning) might provide nursing students with more
understandable, relevant, and usable information literacy instruction. By improving the
instruction of information literacy concepts to the known information behavior of nursing
students, librarians can better help such students improve their understanding and use of
information, as well as their academic, professional, and life-long success. Ultimately,
by instilling the tenets of information literacy knowledge and skills in their professional
preparation, librarians can empower future nurses to practice evidence based nursing.
The research into the information literacy of the Campus nursing students was
finalized as a convergent parallel designed mixed methods assessment of the LIB 101
prerequisite on the information literacy levels of the those students beginning the nursing
program. The project assessed the basic information literacy levels of two groups of
students in NUR 101—one enrolled in NUR 101 prior to the establishment of the LIB
101 pre-requisite (NOLIB) and the second enrolled in NUR 101 after completing the prerequisite of LIB 101 (LIB). I determined such basic information literacy levels before
and after the implementation of the LIB 101 pre-requisite via individual student
knowledge-based assessments administered to both groups, as well as by holding student
interviews and/or focus groups with a representative sample from both groups. Both the
quantitative and the qualitative portions were developed, executed, and evaluated with
the definitions and concepts described in Chapters 1 (Introduction) and 2 (Literature
Review).

65
Quantitative Investigation
Knowledge-based assessment. Assessment ideas traditionally linked to
information literacy such as document review of student bibliographies (Hinchliffe,
Kubiak & Hunt, 2003) were considered. I was involved with the project with the College
as part of a General Education assessment in 2008 which included an assessment of
anonymized English Composition assignments regarding the number of sources used and
the frequency of attribution. However, in consultation with the Campus nursing
department and the dissertation advisor, an assignment assessment was rejected as the
research for the first semester of nursing is based upon solely one primary case
study/research article. Instead, a knowledge-based assessment of their information
seeking and use (Appendix C) was developed and administered to the students enrolled in
NUR 101 at the College. As discussed in Chapter Two, the knowledge assessment was
developed after researching several such assessments, including the JMU Information
Literacy Test, Project SAILS, and ETS iSkills.
Question format and presentation depended greatly upon the results from a
previous assessment developed and administered during a sabbatical project to determine
if there were any significant differences between the information use and behavior of
community college students in a developmental freshman orientation course and in the
sophomore level capstone course for the Associate in Arts degree (General Transfer
Studies). For example, all knowledge-based questions included an answer choice of "I do
not know." The “I do not know” option permitted a more accurate measurement of what

66
students did know or did not know than would have been possible by students “best
guessing.”
At least one outcome from each ACRL standard, excluding Standard 4, were
addressed in the research protocol, which helped to corroborate and to justify the protocol
decisions that had been finalized prior to the publication of the Nursing Standards,
(available in full in Appendix B). Standard 4, “The information literate nurse,
individually or as a member of a group, uses information effectively to accomplish a
purpose” (ACRL, 2013) was not reflected in the research protocol in regards to the
suggested outcomes. Questions relating to some of the outcomes, such as Standard Five
Performance Indicator Three, bullet a: “Correctly cites references in required format
(APA, MLA) for all works used in a project” (ACRL, 2013), were considered too
specific, rigid, or formal for the research and were rejected during the project
development. It should also be remembered that the Nursing Standards addressed
desired information literacy among practicing nurses and doctoral level nurses as well as
those pursuing two year registered nursing programs. Many of the outcomes, such as
Standard 4.Performance Indicator 1.f, “Initiates changes in performance of patient care
when information or evidence warrants evaluation of other options for improving
outcomes or decreasing adverse events” (ACRL, 2013) would be inappropriate for
assessing the information literacy of pre-nursing students as they would not yet have had
any such experience.
Measures/Variables. The questions were limited, but addressed library resources
(both print and online), freely available online resources, documentation, search

67
strategies, and information evaluation. The questions were structured to mitigate bias and
carefully constructed to not include library jargon. The assessment also asked for basic
demographic information. The development and choice of the assessment questions
were based upon knowledge points determined from review of the information literacy
and nursing literature as previously discussed, feedback from Campus nursing and library
faculty, and the learning outcomes from the LIB 101 course profile. The nursing faculty
stressed the need for nursing students to be able to find scholarly research for their case
studies—a skill that they found particularly lacking in the nursing students.
The 17 question survey (Appendix C) included two demographic questions, two
questions about resource preference, nine information literacy assessment multiple choice
questions (each including only one correct answer as well as a “I do not know” option),
three questions about library exposure, and one question about completion of LIB 101.
Each student’s correct answers on the nine information literacy assessment questions
were summed to provide the continuous variable of the information literacy score. Three
additional questions regarding library research assistance, library database use, and
previous other library instruction session attendance were also asked. The responses to
these were combined to provide a continuous variable of library exposure/experience.
The 17 questions were set up in the following manner:
1. Permission
2. Demographic/Age
3, 4. Sources Used
5-13. Knowledge-based Assessment

68
14-17. Library Exposure
The first two questions, having to do with permission and age, were not relevant to the
hypotheses and are discussed below. Questions 3-17 will be fully addressed in Chapter
Four: Findings.
Permission. The first question provided the overview of the study and a Yes or
No question to proceed and to grant permission to use the results as part of the research
project. The LibGuide software allowed certain questions to require answers. Question
number 1 had to be answered by yes to allow continuation of the assessment. Only one
student answered in the negative. That student was not asked further questions, and that
submission was removed from the total responses.
Age/Demographic. While future studies may want to examine information
literacy in regard to age, race/ethnicity, and/or other demographic lenses, this study was
primarily interested in ensuring that student responders were all adults. All responses
indicated an age of 18 years or older.
Assessment Tool. How would the questions then be administered? Several
options were explored regarding the assessment tool. I had previously relied upon a
paper assessment for the sabbatical project. However, the student population for that
study included developmental reading students, and an online assessment tool had been
thought to possibly skew the results due to various computer/college/test anxieties. As
the nursing students in NUR 101 have been in college for at least two years and have
been using Blackboard and other course management systems during that time, online
tools were considered appropriate. Additionally, the anonymity (no possibility of

69
identifying a student by a certain ink color, etc.) as well as the aggregating, exporting,
and analysis advantages of online tools helped in the decision making.
StudentVoice is the assessment software officially used by the College. Use of
the product is restricted to the college district Office of Institutional Research, Planning,
and Assessment staff. I approached the office with the proposed research; unfortunately,
the office was unable to provide the assessment tool due to unspecified constraints.
Blackboard’s testing and surveying instruments were then considered; however,
certain aspects of the CMS’s tools seemed inappropriate for this investigation. For
example, the participants would need to be enrolled in a Blackboard course (whether
credit-bearing or a special shell created for the research) to access and complete the
assessment. Administering the assessment in the NUR 101 Blackboard course would be
inappropriate as the nursing faculty would be able to retrieve aggregated responses and
would also be able to see who had (or had not) participated. Creating a Blackboard
course for the express purpose of the assessment was also deemed inappropriate as a
number of college district employees, including library administration and Blackboard
coordinators, would then have access to similar information sets: the names of all the
students, regardless as to whether they voluntarily participated or not, as well as the
information about whether or not they participated and their assessment results.
Open access survey software, such as SurveyMonkey and PollCat, were also
considered; however, the College frowns on assessment administered with non-sponsored
tools beyond basic classroom assessments (CATs). Ultimately, the survey/assessment
tool embedded in the LibGuide software to which the college libraries subscribe

70
(Springshare, 2013) was used. The LibGuide product provided for anonymity as well as
for aggregating the responses and formatting them easily to be exported into Excel and
into SPSS for analysis. Another positive aspect of this tool was that it could be
temporarily embedded in the Nursing LibGuide each semester—for only the day of
assessment administration. This allowed students to quickly access the assessment link
through the LibGuide at the time of assessment, but then prevented them (or future
nursing students) to access the assessment and possibly share questions with sample
groups. As a final positive aspect, the nursing students were introduced to the Nursing
LibGuide which provided knowledge of a resource which could be perused after
completing the assessment or during the assessment should they have chosen not to
participate. Appendix C provides the full survey as it appeared in the LibGuide software.
Participants.
Samples. A convenient, voluntary sample method was utilized. Community
college students admitted to the two-year Associate in Applied Science Nursing Program
and enrolled in NUR 101, Fundamentals of Nursing at one of the college campuses were
targeted. Each semester, a cohort of students is admitted to one section of the sevencredit-hour introductory nursing program course offered at the Campus of the College. It
was anticipated that the assessment would be administered in the Fall and Spring of
academic year 2013-14 to approximately forty students without the LIB 101 prerequisite
in Fall of 2013 and by another forty students who would have completed the prerequisite
in Spring 2014. However, because there is a two year waiting list for the nursing program
at the Campus, both the Fall 2013 and the Spring 2014 sections were for the most part

71
populated by students who were “grandfathered” and admitted to the program without the
prerequisite. Thus, the research period was extended—the assessment was administered
to an additional two cohorts of students in NUR 101 (Fall 2014 and Spring 2015).
Although the knowledge-based assessment was administered to 153 students total, the
grandfathering of students College-wide continued during academic year 2014-15 which
resulted in the NOLIB group including 124 students and the LIB group only 29. There
was no discrete cohort of NOLIB students as opposed to LIB students: the NUR 101
cohorts each semester (except for Fall, 2013) were composed of both NOLIB and LIB
students. The total numbers of NOLIB and LIB students participating each semester
were graphed for visual comparison in Figure 1.

Recruitment. The Nursing Department at the Campus supported the research and
provided time for the administering of the survey prior to the “Library Research”
component of the nursing program orientation during the first day of class. I
accompanied the Nursing liaison librarian to the one-shot library instruction session after
the students received their Blackboard online course instruction session in a classroom

72
with a computer lab. Before the Nursing librarian provided the library instruction
session, I introduced the voluntary study and invited the students to participate. There
were no external incentives for students to participate in the survey; however, the Nursing
faculty interrupted me during the introduction of the assessment to encourage students to
participate to help improve the Nursing Program. The Nursing faculty then left to allow
the students the choice of whether or not to participate with no pressure from their course
instructors. In addition to the consent question preceding the survey questions in the
online form, all students received a copy of the consent form (Appendix D) to keep.
Students also received a separate invitation (Appendix E) to participate in qualitative
focus group research. Those who were interested could complete the bottom half of the
form with a first name and a contact method—email address and/or phone number.
Students were requested to return the form by placing them in a stack at the back of the
room after completion of the survey—regardless if it was filled out or not. Students were
then shown how to access the online survey via a temporarily available link in the
Nursing Course LibGuide for completion. Students were provided approximately 25
minutes to complete the survey. All who participated were able to complete the survey in
the time allowed.
Procedure. The questions were presented in the same order for all participants,
all four semesters of the study during the first class meeting/orientation session for each
NUR 101 section, except for the final administration when the nursing faculty requested a
later date:
2013, August 27, 9:00 am

73
2014, January 21, 11:00 am
2014, August 17, 9:30 am
2015, February 2, 2:00 pm
When administering the survey, I first read a description of the survey and the consent
form to the class. The same information was provided as the first question of the online
survey. I then distributed consent forms and demonstrated the path from the Nursing
LibGuide to the temporary survey link, again stressing the voluntary nature of
participation. Directions, including the encouragement to answer “I do not know” rather
than to guess, were then read. I stressed several times that the study was voluntary: that
students were not required to participate, that the Nursing faculty would not be privy to
either their answers or even their participation, and that students did not have to answer
all questions. The students were then provided twenty-five minutes to complete the
survey. All participants completed the survey within the allotted time. There was only
one survey period for each class, and the testing period took place at the classes’
regularly scheduled meeting time.
Data analysis. The responses to the knowledge assessment submitted to the
LibGuide were saved in spreadsheet form. The output was then uploaded to SPSS for
analysis. The quantitative analysis will be described in Chapter Four: Findings.
Qualitative Investigation
Semi-structured interviews and/or focus groups. Tyron, Frigo, & O’Kelly
assessed faculty competencies via observations within focus groups (2010). While the
research project was not going to focus on faculty viewpoints, I gained insight and ideas

74
as to the development of the nursing student focus group protocol. Additionally,
observations of information literacy instructional sessions (Helbling, K., conference
presentation, “Authentic Assessment: Evaluating the Growth of Student Research Skills,”
Missouri Library Association Annual Conference, Oct. 6, 2011; Swoger, 2011), although
based on observations in “one-shot” session classes, suggested ways in which observation
of a task might be used within an interview or focus group situation. Ultimately,
observation was not included in the protocol as the use of the library—even the library
website—was thought to possibly influence students in their information seeking.
Instead, the focus groups/interviews were structured around open ended questions
designed to facilitate comparison, but which would still allow for the exploration of
emergent issues. Semi-structured individual interviews or small focus groups were
conducted, dependent upon the schedules and preferences of the volunteer sample. The
semi-structured format allowed for the clarification of both questions and answers. The
interviews/focus groups were designed to last approximately 30 minutes and included
reference to questions from the knowledge-based assessment as well as open-ended
questions about information experiences, needs, and sources (Appendix H).
Sample. A convenient, voluntary sample method was utilized for the qualitative
portion, as well as the quantitative. A voluntary sample consisting of 12-16 students was
sought in the proposed one year term and 24-32 students with the second year extension;
however, participation ended up being much less. In the best case scenario, half of the
participants would be from among the students in NUR 101 before the pre-requisite and
half from among the students after the institution of the pre-requisite. Although a sample

75
of approximately 40 students was sought, only 16 participated. Eight interviews/focus
groups were held as scheduled to the preferences of the participants:
2013, November 22, 11:00 am (4 participants)
2014, March 5, 11:00 am (1 participant)
2014, March 7, 11:00 am (3 participants)
2014, September 22, 12:00 pm (2 participants)
2014, October 3, 11:00 am (1 participant)
2015, February 20, 12:15 pm (1 participant)
2015, February 23, 3:15 pm (1 participant)
2015, March 2, 12:00 pm (3 participants)
Recruitment. The consent form for the knowledge-based assessment included an
additional sheet with a statement about the interviews/focus groups and requested contact
information for any student who considered participating. Before the knowledge-based
assessment was administered, the focus group/interview opportunity was discussed and
students were invited to participate. Gift cards in $25 and $100 amounts were offered as
incentives. I personally provided $25 gift cards to each interview/focus group participant
with an additional $100 gift card to be awarded to a randomly drawn name from among
the interview/focus group participants at the conclusion of the study. To ensure that no
student felt compelled to participate, in both cases, the nursing faculty did not receive any
responses—I collected the paper responses together with the consent forms for the
assessment. The electronic responses were directly sent to me via the LibGuide
(Appendix E). Additionally, the NUR 101 instructors agreed to electronically distribute

76
the same request at least twice during each semester requesting that interested students
contact me by email or by telephone.
Data analysis. Both inductive and deductive processes were utilized in the data
analysis.
Inductive Analysis Process. The inductive process began with the transcription
of each interview. Each transcription was then reviewed and salient points were coded
with keywords. I also made use of memos and bracketing to add impressions, in an
attempt to identify possible patterns as they emerged, etc., and these notes were also
including in the coding as recommended by Cresswell (2008, 193-4). While beginning
with some basic questions as outlined in the protocol, I had hoped to follow a modified
form of grounded theory and had planned to reanalyze previous data, pursue
disconfirming data, expand the sample, and modify questions and the data collection as
the research continued. However, as participation was lacking, this was difficult. Of the
eleven interviews were scheduled, only eight took place—with sixteen total participants.
Merely three of whom had completed LIB 101. Thus, the inductive process was
restricted to an analysis of the eight transcripts for emergent themes. The transcriptions
were read multiple times and, as Cresswell outlined (2008, 198-199), I developed
coding—identifying terms or phrases. Sometimes the code notation was a noun, for
example, “database” or “scholarly source”; other times, the code was an adjective, such
as “overwhelming” or “frustrated.” Coding also referred to student actions or beliefs,
including “reliance on google” and to experiences such as “Comp 2” and “exposure,” the
last two indicating that a student had referred to a previous one-shot session or use of the

77
library within the confines of a non-nursing course assignment. These codes were then
compiled and compared, resulting in emergent themes which were reviewed in
association with the hypotheses.
Deductive Analysis Process. Following Creswell’s description of “traditional”
coding (2008, 199), I returned to the transcripts after completing the inductive analysis to
review them in light of the themes to ascertain if there were additional examples that had
been missed. While few additional examples were realized from the deductive process, it
was still fruitful and helped me to solidify the addressing of the emergent themes. As
only three of the interviewees had completed LIB 101, I was able to separate thoughts
from those who had completed LIB 101 (L) from those who had not completed LIB 101
(NL).
Summary
The literature review as compiled in Chapter Two led to the development of the
conceptual question: How does the completion of a one-credit hour information literacy
course affect the information behavior and the information literacy skills of samples of
students in an introductory nursing course? The conceptual question led to the
development of an overarching research question: Specifically, how does a sample of
Fundamentals of Nursing (NUR 101) students who have had no prior formal information
literacy instruction locate, access, and use information compared to a sample of NUR 101
students who have completed the one credit hour Introduction to College and Online
Literacy (LIB 101)? This, in turn, led to four specific questions to be addressed:

78
1. What resources do students in the samples tend to rely on for research, and
why do they rely upon them?
2. How do students in the samples tend to evaluate and to verify —to determine
credibility and reliability—of information resources?
3. Do students in the samples understand the idea of scholarly research published
in peer reviewed resources? Can they recognize it and do they know how to
find it?
4. How do nursing students in their first program semester search for health
and/or other information? Do they understand basic keyword search
techniques?
A mixed-methods investigation was developed to address the research questions
regarding the basic information literacy levels of students in NUR 101. The investigation
assessed two groups—one enrolled in NUR 101 prior to the establishment of the LIB 101
prerequisite (NOLIB) and the second enrolled in NUR 101 after completing the
prerequisite of LIB 101 (LIB). The research was undertaken to determine such basic
information literacy levels before and after the implementation of the LIB 101
prerequisite via individual student knowledge-based assessments administered to both
groups, as well as by holding student interviews and/or focus groups with a representative
sample from both groups. The findings from the research will be discussed in Chapter
Four: Findings.

79
Chapter Four:
Findings
The findings from both the quantitative and the qualitative portions of the
research are detailed in this chapter, beginning with a look at the individual questions
from the assessment. Each question is addressed and examined via the Chi-square test
for association. Then, the overall correct responses are compared to the incorrect or “I
don’t know” responses to the knowledge-based assessment. SPSS analyses of the
knowledge-based assessment follow, including a Chi-square test to see if any relationship
exists between the number of correct answers on the assessment and completion of the
library course as well as a Point-Biserial correlation and a multiple regression analysis to
test if either completion of the library course or library exposure (based upon library and
library resource use) could help to explain the assessment scores. The chapter concludes
with the findings from the qualitative portion of the research and outlines eleven themes
that emerged from the interviews/focus groups.
Responses to the individual questions on the knowledge-based assessment were
problematic—small numbers invalidated some results. Additionally, significant
relationships between the individual question correct responses and completion of the
library course were not regularly found. However, significant relationships were found
among the students’ total information literacy scores, the completion of the library
course, and exposure to the library. These findings were supported by the emergent
themes from the qualitative research.

80
Quantitative Results
Following is a breakdown of the knowledge-based questions and answers. The
survey included nine information literacy assessment multiple choice questions (each
including only one correct answer as well as an “I do not know” option) to assess
information literacy knowledge. Percentages were used rather than total numbers as the
total numbers were disproportionate—the total number of the participants who had
completed LIB 101 (29) was approximately one-quarter (23%) of the total number of
participants (124).
Individual Information Literacy Questions and Responses.
Sources Used. Questions 3 and 4 attempted to capture what sources students
most commonly used to BEGIN (Question 3) and to rely upon MOST (Question 4) for
completing course assignments. Chi-square analysis of the sources used by those who
had not completed LIB 101 to those who had were attempted; unfortunately, 11 cells in
the Chi-square analysis of Question 3 (Figure 2) and 12 cells in that of Question 4 (Figure
3) had expected count of less than 5 which invalidated the results.

Figure 3. Invalidation of Chi-Square Test for Question 4.

As no determination could be made regarding any significant difference among the
sources relied upon by the NOLIB and LIB students, the response frequencies for the two
questions were then examined to see what students reported using, as outlined in Table 1.

82
In retrospect, the question was flawed as students in the interviews/focus groups
expressed confusion as to the difference between the magazines/journals and the library
databases options, and others did not know what was meant by search engines and/or by
reference books.
Knowledge-based Assessment.
Frequencies. An excel-based worksheet of the frequencies of responses charted
for each of the nine Information Literacy Questions (Survey Questions 5-13) are included
in Appendix F. Appendix F includes percentage totals of each answer choice for the full
sample, for those who did not complete LIB 101, and for those who had completed LIB
101.
Quantitative Analysis. Chi-square tests for association were completed on each
question, comparing all of the answers submitted by the students who had completed LIB
101 with those students who had not completed the course. Small numbers in certain
cells within the SPSS analysis invalidated the results for the questions as shown from the
output in Figure 4:

Figure 4. Invalidation of Chi-Square Test for Question 5-13.
.

83
The variables were transformed for each question to reflect either a correct response or an
incorrect response, including the “I don’t know” option (as opposed to either a correct or
several incorrect responses); then, the Chi-square test for association using a p value of
0.05 was re-run to see if a relationship existed between completion of LIB 101
(COMPLETION) and if each question had been correctly answered or not. A table of
Chi-square results for Questions 5-13 (Table 2) follows the narrative section.
Question 5. Which of the following is the best way to verify the accuracy and
credibility of articles or other research found on the Web? A statistically significant
relationship between correctly answering Question 5 and Completion was not found: X2
(1, N = 153) = 0.061, p = .805. The evidence suggested that students who complete LIB
101 do not significantly better know how to evaluate and how to verify the accuracy and
credibility of articles or other research found on the Web than do students who did not
complete LIB 101.
Question 6. If you found some great articles from a Google search, but the web
sites require payment to fully access the articles, what should you do? A statistically
significant relationship between correctly answering Question 6 and Completion was not
found: X2 (1, N = 153) = 1.469, p = .226. The evidence suggested that students who
complete LIB 101 do not significantly know better to check with their academic
library/with a librarian when confronted by a for-pay article than do students who did not
complete LIB 101.
Question 7. When should you cite your sources? A statistically significant
relationship between correctly answering Question 7 and Completion was not found: X2

84
(1, N = 153) = .671, p = .413. The evidence suggested that students who complete LIB
101 do not significantly better know when to cite sources than students who did not
complete LIB 101.
Question 8. Which of the following is not necessarily a characteristic of a
scholarly article? A statistically significant relationship between correctly answering
Question 8 and Completion was found: X2 (1, N = 153) = 4.495, p = .034. The evidence
suggested that students who complete LIB 101 do significantly better understand the
characteristics that differentiate scholarly articles from other types of articles than
students who did not complete LIB 101.
Question 9. What is the most important aspect of a scholarly article that
differentiates it from a popular resource? A statistically significant relationship between
correctly answering Question 9 and Completion was not found: X2 (1, N = 153) = 3.595,
p = .058. The evidence suggested that students who complete LIB 101 do not
significantly better understand the importance of peer review as a major difference
between scholarly and popular resources than do students who did not complete LIB 101.
Question 10. What is an academic journal? A statistically significant relationship
between correctly answering Question 10 and Completion was not found: X2 (1, N = 153)
= .105, p = .746. The evidence suggested that students who complete LIB 101 cannot
significantly better identify the definition of an academic journal than can students who
did not complete LIB 101.
Question 11. Which of the following resources from EBSCOhost would be the
preferred resource to find a nursing scholarly research article? A statistically significant

85
relationship between correctly answering Question 11 and Completion was not found: X2
(1, N = 153) = 2.768, p = .096. The evidence suggested that students who complete LIB
101 cannot significantly better identify a nursing database from interdisciplinary
databases than can students who did not complete LIB 101.
Question 12. To find information about the "management of asthma in children"
in most library resources, the best search function to use is the _____? A statistically
significant relationship between correctly answering Question 12 and Completion was
not found: X2 (1, N = 153) = 1.106, p = .293. The evidence suggested that students who
complete LIB 101 cannot significantly better identify the need to begin with a keyword
search for a complex search than can students who did not complete LIB 101.
Question 13. Which of the following searches would be the most effective way to
search for the "management of asthma in children" in most library resources? A
statistically significant relationship between correctly answering Question 13 and
Completion was found: X2 (1, N = 153) = 5.070, p = .024. The evidence suggested that
students who complete LIB 101 can significantly better identify a correctly developed
nested Boolean search than can students who did not complete LIB 101.
Only 2 of the 9 knowledge-based questions (Questions 8 and 13) showed a
significant relationship between the correct response and the completion of LIB 101.
Why this might be the case will be discussed later in Chapter Five regarding the
hypotheses.

Overall Correct Answers. After analyzing each individual question, the overall
performance on the knowledge-based assessment was investigated. Total numbers were
transformed to percentages as the total numbers were disproportionate--the total number
of the participants who had completed LIB 101 (29) was only approximately one-fifth
(19%) of the total number of 153 participants (124). Graphing percentages of students
with the number of correct answers resulted in a normal distribution with a slight skewing
towards the right (Figure 5).

87

Figure 5. Number of correct responses by percentage of students, all
participants.

More students placed in the left (lower scoring) side of the bell curve for the nine
Information Literacy questions. This was not thought to be unexpected as only 19% of
the assessed students identified as having completed LIB 101.
The percentages were then examined in regards to the two courses. The following
graph, Figure 6, shows the percentage of students who had answered that number of
questions correctly on the assessment. Those counts and the resulting bell curves
suggested that students who had completed LIB 101 improved via a higher total
knowledge-based assessment score versus those students who had not completed
LIB 101.

88

Quantitative Analyses.
Chi-Square. A Chi-square test for association was performed to see if a
relationship existed between the number of correct answers to the knowledge-based
assessment (Correct) and the completion of LIB 101 (Completion). Unfortunately, nine
cells (50%) had an expected count of less than 5; invalidating the results. The ten
category variable Correct was transformed into a four category Correct2 variable with
correct answer ranges of 0-1 (1), 2-4 (2), 5-6 (3), and 7-9 (4). The Chi-square test for
association was repeated with the Correct2 variable in place of the Correct variable, and a
statistically significant relationship between Correct2 and Completion was found: X2 (3,
N = 153) = 19.03, p = .00. The statistically significant relationship between Correct2 and
Completion suggested that students who complete LIB 101 performed significantly better
than the students who did not complete LIB 101.

89
Point-Biserial Correlation. Question numbers 14 (had the student ever asked for
research assistance at a college/university library), 15 (had the student used a library
database) and 16 (had the student attended a library instruction session), were combined
to form a continuous variable of LIBRARY (library exposure) to see if library exposure
or information literacy instruction outside of LIB 101 affected the nursing student’s
information literacy levels. As there would then be a continuous variable compared to a
dichotomous variable, a Point-Biserial correlation was used to determine how well
completion of the library course (COURSE) and library exposure (the combined three
questions) (LIBRARY), correlate to and help to explain students’ information literacy
scores (CORRECT). Per the Point-Biserial correlations as laid out in Table 3, significant
relationships exist between the dependent variable and each of the independent
variables. A low, significant, and positive relationship exists between the completion of
the course and the information literacy score, rpb = .26, p = .01, which indicates that
students who completed the library course tended to have higher information literacy
scores on the knowledge-based assessment than students who had not. A low,
significant, and positive relationship exists between library exposure and the information
literacy score, rpb = .23, p = .01, which indicates that students with more forms of library
exposure tend to have higher information literacy scores than those who have fewer
forms of library exposure from visiting the library, using the library databases, or having
a librarian visit a previous class.

The results of the Point-Biserial Correlation suggested that library exposure may
positively affect correct responses on the knowledge-based assessment as well as the
course. Unfortunately, as there was overlap of LIB 101 completion and library exposure
among the students, a more specific conclusion could not be drawn from the PointBiserial correlation. Thus, regression analysis was then used as well to analyze the data.

Multiple Regression Analysis was utilized to determine how library exposure
(LIBRARY), as previously defined, and completion of the LIB 101 course (LIB 101)
would help to explain students’ information literacy scores (CORRECT). While the n of
153 may be considered low for multiple regression analysis, VanVoorhis & Morgan

91
(2007) referenced Green’s 1991 study into how many cases multiple regression analyses
requires, as well as Harris’ 1985 formula for determining the “absolute minimum number
of participants,” to provide a “general rule of thumb… [of] no less than 50 participants
for a correlation or regression with the number increasing with larger numbers of
independent variables (IVs) (48).”

The analysis (Table 4) indicated that the model including the independent
variables together accounted for approximately 9% of the variance in information literacy
scores (R2 = .09; R2adj = .08), F(3, 150) = 7.71, p = .001. Library exposure (LIBRARY)
was a significant predictor of the information literacy score, t(150) = 2.52, p < .05; as was
the library course (COURSE), t(150) = 2.12, p < .05. Holding the library course constant,
as students were exposed to the library and its resources, the information literacy score
was estimated to increase by 0.52 points (95% CI: 0.07, 0.59). Holding exposure to the
library and library resources constant, completion of the library course affected the
information literacy score by an estimated increase of 1.45 points (95% CI: 0.05, 1.50).

Using a tolerance cut-off level of 0.20 and a VIF cut-off of level 4, the
Collinearity Statistics indicate no issue with multi-collinearity among the variables. An
outlier diagnostic was also conducted using a Leverage cut-off value of .099, which
returned no outliers.

Qualitative Results.
Both inductive and deductive processes were utilized in the data analysis
following Cresswell’s (2008) model of coding for grounded research. Recordings of
each interview/focus group were transcribed with additions in brackets of points from the
field notes taken by hand during the proceedings. Each transcription was then reviewed
and coded with keywords at least four times. The codes were then compiled and
compared, resulting in emergent themes which were reviewed in association with the
hypotheses. After completing the inductive analysis, the transcripts were again reviewed
in light of the identified themes to ascertain if there were additional examples that had
been missed. As only three of the interviewees had completed LIB 101, I also was able
to separate thoughts from those who had completed LIB 101 (L) and from those who had
not completed LIB 101 (NL).

93
Emergent themes. The resultant emergent themes are merely outlined below.
They will be discussed in relation to the hypotheses in the Chapter Five. Bullet points are
used when the statements were not from particular transcripts and in no specific order
while P1/P2 and Researcher are used to identify ordered statements that occurred in an
exchange/conversation.
Emergent Theme 1: The dependence on search engines, especially from “my
phone” for information. Students, even those who had completed LIB 101, expressed a
great dependence on Google for information seeking and often referred to convenience:
● I used to use Yahoo; I use Google now (NL).
● I always use Google….I really think that knowledge is all at the fingertips
now (NL).
● I Bing it…It’s on my phone (NL).
● Well, generally…my phone (NL).
● First thing I do is Google (NL).
● Usually, first thing I do is Google [laughs] (L).
● I’ll Google what I need, and then I will look at different sources (L).
Emergent Theme 2: Disappointment that sought information is not found.
Although the students continued to depend upon Google for information, including that
for nursing information, they felt defeated because the information sought was not always
found or prohibitively expensive to access when found via an open search engine.
● Sometimes, ‘cause when you’re typing in certain things that you’re looking
for and they’re specific, it doesn’t find it for you (NL).

94
● I do Google it, but then I look to see if it’s from like Nursing Journal or
whatever, and a lot of them do seem to ask for pay…so I just move on. I’ve
never paid for anything on there, a lot of times, you don’t know who you’re
dealing with and can’t trust them (NL).
Emergent Theme 3: Frustration with information found via Google that may
be unreliable or biased. Although the students continued to depend upon Google for
information, including that for nursing information, they were also frustrated by the
information that they identified as suspect.
● Some of that information’s not real reliable (NL).
● I use Google…but, you know, most of the time the sites that you get—they
are not the most, not correct, not right (NL).
● I always Google, then I have to look at the websites that pop up because of
course some of those are not reliable (NL).
● When you get to it, you find that you don’t get the right information that you
are looking for…waste a lot of time (NL).
● Sometimes if you…just try to get quick information and you’re looking for
something and then you think, ‘That’s not right!’ and you know that it’s not
accurate but just to get something quick, but you’re still like, “Hey, that’s not
right (NL).
Students also referred to the problem of finding biased information and that much of the
information that they come across—whether via searching or having it come to them,
such as on Facebook—is slanted.

95
●

[Discussing finding sources on vaccination] Oh, yeah, it’s like one extreme
or the other…it’s like you’re stupid and I’m not going to listen to what you
say. It’s hard to come together (NL).

● Like on Facebook, some people are way this side, some people are way that
side and very few people are like hey let’s come together and discuss this
(NL).
Emergent Theme 4: Reliance on textbooks, especially nursing textbooks.
Students rely on their nursing textbooks because they have been instructed to do so by the
nursing faculty and because of the disappointing and frustrating results that they have
encountered on the open web.
● I use my [nursing] book to find out what websites to trust (NL).
● I always have like a text book source to go with it (NL)
● Going out we actually have a book, MedServe textbook that we had to buy,
so we’re supposed to go to that first. Sometimes I’ll look for general, like I’ll
google something, like I’ll google a disease and then all these websites pop
up and then I’ll just jot down some information but then I’ll always go back
to my text (NL).
Even those who had completed LIB 101 expressed an initial reliance on the nursing
textbook: “I’d say we [nursing students] use the textbook for most information” (L).
The use of textbooks had also been reinforced across the curriculum. An NL
student who had substituted College Composition II for the LIB 101 requirement
explained that her research “information came from the [text] book that we were

96
reading.” She further discussed that instead of requiring individual research, the
instructor “would give us something to read and then some questions to answer” (NL).
The interview accounts suggested that the nursing students relied heavily on their
textbooks—a reliance that does not allow for learning from updated information.
Emergent Theme 5: Reliance on peers and others within circles who may not
be good sources. Supporting Chatman’s Small Worlds and Information Poverty models,
students, upon experiencing problems finding the information, reported asking peers and
others with whom they’ve had contact for help—even if better informed individuals were
known and/or accessible.
● I asked another student to help me, that was my first problem. [Laughs.] I
should have asked the [Nursing] teacher (NL).
● If I can’t find it on the internet, then I’ll go to a person. I try to find it on the
internet, but if it looks like these not enough information, then I’ll go find
someone to ask (NL).
● [Exchange]
P1: I was looking for the dosage calculations test book; it was very difficult
to find (NL).
Researcher: Were you using the library catalog?
P1: No, just the website…the website search box (NL).
Researcher: Do you mean the search box on the libraries page?
P1: No, they just told us to search the college website (NL).

97
Researcher: You mean that you were searching the main college website?
Like the search box on [the college website]?
P1: Yeah, the search box at the top (NL).
Researcher: They, the nursing faculty told you to search that way?
P1: No you have to take the test before you are actually in the nursing
program; that’s what the academic advisor told me to do (NL).
Emergent Theme 6: Fears that information and the profession are changing
too quickly to keep up and that nurses (and nursing students) feel as though they don’t
have the time or the resources to do so. Students are “overwhelmed” and “scared” by the
amount of information of which they need to be aware and the rate at which information
is changed or updated in the nursing profession.
● As far as other resources, as far as being current and being in the right for
procedures and everything, I don’t really know where I would go to
yet…what’s so scary about it is it’s got to be [current and accurate] because
everything changes so fast in science and medicine and there’s nothing that
you’re ever going to know 100%. It’s like they’re finding new stuff every day
(NL).
● It makes it so hard ‘cause…what they’re teaching us now is going to be
different in six months probably (NL).
● We have so many new rules and the guidelines for each hospital is different,
each floor is different, so, like no matter how, so like trying to find research
would be, you would think that would be an easy thing with the internet and

98
everything, but then you think of all the other things that you have to deal with
and you just, ugh (NL).
● There are so many; I never know where to go…I never know where do I start
(NL).
● I don’t know what I’m looking for. It’s overwhelming (NL).
● I opened [the databases] page up and I’m like, God, I don’t know (NL).
● I’m scared of the library as a whole, it just seems overwhelming to me, it’s
like walking into a bookstore, it’s so embarrassing (NL).
Students also referred to computer and access issues in regards to keeping up to date and
worried about not only remaining current with the professional standards, etc., but also
with the hardware and software and the connections required.
● Most hospitals have gone to paperless charting and because the nurses are
responsible for educating patients on meds and things like that, definitely the
knowledge on how to use the internet correctly and how to find what you’re
looking for, and you know, basic computer skills and working knowledge of
different hospital programs and basic computer lingo. I guess like, I don’t
know what like 2 gigabytes means, like, I think, I just need to know how
much stuff I can I save, just basic ways to maneuver around a computer and
know how to save things and print things out…it’s kinda like when I made fun
of my parents for not knowing how to use the VCR…and now my nieces and
nephews come over and they’re like making I-movies and I’m like, what? I
have no idea what you’re doing (L).

99
● Every semester I’ve learned something new about the computer that, I mean,
even with the laptop that I just got, I’m like, oh, I didn’t know that I could do
this (L)!
● [About working at a rural hospital] and there’s probably no Starbucks or
places like that, that we have wifi now, and even there unless you have a
smartphone or your own laptop, you know, to access that, because, you know
there’re not any computers for people to use. Like you can’t walk into Bread
Company and sit down at a computer and even if you do have a computer,
they don’t offer, like printing services…or assistance. No one at Bread Co. is
going to help you (L).
Emergent Theme 7: Practicing health care professionals confirm the use of
Google. Students shared that the professionals that they shadow use Google as a basis for
patient care.
● When I was doing my clinicals at [local hospital], I googled, I can’t
remember what this lady had, but I googled it because my nurse, my
clinician, she was like, ‘I don’t even know what that is, I never heard of it,’
so I googled it (NL).
● [Exchange]
Researcher: Say you’re working in the hospital and you have a question…
would you be more likely to go back to your textbook or talk to a nurse?
P1: Nurses Google (NL).
P2: Yeah, they do, I watch them all the time (NL).

100
● Doctors do it [Google] (NL).
The students expressed the view that if Google is good enough for practicing nurses—
and even doctors—it should be adequate for their needs. Yet, as earlier reviewed, they
were unsatisfied with and leery of the results.
Emergent Theme 8: No clear understanding between an article database and a
library catalog, much less database collections and their vendors, leading towards a
desire for print resources with which they have a degree of certainty.

Although some

initially stated that they used article databases, as the conversations developed, it became
clear that they either did not know how or did not even know what article databases were.
When asked about finding information for research papers, one student began:
[exchange]
P1: I do go to the main library and search the databases (NL).
Researcher: Great…what databases do you use?
P1: Um, the main library…it just has that subject or title (NL)?
Researcher: Do you mean the library catalog where you find…
P1: Yeah, the library catalog (NL).
Researcher: So, you usually go to books?
P1: Yeah, I like books…I can actually see, hold them (NL).
Another student confessed, “I don’t know even if you guys still use the thing [motions
with hands]—card catalog” (NL).
Some students reported using periodical databases to research for other courses;
however, student experiences varied. Another student, after some questions, clarified

101
that her experience with databases was limited to the “hot topic” (NL) databases CQ
Researcher and Opposing Viewpoints. Identifying the database collection by the more
generic vendor provider was common, as yet another student stated: “I would go to
EBSCO first. I remember it from [English] class” (NL). An exchange among three
students, all who had not completed LIB 101, again provided evidence that there was
confusion about database collections as opposed to the database vendor:
P1: I like Ebso (NL).
P2: You mean Ebsco (NL)?
P1: Yeah, I went to that (NL).
P3: I used CINAHL (NL).
P2: It was the same thing (NL).
P3: Was it (NL)?
Note: These students were aware of EBSCOhost nursing databases at the time of the
interview because they had just completed their scholarly article assignment.
Unfortunately, they shared that they had struggled with the assignment and that two of
them had had to redo it with nursing faculty assistance because they had initially
completed the assignment with magazine articles.
Emergent Theme 9: Students want to be provided sources because they
understand the need for, but are poor at, critical evaluation of information. Some
realize the need to evaluate information and think that they can make good judgements
just by reading the information, the appearance of the source, and/or the domain:
● After I read through it, I can just tell (NL).

102
● By the look of the website, yeah, the look and what they have on there (NL).
● I use my [nursing] book to find out what websites to trust (NL).
● I tend to trust sites that have a dot org or a dot edu after them instead of a dot
com (NL).
● [Exchange]
P1: Don’t they say like not to trust dot coms (NL)?
P2: Yeah, dot orgs, I thought that we were supposed to use dot orgs (NL).
P1: Possibly, I don’t remember (NL).
P2: I don’t remember which one…(NL).
Because they realize that they are lacking in critical thinking skills, they want to be
provided with sources that they should and should not use:
● [Nursing faculty should provide] maybe the proper websites that they can go
to...to get reliable information (NL).
● …nursing students would have like a list of websites that are reliable (NL).
● I remember that at the beginning they said don’t use WebMD, so it would be
nice if we had a list [of what to use] (NL).
● I know the one that I know she told us not to go to, it was like Medweb?
Medweb.com (NL)?
Such desired lists are not limited to websites. The nurses also desired navigation to
certain nursing journals (such as the navigation of subject specific databases that is
included in the course objectives of the LIB 101 course):

103
● [if] we could only go through some specific journal articles, that would be
helpful (NL).
● It’d be easier if we had one or two options (L).
● I just pick one [database] and click on it because I don’t know the difference
(NL).
As Google was reinforced in the professional arena, so was the idea of presented
information as one student shared, “I guess ‘cause in the hospital, it’s like they have lists
of how to do each procedure, so we go to that a lot” (NL).
Emergent Theme 10: Students are intimidated by and are unprepared for the
scholarly article assignment. Due to the interviews varied by time in comparison to that
of the scholarly article assignment, Emergent Theme 10 represents only the views of the
control group. All three students who had completed LIB 101 were interviewed prior to
the assignment. The following responses are all from students who had not completed
LIB 101. Some interviews happened before the assignment, and the some students were
unfamiliar with the term:
[Exchange]
Researcher: Do you know what I mean by a scholarly article?
P1: No (NL).
P2: No, not really (NL).
Some had just been assigned the project and were lost:
● It’s kind of scary to me. I mean how do you know if it is research or not (NL)?
● I’m looking at this and I know that it’s due in 6 weeks and I’m going, where
do I start (NL)?

104
● [Exchange]
P1: Well, I would just go to the library site and use that Search It and then put
in the keyword that I was looking for (NL).
Researcher: What if you wanted to only find the scholarly articles?
P1: Oh, well, that’s like what we’ve been trying to figure out all week (NL).
Others, because of having worked through the scholarly article assignment or from varied
past experiences had some idea:
● There were keywords that we’re supposed to use, that the research is done, not
just…abstracts (NL).
● It would be more like a medicine based magazine versus like a regular…like
health fitness, like someone in the medical field wrote this (NL).
● I used to work in a med-school library, so I feel like I have the know-how to
search for the article through a journal because I used to have to do that kind
of stuff, but it is kind of scary when you’re, like is this actually what you’re
looking for, you know, and is it…right, like, definitely not Wikipedia (NL).
Others shared that they had incorrectly completed the project:
● I didn’t realize that you had to have a study (NL).
● I wasn’t sure what was meant by research (NL).
● I didn’t know if it was research that it had to say research and that it should
have results and all…my article was wrong, and I had to find another one
(NL).

105
●

[Exchange]
P1: I did my whole project wrong; it was; it wasn’t research, it didn’t have
the methods (NL).
P2: Mine too. I needed clinical trials and stuff (NL).

Emergent Theme 11: Completion of LIB 101 provided information seeking skills,
knowledge of various information collections, improved information behavior, and
confidence. The three interviewees who completed LIB 101 shared the following
statements that suggested the impact of having completed the information literacy course
on their ability to find the resources that they needed in their introductory nursing course:
● We looked at biased and unbiased resources and learned that it’s important to
know if something biased before we trust it (L).
● I would know to go to nursing journals to find unbiased information (L).
● [I know] how to type it in…the best keywords to use for scholarly articles (L).
● If I need to look up like insulin, then I can look up insulin and then maybe I need
to look at type 2 diabetes so I can narrow it from there. So I start broad just to
kind of see what pops up and then get more specific as I get the information (L).
● I feel like as a nursing student, having taken that 101 course, that I’m able to find
the information, and since everything is evidence based practice now, it will be
helpful when I need to a research project to cite that evidence based information
(L).
● When I took the capstone [for the general education degree, an option that some
nurses take along with the technical program], I had like this big research paper

106
and I got books through MOBIUS, so I guess that I do use books [as well as
databases] (L).
● Yeah, I know that this doesn’t’ sound modest, but yeah, I do feel like…I kind of
have a little bit of an edge over some students (L).
Summary
The findings from both the quantitative and the qualitative portions of the
research suggest that completion of the library class does affect the information literacy
of students in their first semester of nursing classes: students who complete LIB 101
prior to enrollment in NUR 101 significantly demonstrate better information literacy
behavior than the students who do not complete the information literacy course. While
small numbers in certain cells invalidated the Chi-square analysis of individual answers
to each knowledge-based assessment question, relationships do exist among the
completion of the library course, library exposure, and the students’ ability to correctly
answer basic questions about information literacy. Emergent themes from the interviews
and focus groups help support the results from quantitative data as well as the
frameworks and models used to design the study, such as Chatman’s Small Worlds and
Latham and Gross’ Confidence and Competency. The evidence provided by the project
in its entirety suggests that, yes; students who complete LIB 101 prior to enrollment in
NUR 101 significantly demonstrate better information literacy behavior than the students
who do not complete the information literacy course. Overall, the frequencies of the
assessment answers suggested that students, regardless of completion, relied most heavily
on open web sites, with some additional reliance on library databases and on textbooks.

107
Although students distrusted information found on the open web and were often
disappointed in their search results, that disappointment and untrustworthiness were not
considered serious enough compared to convenience for students to exclude them.
The evidence also indicated that students are aware of the need to critically
evaluate information—and that they are aware of their poor critical thinking skills.
Evidence also suggested that students who completed LIB 101, as opposed to those who
have not, can appropriately search with Boolean operators and locate, access, and use
scholarly literature. Chapter Five: Discussion of Results will further explore the findings
in relation to the initial hypotheses that were developed based upon such previous works.

108

Chapter Five:
Discussion of Results and Their Application to the Hypotheses
Chapter Four addressed the findings from both the quantitative and the qualitative
portions of the research. Interview and focus groups revealed relationships and
supporting themes between the library course and the correct responses to the knowledgebased assessment. Chapter Five, now, will apply the findings to the initial research
question: how do Fundamentals of Nursing (NUR 101) students who have had no prior
formal information literacy instruction locate, access, and use information compared to a
sample of NUR 101 students who have completed the one credit hour Introduction to
College and Online Literacy (LIB 101)? The findings will then be applied via individual
examinations of the four sub-questions and their resulting hypotheses in light of the
results of the knowledge-based assessment and of the Emergent Themes from the
interviews. Table 5, for easier comparison, can be found following the discussion of the
hypotheses. The discussion will then return to the theoretical frameworks upon which
the research project was developed, discuss ideas for future research, and conclude the
study.

109
Hypotheses Subsets
Hypothesis 1: Source Selection
1. What resources do students in the samples tend to rely on for research, and why do
they rely upon them?
Hypothesis 1a: NOLIB students will utilize limited open access collections of
information freely available to the general public. LIB students will know—and know
how—to utilize broader collections of information including library databases and
discipline-specific information.

Hypothesis 1b: NOLIB students will rely mostly on information with little or no
evaluation from the open web the open web. LIB students will rely on resources with at
least a minimum of vetting via inclusion in a library catalog or database collection.

Questions 3 and 4 of the knowledge-based assessment attempted to capture what
sources students most commonly used to BEGIN (Question 3) and to rely upon MOST
(Question 4) for completing course assignments. Because the Chi-square analysis was
invalidated due to low response rate to some questions, the frequencies of answers
(Appendix F) were examined for any differences among the answers of the two samples.
Overall, the frequencies showed that students, regardless of completion, relied most
heavily on open web sites, with some additional reliance on library databases and on
textbooks.
The two questions could also have been better worded. For example, were
students confused by format versus type of periodical? The inclusion of magazines and

110
journals as well as online databases (which primarily include magazines and journals in
the STLCC collection) may have required students who accessed magazines and journals
via the library databases to choose between use of the print periodicals and use of the
periodicals via an online collection. Additionally, per the interview/focus group
transcriptions, nursing students are instructed to primarily rely upon their textbooks for
most NUR 101 assignments and for other pre-requisite courses, such as Anatomy and
Physiology. Finally, the question was general in nature—the phrase for “college
papers/presentations/projects” was used because, as these were nursing students and the
assessment was administered at the beginning of their nursing curriculum, they would not
yet have been assigned nursing projects. Would the responses have been different if the
assessment had been administered later in their nursing curriculum and the question was
limited to nursing papers/presentations/projects rather than any college assignment?
Interviews addressed the types of resources the students relied upon for research.
Emergent Themes 1 and 11 provided some evidence that while all the students
interviewed began with an open web search due to their familiarity with Google (or
another search engine) as well as convenience (many began researching with their phone
or other mobile device), the students who had not completed LIB 101 continued to rely
primarily upon the open web for most of their resources, while those who had completed
LIB 101 followed up with library database and sometimes library catalog searches.
However, this was not only a matter of convenience (or laziness); Emergent Theme 7
suggested that in their reliance on Google, student nurses are replicating what they see
professionals doing in healthcare locations. Emergent Theme 4 supported the

111
knowledge-based assessment to some degree, in finding that student nurses rely heavily
on their textbooks. Again, the fact that the resource questions were vague as well as that
the knowledge-based assessment was administered at the beginning of the first semester
of nursing classes compared to the interviews taking place about mid-semester may have
affected the outcomes. Nursing students may not have relied as heavily upon their
textbooks in pre-nursing courses (reflected in the knowledge-based assessment) but
began doing so once the nursing curriculum began. Finally, reliance on peers was not
included as an option in the knowledge-based assessment, but it was referred to by
several interviewees.
Consequently, although possibly due to the timing of the assessment and an
uncertainty of the response options, H1 was not statistically supported by the quantitative
portion of the study. However, the interviews from the qualitative portion did provide
some evidence that the second sample did rely less heavily on open web resources found
via search engines. Unfortunately, the low level of participation in the interviews (and
especially the low level of participation by students who had completed LIB 101) may
have limited the ability to get a closer approximation of the second sample’s relied upon
resources.
Hypothesis 2. Source Evaluation
2. How do students in the samples tend to evaluate and to verify—to determine
credibility and reliability—of information resources?

112
Hypothesis 2: The first sample of students will not demonstrate an understanding
of how to verify information—especially that found on the open web. The second
sample will identify some means of verifying information.

Hypothesis 2 was addressed by Question 5 of the knowledge-based assessment.
Question 5 measured how many students would identify the “best” way to verify the
accuracy and credibility of articles or other research found on the web. The Chi-square
analysis suggested that there was not a significant relationship between the correct
answer on Question 5 and completion of the LIB 101 course. When the frequencies
(Appendix F) were examined, slightly more students who had completed LIB 101
answered correctly (A) than those who had not completed the course; however, more
students who had completed the course also responded with one of the incorrect options
(B). One positive result was that none of the students who had completed the course said
that Wikipedia should be used to verify accuracy and credibility of online sources, but a
few students who had not completed LIB 101 did. That a number of students who had
completed LIB 101 thought that the best way to verify information on the open web was
to see if the site itself linked to known reputable web sites or other resources suggested
that information evaluation—especially that of open web sites—may not be stressed
enough in the LIB 101 course.
Accuracy, credibility, and reliability of sources—particularly freely accessible
online resources—was addressed in the interviews. Emergent Theme 3 provided
evidence that students found the web unreliable and were often disappointed in their

113
search results. That disappointment and unreliability, though, did not deter students from
using freely available online sources. Emergent Theme 9 indicated that students are
aware of the need to critically evaluate information, but they are poor critical thinkers.
Most students wanted lists of sources or of specific collections to find answers, rather
than wanting to learn techniques of critical thinking.
To summarize, H2 was not statistically supported by quantitative evidence.
However, the interviews did provide some evidence that the nursing students, whether or
not they had completed the LIB 101 course, realized that dependence upon open web
search engines (whether through a computer, tablet, or phone) was problematic due to the
quality of the information found. The interviews suggested that the students did attempt
to critically think about information, but often lacked the knowledge and skills to do so.
Again, perhaps methods of critically thinking about and evaluating resources need to be
expanded and/or emphasized in the LIB 101 course.
Hypothesis 3: Identification of Scholarly Research
3. Do students in the samples understand the idea of scholarly research published
in peer reviewed resources? Can they recognize scholarly research, and do they know
how to find it?

Hypothesis 3: The first sample of students will not recognize aspects of scholarly
research and will be unable to identify means of finding such research. The
second sample will demonstrate a better understanding of the characteristics of
and the means of accessing scholarly research.

114

Questions 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the knowledge-based assessment focused on
scholarly sources. Chi-square analysis found that there was a statistically significant
relationship between completion of the course and Question 8—identifying from a list the
characteristic not necessarily associated with a scholarly article. However, Chi-square
analysis found no statistically significant relationships between completion of the course
and Questions 9, 10, and 11 (identification from provided lists: the most important aspect
of a scholarly article that differentiates it from a popular resource, the basic definition of
an academic journal, and the health related database). Question 10 may have been
affected by the use of academic journals (usually in a generalized fashion) by faculty of
some general education. For example, anecdotally, English Composition instructors,
especially those teaching ENG 102 and assigning a formal research paper, require the use
of one article from an academic journal. Personal experience in teaching the “one-shots”
for such classes has shown that the academic journal requirement does not necessarily
require students to identify and use scholarly articles (some faculty merely require any
article—including essays and opinion pieces—from an academic journal), but it does
serve to introduce students to academic sources. As the English department is one of the
more library-friendly departments, it may be that the students who did not complete LIB
101 were aware of academic journals in general (Question 10), and had heard the term
“peer reviewed” (Question 9), but were not aware of various sections of primary
research, such as literature review, methods/methodology, etc. as asked in Question 8.
Question 11 may have been problematic as some nursing students do find scholarly

115
articles in Academic Search Elite and in Science Full-Text as well as CINAHL and other
health related databases. It may have been that of the small sample of students who
completed LIB 101, only a few had used and/or would recognize CINAHL; similar to the
findings from Pravikoff, Tanner, & Pierce’s survey of the information literacy skills of
practicing nurses (2005).
Student concepts of scholarly articles and/or health related databases were
addressed in the interviews via Emergent Themes 8 and 10. Emergent Theme 8
suggested that, on one hand, many of the students in the first sample had no clear
understanding between an article database and a library catalog, much less specific
discipline related databases. The students who were familiar with the databases found the
collection of databases “overwhelming” and did not know where to begin. On the other
hand, students from the second sample identified health related databases for article use,
and one student also referred to the use of MOBIUS, the library consortium through
which students at the College can borrow materials from other academic libraries, as well
as interlibrary loan use for articles not available through the College Libraries in full-text.
Emergent Theme 10 provided evidence that the students who did not complete LIB 101
cannot describe a scholarly article and that, if they had already been assigned the related
nursing assignment, felt unprepared and intimidated by it. Unfortunately, all three
interviewees who had completed LIB 101 had not yet been assigned the nursing scholarly
article project. However, after it was described to them, they did feel prepared to meet
the challenge due to their experiences in LIB 101. Again, timing may have affected the
outcomes of both the knowledge-based assessment as well as the interviews; in

116
particular, the timing of the interviews was not static and included some students who
may have revisited concepts while completing or at least contemplating the nursing
scholarly article assignment as opposed to others who had not yet received the
assignment.
H3 was statistically supported by Question 8 of the quantitative portion of the
study, but the Chi-square analyses of Questions 9, 10, and 11 did not provide any
evidence of a relationship between the scholarly article related queries and course
completion. The Emergent Themes from the qualitative investigation suggested that
students who completed LIB 101 not only understand the concept of scholarly articles as
published in academic journals, but also feel prepared to find them.
Hypothesis 4: Use of Keyword Search Techniques
4. How do nursing students in their first program semester search for health and or other
information? Do they understand basic keyword search techniques?

Hypothesis 4: The first sample of students will not demonstrate the knowledge and
ability to determine search strategies. The second sample will demonstrate the ability to
use Boolean operators and other keyword search strategies.

Questions 12 and 13 of the knowledge-based assessment attempted to assess
students’ abilities regarding keyword searching. Chi-square analysis found a statistically
significant relationship between identifying the correctly written nested Boolean search
and course completion, providing evidence that the second sample of students was able to

117
demonstrate Boolean search skill knowledge while the first sample could not. The Chisquare analysis of Question 12, regarding identifying the best search function to use to
begin to find resources on a complicated topic, did not suggest a significant relationship
and the frequencies of answers was examined. Again, while it is not a significant finding,
it should be noted that the first sample included “Title Search” and “I do not know” as
answers whereas the second sample limited answers to either “Keyword Search” or
“Subject Search,” suggesting that they (the second sample) was at least more familiar
with search functions for topical information. The Emergent Themes 9 and 11 from the
qualitative study suggested that students who had not taken LIB 101 did not feel
comfortable with searching in general while students who had completed the course felt
comfortable using keyword search techniques. Overall, H4 was supported in part by both
the quantitative and the qualitative portions of the study.

Hypothesis

119
Research Question
The entirety of the research study was based on the Conceptual Question: How
does the completion of a one-credit hour information literacy course affect the
information behavior and the information literacy skills of samples of students in an
introductory nursing course? From that, the Research question developed:

Specifically, how does a sample of Fundamentals of Nursing (NUR 101) students who
have had no prior formal information literacy instruction locate, access, and use
information as compared to a sample of NUR 101 students who have completed the one
credit hour Introduction to College and Online Literacy (LIB 101)?

Hypothesis: The findings will indicate that the students who complete LIB 101 prior to
enrollment in NUR 101 will significantly demonstrate better information literacy
behavior than the students who do not complete the information literacy course.

In addition to the evidence presented with the subsets of the Hypotheses, the Chisquare test for association found a statistically significant relationship between the
transformed knowledge-based assessment data (Correct2) and course completion
(Completion): X2 (3, N = 153) = 19.03, p = .00. The statistically significant relationship
between Correct2 and Completion suggested that students who complete LIB 101
performed significantly better than the students who did not complete LIB 101.
Likewise, the Point-Biserial correlation found relationships between each of the
independent variables (COURSE and LIBRARY) and the Information Literacy Score

120
(CORRECT). A low, significant, and positive relationship was found between the course
level and the information literacy score, rpb = .26, p = .01, which also indicates that
students who completed LIB 101 tended to have higher information literacy scores on the
knowledge-based assessment than students who had not. However, a low, significant,
and positive relationship was also found between library exposure and the information
literacy score, rpb = .23, p = .01, indicating that students with more forms of library
exposure tend to have higher information literacy scores than those who have fewer
forms of library exposure. Similarly, the Regression Analysis suggested that while the
completion of LIB 101 (COURSE) was a significant predictor of the information literacy
score: t(150) = 2.12, p < .05, it also indicated that library exposure (LIBRARY) was a
significant predictor: t(150) = 2.52, p < .05.
The results of the Point-Biserial Correlation and the Regression Analysis
suggested that the LIB 101 course overlap with library exposure might have affected the
students’ submission of correct responses on the knowledge-based assessment.
Additionally, the Emergent Theme 11 suggested that the completion of LIB 101 prepared
students for the evidence based professional training in the nursing curriculum by
providing them with information seeking skills, knowledge of various information
collections, improved information behavior, and confidence. The evidence provided by
the project in its entirety suggests that, yes; students who complete LIB 101 prior to
enrollment in NUR 101 significantly demonstrate better information literacy behavior
than the students who do not complete the information literacy course.

121
Returning to the Theoretical Frameworks
The performance of the student nurses on the knowledge-based assessment, as
well as their experiences and beliefs regarding information shared during the interviews,
can be tied to Chatman’s theory of Information Poverty and to Belkin’s Anomalous
States of Knowledge: student nurses are marginalized by lack of previous knowledge
and access (as are many community college students), and many do not realize the
limitations of their information seeking behavior. In the interviews, the student nurses
often referred to their various small worlds—their families, their nursing class cohort, and
clinical units. Students also often referred to the information world as “scary” and
“overwhelming” and worried about needing to keep up with various software programs
and other technologies used by different hospitals, clinics, medical offices, etc.,
suggesting that the students suffer from library, information, and/or computer anxiety as
originally theorized by Mellon. Such varied literacies, in turn, hinted at Mackey and
Jacobson’s idea of the need for Metaliteracy in the digital age. Lastly, the fruits of the
study are also reflected in Gross and Latham’s theory of Competency and Confidence
(based upon the Dunning-Kruger effect)—although this seemed somewhat cyclical:
students who did not have critical thinking skills and did not know what scholarly nursing
literature was thought that they could just find resources on the open web and make a
decision regarding its credibility and reliability simply based upon a quick read-over.
Others, once confronted with the knowledge that their skills simply wouldn’t work for
evidence based nursing, lost that confidence and felt “intimidated.” Those who
completed the LIB 101 class seemed to make parallel strides in competency and

122
confidence. That is, while they gained some confidence by being more knowledgeable
and experienced than their NOLIB peers, the LIB students might lose that confidence as
additional gaps surfaced.
Future Study
There is much room for further study—not only within the confines of the effect
of LIB 101 on the nursing students of the Campus—but the effect of information literacy
instruction on nursing students at the College, as well as on both student nurses and
practicing nurses, generally. Beside the need for future attempts to overcome the
limitations of the possible course overlap with library exposure—particularly exposure
from general education course instruction and assignments—unfortunate timing, low
participation (especially in the difficulty of including students who had completed the
course due to “grandfathering”), awkwardly worded questions, and other limitations
herein discussed, one example of future avenues of investigation was suggested by the
interviews. One of the words most used by the students in the interviews was
“overwhelm” and statements from several participants suggested that the nursing students
felt overwhelmed not only by the amount of information to become a nurse, but also by
the rate of change of information in the nursing field. Missouri is one of the states that
does not require nurses to complete formal continuing education (American Nurses
Association, 2011). Given the findings of this study, the lack of formal continuing
education is particularly is troubling. The future of nursing relies upon evidence based
practice, and, ultimately, evidence based practice relies on information literate nurses.

123
Additionally, the findings of the research did not specifically refer to the
conceptual frameworks of Metaliteracy and of High Reliability Organizations. However,
some statements from the qualitative portion, including references to the need to
understand hospital software and communications as well as the trust placed in nurses,
suggested the need for further such related investigations. The need for nurses (and
student nurses) to be technically savvy and to be continuous learners in regards to quickly
changing and developing tools, devices, software, etc., requires nurses to be literate in
much more than information literacy. Simple tools such as the thermometer and blood
pressure cuff have changed dramatically and may differ in application in various medical
settings. More complex tools, such as software based and online nursing charts, may
require specialized and ongoing training. How does the ongoing development of such
tools and their use affect nurses and their ability to effectively provide patient care?
How does the theory of High Reliability (Organization) affect nurses? Nursing
class cohorts as well as clinical units could be framed as within a High Reliability
Organizational Culture as defined by Weick. These first year student nurses, while not
yet feeling the pressure of the responsibility for others’ health and life, are burdened by
the high stakes of the nursing courses and of the test-based licensure examinations. As
such, they tend to follow already determined paths, such as wanting to know what articles
to use, what procedures to follow, etc., rather than innovating and devising new paths.
While the concept was important to the development of the research, the findings did not
specifically address how nurses hold a high level of responsibility--the very lives of their

124
patients. How does this responsibility weigh on nurses and student nurses and how does
it affect their ability to incorporate new concepts in nursing?
Finally, as the ACRL Framework was adopted after the development of this
study, research in light of the Framework threshold concepts should be undertaken. How
does the flexibility of the Framework lend itself to Nursing? Is the malleable nature of
the Framework conducive to researching EBP or is a more exacting set of standards more
useful?
Conclusion
A perfect storm is brewing in the nursing profession. As the profession
increasingly relies upon its practitioners to keep current and to deliver care grounded in
evidence based practice, nurses will increasingly need to effectively find and use the
pertinent information from an ever-growing body of research. This study provides
evidence that an information literacy course significantly affected the information literacy
skills of student nurses in a community college nursing program. By continuing to
research with the goal of improving the instruction of information literacy concepts by
better understanding the information behavior of nursing students, librarians can help
such students improve their understanding and use of information—and their abilities to
engage in evidence based practice nursing. By empowering nursing students with
information literacy knowledge and skills, librarians can perhaps help nurses to better
treat and assist their patients and to ultimately improve healthcare in the nation.

a. Identifies the various disciplines publishing research on the concepts of the question (e.g.,
health sciences, biology, psychology).
b. Identifies the publication types in the progression from background (e.g., encyclopedia,
textbooks) to foreground research (e.g., primary literature).
c. Identifies likely type of publication where appropriate information is published (e.g., popular
vs. trade vs. scholarly, current vs. seminal, primary vs. secondary vs. tertiary).
d. Considers experts or other researchers as potential information resources.
e. Identifies the value and differences of potential resources in a variety of formats (e.g.,
multimedia, database, website, data set, audio/visual, book, graph).
f. Recognizes that information may need to be constructed with raw data from primary
sources or by primary research.

144
g. Recognizes that potentially useful information or data in a variety of formats may be
proprietary, have limited access, or may be freely available online.
3. Has a working knowledge of the literature in nursing related fields and how it is produced.
Outcomes include:
a. Recognizes how scientific, medical, and nursing practice information is formally and
informally produced, organized, and disseminated.
b. Recognizes the primary sources of nursing: Empirical/original research, conference
proceedings, dissertations, technical reports, or informal online communication.
c. Recognizes the secondary sources of nursing: Reviews, systematic reviews, metaanalyses, evidence summaries, or guidelines.
d. Identifies professional associations of the field and their literature.
e. Identifies sources that are specific to the field, e.g. manuals, handbooks standards, etc.
f. Recognizes that knowledge can be organized into disciplines and combinations of
disciplines (multidisciplinary) that influence the way information is accessed.
g. Recognizes the value of archival information, recognizes how its use and importance may
vary with each discipline, and recognizes the importance of preservation of information.
4. Considers the costs and benefits of acquiring the needed information.
Outcomes include:
a. Determines the availability of needed information and makes decisions on broadening the
information seeking process beyond locally held resources.
b. Takes advantage of continuing education opportunities to acquire new skills.
c. Formulates a realistic overall plan and timeline to acquire the needed information.
d. Recognizes that information needed may be in a foreign language and that translation may
be necessary.
e. Locates research instruments (questionnaires, scales, interview guides) and identifies if
they are appropriate to their populations.
f. Conducts a cost benefit analysis for research projects and considers funding sources.
g. Interprets the complexities of accessing full text and the various publishing models.
5. Reevaluates the nature and extent of the information need.
Outcomes include:
a. Understands that research is an iterative process, and a process of discovering what
research has been published on a topic to focus a research question.
b. Evaluates and refines original PICO(TT) question in relation to the literature found.
c. Points out evidence gaps in the literature.
d. Describes criteria used to make information choices.

Standard Two
The information literate nurse accesses needed information effectively and efficiently.

Performance Indicators:

145
The information literate nurse:
1. Selects the most appropriate investigative methods or information retrieval systems for
accessing the needed information.
Outcomes Include:
a. Recognizes where to look for research literature and other sources of evidence at each
stage of the research process.
b. Investigates the scope, content, and organization of information retrieval systems.
c. Selects efficient and effective approaches for accessing the information needed from an
information retrieval system.
d. Locates primary or secondary quantitative or qualitative data.
2. Constructs and implements efficient and effectively-designed search strategies.
Outcomes Include:
a. Formulates a strategic approach to searching the diverse resources available to address
each element of the PICO(TT) question.
b. Identifies keywords, synonyms and related terms for the information needed.
c. Identifies the differences between keyword and subject searching and articulates how to
use each independently, or in combination, to complete a comprehensive search.
d. Navigates hierarchies of subject terms (e.g., MeSH and CINAHL) and utilizes scope notes,
subheadings, and searching in a thesaurus.
e. Constructs a search strategy using appropriate commands for the information retrieval
system selected (e.g., Boolean operators, truncation, and adjacency; internal organizers
such as indexes for books).
f. Recognizes similarities and differences across user interfaces (e.g. field codes, command
languages, and search parameters).
g. Develops search strategies to locate nursing theories and philosophies.
h. Implements search strategies to locate grey literature such as conference proceedings,
theses, dissertations, and white papers.
i. Follows citations and cited references to identify additional, pertinent articles.
3. Retrieves information online or in person using a variety of methods.
Outcomes Include:
a. Uses various search systems to retrieve information in a variety of formats (e.g., the library
catalog, general and specialized databases, and authoritative websites).
b. Uses various classification schemes and other systems to locate information resources
within the library.
c. Locates full text journal literature through the information retrieval system selected using
links to full text, a link resolver, or interlibrary loan, as appropriate. Does not artificially limit
to only readily available full text within the database.
d. Uses online or in-person services when assistance is needed (e.g., interlibrary loan,
document delivery, librarians, library staff, primary investigators).
e. Uses surveys, letters, interviews, experiments, and other forms of inquiry to retrieve
information or data, as appropriate for the research area or discipline.

146
4. Refines the search strategy if necessary.
Outcomes Include:
a. Uses limiters (e.g., year, population, age, English-language, geographical location, human
studies).
b. Uses publication type limits to identify and locate the appropriate level of evidence within
the information retrieval system (e.g., qualitative studies, reviews of literature, controlled
trials, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews).
c. Adjusts search strategy to access clinical opinions, research, or evidence summaries
according to information need.
d. Selects appropriate subject headings from records of relevant articles to refine search
statements (aka “pearl growing”).
e. Assesses the quantity, quality, accuracy, currency, and relevance of the search results and
the limitations of the information retrieval systems or investigative methods, to determine
whether alternatives should be sought and utilized.
f. Identifies gaps in the information retrieved and determines if the search strategy should be

Student Focus Group/Interview Protocol

Research question: How do community college students in a 100 level introductory nursing
course (NUR 101) research to find information for college papers/presentations/projects and/or
for their own knowledge?
Background: Students will have already completed a short survey in class. The focus
group/interviews will help flesh out the understanding of the results of the survey.
Data Collection Method: I will hold a focus group or individual interviews with NUR 101
students of St. Louis Community College, LMCCC1
Participants: Students will be interviewed in a focus group setting or individually, depending
upon scheduling and availability.
Sample Size: I anticipate a sample size from 8 to 10 students.
Ethical Issues: Permission to interview and to record the audio proceedings will be obtained.
Those who do not provide consent will not participate. The first names of the students will be
recorded for ease in transcription; however, that information will not be shared as part of the
results; instead, students will be identified by number rather than by name.
Data Collection Protocol: I will request student participation during the administration of the
survey. The focus group participants will be chosen purposefully in that both course sections
should be represented; but still randomly from among those interested. The focus group will last
approximately thirty minutes and will take place outside of the library proper. The focus group
will be audio-digitally recorded and transcribed. Once transcribed, the recordings will be
destroyed. The focus group guidelines and questions follow below.
Focus Group Guidelines
Introduction
Good morning! I’m Katy Smith, and I’ll be moderating today’s focus group on the research and
information seeking of NUR 101 students. We have scheduled 30 minutes to complete this focus
group/interview. Thank you again for arranging your schedules to participate. The purpose of
this focus group is to record your information use. Please feel free to make comments, negative
or positive, about the things we will be discussing. This is a free-flowing discussion, and there
are no right or wrong answers. Before we get started, let’s go over some disclosures and ground
rules.
Disclosures
1. CONFIDENTIALITY. Everything that you say here will be kept strictly confidential.
Nothing said in this group will ever be associated with any individual by name. I also ask
that you similarly maintain the confidentiality of what is said in the group.

172
2. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION. Your participation in this group is entirely voluntary.
You may stop participating at any time. You do not have to answer any questions that you do
not wish to answer. You may withdraw from the group at any time with no consequences.
3. AUDIORECORDING. This session is being digitally audio-recorded so that I can write an
accurate report of the discussion—not of who in particular said what. If there are any
objections we will not record the session. Are there any objections?
4. Great! Thank you! Thank you for arranging your schedule today to be here for this session. I
truly appreciate you giving me your time and opinions.
I know that we all know and respect each other; but, to ensure that everyone’s input is shared and
valued, we do have some ground rules to help us make the focus group productive.
Ground Rules
1. Please talk one at a time and in a voice as loud as mine.
2. Please avoid side conversations with your neighbors.
3. We need to hear from everyone in the course of the discussion, but you don’t have to answer
every question.
4. Please listen to each other.
5. Feel free to respond directly to someone who has made a point. You don’t have to address
your comments to me to get them on the table. Criticism of others or their ideas is not
allowed.
6. Say what is true for you and have the courage of your conviction. Don’t let the group sway
you and don’t “sell out” to group opinion.
7. We will finish on time.

Focus Group Questions:
1. Opening Question
