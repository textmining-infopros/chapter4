Abstract
A Model of Urban Public Library Service
For Underserved Groups: Information & Literacy Triage
Adam M. Townes

This study examines the current model of public library service provision to underserved
populations. In the context of this study, underserved populations are understood to be socially
excluded urban populations which include those living in low income areas, minorities, the
homeless and the socially excluded. Because it is an almost omnipresent institution in
communities across the United States, the public library is in the unique position of being able
to help underserved communities on a nationwide scale. Services provided by the public library
can address some of the most conspicuous disparities in society which disproportionally affect
underserved groups–such as poor health practices, low literacy levels, and poor information
access.
Consequently, there is merit in studying the current model of public library services for
underserved groups, particularly how public library services are addressing the information
needs of underserved groups and how they are working to support basic life needs, providing
technology access, and supporting educational achievement. Insight gained from a study of this
phenomenon would be useful for public library practice because it sheds light on obstacles to
provision of public library services to underserved groups, identifies gaps in service provision,
expands the literature on trends in library services to guide future research, and presents
recommendations for future approaches to service provision.

Chapter 1: Introduction
Introduction
Public-library service to underserved groups was first introduced in the United States in
the late 1800’s, but only on a limited basis (Lumumba and Branton, 2002; Harris, 1972). In the
early 1900’s, specific public-library services for underserved groups became widespread in the
form of services meant to “Americanize” immigrants and to teach them English. However, it is
the 1960’s that stand out as the time when the most concerted efforts in public-library outreach
to underserved groups began. After the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) was passed
in 1956, public libraries across the country used federal funding to construct new facilities and
to develop a number of new services targeted toward underserved groups (Library Services and
Construction Act Amendments of 1970, 1970). In 1970, Title 1 of the LSCA was officially
expanded to stipulate that funding would be used for special library services for
“disadvantaged” people and for strengthening metropolitan libraries.
While the passage and expansion of the LSCA do not represent the beginning of
outreach efforts by the library profession, they do represent a turning point in terms of the
availability of funding and of the social atmosphere of the time. Since the passage of LSCA,
public-library services for underserved groups have gone through a number of incarnations.
These incarnations reflect society’s understanding of what constitutes an underserved group,
what the purpose of government funding is, what segments of the population are recognized as
underserved, and how to provide access to the information needed by those underserved
groups in a rapidly changing information society.
Some of the information science literature has characterized public-library service
provision to underserved groups as episodic and lacking in any real commitment, dedication, or

2

consistency (Alexander, 2008; Bundy, 1982; Casey, 1974; Holt, 2006; Koontz, Jue, Bishop, 2009;
Lipsman, 1972; Metoyer-Duran, 1993; Sin, 2011; Stern, 1991; Wray, 1976). It is certainly true
that, over the decades, public-library services provided for underserved groups in the United
States have ebbed and flowed around common themes. Certainly, the types of services and
methods used to provide those services largely correspond to “models” (Stern, 1991), “trends”
(Estabrook, 1979), or “styles” (Weibel, 1982)–which can be characterized as episodes in service
provision.
In terms of library history, four forces appear to have driven the occurrence of these
episodes. First, the American Library Association publishes standards for the accreditation of
graduate programs offering the master’s degree in library and information science. These
standards, first issued around 1926 (Drake, 2005) and periodically revised since then, impose
some uniformity in how librarians across the country are trained. Put simply, librarians across
the United States receive very similar educations, thus learning very similar methods of service
provision. As the standards are periodically updated and the various schools adapt their
programs to meet the new requirements, library education, and by extension library practice,
reflects the trends embedded in the standards.
A second driving force in library trends is embodied in the library literature and
conferences. Publications, reports, and conference presentations serve to publicize and spread
information about emerging services and methods, thus serving to drive change in the library
profession.
A third driving factor, and perhaps the most influential one, is found in the funding
streams that are available to public libraries. For instance, major changes in service provision
appear to have followed legislation regulating both the amount of money allotted for public

3

libraries over time and the ways the funds are to be used. The passage of the original LSCA was
meant to provide funding for library service in underserved and/or disadvantaged communities
(Daniels, 1989). Changes to the LSCA in the 1990’s refocused the emphasis of federal funding
from physical infrastructure to technological infrastructure, while services to underserved
groups remained a priority despite the change. Increases and decreases in funding have also had
an effect. Bundy (1982) and Nauratil (1985) observe that, in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s,
decreases in federal spending on social and educational programs affected public-library service
to underserved groups. In particular, Bundy (1982) indicates that decreases in funding at the
time led to reductions in service and thus the failure or discontinuation of some services for
underserved groups. The literature also indicates that many of the services implemented for
underserved groups over time have failed or been discontinued because of lack of funding
suggested by low-usage statistics (Bundy, 1982).
A fourth driving factor, may be the inability of public libraries to attract the interest of
the target population (Lipsman, 1972) or to represent their interests accurately (Koontz et al.,
2009). In either case, public libraries would need to shift the services provided or change the
types of usage statistics that are collected.
The observed episodic nature of public-library service provision for underserved groups
may actually be more perceptual than factual and may be partially attributable to gaps in the
library literature that can be misleading. A review of the descriptive library literature and
several public libraries’ current service offerings presents evidence that contradicts the
observation that many services have failed. For instance, according to the Detroit Public
Library’s website, TIP (The Information Place) service mentioned by Berry in 1975 is still in
existence. Similarly, Enoch Pratt’s website INFER (Information for Every Resident), mentioned

4

by Bundy in 1982, is still active. A lack of citable literature in this instance indeed supports the
point that episodes in public-library service provision are at least partially based on gaps in the
literature.
There seem to be three possible explanations for discrepancies about services found in
the literature. The first is the sporadic reporting on services. Estabrook (1979), Weibel (1982),
and Holt and Holt (2010) attribute the small number of references to failed services to the fact
that there is typically no follow-up after an initial report on a service is made; therefore, there is
no reliable tracking of successes and failures. Indeed, the researcher’s literature review and
subsequent follow-up did not confirm that many services were failing or being discontinued:
while the review confirmed that many of the service reports did not feature follow-ups, Internet
searches and a survey of public-library websites almost invariably indicated the continued
provision of services named in the reports. This finding could indicate that informal education
and professional communication practices enforce a nature of trending because of a focus on
emerging trends and a lack of follow-up reporting.
The second explanation may relate more directly to the chronology of reports of failed
or discontinued services. Many of the discontinued services appear to have begun in the 1960’s,
when many public libraries first began to explore the provision of services to underserved
groups. Hiatt (1965) points out that, in the early to mid-1960’s, public libraries in urban areas
were having trouble coping with the influx of less-educated migrants from rural areas who were
replacing the comparatively well-educated users to whom they were accustomed. Because of
the changing demographics of library users, libraries were hindered both by a lack of knowledge
of how to reach the new urban residents and by the new population’s unfamiliarity with services
offered by the library. Indeed, Colson (1973) notes that Milton Byam, then Director of the

5

District of Columbia Public Library, stated that all the outreach programs he knew had been
failures. Lipsman (1972) indicates that, generally, urban public libraries serving underserved
groups had failed in their outreach efforts. However, many services implemented after 1970 did
not fail but continue to this day. This situation may be due to the implementation of the
information and referral (I&R) service model, exemplified by such services as TIP (Detroit, 2015),
INFER (Baltimore) (Enoch Pratt Free Library, 2015) and LINC (Memphis) (LINC Staff, 2015.)
The third explanation for the discrepancies in the literature may lie in whether the term
“service” is defined generally (i.e., to indicate that a library is “providing service” to a
community) or specifically (i.e., to describe a particular service or program). Note that, in the
context of this study, library programs are viewed as a prominent type of service that is
provided on a non-permanent, as-needed basis. Lipsman (1972) and more recently Koontz et al.
(2009) indicate that public-library service is discontinued to communities when branches are
closed because low usage statistics suggest a failure to reach residents effectively. Thus, the
discontinuation of public-library service to a community rather than the discontinuation of a
specific service may account for some of the discrepancies in reports of the history and current
state of service provision to underserved groups.
Statement of the Problem
Given the episodic nature of public-library service provision as well as the inconsistency
of service reporting in the library literature, the researcher is compelled to ask: what is one
model of public-library services currently provided to underserved groups and what factors
underlie the existence of this model? Given that changes have occurred in library practice,
technology, education, federal funding priorities for libraries, available resources, preparedness
of patrons for research, changing priorities in local school systems, generational differences in

6

the ways people access information, and government regulatory policies, there is a clear need to
identify a current service model. No study has explored and defined a current model of publiclibrary services for urban underserved groups that accounts for the technology-based services
that are currently being provided, the existence of gaps in such services, and the obstacles that
librarians face in providing the services.
Urban public libraries carry a unique context within public librarianship because many
citizens in urban settings who frequent the libraries have low incomes and/or are in need of
particular social services that are not necessarily within the realm of traditional public-library
service (Irvin Morris, 2012). Insight gained from a study of the contemporary state of affairs
would be useful for public-library practice because it would shed light on the issues driving the
current style of public-library services provision to underserved groups, expand the literature on
trends in library services, guide future research, and enable development of recommendations
for future approaches to service provision.
Historically, underserved populations have been defined as those who have been
denied full and equal participation in the economic, social, and institutional activities of society
(Civil Rights Act, 1964). Populations have been underserved because of geographic location;
racial and ethnic traits; and special needs—that is, barriers caused by multiple languages,
disabilities, lack of permanent residency or citizenship status, illiteracy, low literacy rates, and
age. Underserved populations have variously been identified as poor; needy; culturally deprived;
underprivileged; disadvantaged; and, more recently, diverse. The socially excluded segments of
society that the library community has identified as “needy” or “underserved” have shifted, just
as society’s and the library profession’s conception of who is disadvantaged or underserved has
shifted. Recent terms like “have-nots”, used in reference to the digital divide, and “diverse

7

populations” used in reference to groups that are underrepresented in the professions, highlight
the evolution of our understanding of what it is to be underserved. In the context of this study,
the term “underserved” is understood to mean new Americans as well as communities with low
levels of income, literacy, and education.
Justification of Importance
Comprehensive exploration of how practitioners are currently filling the needs of
underserved populations could benefit the public-library service planning literature by detailing
successful and useful services that public libraries are already providing to underserved groups.
Furthermore, by examining the how public librarians identify the needs of underserved patrons
and resultant service coverage as well as how public librarians determine services to meet the
identified needs and plan those services would be of great use to libraries and to LIS education
programs.
More significantly, exploring and defining a current model of public-library services for
urban underserved groups is important in order to fill a gap in the library and information
science literature. Outlining the existence of a newer model is necessary given that
technological change, economic conditions, and the emergence of new types and methods of
service provision can result in new service gaps and obstacles to service provision which were
not encountered in the past. Study of the contemporary state of affairs and identification of the
issues driving the current style of public-library service provision to underserved groups are
important for a number of reasons because it provides an opportunity to expand the existing LIS
literature that has examined trends in library services to underserved groups. By continuing to
identify, document, and describe new models of service provision, researchers can come to
understand the forces that underlie the corresponding set of practices, gaps, obstacles, and

8

public librarian’s responses to various underserved patron needs. Research could thus provide
the library profession with a longitudinal record of both underserved patron needs and
corresponding service responses.
What an historical perspective on public libraries and underserved groups suggests is
that public-library services can have an important impact on the lives of underserved groups.
Research indicates that such services have long had positive economic, educational, and
occupational effects on communities and individuals able to access them (Becker et al., 2010;
Fels, 2010). Because it is an almost omnipresent institution in communities across the United
States, the public library is in the unique position of being able to help underserved
communities on a nationwide scale. Thus, there is great potential for the public library to reach
many underserved segments of the U.S. population with information services that can help to
address their information needs (Childers, 1975; Chatman, 1991; Agada, 1999). Services
provided by the public library can address some of the most conspicuous disparities in society
which disproportionally affect underserved groups–such as poor health practices, low literacy
levels, and poor information access (Agada, 1999; Childers, 1975). Another range of issues of
particular importance to underserved groups is defined by a deficit in information-literacy and
digital-literacy skills (Burke, 2008; Casey, 1972, Childers, 1975; Hersberger, 2005; Philadelphia
Research Initiative, 2012). Many of these problems are linked to low education levels, the poor
quality of local public schools, and the persistence of poverty in underserved areas.
Public libraries make several economically valuable contributions to local communities
and users. Through provision of free and low-cost information resources, they support the
development of essential skills and access to information necessary for success in the current
knowledge-based economy (Fels, 2010). Assessing the value of the Free Library of Philadelphia

9

through an analysis of circulation, program, database usage, census and labor statistics, surveys,
and interviews of librarians and patrons, the Fels Institute found that the library creates
economic value for library users and citizens of Philadelphia both in broad areas that are related
to materials circulated and programs and services offered and also in its contribution to higher
property values in areas around service outlets.
In a nationwide study, Becker et al. (2010) found that information and communication
technologies (ICT) provided by the public library increase personal literacy skills. In particular,
patrons used public-library ICTs in order to address needs related to education, employment,
and personal health. For instance, Becker et al. (2010) found that people use public-library
resources to perform a number of tasks related to personal and communal development–such
as locating employment, securing government benefits, finding housing, applying for aid from
FEMA, learning about critical medical treatments, accessing materials on small-business
development, and applying to graduate programs.
At this point it is important to note that even with all that public libraries have done and
are currently doing for underserved groups, the library profession historically has struggled with
serving this large and diverse cross-section of the American population. Wray (1976) emphasizes
that the profession has striven to come to terms with such service provision. Muddiman et al.
(2000) also suggest, that as public libraries continue to modernize their services, the
modernization process is unlikely to result in service provision focused on underserved groups.
Part of the issue may lie with the complexity of what it means to be underserved in general and
with defining what “underserved” means within a local context. The continuous attempts to
define “underserved” are indicative of the struggle within the library profession in particular and
society in general to come to terms with the need to be culturally inclusive and diverse.

10

Chapter 2: Literature Review and Conceptual Framework
The literature related to library services for underserved groups is necessarily broad,
given, in part, the various terms used over the course of almost 50 years’ worth of publications.
In order to make the review most relevant to contemporary conditions, documents before 1964
have not been included, except where historical context was needed. The conceptual
framework for the study is grounded in this literature and is presented at the conclusion of this
chapter.
Nature of the Literature
In an early review of the literature about public libraries, Zweizig and Dervin (1977)
found that this literature was situated across three broad perspectives: normative, empirical,
and research. The first perspective consisted of narrative literature, which was essentially
composed of non-empirical reports and thought pieces. The empirical perspective largely
focused on library statistics and library usage. The third perspective, which accounted for the
smallest proportion of the literature, focused on research on the use of the public library as well
as study of library users’ characteristics and needs.
Although Zweizig and Dervin’s (1977) observations are still fairly accurate today, the
researcher identified the need to alter the categorization scheme to fit the current literature. A
survey of that literature revealed a sizeable number of publications that are either literature
reviews or discussions of conceptual and theoretical aspects of information behavior and
underserved groups. A further survey of the literature suggested an expanded conception of
research that includes both quantitative and qualitative works. Consequently, this literature
review discusses four types of literature: descriptive literature, conceptual/theoretical
publications, literature reviews, and research literature that is both quantitative and qualitative.

11

Descriptive Literature. The descriptive literature reports on public-library services and
offers practical approaches to service provision to underserved groups. Literature in this
category typically expresses experience-based advice; suggestions for types of service offerings;
descriptions of programs offered by libraries or systems meant to appeal to underserved
groups; observations on information-service needs and issues, and thought pieces. This
category of literature generally takes the form of articles in library journals (Adeyemon, 2009;
Holt, 2006) and, in a few cases, monographs such as Venturella’s (1998) or Holt and Holt’s
(2010) that provide scope and context but do not report research studies or provide much depth
in regard to findings or conclusions.
Indeed, Brown (1971) and Weibel (1982) as well as Holt and Holt (2010) indicate that
the literature covering services to underserved groups is primarily descriptive and not the
product of rigorous investigation. Instead, the descriptive works tend to provide both casebased and situationally oriented examples that depict the interaction between public librarians
and underserved populations. Authors of these works do not apply any empirical methodology,
consistent data-gathering techniques, data-analysis procedures, or conceptual models in
exploring the provision of services to or interaction with underserved groups.
The major descriptive works that cover public-library services to underserved groups
include monographs (Brown, 1971; Bundy and Stielow, 1987) and articles (Wray, 1976;
Adeyemon, 2009; Orange & Osborne, 2004). Wray’s article, originally published in 1976, was
reprinted in 2009 by the editors of Public library Quarterly because the editors found Wray’s
article to be a “profoundly contemporary” statement about the issues which public libraries
have consistently faced up to the present time. Wray discusses the historical role of the publiclibrary, especially in relation to the poor; the changing demographics of inner-city populations;

12

and the public-library’s continuous struggle to define and serve the underserved groups of the
United States. Casey (1974) describes similar issues but does so in relation to specific
underserved groups, such as functionally illiterate and elderly people, whom Casey viewed as
typical populations found among the urban underserved. Gehner (2010) considers issues related
to interaction with underserved populations and describes the impact of national library policies
(e.g., ALA Policy 61) that may not be universally applicable across service environments.
Adeyemon (2009) describes libraries’ interaction with underserved groups and reports practical
descriptions of several outreach efforts to them.
The major categories of these works are descriptions of specific services in particular
public libraries and/or systems; discussions of professional issues in dealing with people who are
poor, disabled, members of minority groups, and hampered by low literacy levels; one-time
reports covering implementations of new services; and discussions of the ways that historical
circumstances related to class structures and prejudice have biased public-library services. This
literature informed the researcher’s understanding of the public-library community’s
motivations for serving underserved groups as well as of librarians’ and library researchers’
perceptions of service to underserved groups.
Conceptual/Theoretical Literature. The conceptual literature offers models or theories
that can be applied to understanding the information behavior of underserved populations.
Currently, the major theme in this body of work is the conceptualization of a number of new
literacies, the mastery of which is becoming essential to economic success and viability. Works
in this category provide insight into the needs and problems faced by underserved groups and
offer a clear conception of the environments in which public libraries provide services to
underserved groups. Included are works that analyze concepts such as information inequity (Yu,

13

2006) and information poverty (Thompson, 2006; Haider and Bawden, 2007). A number of
works offer critical discussions of such terms as information literacy (Buschman, 2009) and
information poverty (Haider and Bawden, 2007). As Chatman (1996) pointed out, the concepts
of information poverty and information inequity are often associated with underserved
populations.
The conceptual literature includes works such as those of Haider and Bawden (2007),
Lievrouw and Farb (2003), and Yu (2006). The major theme of these works relates to a
conceptual struggle to identify the relationship between some form of disadvantage and some
form of information inequality. Although disadvantage is certainly related to information
equality, the relationship and corresponding influence of the former on the latter is not always
clear. For example, it may be argued that economic poverty is often associated with lower
levels of access, lower-quality education systems, and lower amounts of available information.
However, these factors alone do not determine how information literate a person may be.
Indeed, Chatman (1996) notes that over the course of her research she found that the link does
not necessarily exist. Moreover, Chatman (1996) identified poverty as only one of a number of
factors that might contribute to an information-impoverished existence. Some of these factors
are explored later in the “Factors that Influence Information Behavior” section of this literature
review.
The conceptual literature informed the present study in two ways. First, the researcher
developed a broad conception of the library and information science community’s perceptions
of underserved groups. Second, this portion of the literature served as a foundation for the
model of contemporary library practice presented in this study.

14

Literature Reviews. A number of literature reviews cover such issues as the impact of
socioeconomic status (Bradley and Corwyn, 2002); geographic location and concentration of
poverty (Millbourne, 2010); and a confluence of systemic and behavioral issues and the
cumulative effect of longitudinal exposure to multiple environmental stressors (Evans, 2004).
These reviews discuss the social, environmental, and psychological factors associated with the
everyday life of underserved populations. Generally, they point to a convergence of factors
(social, structural, economic, behavioral, etc.) that underlie the reasons that underserved
populations seek information. The reviews generally find that issues such as poverty,
neighborhood crime, domestic violence, housing of low and decaying quality, etc., occur in
combination and consequently form a stressful and unsafe everyday environment. These factors
can also be understood in terms of mutually reinforcing societal agents such as the absence of
institutional services, low-quality public education, low levels of educational achievement, and
high crime rates. How these structural and societal agents affect underserved groups is
explored in the “Public-library Services for Underserved Populations” section of this document.
Research Literature. Similar to the empirical literature noted by Zweizig and Dervin in
the late 1970’s, a strand of contemporary literature still focuses on library statistics. It is also
important to note that, while the empirical literature of today is similar in nature to that of the
past, the current studies are generally more expansive in character. Publications by Sin (2011),
Sin and Kim (2008), and Koontz et al. (2009), and Jue et al. (1999) consider library usage
statistics broadly in relation to public-library systems, state and nationwide demographic
factors, spatial location, technology accessibility, Internet speed, number of public-access
computers, and other factors. While Zweizig and Dervin (1977) noted that the empirical
literature of 35 years ago focused on circulation statistics, the contemporary literature uses

15

quantitative data from the Census Bureau, the Public library Survey, and GIS data sources to
profile users and nonusers; to explore disparities in service provision and quality; to identify
relationships between use and geo-spatial location; and to classify usage characteristics in
relation to social, economic, and demographic factors.
Agada (1999), Chatman (1991), and Chatman and Pendleton (1995) agree that understanding
the situational elements (Taylor, 1991) that determine the significance of information to a user
and that affect the flow and use of information by that user provide a useful means for
predicting user needs.
The literature related to these issues is primarily qualitative and it suggests four main
areas of importance to this study: the underlying reasons for information seeking among
underserved groups, the nature of the information sources used by these groups, the general
factors that influence the information behavior of these groups, and the public-library factors
that influence this behavior. The following sections of this chapter detail what the qualitative
literature reveals about these areas, and the chapter concludes with a presentation of the
conceptual framework for the study derived from the findings and theories this literature
suggests.
Underlying Reasons for Information Seeking among Underserved Population
Over 40 years ago, Lipsman (1972) identified many of the same underlying reasons for
information seeking among underserved populations as studies published in the past decade
(Alexander, 2008; Burke, 2008; Hersberger, 2003). In general, the information needs of
underserved groups revolve around such issues as security, crime, education, health, personal
finances, housing, and employment. Problems related to these issues – like substance abuse,

16

legal concerns, etc.— represent a continuity of crisis-oriented practical reasons for seeking
information that are indicative of everyday life circumstances among underserved groups.
In a landmark study of low-income workers; Chatman (1990) describes participants’
need for news about violent crimes, burglary, and acquaintances in trouble with law
enforcement. In a study of a similar population, Agada (1999) identifies race relations, crime,
and family concerns as information needs. Other studies such as those by Bishop, Tidline,
Shoemaker and Salela (1999) and Hersberger (2003) find that underserved people desire
information related to security or crime, health, education, employment, rent money, food, the
location of permanent and stable housing, education for children, personal finances and credit,
substance abuse, and coping with domestic violence. Still other studies by Burke (2008) and
Fisher, Durrance, and Hinton (2004) focus on immigrants: Burke used Current Population Survey
data to examine library use by recent immigrants, while Fisher et al. report on a qualitative
evaluation study of public-library use by new immigrants in the Queens Borough of New York
City. Both studies indicate that immigrants’ underlying reasons for information seeking are
related to educational goals, hobbies, employment, health information, legal issues, culturalpreservation resources, housing resources, literacy, citizenship, and learning English.
Table 1 summarizes the various reasons for information seeking by underserved
populations and the researchers who identified them.

Information Sources Used by Underserved Groups
Like any other segment of the population, underserved groups have access to various
information sources. Studies by Bishop et al. (1999); Chatman (1990); Metoyer-Duran (1993);
and Warren, Hecht, Jung, Kvasny, & Henderson (2010) have identified the information sources
underserved groups use regularly to satisfy their information needs.
Mass media appears to be an infrequently and intermittently consulted source (Bishop
et al. 1999). Armstrong, Lord, & Zelter (2000) note that very few of their participants –fewer

19

than 10% of the study sample of 99— considered mass media as a useful source to meet
information needs. Where there is a preference for mass media, Chatman (1990) indicated that
the preference results from a lack of informal interpersonal contacts and a distrust of other
informal information sources such as neighbors. In a number of studies, Chatman (1990)
identified “parsimony” or paucity of interpersonal information channels among some
underserved populations (janitors, single mothers, residents of a retirement home). Other
studies by Bishop et al. and Spink and Cole (2001) identified a perception that mass media
(newspapers and television news) often contain negative portrayals or stereotypes of
underserved communities. These studies also revealed, however, that inhabitants share a
communal cultural space that Chatman (1990) defined as a “small world [the inhabitants] … rely
on mass media as an information source on crime and security of the local community (Bishop
et al.; Spink and Cole).
Internet use by members of underserved communities appears to be linked to content
that is popular and readily available. Warren et al. (2010) indicate that underserved populations’
Internet usage reflects a desire for information that adheres to familiar social norms and
internalized communal identities or that portrays them in a positive light. Class-based and ethnic
identities play a significant role in underserved groups’ information seeking on the Internet.
Warren et al. indicate that content on the Internet is not, however, typically inclusive of class or
ethnic identities.
Because the Internet has the potential to engage users not only as consumers but also
as producers or generators of content, it presents an opportunity for underserved groups to
share content that is directly relevant to their life experiences and needs. Gordon, Moore,
Gordon, and Heuertz (2003), however, argue that, as underserved populations begin to use

20

computer resources and technologies, they learn to use them as consumers, not as producers.
Findings from Gordon et al. (2003) and Warren et al. (2010) indicate a cyclical relationship in the
use of the Internet by underserved groups: a lack of content leads to a lack of interest and
inconsistent use of web 2.0 technologies, which in turn can result in a lack of content reflecting
the communal identities of underserved populations. In relation to computer use and
ownership, Bishop et al. (1999) indicate that fewer than a fifth of the participants in their study
had computers at home and that only around half of those had the Internet connections.
Respondents also indicated that, while they might own computers, the machines were often
unusable because they were broken or too old. Thus, Bishop et al. indicate that a difficulty for
some underserved populations lies in their fragmented access to information technology. Such
access can be characterized as scattered, sporadic, and superficial.
A more recent study with findings that echo Bishop et al.’s (1999) comes from D’Elia,
Abbas, Bishop, Jacobs, and Rodger (2007). According to D’Elia et al., Internet access at home for
underserved populations appears to be low; particularly when the highest level of education in a
household is at a high-school level or less. Their research has shown that a smaller percentage of
underserved households have Internet at home than might be expected from an average U.S.
household (D’Elia et al., 2007). This situation could help to explain why Internet use appears to
be the most intensely sought public-library service among underserved populations (D’Elia et al.,
2007; Becker et al., 2010). D’Elia et al. find that a higher percentage of minorities and nonEnglish speakers accessed the Internet at the public library than at home. Thus, public-access
computing provided by the public library may act as a bridging element in the “splintered
information ecology” (Bishop et al., 1999) of underserved populations.

21

Underserved groups often use a variety of information sources to meet their needs and
to bridge splintered information ecologies (Bishop et al., 1999). This phenomenon might best be
explained by Jaeger and Burnett’s (2007) expanded definition of Chatman’s (1990) “small
worlds”: a small world is a “social environment within which individuals live and work, are linked
by a set of common interests and expectations, as well as by a shared set of information needs
and behaviors and often—though not always—by geographic proximity and similar economic
status” (p. 465). Interaction between and information exchange within small worlds is not
always assured for any number of reasons—including prejudice, geographic distance, language
differences, and cultural conflicts. To cross social boundaries and compensate for a paucity of
interpersonal sources, underserved people often turn to an information source that seems
particularly important to underserved groups: the information gatekeeper.
Gatekeepers. The role of gatekeepers in underserved communities has been the subject
of a considerable amount of research. In general, a gatekeeper controls the flow of information
through a communication channel (Rogers, 2003). More specifically, gatekeepers are
intermediaries who move among cultures and consequently are able to link isolated social
networks to one another. In other words, they are members of multiple small worlds and act as
conduits that pass information from one social context to another (Jaeger and Burnett, 2005).
Generally, gatekeepers are defined by characteristics such as higher levels of educational
achievement and higher income levels than those in the small worlds they bridge. Similarly to
other gatekeeping studies such as Allen and Cohen’s (1969) classic work, Agada (1999) also
identifies education as the most significant demographic variable in defining a gatekeeper,
particularly in the context of underserved populations.

22

In a study of an urban underserved community, Agada (1999) explores the personal and
contextual factors that are likely to influence the information needs and behavior of
gatekeepers from a low-income African American community. Agada indicates that the key to
the gatekeepers’ role as information intermediaries is their ability to move among small worlds
and pass information from one context to another. The single most important characteristic of
gatekeepers is their access to network ties and information sources that are generated outside
of the local community and by sources that are not homogeneous with that community. The
gatekeeper provides access points to this information, combining the roles of connected
information intermediary and familiar interpersonal contact. Thus, gatekeepers are able to
introduce information, perspectives, and ideas from other communities in a form that is
accessible as well as compatible with local norms and understandings.
Metoyer-Duran (1993) studied 129 ethno-linguistic gatekeepers in American Indian,
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Latino communities in Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego
Counties in the State of California. These gatekeepers tended to have one or more college
degrees, were multilingual, and were involved with community organizations. The gatekeepers
acted as information facilitators in their respective information environments and tended to be
good managers of information. Their interpersonal networks served as a means through which
information was sought and transferred.
A similar study by Kurtz (1968) focused on the process of the acculturation of Spanishsurnamed rural migrants into urban areas in Denver, Colorado. Kurtz identified networks of
gatekeepers as those who “helped” in the acculturation-and-adjustment process of rural
migrants. The gatekeepers were found to use informal channels to transfer resources to those
in need, though Kurtz does not elaborate on what the informal channels were. The case may be

23

that gatekeepers were simply transferring information from formal sources such as doctors
through informal channels such as interpersonal connections among community members.
General Factors that Influence Information Behaviors of Underserved Populations
According to Taylor (1991), information behavior is the product of the assumptions
made by a defined set of people, the character of usual problems deemed important by that set
of people, the constraints and opportunities of the world in which the set of people exists, and
the assumptions held by the set of people as to what constitutes a resolution to a problem or
what makes information useful. Again, Chatman’s (1990) “small world” theory provides a useful
framework for a discussion of factors that influence the information behavior of underserved
groups. Such factors have been identified in various studies, as displayed in Table 2.
Table 2: General Factors that Influence Information Behaviors of Underserved Populations
Accessibility
Accessibility of information is a predictive
Agada (1999); Chatman
factor of information-resource use. Agada
(1991)
(1999) also notes that inaccessibility of
information resources can act as a reason
for information need. Chatman (1991)
states that the things of most interest are
those that are most accessible.
Awareness
Lack of awareness of information sources
Agada (1999); Chatman
can be limited by a perceived irrelevance
(1996, 1999); Childers
and distrust of information from external
(1975); Bishop et al (1999)
sources. The perceived irrelevance may
extend from perceived incompatibility with
social norms and worldview. Lack of
awareness can result from lack of
cumulative communal knowledge and
incompatibility with established communal
standards.
Education level
Education level can be an influential factor Agada (1999); Sin and Kim
in regard to the use of an information
(2008); Koontz et al. (2009);
source such as the public-library. In a
Berelson (1949)
number of studies, education has been
found to be the significant demographic
variable in determining information-source
use (Sin and Kim, 2008).

24

Experience level

Fatalism

Immediacy of need

Income level

Level of experience within a particular
context provides a degree of knowledge
relating to immediate concerns and
concrete situations. Chatman (1991)
asserts that pragmatism is an attribute
associated with having knowledge based
on experience of a particular situation.
Hersberger (2003) indicates that prior
experience with a situation (e.g.,
homelessness) provides firsthand
knowledge of what information sources to
consult and how to procure basic,
necessary resources when such resources
are scarce. Longevity provides familiarity
with a particular context (social, cultural,
environmental). Knowledge of social norms
and tactics to make sense of situations and
resolve needs extends from experience.
Fatalism is a pervasive belief that ventures
will likely result in failure. A disadvantaged
person who is fatalistic will be resigned to
his or her fate because of a belief that no
personal act will alter life’s trajectory.
Essentially, a fatalistic outlook includes a
resignation to the capricious nature of fate
and a belief that no significant outcome
will result from seeking and accepting new
information.
The intensity of information need
influences
information
behavior.
Pragmatic, short-term, and sometimes
survival needs can drive a need for
convenient, accessible, and pertinent
information sources. The immediacy of
need may also be influenced by a need for
immediate gratification. The need for
instant payoff may contribute to the
principle-of-least-effort
(Zipf,
1949)
approach to information seeking identified
by Agada (1999).
As a demographic variable, income level
can be tied to information-resource use.
There is, however, a strong correlation
between income and education levels.
Studies such as those by Kronus (1973) and
Zwiezig and Dervin (1977) indicate that

socio-economic variables such as income
and occupation appear to be significant
factors because of the correlation between
education and socio-economic status.
Level of diffusion of information is related
to time sensitivity. The more widely
information about employment or
available low-cost housing is diffused the
less valuable the information becomes to
underserved populations. When resources
such as jobs or housing are very limited,
there is an increased amount competition
to attain them.
Literacy and communication skills can be
low as a result of a deficient educational
background. English may be a second
language. Skill acquisition and maintenance
may be difficult because of the splintered
ecology of technological access. Various
literacies can act as enabling resources in
accessing information sources and services.
Perceptions of usefulness are subject to
the situational relevance and benefit of
information provided, association with
information
insider/outsider
status,
information type in relation to source type,
and responsiveness of information
resource to concern or problem
Proximity of an information source has a
significant association with its use or
nonuse. Low-income populations tend to
be more affected by distance than highincome populations. Proximity may also
negatively influence information-source
use because of the immediacy of the
information need and the amount of time
required to travel to a source.
Fear of exposure of personal problems can
outweigh negative consequences of not
seeking information through familiar and
close interpersonal contacts. For example,
when subjects such as domestic violence
and substance abuse are concerned,
participants tend to seek out less familiar,
more formal social outsiders to meet their
information needs.

Situational relevance contributes to which
information and sources will be
determined to be useful. Underserved
populations may avoid or ignore
information or an information source
because they are unable to see its
pertinence to their situations.
The need to verify a piece of information
with a trusted source, typically a source
that is largely homogeneous with the
information seeker, leads underserved
groups to consult members of their small
worlds.
Information regarding employment and
low cost housing can be time-sensitive
because of the limited life span of such a
resource. Time sensitivity of information
will often determine how it is shared.
Usability may be constrained by the utility
of information resources, and services may
be constrained by enabling skills. Usability
may depend on a number of other
variables-such as literacy skills, financial
resources to acquire/afford, availability of
transportation, proximity of information
source, and past failures to use a resource
successfully.
Fatigue resulting from the amount of time
spent at work restricts the use of
information resources, especially in
relation to the usability and relative
proximity of a source.

Chatman (1990)

The information behavior of underserved groups is characterized by situationally
immediate information needs and a social perspective that formal information sources are
community outsiders. According to the small-world model, issues and problems that occupy the
most immediate attention, such as finance and housing needs, are the highest priority
(Metoyer-Duran, 1993). Thus, the information needs of some underserved populations are so
situationally immediate that they are difficult for public libraries to meet easily (Chatman, 1991,

27

Agada 1999). For example, Chatman indicates that in some cases underserved populations
often feel resigned to their present position in life because of a perception that there are no
useful socio-economic information sources available. Underserved people are often convinced
that a long-term effort to improve their own situations is not worth the exertion because a
series of negative events are occurring simultaneously and the coincidence of those events
negates a chance for success (Chatman, 1991).
Chatman expresses the belief that underserved populations tend to perceive minimal
opportunities to improve their own conditions. Underserved groups' perception of a lack of
opportunity is tied to their belief that they do not have access to information sources that might
benefit them. From a contextual level, the world view of underserved populations is partially
influenced by unexpected and frequently occurring problematic situations. Moreover, a fatalistic
approach to life colors a worldview in which failure is often an expected consequence of
endeavors (Chatman, 1991). Chatman explains that the fatalistic approach to life makes the
expectation of failure appear to be a realistic and reasonable perspective. Chatman credits this
sense of fatalism as a reason for a myopic focus on present realities and an orientation toward
immediate gratification.
Agada (1999) notes that a fatalistic orientation to life positions current public-library
services (e.g., educational, recreational) beyond the physical and cognitive reach of underserved
groups. Agada further suggests that, among traditionally underserved communities, there is a
communal lack of awareness about public-library services that may be beneficial to them
(Agada, 1999).
Agada (1999) also contends that the everyday-life problems of underserved
communities are not well served by or even considered in the design of public-library services.

28

Indeed, Dervin and Greenberg (1972) remind us that many contemporary information services
were initially designed for users with high levels of education. For example, many information
systems and services such as databases and even online public access catalogs require skill in
multiple literacies (basic, information, etc.). Even though the intent of the public library may be
to support the uplift of all, the actual design of systems may not reflect this intent.
Furthermore, Agada (1999) notes that the profile of a public-library user is unlike that of
the typical member of a disadvantaged underserved community and that the design and
operation of typical public-library services are not informed by the study of the information
environments of underserved communities (Chatman 1996). The design and implementation of
public services by people with neither an understanding of local problems nor a stake in the
community can lead residents to feel that services were imposed rather than intended to help
(Lupton, 2003). The interaction among cultural factors, such as the perceived outsider status of
public-library services and issues with service provision, can engender a self-reinforcing process
of low use among underserved communities and subsequently low provision of public-library
services to them (Koontz et al., 2009). Indeed, in disadvantaged areas, residents have come to
expect poor quality or outright absence of public services, and this may contribute to low use of
libraries’ services (Lupton, 2003).
In terms of public-access computing and underserved groups, Kinney (2010) finds that
the public library often plays a key role in providing free public access to information and
communication technologies (ICTs). Despite the key role of public-access computing services for
underserved populations, however, Kinney cautions that public-access computing alone does
not and cannot remedy technological and information inequities which have become intensified
over time. Moreover, Kinney contends that public libraries must look beyond the simple

29

provision of information access and work to understand the information behaviors of
underserved communities. An understanding of the small-world context and of factors that
influence underserved groups’ information behaviors is necessary to address information
inequity and to develop effective public-library services.
In other words, in order to understand how the small-world perspective of underserved
groups affects their use of public-library services, public libraries need to recognize the durable
social, economic, and physical processes which perpetuate themselves in underserved settings
(Andersen, 2002). Wilson (2009) observes that the persistence of existential factors and
behaviors across consecutive generations can be linked to the persistence of such factors as
poverty and the inequality of neighborhood environments. Sharkey (2008) terms these transgenerational factors as “intergenerational contextual mobility,” or the “intergenerational
transmission of context.” Essentially, the chances of the children of impoverished parents
remaining in similar circumstances for the rest of their lives is fairly high: Sharkey notes that 7
out of 10 remain in the same or similar circumstance as those into which they were born.
In terms of patterns of public-library use, issues such as an historical lack of publiclibrary service provision to underserved groups, the existence of low-quality public-library
services in underserved communities, and episodic or altogether absent public-library services
and outlets can influence usage patterns. A culture of use/non-use shaped by social norms can
in turn shape continuing social norms. In the case of the public library, the lack of a library in a
neighborhood may influence individual familiarity with and subsequent use of libraries from one
generation to the next.
Wilson (2009) notes that such self-sustaining social behaviors are not impossible to
change. Sampson, Sharkey, and Raudenbush (2008) conclude that the local context of a

30

neighborhood has the potential to alter the developmental trajectories of its residents.
Jargowsky (1997) indicates that, when presented with increased socio-economic opportunity,
people can adopt positive behaviors rather quickly. Moreover, Sharkey (2008) points out that
increased access to economic opportunity and the presence of public institutions have
significant implications for the life chances of individuals. This idea suggests that public-library
services can play an important role in addressing inequity in information access, but only if
those services are designed with an understanding of the small-world information environments
of underserved groups and of the persistence of the transgenerational circumstances in
underserved communities.
Neuman and Celano (2006) go so far as to suggest that, while equalization of publiclibrary resources must be the first priority, in the short run, the balance should be tipped to
favor underserved communities in order to address the durable and cumulative effects of
longitudinal disparity. To redress these effects of longitudinal disparity and to appeal to both the
concerns of a local population and a preference for familiar sources, public-library service
provision appears to require a paradigm shift. Such a shift necessitates revision not only of
traditional public-library services such as reference but also of new types of services, such as
digital literacy training, that can address current and emerging needs.
Public-Library Factors that Influence Use by Underserved Groups
A number of studies have explored the factors that affect the use of the public library by
underserved groups. These studies have generally focused on the ties among the sociodemographic, economic, and geographic factors of a target group and their observed publiclibrary usage. Sin and Kim (2008) used regression analysis to identify 43 influential variables in
order of importance: at the top of the list are educational attainment, income level, household
size, and household proximity to a public library. In a later study, Sin (2011) found factors other

31

than income, such as the quality and type of services offered or the distance to the nearest
branch, to be significant indicators of use. Several researchers (Berelson, 1949; Zweizig &
Dervin, 1977; Sin & Kim, 2008) note that the significance of income level in determining publiclibrary use is probably a result of a strong relationship between level of education and socioeconomic status. Chatman (1986, 1996), Savolainen (1993, 1995), and Agada (1999) confirm
that socio-economic status alone is a limited indicator of information needs and use, as it does
not consider such contextual factors as preference for information sources, attitudes toward
technology, the nature of available services, and cultural factors like language.
Sin and Kim (2008), Agada (1999), Chatman (1986), and Berelson (1949) all indicate that
ethnicity may also act as a determinant of public-library usage. For instance, Sin and Kim (2008)
found that ethnicity is a statistically significant variable in library use. When other variables
(education, income, etc.) were held constant, households whose heads were Native Americans,
Hispanics, Asians, or African Americans were not likely to be library users. Sin and Kim note that
less-advantaged groups such as minorities, recent immigrants, and disabled persons are less
likely to be library users than society as a whole—a consistent finding even when education and
income were held constant. Generally, it is quite apparent that, from a number of perspectives,
underserved groups both were and currently are less likely to be public-library users than other
segments of the population. This conclusion is particularly strong in terms of demographics
(Agada, 1999; Sin and Kim, 2008) and geospatial proximity (Sin and Kim, 2008). A number of
studies that date back to the 1930’s suggest that this disparity has been the case longitudinally.
Overview of Historical and Contemporary Service. Understanding the history of the
public-library and public-library services is necessary to situate the underlying role of publiclibrary service to underserved populations. The public library’s current focus on underserved

32

and disadvantaged communities appears to extend from the social upheaval of the 1960’s. It
was during the 1960’s that library literature truly began to examine library and information
services in light of poverty and social inequality.
During and prior to the 1930’s, the public library generally considered public-service
provision only in regard to the 10% of the population that was white, middle class, economically
stable, and fairly well educated (Casey, 1974). The visibility of underserved groups in society
improved after 1945 with the increase in migration from rural areas to large cities during the
post-Second World War period. Public-library research and public-library services were not
directed toward underserved populations of Americans prior to the 1960’s (Wray, 1976). During
that decade, societal changes resulting from social movements and from such legislation as the
Civil Rights movement and the national War on Poverty signified major shifts in popular views
on equality. The public-library was obliged to shift its focus toward more equal and inclusive
practices just as other social institutions such as government, education, the military, welfare,
private-sector employment and others were (Casey, 1974; Wray, 1976).
Wray (1976) asked: if public libraries were serving only 10% of the U.S. population
during the 1970’s, how could they have served even one-half of that number at their inception?
Indeed, information-studies research focusing on public-library services to disadvantaged
populations does not really appear in the research literature until very end of the 1950’s, and
only then in very subtle ways. Wray asserts that such terms as “minority,” “the poor,” and “the
disadvantaged” do not generally appear in the research literature and for the most part were
not viewed as being professionally appropriate. Yet some earlier library research and reports
from the American Library Association do in fact address and approach the topic of library
service and information provision to different segments of the population. Wray suggested that

33

despite the absence of terms such as “minority” and “disadvantaged” from libraries’
professional discourse prior to the 1960’s, there are indications of earlier calls for more inclusive
policies to encourage universal and equitable provision of public-library services and outlets.
One of the reports published prior to the Second World War, The Geography of Reading
(Wilson, 1938) addresses the inequality that existed in access to public libraries and publiclibrary resources among states and regions in the U.S. He explores the effect that inequality in
public-library resources may have had in relation to the variation in distribution of cultural,
educational, and social institutions and the communication of ideas. In assessing the
accessibility of public-library service, Wilson explores the relationship between the number of
public libraries and service-area coverage in light of population size. Wilson found that at least
one-third of the U.S. population did not have access to libraries. The most consistently
underserved populations were rural residents, minorities, poor people, and those located in
mountainous areas. At the present time, many of the same regions identified as underserved in
Wilson’s study are still underserved by public libraries (Sin, 2011).
In a report published a few years later, Leigh (1950) notes that public-library services
should be “adapted to the variant interests and conditions of different communities” (p. 227).
Leigh also calls for a differentiation in services and proposes that the library should act as the
people’s university by becoming a source of post-primary-school education (Leigh). Yet
suggestions and findings from Berelson (1949) and Leigh appear to have gone largely unheeded.
It is difficult to say whether the lack of action was the result of the prevailing socio-cultural
views of the day, the subtlety with which the findings were presented, their limited distribution
outside the research community, or the fact that such notions were frowned upon
professionally.

34

Casey (1974) and Wray (1976) note that it was not until the 1960’s that there was a real
recognition of the need for change in the provision and focus of public-library services. In 1964
the mandate of the Library Services Act of 1956 was expanded from its focus on rural areas to
include various underserved populations such as people who are handicapped, urban and poor,
older, and illiterate (Orange and Osborne, 2004). Correspondingly, the breadth of research
published in the 1960’s expands to study public-library service in the context of literacy,
children, schools, young adults, minorities, rural areas, and material selection as well as general
services to disadvantaged people and federal legislation and sponsored programs (Copenhaver
& Boelke, 1968). Casey attributes the increase in library outreach efforts to underserved
populations to the social climate of the 1960’s and the increasing societal consciousness about
equitable rights and access to resources and services. The enhanced awareness of injustices
inflicted on minorities was manifested in the enactment of Civil Rights laws as well as in the
federal War on Poverty initiated under President Johnson.
During the 1970’s, researchers continued to explore the provision and role of publiclibrary services in the context of disadvantaged populations. A study from Lipsman looks at the
“social utility” of public libraries and addresses problems associated with public-library services
in low income areas (Lipsman, 1972). Lipsman finds that, among low-income communities with
low levels of education and literacy, public-library use was generally low regardless of publiclibrary service offerings. Interestingly enough, Lipsman notes that the failure of inner-city public
libraries to reach underserved populations could not be traced to one single or small set of
factors and speculates that the confluence of deprivation, callousness, and neglect damaged the
recognition of underserved people’s “human potential” and thus limited or negated the
perception of the relevance to them of the public library. Lipsman also indicates that, where

35

public libraries were successful in reaching low-income communities, their services often
invoked such activities as providing ethnically oriented materials and media. Lipsman’s
recommendations reflect those of Agada (1999) and Chatman (1990 & 1991) in saying that
public-library programs and services should mirror familiar concepts and norms related to user
needs. Similarly, an early study from Chatman (1986), which explored information diffusion
among low-income workers, also finds that information services provided by public libraries did
not generally fit the needs of her subjects.
Current practice-based literature indicates that today’s public libraries are actively trying
to meet the needs of underserved groups. Holt and Holt (2010) identify a number of public
libraries such as the Enoch Pratt Free Library, the Chicago Public Library, and the St. Louis Public
Library that have created services to meet the needs of underserved populations. Put more
simply, the research literature has identified the underlying reasons for information needs
among underserved groups but has not acknowledged the public-library services that fill those
needs. Conversely, the practice-based literature that identifies service provided by individual
public libraries and public-library systems does not comprehensively list the needs identified by
public librarians or the needs that public libraries have created/modified services to fill.
Similar disparities in the picture of library-service provision continue today. Several
studies (Koontz, Jue and Bishop, 2009; Jue et al., 1999; Sin, 2011) indicate that there are
continuing disparities in the provision and quality of public-library services offered to
traditionally underserved populations. Research from Sin, who studied neighborhood disparities
in information access in relation to a variation in funding and service provision across library
systems nationwide, found that lower-quality service levels and fewer offerings are generally
provided to low-income populations. Using data from the Public Library Survey (Chute, A., Kroe,

36

E., O'Shea, P., Craig, T., Freeman, M., Hardesty, L., et al., 2006) and Census Bureau (2000a,
200ob, 200c), Sin analyzed public-library service provision using a combination of Geographic
Information System (GIS) techniques and multiple regression analysis. Sin finds that publiclibrary systems located in lower-income or rural neighborhoods generally receive lower levels of
funding and tend to offer fewer and lower-quality information services than areas with higher
incomes. The study also identifies disparities in the distribution of digital materials, full-time
staff with MLIS degrees, and programs offered to underserved populations. Sin concludes that
insufficient funding hinders public libraries in their efforts to reduce information gaps, bridge
inequities in information access, and generally provide high-quality public-library services to
underserved populations.
Findings from Koontz, Jue, & Bishop (2009) appear to support Sin’s (2011) assertion that
there is a disparity in services that leaves some of the U.S. population underserved. These
researchers performed a nationwide telephone survey, supplemented by a GIS analysis of the
demographic and socio-economic factors of populations in public-library service areas, to
determine the reasons for the closure of public-library branches. They found, first, that the
majority of library closures were due to low usage and, second, that many of the closed facilities
were in areas with low levels of income and education. Thus, it seems that public-library outlets
in areas where underserved populations form the majority of users bear more risk of closure.
In a study similar to Sin’s (2011), Jue et al. (1999) used a GIS software package to
analyze of digital census map data to study public libraries’ provision of technology access to
impoverished people. They find that almost 20% of census tracts with poverty levels of 20% or
higher are not served by a public-library outlet. Only 2% of public-library outlets are located in
extreme areas of poverty. According to Jue et al., an estimated 3 million impoverished

37

Americans are not served by libraries. This conclusion lends some additional strength to Sin’s
(2011)and Koontz et al.’s (2009) findings regarding the imbalance of resources and the locations
of facilities in relation to demographic factors.
The geographic location of public-library outlets can be tied to public-library
management and service planning. Koontz, Jue & Lance (2005) indicate that most public libraries
do not delineate service areas and have little knowledge about the communities residing in the
service areas from which local information needs emerge. Decisions made about public-library
branch location and service planning are not generally informed by an understanding of usage
patterns or of the potential information needs of their service populations. Indeed, as the
following section indicates, public-library service planning materials do not generally mention or
account for underserved populations. Koontz, Jue & Lance’s (2005) findings may be indicative of
public-library policy issues that do not reflect consideration of underserved populations and
their information behaviors.
Public-library Service Planning and Provision. Yet, the literature coming directly from
active practitioners provides several examples of how individual public libraries and publiclibrary systems are planning and structuring services to meet the needs of their underserved
populations. Much of this literature appears to be guidelines and manuals for public-library
service planning, such as the Public Library Association’s (PLA) series on public-library planning
and the International Federation of Library Associations’ (IFLA) guidelines for development.
Although they do not present empirical findings, the PLA’s manuals offer a comprehensive
overview of general public-library services. For example, the Planning for Results manuals
provide information to help public libraries plan and manage service provision proactively rather
than simply reacting to issues or needs encountered.

38

These manuals, however, make no mention of specialized populations such as
minorities, poor people, or immigrants. Consequently, it is pertinent to ask how much public
librarians know about and consider issues in providing services to underserved populations. A
literature search for research on public-library service planning to underserved populations
returned no results. A broader search on public-library service planning returned only a few
results, which are discussed below.
Stephens (1995, 2001, and 2006) surveyed public librarians and published research
studies on the topic of public-library service planning. Stephens (2006) suggested that today’s
public librarians select services as librarians have always done: they read journals; attend
conferences; and use the Public Library Association’s (PLA) planning manuals to design services
based on local patron requests, user surveys, and studies of community demographics.
Stephens (2006) also indicates that her suggestions are conjecture because there is a lack of
literature addressing the issue and consequently an absence of empirical evidence to support
her observations. Through examination of the professional literature, Stephens (2006)
concluded there was no definitive answer on the question of how public librarians plan services.
The apparent lack of a consistent regimen for service planning suggests that service trends are
indeed informed by funding criteria and informal education through conferences and
publications.
A report from Heim and Wallace (1990) titled Adult Services: An Enduring Focus for
Public Libraries found an apparent non-causal link between the services offered by a public
library and the use of the PLA guides. A few empirical studies have also reported on publiclibrary use of the guides. A study by Pungitore (1992), for example, reported on the diffusion
and use of PLA’s 1987 manual Planning and Role Setting for Public Libraries. Results from

39

surveys distributed to many public libraries for this study indicated that approximately 36% (94
of 259) of respondents had adopted the PLA planning process and that another 19% intended to
adopt the process in the near future. Another study by Stephens (1995) found that, of 255
libraries surveyed, 224 had used the PLA manual on Planning and Role Setting and 130 of the
respondents indicated that they had changed their service offerings as a result of consulting the
manual. A later study of 52 Alabama public libraries indicates that some librarians rely on
historical precedent or examples of service offerings of nearby public libraries. For the most
part, public-library service decisions in Alabama were generally influenced by the State’s
standards for public libraries. Around 25% of the sample used PLA’s 1987 planning process; 10%
used the 1998 version of Planning for Results, which provides lists of services that are potentially
useful to underserved populations. One addresses the issue of be an informed citizen by
providing information on public policy; convening meetings to discuss community, national, and
international issues; developing of web resources with links to local, state, and federal
information resources; and providing tax forms and volunteer tax advisors (McLure et al., 1987).
Beyond identification of what resources public libraries use to plan or design their
services, none of the research mentioned specialized populations aside from those with
disabilities. A few books detailing advice and essays on serving poor people are available (e.g.,
Holt and Holt, 2010), yet these do not present empirical findings. No research literature was
found in regard to how public libraries select or plan services for any underserved group. Indeed
Koontz and Jue (2005) indicate that public libraries do not generally delineate different
“markets” or population segments in their local service areas.
Impact of Public-library Services to Underserved Populations. Beyond the libraryservice planning literature, there are a small number of research studies on the assessment,

40

impact, and benefit of public-library services: research from Becker et al. (2010, 2011); Bertot,
McLure, and Jaeger (2008); and Gordon, Moore, & Gordon (2003) focuses on determining such
effects as the impact on or benefit to users of services. These studies are often tied to issues
associated with justifying funding that are beyond the scope of this work. The studies’ focus on
public-library services, however, yield important and useful insights.
Becker et al. (2010) indicate that public-library services are a critical resource for
underserved populations, particularly in the case of public-access computing. In a study of the
impact of public-access computers at public libraries, the authors found that public-library
services make an impact across a number of aspects of life such as employment,
entrepreneurship, health and wellness, managing household finances, and so on. Services
identified by the study include helping underserved populations prepare job applications,
perform job searches, submit employment applications online, undertake employment-oriented
training, make decisions to improve personal health, identify measures to prevail against illness
and to manage treatments, and improve management of financial resources. Becker et al. note
that online public-library services help address a wide range of needs and therefore promote
development of the national workforce, encourage educational achievement among users, and
fill a societal need to deliver health information and provide access to e-government resources.
In a smaller of study of youths from grades 5-12, D’Elia et al. (2007) observe that, in
comparison to other youth, higher percentages of underserved youth use the public-library as
an Internet-access point. D’Elia et al. note that underserved youth whose parents' educational
achievement is at the high-school level or less often used Internet services provided by the
public-library because they generally do not have Internet access at home. They indicate that a

41

benefit of public-library use by underserved youths is the bridging of the digital divide by
underserved people who might otherwise not have Internet access.
In a broad historical sense, the episodic relationship between underserved populations
and the public-library mirrors predominant societal perspectives, economic conditions, and
social movements in the United States. Underserved populations have benefited from the
services provided by public libraries, particularly when those sources meet critical needs such as
job searching and locating housing. The information needs of underserved groups have not
varied much over past decades, and public libraries’ approaches to service provision to meet
those needs have largely corresponded to prevailing service models. Studies have identified
models from the 1960’s (Weibel, 1983) up to the year 2000 (Muddiman et al., 2000). Given the
changes in library practice, technology, available resources, and government policies in evidence
today, there is a clear need to update this information and to identify a current service model
for providing services to underserved groups.
Conceptual Framework
The key issues discussed in the literature above—whether that literature involves
research, practice, or planning—can all be addressed most effectively through the framework
provided by Chatman’s (1990) and Jaeger et al.’s (2010) information model of small information
worlds. The work of these researchers concerning information behavior in relation to
underserved populations as well as Chatman’s work on conceptualizing information poverty in
terms of social constructivist theory have thus provided the primary conceptual framework for
the current study.
Chatman (1990) was the first information-studies researcher to indicate that, in order to
understand the everyday information needs of underserved populations, information-science

42

researchers must account for such populations’ a priori association of information with an
immediate, time-bound reality–a small world. Agada (1999) and Chatman (1999) indicate that
the concept of a small world is especially useful in understanding the information behavior of
underserved groups because a “small world is a society in which mutual opinions and concerns
are reflected by its members, a world in which language and customs bind its participants to a
worldview….In its truest form, a small world is a community of like-minded individuals who
share co-ownership of social reality” (Chatman, 1999, p. 213). Information in a small world is
shaped by the subjective meanings, emotions, and vocabularies that are derived from a shared
social and environmental context.
A small world is one in which common opinions and concerns are shared by community
members. The use of common language and metaphor by a source familiar with the local
context can make unfamiliar concepts easier to understand. Chatman (1999) expands upon the
notion of a small or localized worldview in saying that an individual’s reality is one that is socially
constructed and argues that “when people seek information only from others much like
themselves or are skeptical of claims not personally experienced, their world has a limited range
of possibilities” (ibid., p. 215). Within public-library service areas, different neighborhoods can
represent different small worlds—particularly where there are differences in culture, language,
and socio-economic standings.
Small worlds thus represent information environments in which individuals rely on
familiar interpersonal sources who share a common socially constructed reality, (e.g., friends,
family, and neighbors) and are less comfortable with unfamiliar sources (e.g., physicians,
librarians, and community outsiders). Burnett, Jaeger and Thompson (2008) explain that these
small worlds are the social environments in which individuals live and work. Membership in

43

these social environments binds people together through shared interests, socio-economic
status, information needs and behaviors, and often geographic orientation (Burnett et al., 2008).
Jaeger and Burnett (2005) and Jaeger et al. (2010) expand on Chatman’s model of small
information worlds by demonstrating that the concept can be broadly applied to almost any
social group with a set of common characteristics. The Jaeger et al. expansion of small worlds
into an information worlds model that results in a framework that can be applied to studying
various marginalized and underserved groups. The small information worlds model provides a
conceptual lens through which several themes can be examined: the nature of truth and truth
statements; explanation of action; and the characteristics of the inquirer and respondent,
including their values.

44

Chapter 3 Methods
The literature review and the lens provided by the study’s conceptual framework
suggest the following guiding research questions: What is one model of the current publiclibrary services provided for underserved groups, and what factors underlie the existence of this
model? The specific questions related to this guiding question are as follows:


RQ 1: What services are public libraries currently providing for underserved
groups?



RQ 2: What gaps do librarians perceive that currently exist in service
provision to underserved groups?



RQ 3: What obstacles, besides time and money, do public librarians face in
providing services to the “small information worlds” of underserved groups?

In conducting any research study “it is proper to select that paradigm whose
assumptions are best met by the phenomenon being investigated” (Guba, 1981, p. 76). The
public library is in the unique position of being able to help underserved communities on a
nationwide scale. Because of the inherent interactional nature of the information behavior of
underserved groups within the context of the public-library, the qualitative paradigm was
identified as the most suitable means of exploring and answering the guiding research question
and sub-questions. Qualitative research offers an effective approach for researchers to become
ensconced within the social environment of interest, thus allowing them to develop an
understanding of the interactions of actors from different information worlds.
Qualitative Methods
Three methods in particular make this research approach the most promising for
gathering and analyzing the detailed, context-sensitive information necessary to conceptualize a
current model of public-library services for underserved groups. The use of interviews enables
the researcher to explore practicing librarians’ insights into the nature and details of service

45

provision to underserved populations. Document analysis enables the exploration of potential
issues related to public-library policy, gaps in strategic planning, and the various types of
services currently offered to these groups. Observations regarding service provision to
members of these groups allow the researcher to study the interactions between staff and
patrons and among patrons to identify how patrons use services available and what services
appear to be the most important for underserved groups.
The researcher used all three methods to investigate eight libraries’ levels of awareness
of underserved populations, preparedness to serve them, understanding of issues associated
with them, and practical approaches to serving them. The contextually rich details that resulted
from sustained observation, focused interviews, and careful document analysis for each of these
eight libraries have provided many clues as to whether and how current services and service
models are meeting the needs of underserved groups. Indeed, the rich data provided by these
libraries helped to identify gaps in service coverage and library practice that could serve as the
basis for future work.
Each library in the study was considered a “case”—that is, a single urban public-library
branch providing services to underserved groups. The case study is an ideal form of inquiry to
explore public-library services for underserved groups because the nature of the case study
allows for a longitudinal examination of how services for such groups have evolved over time.
The guiding research question—what is the current model provided for public-library services
for underserved groups?—involves a number of situations which necessitate the use of case
study method in general and the use of interviews, document analysis, and sustained
observation in particular. Researchers in library and information science began using the case

46

study method as early as the 1980’s, when Raya Fidel used the method to investigate
information seeking behavior (Fidel, 1984).
Research Sites. According to the American Library Association (ALA), there are just
under 9,000 individual public-library administrative units and around 7,600 branches in the
United States (American Library Association, 2013). Of those 7,600 branches, 487 are located in
city settings (Swan et al., 2013). The specific criteria for the selection of the public libraries for
inclusion in this study are outlined below.
Criterion 1.The research site had to be a public-library. This criterion reflects the study’s
stated focus on public libraries.
Criterion 2.The library had to be located in an urban area, with a substantial population
of at least one traditionally underserved group (minorities, elderly people, etc.). The
criterion is stipulated because the study focused on public libraries serving underserved
groups within an urban context.
Criterion 3. The library had to be actively providing services to one or more underserved
groups. This is a necessary stipulation, given that the study’s central focus was existing
public-library service to underserved groups within an urban context.
The researcher identified eight branches from two library systems that met the
selection criteria. The branches include libraries from a range of urban areas that vary widely in
size, population density and composition, diversity, and municipal structure. Although not a
representative sample, the eight libraries provide a wide view of the current nature of public
libraries’ services to underserved populations. The libraries serve a range of social groups
ranging from low-income Americans, to Spanish speaking immigrants, to Amish communities in
rural Pennsylvania.

47

Chester County Public Library, Chester County, PA. Two sites were chosen from the
Chester County Public Library system, which serves a county with a median income level that is
one of the highest in the Pennsylvania. It also serves two low-income communities that differ
significantly from the rest of the county. The Chester County Public Library is a federated
system, and the two branches selected are the Oxford Public Library and the Coatesville Area
Public Llibrary. These sites were selected based on discussion with and recommendations by the
Chester County Public Library administration, which identified the locations as underserved
areas within their service area. Each library houses around 50,000 items and has approximately
6-10 computer workstations.
One librarian from each of the sites participated in the study. One was an African
American male in his 50’s, and one was a Caucasian female in her 30’s. Each librarian had over
10 years of experience, one exclusively in public libraries and the other with experience in both
academic and public libraries.
The Free Library of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA. The Free Library of Philadelphia is a
large, centralized, urban public-library system located in the city of Philadelphia. The Free
Library has a long history of service to traditionally underserved groups, particularly African
Americans. Five Philadelphia locations were selected for participation in the study–the Eastwick
Branch, Cobbs Creek Branch, Haddington Branch, Durham Branch, Roxborough Branch and
Lucien E. Blackwell West Area Regional Library. The research sites ranged from the mediumsized West Area Regional library—with around 20 workstations and an additional computer lab,
items numbering in the tens of thousands and five to six librarians—to smaller branch libraries
with around 50,000 items, about six computer stations, and around two librarians.

48

A total of nine librarians from the Free Library participated in the study. The librarians
were aged between 30 and 60 and included Caucasians and African Americans. Five of the
librarians were male, and four were female. These participants had between 5 and 30 years of
experience, mostly in public libraries.
Data Collection. The researcher gained entry into the research sites through both
referrals and direct phone calls. When referrals were not available, direct contact with the
librarian or library administrator in charge of service provision was made via email or phone call.
Once contact had been made with a person who could authorize access to the research site(s),
field visits for observation were scheduled. Following the field observations, interviews were
conducted with participating librarians.
Observations at the pilot site (Camden County, New Jersey) and topics from the relevant
literature provided the baseline from which the researcher developed a basic interview protocol
(Appendix A) that was used in semi-structured interviews at the pilot site. Then, observations
were performed at two site from each of the participating large library systems to provide
additional data about the contemporary day-to-day workings of each public-library system. The
observation and interview protocols used to launch the full study were based on this initial
round of data collection. For the study, librarians, library staff, and library patrons were
observed at each of the seven participating sites. Observations were interactive in the sense
that librarians were questioned about their actions, patron information needs and behavior, and
services available to patrons. The interactive character of the observations encouraged
librarians to provide insights about phenomena being observed.
Expanded field notes and an analysis of relevant documents (e.g., policies, records of
fines, etc.) after the initial observation phase at each site formed the basis for the design of an

49

expanded interview protocol targeted specifically for each site (Appendix A). Each expanded
protocol was geared toward confirming or disconfirming the researcher’s observations and
insights that emerged during fieldwork at a particular site. The main questions in these
interview protocols addressed the general issues that focused the study. Secondary or probing
questions addressed specific sub-issues that arose during the observation phase. All interviews
were recorded and transcribed by the researcher. Observations and interviews were continued
until no new significant findings emerged and saturation was reached.
Document analysis involved the examination of a variety of documents, materials, and
web resources at each site. Items included were library policies; web-based descriptions of
services; displays on tables and in cabinets; lists of approved programs (where available);
resources that met information needs identified from the literature, and educational and
training materials. The date and quality of materials used to provide services were also to be
noted.
Three types of instruments were developed for this study: a general interview protocol
(Appendix A); a targeted interview protocol (Appendix B); and an observation protocol
(Appendix C). The instruments were approved by the Drexel University Institutional Review
Board on September 24, 2013 (Appendices D and E). Permission from the Camden County
Public Library System to conduct the pilot study was received on August 22, 2013 (Appendix F).
The sections of the general interview protocol were drawn directly from the research
questions, which were based on themes that emerged from the literature review. The questions
were refined based on casual observations at a West Philadelphia branch of the Free Library of
Philadelphia, andthe pilot site in Camden County, as well as informal conversations with a
librarian working at the branch.

50

Next, a targeted version of the interview protocol was developed for each case. These
were based upon preliminary observations and informal conversations with the librarians at the
site. The protocols addressed issues that are particularly salient at each branch.
Finally, the observation protocol draws heavily from of Guest, Namey and Mitchell’s
(2012) list of suggested things to observe during participant observation. These include but are
not limited to (1) verbal behavior and interaction, (2) use of library resources, (3) use of personal
and library space, (4) patron movements, (5) and activities of frequent patrons or others who
stand out. Observations conducted at the pilot site were guided by this list.
Data Analysis
The data that were analyzed consisted of interview transcripts, expanded field notes,
and the results of the document analysis. The main approach to analysis involved a detailed
content analysis of the data sources through the use of qualitative analysis software known as
Atlas.ti. Atlas.ti is designed to help researchers perform content analysis as well as to uncover
and systematically analyze complex phenomena hidden in unstructured data. The program
provides tools that allow researchers to locate, code, and annotate findings in primary data
material.
Using Atlas.ti, the researcher first examined the entire data set exhaustively in order to
develop a coding scheme. The scheme was applied to each site, or case, to identify significant
themes, patterns, and issues at the site. A coding scheme derived from concepts found in the
guiding research questions and the interview protocol is displayed in Table 1.

Codes common to individual cases enabled the identification of common themes across
the sites. Codes that were unique to individual cases suggested anomalies and possible
opportunities for additional research. Cross-case synthesis of data from the multiple cases was
used to generate patterns that were applicable to all the research sites and to identify those
findings that were specific to individual sites.
Preliminary patterns describing the nature of public-library service provision to
underserved groups were based initially on concepts identified during the review of the
literature. These patterns included (1) information seeking related to crisis-based or situationally
immediate needs—such as emergency housing, employment, health issues, and legal problems,
and (2) reasons for information seeking and public-library use—such as a desire for information,
a need to develop information and technological literacy, and a desire or need for access to egovernment services. These preliminary patterns were augmented by concepts that emerged
from the cross-case synthesis. Concepts that emerged include a focus on multiple literacies, the

53

critical nature of library technology services to underserved groups, and the current service
gaps.
During the pattern-matching process, data were organized in order to identify current
public-library service practices. For example, current service practices revolve around the
development and support of multiple literacies (i.e., basic, technological, financial health, etc.)
to assist patrons in meeting basic life needs that emerge over the course of life in a “small
world.” Based on the explanatory patterns, a descriptive model of how such public-library
services are provided to underserved groups was developed. Inconsistencies that emerged
during the analysis process were reviewed in order to discover what conditions or issues
explained the discrepancies.

54

Chapter 4: Findings
The findings that emerged from this study fell into the four following categories:
patrons’ needs, service gaps, service offerings, and service obstacles.
Patrons’ Needs
Data collected during this study suggest that the most frequent information needs of
underserved groups revolve around basic life needs, educational support, social issues, health,
and technology literacy. Patron needs often vary by geographic location, and the situation is
complicated by steadily changing neighborhood demographics within many service areas.
Further, the situation on site, in the branches, is rarely simple: patron information needs may
not fall so easily into cleanly defined categories, increasing the challenges of identifying and
meeting them.
Despite the wide variation in patron needs, librarians at participating public libraries
noted that the needs of underserved groups typically centered on some kind of basic life service.
A basic life service is one that addresses a mundane need or task that is essential to working and
thriving in our society. For example, a basic life service might involve helping a renew a driver’s
license, pay a parking ticket, locate a rent-rebate form during tax season, or find a way to print a
document. It might support creating and editing a resume, locating foreign-language resources
for ESL learners, creating and maintaining an email address, or using online banking tools.
Aside from basic life services, educational support was the mostly widely cited need
among underserved groups. Important educational-support services targeted early literacy
needs, basic literacy needs, afterschool programming, study materials for standardized tests,
Internet and technology access for homework assignments, and research and writing skill
development. One-on-one help was a notable educational-support need that emerged during

55

interviews with study participants. One librarian explained the necessity of one-on-one help for
afterschool programs:
Our literacy activities are really … good in that we have people that [provide]
one-on-one help with assignments. So we have four people designated just to help with
homework. Of course … we’ll help with homework assignments, but we have four
people that are designated just for that. … Our afterschool leader [and our teen library
assistants] are necessary to me in that they can sit and say, “Ok, what’s going on with [a
student’s ]math problem [or their] vocabulary?” We are also good from a research
aspect, [for instance when a patron needs] pictures on this [or a] biography on so-andso [we help meet that need]. That’s the part we take on as far as homework help. So
that’s really helped with the community needs. (L-5)
Indeed, the need for educational support among underserved groups extends to whole
communities because it often intersects with basic life needs, as another librarian explained:
Trying to serve all areas of the public and providing them the resources they
need to enhance their education, learn to read, and [access] information to help them
with their everyday needs. Really, [what I do is] guide learning. [I help] the public in
enhancing their learning skills and [promote] life-long learning. We do it through
programs, like story time and author visits … that may help to enhance someone’s
curiosity and education, [their] quality of knowledge and learning skills. (L-8)
Other patron needs are more socially oriented and may involve providing a safe haven
for homeless or mentally ill people during the day or even providing help with information about
recidivism and expungement of prison records. Still other patron needs relate to physical wellbeing and encompass information on the location of food banks, nutrition, and healthy

56

lifestyles. One of the study’s participating librarians explained what comprises the needs of
underserved groups across the age spectrum:
For kid and teen services … most of the key is probably after-school and summer
reading. So we have this LEAP afterschool program that operates four days a week in
the branches that does homework help but also does literacy activities to help support
school-age children’s literacy development. Then the summer reading program tries to
catch all that in the summer.
In terms of adults, obviously we do a lot of reference, a lot of computer
reference. Most of the key for adult services is really reference and triage when
somebody comes in. When somebody comes in and needs to use the computer, we help
them use the computer. If they need to find a book, we help them find that book. If they
need a form, we print out that form. (L-3)
Another librarian gave a slightly different, but complementary, statement regarding
current needs underserved groups:
Every once in a while, we’ll get something unique to the community. But the
majority of the time our help is usually with applications: people are getting credit
checks and people are trying to get their licenses renewed. The basic life services that
we deal with. In many cases, we’ll have job seekers that need to learn life skills, or
they’re trying to create a resume. It’s good we have the resume program on our
computer, but then sometimes we have to teach them how to copy and paste and save
to their flash drive so they can use it on another computer. (L-5)

57

Another participating librarian explained her perceptions of basic literacy as a need
among underserved groups and how those literacy needs intersect with technology-access
needs:
The idea is, and I think this is a general idea, that education or a focus on
literacy itself really isn’t working as it should. So the library has focused more on getting
people access to technology, access to computers, and access to the Internet, or taking
the time out to teach people how to use it. It’s assumed. When we first got computers
in and started increasing the amount of computers in libraries, it was assumed that they
[underserved groups] would know how to use them. Continually, we see people can’t
and only help them as they go along and through.
We, as a society in general, have decided to place everything out there … “Oh,
just go fill out this”… I mean, job wise and even for social programs, “Go fill out the
application online.” Well, how do you do that? Who teaches you how to do that? Where
can they find someone that can help them to be able to do that? Access does not
equate [to] ability or literacy … being able to look at it, use [it] comprehensively. (L-9)
The needs described above require skills that many people in both the general
workforce and in our educational establishment would consider to be quite basic. Indeed, the
ubiquity of information communication technologies (ICT’s) and the ways these tools affect the
performance of everyday tasks suggest a set of new basic literacies rather than one basic
literacy (Buschman, 2009). Reinking (2003) asserts that technologies such as the Internet, email,
hypertext, and mobile communication devices represent a change in the nature of literacy from
a unitary concept, describing one basic literacy, to a multiple one, describing many different

58

literacies. One librarian discussed an example of today’s intersection of basic and advanced
literacy needs:
But, you know, they’re kind of looking for something that they’re going to be
able to print this off and present it as their work sometimes. And, you know, one of the
things that I mentioned before, I think, was to some extent people lose the ability to
synthesize information or pull information from different sources and try to corroborate
what they’re finding and actually dig around and probe and form opinions based on
information that they’re finding as opposed to just finding, you know, one document
from Google and also assessing, you know, is this an authoritative source for your topic
or is this someone sitting on a farm in Iowa somewhere posting something on the
Internet. And a lot times, you know, people won’t even consider the source. (L-1)
The preceding quotation emphasizes both a need for underserved groups to have
consistent access to information services to meet basic life needs and the need for them to
develop the multiple ICT-oriented skills that are increasingly required to use those services
effectively. In short, public librarians face the multifaceted challenge of (1) meeting basic life
needs, (2) supporting basic and advanced literacies, (3) and providing access to technology.
The data collected address the “what” and implied “how” of research question one.
Analysis of that data indicated that the majority of the needs of underserved patrons are related
to basic life services, some form of literacy, and technology access. To meet these needs, public
librarians continually assess patrons’ needs and the amount of assistance that they can offer.
Essentially, librarians work in a dynamic environment, helping as much as they can while
working within constraints set by time, available resources, the complexity and urgency of the
case, and the patron’s disposition. The librarian must constantly reassess an ever-changing

59

confluence of factors. Thus, there is a need to conceive of both the public library and the
library’s service community as dynamic entities in order to have a clear understanding of how
public libraries provide services to underserved groups.
Service Gaps
A number of library service gaps were identified over the course of this study. Many of
the gaps revolve around services for underserved groups as a whole—such as technology gaps—
while others are related to the language needs of new Americans and the needs of librarians for
a deeper understanding of the nature and effects of poverty.
Technology-based Gaps. One of the most notable gaps identified relates directly to
public-library personnel’s inability to support a range of technology-based services, literacies,
and access needs. In general, public-library staff in this study appeared to experience difficulty
when assisting patrons with basic life needs related to technology issues—such as email—and
others related to basic digital literacies. One librarian explained:
I think other staff members might say … digital literacy instruction training
would help. We don’t really have any digital literacy instruction training [available to us].
There’s no one in the library, no professional staff who’s teaching other library workers
how to effectively teach people computer basics or email basics. There are professional
resources, there is some help … We have these early literacy trainings. There is [no]
institutional [training] for teen services or adult services especially around digital
literacy. (L-3)
While training sessions in digital-literacy instruction or advanced technologies do not
appear to be readily available, public-library systems do seem to offer basic training in common
types of software, such as Microsoft Office products:

60

Well … our system offers [some] training for [staff]. I went down [to the central
library], and I wasn’t the most versed in Excel. Never had to use it, but I went to a
beginners’ [class] and an intermediate follow-on [class]. I mean, it wasn’t hard to pick up
once you do it. So they give the basics, so that we’re able to help customers. As far as
training, they offer different trainings. (L-5)
Another librarian expressed similar sentiments, particularly in regard to learning new
software and having insufficient access to new software and training for using it
We closed the libraries down and discussed whether or not we had … what
would help support us with new technologies. As librarians, we don’t have the
opportunity, or the pay, to go back to school [or] to update our resumes [so we can] to
be competitive with the librarians … who are just coming out of school. I’ve already had
11 years here. I’m not utilizing the same skills nor do I have the same training as
someone just coming out of library school. I want that training. I need to have access to
that training. And my job should provide that training to me or at least the opportunity
for it, so that I’m not being passed up for new positions because there is a young person
coming who … has worked with … these emerging technologies for the last two years.
(L-9)
Indeed, public-library systems appear to have recognized the need for technology
training for staff. According to the Chester County Library System’s 2009-2013 Strategic Plan,
“Library customers will be served by staff who can assist them to understand and use emerging
technologies” (2009). Several librarians identified staffing-related issues such as lack of clarity in
regard to which job classification has responsibility for technology assistance to patrons and the
need for an entirely new job classification. Speaking to the first issue, L-5 noted that:

61

I mean, what happens with the library at this point, whatever you personally
know, is what is most helpful to the patrons. Because computers haven’t been
designated to any job class. It wasn’t designated for the LA’s [library assistants] to do; it
wasn’t designated for the librarian to do, but it has to be done because everybody’s
using it. (L-5)
Speaking to the second issue, L-2 and L-5 agreed:
Here we have a computer lab, which is always full. Partly because people need
the training. Not everybody has a computer. That’s another reason that we need to
provide computers. To do that, we need more people. This sounds like a truism; but for
things to work, people are needed. No matter how many machines you have. Machines
cannot operate themselves, nor can they repair themselves. So, implied in that is that
we need sufficient IT [staff], and the public doesn’t see that. You can’t have good
service, you can’t provide good service, unless you have proper maintenance to
maintain the machines. (L-2)
The participating librarians noted service gaps relating both to designating technology
responsibilities to a particular job classification and providing technology training to members of
that classification. In filling that gap, public libraries could have a standardized approach to
technology-literacy assistance and thus improve the quality of service offered to the public.
Moreover, some of the current guesswork in technology-literacy support could be removed by
designating specific public-library personnel to assist patrons with technology. It is thus
apparent that public librarians and public libraries have recognized the need for a direct
approach to addressing technology-based life services, literacies and access.

62

Language-based Gaps. Language-based service gaps include issues with foreignlanguage expertise among staff, with collection development, and with management. Most of
the libraries in the study were in the process of improving their collections to reflect the needs
of new Americans and non-English speakers in their communities; but most libraries had few, if
any, bilingual staff. A librarian explained his situation with Spanish speakers, and conversations
with other librarians serving other language groups were similar:
I feel like we could probably do a better job with our bilingual, or our Spanishspeaking population. I don’t personally speak any Spanish. … I would like to develop our
collection a little more for Spanish-speaking populations, but I need some direction with
that. And it’s kind of hard to get. … We have some staff that speak Spanish, which is
nice, and we have … classes here, but I do definitely think that is something that we
could do a little better, across the board in every library. I know there are libraries …
that have Chinese-speaking [staff]; they’re developing a Chinese collection and Russian
collections to serve the needs of their community, and I think that’s great. (L-11)
As the librarian noted, generally public libraries are providing at least some form of
language services to non-English speakers; however, the consensus among the participants was
that much could be improved. Indeed, analysis of the Free Library of Philadelphia’s and the
Chester County Library System’s strategic plans indicates a renewed awareness of the need to
focus on new Americans that reflects an approach used to serve new Americans in the past:
creating foreign-language collections, teaching English to immigrants, and helping new
Americans assimilate into life in the U.S. through Americanization programs. A related point
emphasizes how language materials seem to be location-specific and how they can become
unnecessary over time:

63

We used to have a Vietnamese collection. It got moved to [another branch],
which I think makes a certain amount of sense. In the past we started [foreignlanguage] collections at branches only to have another branch [manager] come into
[the] branch and say that the collection wasn’t needed. Maybe the branch doesn’t need
those materials anymore; but it struck me maybe as a little bit odd that it was so
location-specific, when most of the rest of our collection practices are moving away
from that. And … well, people are probably going to move in a few years, and you don’t
know what your neighborhood will be like. But I don’t think people are going to stop
immigrating to … [Philadelphia], which is only two hours from New York. (L-4
The librarian made several important points that have implications for public-library
services. First, immigration is an ongoing process that typically happens in waves. Second, a
large number of immigrants may settle in one area of a city for a number of years and then
move to another. Another librarian provided an example of how rapidly the demographics of a
local community may shift:
Oh, my community is and has been changing over from a Caucasian, Italian,
White Anglo-Protestant, or White Anglo-Catholic community into a middle-class, African
American community. And at this point now, we’re seeing [a] declining middle class that
are, like I said, high-school educated. Our Friends group [is composed of] older African
Americans who have been here since the beginning of the change. (L-9)
Overall, it is apparent that public librarians see weaknesses in language-oriented
services but lack staff, policies, and administrative support to address these issues. Languagebased gaps are thus persistentand difficult to address and must be managed longitudinally to
remain current and relevant to the local community.

64

Cultural Literacy Gaps. Meaningful public-library service comes from a deep
understanding of the library’s service community. That understanding can be lacking if those the
library serves are significantly different from the staff serving them. Study participants
mentioned several types of training provided to help staff develop an understanding of the
social, economic, and educational aspects of underserved groups but noted that cultural-literacy
gaps persist:
In terms of the library, I think that we should re-center our work, taking into
account what it means to be underserved and low income. Over the years, there’s been
things like Bridges Out of Poverty training that maybe 10 or 15 librarians have gone to,
when it should be a mandatory training for all librarians. You know, this doesn’t
necessarily apply to me, but I think a lot of librarians grew up middle class, go to college,
go to grad school, remain middle class and then start working with the public. And
they’ve never dealt with anyone who’s low-income and they don’t know how to deal
with poverty and generational poverty. So I think there’s a lot of institutional training
stuff that we could do, particularly with our professional staff, that teaches them to
work better with people who are in generational poverty. (L-3)
Another librarian also discussed a gap centered on differences between patron and staff
cultural perspectives:
Cultural literacy is kind of an issue here. But we do have, like I say, a lot of fairly
diverse people. We have Hispanics, we have African Americans, we have Africans, and
it’s an interesting community. I think cultural literacy is something that we have to work
with … Malcolm X was … I use him as an example for a lot of things. Malcolm, he had
street cred, you know. He would go back out on the street and the people would say,

65

you know, here he gave a talk to them and spoke their language. They talked to him in
their language from the street and he could understand what they were talking about.
(L-10)
Participating librarians also offered suggestions about addressing the cultural-literacy
gap. For example, one librarian explained the benefit of having a staff member who is also a
member of the library’s service community:
The young gentleman who was in here just a few minutes ago, he’s my
executive assistant and he’s very much outgoing. He does a lot of outreach into the
community and he’s very helpful and he’s sort of tuned into what’s going on in the
community. So it’s very helpful to have someone like that, who can facilitate a lot of the
programs that we have, and he gives suggestions about how we can do it. This cat has
been a real outreach person; he’s in touch with what’s going on in this community. He’s
in touch with the younger people who are coming through. (L-10)
Another librarian also expressed the importance of common cultural perspectives and social
familiarity between library staff and patrons:
It has a customer-service effect. I think it’s really important for underserved
groups to have a really consistent [contact person] when they come in the library. Their
experience should be really consistent; someone should be at the front desk whom they
recognize. To say “Hi,” if it’s their first time in, or first time in a while. It’s really great if
the person on the desk can recognize that and help orient them. (L-3)
In general, the public libraries in the study employ non-professional staff and volunteers
from the local communities to address the gaps in cultural literacy that exist in all the libraries
studied. The data directly indicate that this assistance is in place in four of the eight

66

participating libraries and indirectly suggest a similar situation in at least two of the other
libraries. While it is unclear whether such staffing choices were intentional, their ubiquity
suggests that they are an important component in providing services to underserved groups.
The cultural-literacy gap along with the technology-based gaps emerged as the most
commonly shared among the libraries in the study. Every participant noted challenges in regard
to some aspect of technology assistance, such as basic Internet access to technology literacy
support. The language-based gaps were an issue across all eight of the participating libraries, but
the prominence of these gaps varied somewhat in proportion with the number of non-English
speakers within the library’s service area.
Current Service Offerings
Just as the branch librarians in this study were well aware of technology-based,
language-based, and culture-based gaps and identified and implemented solutions where
possible; central library administrations have also identified these issues and the need for
solutions. Both the FLP’s and the CCLS’s strategic plans address these issues and provide
important support for the services for underserved groups that the branch libraries offer. Such
services fall into two categories: short, limited-run programs and the ongoing provision of
information services to meet basic life needs.
Short, Limited-Run Programs. Short, one-time, or limited-run programs generally cover
topics like financial literacy, recidivism, and nutrition. In fact, the use of these programs may be
partly responsible for the lack of longitudinal findings in the literature. One librarian explained
the nature of this approach:
We address issues affecting the community in small doses through short
programs, but nothing long-term … Poverty, obesity, those kinds of things are always

67

addressed through short programs that take no more than about an hour … and those
things are just informational rather than training. (L-9)
Limited-run programs are generally scheduled events that provide the librarian with
defined windows of time to focus on specific issues or topics on an as-needed basis. By hosting
such programs the librarian extends and expands the “teachable moment” beyond individual
reference interviews and can devote time and attention to a particular issue. A librarian
explained the appeal of the “teachable moment” in relation to research skills:
I mean, you can kind of try to, you know, convey to a person, “Go to more than
one source. You need to validate your opinions with concrete facts.” But in the limited
time we’re interacting with people, [it] might be really hard to get to the core issues
there, ‘cause it almost takes kind of a class. You know, you could kind of say that to
somebody; but to really have it sink in and [for patrons to] have a full understanding of
what you’re talking about, you need to spend more time with people and kind of start
from the ground up with that. (L-1)
Another librarian provided an example of this just-in-time approach in relation to issues
affecting the local community:
Recently our library Friends group reached out to us and wanted to hold a
program that was offered by the city government … that benefits neighborhoods …
about all of the resources that our city has. Their phone numbers, what the agencies do
specifically … how do you go about addressing issues in your community—crime, blight,
[and] even just regular services? That’s one of the things that our library is addressing at
this point. (L-9)

68

The basic premise behind the use of the short program involves drawing on existing
resources or those close at hand to address emergent community issues through practical
means. Some particularly successful or popular programs often involve partnerships with
universities, library Friends groups, local community organizations, community recreation
centers, and city agencies. One participant recalled how such a program was useful for both
children and parents who are members of an underserved group:
Well, we’re not doing … [programs] in a sense … [to directly address] childhood
obesity. We used to have some programs coming out of Penn State. There are people
that would come in and would do programs. One in particular was coming in from Penn
State, where she’d do the nutrition thing and show them how they could fix snacks,
healthy snacks … In fact, they did a program for adults that showed them how to eat
healthier. We figured it was a good program, and [it] showed kids how to eat [and]
make their own snacks. (L-6)
Another librarian described a number of successful programs offered in collaboration
with several organizations:
This library is in the process of partnering with [a] nursing school to present a
series of health programs. But, in any event, that’s [just] one place that we’re partnering
with. I partnered with [a business development organization], which had some business
programs here. That was actually year before last. Last year we didn’t do a lot of
programming because [we] didn’t have staffing to support it. (L-1)
Programs focusing on health and business appear to be the most frequent short-run
offerings covering such topics as healthy eating, consistent exercise, understanding health issues
associated with poor diet, starting a small business, and entrepreneurship. Other programs

69

have focused on other aspects of literacy—such as use of e-government services, resume
development, GED preparation, legal advice, taxes, and expunging criminal records:
I mean, there’s a lot of things that we’re involved in, just to meet … the needs of
the community. So I think each library takes on a different face, even though we are all
working on the same general goals. So what’s needed here might not be what’s needed
in a Northeast library, and what’s needed there isn’t necessarily what’s needed in a
West Philly or Southwest Philly library. (L-5)
Participating librarians recognize the importance of offering programs that meet the
needs of particular neighborhoods. Although all the libraries in the study offer programs that
focus on some form of literacy, each library appears to have a context-sensitive twist. A public
librarian mirrored the comments of many of this study’s participants when he described a
strategy for providing literacy services to his community, which is heavily populated by
underserved groups:
Early-literacy programming, so story times, after-school literacy support,
homework help. And then digital-literacy programs … helping people use the computer
more effectively. So that can be in the guise of signing up for an email address, or it
could be something more advanced, like composing a resume. … It’s like a resume
workshop or an email one-on-one workshop. (L-3)
Several of the study participants shared the view that certain portions of their service
communities were disenfranchised and/or marginalized in various ways, and they focused on
ways to address those needs. One librarian was very enthusiastic about leveraging library
resources and partnerships with local professionals and organizations in order to empower
members of the local community. That librarian seeks partnerships and resources that aid

70

individuals in transitioning back to society after incarceration. His efforts have included hosting a
series of legal lectures; providing story times meant to help with children cope with incarcerated
relatives; and providing space in his library for the only local unemployment agency (which had
recently lost its office space). The librarian explained how helping patrons expunge their criminal
records can support their reentry into society:
For example, a person came in to talk about expungements of people’s criminal
records. Well, in this community, I would say that is something that many people
probably experience. You know, just because of the type of community that it is and the
type of people who are here. Which is not that unusual for a lot of communities. But to
help to look at [social] reentry, how to get from the prison pipeline back into the social
pipeline, and jobs and things like that, we brought in a person who’s an attorney that
talked about expungements. (L-10)
He explained further why this program is important to the families in his service area,
particularly children:
We have to get into their mind in a way that will make [the consequences of
incarceration] important to them, you know, like [everyone in the community]. There’s
a prison down the road here, and I think … the young people don’t realize what their
impact is [when they go] in there. … We’re going to get into doing a discussion [with
families] … on a children’s book [about someone being arrested and taken to prison].
You know, all the stuff that’s going on there; and I think it’s a valuable resource for a
community like this. But we have to find a way. I wouldn’t necessarily grab third graders
and second graders and what not and sit them down and discuss this book. I’d rather
discuss it first with parents.

See, but these are the lives that they live here. … So we need to wake up. And
when people end up going into that system, they don’t realize what impact it has on
their families. “You know, I broke in this place and I had to get whatever I got out of it
that was for me.” You know, family has to go visit you there, you know, which is not a
fun experience that they go through … [families] have to figure out what are they going
to do, how they’re going to survive while you’re there. All those kinds of things that
people need to wake up to.
So this is what I see as all the challenges that we deal with. And it’s having
resources … that are available through our library system, I think are very valuable. We
got to get [the long-term implications] into people’s face so that they know and they get
[an understanding of the wider consequences of their actions] behind their eyes, so that
they can actually hear and understand what this is about for them to understand
incarceration as well as issues that result from someone being incarcerated. (L-10)
Clearly, library programs related to issues affecting individuals such as incarceration also
deal with communal issues that contribute to larger problems such as poverty, marginalization,
social exclusion, and equality of access. Librarians are excellent at providing educational and
informational programs that increase their patrons’ awareness of specific issues that underlie
these broader problems, and they need to be connected to the communities in their service
area in order to meet the needs of underserved people who live there. As one librarian
explained:
You know what it is, I think if we’re going to be in a community we have to be
involved with the community, all the things the community does. Someone who’s just
gotten out from being incarcerated and they have children, and they need a place that

72

they can go, need a place … for those who may have a computer but can’t afford
Internet access. Because no matter what’s said and done, that’s the most expensive
thing. A lot of people get computers, they get laptops and stuff, but they can’t get
Internet access, because that’s expensive. (L-7)
While the example of incarceration does not apply to every underserved group, it
emerged as a consistent theme across neighborhoods, service areas, and library systems in the
study. Further, it serves as an example of a context-specific short-run program. It is these shortrun programs that allow librarians to create “teachable moments” targeted toward addressing
emerging community needs. The episodic nature of public-library programming for such issues
may shed some light on the lack of any longitudinal literature findings and reinforce the
perception that library services have been episodic.
Ongoing Provision of Services. While short, limited-run programs targeted to specific
needs have an important role in serving underserved communities, participating librarians also
recognize the importance of providing regular, ongoing services to meet the basic life needs of
underserved groups. Such services consist of brief, individualized one-on-one interactions that
meet patrons’ everyday needs. In each of the libraries in the study, librarians identified
educational support in one form or another is one type of service that is the most applicable to
the core needs of underserved groups, regardless of age:
In my community, yes, [the] core set of needs [are] after school, [technology]
access, … [and] education support for schools. Our local schools do not have libraries,
do not have librarians, nor do teachers have the opportunity and time to teach children
how to do research. They are expected to, through what seems like osmosis, to be able
to do these things, without being taught how. So, you know, we reach out to schools by

73

school visits, teacher visits, and discussion, you know, to support teachers to fulfill their
requirements and for children to be able to do their assignments. (L-9)
The participating librarians emphasized the need to focus on these basic educationalsupport services as a way to encourage the development of underserved groups’ advanced
skills:
I view it as providing tools, and we will show you how to use the tools. So let’s
say you’re building a deck or something. Here’s the nails, here’s the right-size board,
here are all the tools you need. And I can give you an idea of how to do it. (L-2)
Participants noted that students in underserved groups, at various educational levels,
were almost completely unfamiliar with how to perform basic research. Assisting them with
source citation and synthesizing information from multiple sources provides librarians with a
way to support their development of rather advanced information skills:
A lot of my students that I work with at the high school don’t know anything at
all about an almanac or an atlas. A lot of the students … [are] not familiar with an
almanac, they’re not familiar with an atlas, they do not know how to use an index in a
book, they don’t know what a bibliography is. So how can you do research without that
knowledge? [The only thing] they’re familiar with in research is “Google it” or [use]
Yahoo, type it, and then they want the computer to do it for them. So, really, they don’t
have the research skills... In some of the classes, I teach them the basics of research; and
without me providing that information, they don’t get it. (L-8)
Another librarian provided an example of an interaction with a middle-school student
from an underserved group that applies to others in the student’s situation as well:

74

So along with us helping, we are a place where kids can learn how to surf the
Internet if they need to look for material. [As well as] how they can learn … to find
authoritative and authentic material to use. Just because websites are coming up first
don’t mean that that’s the best site for you to get your information from. (L-7)
Plagiarism, citation creation, and synthesizing information are important higher-level
skills which serve as basic inputs for post-secondary education and skilled employment. As L-7
explained, underserved groups bring advanced literacy issues ranging from plagiarism to
formatting:
And I tell them, I say “Hey, ok … [you can get away with plagiarism in]
elementary school, middle school, some high schools, but when you get to college
forget that.” [People will] say “Ya, you stole it from there, you stole it from there.”
There’s no way you can write anything that people expressed and not plagiarize
because, you heard it from somewhere. You may not be able to remember where you
heard it from; but when you type and write it down, it came from somewhere. You need
to make sure, and that’s what we trying to tell them.
[I have also said to them] … “Now you and I both know what you’re doing [by
using such a large font] don’t we? … Now it might be, because you want to it [fill up the
page], but if you see it … [standard size font], it’s a very small paragraph.” ... But [those
are the things that] you want to start impressing on them. [Emphasize] that it’s
important for them. That you can’t cut and paste … say it’s yours. [I have said many
times] “You don’t even know how to clean it up, because one can see you cut and
pasted, because the font that they use is different than the font that you’re using.” (L-7)

75

Librarians attributed patrons’ lack of research skills to a number of different factors,
including the lack of school libraries and of early and regular interaction with school librarians;
differences in how students used to locate information in past decades and how they do so now
(encyclopedias versus Google); lack of time and resources on the part of teachers; and schools
focusing on preparing students to pass standardized tests. One librarian provided some
additional insight:
People come in and say I’m looking for information on such and such. And
sometimes you say, “Well, we have a great book on this.” [Then] they say, “Well, can’t
you just print something off the computer?” And they think that with just a few taps,
they get everything presented for them right there. I mean, I don’t think plagiarism …
even enter[s] their mind. But, you know, they’re kind of looking for something that
they’re going to be able to print this off and present it as their work sometimes.
One of the things that I mentioned before, I think, was that to some extent
people lose the ability to synthesize information or pull information from different
sources and try to corroborate what they’re finding and actually dig around … also
assessing [whether it is from an] authoritative source … a lot [of] times, people won’t
even consider the source. (L-1)
As the librarian suggested, another important part of the continuing provision of
services in underserved communities revolves around the intersection of education and
technology. Study participants noted that educational support is often paired with technology
access and instruction in the use of that technology in an effective and responsible manner.
Interestingly, public librarians appear to couple services such as educational support and
technology access or technology literacy with literacy instruction.

76

In light of the central place of technology in information access and in meeting everyday
needs, almost every librarian in the study viewed providing technology-based assistance as the
most important ongoing service for underserved groups. One librarian explained:
Well, definitely computers. Because a lot of low-income people still don’t have
access to computers. They are looking for employment, [and] a lot of employers require
that resumes and all correspondence be done … online. … I think all of our services [are
applicable to the needs of underserved patrons], but the computers are probably the
biggest. I guess here and there you might see a discrepancy in terms of who … [has]
access and who doesn’t. (L-1)
The need for basic access to technology by underserved groups emerged over and over
throughout the study. Based on information from the literature review, principally the work of
Becker et al. (2010), the need for basic technology access was expected. However, both the
extent and thedepth of the basic needs exceeded even the expectations of the researcher. One
librarian explained part of the ubiquity of this response:
I mean, a lot of these people don’t have computers, either. … I don’t think there
are that many Internet cafes with their own computers. I guess people could go to
Kinkos or something like that and pay by the minute. I don’t think that would really work
for job searching, because you’d be paying so much every day in order to [search and
apply for jobs.] [Otherwise] I don’t know what they would do. (L-4)
Today there is a significant focus on information services, digital resources, and
information communication technologies and their usage. Something that runs parallel to the
basic need for ICT access is both awareness of and participation in the information society. The
level of involvement in the information society that is possible for underserved groups is

77

inherently limited by what Bishop et al. (1999) call their shattered information ecology. A
shattered information ecology can be defined by limited or poor access to ICT’s and low levels of
competency in their use. Moreover the lack of ITC literacy can put an extra demand on already
stretched resources. A librarian explained that the information received by underserved groups
can be incomplete, possibly flawed, or even misleading:
We have a lot of people that don’t have jobs that are learning that, in order to
apply, you have to have an email address first. And so there will be people online, filling
out the application, and they get 30 minutes and we continually extend people’s time
on the computer if there aren’t people waiting because we know that we have people
that aren’t as savvy or don’t know as much about the computers … so we’ll have to give
them another 30 minutes so they can apply for an email address and then they can go
back and put that email address into the application. So then, they have to write down
the user name, write down the password—because you’re not going to remember it …
(L-5)
Having an email address in the present time is almost akin to possession of a street
address and a phone number 20 or 30 years ago. Digitally speaking, not having an email address
is almost like being digitally homeless. By that same line of reasoning, some aspects of what
Childers (1975) referred to as information poverty reflect actual poverty. In a more concrete
sense, possession of personal information assets often corresponds to a person’s economic
resources. Another librarian explained:
A lot of people get computers. They get laptops and stuff, but they can’t get
Internet access, because that’s expensive. So, they have to come here for it. They have
to come here so they can go online in order to put in for jobs … Maybe they don’t [have

78

a computer] … maybe they have a computer, but they don’t have Microsoft Word or
access to printers to print off. Everybody does not have a computer and those who do
have a computer do not have Microsoft on it so they can at least type in Word. (L-7)
The need for basic technology skills ties any discussion of public-library services for
underserved groups to the development of literacies—and in the case of technology, multiple
literacies which build upon one another. L-7 provided some additional clarification:
They need to learn more about making sure they get USB drives to save stuff. If
you’re starting to type and you’re typing a paper, … I say you need to … save your work.
And that’s saying it not for our sake [but because] … it allows you to save what you’ve
typed. And next time you write a paper you can look at what you’ve written before. So,
like I said, it’s not only a way of saving information, it’s a way of … looking and seeing
how far you’ve come. I mean, the lights could go out, the stuff is gone, unlike, you know,
where you might have your own personal computer and … it will at least save it
somewhere so that when it comes back on, at least it’s there, where you can retrieve it.
(L-7)
In addition to being both a technology-access point and a place to receive informal
technology literacy training, many public libraries also provides formal technology training.
Beyond limited-run programs, however, there is little in the way of formal or organized
technology training offered by the public libraries in their study. One librarian described the
situation in her branch’s computer lab:
Well, we have the computer lab, which is heavily used. We have a lot of people
that are looking for work, so they come in and they and get help, one-on-one help with
crafting resumes and posting them, looking online for jobs. … If we had more computers

79

in the lab, we only have 6 … it’s a small room. You know, a room like this, it still wouldn’t
be enough. ‘Cause I mean it’s free, you know, computer classes. (L-1)
The computer training lab in L-1’s library provides an excellent example of the type of
facility that was cited by a number of librarians as being a key place where underserved groups
could receive focused technology training and assistance for advanced technology-based tasks.
Another librarian explained:
Here we have a computer lab, which is always full, partly because people need
the training. Not everybody has a computer. That’s another reason that we need to
provide computers. If somebody doesn’t know how to use a computer properly, should
they be punished for that? To me they should be encouraged to do well. They should be
encouraged to learn computers. The computer lab we have is not run by the library; it’s
run by another city agency, which happens to have labs in the libraries. So we need to
encourage that in my view. (L-6)
Essentially, there is a real and substantive need for computer-literacy training among
underserved groups. An example of the popularity and need for the lab is the wait-line that
typically precedes every scheduled session. Several librarians echoed L-6 in discussing
technology access:
I mean, in terms of digital literacies … if I had a computer lab, I would run a
computer basics class every single day of the week. And still have people ask the next
week, “When’s your next class? I need that class.” So, you know, I can’t promise that all
my seats will always be filled, ‘cause low-income people have pretty chaotic lives. And
like, you know, you might run a digital literacy class five days in a row and have no-one
show up; but the next week someone’s going to come in who has never used a

80

computer before, [and] their Social Security counselor or whoever has said, “Go fill this
out online.” And they really have to do it. So, you know, in terms of getting people …
using the Internet, and using it effectively for stuff like healthcare management, civic
engagement, banking, billing, that kind of stuff, it’s hard to meet the need because we
don’t have that many computers ... (L-3)
L-3 provided further explanation of the FLP’s current approach to providing such services:
So, you know, the hotspots were meant to put digital resources so, computer
labs … in a community institution like a school or a church or a community service
organization and then with this grant funding also have instructors there who would do
a lot of digital literacy instruction, lots of one-on-one computer-buddy kind of help as
well as … small classes. (L-3)
The provision of computer labs that offer computer classes is an important, but not
abundant, feature of public-library services for underserved groups. Some public libraries
appear to be gradually expanding their provision of technology literacy and technology access;
however, there is a need to accelerate the expansion of these services to other public-library
locations:
I mean … increasingly… government services, employers, [and] businesses [are
doing everything online]. And … it’s not something that [underserved] people are
terribly familiar with. And it seems to be presumed to be common knowledge. There are
enough necessary things in most people’s live that require interaction with … this online
world and with computers as a technology. (L-4)

81

In many cases, provision of computer labs and technology literacy courses was
mentioned in relation to regular staff members who are able to provide dedicated technology
support—which is also applicable to the needs New Americans, as one librarian explained:
[New Americans] … sometimes come in for help using technology to access …
jobs or government agencies and different things they provide. [Common needs are]
immigration forms or tax forms or finding death certificates and [using] Careerlink,
[applying for] unemployment, things like that. [Our] career development services range
from help with job searching, filling out online job applications, [test preparation]
booklets. (L-4)
The librarians in the study have found that some services, mainly educational and
technological ones, are best provided in an ongoing manner when addressing information needs
of underserved people, while other emergent needs are better addressed through the use of
limited short-run programs. Indeed, the more generalized and basic services that address the
basic life needs of underserved groups appear to constitute the more persistent service
offerings. This division in service types illustrates the core of strategies that librarians use on a
daily basis to assist patrons.
Service Obstacles. Analysis of the study’s data revealed three predominant types of obstacles to
providing effective services for underserved groups: shortages in staffing, lack of local
autonomy, and issues with communication.
Staff Shortages. The primary obstacle in providing services to underserved groups
involves low staffing levels. Staffing shortages have a direct impact on service provision, as
noted by several participating librarians:

82

So, at the Free Library, we’ve suffered a lot of contraction in the last 6 years.
And the two places where it has mostly hit [are] staff and materials. The materials
budget has been restored at the state level. … And then the other [issue] … is staff. … I
see that, as people retire, they’re not replaced, if someone moves to a different city, no
one’s rehired to replace them. There’s just a lot of attrition overall in terms of staff
positions. (L-3)
Similarly, L-5 noted that “Our ability for outreach is limited both when one of the other
librarians is having a program and when there’s only one librarian scheduled.”
Participant L-6 echoed that view:
One issue is that it’s very hard to do a program in the back [in the story-telling
room] and only have one person on the floor. Because [we need two on the floor] for
adequate coverage. It’s too hectic. So we’ve shorted our programming]. … We kind of
balance that off by assisting each other wherever you need to be assisted. ‘Cause [every
department is short]. Then there are times when everybody’s thin, even though we’re
short, but if need be we’ll pull somebody from Adult/Teen. That allows us to do an
outreach. It’s a lot less [likely that we can go] than it would be, let’s say, if we had 3
[professional staff]. (L-6)
Staffing shortages also affect service provision in unanticipated ways:
I think a number of staff are not terribly comfortable with opening [the library]
without a guard. Ideally, were the staffing situation different, it would be great to be
open more often and always have an extra set of eyes that is focused on the task of
keeping the building secure rather than [a set] that is working on typing something or
helping somebody find a book and not keeping an eye on what patrons are doing. … It

83

does mean that certain things can’t happen as easily and that there are other things that
are on people’s minds, rather than serving the community. (L-5)
Of course, public-library staff must create a safe and controlled environment for both
staff and patrons. When they cannot count on guards to assist them, service provision can be
easily disrupted:
The library can be a haven for … the disenfranchised or homeless or mentally ill,
because it’s a comfortable setting to be in … people wander in who haven’t taken their
medication and who have outbursts. … Last week, in fact, a woman, she got upset with
me, she thought I was talking about her. Then, the next minute, she accused somebody
else of looking at her … then she got really highly agitated at that point and she had to
be taken out. … People often wonder why … you need the security guards in the library.
There is definitely a need. In fact, ideally it would be great to have two, because [a
guard can be] on lunch, or off a particular day, or out of the building. (L-1)
Issues with staff shortages proved time and again to be the most frequently identified
obstacle to the provision of services to underserved groups. Moreover, shortages complicate
and exacerbate already existing problems. Generally, public-library policy requires that there be
a minimum number of staff present before a branch or building can open to the public. Safety
and security are concerns for both patrons and staff, and service provision can suffer when staff
shortages force librarians to focus on safety issues.
Lack of Autonomy. Another obstacle to effective provision of services to underserved
groups is the lack of autonomy available to neighborhood branch librarians:
So … the people that order the books for us at the main library don’t have [an] …
observation of what we need. … In the past I would have opportunity to work with a

84

vendor, but I don’t have that opportunity anymore. It’s all centralized. I don’t know how
they communicate with the vendors, if there’s restrictions or not. (L-8)
Participating librarians expressed the concern that they are increasingly being cut out of
the loop in regard to decisions made about collection development:
We used to actually go down to the main library and physically get to handle the
book and look at it. Now it’s all online. And when we had more staff, I would actually,
before each order, you know, kind of go through the stacks. Literally to see how many
books we have on a particular topic. (L-1)
Librarians have limited time and independence in which to make collection decisions.
Most of the study participants seemed to desire more decentralization in regard to their
materials selection practices.
Communication Issues. Problems with a centralized communication structure are
exacerbated by poor internal and external communication, since organizational communications
are intimately tied to the level of administrative centralization in a public-library as well as to the
degree of flexibility afforded to neighborhood branches. One librarian discussed how a
centralized communication structure can inhibit external partnerships with non-library
organizations:
At one time … materials management [would receive summer reading lists from
schools]. And they would buy some of the books in advance [because] they talk to [the
schools] a lot. I mean, they have the connection [with the schools]. … In past we did
many, many more outreaches than we do now. … Some schools … had a school librarian
who … could open up the door for you, [but not many schools have librarians anymore].
… So now you have to go through talking … and getting to know people more and for

85

them [to be] willing to, like, help you get inside. [What happens, is when you get to
know someone] … know very well, [they] transfer … and now you have a new group [at
the school] and now you have to go through the whole process again, and that takes
time. [L-6]
Another librarian mirrored L-6’s comments:
I think the main obstacle is just communicating with the organizations. It’s just
difficult sometimes in getting contact with someone at an organization to set up times
and dates of when they can come to a library or when I could visit somebody. (L-8)
While communication with external organizations such as schools was identified as a
challenge, trouble with internal communication also emerged as an element. One librarian
discussed how poor internal communications can result in administrative decisions that are not
informed by feedback from librarians in underserved areas:
Well, there’s this great resource [called] Black Biography, which everybody
used. And it was decided that we would only have digital access. Then it was decided we
have no access at all. So, once again, there’s too much top-down decision making [and]
not enough decision making at our level. What’s good for one branch is not good for
another. What’s good for one area of the city is not good for another. But to me if …
they say we’re neighborhood libraries now, then we need to pay attention to the word
“neighborhood.” And I think that hurts our service. A certain segment, the more digitally
literate segment, benefits. But this is a system, in my view, for the entire city, not just
certain segments of the city. (L-2)
Another issue that is intimately tied to communication involves the types of statistics
that public libraries record in order to document usage of different resources. These statistics

86

are used to communicate with library administration, which in turn uses the statistics to
understand what is going on in branches. The trouble is that the statistics collected might not
effectively represent the types of use in libraries serving underserved groups:
They have a turnstile count, where … each time someone comes that’s counted.
Of course, that doesn’t reflect the actual usage. Now, I believe there’s a way that we can
do that, but it’s very labor intensive to count, say, the books on the desk. It’s not just a
matter of a staff person going around counting … you have to take the book, and I think
it has to be scanned, and then there’s somewhere that can be recorded. But … if my
understanding is correct about that, it’s not very practical. … Once again … [staff] just
don’t have the time to take each book … to go into that section of the computer, scan it.
So it would certainly be better if everything that people used during the day was
counted. But right now … with the system in place for that, it’s just not really feasible.
(L-1)
Commonly collected statistics, such as circulation counts, do not accurately capture the
types of library-resource usage common to underserved groups. Librarian observations confirm
such a situation:
Unfortunately, the areas that need the libraries the most often have the lowest
circulation figures because people check out materials and then they’re overdue and so
then they have a fine and then they can’t afford the fine. So they won’t check out any
more materials. So they may have a lot of in-house use, but that’s not reflected in the
circulation counts, because it’s not actually leaving the library because people aren’t
checking it out.

87

Another librarian confirmed the need for in-house usage counts to capture information
about resource use by underserved groups:
I often feel that we are collecting statistics that don’t measure need [or that]
measure specific kinds of use [and] that we use those to justify our budget as part of a
government agency. As a result, some things that are quite important that libraries do
for underserved populations are left fiscally unjustified and suffer as a result. … I just
think there are a lot of statistics we can generate with things that might get used a lot
by people but not checked out. But I also I think that some of the statistics we collect
show that people are using certain things and doing certain things, but they don’t
necessarily fit too largely into the educational or enlightening or cultural resource role
of the library. (L-5)
In general, the types of statistics collected and the difficulty of collecting them can risk
leaving very useful services invisible and therefore unjustified in the eyes of central
adminstrations.
Summary of Findings
1. Patrons’ needs: In general, the public-library services provided for underserved groups
are the same basic services that are provided for all patrons. These general services,
however, are often leveraged for underserved groups to focus primarily on literacybased needs. The services offered vary by location, available resources, and observed
needs. However, the services generally include basic technology literacies, basic literacy,
school-support services such as researching and development of bibliographies, and
literacies that support employment and basic life needs. The services that support

88

employment and basic life needs include job searching, guidance in the use of egovernment resources, and online finances.
2. Service gaps: Gaps in public library services for underserved groups revolve primarily
around issues associated with technology, language, and staff. In regard to technology,
there is a distinct and even urgent need for technology-based literacy support or a
stronger focus promoting technological literacies. Across every library and librarian
included in the study, technology assistance, literacy, and support were identified as the
most pressing needs that public libraries consistently have trouble meeting. Another set
of user needs that public libraries have trouble meeting is language based. These needs
for bilingual staff and for ESL materials for African and Middle Eastern languages. The
third gap, staff cultural literacy, emerged a number of times over the study. Several
librarians noted the need for mandatory training on subjects such as poverty, diversity,
and non-Western cultures for all library staff working with underserved groups.
3. Service offerings: By and large, public library services for underserved groups fall into
two broad categories: short-run, limited programs and the ongoing provision of services
to meet basic life needs. The short-run programs typically address issues observed to be
affecting those in the local service area. Ongoing provision of services deals with chronic
needs associated with multiple literacies, information and technology access,
pervasiveness of negotiating difficulties with ITC’s, and education support. Both types
of service revolve around everyday life issues such as filling out applications, personal
health, financial management, legal issues, and research skills.
4. Service obstacles: The ability of libraries to target a service to a specific sub-population
is largely dependent on the availability of staff, time, resources and technology; the

89

efficacy of communication; and level of local autonomy. Perhaps the most significant
current obstacle is chronic shrinkages in staffing. Every aspect of public-library service in
the libraries in this study had been affected by staff shortages, from daily operation of a
service outlet to assistance with homework and job searching. Another obstacle is an
inability on the part of branch librarians to address emerging patron needs quickly
because of a centralized administrative structure. Further, the types of usage statistics
currently collected do not capture the types of resource usage in which underserved
groups often engage. As a result, services favored by underserved groups are often left
fiscally unjustified. An additional obstacle related to administrative centralization is poor
internal communication. Communication challenges that emerge in the data include a
lack of responsiveness from higher administration and a focus on top-down decision
making with little provision for bottom-up feedback. These factors lead to difficulty in
maintaining communication with external partners, such as schools.

Chapter 5: Service Model
Public-library Practice Model: Information & Literacy Triage
The framework of this study consists of several key components. The first is a historically
informed, longitudinal perspective on service provision in general and on public library services
to underserved groups in particular found in studies and publications from the last 50 years. The
second component is based on the work of Elfreda Chatman and her conception of underserved
populations and small information worlds. The third component is comprised of
characterizations of older models and the driving forces of ALA standards, library literature and
research, and funding. All three components underlie the current model of service provision to
underserved groups and suggest the characterization of that model as what might be called
“information and literacy triage.”
The results of this study suggest that the current model of public-library services for
underserved groups can be labeled “Information and literacy Triage.” The term “triage” has
been used both in relation to information environments and to describe similar efforts in
education (Keenan and VanHorn, 1979; Booher-Jennings, 2005). For example, Fox and Duggan
(2013) discuss information triage in relation to the use of online health information in selfdiagnosis of medical conditions. The Pierce County Library System (Jackman, 2012) has put the
concept into use as it alters the physical space of the library to present one service point where
paraprofessionals help patrons fulfill basic needs and another to provide classes to the local
community, ultimately freeing up librarians for more difficult questions. What is novel in this
study is the way it documents and explains the concept of triage in relation to how public
libraries have prioritized and deployed resources both in their expected roles and in new ways
to meet the needs of their patrons, particularly those who are considered underserved.

91

The Oxford English Dictionary online defines “triage” as “the assignment of degrees of
urgency to wounds or illnesses in order to decide the order or suitability of treatment“(2014). By
doing something similar with their patrons, the public librarians in this study are implementing
information and literacy triage to serve patrons in underserved groups. As library resources have
been increasingly strained and the need for varying degrees of literacy support for different
groups of patrons has become more evident, public librarians have faced difficult choices in
regard to service provision. They must constantly reassess a dynamic work environment
according to the degree of difficulty associated with each patron’s need and the availability of
time, staff, resources, and personal skills needed to meet that need. Effectively, this means
rationing patron help efficiently because library resources are almost always insufficient to serve
everyone fully. As a result, public libraries are setting priorities for certain user groups.
According to an article from The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Free Library has stated that it
will turn its focus to “job-seekers, pre-K children, entrepreneurs and small-business owners, new
Americans, people with disabilities, and consumers of medical and health-care information"
(Dobrin, 2014). This focus corresponds well to many of the findings from the Pew Philadelphia
Research Initiative’s report, The Library in the City: Changing Demands and a Challenging Future
(2012). Indeed, the FLP’s initiative codifies the assertion that public librarians use a triage
strategy in service provision. Further, the initiative responds very well to the information needs
of underserved groups identified in Table 2 of the literature review for the current study.
Analysis of the data from the study revealed the existence of a new model of public
library services that builds upon past models but includes some distinctive features. For
instance, this study highlights the continuing importance of the educational-support role of the
public library, which has been a historically recognized and persistent role of the public-library.

92

Change in service provision to underserved groups has been partly driven in the past by a
number of factors, such as immigration (i.e., Americanization services); social movements (Civil
Rights), and government legislation (LSCA, LSTA). Today, economics (the Great Recession) and
technological advancements (computers and the Internet) join many of these earlier factors—
e.g., immigration—to underlie a current model of library service provision to underserved
groups. Recognition of these factors and the resulting trends they cause is worth examination in
order to meet the needs of the profession and the people it serves.
Elements of the Information & Literacy Triage Model. The Information and Literacy Triage (ILT)
Model includes one primary and five secondary elements as depicted in Figure 1: responding to
dynamism, orchestrating staffing to meet patrons’ needs, dealing with facilities, coping with
issues related to funding, managing communication both internally and externally, and selecting
and disseminating resources. Each of these elements includes multiple facets, and both the
elements and the facets often interact as public librarians work to meet the needs of patrons in
their communities.

93

Figure 1. Information and Literacy Triage Model
Dynamism—the primary element—is characterized by continuous change, motion, new
ideas, and energy. The five secondary elements are subject to the primary element, as each
represents a different task or service that must be addressed within the overall dynamism of
today’s urban public library. Dynamism requires a reconsideration of the assumption that all
libraries are equal and capable of providing the same types and quality of services. Even when
the same services or programs are offered in different branches of the same library system,
there is variation. The variations on the more or less stable service types highlight the variable
nature of the resources available. As one librarian explained:
You’ll find, I think, almost every branch does kids’ programs; you can find a story
time almost everywhere. I’m not sure that you can say that you can find like an adult
program everywhere. So, adult programs that we’ve done here—stuff like book groups,
nutrition, or health workshops where we have an outside speaker come in to talk about,
you know, that eating healthy on a budget, that kind of thing. You won’t necessarily find
those programs in every branch in the same way. (L-3)
The interrelationship of stability and variety leads to a kind of dynamism that infuses
every other element of the ILT identified during the study: staffing, facilities, funding,
communications, and resources.
Staffing. One of the major defining elements of the effective dynamic public library is
staffing. Every study participant discussed issues that revolve around staffing: staff shortages;
staff skill levels; and staff employment status (full-time, part-time, seasonal). All these staffing
issues must be addressed in order to provide effective public-library services to underserved
group.

94

Inadequate staffing levels affect public libraries’ ability to provide much of anything
beyond basic reference services, as L-1 explained:
The staffing levels again can be an obstacle, because if you constantly have
people coming up to you. That can be an obstacle, in that you may not give someone as
much time as they might need [during a service transaction]. If you have a lot of people
waiting for you, you say “Well I have to get to these other people. … And then, having
the time to weed the collection adequately. … So there have been times when we
haven’t weeded. … I don’t think anyone sticks to the weeding schedule, because, and
that’s throughout the system, that’s because it’s really more on having the time factor,
having the time and the staff to do it. So you kind of do it when you can. (L-1)
Staffing levels affect access to training and opportunities for professional development
among staff. Staff development and training are important not only for maintaining the quality
of services already offered but also for enabling staff to develop and provide new services and
to improve service provision. As one librarian observed:
Technology … changes so rapidly. … I think hand in hand with that, though, is
having sufficient staffing levels so that you can take the training, because the priority is
always maintaining service in your building and staffing the reference desk. So, any
additional training need means we have to have staffing levels to support it. (L-1)
The importance of staff development emerged constantly as a component of staffing
through which public libraries respond to dynamism. First, there is the issue of maintaining the
skill levels among the staff in a given public-library—especially when staff retire, are promoted
or leave for other places of employment. Second, there is the matter of hiring part-time staff
and seasonal workers. Since the economic recession, public libraries have had to hire temporary

95

staff as a way to deal with declining budgets, layoffs, staff transfers, and staff leaving for jobs
offering better benefits. The librarians in the study recognized the benefit of having part-time
staff but articulated a number of drawbacks to such a solution:
When they did a large layoff, maybe in 2008, they didn’t rehire a lot of people.
So now [the] Free Library’s in the mindset of hiring seasonals, part-timers, and what
they call “library facility guards.” And seasonals and library facility guards are temporary
workers. And it’s not as good as a full-time person because you’re persistently training
people to do what the full-time person already knew to do…. And then they’re going to
be gone after 9 months. They learned [something] last week, they did it last week …
they just forgot [and] did what they thought it was. And they were wrong. So now we
have a bunch of books that are stamped a little funny. And it’s just stamping books. And
if they can’t remember [these tasks] from week to week…how is that helping? (L-5)
The need to train and retrain part-time and seasonal workers is clearly a hindrance to
operational efficiencies and a persistent drain on knowledge resources. Nonprofessional parttime staff are expected to take on the mundane tasks that are essential to keeping the library
running smoothly, but they often have inadequate time and training to perform well: processing
new items, returns, and interlibrary-loan requests; handling circulation, library-card
applications, and shelving, and overseeing opening and closing procedures as well as other
administrative tasks. Shortages of both nonprofessional and professional staff combine to affect
essential library services as well as doing routine tasks. As one study participant noted:
[Our staffing situation] makes it hard. Just a micro-example, at this branch we
had not had a library assistant 2 [LA2] since October. The LA2 is the person who, you
know, if the branch manager isn’t here, the LA2 will be the one who knows, like, where

96

the key to that thing is or who to call for that. We haven’t had one of those here. So, as
a children’s librarian and manager, I’ve had to do a lot of LA2 work just to keep us
running for months. You know, I’m not unique in that. There’s many branches operating
with just one librarian or, you know, maybe they have a full complement of library
assistants but just one librarian or they have some mishmash. So that’s a challenge.
Because every time, you know, I have to help a staff member who’s unfamiliar with how
to process a payment, go do that, you know I can’t do librarian work. (L-3)
Staff shortages can have a ripple effect that resonates across an entire library system.
The ripple moves from branch to branch as well as up and down the administrative ladder. For
instance, policy typically requires there to be a minimum number of staff present for a public
library to open. When one library is short of staff, the manager will request a substitute from
elsewhere in the system in order to allow the library to open. As a consequence, some libraries
with good staffing must operate with fewer staff in order to avoid closures in libraries with
marginal staffing.
Facilities. Data from this study strongly suggest that facilities are an important element
of the ILT model the physical presence of an adequate number of public-library service outlets is
essential for providing access and literacy support for underserved groups. The importance of
physical facilities for such groups cannot be overstated. For example, some underserved groups,
such as the Amish, use little, if any, information communication technology and consequently
rely upon physical library locations to access library services. Other groups, such as low-income
urban residents, frequently have difficulty accessing information because they are often subject
to shattered information ecologies (Bishop et al., 1999, Becker et al., 2010) and thus have some,
but not all, of the implements required to access and use digital information:

97

In terms of getting people … using the Internet—and using it effectively for stuff
like healthcare management, civic engagement, banking, billing, that kind of stuff—it’s
hard to meet the need because we don’t have that many computers, and we don’t have
any kind of classroom computer space at this branch. (L-3)
Space and workstations are only two aspects of the facilities element; others include the
age of the facility, the curb appeal of an outlet, and the physical location of a branch. The age of
library facilities varies from branch to branch and helps to determine what a particular library
can offer. For example, a number of the participating libraries are either undergoing renovation
or have renovations scheduled that will expand meeting spaces, update computer facilities,
improve security, and enhance the facilities’ appearance. A participating librarian expressed the
importance of having an attractive space:
What we’re doing … is making our building more friendly … and it has made a
difference, too, in that people come in here. I mean, we look like a library. Before, we
didn’t have, this big beautiful, bright sign out there; we didn’t have this beautiful
landscape. And we’ve noticed that, [and] they told us that they came in here ‘cause,
“Oh, your building’s so beautiful, we just had to come in and see what’s inside.” We’re a
library, and they didn’t know that. (L-8)
Indeed, curb appeal is an aspect of the facilities element that directly impacts service
provision.
Funding. Closely tied to facility upkeep and maintaining adequate levels of staffing is the
corresponding funding. Aside from the obvious facets of funding such as paying for staff,
equipment, and resources, there are other reasons to examine funding as an element of the ILT
model. At present, funding for public libraries can come from a number of sources such as city,

98

state, and local governments; the federal government; and grants or other private monies. The
duration, consistency, and requirements tied to these funding sources have implications for the
focus, availability, and consistency of public-library service offerings.
Both the FLP and CCLS have indicated in their strategic plans that they are looking to
increase the amounts of private funding to supplement the public funding they receive. An
excerpt from the FLP’s five-year strategic plan (2012-2017) notes that “uncertainty of the
economic future extends especially to public financing. The public funds the Library receives
have been steadily dwindling. Reliance on these funds has left branches with serious physical
needs unaddressed, insufficient staffing levels, and collections that do not meet the needs of
our constituents” (The Free Library of Philadelphia, 2012). The CCLS’ strategic plan for 20102013 also called for an increase in the amount of private funding to ensure that public-library
services were sustainable.
The move toward more private funding is also taking place at the branch level as noted
by one librarian commenting on his fund raising efforts:
We’ve raised [thousands of dollars] from our Friends group. Out front, that was
all private money. That sign, all private. ... What we’re doing here at our location [is]
starting at an early age. We’re building onto education at an early age, [and] that we’re
hoping that’s going to grow onto them, that they’ll use the library after grade school,
after high school…as adults. So we’re spending a lot of money on our preschool
programs and our early education so we can teach our young children how to use a
library at an early age. And [we hope] that they’ll grow with that as a pre-teen/teen. (L8)

99

The benefit of locally raised and administered private funds is that there are no
significant requirements tied to how the funds are to be used other than that they be used to
support and improve the library. Additional private funding in the form of grants is also helping
to sustain and even expand library service coverage at this branch. However, it is also important
to note securing such funding requires additional staff time and expertise as well.
A good example of a service supported by private grant funding is the FLP’s HotSpots
program. Part of the city’s Keyspot program, this program is intended to provide information
access and technology classes to neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia. Six HotSpots and a
techmobile were originally funded through a combination of the Broadband Technology
Opportunities Program (BTOP) and the Knight Foundation. Now that a portion of that funding
has expired, there are only four HotSpot locations; in addition, the techmobile has been plagued
by staff and functionality issues. One librarian explained the situation:
You know, at the height of having all the funding, we had 6 HotSpots and one
techmobile. I don’t know exactly where we are now, but I know that without those
funding streams … the library’s just funding whatever is left on its own. And so the
number of HotSpots has reduced and the staff positions have changed. And now there’s
some people [who] are city-funded digital resource-specialists, so they’re civil service
and they’re not full-time. So they’re not like full-time permanent civil-service people,
but they’re on the city time sheet. And some people maybe are still grant funded. (L-3)
Another librarian described his experience with the techmobile:
Well, they’ve had a lot of staff changes. They were supposed to visit [us] in
March. I actually just sent another email; but I email about once a month asking when
they can be here, this month or next month? They’ve only come about 3 or 4 times. I

100

think it's very useful, but unfortunately we haven’t been able to get it as much as we
like. [We have only] one, [and it is] its own department. The truck has had a lot of
problems; there’s been 3 different supervisors. It’s been just tough. (L-4)
Funding can impact every aspect of library services, from staff and facilities to
availability and location. Another way that funding affects service provision emerges in regard to
how funding changes can alter the focus of an existing service or program. The requirements
that come with funding often play a role in determining not only the services that a publiclibrary can offer but also the focus of those services. One librarian explained:
In our new service model, we identified people who are new Americans, and
also [we have] new programming focused on small children. Early-childhood education
and now, with changing funding, we are moving toward the autistic community. It’s
chasing funding. There’s no other reason; there’s just no other thing to call it. When you
lose funding, when you lose funding for basic needs, you can look at ways and new
focuses for a certain amount of time to be able to get it. So again we’re just chasing
funding and renaming programs that are getting what seems to be new guidelines to do
the same thing that we’ve been doing. Just being a little bit more focused on specific
user needs. (L-9)
Communications. Communications emerged as another of the ILT because it a strong
effect on the provision of public-library services to underserved groups. There are two facets to
this element: external communications, with communities and organizations outside the library,
and internal communication up and down the organizational chart.

101

External. External communications are important for establishing and maintaining
partnerships, collaborations, and support networks with other organizations, as one librarian
explained:
I think the main obstacle is just communicating with the organizations. It’s just
difficult sometimes getting in contact with someone at an organization to set up times
and dates of when they can come to a library or when I could visit somebody. I believe
we can improve our communication links between the school system or other
organizations and the library so we can provide a lot better service. At the moment, I
just don’t have enough staff where I can visit a lot of organizations or schools or camps,
to provide them the information … to improve their everyday work, or [to meet]
educational needs. (L-8)
Communication is also important for supporting outreach to underserved groups.
Soliciting feedback from such groups about the services they need, want, and like is critical to
sustaining meaningful and effective outreach. In this realm, direct communication is often
necessary:
I think it’s always good to listen to the people that you’re serving in the
community and the public and get feedback on how they perceive you and how they
think you’re doing. You know … that dialogue is good. To kind of keep the channels of
communication open so that you know what people want. ‘Cause sometimes, you know,
you think that they really need this; but that’s not what people really want or need. (L-1)
Another librarian explained why he thought it was important to communicate with local
communities:

102

I think there’s a major lack of people realizing what is here and how it relates to
who they are and where they are going. … I’m finding that the underserved
communities don’t get it. All of this [is] available to them; and it’s, like, invisible to them.
They don’t actually [seem to] see it. It’s right under their nose. And in a way it’s kind of
frustrating, but it’s a positive challenge…I love to try to get people to use the resources
to empower themselves. So…part of that whole thing is to alert young people to the
resources that are available to them and the dangers that are [confronting] to them.
Well, and try[ing] to put those things together is somewhat of a challenge ‘cause a lot of
times they’re not listening. You know, you got to figure out the words to use. (L-10)
Several of the librarians made a point of indicating that the medium is often as
important as the message that is sent. They suggested that face-to-face contact and other active
types of contact—such as flyers, emails, and handbills—are the most useful in reaching
underserved groups.
Similarly, communication issues appear to affect the work that the FLP does with the
local school system. The study participants noted a number of services designed to support
students and the schools: after-school homework help; the Literacy Enhancement After-School
Program (LEAP); story time for preschools; programs for special education classes; informationliteracy instruction; and preparation for college level assignments in terms of citation styles,
plagiarism, recognizing authoritative information sources, and organizing information through
good writing practices. Branch librarians find it difficult to maintain communication with
colleagues in the schools, as one librarian explained:
We have classes that come in, and I’ve [also] gone to schools and just talked
about library services and what we have to offer. But, the funny thing is, I know with

103

some of the schools, they have a high turnover rate, too. So, if you start making a
connection with a teacher, or the school librarian, or the reading teacher, English
teacher, [during one school year] by the time the [next] school year started, there would
be a new teacher. … Maybe you get to know the principal but, the teachers or librarian,
or reading instructors are usually more supportive of working with us than the principals
are. (L-1)
L-1 noted that communication with the local school system is constrained both by
difficulty in maintaining a consistent contact at the local school, and by low staffing levels at the
librarian’s branch that restrict time for outreach and consequently obstruct the librarian’s
efforts to follow up with the local school and to locate contact persons. Another librarian further
explained the communication situation and her strategy to cope with communication
difficulties:
That has been a challenge at times. It’s been better recently, and I think that
we’ve really made some headway. It’s more about keeping in touch with one another; I
mean, everybody’s so busy. So we need to keep reminding them about the things that
we do and how to be on their radar, so that they can remember. (L-11)
Even though communication between the library branch and the local school can be
problematic, it appears that a fair amount of communication typically occurs between the public
library and the public schools at higher administrative levels. A branch librarian explained:
Well, what the Free Library just did was a system-wide/school district wide 1st 12th grade library-card registration drive. Where the collaboration [was] initiated, I have
no idea; but every child in the school district of Philadelphia got a library card, whether
they [previously] had one or not. And eventually [at] some point in time, records will

104

merge together where kids got fines. Everyone under 11 has a fine-free card. They have
to return the material; but if it’s late, they don’t get a fine. 12 and up, they do. So it’s
like a huge thing. (L-5)
Internal Communication. Communication up and down the administrative ladder is
central to the efficient operation of a public library and also to the provision of services that
meet the information needs of underserved groups. Methods of organizing internal
communications vary with the size, centralization, degree of autonomy among organizational
units, and administrative culture of an organization. For example, direct, hierarchical lines of
communication are appropriate to the FLP because it is a unified library system. Such a pattern
would not be appropriate for the CCLS system because it is a federated system composed of
member libraries that are largely autonomous and voluntarily bound by formal agreements
regarding resource sharing and joint policies.
Data from this study do not shed any light on communication issues at CCLS, but they
confirm the need for an improved communication strategy at the FLP—a need recognized by the
Free Library itself. During data analysis, a number of issues emerged. These include
administrative departments that are disconnected from the situation in the branches, difficulty
in getting approval for neighborhood-specific collection-development requests, and frequent
communication breakdowns between central administrative departments and branch
managers. One librarian provided an example of a communication breakdown:
There have been times we’ve been kind of pressed to do certain things or order
certain books because we have a turnaround time. They suddenly got this little windfall
[of money] and then we [were] told we have to get this stuff in by, you know, 4 o’clock
[or] within two days. I don’t know what caused the situation; but I could think of a

105

couple of times where it filters down through ranks, and we are rushing to get all the
items because there was this money available. But, you know, you couldn’t make the
best choices because you’re too rushed to kind of find out exactly [what] certain things,
you need certain things, [or what] other things [you need] … you just don’t have the
time to find out what those things are. (L-1)
The rushed selection process that resulted from this communication breakdown
illustrates the centrality of communication as an element in conceptualizing the library as a
dynamic entity.
The FLP has recognized the need for a more effective internal communication program
in order to increase operational efficiency and has taken steps to resolve the issue. An excerpt
from the Library’s strategic plan notes that “We will review our organizational structure so that
staff can be most effective and equipped to meet the challenges ahead. To adapt quickly, we
have to execute quickly. That, in turn, requires the removal of barriers that limit and impede
communications or which also hamper staff from achieving their goals” (FLP, 2012). Currently,
the FLP is actively pursuing this goal of improved internal communications. In a recent job
announcement for the position of Chief of Staff to the President and Director of the Free Library,
the improvement of internal communications was cited as one of the position’s tasks:
The Chief of Staff to the President & Director of the Free Library of Philadelphia
will provide … operational oversight for the internal communications program for the
Library. as well as help drive the Director’s agenda, in partnership with the
organization’s Board of Trustees, the Board of Directors of the Free Library of
Philadelphia Foundation and the leadership team of the Library. ... A critical component
of the work of the Chief of Staff will be to establish, define and grow the Free Library’s

106

internal communications strategy as outlined in the current strategic plan of the
organization.
Issues with internal library communications can affect communications with other
external organizations such as local schools. The branch librarians are subject to communication
breakdowns both vertically (branch to central administration) and horizontally (branch library to
local area school). One librarian provided an example:
I could just approach 2nd grade teachers at [my local] school and say I want to
come to your faculty meeting and I want to do all that stuff, but I wouldn’t really have
anything to institutionally offer them. I’d only, like, have classroom programs in the
library and materials to offer them. If that interface happened more centrally, it has to
happen at the Office of Public Service Support, which is pretty disconnected from the
day-to-day work we do in branches. I might get an email from someone informing me
that I’m required to meet with 4 teachers from [the local school] and go to their faculty
meeting. But there might be no faculty meeting for a year. So there’s that. When stuff
does happen more centrally, it happens on a bigger scale. But then a lot of stuff can also
fall through the cracks because no one is ever following up to see if I met with them. (L3)
The disconnection between the central offices and branch libraries that L-3 mentioned
was echoed several times by other participants over the course of the study. For example, L-8
noted that central administration is out of touch with the local communities:
In the past, a long time ago, librarians would have more opportunity to order
things for their collection like community a profile. We knew what our community
needed and we would be able to order the books. But now everything is centralized,

107

and I don’t like it. ‘Cause they really don’t understand what we really need at our
communities. It’s hard if you’re out in the library at the branch. You know what we’ll
need, but they never visit our libraries. (L-8)
In order to be connected with what’s going on in the branch libraries and the
communities they serve, the internal communication strategy at the FLP will need to utilize both
indirect and direct means of communication with branch libraries and the service areas of those
branch libraries. L-8 further commented on how internal communications recently improved at
the FLP:
It’s slowly getting better, but there’s a need to improve communication from
the branch to the administration downtown. I mean, we do monthly reports and
statistics; but I don’t think they could get a good understanding of what’s going unless
they visit, and they don’t visit. Nobody visits. I mean, I could videotape what we do here
and send it to them; but they basically rely on our monthly reports and statistics to see
what’s going on at our branches. (L-8)
In regard to public-library services for underserved groups, mid-level administrators
seem very aware of the situation in the branches and are actively working to meet the needs of
underserved groups in their respective areas. Of particular note are the efforts of the area
administrators of the FLP; who work in the regional libraries; and visit the branches to become
aware of the situation there. They are particularly active in regard to communication with higher
administration and securing resources that are needed in the branches.
Resources. The resources available to any public librarian necessarily expand or limit the
options available to assist patrons, often in dynamic ways. Resources are an important
component of ILT because those available at any one branch are probably as variable as the

108

service communities that public libraries serve and the services that they offer. Ideally, the
resources offered by the branches should reflect the needs of the local community including,
those of underserved groups. One librarian provided a good example related to ordering
language materials:
I’ve sent a few things to the materials management and the collectors for other
languages—French, Arabic, and then a number of others. A number of languages in the
Ge’ez alphabet, Ethiopian and Eritrean languages. I was trying to order some fiction, in
Arabic. It was a discretionary order, and everything that we had was children’s
material—which I certainly see the value for. But interestingly enough, I find that the
children, amongst new Americans, learn English very rapidly, through school and other
things … but [there] almost might be more need for titles and language materials for
adults. And as a branch librarian, I’m not authorized to order any of that. (L-4)
Even though materials in particular languages are often needed at specific locations,
other resources—such as computers that are ubiquitous also directly affect underserved groups’
ability to use certain resources:
I can’t imagine how the youths would react if there were not computers. Now,
I’ve talked to colleagues, and it’s the same thing here. When the Internet or computers
are down, people leave, and there’s empty libraries. … A lot of our branches now say,
“Internet is down; it’s cleared out.” (L-8)
For underserved groups in particular access to electronic resources is critical to meeting
their information needs.
Analysis of data gathered for this study show that the elements identified through this
research are essential to the effective provision of public-library services in underserved

109

communities. They form the basis of the Information and Literacy Triage model proposed here
as a description of contemporary practice and as a guide to future practice as well.
Understanding that public library services are based on the dynamic nature of elements such as
funding, staffing, facilities, resources, and communication is essential both for identifying
problems with service provision and in designing solutions to those problems. Indeed, when
public library resources are spread thin, it is important to be able to identify problems as they
emerge, determine the causes quickly, and enact solutions fluidly. The Information and literacy
Triage Model attempts to capture the dynamic issues that public librarians must address in their
daily work practice. In performing information and literacy triage, librarians continually assess
ever-shifting situations in which a number of factors determine how they will be able to address
patron needs.

Chapter 6: Conclusions
Conclusions
Public libraries have long served and continue to serve underserved groups within urban
contexts. However, few studies have examined public-library service approaches for
underserved groups over time; still fewer have attempted to articulate models of public-library

110

services to underserved groups—particularly in the wake of ubiquitous ICT’s, the recent
economic recession, and rising poverty rates nationwide.
The Information and Literacy Triage model suggested by this study’s data serves as both
an effective description of contemporary public-library practice and as a metaphor for the
direction of public-library services and policies in general and for services to underserved groups
in particular. Public librarians must help whom they can with the resources they have at hand.
Moreover, public libraries now find themselves needing to prioritize the segments of the
underserved populations they must serve. This prioritization is a pragmatic approach, given the
limitations on resources and the proven risk of funding cuts or resources that once seemed
secure. The findings of this study illustrate the effects and effectiveness of Information and
Literacy Triage for underserved groups. The findings point to a number of dynamic elements
that underlie triage decisions. In addition, they illustrate service gaps and obstacles to service
provision for underserved groups in particular.
It is important to note that the preceding findings uncover only part of the overall
picture because the Information and Literacy Triage model illustrates only one side of the
service interactions in the library. Within the context of the information worlds model, the
public library represents one type of information world—official information sources—while
underserved groups can represent a number of different types of small information worlds.
Some examples of such small worlds in underserved communities could include the residents of
a retirement community, tenants of low-income housing projects, or even the prisoners in a cell
block. To uncover the other half of the library service interaction, and to expand the model to
encompass a variety of information small worlds further research is needed.

Implications of this study
Major practical and educational implications of this study apply to all elements of the ILT
model. Staffing issues are particularly significant. Staff shortages were by far the most prevalent
obstacle to the provision of library services to underserved groups. Tied to that shortage is the
need to ensure that staff receive more training and have more clearly defined roles for different
job classifications regarding technology assistance. These issues are reciprocal, and solving one
can alleviate another. For instance, alleviating the staff shortages can allow staff the time to
attend training programs that are already available. In regard to technology, more explicit
definition of roles among job classifications could serve to better direct the efforts of staff when
serving patrons. For example, if administrators assign the role of technology assistance to
librarians, librarians would become responsible for supporting patrons with technology in
almost any form. The potential downside of such an action would be to add an additional
burden to a job classification that is already barely able to cover its current responsibilities.
An organizational implication of the ILT model relates to a multitude of issues
surrounding communication, both internally and externally. Improvement of internal
communications or a lessening of administrative centralization might allow branch staff to meet
newly emerging needs, such as ESL materials in a wider variety of languages.
A major conceptual implication of the model relates to identifying emerging user needs
and providing resources to meet those needs. The availability of resources to meet the
information needs of patrons is essential to the ability of public librarians’ ability to provide
services. The resources offered by the branches should reflect the needs of the local
community—changing dynamically in order to meet these needs.

112

Another practical implication relates to the facilities available to public libraries. This
study suggests that the curb appeal of a library facility is tied to the local community’s
awareness of public-library services in its area. Data from the study indicate that higher levels of
community awareness can be tied to higher usage rates. The physical presence of a publiclibrary outlet in an underserved community is important because of ICT access needs that
emerge from living with shattered information ecologies. In tandem with the physical presence
of a library outlet, is a sufficient amount of space and terminals is required to provide sufficient
capacity to meet demand.
Two major funding-related implications from this study are also reflected in the ILT
model. First, data from the study suggest that diversification of funding streams—i.e., using a
combination of private and public funds—is an effective means of ensuring a degree of financial
security to support continued provision of services. Second, funds that are raised locally can
provide a higher degree of autonomy for branch librarians in regard to how those funds can be
used.
The findings from this study and the corresponding service model have implications not
only for improving services at the local level but also for addressing local, regional, and national
policy issues related to the digital divide. Recognition of the factors that perpetuate the digital
divide— e.g., inconsistent Internet and technology access, poor technology skills, and low
literacy levels—is important for mounting a strong argument for continued government support
of programs and for a variety of measures to combat the digital divide. The findings from this
study also have pertinent implications for fields and professions beyond libraries. For instance,
an in-depth understanding of the information behavior of underserved groups could be useful to

113

other service-based professions such as healthcare provision, civil services, policing, and social
services.
In order to do enable public librarians to perform information and literacy and triage
effectively, modifying or adjusting the public-library infrastructure in a way that accepts the
nature of this service strategy and the realities that reinforce its use is critical. Addressing the
inter-related and dynamic issues of staffing, funding, resources and design of spaces (interior
and exterior); communication (internal and external) should be a priority for public library
administrators who server underserved groups. Organizing the public-library infrastructure in
ways that acknowledge that service these groups involves information and literacy triage could
make a significant impact of the effectiveness and efficiency of service provision to all library
patrons.
Recommendations
Based on the results of this study and the implications of the ILT model, the researcher
provides the following recommendations:


Two recommendations are proposed as possible solutions to the technology-literacy
support gap that could be implemented once the staff shortage obstacle is addressed.
o

A key recommendation is the creation of a new job classification or job subclassification rather than designating technology assistance to an existing job
classification. The increasing presence of technology and its integral place in
basic life services, such as the movement of government services into an online
environment, is especially problematic for underserved groups because they
often have relatively poor technology skills. The creation of a new job
classification focused almost exclusively on the maintenance and provision of

114

technological services could be a major step toward closing the most
troublesome service gaps that currently plague public-library service to
underserved groups.


The creation of such a job class in libraries across the nation would have
implications for LIS educators and degree programs. Curriculums would
need to be adjusted to include new classes designed to equip graduates
with the skills necessary to meet the challenges of such a position.



From a research perspective, the implementation of a new job
classification would offer opportunities to explore the role of that
classification within public libraries, in order to examine how the
presence of a technology-oriented librarian alters the dynamics of
service provision.

o

Technology assistance: As an alternative, the specification of responsibility for
technology assistance to a particular job classification would reduce confusion
about which staff persons need to assist with this growing task. Moreover,
designating technology assistance to a particular job classification would focus
training and education for that classification and potentially improve provision
of technology services for underserved groups. A more focused approach to
technology assistance could potentially lead to more effective use of limited
staffing and resources for technology training to address the acute need for
technological literacies among underserved patrons.



Another recommendation is improving both internal and external communication
processes. Improving communication would allow for more effective external

115

partnerships with non-library organizations such as public schools. Improving internal
communication would improve the public library’s ability to respond to emerging needs
such as serving new Americans who speak languages that are not currently well
represented in collections.
o

Given a highly centralized administrative structure, a public library would
necessarily need a strong and efficient communication network. With such a
network in place, the public library would receive information about the specific
needs at the branch level, such as a new language group in one area or high
unemployment rates in another, and could develop service responses to
address those needs.

o

Alternatively, better mechanisms for alerting the higher administration or the
whole organization about localized or neighborhood issues may present a
solution. Such a mechanism would at least partially ameliorate the disconnect
between branches and central administration.

o

There may also be a need to explore how librarians communicate during triage
situations. Identification of new vocabularies of practice might lead to more
effective signage and collection of more representative statistics.



A recommendation to address the language-based gap is to include materials in various
languages as part of the floating collection in which “…items remain where they are
checked in, whether because they've been brought in as a customer hold, or ended up
in the book drop. Rather than ‘routing them home,’ materials are simply shelved at the
return branch” (Bartlett, 2010). Conceptually, floating collections are meant to be a cost
cutting measure that reduces deliveries and routing of materials. A possible benefit of

116

allowing language materials to float is that particular language materials may begin to
accumulate at library service outlets with patrons who speak that particular language.
Further, a system feature could be designed so that staff will be alerted to shift an entire
collection when a critical mass of floating materials is reached at a branch. This may
enable public libraries to accommodate underserved groups who tend not to check out
materials and to relocate en-masse over time.


Hiring additional staff is clearly the key recommendation for addressing issues relating
to staff shortages that emerged in the study as the most frequently encountered
obstacle to service provision. However, given that staff shortages often correspond with
uncertain funding situations, hiring more staff may not be a viable solution. A policy of
employing part-time and seasonal workers to mitigate staff shortages creates its own
difficulties: poor skill retention, problems with adequate staffing coverage during open
hours, relatively poor non-professional part-time staff retention rates, and maintaining a
consistent relationship with service communities.



A potential solution for staff shortages could be the implementation of a floating staff
system. Floating staff could move from branch to branch within a given administrative
area of a public library system to serve where they are needed most. The Free Library is
currently doing something along these lines in what FLP is calling “clustering.” Through
clustering, a unit of several libraries is created within a given area in order to share
resources, staff, and services as a way to overcome gaps in service provision. This
strategy also presents an opportunity to observe how well the Information and Literacy
Triage model represents operations on the ground.

117



A possible solution to lack of funding is diversification of public library funding sources
to bolster the resilience of services against funding insecurity that results from cuts or
shortfalls in either the public or the private sphere. The ILT model suggests that the
diversification of funding streams would both provide more security across most of the
service aspects of public libraries, and provide public librarians with additional
resources, time, and staff or to perform information and literacy triage.



In some respects, the curb appeal, or external appearance of a library facility, is just as
important as the inside. Results of this study suggest that community awareness of the
public library and use of its resources are tied to visual recognition and a degree of
curiosity that results from an attractive façade. Improving a branch’s curb appeal might
be especially important in underserved areas that suffer from urban blight and decay.



A recommendation for documenting use of services and resources by underserved
groups involves collecting new kinds of usage statistics to reflect the usage behaviors of
underserved groups could help to justify budget allocations that support services and
resources used by underserved groups. For example, collecting statistics on in-house
usage of In order to simplify the collection of such statistics, using a cordless scanner,
similar to those used in retail stores, that is connected to the library system would make
it easy to scan each item used within the library but not actually checked out.
o

Additionally, librarians could solicit verbal feedback from attendees after a
program. Another option would to use social media and direct patrons to share
their feedback and comments in that way.

118

Directions for Future Research
Much of the potential value of this study lies in the directions for future research
suggested by the patterns and themes that emerged to provide the foundation for the ILT.
Future research to validate the model is needed both to confirm the original findings and to lead
to a broader understanding of how service provision to underserved groups occurs in a variety
of contexts, in order to demonstrate the transferability of this study’s findings.
A second area of future research is to address their perceptions of public-library service
interactions in order to elicit the views of members of underserved communities. Studies of the
users’ side of public-library service provision among underserved groups would provide a more
complete understanding of the facets of contemporary public-library practice studied here.
A third area for future research is to explore the effects on librarians of working in
impoverished and sometimes dangerous urban areas. Further, exploration of public librarians’
understandings of and attitudes toward issues such as poverty and cultural literacy would have
benefits for both public-library practice and library education.
This study was both eye opening and edifying for me as a researcher. During my time as
a student, I have personally struggled in attempting to reconcile my experiences as a public
librarian with all that I learned throughout my coursework. The Information and Literacy Triage
model is my attempt to do just that. As a model of contemporary library practice, I believe it to
be as accurate a representation as I can make it. While the Information and literacy Triage
model cannot completely do justice in representing the hard work and difficult situations in
which public librarians often work, what it can provide a framework built around a set of basic,
tangible concepts that helps to convey the reality of work in public libraries.

119

Public libraries serving underserved areas are essential resources to the local
communities. In a fundamental sense, public libraries serve to bridge the gaps in the shattered
information ecologies of the underserved. It is this shattered ecology that necessitates the
triage strategy. Never knowing exactly what tasks or needs they will be faced with, public
librarians must constantly assess and reassess patron needs against available resources. Given
dynamic forces affecting aspects of library services (staff, funding, communication, etc.) the
triage strategy is a means of coping with constant uncertainty. The uncertainty public librarians
must accommodate is two-sided: on one side, patron needs and requests are relatively
unpredictable; on the other, a degree of uncertainty underlies every aspect of service provision.
Given that level of uncertainty, Information and literacy Triage should be viewed as an
admirable coping mechanism.

Appendix C: Observation Protocol
Observation Protocol
The researcher will enter the research site; announce his/her presence to the associated contact
person for the research site.
The researcher will be seated at a table in the area of the public-library where adult services are
primarily provided. An available table will be selected that provides a good view of the portion
of the library to be observed.
How field notes will be taken
Field notes will be recorded in Microsoft Word on the researchers’s laptop. If an outlet is not
available and the laptop’s battery begins to fail, the researcher will continue to record
observations in a research notebook. Any notes taken in the research notebook will be
transferred to Microsoft Word within 24 hours of the end of the day’s observations.
The researcher will sketch the layout of the observation as a point of future reference.
What will be observed during observations?
Verbal Behavior and Interaction: Who speaks to whom, the approximate amount of
time, who initiates interaction and for what reason, as well as tone of voice.
Verbal exchanges and interactions between library staff and patrons: The
researcher will attempt to record who initiates interaction with whom, what the
relative ages of the actors are, the tone of voice used, duration of interaction,
number of interactions, reason for interaction and positioning of actors.
Verbal exchanges and interactions between patrons: The researcher will
attempt to record the details of interactions between patrons. Aside from
appearance of actors, the researcher will record who initiates interaction with
whom, what the relative ages of the actors are, the tone of voice used, duration
of interaction, number of interactions, reason for interaction and positioning of
actors.
Use of library resources: Which library resources are used, how often they appear to be

The researcher will identify which library resources appear to be used and how
often they are used. Additionally library materials on display, left in reading
areas or on shelving carts will also be examined. Additionally, where possible,
the researcher will observe what patrons are utilizing library resources for, such
as in the case of library computers or items in the library collection.

patrons stay, who they are (ethnicity, age, gender) if they enter alone or
accompanied and how many people enter.
Frequent Patrons and those who stand out: Identification of patrons who frequent the
research site or who stand out.

day. Brief notations in the form of the comment function will be added to provide memory cues
for the researcher. Within 24 hours of the observation period, the researcher will expand the
notes taken during the preceding observation period.

Vita
Adam was born in Cleveland, Ohio and lived there until he was 10, when his family
moved to Alabama. He grew up in the Birmingham area, and eventually went on to attend the
University of Alabama (UA). During his time there, he majored in History, and became interested
libraries while working as a student assistant in the University’s library system. After completing
his undergraduate degree, Adam applied and was accepted to UA’s School of Library and
Information Science (SLIS). He eventually went on to accept a job with the Free Library of
Philadelphia. While working as a librarian in West Philadelphia Adam became increasingly
interested in the intersection of the digital divide, information access, literacy levels, cycle of
poverty, and access to opportunity. Feeling frustrated by an inability to make a broader impact,
he sought other ways to make a difference in the world. Eventually he found himself at Drexel
University, where he worked diligently to gain a deeper understanding of the issues surrounding
the digital divide.
