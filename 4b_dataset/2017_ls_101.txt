The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework

Abstract
Veterans constitute a significant group in society, and reports have shown that the
number of disabled veterans keeps increasing. More than 50,000 United States troops have been
injured since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began and the numbers will increase until the
troops are withdrawn (Geiling, Rosen, & Edwards, 2012). Consequently, services to disabled
veterans remain very crucial to information service providers. The goal of this study is to
analyze the barriers and challenges that disabled veterans face when using library services. This
study used the Student, Environments, Tasks, and Tools (SETT) framework to explore how
disabled veterans interact with library services (Zabala, 1995). Two surveys were conducted to
provide data for a critical examination of the four elements (veteran, library, tasks and assistive
tools) that provided insights into how librarians can better understand veterans with disabilities
within the library setting. This study also captured and compare both the librarians’ and the
disabled veterans’ perceptions of library services. The major contribution of this study is the
creation of the Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools (VLTT) model which helps librarians to better
understand and support disabled veterans’ information seeking within the library environment.

1. Background

Libraries are “portals” where communities seek information. The library is often a
cornerstone in its community (Hang Tat Leong, 2013). Libraries serve all segments of society:
children, youth, adults, and seniors across all economic levels. In any library, access and
independence for all patrons, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, is a top priority
(Alexander, 2005; Association of Specialized & Cooperative Library Agencies [ASCLA], 2011;
Gibson, 1977; Mates & Booth, 2012; Mates & Reed, 2011).
In the library environment, the term “assistive services” is often used to represent the
professional services of librarians to facilitate learning for disabled patrons. Assistive services
include any services that directly support disabled people in acquiring and using appropriate
technology to expedite their successful participation in an environment (Alexander, 2005).
Assistive services help to provide access, independence, and alternatives, plus they ultimately
enhance the value of library services for people with disabilities. Because no single disciplinary
perspective can sufficiently address the issues surrounding assistive services, an interdisciplinary
approach becomes essential to meeting the needs of disabled patrons in the library setting
(Brodsky & Pencek, 2014; Brown & Freund, 2010).
Assistive technology and services pedagogy are not new to the field of library and
information science. Researchers, information professionals, and other stakeholders continue to
refine the assistive technology pedagogical standards and move beyond the shelves to determine
how they can better serve disabled patrons (Eggett, 2002; Green, 2009; Guder & Booth, 2012;
Ingle, Green, & Huprich, 2009; Sunrich & Green, 2006). Veterans have special physical,
emotional, and mental needs, and people with disabilities often do not have the same level of
14

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
access to libraries and library resources compared to their nondisabled peers (Burke, 2009;
Hersha & Johnson, 2008; Junus & Booth, 2012). An evaluation of returning veterans’
information needs shows that veterans may be seeking new employment, may desire to return to
a former job position, or may simply want to read for recreation (Evans, 2012; Gartland, 1944).
The American Library Association (ALA) recognizes that disabled library patrons are an
often neglected part of society (Alexander 2005; Mates & Booth, 2012). This implies that
people with disabilities, most specifically veterans with disabilities, need to be better served by
libraries. However, it is true that libraries overall have established some level of accessibility for
patrons with disabilities. This is evident in the passages of the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (1975) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) that require equal access in
schools, workplaces, and public facilities – libraries included. Nonetheless, librarians need to
take further steps to facilitate the effective delivery of assistive services to disabled patrons in
today’s changing digital world (Gibson, 1977; Riley, 2007; Jones Alt, Bausch & McLaren,
2013).

1.1 Rationale
Brodsky and Pencek (2014) presented a strong case for this emerging scholarly field and
the need for librarians to lead in a growing body of knowledge concerning services for veterans.
They posit that “veterans’ studies may emerge as a field of academic inquiry requiring library
support” (p. 142) and assert that information professionals need to pay attention to the formation
of this new area of study. This scholarly field has attracted a lot of attention in the broader
community of librarians and archival scholars, thereby charting the course for a new branch or
domain of study.
15

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
Broadly, literature in the field of Library and Information Science (LIS) discourse related
to veterans has focused most on five topical areas:
1. General disabilities (Gibson, 1977; Guder & Booth, 2012; Junus & Booth, 2012;
Willis, 2012);
2. Veterans returning to school (Atkinson, 1950; Sojdehei, 2013);
3. Clinical or medical librarianship for wounded veterans (Baatz, 1949; Bandy, 2015;
Schneider, 2001; 2006; Stephenson & Taylor, 2011);
4. Economic empowerment for returning veterans (Hoppenfeld, Wyckoff, Henson,
Mayotte, & Kirkwood, 2013); and
5. Veterans History Project (VHP) that compiles accounts of historical facts and
documented tales of war (Baranowski, 2009; Speck, 2012; Taylor, Lofton & Mohindra,
2010).
Most studies of veterans and libraries have been based on historic librarianship, which
was an outgrowth of hospital work during World War I. Only a few studies have evaluated
barriers to access of disabled veterans’ information needs in libraries. More importantly, there
has been a scarcity of studies centered on veterans’ perceptions of assistive services in LIS.
Burke (2009) reproached this with the observation that “lacking in the library literature were
studies that measured the perceptions of people with disabilities toward changes in libraries” (p.
45).
Leong and Higgins (2010) advocate for information professionals to prioritize efforts to
identify the gaps in the perceptions between librarians and patrons concerning library services as
pathways to improved services for disabled veterans. Any differing thoughts and perceptions of
veterans and librarians should call for alignment to ensure the effective delivery of library
services. Therefore, evaluations of assistive services, tools, library collections, and overall
accessibility in libraries need to be done periodically by librarians.

16

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework

1.2 Significance of This Study
Although there is a formalized educational system today, libraries are still the front line
of learning (Dilevko & Soglasnova, 2013). The mission of each library is to serve all patrons
(Burke, 2009; Hutchinson, 2001). In the United States, the number of disabled veterans is
increasing; one in ten veterans now is disabled (Veterans Inc., 2010). After a long-sustained
U.S. military invasion in Iraq, American troops are finally coming home. Many of these
returning soldiers now have some sort of disability, ranging from learning disabilities to severe
brain trauma to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (Williamson & Mulhall, 2009).
Consequently, the number of disabled U.S. citizens is likely to continue to rise, and libraries
need to be aware and technologically equipped to meet more diverse needs. Statistically, as of
2015, the total number of deaths since the United States invaded Iraq has hit 4,424 while 31,951
have been wounded in action. Similarly, the “Operation Enduring Freedom” in Afghanistan has
left 20,071 injured (U.S. Department of Defense, 2015).
In LIS, there is a definite paucity of research which focuses on veterans adjusting to
civilian life. Disabled library users often find it difficult to access library resources, and a larger
percentage of individuals with disabilities find most assistive technologies irrelevant,
problematic, and/or incompatible (Burke, 2009; Epp, 2006; Hersha & Johnson 2008; Junus &
Booth, 2012; Sunrich & Green, 2006). The findings of this current study may be useful in
informing librarians and technology staff members about how to better support returning
disabled veterans with their different tasks in library settings. The results may also enlighten
policy makers about policy developments that could ease access to libraries for returning
veterans.
17

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
The Veterans History Project (VHP), which was created 14 years ago by the Library of
Congress, remains the largest collection of oral war history in the United States and a huge
repository of veterans’ stories that is used to build collections for libraries (Baranowski, 2009;
Taylor et al., 2010). Libraries must give back by ensuring access, partnership, and effective
service for wounded warriors.

1.3 Purpose of This Study
The goals of this dissertation are to understand the assistive needs of disabled veterans
within the library environment, to discern the barriers that veterans face when using libraries, and
to recognize the issues that librarians face when developing services for people with disabilities.
A further key goal is to bring to light the differences in perceived notions of library services
between disabled veterans and librarians.
SETT is an acronym for Student, Environments, Tasks, and Tools. The SETT framework
is an approach that advocates the need to understand a student’s needs, environmental barriers,
and tasks before recommending the appropriate tools or technology to be employed. The SETT
framework has been adapted in the field of education for assistive technology implementation
and strategies (Eisenberg, Dye, Jones, Lyons, & Yancey, 2008; Zabala, 2005).
To achieve this current study’s stated goals, the SETT model will be represented within
the library environment by replacing the elements of the SETT model (Student, Environments,
Tasks, and Tools) with Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools (VLTT). This work is established in
the reproducibility and deliverables of the SETT model in the library environment along with the
interdisciplinary nature of the LIS profession. The overriding goal is to improve information
services to disabled veterans. See Chapter 3 for more details.

1.4 Research Questions
Top objectives of this study are to analyze the barriers and challenging tasks that disabled
veterans face when using the library space or environment and to illuminate the pathways that
librarians can follow to satisfy veterans’ information needs. To proceed toward meeting these
objectives, specific questions need to be asked:
1.

What are the accessibility issues currently confronting disabled veterans when they visit
a library?

2.

What are the information needs of disabled war veterans?

3.

Do libraries provide an accessible and open environment that supports veterans in
satisfying their information needs?

4.

How do veterans perceive library services and the usefulness of assistive technology?

5.

How do librarians perceive assistive technology services to disabled veterans?

6.

What are potential methods of better serving disabled veterans that visit libraries?

2. Literature Review

In this section, the literature on library services for veterans is reviewed, focusing on the
literature regarding veterans’ perception of assistive services as well as veterans’ history and
accessibility within and around the library space. This review provides background for veterans’
study in the library and investigates the role of librarians in satisfying veterans’ information
needs.

2.1 Libraries as Learning Environments
Libraries are learning environments. As such, libraries serve patrons with diverse
learning skills and needs. Libraries are filled with variety of learners. To ensure that the
diversity of learners has access to resources, librarians need to maintain a Universal Instructional
Design (UID) or Open Learning Environment (OLE) for all patrons (Booth, 2012a; Burgstahler,
2012; Creamer, 2007; Passman & Green, 2009; Pliner & Johnson, 2004; Riley, 2012; Schmidt,
Sennyey & Carstens, 2005). Universal Instructional Design provides accessible alternatives for a
wide variety of patrons with disabilities by using different kinds of support and strategies.
Edyburn (2011, p. 43) stated that “universal design for learning (UDL) offers theory and practice
principles for designing learning environments and materials where supports are embedded to
support learning for all students.” Universal Instructional Design (UID), which is often
interchanged with Universal Design for Learning (UDL), refers to a broad-spectrum solution for
inclusive learning that started in 1997 after the re-enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act [IDEA] with the central goal of gaining access to the “curriculum,” and physical
20

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
access within the learning environment (Edyburn, 2010, p. 33). The term also denotes “inclusive
learning” and support integration for all learners as a valid framework for guiding educational
practices (Edyburn, 2010, p. 34).
Historically, Universal Design Learning was first attributed to David Rose, Anne Meyer,
and their colleagues at the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST; Campbell, 2004;
Edyburn, 2008). Following the early work of Connell et al., (1997) with the direction of the
National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, the U.S. Department of Education
categorized the seven important elements of universal design or open learning environment as:
1. Flexible in use- this implies that design must offer choices and be adaptable to all
users
2. Equitable in use- which means providing access, security and privacy to all
learners
3. Simple and intuitive- design should accommodate all users and provide feedback
4. Perceptible information- it requires that needed information must be
communicated effectively to all users
5. Tolerance for error- errors within the system must be at the barest minimum
6. Low physical effort- user must be comfortable with the system or tool
7. Size and space for approach and use – allocated space and variation in
accommodation are essential.
Other scholars reiterate that the fundamental universal design principles of Connell et al.
(1997) as applied to libraries should accommodate users with disabilities in library environments
(ALA, 2001; Chodock & Dolinger, 2009; Zhong, 2012). However, access in a library involves
more than simply integrating the latest technology tools into the curriculum. Additionally, it

21

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
involves the designs and platforms that hold systems and strategies together, and ultimately, it
involves having accessible collections (Guder, 2014; Kelly, Sloan, Brown, Seale, Lauke, Ball, &
Smith, 2009) and providing support for users with special needs. Therefore, assistive technology
solutions must be well-planned and be rooted in the concepts of universal design. This parallels
the idea advanced in 2007 by Brophy and Craven to deliver a platform that fits all users. Brophy
and Craven contended that the phrase
“Design for all” in a library environment basically means that library information
technology (IT) systems and interfaces must be designed in a way that enables them to be
read and interacted with easily by all users of the library, whether they physically are
visiting the library itself or accessing it remotely and regardless of any disability or
access preference they may have. (2007, p. 951)
Cornell and colleagues (1997) prepared the platform for applying universal design
principles in places like schools and other learning environments. Chodock & Dolinger (2009)
further related the universal design principle to the library space a decade later, describing the
need for school librarians to center library instruction on building relationships with the students
and the faculty. This latter team of scholars explained two additional principles of universal
design which dealt with the community of learners and the instructional climate. It was
projected that the first was a channel to motivate students to learn and that the second was a
platform to allow students to reap the benefits of inclusive instruction (Chodock & Dolinger,
2009, p. 30). Guder (2014) connected the universal design principles with the development and
design of library websites. He explained that the fundamental concepts which libraries employ
to create an accessible physical learning environment can and should be transferable to those

22

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
applied to the online environment by librarians to achieve accessibility of library resources for
diverse web-based patrons.
The relationship between Universal Design Learning (UDL) and assistive technology had
been a point of confusion (Edyburn, 2010). To understand the connection between UDL and
assistive technology, first there must exist a basic understanding of the principles of universal
design. The process of universal design in the library environment implicates the prerequisite to
think ahead “about delivering library instruction in a way that is accessible not only to students
with disabilities but also to students with mental illness or depression, language barriers, or any
other difference” (Chodock & Dolinger, 2009, p. 30). Based on the literature, universal design,
as it concerns librarians, necessitates that instructional materials are accessible to all students.
This demands advance planning to get to know the patrons and understand their individual
needs, and to adhere to given standards (ALA, 2007; Chodock & Dolinger, 2009).
In a similar study, Creamer (2007) proffered this same notion of universality and highlighted the
need for librarians to do the following: (a) anticipate a wide range of users, (b) consider the
flexibility of materials and media to be used for instruction, (c) consider the multiplicity of
abilities and encourage feedbacks, and (d) provide sound evaluation of processes and techniques.
In a study focusing on inclusive education, disability, and library services, Myhill, Hill, Link,
Small, & Bunch, (2012) described a New York State project that was conducted and was known
as “ENABLE,” (Expanding Nondiscriminatory Access by Librarians Everywhere). The
ENABLE study emphasized the need for implementing Universal Design Principles and for
adopting the “right” assistive tools in libraries to ensure equal access for all users.
Burgstahler (2012) clarified the term “universal design” for libraries by identifying four
key points which were included in the formation of a basis for this current study. She defined

23

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
“universal design” as being able to (a) get to the library facility and maneuver within it, (b)
communicate effectively with support staff, (c) access printed materials and electronic resources,
and (d) fully participate in library events and other activities. This strengthens the argument of
Booth, (2012b) that libraries and librarians must commit to universality to achieve accessibility.
In summary, the universal design principles took a center stage when cracks in the edifice
of access to resources and materials in libraries began to become apparent. In 1990, the
mandates of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) further forced this topic to the front
doorsteps of libraries and were accompanied by the directives of the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA). The IDEA guidelines charged the implementation of fully inclusive
integration of every student with disabilities in schools and libraries. Libraries are expected to
champion this course by creating an open environment, implementing universal design, and
training librarians to cater to disabled patrons, veterans included.

2.2 Veterans’ History as Related to Libraries
Veterans constitute a unique population with special needs. Consequently, libraries are
called upon to effectively serve veterans, connect with veterans, and coordinate all of their
activities for veterans in a way which meets veterans’ unique information needs (Gartland, 1944;
Watkins, 2013; Wiegand, 2005). Libraries offer “both electronic access, as well as a wide range
of programs and services that provide human connections” (Watkins, 2013, p. 14). In this light,
public libraries, especially those close to military bases, are believed to be “good links” to
storehouses of resources for veterans in all spheres of life. Considering libraries from the
perspective of life, libraries offer outreach services and programs (such as literacy classes,

24

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
entertainment, and computer access) to support veterans in their transition from active military
service back into civilian life.
One of the most renowned national preservation efforts in recent times is the Veterans
History Project (VHP) where veterans’ memories and combat experiences are shared,
documented, and archived (Baranowski, 2009; Taylor et al., 2010). Libraries represent a place
where veterans can come to share their stories in person. The VHP collects “first-hand” accounts
and features unparalleled collections from veterans that served during periods of war. Thus,
libraries have assisted in the perpetuation of these classic stories and have provided groundwork
for research into veterans’ multifaceted needs, hereby carving out a niche for an emerging
scholarly field (Brodsky & Pencek, 2014).
Librarians have not just assisted veterans in libraries alone. They have provided research
support needed for an initiative called the “Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with
Disabilities” (EBV; Hoppenfeld et al., 2013). Because of the protracted high rate of
unemployment among veterans, the National Education Plan has become involved in helping
veterans achieve their dreams by utilizing the support of business librarians in the EBV boot
camps. Business librarians offer specialized management courses and partnership programs to
veterans enabling the veterans to achieve success as “vetrepreneurs” (Hoppenfeld et al., 2013, p.
306). Major goals of EBV librarians are to meet the business information needs of veterans and
to aid them in making sound business plans and choices. In an extensively similar way, the GI
Bill has financed an unprecedented number of veterans in returning to school, and librarians in
academic institutions continue to uphold the massive influx of student veterans. An estimated
two million veterans are eligible to take advantage of the opportunity to transition into scholastic
life for educational pursuits in their chosen fields of study (Sojdehei, 2013).

25

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has directly or indirectly benefitted from
library services ever since World War I. An account by St. John & Hays (1947) examined the
library services at veterans’ hospitals dating back to early librarianship when pioneer librarians
opened doors to information on any subject matter by supplying reading materials (books)
through patient libraries to patients who were physically or mentally ill (p. 264). This parallels
the much more contemporary appraisal by Stephenson & Taylor (2011) of Librarians On Call at
the Veterans Affairs Library Network in which this is praised as “one of the largest and most
successful health science library networks” (p. 175). The electronic and virtual reference
services offered by this veterans’ library network across the United States are providing good
alternatives to local libraries. This indicates that libraries are taking their rightful place in the
dissemination of online information, fast tracking access not only for individuals but also for
organizations.
2.3

Assistive Technology and Services
People with disabilities can be broadly defined as individuals with limitations in human

actions. Assistive technology (AT), therefore, is any technology or device that people with
disabilities can use to aid them in their activities of daily living (Bryant & Bryant, 1998; EnnisCole & Smith, 2011; Guder & Booth, 2012; Hopkins, 2004; Mates & Booth, 2012). “Assistive
technology device means any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired
commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or
improve the functional capabilities of a [person] with a disability” (Code of Federal Regulations
[CFR], 34 CFR Section 300.5; Pereira, 2011). Traditional definitions of assistive technology
from the Library and Information Science (LIS) perspective show that assistive technology is
considered as an “electronic solution” or “service” (ASCLA, 2011) designed specifically for

26

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
people living with disabilities. On the other hand, educational theorist, Edyburn, (2013), cites
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) amendment definition of assistive
technology as “any item, piece of equipment, or product system” (p. 8). Scholars in education
have utilized assistive technology to meet the needs of students in classrooms (Bodine, 2002;
Edyburn, 2001; Eisenberg, Dye, Jones, Lyons, & Yancey, 2008; Sauers, 2002), and assistive
technology has also been applied in the medical sciences to improve the quality of life for
patients. Different disciplines conceive of assistive technology in different ways, and this is
highlighted in their distinct definitions. However, all disciplines concur that assistive technology
is used to maintain or improve the functional capabilities of people with disabilities.
As assistive technology and library services connect, the deliverables become evident.
Considering individuals who are “differently-able,” assistive services in the library have been
modified and enhanced to comply with the passage of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA)
of 1990 and the involvement of American Library Association to promote library service and
assistive technology for persons with disabilities (Sunrich & Green, 2006; Cassner, MaxeyHarris, & Anaya, 2011; Wemett, 2010). According to Campbell (2004) “assistive technology is
used primarily as an equalizer - a compensatory tool - and on occasion applied universally” (p.
173).
From the literature, it is clear that the global definition of assistive technology in today’s
digital world has been further supplemented (Bausch & Ault, 2008). From a broader
perspective, emphasis is placed not just on the device alone but also on the services that are
needed to make it work. Assistive technology services include any activity that directly assists in
the selection, acquisition, and eventual use of an assistive technology device (Burke, 2009; Epp,
2006; Sunrich & Green, 2006; Green, 2009; Leong & Higgins, 2010; Cassner et al., 2011).

27

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
Libraries can effectively serve diverse communities when the needs of these communities are
identified, when partnerships are developed with these communities, and when valid assessments
or practical checklists for planning are put in place (Irvall & Nielsen, 2005; Coleman, 2011;
Riley, 2012).
Sauers (2002) also believed that “libraries today are becoming more aware of the
accessibility issues that arise when providing disabled users access to electronic information”
(p.8). Hopkins (2004), while doing research into the topic of assistive technology in libraries,
presented a thorough analysis of why assistive technology might be important to support patrons
with disabilities. These reasons included (a) access to information, (b) skill development and
progress, (c) specialization, (d) self-esteem and self-reliance, (e) peace of mind, (f) peer
acceptance, and (g) lifelong learning tools. Both Hopkins and Sauers highlighted the importance
of assistive technology for disabled patrons in developing skills that are required for research and
learning within the library environment.

28

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
3. Theoretical Framework
A theoretical framework is a logical structure representing all the concepts that guide a
study; it informs the research questions and methodology. The goal of any framework is to
expose what will be examined in the study and the different variables to be measured (Ocholla &
Roux, 2011). The Library and Information Science profession is multidisciplinary; as a result of
its interdisciplinary nature, concepts and theories from other related fields are incorporated. They
are then modified and applied within the boundaries of the profession (Dilevko & Soglasnova,
2013; Luo, 2013; Sabharwal, 2011). This study employs theories from other related disciplines,
such as education and cognitive science to evaluate the accessibility and services of public
libraries accessibility and services to disabled veterans.
3.1 The SETT Framework
SETT is an acronym for Student, Environments, Tasks, and Tools (Eisenberg et al., 2008;
Zabala, 2005; 1995). The SETT framework provides a structure for data gathering that informs
and guides assistive technology evaluation, implementation, and decision making in most
learning environments. The framework is a student-centered and relatively flexible model that
helps educators in the assistive technology decision making process, and it involves the
implementation of the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) in most learning
environments (Coleman, 2011; Zabala, 2010). The adoption of the SETT model represents a
path to fully understanding the assistive technology needs of people with disabilities in a learning
environment.
The SETT framework is an individualized adaptive, non-protocol tool that guides and
organizes the implementation of assistive technology in a systematic and collaborative manner
(Zabala 2005a, 2010). The different variations in an individual’s abilities, physical needs,
29

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
experiences, and education are carefully considered under the SETT framework to assist the
disabled individual in his or her tasks – thereby increasing his or her overall productivity. Zabala
(2005b) posits, “When the needs, abilities, and interests of the Student, the details of the
Environments, and the specific Tasks required of students in those environments are fully
explored, teams are able to consider what needs to be included in a system of tools that is
Student-centered, Environmentally useful, and Tasks-focused” (p. 1). In this light, the SETT
framework is an effective tool that can answer questions of how to quantify and evaluate the
impact of assistive tools and services for people with disabilities.
3.2 Conceptualizing the SETT Framework
The SETT framework contains three vital concepts that make it relevant to this study.
First, the framework serves as a building block for implementing a universally designed
pedagogy of instructional practices in learning environments, such as libraries, to reduce barriers
and provide appropriate accommodations for diverse learners. Second, it addresses the issue of
access through individual needs assessment and gap analysis. Third, the SETT framework helps
in the selection of assistive tools to effectively participate in the environment. This model will
provide insights to help librarians develop assistive services for disabled veterans.
The conceptualization of the SETT model begins with preliminary questions that assist
the educators in developing shared knowledge, collaboration, communication, and multiple
perspectives in the process. This set of questions will allow the different involved professionals
to become familiar with the disabled individual and his or her information needs and
expectations as well as to determine the most desirable services for that individual.
The SETT framework has gained a lot of ground in the education field (Edyburn, 2001,
2011, 2013; Eisenberg, et al., 2008); however, it is yet to be explored within the library setting.
30

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
It is an established fact that librarians are considered to be educators in the schools and
communities where they serve (Grafstein, 2002; Whitworth, 2012; Wiegand, 2005).
Consequently, the elements of the SETT theory can be applied to the library setting as a way that
augments the growing body of uses of the theory. Libraries are considered to be a place where
everyone should have equal access to information regardless of formats, media, and disability
types involved (Mates & Reed, 2011; Wiegand, 2005). Just as researchers and educators have
used the SETT framework for scaffolding ideas, gathering data, and selecting and implementing
assistive tools (Zabala, 2005b; Vandenbark, 2010), librarians and media specialists in libraries
can use the SETT model. By understanding their information needs and offering specialized
services and support, the SETT model can be used to improve disabled library patrons’
achievements and to maintain equal access for all library patrons.
According to Booth (2012b), libraries are all about access, content, connectivity,
knowledge, and support. Booth describes the best objective of access as where “the fullest use of
any resource should be given to the greatest number of people” (p. 5). To effectively tackle the
problem of accessibility in the library (with regard to technology, resources, and services) using
the SETT model, librarians must have the following: (a) sufficient information about their
patrons, (b) a critical examination of the barriers within the library environment or space, (c) a
clear understanding of the range of tasks the patrons find challenging, and (d) a set of strategies
describing how library services can step up to meet patrons’ disability needs. The SETT
framework supports a thorough and simple approach to assistive technology assessment that has
been used in schools and non-school settings to identify challenges encountered by students with
disabilities and to recommend assistive tool that best suits an individual’s needs (Cochrane,
2012; Coleman, 2011; Edyburn, 2011, 2013; Zabala, 1995). Therefore, applying the SETT

31

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
model in the library setting will sufficiently answer the research questions for this study. This
study will contextualize the SETT model to assess the effectiveness of assistive technology
services to disabled veterans and the accessibility (physical access and online resources) barriers
in libraries.
3.3 Elements of the SETT Framework
The SETT framework has four key elements: (a) Student, (b) Environment, (c) Tasks,
and (d) Tools, as presented in Figure 1. The “S” in the framework represents the Student. The
framework is centered primarily on inclusive learning for students. Therefore, instructors are
concerned with what the student is able to do, his or her demographic characteristics, disability
type, cognitive level, and physical needs. The letter “E” represents the environment, which
emphasizes the different elements and structures that support or prevent students from being
productive in a learning atmosphere. The first “T” stands for tasks that the student undertakes or
tasks that the student finds difficult, while the last “T” represents the assistive tools used by
students in the environment to perform different tasks. Figure 1 below describes each element of
the SETT framework, and then there is a listing of the questions that educators and instructors
want to answer concerning each element.

used?

3.4 Developing the Veteran, Library, Tasks, and Tools (VLTT) Model
The SETT model has been used in the classroom by educators to identify and meet the
disability needs of students. Since information providers are also regarded as educators
(Partridge, Hider, Burford, & Ellis, 2014), it is very appropriate to borrow concepts from
disciplines such as education that can help facilitate learning in the library. For this study, the
application is slightly different, but the principles remain unchanged. This study depicts the
library as a classroom, as a learning environment where patrons with different disability types
share and learn. The unique situation of every patron needs to be contextualized, and the
application of the SETT model should be modified to accommodate the needs of the patron, or in
other words, operationalized to fit into a specific situation or environment. This illustrates the
flexibility of the SETT model. For this model to work in the library environment, librarians must
evaluate each patron’s needs individually.
In this modified model, the librarian’s role is to facilitate access at all levels. This is
critical because the librarian helps to maintain a level ground for all patrons in terms of access,
support, and services. The expanded roles of librarians in most libraries also include
understanding veterans’ information needs, coordinating effective learning in the library, and
mastering different assistive technologies that result in the delivery of quality services to
disabled veterans. To contextualize and operationalize the SETT framework in a library
environment, librarians must make the veteran the central focus. The SETT framework is used
here as a tool for operationalizing all the variables involved and for selecting appropriate
assistive technologies in libraries. Applying the underlying SETT theory presents a new
paradigm for assessing veterans’ present functioning level in the library, for identifying access
concerns to resources (online and physical), and for exposing assistive technology needs and

34

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
services. In addition, the SETT model identifies the best support and services that can be offered
to each veteran while this support and these services constitute a foundation for universal design.
The mission of librarians in the twenty-first century is to improve society by promoting
the creation of knowledge in their communities (Lankes, 2011). Therefore, facilitating the
creation of knowledge implies that librarians are knowledgeable enough to understand patrons’
diverse needs, to employ assistive tools, and to mediate between different variables to achieve a
desirable result (Alexander, 2005).
Johnstone, Altman, Timmons, Thurlow, & Laitusis (2009) state that the “SETT
Framework is not an assessment tool, but a series of considerations designed to guide assessment
decisions” (p. 8). To replicate the SETT framework within the library setting as a tool that
guides assistive technology assessment and evaluation, the letter “S” represents the disabled
veteran who wants to access or use the library to satisfy his or her information needs (see Figure
2). It is important to conduct a thorough evaluation of veterans’ skills, abilities, and expectations
to see how they can best be served in the library.
Similarly, the “E” in the original SETT model represents the “library environment” or
space in this proposed model. The library environment includes the physical layout,
arrangement of furniture, bookshelves, computers, knowledge materials, and overall physical
accessibility within and outside the premises of a library. A thorough assessment of a library’s
“environment” is required by a careful review of the literature that describes the standards which
libraries should employ in their design, arrangement, collections, and principles. Librarians
should be concerned with how to facilitate access to resources in alternate formats, how to
protect the privacy of veterans who visit their library, how to build service support for disabled
veterans, and how to organize an effective physical layout within their library (Irvall & Nielsen,

35

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
2005; Vandenbark, 2010; Booth, 2012a). Sound knowledge of the library setting, physical
space, arrangement, support, materials, services, and accessibility all contribute to a good
evaluation and assessment at this level (Brown & Freund, 2010; Wilhelmus, 1996).
Generally, librarians are interested in identifying and supporting the different tasks that
disabled veterans find difficult and challenging (Alexander, 2005; Balas, 1999). They can offer
support through various channels or organize instructional sessions for veterans. These sessions
can be geared toward determining more efficient physical and digital access. Librarians can
schedule meetings with veterans to discuss issues of concern, create avenues for feedback, and
ensure availability at all times to assist disabled veterans with assistive tools in their library. It is
important that librarians understand how to perform tasks with various assistive technologies in
their library and be able to guide and teach patrons to use these tools. Furthermore, librarians
should be involved in the selection of assistive technologies for their library. They should not
only be involved in procuring assistive tools but also in coordinating the implementation of
assistive tools in their library.
In summary, this study uses and modifies the SETT framework to analyze the barriers
and challenging tasks that disabled veterans face in their efforts to be actively involved in the
library space or environment. The study employs the SETT framework in its altered form to
illuminate the pathways for satisfying veterans’ information needs. This implies that disabled
veterans should be able to effectively participate and use resources in libraries without any
limitations or barriers. In its process, this study identifies the differences in how veterans and
librarians perceive library services. The focus of this study is to develop a modified SETT
framework useful in identifying accessibility issues facing disabled veterans who visit libraries.

Discovering the differences in the perception of library services between veterans and librarians
is part of the achievement of this primary focus.

4. Developing the VLTT framework in the Library Space

The goals of libraries include: (a) accessibility, (b) understanding and meeting the
information needs of patrons, and (c) ensuring open environment for all users. The proposed
Veteran, Library, Tasks, and Tools (VLTT) framework is an effective model that can help
explain the relationship between learning, veterans, and libraries. The SETT framework has
yielded useful results in schools and colleges (Zabala, 2005). The proposed VLTT model can
help model veterans’ learning experiences in environments such as libraries.
Analyzing research questions, that is, combining quantitative and qualitative data from
multiple perspectives provides the opportunity to uncover deeper meaning from the data
(Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007). This method of triangulation helps to strengthen the outcomes
(measure the different dimensions and impact) and increase the validity of the study by using
multiple sources to increase confidence in the data or phenomenon.
By modifying and extending the SETT model to the Library and Information Science
field, the VLTT framework can provides a new approach to assistive technology assessment, the
issue of critical accessibility in the library space, and the understanding of the information needs
of veterans.
Two survey instruments have been developed to capture the variables needed for the
study. In the VLTT framework, constructs that are operationalized include Veteran, Library,
Tasks, and Tools. The different constructs as associated with the SETT theory are transformed
from abstract concepts to concrete or real, measurable values.

38

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
4.1 Operationalizing the Research Questions

This study deployed two surveys. The first survey (subsections 4.1.1 to 4.1.6) was
developed for veterans focusing on their assistive needs, while another survey was developed for
librarians focusing on their experiences and perceptions of assistive services in the library for
veterans. To apply the SETT framework in the library environment, key constructs needed to be
substantiated (see Figure 2 above: Proposed New Model). The survey instruments have both
quantitative and qualitative question. The quantitative section included multiple choice, rating
scales, and sematic differential scales. Additionally, there were open-ended questions that was
used to collect qualitative data. Open ended questions helped identify common or contrasting
themes in responses, especially with issues that could not be entirely captured or that stirred
further discussion.
The following subsections provide a comprehensive definition of all construct of the
VLTT framework and the operationalized survey items.

4.1.1

Veterans

The veteran is at the center focus of the modified VLTT framework. Because Library
and Information Science is a profession that prides itself in serving diverse populations by
providing access to all patrons (ALA, 2008; Balas, 1999; Balas, 2001; Booth, 2012a, 2012b;
Mates & Reed, 2011), this study takes further steps to understand veterans’ information needs,
barriers encountered, and how to better serve them within the library environment (see Section
3.4). Therefore, this study is interested in the demographic characteristics of veterans, such as

39

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
their disability types, numbers of visits to libraries, tasks, information needs, perception of
libraries as learning environments, and assistive services available. The research questions for
this construct were:
Q1.

What are veterans’ specialized needs?

Q2.

What are veterans’ current abilities (skill level with assistive technology)?

Q3.

What systems have been tried?

Q4.

For how long have the systems been tried?

This survey presented questions (using multiple choice and open-ended questions) to
veterans to know their demographics, disability types, and barriers encountered in libraries (see
Table 1 below).

4.1.2

Libraries
In this section, the focus was on the physical barriers (such as the arrangement and layout

of libraries), open/accessible learning space, support and services, resource availability, formats,
assistive technologies, and accessibility options available to veterans in the library environment.
The questions below were generated to address issues that concern accessibility in the library
environment.
Q5. What are the resources and assistive tools available in the library?
Q6. What is the physical arrangement of the space?
Q7. What are the existing support or barriers available to veterans?
Q8. Does the library environment support and accommodate people with disabilities?
Q9. How accessible are the resources available within the library?
Q10. Is the library structured to support open access and universal design?

To apply the VLTT framework in the library environment, a set of sematic rating scales,
multiple choice questions, and open-ended questions was developed to capture veterans’
challenges and experiences in the library (See Table 2).

Open Learning Environment
Universal design principles are important for creating an inclusive environment for

diverse patrons (Booth, 2012a; Campbell, 2004; Edyburn, 2010; Pliner & Johnson, 2004), and
for accommodating a wide range of disabled individuals visiting libraries. Open environment
supports integration and facilitates learning. To solve the problem of accessibility in libraries,
full integration and universality of standards, processes, resources, procedures, and collections
must be established. This ensures that the system is balanced and that everyone is equally
served. The following set of questions (multiple choice, rating scale) specifically evaluated if
libraries are well integrated and can accommodate diverse users. Some of the questions had
46

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
open-ended options for respondents to further make comments that strengthened the results (see

4.1.4

The Tasks

The Tasks are a very important element of the VLTT framework. They represent the specific
goals that veterans need to achieve for them to reach their desired expectations. At the Tasks
level, the goals are to be as specific as possible (see discussion in Section 3.3). The tasks can be
described as veterans’ information seeking processes. Consequently, more open-ended questions
were asked to understand and capture specific needs. To operationalize the VLTT model, the
following research questions were asked:
Q11. How often do veterans visit the library for information seeking?
Q12. What type of information are veterans seeking when they visit the library?
Q13. What are the difficulties veterans encountered when seeking information?
Q14. What support can the library offer to veterans seeking information?

Assistive Tools
As discussed in Section 3.4, the assistive tools represent all the “low-tech” (such as:

pencil grips, highlighters, writing guides or templates, magnified worksheets), “mid-tech” (such
as: audio books, e-Books, DVRs, word processors, word prediction software), or “high-tech”
(such as: voice recognition, text-to-speech) tools that can be considered for disabled veterans.
Assistive technology also includes the combinations of strategies that can be used to support and
53

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
improve performance within the library environment. To enhance the VLTT framework, this
study has sought answers to the following questions (open-ended and scale rating):
Q16. What strategies might be used to increase the effectiveness of assistive technology
in the library?
Q17. How can disabled veterans’ effectiveness of assistive technology be evaluated?
Q18. How can the assistive technology project be funded?

Librarians’ Services
The following questions were answered by librarians with the aim of understanding

librarians’ perspective in their services to disabled veterans. To address problems in library
services and accessibility in libraries, it is believed that issues must be viewed from different or
multiple perspectives. As a result, both open-ended questions and multiple-choice questions
were employed to establish connecting thoughts and patterns in librarians’ responses.

4.2 Proposed procedures, sources of data, and methods of data collection
In order to achieve accurate, reliable, and valid results, it is important to collect a sample
that is representative of the entire population. This implies that the sample should sufficiently
represent the attributes of the population under study. In this light, the population for this study
included disabled veterans and disabled military retirees who have previously or recently fought
wars and librarians who are serving at public, academic, and other specialized libraries.

64

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
For this study, there were two surveys: a veterans’ survey and a librarians’ survey. The
veterans’ survey captured and assessed veterans’ perceptions of assistive services within the
library environment including the different barriers encountered by veterans when they have
visited libraries. The librarians’ survey aimed to substantiate the connections or disconnections
in the perceptions of library services between disabled veterans and librarians.
Purposive selection techniques were used to collect samples for both surveys. There are
over 19 million veterans in the United States alone (Taylor et al., 2010; Hoppenfeld et al., 2013),
but because veterans’ information is classified, it is almost impossible to get veterans’ contact
information from registered local, state, and federal organizations. However, to effectively
capture veterans’ perceptions, social networks remain a valid channel to access veterans
anonymously (Lin & Kathryn, 2012; Griffis et al., 2014). To reach disabled veterans, contact
was made with veteran associations and groups as listed in directories of the United States
Department of Veterans Affairs 1, community volunteer groups, and faith based groups that serve
and unite members of the armed forces. The Evanston Veteran Center, the United States Army
recruitment center in Evanston, and the American Legion posts across the Chicago area were
among the organization that initially agreed to email the survey to veterans.
In addition, the snowball sampling technique was employed to get more responses from
as many veterans as possible. A contact person that knew other veterans were allowed to
forward survey links to other disabled veterans. The Librarians’ survey focused on librarians
with the goal of capturing librarians’ perceptions of assistive services that they offer. The
Illinois Library Association (ILA) distributed the librarians’ survey by sending survey link to
registered librarians list. Equally, libraries that were closest to military bases were also targeted.

65

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
Web based questionnaires were used to collect data from both surveys. Online surveys
have the advantage of gathering a large set of responses, and they guarantee that the collection of
data will be in a natural and non-intruding setting. The instruments for data collection were
developed based on the objectives of the study, literature reviews, and the proposed VLTT
model. The quantitative data were used to make statistical generalizations based on the sample
while the qualitative data addressed the analytical aspects based on the proposed framework and
the constructs adopted. To enrich the study by providing more in-depth accounts of both
veterans’ and librarians’ perceptions of library assistive services, open-ended questions were
used for some topics. Doing so produced better insights and extended the conversation of
assistive services to new areas that concern this study. Data from both the veterans’ and the
librarians’ perceptions of library accessibility and services were compared and analyzed in the
next section.

4.3 Validating the Survey Instrument
The validity of an instrument also refers to the degree to which an assessment tool
produces stable and consistent results. The reliability and validity is concerned with how well
the instrument measures the actual concepts under study. Content validity and face validity were
established through pilot testing and item/construct validation to simplify complex questions, to
avoid redundancy, and to ensure that survey questions were free from external interference. To
ensure validity, three levels of evaluation were conducted.

66

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
4.3.1

Construct Validity
The validity checks if the internal structure of the data is consistent with the theory (Reis

& Judd, 2000), or to determine “the extent to which the scale adequately reflects the theory, and
the theory adequately reflects reality” (Sternberg, 1997, p. 331-332). To validate the constructs,
Ph.D. students in the Graduate School of Information Studies (IS) were asked to identify and
match constructs to appropriate item. This method helped to redefine and consolidate the
constructs. After careful evaluation by doctoral students, three constructs were reframed as
attributes of other constructs.
Each element of the constructs was further reviewed to ensure that it captured all the
attributes needed for this study. The different attributes of key elements (disabled veteran,
library, tasks and tools) were identified, listed, and operationalized using criteria and
assumptions of the VLTT model.

4.3.2

Item Construction
To ensure that there were no dimensions of redundancy and ambiguity in the instrument

of data collection, each item in the VLTT model was tied to a unique construct. A second level
of assessment was carried out by the dissertation chair to test for accuracy of the instrument.
Thirdly, Ph.D. students also evaluated the questions for consistency. Sematic differential scales
were used to construct questions for respondents allowing them to express the degree to which
they supported or disagreed with a question.

67

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
4.3.3

Instrument Validation
For both surveys, six veterans and two librarians took the survey and were asked to share

their experience based on the following questions:
1. Do the questions make sense to you?
2. Were there any questions that were confusing?
3. Were there any questions that made you feel uncomfortable?
4. Were there any questions that were objectionable?
5. Did you notice any redundant or unclear questions?
6. Do the questions flow logically?
There was 80% to 90% agreement with the questions in both surveys. Although, for the
veterans’ survey, two veterans pointed out that not all veterans are retired and requested a
correction. The list of accessibility options was modified for the librarians’ survey.

4.4 Data Analysis
Data analysis is the process of making meaning from raw data (Shenton & Dixon, 2003;
Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007). The data collected via the Qualtrics2 software was analyzed
using Qualtrics analytics, Excel, and Tableau. This study compared veterans and librarians’
perceptions on service delivery, assistive technology support, and accessibility concerns using
correlation analysis to compare means. Content analysis, descriptive statistics, and correlation
analysis were used to analyze and to compare different variables identified in the study. The
analysis supplied detailed information for the VLTT framework to model veterans’ use of

libraries and the improvements that libraries can make for accessibility and services for disabled
veterans.

5. Results
Introduction
This chapter discusses the results of the two separate surveys that were sent out in this
study. In doing so, this chapter analyzes the accessibility issues currently confronting disabled
veterans when they visit a library. Also, it delves into how librarians perceive assistive
technology services for disabled veterans, and it provides a discourse on the potential methods
for better serving disabled veterans when they visit a library.
The results will be reported in two sections: Part One reviews the veterans’ survey and
provides an overview of veterans’ information seeking using the VLTT theoretical underpinning.
Part Two reviews the librarians’ survey and describes how librarians perceive assistive
technology services for disabled veterans. Descriptive statistics, content analysis, and correlation
analysis have been used to analyze and compare different variables identified in the study.
In the two different types of online surveys sent out—the one to the veterans and the one
to the librarians—the survey questions were designed to gather data on the following:
x

What are the information needs of disabled veterans?

x

Do libraries provide an accessible and open environment that supports veterans’
information needs?

x

How do veterans perceive library services and the usefulness of assistive
technology?

x

How do librarians perceive assistive technology services for disabled veterans?

x

What are potential methods for better serving disabled veterans that visit the
library?

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
The goal of the surveys was to generate data that contributes to an understanding of the
responses received.
The veterans’ survey was targeted toward disabled war veterans who were wounded
during or after war and who have returned, or will be returning, to civilian life. The librarians’
survey focused on librarians working in public, academic, and special libraries.
The veterans’ survey suffered a minor setback because of administrative policies that
restrict how the Veterans Affairs (VA) and other affiliates allow research to be conducted (see
Appendix E). As a result, initial contacts made with veterans’ organizations did not bring forth
an adequate number of veterans who would complete the surveys. After some months of
encountering barriers in getting access to veterans, consultation was made with the professional
team of Qualtrics on Monday, August 15, 2016, to successfully distribute surveys directly to
veterans via email and through postings on social media. The research consultants from
Qualtrics were responsible for sending survey links to veterans. A total of 235 disabled veterans
completed the survey on or before September 6, 2016, and a total of $1,800 was incurred in
charges (see Appendix F).
There were three main methods that were used to find participants for the librarians’
survey. The first method was to send invitations to librarians from lists of registered librarians
drawn from specific ALA divisions. These divisions included the Public Library Association
(PLA) and the Association of Specialized & Cooperative Library Agencies (ASCLA). The
second method was to locate libraries near military bases and to target these specifically in
finding participants for this study. The third method involved the Illinois Library Association
(ILA) which agreed to post a link to the survey on their online bulletin in Volume 8, Issue 35,
which was dated December 21, 2015. The librarians’ survey was taken by 238 librarians with no

71

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
cost incurred. The results from these surveys were analyzed using traditional descriptive
statistics and will be displayed in tables. For multiple choice questions that allowed or required
survey respondents to select more than one option, it understandably follows that there could
have been a significantly greater number of responses than the number of respondents.

The first construct for this study focused on veterans’ overall demographics which led to

questions related to veterans’ disabilities, age groups, and military status. Veterans’ information
needs were analyzed using questions that pertained to their number of visits to the library and the
different tasks that veterans need to do in the library. It also included questions about veterans’
specialized needs, veterans’ current abilities, veterans’ perception of libraries, and the different
assistive technologies that have been tried in the past.
5.1.1

In what age group do you belong?

The survey asked participants to indicate their current age group. Of the 235 participants
in the veterans’ study (see veterans’ geographical distribution in Appendix F), those who
answered this question revealed that 66% of the veterans were within the age group of 18 to 45
years. This percentage revealed that respondents included a lot of younger people who have
been actively involved in the military (See Table 8). There were also a sizeable number (24%)
of veteran respondents who were in the age group of 46 to 65 years. These results deviate from
72

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
the most recent United States Census Bureau’s review showing 20% of veterans in the age group
of 18 to 44 years, while 38% of veterans were between 45 and 64 years old, and 42% of veterans
were over 65 years old (2016). The discrepancy in the numbers might be explained by the fact
that younger people, including younger veterans, are more comfortable with the technology
involved in participating in an online survey.

What is your military status?

The survey asked the participants to indicate their military status. As seen in Table 9,
99% of participants for this study reported that their military status was one of the following:
veteran, retired veteran, military retiree (a retired veteran who served 20 years or more), Reserve

73

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
member, National Guard member, or active duty military. Only two respondents (approximately
1%) self-identified as “other.” One of these two described himself as “medically separated.”

Table 10 provides data which breaks down the military status of respondents into their
respective age groups. The percentage calculations are based on the total number of respondents
in each age group. The options for “never in the military” and “civilian contractor” were
intentionally removed from Table 10 below because there were no veteran survey respondents in
Table 9 who identified themselves in these status categories. For visual clarity, in the tables like
Table 10 going forward, the fields with zero have been replaced with a “dash.”

Have you become disabled?

The survey asked veterans whether they were now disabled. Veterans’ survey
respondents who answered “yes” to being disabled represented 99% of the study population (see
Table 11). This agrees with the theory of this study that a sizeable portion of veterans returning
home to civilian life may require assistive support.

How did you become disabled?
Respondents were asked how they became disabled. A total of 79% of veterans’ survey

respondents indicated that they became disabled during active service, while 8% of them had a
disability which worsened during active service (see Table 12). Respondents who self-identified
as “other” in answer to this question were those who became disabled long after their military
service.

In which military branch did you serve?
Respondents were asked to indicate in which branch they served during their military

service, and 45% of survey participants indicated that they were in the U.S. Army. Another 19%
served in the U.S. Marines, 17% served in the U.S. Air Force, and 11% served in U.S. Navy (see
Table 13). The higher total number of responses in this part of the survey is due to some
participants who served in more than one military branch. In December 2016, statistics released
by the Department of Defense (DoD) showed a total of 1,315,609 active duty members with 35%
Army, 24% Navy, 14% Marines, 24% Air Force, and 3% Coast Guard.

In which war(s) did you fight?

The survey asked respondents to indicate in which war or wars they have been involved.
As seen in Table 14 below, a little over 95% of veterans’ survey respondents had been deployed
overseas on missions and special assignments. Among the 4.6% of survey participants who selfidentified as “other” were veterans who were deployed during the cold war or during peace time.
Table 14 shows that 54% of veteran respondents have fought in the Iraq War or the Afghanistan
War or both.

Figure 3 analyzes the wars fought by the different age groups. Of the survey participants
who fought in the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War, 63% were, at the time of the survey, within
the age group of 18 to 55 years (see Figure 3). It is very likely that many veterans within the age
group of 18 to 55 years will depend on assistive services provided in libraries while seeking
information.

What type of disability or disabilities do you have?

Veterans were asked on their survey to identify the type of their disability or disabilities.
The results presented in Table 16 disclose the different disability types. The most common
disabilities identified in this study include hearing disability (26%), ambulatory disability (18%),
mental illness (17%), and cognitive disability (11%) (see Table 16). Among the 3% of survey
participants that self-identified as “other” in answer to this question, responses like “I am an
amputee,” “I have chronic pain,” “I have asthma,” and “I have a heart condition” were among
the notable explanations.

Do you use specialized technologies?

The survey asked about whether participants used specialized technologies. Veteran
answers included 73% of respondents who indicated that they did rely on assistive tools (see
Table 17). This indicates that of a high percentage of veterans will certainly require assistive
services in places like the library to access needed information or to complete specific tasks.

The survey asked veterans to identify which assistive tools they used. In response, 25%
of survey participants indicated that they use communication and hearing aids, while veterans
that depend on vision and mobility aids were 16% of respondents. Another important piece of
data in this section is that 8% of responding veterans require assistive technology for their daily
living. This might open a new area of research in the future (see Table 18).

Table 19 presents the data of the different categories of assistive tools matched up with
the disability types reported by veterans in the survey. Veterans who were hearing disabled used
mostly hearing aids (17%) and communication aids (17%). It would be reasonable to expect that
visually disabled veterans would use mostly vision and reading aids. However, 18% of
respondents with visual disabilities used communication aids, while a somewhat lower 13% of
these veterans did use vision and reading aids. Of veterans with ambulatory disabilities, 15%
depended on mobility and transportation aids. Somewhat understandably, respondents who used
reading aids were fairly often veterans with hearing disabilities (10%). Among the veterans with
ambulatory disabilities, 10% also used aids for daily living.

How often have you visited a library?
Survey veterans were asked to indicate how often they have visited a library, and the

responses are presented in Table 20. A total of 47% of the veterans who responded have used a
library at least daily or weekly, and these individuals were categorized as “frequent users.”
Another group, termed “regular users,” included veterans who have visited a library less than
weekly but at least once per month. They accounted for 31% in the survey population. Veterans
who reported having visited a library less than monthly but at least once per year were grouped
as “infrequent users,” and they accounted for 15% while 7% non-users balanced out the
remainder in the survey (see Table 20).

All of the 14 veteran respondents who said that they had never used a library provided
additional information about their reasons for non-use of libraries via the comments text box.
Notable among these 14 responses were four respondents who cited that the time and effort to
physically visit a library was too much for them. An additional four respondents dismissed the
need to go to a library since they could more easily use the Internet to access resources and check
out materials. Three respondents bluntly said, “No need,” and another three said that they would
never go to a library for any reason.
With a significant percentage of surveyed disabled veterans reporting that they visit a
library on either a frequent or a regular basis, it was considered worthy to explore what types of
assistive tools were needed to accommodate them in the library setting. Table 21 provides a
comparison of responding veterans’ frequency of library visits with the assistive tools that they
use for information seeking. The information presented in Table 21 below reveals that
communication aids and hearing aids appear to be the most widely used. Among the respondents

85

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
who use communication aids, 62% were “frequent” library visitors (daily, weekly) while 29%
were “regular visitors” and 9% were infrequent visitors at libraries. The same pattern was
noticeable for users of hearing aids: 49% were frequent visitors, 36% were regular visitors, and
13% were infrequent visitors at libraries. Those who identified their library use as “never” were
removed from Table 21.

Veterans’ Use of Libraries
Determining how veterans use libraries to satisfy their information needs is among the

core objectives of this study. Questions that surround how libraries are able to serve veterans
86

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
and/or how libraries are organized physically and digitally to cater to the needs of disabled
veterans are the focus of this section. To answer these questions, veteran respondents to the
survey were asked some specific questions related to library services.

5.2.1

What are the resources and assistive tools available in the libraries that you visit?
The survey asked respondents to write in the types of resources and assistive tools that

they knew to be available at their libraries. A total of 210 veterans responded to this open-ended
question, and their responses were categorized into groups as seen in Table 22. Irrelevant
responses were discarded bringing the total responses to 125. Notable among the different
assistive tools and resources mentioned are computers (30%), wheelchair extensions and ramps
(22%), availability of library assistance services (11%), and alternative books (6%). Among the
tools that were reported to be inadequate were reading aids (2%) and adjustable seats (1%).

What is the physical arrangement of your library’s space, and what existing
support is available to disabled veterans or what barriers are hindering them?

A list of choices was given to the survey participants allowing them to indicate a
description of their library’s space arrangement and to identify library features that were
supportive or non-supportive of use by disabled veterans. A total of 210 veterans provided 303
answers to this multiple-choice survey question, out of which 24% of responses said that
assistive devices within the library environment are not functional (see Table 23). Also, poor
compatibility (18%), navigational issues (16%) and inadequate assistive technical staff (19%)
were considered by respondents to be problematic.

Among veteran respondents who indicated that nonfunctional devices were a major issue,
50% were “frequent users” (daily to weekly), 40% were “regular users” (at least monthly), and
9% were “infrequent users” (see Table 24). The same pattern of percentages compared to
frequency of visits is noticeable for reported problems with poor compatibility and insufficient
support from technical staff.

5.2.3

Does the library environment support and accommodate people with disabilities, and is it
structured to support open access and universal design?

Survey respondents were asked to report on whether their libraries were or were not
structured to allow disabled patrons to have access to assistive tools in that environment. As
presented in Table 25, 80% of the veterans’ survey responders believed that they have sufficient
access to assistive tools in terms of specialized assistive devices while 20% of the survey veteran
population reported that they do not have adequate access to assistive tools. Unlike the issue of
functionality that was shown in Tables 23 and 24, most veteran respondents agreed that they do
have access to assistive tools within libraries, but they reported that they still face challenges
with navigating the tools or with not finding the tools user-friendly.

How accessible are the resources available within libraries?
Survey respondents were requested to judge the ease of accessibility of library resources.

The analysis presented in Table 26 shows that almost 43% of survey responders believed that it
was somewhat easy to access resources, while a sizeable 34% of this veterans’ population
considered access to resources in the libraries very easy. It is interesting to see that 77% of these
veterans’ responders have found access to library resources easy (either very easy or somewhat
easy) while slightly less than 14% considered it difficult (somewhat difficult or very difficult).

“frequent user” veterans in the survey considered access to the library resources difficult (see
Table 27). Respondents who indicated that they were “never users” were excluded from Table

The Task
In this study, “the task” is defined as the entire process of veterans’ information seeking

or the meeting of the information needs of veterans in the library environment. This could also
be described as how easy is it for veterans to acquire desired information when they are within a
library space. This construct engenders specific questions that assist in providing answers to the
overall questions.

5.3.1

What kind of information are veterans seeking when they visit libraries and in what ways

have they encountered difficulties in this information seeking?

Respondents were asked about the types of information they seek in libraries and about
how they have encountered problems in obtaining this desired information. There were 212

92

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
veterans’ survey responders who produced the 616 responses about the types of information they
sought in libraries. There were 210 of these veterans who reported 294 responses of having
difficulties in finding the information that they sought. Results revealed that veteran
respondents at libraries usually seek information that can be placed into four main categories.
Work-related information (employment, school, or education) accounted for 20% of this
survey’s total responses as presented in Table 28. Mission-related information (political,
military, legal, faith) accounted for 33% of total survey responses. Another category of
information was recreational information (current awareness, recreation, general study) and this
also accounted for 33% of total survey responses while the category of health-related
information was represented by 14% of these responses.

As explained in Table 28 above, 36% of the difficulties reported by these veterans were
in the category of mission-related information seeking while 24% had to do with difficulties
encountered by veterans looking for recreational information in that umbrella category. Also,
22% of the difficulties veteran survey respondents reported were with the seeking of workrelated information.

5.3.2

What support can libraries offer to veterans seeking information?

An open-ended prompt of “Please describe your most recent experience where you asked
for technical support in a library” was used to identify the different areas where veterans needed
support within the library environment. Responses were grouped into two categories (physical
and computer-related), and irrelevant responses were discarded to ensure that the relevant data
were recorded. Responses from surveyed veterans reported that physical support was needed
51% of the times, and nearly the same percentage of responses (49%) reported the need for
computer-related support (see Table 29).

Assistive Tools
Disabled veterans depend on assistive tools and/or a combination of techniques to

accomplish tasks. Assistive tools define the last construct of the VLTT framework that was
employed in this study to evaluate their effectiveness when used by veterans in libraries.
Certainly, veterans with disabilities need assistive technologies to improve their efficiency and
enhance their access to resources when they visit libraries. The next set of survey questions were
designed to further probe into this construct.

5.4.1

Are disabled veterans attending library instructional sessions to help improve their
effectiveness in the library environment?

Instructional sessions were projected to be a useful tool for improving effectiveness in the
environment of libraries. Veteran survey participants were asked how many times they had

95

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
attended library instructional sessions. The data in Table 30 below show that 47% of the
responding veterans had never attended any of these sessions. Only 5% of the survey population
had attended instructional sessions six times or more. Thus, a veteran was far more likely to
have never attended any instructional sessions than to have attended them on at least six
occasions.

How would you evaluate the helpfulness of the library instructional session(s) that you
attended?
Those veteran respondents who had attended at least one instructional session at a library

were asked to rate how helpful they found this to be. Out of 110 respondents, 53 rated these
sessions as “very helpful” and 51 rated them as “somewhat helpful” (see Table 31). It was
agreed that instructional sessions were very helpful by 82% of respondents who indicated that
they had attended these sessions at least six times. Table 31 below also shows that among the
group of survey veterans who had attended only one to five instructional session(s) 8% of those

96

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
attending one time and 2% of those attending two to five times felt that the session(s) was/were
not helpful.

What did you like about the library instructional session(s) that you attended?
Those survey respondents who had attended instructional sessions at their libraries were

asked to indicate what the liked about the sessions. Table 32 below captures some positives
about library instructional sessions reported by respondent veterans. Veterans’ responses were
categorized into sub-groups for better collation and interpretation. Those veteran survey
respondents who had not attended any library instructional sessions were not counted in the
results presented in Table 32. Although 30% of survey veterans chose “Not applicable” in
response to this question, 22% believed that the session(s) was/were educational or informative
and 17% reported receiving one-on-one help from a librarian. Of note, 13% considered library
instructional sessions to be useful, good, and/or fun (see Table 32).

What did you dislike about the library instructional session(s) that you attended?
For survey respondents who had attended library instructional sessions, the opportunity

was extended to provide negative feedback about the sessions. The survey veterans’ responses to
this question were also categorized into subgroups for better collation. Of survey veteran
participant responses received to this question, 25% communication issues, 15% boring sessions,
and 13% stressfulness in sessions were named as key negative factors (see Table 33).

Have you signed up to be on the email list and to receive newsletters from your library?
The question was posed to the survey veterans as to whether they received emails and

newsletters from their libraries. The percentage of veteran respondents who had signed up to be
included on their library’s email list and to receive its newsletters slightly edged out the survey
veterans who had not done so by just 2%. There were 51% of survey respondent veterans who
felt the need to be “in the loop” of getting library updates and promotional emails (see Table 34).

How have you learned about the offerings of library instructional sessions?
The survey asked veterans about the means by which they were notified of library

instructional session offerings. The data presented in Table 36 below show that, among the 299
notifications of library instructional session offerings reported as received by 207 veteran survey
respondents, 23% of these notifications came via social media. Another 48% were extended

libraries before the library purchase of assistive tools. The information presented in Table 37
shows that 60% of the survey veterans were not made aware in advance of any assistive tool
purchases being made by their libraries. However, 40% of the veterans surveyed reported that
they were notified ahead of these library purchases.

Librarians
This section reports on the survey of librarians. A brief analysis of library types and

demographics are presented in the next tables, after which comparative analyses of librarians’
and veterans’ perceptions of assistive services are presented.

5.5.1

At what type of library do you work?
Librarians were first asked by their survey about the type of library in which they work.

The analysis presented in Figure 4 shows that a large percentage (83%) of librarians who
responded to this question on this survey work in public libraries. This can be interpreted to
mean that there are a much larger number of public library librarians represented in the survey
presented here compared to the actual number of library staff working in public libraries overall
(see Figure 5). However, this is deemed to be acceptable considering that disabled veterans are
much more likely to visit public libraries and academic libraries than they are to visit school
libraries at elementary and secondary grade levels. These school libraries do not have as many
librarians represented in the information presented in this study.

Does your library have a written policy or standard concerning treatment of patrons
with disabilities? If yes, please share the URL.

Librarian survey respondents were asked if their library had a written policy outlining the
way patrons with disabilities were to be treated. As shown in Table 38, only 23% of libraries,
for which there were survey responses, have a written policy for disabled patrons; but instead,
other libraries have guidelines and standards to which they adhere on how they treat all patrons
regardless of whether those patrons have disabilities.

Of those answering “no” about whether they have a written policy for treatment of
disabled patrons, 87% of library respondents were from public libraries (see Table 39). This
might be a very important area considering that veterans are expected to mostly be visiting
public libraries. Therefore, it could be immensely helpful if public libraries wrote specific
standards and policies targeted toward disabled veterans (and other disabled patrons) who come
to seek information or complete a task.

Do you convert items in your collections to create accessible versions for disabled
patrons?

Libraries often purchase titles in more than one formats to accommodate disability needs.
However, due to budget shortages, and with permission from authors, some libraries use
technologies to convert items to accessible format. Librarians were asked on their survey if they
convert collection items into accessible formats at their libraries. Responses from surveyed
librarians, divided into library types, revealed that 76% of public libraries and 58% of academic
libraries do not convert their collections into accessible versions while 22% of survey responses
from librarians at special libraries asserted that they do convert their collections into accessible
formats for their disabled patrons (see Table 40). Some of the justifications librarians gave on
the survey for not converting their collections were “lack of demand” and “resource constraints.”
Some surveyed librarians reported that they do not convert on a general basis but that they do try
to anticipate needs for these conversions before they arise. Some other surveyed librarians
responded that they believed “the need to do so has not arisen” or that they had “never been
asked.”

If you answered “yes” to the previous question, what is the reason behind your
decision to convert items in your library collections to more accessible formats?

A survey multiple-choice question allowed librarian respondents who answered “yes” to
the previous question to choose as many options as they felt applied to them regarding their
reasons for converting their library collections. The analysis presented in Table 41 shows that
34% of responding librarians reported their reason for collection conversions to be a desire to
improve their services for patrons. Another 23% considered the flexibility of having multiple
formats, while 15% converted at least partly to populate their online collections (see Table 41).

Further analysis presented in Table 42 revealed that, of public libraries that convert their
collections for their patrons with disabilities, a majority (58%) perceived the concept of their
collections’ conversion to alternate formats as a means to better serving their community’s
patrons. However, 50% of academic libraries that reported converting their collections did not
consider the conversions to alternate formats to be so important for their patrons; but rather, they
explained these conversions as a way to reduce printing costs.

Into what formats do you convert your library’s collection items?
Librarians were asked to specify into what kinds of formats their libraries converted

collection items. This was again a survey question allowing more than one response from the
librarians. Therefore, the percentages of responses shown on Table 44 below total greater than
100%. A sizeable 58% of responses from librarians reported that their library converts collection
items into image files. Additionally, 55% of them reported converting their library’s items into
108

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
electronic book formats. These two categories of formats were the most prominent ones reported
in this survey as being used by libraries in presenting alternative formatted information for their
patrons use (see Table 43).

Percentages in Table 44 below are based on the total number of responses for each kind
of alternative format. In Table 44, the largest number of responses presented by this survey
concerning alternative formats was from public libraries. Further, 30% of librarians in special
libraries reported using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) as a means of presenting
information in an alternative format for disabled patrons. This result fits well into the narrative
which claims that special libraries make additional efforts to ensure their resources are readily
available for special needs patrons in alternative formats. Additionally, survey responses
indicated that 53% of reporting libraries that employed image files were public libraries and 21%
of them were special libraries (see Table 44).

How would you rate the following listed library services at your library?
Librarians and veterans were both asked to rate various listed library services at their

libraries. For this question, some survey respondents did not provide ratings for every listed type
of library service. Therefore, there are slight variations, and in one case a major variation, in the
number of responses on which the percentages are based. Both librarian and veteran responses
to questions were summarized and are given in Tables 45, 46, and 47.
In Table 45, book borrowing was reported as excellent by 57% of veteran respondents
and 68% of librarian respondents. However, notable was the difference in views regarding
renewal services with 72% of surveyed librarians but only 48% of surveyed veterans rating them
as excellent. Another imbalance or disconnection seemed to occur when 52% of librarians
surveyed considered book delivery to be excellent while only 29% of veterans surveyed
considered book delivery to be excellent (see Table 45). Assistance with retrieving books from

110

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
shelves was considered “good” by 41% of veteran responders, and 35% of veteran responders
rated assistance with making room reservations as “good.”

How accessible are these listed resources in your library?
Both librarians and veterans were asked to rate the accessibility of listed library

resources. As seen in Table 46, an extremely high number of librarians and veterans considered
library resources to be overall very accessible. Microfiche was the exception with 27% of both
librarians surveyed and veterans surveyed reporting that these files were somewhat inaccessible
or inaccessible. Also, 25% of responding librarians reported that they were not sure whether
these microfiche files were accessible or not. Among the resources that responding veterans
considered very accessible or accessible were: library websites (82%), periodicals (76%), audio
books (75%), e-books (78%), and books (89%). Responding librarians believed that the
following resources were very accessible or accessible: books (87%), e-books (92%), audio
books (89%), electronic journals (77%), and alternative media (90%). Once more, as shown in
Table 46, there is a fairly small variation in the number of survey responses received on different
parts of this question.

How often are there barriers connected to these listed concerns at your library?

The survey asked veterans and librarians to judge how often barriers were encountered at
their libraries in connection with a list of library-related concerns. From the information
presented in Table 47, 64% of veterans surveyed identified the problem of parking as an issue
even though 45% of librarians surveyed said that parking was not an issue for disabled patrons.
113

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
Another disconnection was the 49% of respondent disabled veterans that identified the problem
of signage as a major issue while 51% of respondent librarians did not consider this as an issue
for patrons.
Librarians and disabled veterans in the survey seemed to find common ground
concerning access to bookshelves. However, this common ground was not considered to be
positive because both 57% of librarian respondents and 57% of veteran respondents believed
barriers to reaching bookshelves were an issue in their library. Surveyed librarians and veterans
tended to have a split in their perceptions about barriers to study space. Of veterans who
participated in this survey, 54% concluded that it was an issue to navigate the study area while
61% of participating librarians did not agree that this was a problem. This pattern of
disconnection was also noticeable with perceptions about barriers related to lighting, ramps,
elevators, stairs, emergency evacuation routes, restrooms, pictogram signs, water fountains,
computer stations, information desks, and circulation desks (see Table 47).

What types of information do veterans seek at your library?
Veterans had been asked in their survey about what categories of information, broken

into sub-categories, they sought in libraries. Now, librarians were asked what categories and
sub-categories of information they thought veterans sought in their library. Back in Table 28,
information about legal matters, faith, and current awareness were reported to be the least sought
after sub-categories of information by veteran respondents when they visited libraries. For
general and health-related information, these were reported by veteran respondents to each be

115

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
14% of what they sought at libraries (see now also Table 48). Comparatively, responses from
the librarians who were surveyed showed their perception that 15% of veterans at their libraries
sought information related to employment and that the faith sub-category was the least sought
after by veterans.

Perceptions of Librarians of Assistive Services

5.6.1

How would you rate the quality of assistive services for disabled patrons at your library?
Librarians were asked to judge the quality of assistive services for disabled patrons at the

library where they work. As seen in Table 49 below, 88% of librarians attested that their
assistive services for disabled patrons were very good or good while 12% rated their services for
the disabled as poor or very poor. The 88% of veterans in the veterans’ survey who reported that
116

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
they have always or often achieved their goals when they have visited libraries (see Table 53
ahead) matches well with the 88% of librarians in the librarians’ survey here who rated the
quality of their assistive services for disabled patrons to be very good or good.

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
5.6.2

How would you rate the overall quality of the categories of services listed for disabled
patrons at your library?

For this study, assistive services in the library were grouped under three major categories:
library services, physical accommodations, and digital access. A request was made on both the
veterans’ survey and on the librarians’ survey for a rating of overall quality of services for
disabled patrons in these three major categories. One librarian respondent skipped providing an
answer in the first category but did give answers for the second and third categories. This
explains the slight discrepancy in the number of responses from librarians.
There is somewhat of an alignment in the perceptions of librarians with the perceptions of
veterans regarding library services. Table 51 below shows that 43% of veteran survey
respondents rated library services as “excellent” for people with disabilities at the libraries which
they use, and 47% of surveyed librarians thought that these library services at their own libraries
were “good.” Further, 43% of librarians and 38% of veterans considered the physical
accommodations for disabled people at their own libraries to be “good.” This was also the trend
for the ratings of “good” in the digital access category with 45% and 39% of surveyed librarians
and veterans, respectively.

Veterans’ Perceptions of Assistive Services
Veterans were asked to rate assistive services like the librarians had been asked to do.

However, in the veteran survey, both open-ended questions and other questions were used to
ascertain the quality of these services and to ascertain how veterans perceived assistive services
offered in libraries. In order to avoid replication of what was presented in Table 51, the reported
perceptions of veterans of assistive services were not explained until this section.
The data shown in Table 52 below indicates that 15%, 29%, and 22% of veterans
surveyed considered library services, physical accommodations, and digital access, respectively,
to be either fair or poor. Among veteran survey participants who considered physical
accommodations to be fair or poor, Table 47 presented a breakdown of the actual physical
features that too often were considered to have barriers for disabled people. In Table 47, the top
five physical accommodation challenges for veterans that visited libraries were parking (41%),
study space (35%), access to bookshelves (34%), doors (34%), and access to restrooms (34%).
In this context, responses from veterans in Table 47 that chose “always” and “often” were
grouped as “poor” physical accommodations.
Library services that were rated fair or poor by some of the veterans in this study
included: room reservation process (26%), printing (26%), book delivery process (25%), and
assistance getting books from the shelves (22%) (refer back to Table 45). Digital access barriers

119

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
faced by responding veterans, as presented back in Table 46, were mostly to do with microfiche
(27%), and electronic equipment (28%).

Do you think that you have accomplished your goals when you have visited a library?
Veterans in the survey were asked how often they have achieved their goals when they

have visited a library. It was fascinating to learn that 88% of survey respondent veterans
believed that they usually have achieved their goals (those indicating always or often) during
their library visit. Only 10% reported not meeting their library visit goals (those indicating
seldom or never), and 2% of the veterans surveyed said that they were unsure (see Table 53).

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
6. Discussion
As a way of reintegrating into civilian life, disabled veterans will likely visit libraries.
The interactions of disabled veterans with librarians when seeking information in libraries can be
informed from the application and evaluation of the Veteran, Library, Tasks, and Tools (VLTT)
model that was developed in this study. Implications from using the logical flow of the new
Veteran, Library, Tasks, and Tools (VLTT) model contribute to understanding the reintegration
of disabled veterans to civilian life and to achieving their career goals. With the data provided
from this study, the interactions and assistive services necessary for disabled veterans can be
better understood and more effectively met with library services as they return home from war
and transition back into civilian life. Since libraries are considered to be information centers, it
is important that libraries address the issues of access and support to meet disabled veterans’
critical needs. In the VLTT model, libraries are seen as the intermediaries between the disabled
veterans, the tasks to be completed, and the assistive tools. The perceptions of library services
by both disabled veterans and librarians were compared to identify any possible connections or
disconnections with a goal of better severing disabled veterans in the library.

6.1 Veteran, Library, Tasks, and Tools (VLTT) Model
The VLTT theoretical model that was used in this study is adapted from the SETT model
which was originally applied in the education curriculum for students having difficulty in
completing a task (see Chapter 3). This study expanded the SETT model to engage the core
concepts in library practice. The VLTT model proposes that the library acts as a facilitator in
veterans’ information needs by providing resources and assistive tools. Specifically, the VLTT
model seeks to explain how the disabled veterans’ constraints and disability types, the tasks that

122

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
the disabled veterans want to complete or the information needs they want met, and the assistive
technology available in the library to help disabled veterans complete their tasks or meet their
information needs (see Figure 6). This study explored interactions between disabled veterans
and librarians.
The constructs for disabled veterans in the VLTT model were developed and
operationalized in a manner that allowed specific questions to be directed at disabled veterans
and at librarians. With the answers to these questions, librarians can better understand veterans’
disability types, age groups, in which wars veterans fought, individualized perceptions of
technology, and the different assistive tools and systems tried in the past. Since the library
played the role of the intermediary between all the other elements in the VLTT model, the library
element of the model was used to evaluate the digital and physical access concerns of disabled
veterans when they visit a library. The library component was explored for issues of access,
open environment, and integration of systems that support library visits of disabled veterans.
Considerations of physical and logical arrangements of resources and resource types were also
factored into the library construct to discover any connections or disconnections in the
perceptions of librarians and disabled veterans concerning these specific considerations. In
addition, the library construct includes assistive services and marketing of library services as a
means of promoting engagement of disabled veterans in their transition to civilian life.

The following discussion will be subdivided into the different elements of the VLTT
model.

6.1.1

Disabled Veterans
In the Veteran, Library, Tasks, and Tools (VLTT) model, the veteran population in this

study is largely composed of younger people within the age group of 18 to 45 years. Since
members of the younger generation have different information seeking behaviors in terms of
style, interactivity, and perceptions, it becomes imperative for librarians to understand this
unique group of disabled veterans (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2005). As the number of veterans
continues to rise (Veterans Inc., 2010), it is expected that the number of military personnel
returning to civilian life will increase. Many of the disabled veterans have a hearing disability
(52%), an ambulatory disability (36%), or a mental disability (33%) like Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD). As a result of disabling conditions, disabled veterans will need assistive tools
like communication aids, hearing aids, mobility aids, and vision aids when they come to visit
libraries.
124

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
It seems evident in the disability types represented in this study that hearing disabilities
could be the result of the constant loud pounding of heavy artillery fire at battlefronts.
Consequently, communication aids and hearing aids are two assistive tools frequently used by
veterans. Disabilities among veterans were reported to have begun mostly during years of active
service. However, some veterans had pre-existing disabilities which became worsened during
military services.
This study produced substantial evidence that more than half of the disabled veterans
fought in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of these, 66% are now within the age group of 18 to
45 years. This could indicate that many of these veterans may want to further their education by
going back to college (Shackelford, 2009), or by learning a skill, or by becoming successful
“vetrepreneurs” (Evans, 2012; Hoppenfeld et al., 2013). Among the different disability types
prominent among veterans presented in this study, learning disabilities and self-care disabilities
were the lowest. This implies that most of these disabled veterans do not have neurological
problems which could interfere with their basic learning, organization, planning, and retention
ability. It might then be inferred that these disabled veterans’ propensity to learn has become
even better established because they do not require the kinds of assistive tools that support the
most basic fundamentals of learning. The two disability types of learning (7%) and self-care
(6%) were the least reported of all disability types requiring assistive tools. Considering the
physical disabilities of many of these veterans and their high potential for learning and
knowledge acquisition, it might be expected that a majority will consider returning to school to
obtain some type of vocational training or higher degrees.

125

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
6.1.2

Tasks
Veterans will be visiting libraries to seek information specific to accomplishing different

tasks or to becoming informed in various aspects of life (Guder & Booth, 2012; Junus & Booth,
2012; Willis, 2012). It was initially projected that work-related information such as employment
and education would be the most sought-after information by disabled veterans. However, the
results of this study found that health information and general study information were most
sought by these disabled veterans. Health information can include understanding how to access
health benefits available to disabled veterans or trying to access help in coping with a particular
disability. Even though it seemed very reasonable to think that employment information would
top the list for this group of disabled veterans, there were other information types in which
disabled veterans tended to be more interested when they visit libraries. Among those types were
general study and recreational information. This could imply that disabled veterans are very
interested in finding recreational activities close to them, especially those facilities that can help
veterans cope with their disabilities.
This study found that 20% of disabled veterans are interested in educational or workrelated information while 33% were interested in military resources or mission-related
information. Therefore, it is crucial that an appropriate level attention to library services and
collections be focused on access to these subject areas, especially employment information as it
seems to be one of the most difficult information seeking processes for disabled veterans. The
unemployment rate among veterans has been ticking upward according to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. This agency reported that the veteran unemployment rate is now 4.7% (2016).
Unemployment can contribute to the high influx of disabled veterans visiting libraries at least
once a week to seek assistance in finding jobs or in career development. The odds against

126

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
disabled veterans successfully competing for jobs are sometimes great. Thus, the related burden
of assistive services in libraries can be expected to rise.
The information seeking with which disabled veterans seem to have the greatest difficulty
is predominantly employment-related and work-related information. Since this is indeed the
case, disabled veterans will be among those who require the support of librarians for tutoring,
resume workshops, career assessments, career counseling, and instructional sessions. Library
staff members need to become familiar with employment information which often also is
presented to disabled veterans as they search for information in this category. Librarians from
different types of libraries in this study expressed the common concern that most disabled
veterans have difficulties when hunting for jobs. However, librarians can also expect veterans to
visit the library to read just for pleasure and to search for health-related resources to enable them
to cope with the disabling conditions with which they now live due to injuries they sustained
during or after wars.
The elements of support required by disabled veterans were categorized into two major
types in this study – physical support and computer support. Helping to get books from shelves
and assisting with computer-specific problems were the two most significant needs reported by
disabled veterans among the physical support and the computer support types, respectively. The
physical needs reported gave a signal that mobility disabilities should be given attention in
libraries. Within the library space, the height of chairs and tables, the width of walkthroughs
between shelves, and the positioning of computers all affect how disabled veterans are able to
complete tasks in a library. According to the findings of this study, there is evidence that
disabled veterans will sometimes need help reaching a particular website or accessing a specific
electronic database to complete a task. In some cases, visually disabled veterans could have

127

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
challenges when opening or downloading files from databases. When disabled veterans visit
libraries, a certain number of them may require assistance in navigating computer databases
which list available job positions and in searching for employment opportunities in stacks of
newspapers on shelves.

6.1.3 Library
Libraries should identify the needs of their communities through effective planning and
assessment to effectively serve the diversity of populations (Coleman, 2011; Riley, 2012).
Libraries are committed to ensuring a more accessible library spaces and to provide access to
information (Booth, 2012a). However, this study shows that the gulf between disabled veterans
expectations of accessible library resources and services and the realities of these actually found
in libraries has grown wider than thought. Inadequate assistance from library staff and the lack
of navigational guides to support disabled veterans when they use libraries were reported by
large numbers of disabled veterans. This becomes more crucial considering that large
percentages (48% regarding inadequate assistance and 63% regarding lack of navigational
guides) of the disabled veterans who reported these gaps were daily to weekly library users.
Resources like books, e-books, periodicals, and electronic databases within libraries were highly
rated as being easily accessible by disabled veterans. This denotes that some effort has been
made in recent times to adhere to accessibility standards in many libraries. However, it
important to note that some disabled veterans still encounter difficulties in accessing some
resource materials in libraries such as microfilms (29%), electronic databases (20%), and audio
books (18%). This might be a reflection of those libraries which do not convert their collections
into more accessible formats. In this study, 76% of public libraries, 50% of school libraries, 33%

128

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
of special libraries, and 26% of academic libraries admitted that they do not convert their
collections into accessible formats. Within library spaces, there are needs to substantially
improve physical support, assistive technologies, and assistive services so as to better
accommodate disabled veterans. Factors such as the availability of adjustable seats, voice
recognition software, reading aids, and modernized elevators which can accommodate disabled
veterans who arrive to library spaces, all need to be reviewed. Libraries with already existing
assistive tools and services should evaluate these tools and services for functionality and
compatibility in serving all visiting disabled veterans. Library staff members must be
responsible for ensuring that all needed support is available for disabled patrons when they visit
the library for any information seeking tasks (Hopkins, 2004).
Although a large percentage of veteran survey respondents asserted that the library
environment gave them sufficient access to assistive devices (see Section 5.2.3), there were
complaints of non-functionality (34%), poor compatibility (27%), and inadequate assistance
(27%) in using these devices. The three complaint factors raised concerns about the lack of
efficiency of these tools. Non-functional devices, as explained by disabled veterans, can be
defined by the disparity between what the assistive tools in a library are doing compared to what
those tools should be doing. Compatibility issues likely have more to do with the platform on
which most libraries run their software applications. In some cases, some audio books and
eBooks might work with an iOS app and not with an Android app. Furthermore, disabled
veterans in this study who complained about the issues of compatibility issues (63%), nonfunctional devices (51%), and inadequate assistance (48%) were mostly frequent library users.
In order for libraries to effectively cater to more disabled veterans adjusting to civilian life, these

129

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
three issues needed to be reviewed. Within library spaces, the lack of navigational guides is also
a known problem listed by disabled veterans.
Libraries are mandated by the ADA to make accommodations for disabled people in
libraries. Yet it might be highly beneficial if libraries were to consider the creation and
implementation of written policies, specific to public, school, and academic libraries, for services
to disabled veterans. Over 87% of public librarians who responded to their survey as a part of
this study reported that they do not currently have a specific written standard on how to provide
services to any kind of disabled patrons. To make libraries more accessible and usable for all
patrons, especially disabled veterans, effective planning is required. Policies need to be in place,
assistive services should be promptly available to disabled patrons, and access to physical and
digital resources must be prepared (Burgstahler, 2012). Findings in the current study showed
that assistive services and physical accommodations in libraries are still lacking in some areas.
About 15% of disabled veterans rated library services as poor while 29% of disabled veterans
considered physical accommodations as poor. Creamer (2007) illustrated the need for
standardization of resources in multiple accessible formats and of alternative materials in
libraries. Therefore, libraries should anticipate a wide range of users and not wait to just convert
resources based on specific requests alone. Although disabled veterans considered most
resources like books, eBooks, audio books, electronic journals, websites, electronic databases,
and electronic equipment to be accessible, they still encountered physical barriers in terms of
lighting, ramps, elevators, stairs, emergency evacuation routes, restrooms, pictogram signs, water
fountains, computer stations, information desks, and circulation desks.

130

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
6.1.4

Assistive Tools
Disabled veterans with physical disabilities depend on assistive tools such as mobility

aids and communication aids for their daily life. The literature that has focused on disabled
library patrons reveals that disabled library users often consider library assistive tools as either
irrelevant or too obsolete (Burke, 2009; Junus & Booth, 2012). This finding aligns with results
of this study because a large percentage of participant veterans considered most assistive tools in
the library to be nonfunctional, incompatible, and/or poorly designed. Assistive tools used by
disabled veterans that visit libraries in this study were mostly communication aids and hearing
aids, which gives some insight into the disability types prominent among this study’s disabled
veterans. Assistive tools like “MyVoice” which help people with speech and language disability
speak using an app may be needed to connect with disabled veterans who have communication
disabilities. Also, telecoil receivers for those with hearing loss need to be available in libraries
for these veterans. The disabled veterans with learning disabilities should have access to
computers dedicated to text to speech capability with the necessary software installed on those
computers in libraries. Software with Optical Character Recognition (OCR), such as those
offered by Don Johnston Inc. and Kurzweil, are needed in libraries that do not proactively
convert to accessible formats. Powered wheelchairs and magnifying glasses are needed for
disabled veterans with mobility and vision disabilities. As technology advances, the nature of
information seeking by disabled veterans has also become dynamic and more complex. Thus,
libraries need to be innovative in embracing newly developed assistive tools with higher
capabilities that can improve the overall productivity of veterans in libraries.
This study showed that disabled veterans will be likely to request additional assistive
tools when they visit libraries. Libraries can expect to see a higher level of requisitions for

131

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
reading aids, mobility aids, and computer access aids. This is because the veterans who depend
on these specific tools and who are also categorized as “frequent” visitors (meaning that they
visit a library at least once a week) were reported to be greater in number than other groups of
disabled veteran library users. This current study’s findings parallel the findings of a previous
study on the need to support disabled patrons visiting libraries (Hopkins, 2004). Across the
different disability types, disabled veterans that frequent the library at least weekly used more
communication aids, hearing aids, daily living aids, and mobility aids as compared to other
assistive tools. Specifically, about six in ten (62%) of the disabled veterans who use
communication aids were frequent library visitors, and 63% of the disabled veterans who had
learning disabilities still visited a library at least weekly. This describes a community of disabled
veterans that are willingness to learn as a way of reintegrating to civilian life.

6.2 Implications for Practice
The findings of this study revealed that disabled veterans returning to civilian life will
likely visit libraries to get needed support for their information seeking. Therefore, most of the
disabled veterans could possibly benefit from targeted instructional sessions and career
development training workshops in the library.
An outreach services could be adopted as a method of engaging and establishing a
connection between disabled veterans and a library. The strategy should carry over to the
selection of assistive services for disabled veterans and should be entirely veteran-driven.
Disabled veterans must be an important focus of the planned, long-term strategy and outreach of
libraries services. Additionally, the findings of this study indicate that some number of disabled
veterans will be looking to libraries for career development, training, resume writing, and

132

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
employment searches. With the ongoing advances in technology, social networks, blogs, and
digital or virtualized public spaces can be employed by libraries to engage disabled veterans with
a common goal of getting tasks completed, and conduits for disseminating support services.
Libraries can use this as a starting point to engage with their veteran population and to determine
the actual needs of their disabled veterans.
Within the library space and context, assistive support services can also be defined as
every effort, in terms of programs, workshops, or seminars, designed to support disabled patrons
in their assistive tools selection or tasks completion process. In this study, instructional sessions
were considered part of the strategy. It was somewhat disappointing to learn that many disabled
veterans do not attend these sessions. On the other hand, this study showed that those veterans
who did frequently attend the sessions, and possibly also the older veterans, found these
instructional sessions very helpful. Due to this outcome, there is encouragement for libraries to
strengthen these instructional programs through effective outreach and marketing to ensure that
more disabled veterans are reached. Additionally, a needs analysis and investigation should be
completed to include infrequent visitors. Corresponding training designed specifically to meet
essentials for disabled veterans is necessary. This approach is supported by scholars in LIS as an
assessment strategy (Irvall & Nielsen, 2005; Wooden, 2006; Coleman, 2011; Riley, 2012).
Disabled veterans listed librarians’ conduct and method of teaching as the major reasons why
they would not attend instructional sessions. This raises concern that there must be something
missing in the conduct, the style, and/or the method of service delivery provided by librarians.
While evaluating and partnering with disabled veterans, librarians must strive to work in a more
collaborative way enabling veterans to complete their tasks. The aspects of communication,
duration, and content of instructional sessions received negative feedback from some of the

133

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
surveyed disabled veterans. The main goal of these library instructional sessions should be to
effectively communicate with disabled patrons, and lengthy sessions should be avoided.
In terms of physically-based considerations of technology in libraries, many returning
veterans will require certain types of assistive tools to effectively transition back into civilian
life. In libraries especially, communication aids, hearing aids, and reading aids will be required
to cater to the special needs of disabled veterans. Open access within the physical library
environment will also be essential. Access to library resources in all forms of physical and
digital formats can be expected to be in high demand among disabled veterans.
Perceptions of library services were subdivided into four major categories: library
services, physical accommodations, digital access, and assistive support services. From this
study, there is evidence indicating that both librarians and veterans agree by rating library
services fairly well. Important to note, however, is that this rating of library services could be
more for generic services and not for services specific to disabled patrons. Based on veteran
perceptions, the results of this study indicate a need for libraries to redouble their efforts in
improving renewal services and book delivery services. Also, more accessibility to bookshelves
was an issue identified for major improvement. Libraries should organize books and shelve
them in a manner where they are accessible to all patrons, including disabled veterans. As
previously mentioned, assistive support services within libraries should be reviewed to determine
the demands of veterans.
Veterans’ reported perceptions of library microfilm collections show that a substantial
percentage of disabled veterans do not necessarily regard microfilms to be accessible. These
veterans may often prefer library resources in alternative electronic versions and not necessarily
in bound paper books. Therefore, the perceptions of disabled veterans in judging library

134

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
resources may be directly related more to the format of the resources and somewhat less to their
availability. Disabled veterans use of other services, such as assistance with reserving rooms,
assistance with research, and book delivery, indicate that these services reduce downtime and
waiting periods.
Besides the above identified library service barriers, disabled veterans mentioned some
additional challenges with the physical setup and arrangement of their library’s space. There
appeared to be a sharp disconnect in perceptions between the disabled veterans and the librarians
regarding accessibility within and around library spaces. In the results presented earlier, 76% of
librarians claimed that lighting was never or rarely a problem for disabled veterans, while 33% of
disabled veterans pointed out that lighting was an issue. This same type of disconnection was
also found with the subject of parking when 41% of disabled veterans listed parking as an issue
while 47% of librarians did not see parking as a problem for the veterans. These types of
disconnections need to be revisited and reconsidered by library administrators to include the
veteran viewpoints.
One major objective of emphasis in this study was for library staff to ensure that disabled
veterans always achieve their goals during library visits. When tasks are completed, goals are
considered to have been achieved. Assistive support services for disabled veterans in libraries
should be a process which has been pretested for effectiveness with a minimum need for extra
intervention or additional course.

6.3 Limitations of This Study
The study provides crucial information about the information needs and the expectations
of disabled veterans when they visit libraries. However, the sample collected for the veterans’
135

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
survey was widely distributed but the librarians’ sample seems to be more localized (see
Appendix F & G). Although this disconnect is expected to have low probability of geographic
disparity that can impact the results. Self-reporting is another limitation which could influence
disabled veterans’ answer choices. The tone of the questions may have effect on the selection of
answers for the rating scales and sematic differential question types. Disabled veterans may also
over report their experiences which could result to social desirability bias.

6.4 Further Studies

The future work includes expanding the VLTT model to include key elements of library
services that pertains to the top tasks that disabled veterans often come to complete in the library.
Additional analysis of data gathered in this study could produce new insights that will lead to the
development of new model with elements pertaining to the disabled veterans and library. A case
study analysis on some selected libraries located in military bases could produce a stronger
outcome using the VLTT model.
Suggestion for further studies include those that will explore how disabled veterans are
connected to social network sites and what particular skill sets have most helped disabled
veterans in recent times in securing jobs or placements. In the future, it might be interesting to
explore instructional sessions or methods of delivery that can yield a high turnout of veteran
participation. Online sessions might be the next largely effective method of delivering or
marketing assistive services for disabled veterans since they are mostly categorized as the

136

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
younger age group. This will significantly take care of the issues of physical accommodation and
encourage more participation.

6.5 Conclusion
This study defines a new theoretical model of interaction between disabled veterans,
libraries, information seeking tasks, and assistive technologies. The VLTT model provides a
holistic understanding of the diverse information needs and struggles of disabled veterans
returning to civilian life and how libraries can support or hinder the veterans’ access to
information. This study helped identify areas of improvements in the support of veterans’
information seeking within the library environment. The objective of this research was to
explore the efficiency of assistive services, access to both physical and digital resources, and the
current status of physical accommodations within libraries. This study does contribute to the
claim for an emerging scholarly field as was claimed by the research of Brodsky and Pencek
(2014). The VLTT model developed in this dissertation contribute to the larger body of research
on disabled veterans and to future similar research.
The interdisciplinary nature of the library and information science discipline allows it to
borrow concepts and ideas from other disciplines like education and computer science. It also
allows problems to be solved using a multilevel approach since information problems are
complex and multifaceted. Understanding all of the areas of concern for challenges will help to
better solve problems and to understand what future concerns might arise. Summarily, librarians
must comprehend the needs of disabled veterans and what approach will be most helpful to
support this unique group of information seekers. Therefore, research studies on understanding
the patterns of information seeking of disabled veterans are worthy of review by library

137

The Veteran, Library, Tasks and Tools Framework
administrators. These studies should be seriously considered by librarians to enable them to
connect with and to contribute meaningfully to the lives of these active, yet disabled, veterans.

Services for Disabled Veterans in the Library

You are invited to participate in a research study that analyses the difference in veterans and
librarians’ perception of library services. As the number of disabled veterans have increased
significantly over the past ten years, services to disabled veterans have become more important.
The main objective of this study is to analyze the barriers and challenging tasks that disabled
veterans face in efforts to be actively involved in the library space, or environment, and to
illuminate the pathways that librarians could follow to satisfy veterans’ information need.
This survey should take 15 minutes to complete.
Every effort will be made to keep confidential all research records that identify you to the extent
allowed by law. No personal or identifying information will be stored. All result will be presented
in aggregated formats further obscuring any individual response. Please be aware, while we make
every effort to safe guard your data once received from the online survey/data gathering company,
given the nature of online surveys, as with anything involving the Internet, we can never guarantee
the confidentiality of the data while still on the survey/data gathering company’s servers, or while
en route to either them or us.
This survey has no more risk than in everyday life. There are no costs to completing the survey.
There are no rewards to participating. This research is not funded by any government agency and
has no affiliation with any department or branch of the U.S. government or any other government.
The results will be used in academic publications and will not be shared with any government.
This study is being conducted by Temidayo Olorunfemi, a PhD student at Dominican University.
If you have any questions about participating in this research, please contact the student researcher
at olortemi@my.dom.edu, or the supervising faculty member, Dr. Stacy Kowalczyk, at
skowalczyk@dom.edu. If you have any questions about your rights as a research participant,
contact the Dominican University IRB Administrator via email at irbadministrator@dom.edu or
via telephone at (708) 524-6914.
