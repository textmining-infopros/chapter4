Abstract
Open Educational Resources (OERs) could provide relief for common issues related to
the digital divide, particularly issues related to appropriate digital content for classroom
use, teacher discomfort using digital content, and strategies for moving teachers to
sustained digital content use. Librarians--already leaders in finding and sharing
authoritative digital resources, familiar with copyright and Creative Commons licenses,
and accustomed to using technology to deliver content--should lead in the creation,
selection, and implementation of continuing education OERs, particularly literacy-related
OERs. This research project will illustrate the potential for librarians in creating OER
content that trains K-12 teachers in relaying eHealth literacy competencies for
adolescents. It will design a prototype for an open education resource that illustrates how
librarian-teacher collaborations can lead to the creation of tools that alleviate three of the
issues highlighted in the 2016 State of America’s Libraries Report: 1. difficulty locating
appropriate digital content for classroom use, 2. teacher discomfort using digital content,
and 3. unclear strategies for moving teachers to sustained digital content use in the
classroom.

Chapter 1: eHealth Literacy, the Digital Divide, and OERs

The State of America’s Libraries
eHealth literacy--a person’s ability to find, evaluate, and apply health information
from digital sources-- directly influences the success in which one is able to access health
information, learn about disease prevention and health promotion, follow health care
regiments, and communicate health messages with other people. When introduced in
early adolescence, eHealth literacy competencies can have a life-long influence on
informed health decision-making. In K-12 education, librarians have traditionally
collaborated with teachers to provide students with information literacy training and often
take the lead in integrating digital resources. They support teachers, administrators, and
students in the training, resource management, and strategic outreach related to
introducing new educational technologies. However, as information has shifted to
become more electronically available, evidence shows that literacy education has
struggled to keep up. The 2016 State of America’s Libraries Report notes significant
increases, between 2010 and 2015, in the percentage of librarians experiencing
challenges supporting the digital content needed to teach literacy skills ("School
Libraries," 2016). These digital divide experiences include insufficient internet access,
lack of student access to technology at school, difficulty locating appropriate digital
content for classroom use, teacher discomfort using digital content, and unclear strategies
for moving teachers to sustained digital content use in the classroom.
Open Educational Resources (OERs) could provide relief for common issues
related to the digital divide, particularly issues related to appropriate digital content for
classroom use, teacher discomfort using digital content, and strategies for moving teacher
to sustained digital content use. Librarians—already leaders in finding and sharing
authoritative digital resources, familiar with copyright and Creative Commons licenses,
and accustomed to using technology to deliver content—should lead in the creation,
selection, and implementation of continuing education OERs, particularly literacy-related
OERs.

The Digital Divide
Digital divide research reveals disparities in eHealth literacy competencies. These
issues are complicated in rural areas that experience additional barriers such as limited
internet access and limited healthcare services (Paek, 2010). Several studies suggest that
behavioral interventions that use innovative multimedia technology work well when
designing health informatics tools for adolescent use. Such interventions can be used to
teach and improve eHealth literacy (Roseman, Riddell, & Haynes, 2011). If these
behavioral interventions could be designed for classrooms with limited internet access
and across a range of platforms--desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones-- they would
offer a reliable, interactive teaching platform for middle and high school health teachers,
especially those in rural and low-income areas.
Access to computers, the internet, and mobile technologies in homes and schools
has increased exponentially in recent years. A 2013 report from the U.S. Census Bureau
found that nearly 90% of adolescents use the Internet, with computer usage and
communications tools steadily rising; 97% of U.S. schools have computers, and 90% of
those computers have internet access. In 2011, about ¾ of U.S. households had
computers (File, 2013). In the early 2000s a digital divide existed, driven by
socioeconomic status, race, area rurality, and age but as technology became more
affordable and internet access more widespread, the divide was expected to close. Current
research suggests that has not been the case and that, particularly amongst adolescents,
with whom significant differences in digital literacy exist based on socioeconomic status,
race, and gender (Ritzhaupt, Feng, Dawson, & Barron, 2013).
Communication technologies, especially mobile technologies, can be useful
teaching tools for reaching adolescents and their prevalence has grown in the past five
years, alleviating such issues as tobacco use, the transmission of sexually transmitted
diseases, alcohol abuse, and teen pregnancy. These interventions have the advantages of
quickly and reliably providing effective, standardized, and personalized information yet
they remain underutilized in K-12 education, though they could be particularly impactful
in middle and high school health education (Manganello & Sojka, 2016).

This research project will illustrate the potential for librarians in using OERs to
create digital content that trains K-12 teachers in relaying eHealth literacy competencies
for adolescents. It will design a prototype for an open education resource that illustrates
how librarian-teacher collaborations can lead to the creation of such tools to alleviate
three of the issues highlighted in the 2016 State of America’s Libraries Report: 1.
difficulty locating appropriate digital content for classroom use, 2. teacher discomfort
using digital content, and 3. unclear strategies for moving teachers to sustained digital
content use in the classroom. This literature review seeks to answer two questions: 1. Are
open education resources (OERs) an effective means for teacher training and 2. How can
librarians engage teachers in creating eHealth literacy-related OER tools and
interventions?You can find the style menu in Word 2007 by clicking on the Home tab on
the standard toolbar; Styles is one of the choices you will see. Click on the arrow icon on
the right side of the Styles bar, and the drop-down menu of styles will appear. In Word
2003, look in the upper left corner of your screen, on the formatting toolbar, for the dropdown style menu.
Open Education Resources (OERs)
Open Education Resources (OERs) became popularized after schools began
adopting the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in 2013, as a means to develop and
disseminate free online training content and to provide teachers with standards-based
material for CCSS-aligned instruction. OERs, as defined at a 2002 UNESCO Forum,
serve as the “technology-enabled open provision of educational resources for
consultation, use, and adaptation by a community of users for non-commercial purposes”.
Digital libraries of OERs are available on the public domain and can include resources
such as open access textbooks, videos, podcasts, teacher’s guides, continuing education
opportunities, and lesson plans. OERs are a part of the Open Access movement and help
make educational resources more accessible, affordable, and available than traditional,
commercially-produced materials. They typically use Creative Commons licenses to
allow for royalty-free, license-free access to materials. (Welz, 2017)

The aim of the proposed OER project is to produce an eHealth literacy OER
training course that librarians can use to train teachers in either distance, face-to-face, or
hybrid learning environments. This pilot model is intended to be freely adapted and
revised. Teachers who have completed the pilot course will learn to create eHealth
literacy content specifically for their student audiences. To make it more accessible for
audiences with limited internet access, training material will be available for download as
a PDF document for printing and as a Word Document to encourage adaptation. It will
consist of 4 units that span a timeline of 1 week/unit and the entire course can be
completed in four weeks.
OER Growth and Policy Support. The potential for OERs in revolutionizing
access to educational resources has been recognized across local, state, and federal
arenas. OERs, already becoming popular in 2013 with local school districts recognizing
their potential to provide access to free, shareable instructional content, gained more
traction in 2015 with the Obama administration’s bipartisan passage of the Every Student
Succeeds Act, P.L. 114-95 (ESSA). ESSA permits states and local education agencies to
dedicate grant money to OER technologies and provides OER funding with Student
Support and Academic Enrichment Grants. In 2016, additional policy regulations
required that all new intellectual property developed with federal grants from the U.S.
Department of Education be freely available under an open license (Welz, 2017).
K-12 school districts across a number of U.S. states have developed control
policies that guide teachers and administrators in the adoption and implementation of
OERs by explaining advantages, exploring implementation strategies, and demonstrating
exemplary OER examples. Considerations are being given for how OERs should
accommodate special needs students and how OERs can provide professional
development activities for teachers (Welz, 2017).
Evaluating OERs. A five-dimensional analysis could be used to evaluate the
proposed OER (Joyce, 2007):
1. Scope. On what disciplines, education levels, and intended audiences does the
OER project focus? Is the focus narrow or broad? A narrow focus provides material for
© 2017 McGowan, Bethany

A Collaborative Approach to Improving Adolescent eHealth Literacy

5

one specific topic or subject area, while a broad focus provides material suitable for a
range of topics.
2. Authorship. Was the OER created by a single author, or through a collaborative
effort?
3. Licensing. Does the OER license allow it to be combined with other OER
materials or to be used in other contexts?
4. Granularity. What is the resource size? The smaller a resource is, the more
granular it is.
5. Teaching Duration. How much teaching time does the material require? Is the
material intended for a full course or as a learning object in one class session?
OER Barriers. OER barriers include issues related to the aforementioned digital
divide. OERs are digital resources and require access to a computer, tablet, or smart
device. Most OER libraries are hosted on the internet and require access to reliable, highspeed internet. School districts in resource-poor communities could struggle to provide
students and instructors with the technology and bandwidth needed to host OERs.
Security concerns could prove an additional concern, as materials are accessed and
downloaded through public contributions to open access libraries.
OER design, creation and sustainability requires funding and support from
administrators; OER use relies on a commitment from teachers and students. Teachers
and students, as users, are more likely to use an OER that is customized to their needs
and is easy-to-use. The recommended level of customization—the creation of and or
provision of community-specific content and the evaluation of materials—requires a
significant time investment.
While contributions to OER libraries have predominantly stemmed from
volunteer contributions, contributions from commercial publishers is growing and could
also prove a barrier. The popularity of OERs has led to a decline in the need for physical
materials and some publishers have responded by creating open resources as cheaper
alternatives (Welz, 2017).

Online and In-Person Learning
OER learning opportunities can be presented online, in-person, or as a
combination of both. As a web-based intervention, OERs probably have similar outcomes
as when compared to in-person interventions; or web-based intervention might even
perform better. This holds true, even for complex health-related issues, as described in a
meta-analysis on the effectiveness of web-based and non-web based interventions on
health-related behavioral change outcomes. The study concluded that web-based
interventions produced such outcomes as “increased exercise time, increased knowledge
of nutritional status, increased knowledge of asthma treatment, increased participation in
healthcare, slower health decline, improved body shape perception, and 18-month weight
loss maintenance” (Wantland, Portillo, Holzemer, Slaughter, & McGhee, 2004). Another
study comparing internet and traditional interventions suggested that web-based
interventions are superior to in-person interventions, particularly within rural and lowincome audiences: “clients who have received web-based education are interested in and,
in fact, prefer … education websites as a method of receiving … education. 83% of webbased participants also reported a willingness to use the website again”. The preference
for web-based interventions is influenced by such factors as the convenience of
completing learning modules in a home setting, reduced distraction by being in a
familiar, comfortable environment, the reduced need for travel, and an appreciation of the
breadth of electronically available information (Bensley, Anderson, Brusk, Mercer, &
Rivas, 2011).
Cultivating Communities of Practice
Successful OER learning relies, in part, on successfully cultivating a community
of practice. This pilot project research would rely on a community of librarians to
manage and update OER content. Wenger, McDermott, and Snyder (2002) define a
community of practice as “any community of practice which cannot rely on face-to-face
meeting and interactions as its primary vehicle for connecting members’. Threats to such
a community include distance, size, organizational affiliation, and cultural differences.

These threats can be overcome, and a community cultivated with seven principles
(Wenger et. al, 2002):
1. Design for evolution. The success of new community efforts rely on volunteer
efforts and volunteers may have varying amounts of passion and time to commit to a
project. To encourage accountability, focus on simple structures—provide lists of what
tasks need to be completed and who will complete them and have as little governance as
needed. Anticipate the departure of volunteers and be prepared to redistribute work to
new talent. Throughout the life of the project, work to generate newcomers to balance
off-boarding and so that work is always evenly distributed.
2. Open a dialogue between inside and outside perspectives. Communities consist
of ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’. Insiders are experts in a given issue and serve as the core of
the community. Outsiders have some domain knowledge and the enthusiasm to help.
They offer new energy, novel ideas, and new perspectives. Successful communities use
both insider and outsider contributions.
3. Invite different levels of participation. Communities often need to tackle
difficult tasks that require expert or insider knowledge, but participation from experts can
be difficult to acquire and their time commitment limited. Communities of practice
require a process for creating experts and to allow new community participants to grow
and gain expertise. To train new community members Wenger promotes legitimate
peripheral participation, a type of apprenticeship under which the skill sets of new
practitioners are identified and grown through work with members of the entire
community of practice. Legitimate peripheral participation is particularly important in
volunteer communities because it encourages investment from newcomers by allowing
them to learn and do more, and build on existing skills and interests.
4. Develop both public and private community spaces. Transparency in an
organization does not mean having every conversation in public but is a balance of public
and private conversations. One-on-one, private communication can help build trust in a
way that multiway communication does not, especially amongst new participants. Private
conversations can also inform public conversations with insights from participants that

A Collaborative Approach to Improving Adolescent eHealth Literacy

might not be shared with a broader audience. Private conversations are especially useful
in conflict resolution. Conversations that relate to actions that impact others should be
part of a public forum.
5. Focus on value. Community members should feel that their work is valuable,
and should be provided an outlet—for example, online forums or regularly scheduled
meetings, to express and reflect on the value of their work. Ideas for new contributions,
even experimental ones, should be encouraged.
6. Combine familiarity and excitement. Simple structures and working processes
provide stability in the completion of daily tasks. However, new challenges and
opportunities should be made available to energize established participants and attract
new ones. The excitement stimulated by new opportunities helps keep volunteers
motivated.
7. Create a rhythm for the community. Rhythm is an important consideration in a
community of practice. It is a delicate balance—moving too quickly lead to participants
feeling overwhelmed while moving too slowly could result in participants being bored
and uninterested.

Chapter 2: Designing Digital Learning Tools

The Transtheoretical Model
The proposed OER focuses on eHealth literacy training. Ehealth literacy
interventions should go beyond the simple provision of information and encourage actual
behavior change. Behavior change models include careful consideration of information
content and characteristics--such as the delivery of information, its appearance, message
style, and information architecture (Ritterband, Thorndike, Cox, Kovatchev, & GonderFrederick, 2009). The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) provides a framework for
developing interventions that help modify behavior. TTM has been successfully applied
to the cessation of negative behaviors like smoking and delinquent behavior, and the
acquisition of positive behaviors like safer sex practices and regular exercise. It consists
of four key elements,
1. Stages of Change: an individual’s temporal readiness to modify health behavior
2. Decisional Balance: the perceived importance of the benefits and disadvantages
of change
3. Situational Self-Efficacy: the confidence in self-ability to modify behavior
across social, negative affect, and difficult situations
4. Processes of Change: the experiential and behavioral strategies used by
individuals to progress through stages of change.
The Transtheoretical Model defines stages for a specific process leading to
behavior change. This stage-tailored change approach promotes measurable, sustainable,
and lasting improvements in behavior, decisional balance, and self-efficacy. Participants
are distributed across five stages of change--Precontemplation, Contemplation,
Preparation, Action, and Maintenance. Interventions include a staging measure to classify
users into one of these five stages, then an individual’s classified stage is used to
determines which intervention is appropriate.
Three dimensions help organize the constructs of TTM (Di Noia, Contento, &
Prochaska, 2008):

1. The Temporal Dimension: Stages of Change
2. The Dependent Variable Dimension: Decisional Balance and Situational SelfEfficacy
3. Independent Variable Dimension: Processes of Change

Figure 1. The Transtheoretical Model, 5 Stages of Change

The Precontemplation phase incorporates consciousness-raising interventions and
environmental evaluation processes. An example of a consciousness awareness strategy
is having participants complete an assessment providing feedback about their eating or
exercise habits.
The Contemplation and Preparation phases focus on increasing confidence,
encouraging commitment to act, and developing specific plans to modify behavior.
Participants are exposed to actionable self-evaluation and self-liberation strategies, like
setting a daily goal or developing a weekly plan to achieve a goal.
The Action and Maintenance phases focus on encouraging relationships,
counterconditioning, and stimulus control processes. Particularly effective for adolescents
is involvement in a buddy contact system.
The intervention in the Di Noia et al study provides an example of the TTM in
action. The pilot program begins by providing participants with digital intervention
content and with an introductory session that orients participants to the program and
describes the benefits of eating fruits and vegetables. The orientation session included a
staging measure that classified users into three stages: Precomtemplation,

A Collaborative Approach to Improving Adolescent eHealth Literacy

11

Contemplation/Preparation, or Action/Maintenance. Stage classifications were then used
to determine which additional intervention participants would complete:
“Users in precontemplation completed sessions that incorporated consciousness
raising, dramatic relief, and environmental reevaluation processes for enhancing
awareness of lower-than recommended intakes and promoting acceptance of the need for
dietary change. An example of a consciousness-raising change strategy included in this
group of sessions was to increase users’ awareness of their intake by having them
complete an assessment that provided personalized feedback regarding the number of
daily servings of fruits and vegetables they were in the habit of eating” (Di Noia et. al,
2008, p. 5) .
“Users in contemplation/preparation were exposed to self-reevaluation and selfliberation strategies for increasing confidence in the ability to increase intake, resolve
ambivalence regarding commitment to act, and facilitate the development of specific
plans for modifying dietary behavior. An example of a self-liberation change strategy
included in this group of sessions was to help users take steps toward increasing their
intake by having them set a daily fruit and vegetable goal and develop a 1-week menu
and action plan for reaching the goal” (Di Noia, et. al, 2008, p. 5).
“Reinforcement management, helping relationships, counterconditioning, and
stimulus control processes for helping users sustain recommended intake levels were
delivered in sessions for users in action/maintenance. An example of a helping
relationships change strategy included in this group of sessions was to encourage users to
team up with another person who was also interested in maintaining intake and to
develop a “buddy contract” identifying strategies for giving each other support” (Di Noia
et. al, 2008, p. 5).
Design Considerations
The proposed OER is intended for high school and middle school health teachers
and librarians; teachers are students and librarians are instructors. It represents two
distinct demographic groups--recent graduates/new teachers, age 21-25 and experienced
teachers, aged 26-70. All groups are college educated, experienced computer users, and

12

middle to upper-middle class. Common design suggestions, particularly Nielsen’s Ten
Usability Heuristics (Nielsen, 1995) and Schneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules of Interface
Design (Schneiderman, 1998) are considered in designing for the audience of
experienced teachers. However, it is important to consider how young adults differ in
their preferences for digital interfaces. A 2016 study from the Nielsen Norman Group,
“Young Adults/Millennials as Web Users” (Meyers, 2016), found unique behaviors in
millennials’ use of digital interfaces:
1. Young adults are confident in their ability to navigate digital interfaces
2. Young adults embrace new design patterns, but are error prone--’Click first,
ask questions later’
3. Young adults see usability issues as design flaws and will criticize the
organization, not themselves when things go wrong
4. Young adults will quickly turn to Google as a reference and as an example of a
simple, easy to use interface
5. Young adults have different ideas of visual appeal and interpret flat designs as
more attractive
6. When using social media, young adults prefer interesting, relevant posts that
focus on building relationships over time
7. Multitasking is parallel--done linearly, not simultaneously. Like other users,
young adults are less efficient when context-switching
8. Parallel browsing, or using tabs to support several, unrelated tasks is a popular
habit amongst young adults
9. Page Parking, or using multiple tabs to support a single task, is also a popular
practice amongst young adults
A Summary of Literature Review Findings
Teachers who can teach eHealth literacy in a way that encourages positive health
behavior changes and provides standardized and personalized health information can be
more successful in cultivating adolescents with strong eHealth literacy skills. Librarians
play an important role in creating and designing eHealth literacy learning interventions

for teachers and in OER management and implementation. Such OERs can help alleviate
common issues that librarians experience, particularly difficulty locating appropriate
digital content for classroom use, teacher discomfort using digital content, and unclear
strategies for moving teachers to sustained digital content use in the classroom.
Understanding and adjusting for the limitations of OER interventions in environments
with limited internet and technology access, and providing sustainable, accessible
solutions is a challenge that can be alleviated by providing printable and editable versions
of OER course content.

Chapter 3: Study Methodology

Audience Heuristics
This study investigates and pilots a librarian-led, continuing education Open
Educational Resource (OER) that high school and middle school health teachers can use
to improve their confidence teaching eHealth literacy competencies. The pilot project is
intended for two distinct demographic groups--new teachers and recent graduates, age
21-25 and experienced teachers, aged 26-70. All groups are college educated,
experienced computer users, and middle to upper-middle class. Common design
suggestions, particularly Nielsen’s Ten Usability Heuristics, Schneiderman’s Eight
Golden Rules of Interface Design, and Nielsen Norman Group’s Design Suggestions for
Millennial Users are considered in designing for this audience. See Appendix E for a
detailed review of Schneiderman and Nielsen’s design suggestions.

Observation
To understand the tools, resources, and training currently available to Health
teachers, the author subscribed to notices and monthly emails from the Healthy Teacher
Network. The Healthy Teacher Network assists and empowers teachers to create healthy
school environments by:


creating a network where teachers, service providers, and health experts
share ideas and best practices



providing tools, resources, and training for teachers to implement
activities to promote healthy lifestyles



supporting teachers advocating for policies, curricula, and programs to
create a healthy school environment



sharing research that demonstrates the importance of healthy eating and
physical activity as integral to student academic success

The Network offers workshops and professional development opportunities for
teachers in the greater Chicago area--these opportunities are highly-rated by participants,
with a 4.6 of 5 rating. Workshops cover a range of topics and teaching components
include interactive presentations, guest speaker lectures, and resource fairs that encourage
networking with organizations, programs, services. Workshop attendees earn professional
development credit, meet and connect with service providers that offer free or low-cost
programs to schools, and become leaders in school health and wellness promotion. To

date, these highly-rated learning opportunities have only been offered in-person, but
similar online experiences could be equally beneficial.
Assessment
A needs assessment survey was conducted to understand the confidence level of
health teachers when teaching health literacy, technology literacy, and behavior change
competencies and to understand how teachers prefer to receive continuing education.
Assessment competencies were based on those from the eHEALS eHealth Literacy Scale,
an accepted measure for assessing consumers’ perceived skills at using information
technology for health and aiding in determining the fit between eHealth programs and
consumers. An email invite on a jobs listserve for health teachers was used to recruit
middle and high school health teachers to complete the needs assessment. The email
included a link to the online survey. Qualtrics survey software was used to create the
survey and manage responses. 17 teachers completed and submitted the survey. Results
of the assessment were used to create a framework for instruction units that can be taught
either online or in-person.
Methodology
The Needs Assessment consisted of three parts:
1. Confidence Ranking
2. Learning Preferences
3. Open-Ended Comments.
Three formats were used for questions—a matrix format, a question where users
chose from a list, and a paragraph description. The survey was online—participants were
provided with a link to a Qualtrics survey. Users were recruited through a jobs mailing
list for new and experienced health and physical education teachers. The survey required
participants to declare themselves as high school or middle school health teachers before
participating. No incentives were provided to participants. 17 teachers completed and
returned the assessment. Survey takers were told that information was being collected to
understand high school and middle school health teacher confidence teaching health and
technology literacy competencies and to understand learning preferences.

In Part 1 of the Needs Assessment, the Confidence Ranking, participants
selected either Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Somewhat Disagree, Neither Agree nor
Disagree, Somewhat Agree, Agree, or Strongly Agree for 9 queries. See Appendix A for
a full list of questions and responses.
The second part of the Need Assessment asked participants to select how
they most preferred to learn, given a choice of four options. Multiple selections were
allowed.
The third, and final, part of the Needs Assessment was an open-ended
question: Additional comments or suggestions?
Results
Results from the needs assessment show that participants are already confident in
eHealth literacy competencies related to using the internet to find health information
resources, but slightly less confident in competencies related to evaluating health
resources. Findings suggest that teachers are interested in interventions that improve their
confidence in teaching students to use the internet to answer questions about their health
and evaluate the health resources they find on the internet. Full survey results are in
Appendix B.
1. Over 88% of participants agreed that the internet was useful in helping them
teach students to make decisions about their health; 12 participants strongly agreed, 1
participant agreed, and 2 participants somewhat agreed.
2. Over 94% of participants thought it was important for their students to be able
to access health resources on the internet, with 13 participants strongly agreeing and 3
participants agreeing.
3. Over 88% of participants were confident in their ability to teach students to
where to find helpful health resources on the internet, with 7 participants strongly
agreeing, 5 participants agreeing, and 3 participants somewhat agreeing.
4. Over 88% of participants were confident in their ability to teach students how
to find helpful resources on the internet, with 8 participants strongly agreeing, 4
participants agreeing, and 3 participants somewhat agreeing.

5. Over 88% of participants were confident in their ability to teach students how
to use the internet to answer questions about their health, with 6 participants strongly
agreeing, 5 participants agreeing, and 4 participants somewhat agreeing.
6. Over 76% of participants were confident in their ability to teach students how
to use the health information they found on the internet to help them make decisions, with
6 strongly agreeing, 5 agreeing, and 2 somewhat agreeing.
7. Over 76% of participants were confident in their ability to teach students to
evaluate the health resources they find on the internet, with 4 participants strongly
agreeing, 8 participants agreeing, and 2 participants somewhat agreeing.
8. Over 76% of participants were confident in their ability to teach students how
to tell high-quality health resources from low-quality health resources on the internet,
with 6 participants strongly agreeing, 5 agreeing, and 2 somewhat agreeing.
9. Over 82% of participants were confident in their ability to teach students to feel
confident in using information from the internet to make health decisions, with 8 strongly
agreeing, 3 agreeing, and 3 somewhat agreeing.
The second part of the needs assessment asked participants to indicate how they
would most prefer to learn about teaching and eHealth literacy, technology literacy, and
behavior change communication. The most popular preferences were for live workshop
series and self-paced modules, which received 11 votes each. Reading assigned academic
articles received 6 votes and completing a series of hour-long videos received 2 votes.
Full survey results are in Appendix B.
Three respondents left comments in Part 3 of the Needs Assessment. Those
responses suggested that participants felt eHealth literacy skills were valuable and would
prefer an online class or online training as a continuing education opportunity:
1.

“These are important skills.”

2.

“I would prefer this as an online training opportunity. Evaluating

information sources on the internet is timely.”
3.

“A Coursera class or something similar would be great!”

Sketches
The creation of this course prototype followed Lepore’s sketch to design
continuum (Lepore, 2010), which illustrates the relationship between design
communication, level of fidelity, and iteration between phases. Following that model, the
project design began with freehand sketches--ideas that served as the foundation for the
wireframe and design work. Sketches help generate ideas and possibilities; they are lowstake, low-investment, quick, disposable, and minimally detailed. Figures 5 and 6 are
examples of sketches. Figure 6 depicts a sample functional flow, a rough approximation
of how a user would navigate through the course, while Figure 5 is an initial

Personas
Personas are representations of key target audiences, based on qualitative and
quantitative user research. Personas help define the purpose and vision for a resource,
describe the user, and describe the user’s motivation. Personas generally include:
•

a fictional name

•

job title

•

responsibilities

•

demographics such as age, education, and ethnicity

•

goals and tasks when using the resource

•

physical, social, and technological environment

•

a quote that summarizes the user’s goals for the resource

Three personas were designed for this project; one representing a new, inexperienced
teacher—Felicity Mills, one representing an experienced teacher—Jamie Woodard, and
one representing a school librarian—Sarah Slater. These personas can be found in
Appendix F.

Workflow Sketches
Testing workflow usability is important because it helps to ensure a workflow process
runs smoothly and that users feel in control throughout their use of an application.
Testing a project’s workflow early in its design can reveal undiscovered errors in
relatedness, can users connect screen A with screen B? It can also reveal issues
surrounding abandonment, are users giving up because they don’t know what to do? And
it can reveal areas of potential frustration, is the workflow time and task efficient
(Nielsen, 2011).
This project tested three workflows:
1. The sample workflow for Felicity depicts how a user would navigate when
starting at the home page, as a new or returning user.
2. The sample workflow for Jamie depicts how a user would navigate after logging
in or creating an account.
3. The sample workflow for Sarah depicts how a user would navigate at the start of
the first lesson.

Wireframes
Wireframes serve as visual guides for a website’s structure and the relationship
between pages. They outline a site’s structure and flow. Wireframes are a response to the
best ideas generated during the sketching phase; they are slightly refined sketches that
should be quick and inexpensive to generate and minimally detailed (Lepore, 2010).
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes for this project, then prototypes were
generated from the results.
Balsamiq is a rapid prototyping tool that allows for the quick creation and editing
of mockups. In this preliminary approach, the designer drafted several prototypes for a
© 2017 McGowan, Bethany

A Collaborative Approach to Improving Adolescent eHealth Literacy

25

course home page and a course content page. Then, one school librarian and one health
teacher tested the prototypes and gave feedback. Participants were recruited from a local
high school and were not compensated. Each prototype test was moderated by an
experienced designer, was live and in-person, and the user’s navigation was recorded.
These records, with user feedback, were used to select the most usable designs for
prototyping testing in Axure.
Prototypes
The most usable Balsamiq prototypes, one for the home screen and one sample
content page, served as the basis for Axure prototype designs. Axure is a wireframing and
tool that creates highly functional, prototypes. Figure 10 illustrates an Axure prototype
design for the initial enrollment page--the launch screen for the course. It is a refinement
of the earlier Sample Idea Sketch, Figure 5, which was slightly edited in its Balsamiq
wireframe.

Figure 10. Home Page Prototype (Axure)

After the Axure prototypes were created, they were user tested. 9 participants
were tested over a two-day time period using a Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA) technique
that encouraged participants to think aloud while completing assigned tasks. The tests

A Collaborative Approach to Improving Adolescent eHealth Literacy

26

were moderated by an experienced facilitator who welcomed each participant, explained
the user testing process, proved a written and verbal assignment of tasks, and took notes
on participant behavior and success/failure of each task. The tests were conducted using a
User Testing Tasks Script. See Appendix D for the full document. Data collected
included task completion rates.
Final Design
The Axure prototypes and the results of the user tests, provided the structure,
flow, and details needed for the final design. Marvel App was used to add elements of
visual design, branding, and to more fully develop the course.
Figure 11 illustrates the final design for the course’s Main Menu. After users have
logged in, the appropriate week is highlighted, so they can easily pick up where they left
off. This page was created in response to the results of the user testing, where participants
expressed a need for a page between the homepage and the beginning of the first lesson
and they needed a means to more easily navigate between lessons. Finally, users desired a
means to more easily distinguish between lessons, so leach lesson was given an icon and
unique color scheme.

Figure 11. Final Marvel Prototype, Main Menu

Figure 12 illustrates what users see when they select Week 1 from Main Menu--a
summary of the week’s required readings, assessments, assignments, and learning
activities. From this point, users can return to the main menu, view their account, or start
the lesson. Week 1 content includes behavior change strategies identified in the literature
review; it includes a section that reviews course goals, objectives and expectations and
includes an entry behavior assessment to help participants and instructors measure
specific student needs. It also uses a course forum and social media, Pinterest, to engage
participants and create a sense of community.

Figure 12. Final Marvel Prototype, Week 1

Figure 13 represents a content page of required coursework for Week 1. Content
slides include information that introduces students to the course--for example, grading
schemes, a code of conduct, and activities. They follow a consistent design and color
scheme so users have a predictable experience while completing the unit. A Progress Bar
is included in the upper right corner to help users track where they are in the process and
keep them motivated by highlighting progress once they’ve completed a task; at the
bottom of each page is a Back button so users can easily re-visit content on previous
pages; a Main Menu button returns users to the course’s Main Menu, and a Next button

allows users to proceed through the unit. In the final page of the unit, a ‘Complete’ button
replaces the ‘Next’ button and users receive a check mark to indicate they have
completed the unit. See Appendix C for a full synopsis of Week 1 content.

Chapter 4: Discussion and Conclusion

Discussion
A review of the literature reveals evidence of a digital divide and disparities in
eHealth literacy competencies amongst adolescents. As information shifts to become
mostly electronically available, literacy education is struggling to keep up. Librarians in
K-12 education, responsible for teaching information literacy competencies, struggle with
issues that include difficulty locating appropriate digital content for classroom use,
teacher discomfort using digital content, and unclear strategies for moving teachers to
sustained digital content use in the classroom. Findings from research in behavior change
communication suggest that the digital divide and eHealth literacy disparities can be
alleviated with customizable, systemic interventions. The Transtheoretical Model
provides an example of how such interventions can be designed. This research project
focuses the development of an Open Educational Resource (OER) that educators,
particularly librarians and high school & middle school health teachers, can use to design
lesson plans that combat the digital divide, teach eHealth literacy competencies, and
encourage behavior change.
This project included the execution of a needs assessment to determine teacher
confidence in teaching health literacy competencies and to determine learning
preferences. 17 surveys were completed and returned, and the results revealed that
teachers are mostly confident in their ability to teach eHealth literacy competencies, but
are interested in learning to improve their confidence in teaching students to use the
internet to answer health-related questions and in evaluating health information. When
asked how they would prefer to learn, nearly 65% of responses reported a preference for
learning through self-paced modules, and over 35% responded with a preference to learn
through reading assigned academic articles. The OER prototype design for this project
utilized both self-paced modules and assigned readings of academic articles.

Balsamiq Wireframe User Testing Analysis
The findings from the initial user tests, the wireframe testing, revealed user
confusion when navigating between lessons and when attempting to return to the home
page once a lesson was started. These findings resulted in the creation of a Main Menu, a
page that allowed users to more easily navigate between lessons and to return to the
course home page; and also to the creation of a "Home" icon on each lesson page that
navigated users back to the Home Page. After testing was completed, users were asked
what might encourage them to register for the course; these verbal responses revealed a
desire to see a rating system and results from colleagues who had previously completed
the course. This led to the creation of a "Student Reviews" component, which allowed
prospective students to see comments and ratings from users who completed the course.
Finally, during the wireframe testing users expressed the need for one central place to
find detailed information about the course. This led to the creation of a syllabus that users
were able to access from the enrollment page prior to registering for the course, and from
the Home page after they were enrolled in the course.
Axure Prototype User Testing Analysis
The results of the wireframe testing informed the design of an Axure prototype of the
course, which was tested on 9 participants. Starting at the course Home Page, participants
were asked to complete a series of tasks. Users were encouraged to verbalize questions or
concerns as they encountered them in their completion of the assigned tasks.
1. Task 1: How much of a time commitment will the course require?
With a completion rate of 100%, participants were successful in completing a task
that required them to find general information, such as time commitment, about
the course. The most direct method for finding the requested information was by
reading the text on the home page, and 7 of the 9 participants used that approach.
1 participant used the Q&A button and 1 used the Syllabus button to retrieve the
requested information. These results suggest that general information, such as
time commitment, should be repeated throughout the site. 1 participant had

© 2017 McGowan, Bethany

A Collaborative Approach to Improving Adolescent eHealth Literacy

34

difficulty completing the task, overlooking the requested information on both the
home page and on the course syllabus, but ultimately finding it on the Q&A page.
2. Task 2: Where would you go to find more specific information about coursework
and assignments?
With a completion rate of 100%, participants were successful in completing a task
that required them to find detailed course information. All 9 participants used the
Syllabus button to find the requested information, without none having difficulty
completing the task. The suggestion to include a course syllabus for potential
students emerged during the paper prototype testing and the results of the Axure
prototype tests suggest that students, particularly teachers, will navigate to a
syllabus or similar resource for detailed course information.
3. Task 3: Where would you go to find general information about the course?
This task, similar to Task 1, asked participants to find general course information.
The findings from the results of Task 1—that general information should be
repeated throughout the site, were confirmed as participants used a range of
resources to find the information. 5 participants read the information on the home
page, 3 participants used the About the Course button, and 1 participant used the
Q&A button. All participants were able to complete the task without difficulty,
for a completion rate of 100%
4. Task 4: You are a new user. How would you register for the course?
Whereas previous tasks asked users to locate information that could be found in
multiple places, Task 4 required users to find information only available on the
Home Page. All 9 participants completed the task with ease by selecting one of
the “Enroll Now” buttons on the Home Page. During Task 1, one participant
overlooked the requested information on the Home Page, ultimately finding the
information elsewhere, but that participant was able to complete Task 4 with ease.
These findings suggested that some information on the Home Page needed to be
more distinguished, and led to a change in the Home Page layout, where some

© 2017 McGowan, Bethany

A Collaborative Approach to Improving Adolescent eHealth Literacy

35

general information such as course instructor, course timeline, and course time
commitment was more clearly labeled and placed into a separate column.
5. Task 5: You are a returning user. How would you pick up where you last left off?
Task 5 required participants to make an intuitive assumption that they would need
to login to pick up where they last left off. 7 of the 9 participants completed the
task, but 6 of those 7 needed prompting before being able to complete the task and
2 participants were not able to complete the task. The 7 participants who
completed the task all used the Login button. To alleviate this issue buttons were
relabeled; a New User button allowed participants to create an account, while a
Returning User button allowed participants to log-in and pick up where they left
off in a lesson.
6. Task 6: Where would you find information about what previous course attendees
have to say about the course?
Task 6 served as a test of the site’s architecture in testing user’s ability to interpret
labels. In this task users were asked to find what previous course attendees said
about the course, information that was located under a button labeled ‘Reviews’.
This button could only be accessed from the course Home Page. 6 of the 9
participants completed the task with ease, but 3 participants could not find the
requested information and failed to complete the task. To alleviate this issue, the
access to course reviews were placed on other pages as informed by where
participants looked for information in their completion of other tasks, including
the Q&A page and the About the Course page.
7. Task 7: Navigate through Lesson 1.
In this final task, users began at the start of Lesson 1 and were asked to navigate
through the entire lesson, to the end. They were asked to verbalize each new
action taken as they continued through the lesson and those verbal responses
informed design changes. This feedback focused on implementing changes that
helped users more easily track their progress through the lesson and resulted in
the inclusion of a progress bar throughout each lesson page to allow participants
© 2017 McGowan, Bethany

A Collaborative Approach to Improving Adolescent eHealth Literacy

36

to see how much of a lesson was completed and roughly how much was left.
Feedback also led to the inclusion of a check mark and a ‘Complete’ status to
indicate a lesson’s completion. Other feedback surrounded the ease in
distinguishing lessons from one another and ultimately led to each lesson being
color-coded, to allow users to more quickly and easily distinguish between
lessons.
The results and modifications from the wireframe testing and the Axure prototype
testing informed the design of an interactive Marvel Prototype. These Marvel prototypes
are illustrated in Appendix C.
Content Analysis
Course content, activities, and flow utilize an active learning approach based on
Jerome Bruner’s Constructivist Theory which suggests learning is “an active process in
which learners construct new ideas or concepts based upon their current/past knowledge”
(Bruner, 1966). The proposed activities work to engage learners in reflection activities
that build on existing knowledge and help progress learners toward a greater
understanding of new knowledge. This approach was particularly relevant as the needs
assessment revealed that participants self-identified as feeling mostly confident in their
ability to teach health literacy, technology literacy, and behavior change competencies
but hoped to develop a greater expertise. Activities were designed to allow participants to
interpret information, reflect, and build on their existing knowledge. One activity, the
redesign of an existing lesson plan, threaded throughout the entire course and served to
tie each of the four units together.
An entry behavior assessment in Week 1 provides the instructor a basis for
measuring student need, and when paired with the exit assessment in Week 4, serves as a
quantitative and qualitative means to measure student learning. Weeks 2 and 3 include
quiz assessments to incrementally test student knowledge and measure learning
throughout the course. Further qualitative assessments are provided through student use
of the course forums.

A Collaborative Approach to Improving Adolescent eHealth Literacy

37

Students are encouraged to participate in the creation of course content with a
requirement to create a Pinterest account and, each week, contribute related content to a
shared course Pinterest board. They are also required to leave a comment on at least two
other pins. This approach utilizes social media to allow students to gather related course
content on a platform that remains accessible after the course’s completion.
Several measures were implemented to cultivate a community of practice. The
course structure is simple, with each week following a predictable layout that includes
required readings, an assessment, two learning activities, and one assignment.
Expectations are clearly established in Week 1. Students e-introduce themselves at the
beginning of the course and are organized into groups. Each week, a group leads the class
in a review of the assigned weekly readings. Throughout the week students are
encouraged to use the course forum—a private forum and the course Pinterest board—a
public forum, to ask questions and stimulate conversation. At the end of the course,
alumni are added to a LinkedIn group, if desired, allowing them to remain connected.
Conclusion
The creation and testing of this open educational resource prototype focus on
training high school and middle school health teachers to integrate eHealth literacy
competencies into their curriculums using innovative multimedia technology. This focus
on eHealth literacy aims to minimize the digital divide and to minimize eHealth literacy
disparities by improving teacher confidence. It highlights the importance of collaboration
between teachers, designers, and librarians in the creation of digital health interventions.
User feedback for the need of such a resource was positive--both in the results of the
literature review and in the user testing process. Potential next steps include collaborating
with an instructional designer to design the curriculum for the course then finding a home
for the course, on a home-grown platform or an existing one--such as OER Commons.
Other steps might include the development of eHealth literacy training materials for
adolescent use.

Appendix D: User Testing Tasks Script
Welcome and Purpose
Thank you so much for coming in today. I want to give you a little information about
what you will be looking at and give you time to ask any questions you might have
before we get started. Today we are asking you to serve as an evaluator of a course
website and to complete a set of tasks. Our goal is to see how easy or difficult you find
the site to use.
Test Facilitator’s Role
I am here to record your reactions and your successes and/or failures in completing tasks
related to the website you will view. During this session, I would like you to think aloud
as you work to complete the tasks. I will be able to offer suggestions or hints if needed. I
may also ask you to clarify what you have said or ask you for information on what you
were looking for or what you expect to have happened.
Test Participant’s Role
Today I am going to be asking you to look for some information on the site and tell me
how easy or difficult it was to find the information. These activities are all about how
easy we have made it for people to use the site. There is no right or wrong answer. If you
have any questions, comments or areas of confusion while you are working, please let me
know. If you ever feel that you are lost or cannot complete a task with the information
that you have been given, please let me know. I will ask you what you might do in a realworld setting and then either put you on the right track or move you on to the next
scenario. As you use the site, please do so as you would at home or your office. I would
ask that you to try work through the tasks based on what you see on screen, but if you
reach a point where you are not sure where or how to find something, please feel free to
use ‘Search’.
I may ask you other questions as we go and we will have wrap-up questions at the end.
Do you have any questions before we begin?
Tasks
1.
Before you enroll in the course you want to learn more about it.
a) How much of a time commitment will the course require?
b) Where would you go to find more specific information about coursework and
assignments?
c) Where would you go to find general information about the course?
d) You are a new user. How would you register for the course?
e) You are a returning user. How would you pick up where you last left off?
f) Where would you find information about what previous course attendees have to
say about the course?
2.

Appendix E: Common Design Suggestions
Nielsen’s Ten Usability Heuristics (Nielsen, 1990)
1.
Visibility of system status. Keep users informed of what’s happening by
providing actionable and timely feedback.
2.
Match between the system and the real world. Speak the user’s language by
using familiar words, phrases, and concepts. Avoid system-oriented terms.
Information should be natural and logically organized.
3.
User control and freedom. Users will inevitably choose a function by mistake.
Provide an out that will allow users to avoid too much hassle. Undo and redo
options work well.
4.
Consistency and standards. Follow conventions so users don’t question if
different words or actions mean the same thing.
5.
Error prevention. Good design prevents problems from occurring. Get rid of
situations that easily generate errors and allow users to confirm actions before
they commit to them.
6.
Recognition rather than recall. People generally have trouble remembering
things—make things easier by making actions and options clearly visible.
Don’t force users to remember information across dialogs. Provide visible,
easily retrievable instructions
7.
Flexibility and efficiency of use. Allow shortcuts, or accelerators, for expert
users. Allow users to customize actions.
8.
Aesthetic and minimalist design. Get rid of any irrelevant or rarely used
information.
9.
Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. Use plain language
to express error messages. Tell the problem, directly, and provide a solution.
10.
Help and documentation. Design like you won’t need help documentation, but
provide it anyway. Help guides should be searchable, task-oriented, and list
concrete steps.
Schneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design (Schneiderman, 1998)
1.
Strive for consistency.
2.
Allow frequent users the option to use shortcuts.
3.
Offer informative feedback.
4.
Design dialog to yield closure.
5.
Offer simple error handling.
6.
Permit easy reversal of actions.
7.
Support internal locus of control.
8.
Reduce short-term memory load.
