ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Literally hundreds of colleagues, friends, and scholars helped me during my doctoral
journey. First, I was fortunate enough to have a committee who was open to my topic and
goals. Kerri Kearney was the best advisor I could ask for, providing both insightful
critiques and moral support. Tami Moore, Lu Bailey, and Tanya Finchum served
diligently on my committee, providing theoretical, methodological, and subject matter
expertise that helped me take this work to a higher level than I would have achieved
alone. Other professors, such as Stephen Wanger and Denni Blum, shaped my
understanding of educational theory and qualitative research design. My colleagues in the
academic library community also contributed to this work by replying to my tweets,
listening to my presentations on my preliminary findings, or providing critiques on
publications related to my research. My participants also shared their time during a busy
time of the semester, and I am very grateful for their generosity.
I couldn't have had better or more supportive workplace than the Rogers State University
Libraries. In the spring of 2010, my director Alan Lawless forwarded me an email
announcing a recruitment meeting for the doctoral program (presented by future
committee member Tami Moore), and strongly encouraged me to apply. My colleagues
have also provided practical and moral support during this journey. Without Laura
Bottoms, Jan Ferris, Carolyn Gutierrez, George Gottschalk, Allison Embry, Kelly Ewing,
Charles Chessher, Stephanie Ingold, Susan Cleveland, Ryan Dyer, Shirley Windle, Keith
Orr, Audrey Baker, and Karin Webster, as well as dozens of student workers, I would not
have been able to juggle the dual roles of doctoral student and Associate Library
Director. My first research partner, Dr. Susan Chinburg, inspired me to consider pursuing
a PhD, and provided invaluable guidance during this journey.
My parents, Wally and Connie Walker, my brother, Daniel Walker, and my mother-inlaw, JoAnn Clark, have been enthusiastic cheerleaders throughout this scholarly journey.
My cohort-mates Jennifer Campbell, Carolyn Cox, Molly Farley, Mel France, Toni Hail,
Katie Majestic, Pam Pittman, and Jerrett Phillips became more than classmates and
colleagues, they became lifelong friends. “Surf's up!” Other special friends provided
support and reminded me to laugh on occasion. Special thanks and love go to Cindy
Large, Lauren Balk, Melanie Mitchell, Amy Gravino, Jaime Hitchcock, Ken Mills, Iain
Lee, Dr. Carol Mortensen, Cindy McKinney and Stuart Watson.
Last but not least, this adventure would simply have been impossible without the support
of my husband, Kevin Clark. Kevin, as I've said too many times to count, this degree
would be meaningless without you. I love you more than words can say, and I can't wait
to find out where our life takes us next. The next 100 loads of laundry are on me.

Title of Study: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE REFERENCE DESK: EXPLORING
UNDERGRADUATES’INFORMATION SEARCH MEDIATION
EXPERIENCES THROUGH THE ACRL FRAMEWORK
Major Field: EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP & POLICY STUDIES
Abstract: Information seeking, a key aspect of information literacy, is relevant to student
academic success as well as to leadership, organizational and public policy issues within
higher education. Although librarians contend that students should consult formal
mediators for help during an information search, students are much more likely to prefer
consulting what are defined in the literature as informal mediators. This contradiction
suggests the current literature of information seeking may not fully depict the aspects of
search mediation that are actually the most important to student information seekers.
Purpose and Questions: The purpose of my study was to explore lower-division
undergraduates’ thoughts, feelings, and actions as they engage in and reflect on their
information search mediation encounters over the course of an information search
process. My study was guided by two central questions:
1. What are the characteristics of information search mediation encounters as experienced
by lower-division undergraduate students?
2. How do students use search mediation encounters to navigate the information search
process?
Methods and Theory: To explore these questions, I employed Stake's (2006) multiple
case study methodology. Each student's assignment-related experiences of information
search mediation and information seeking were considered a case for the purposes of this
study. After analyzing individual cases in isolation for key findings, I considered them as
a set to identify cross-case assertions that describe the essence of the topic under
investigation. I then examined and discussed the cross-case through the lens of the
Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education, the primary theoretical framework for the study.
Findings: Six cross-case findings emerged from the data. These findings describe aspects
of mediator selection, the mediation encounter, the role of information search mediation
in the information search process, the influence of lessons learned via mediation on the
final research assignment, and the ways that mediation encounters influenced later
information searches, as well as search mediation as a whole. These provocative findings
both support and problematize the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy, and have
important implications for information literacy theory, research, and practice.

CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION
Over the course of the semester-long narrative inquiry (S. Clark, 2014) that
inspired this study, “Ashley” shared a great deal with me about her experiences seeking
information for course-related research papers. Multiple personal crises and a lack of
preparedness left her overwhelmed and “blocked” when it came time to seek information
for class assignments. In our first meeting, Ashley and I talked at length about the anxiety
that seemed to render her unable to ask formal mediators (Kuhlthau, 2004) such as
librarians for information search help. Ashley looked down at the battered table in the
coffee bar where we sat, sighed, and said, “I’m just chicken” (S. Clark, 2014, p. 68).
However, when we met for our final conversation at the end of the semester,
Ashley seemed transformed. Ashley and her daughters had moved in with her new
boyfriend. She stated he was the first and only person who was helpful with her school
work, and supportive of her goals. Ashley seemed filled with optimism, and she stated it
was because of her new relationship. She described her new partner, who Kuhlthau
(2004) would call an informal mediator, as smart, supportive and ready to help her learn
tasks vital to writing a college research paper. That said, Ashley stated she hadn’t learned
much about information seeking during the semester because she was still scared to ask

1

for help from professionals who she knew could help her learn the skills at which she and
her partner were “no good” (S. Clark, 2014, p. 70).
Unfortunately, Ashley’s choices and anxieties are all too familiar to instruction
and reference librarians who struggle to make the information search process less
intimidating and more productive for students. Academic librarians, while vocal and
passionate supporters of the role of formal information-seeking mediation in the
development of information literacy skills, are less likely to perceive informal search
mediation encounters from the same vantage point as students. Instruction librarians have
valid reasons to believe in the value of their assistance to students. However, students
may have equally logical reasons for preferring to consult a friend or family member in
times of search uncertainty. By transcending the binary formal/informal model of search
mediation and exploring all experiences of search mediation as perceived and constructed
by information seekers themselves, this qualitative study attempted to provide new
insights into information seeking as experienced on the other side of the reference desk.
Students’ skills in information seeking are a key part of the information literacy
abilities that students should acquire in order to succeed both during and after college.
These skills are typically learned and refined in part through search mediation
encounters. According to the American Library Association (ALA), information literacy
is a set of skills that enables people to "recognize when information is needed and have
the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information" (1989). In
2000, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of ALA,
produced a set of six standards for information literacy programs in academic libraries.
According to the standards, all information literate students should be able to define their

2

information needs, successfully locate information, evaluate sources, apply them toward
a larger purpose and use information in a legally and ethically appropriate manner
(Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000).
Given vast changes in pedagogical theory and practice in the last 15 years, the
ACRL commissioned a task force to revise the 2000 standards into a Framework that
would be relevant to current needs of information seekers and instruction librarians
(Association of College and Research Libraries, 2014a, 2014b, 2014c, 2015). The
Framework as completed in 2015 and fully adopted by the ACRL in 2016 consists of six
threshold concepts that are integral to becoming an information literate learner. (Meyer &
Land, 2003). According to Meyer and Land, "a threshold concept can be considered as
akin to a portal, opening up a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking about
something. It represents a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing
something without which the learner cannot progress" (2003, p. 1) The Framework for
Information Literacy (ACRL, 2015) contends that these concepts, once understood by an
information seeker, will transform the ways in which he or she looks for, engage with,
and synthesize information. These concepts are further discussed and critiqued in chapter
2 and form the theoretical framework for this study’s data analysis.
This dissertation study explored information search mediation experiences similar
to those Ashley described. Such a study may help researchers and practitioners to better
understand what happens in a search mediation encounter from the perspective of an
undergraduate student, and how these experiences ripple through the information search
process as a whole. This chapter will open with a description of the scholarly and
professional background for the study, focusing particularly on the role of information

3

literacy in academic achievement and higher education administration. After introducing
the research problem and its significance, the chapter will include a brief summary of the
methodology, definitions of key terms, and the boundaries of the study.
Background of the Study
Although college administrators have long valued the resources and services of a
strong academic library (Grimes, 1993; Lynch et al., 2007), many are unclear about the
library’s role in a changing information environment. Oakleaf (2010) argued that
librarians must identify and promote the value that libraries provide to universities today,
and search for ways to become even more valuable in the future (p. 140). According to
Oakleaf, information literacy instruction is a particularly relevant library service for a
21st century information environment, and both library and institutional leaders should
evaluate its effectiveness accordingly.
Information Literacy and Academic Achievement in the Context of Higher
Education Administration
Instruments such as the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) include
questions designed to assess information literacy skills as a key part of overall student
learning (National Survey of Student Engagement, 2009; Mark & Boruff-Jones, 2003). In
addition to its inclusion in institutional assessment instruments such as NSSE,
administrators and accreditors alike consider information literacy to be a vital aspect of
academic integration and achievement. Both education scholars (Chen, Hirumi, & Zhang,
2007; Ross & Hurlbert, 2004; Williamson & Gregory, 2010) and academic librarians (S.
Clark & Chinburg, 2010; Dykeman & King, 1983; Getty, Burd, Burns, & Piele, 2000;
Hurst & Leonard, 2007; York & Vance, 2009) examine the ways that information literacy

4

enhances academic achievement for college students in a wide variety of disciplines and
course delivery formats. However, an institution of higher education must consider other
critical issues beyond fostering student academic achievement and success. Although
information literacy instruction most directly affects the university’s academic goals, the
library in general and information literacy specifically, influences institutional leadership
and responses to public policy demands, as well as organizational culture within higher
education.
Institutional Leadership. In his seminal text on leadership, Burns (1978) argued
that leaders in politics, business, and education have a duty to transform their followers
by empowering and uplifting them as individuals. Specifically, Burns asserted that the
purpose of leadership is to “engage followers…and in the process to make better citizens
of both leaders and followers” (p. 461). The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) stated
that institutions of higher education must seek to transform both students and the broader
community by emphasizing student learning, institutional improvement, and research and
economic development efforts that benefit the wider community (Higher Learning
Commission, 2013b).
As learning organizations (Senge, 1990) that support the research activities of
students, faculty, and the broader community, academic libraries assist institutions in
their mission of transformational leadership. More specifically, students with strong
information literacy skills are better equipped to gather and critically evaluate the
information they will encounter in their daily lives (Kuhlthau, 2004). If, as Burns (1978)
asserted, leaders have an obligation to transform followers into capable leaders in their

5

own rights, then information literacy instruction should be seen as a key aspect of any
university’s instruction practices.
Public Policy. For better and worse, both the United States Department of
Education and state governments continue to explore ways to hold colleges and
universities accountable for the academic success of their students. In an era in which
higher education is commonly defined as a private asset rather than a public good
(Newfield, 2008), the general public no longer assumes automatically that universities are
as worthy of public support as they were in earlier eras (Geiger, 2005). Scholarpractitioners of higher education leadership such as Kallison and Cohen (2010) argue that
universities must bow to these policy pressures by accepting reform and accountability in
exchange for continued governmental funding and overall intellectual and administrative
autonomy.
Whether or not one agrees with these trends in higher education practice and
public policy, both public and private institutions must maintain accreditation in order to
accept student financial aid and other state and federal funds. Like most accrediting
agencies, the HLC’s criteria for accreditation include standards for the quality and
continuous improvement of teaching and learning (Higher Learning Commission, 2013a).
Specifically, institutions are required to educate students “in the effective use of research
and information resources” (2013a, Criterion 3.d.5).
The Organizational Environment. University administrators and faculty have
long considered the library to be a central component of university organization and
culture. Tierney (2008) noted that the institutional culture and values of organizations in
general, and universities specifically, influence the ways that individuals conceive of and
6

construct knowledge (p. 62). If Grimes (1993) and Lynch, et al. (2007) were correct that
administrators continue to recognize the central role of the academic library (and by
extension information literacy), then scholars of organizational theory such as Tierney
(2008) would likely contend that librarians will continue to shape student learning
activities as they have for the past two centuries. However, the status of the academic
library within the institution may not be as secure as it seems at first glance.
Although Lynch, et al. (2007) reported that presidents and provosts continue to
regard the library as the intellectual heart of the institution, the administrators who
participated in the study also acknowledged that continuing changes in information
access and use could diminish the role of the library in the future. Administrators expect
library leaders to proactively add and improve resources and services that address student
needs while working within budget constraints. The authors asserted that academic
librarianship’s continuing relevance would depend on the field’s ability to adapt to
evolving institutional needs, as well as the needs of the communities universities serve.
Academic Librarianship Responds to a Changing Higher Education Landscape
In the wake of these paradigm shifts, higher education administrators expect
library leaders to proactively address organizational needs, as well as the needs of the
communities that universities serve (Oakleaf, 2010). O’Connor (2006; 2009a; 2009b;
2009c) noted that library leaders increasingly turned to information literacy instruction as
justification for the academic library’s central role in strengthening student learning and
success. However, she asserted that the positivist theoretical foundations of information
literacy result in a transactional model of information “deposits” (Freire, 1970) that “is
neither personally empowering nor conducive to the aims of democracy” (O’Connor,

7

2006, p. 196). For that reason, according to O’Connor, information literacy has yet to
develop the “fully-formed theoretical foundation” (2006, p. 2) necessary for practitioners
to provide their organizations with relevant education in the context of an evolving
organizational and educational culture. Although scholars such as Kuhlthau (1991; 1993;
2004) and Elmborg (2006; 2010; 2012) have incorporated ideas from constructivism and
critical pedagogy into the discourse of information literacy, the theoretical and
pedagogical transformation of information literacy remains a work in progress.
On a more routine level, academic librarians also serve as formal mediators to
students and other information seekers in the course of their information searches.
Whether working with a roomful of students during an information literacy instruction
session, or one-on-one at the reference desk with a student who has experienced obstacles
in the search process, a librarian’s job is to guide students to the information they are
seeking. Ideally, the mediation process will not merely provide the student with the
information being sought after, but also provide counseling and education in the skills a
student needs to become a more effective searcher in his or her own right (Kuhlthau,
2004, p. 115-16). Following in Kuhlthau’s footsteps, authors such as Limberg and Sundin
(2006), McKenna (2009), Shah and Kitzie (2012) and Fourie (2013) have explored
particular models and strategies for improving both the process and the promotion of
formal search mediation services.
However, Kuhlthau (2004) notes that students are more likely to consult friends,
family, or fellow students than they are to call upon the services of a formal mediator.
Understandably, Kuhlthau argues that this phenomenon is due to weaknesses in
mediation practices, a lack of marketing on the part of librarians, or both. However, as is
8

discussed in further detail in chapter 2, none of the above research of formal mediation
practices explicitly provides evidence that librarians are better guides for all information
seekers and all information search needs than are informal mediators. In addition, when
Kuhlthau’s work on mediation is considered in the light of work in the field of critical
information literacy, it seems possible that her dichotomy of formal and informal
mediators may not be a very useful tool for understanding what exactly happens in a
search mediation encounter.
For instance, Tsai’s (2012) exploratory survey of undergraduates’ use of their
social networks in information search mediation suggests the reverse of Kuhlthau’s
model—that students actually find informal mediation encounters more helpful and
informative than consulting a librarian. When Tsai’s findings are considered in the light
of O’Connor’s (2006, 2009a; b; c) critiques of the theoretical foundations of information
literacy, the value of formal search mediation in student academic success may not be as
strong as academic librarians or higher education administrators have assumed. In an era
where tightened funding and changing institutional priorities are leading administrators
and stakeholders to critique long-established practices within higher education, scholars
and practitioners of information literacy and search mediation would be well advised to
turn a critical lens on their own assumptions and practices. This dissertation serves as a
modest first step in this necessary discussion.
Section Summary
Far from a matter that only concerns academic librarians, information literacy
influences and is influenced by issues related to educational leadership, public policy, and
the organizational environment of a university and higher education as a whole. Library

9

directors seeking to educate university officials about the value of information literacy to
the institution must, as Oakleaf (2010) urges, understand and assess the ways that
information literacy influences and is influenced by all of the considerations above. More
specifically, librarians contend that the information literacy instruction and formal search
mediation services they provide are the best method of instructing students in the
information-seeking skills they need to succeed. However, recent critiques of information
literacy’s theoretical foundations and new information about students’ search mediation
preferences suggest that the value of information literacy, and the librarian-perceived
dichotomy of informal versus formal search mediation, may not be as self-evident as it
appears at first glance.
Problem Statement
Scholars of information literacy such as Kuhlthau (1991; 1993; 2004), Limberg &
Sundin (2006), McKenna (2009), and Shah & Kitzie (2012) contend that information
seekers’ interactions with search mediators, particularly formal mediators such as
librarians, play an important role in assisting seekers to overcome the common
experience of uncertainty and to successfully navigate the information search process.
However, those same scholars observe that even when aware of the availability and
merits of asking librarians for help, students seem to consistently select and engage with
mediators in ways that appear to experts to be relatively ineffective for learning how to
navigate the information search process. This “perplexing and enigmatic state” of affairs
(Clark, D. L, Guba, & Smith, 1977, p. 7) suggests that current literature on the
information search process and information search mediation may not fully or accurately
depict the aspects of search mediation that are actually the most important to students

10

who are performing an information search. An in-depth study of students’ experiences of
search mediation encounters and their perceptions of the role of mediation encounters
within the information search process as a whole could shed light on this problem. A
resolution to this perceived problem could provide guidance for librarians seeking to
better serve students, and for theorists and researchers attempting to understand how
search mediation encounters help students navigate the thoughts, feelings, and actions of
the information search process.
Purpose Statement
The purpose of this study was to explore lower-division undergraduate students’
thoughts, feelings, and actions as they engaged in and reflected on their information
search mediation encounters over the course of a course-related information search
process.
Research Questions
Based on the research problem and purpose, this study explored two main research
questions.
1. What are the characteristics of information search mediation encounters as
experienced by lower-division undergraduate students?
2. How do students use search mediation encounters to navigate the information
search process?
Overview of Research Methodology
This dissertation is a qualitative multiple case study (Stake, 2006) of the lived
information search experiences of Composition II students, a class in which informationseeking tasks are often part of course requirements. Creswell (2007) states that a

11

qualitative research design is called for when research questions can only be answered
via an in-depth exploration of a human issue or concern too complex, sensitive, or poorly
understood to be examined with a simple survey or experiment. More specifically, Stake
(2006) contends that a researcher should consider a multiple case study design when the
questions are concerned with comparing and contrasting multiple experiences with or
examples of a particular “program, phenomenon, or condition”, which Stake calls a
“quintain” (p. 6). Various entities or individuals who experience or enact the quintain are
considered cases within the boundaries of the multiple case study. A case study
researcher will gather a wide variety of qualitative data on each case in order to
understand it as fully as possible. Once the researcher believes they have a good
understanding of each case in isolation, the researcher will then consider the cases in
relationship with each other. This cross-case analysis of multiple manifestations of the
quintain serves to develop insights grounded in multiple cases that will lead to a greater
understanding of the quintain.
As described in the research problem, purpose, and questions, this study is chiefly
concerned with understanding undergraduate students’ information search mediation
encounters; both the students’ experiences of these encounters, and the ways in which
these various encounters may change a student’s experience of an information search as a
whole. For that reason, I explored the quintain of this study, search mediation encounters,
through the lens of several different cases. Each case is one student’s experience of a
single information search as defined by Kuhlthau (2004), spanning from the initial
selection of a topic to the submission of the completed assignment to the student’s
instructor. The case study was conducted with current and recent Composition II students

12

at a community college system in the Southern United States. This overview of the
methodology will provide an introduction to the underlying epistemology and data
collection and analysis methods of the study. More detail on the theoretical framework,
methodology, and methods can be found in chapter 3.
Epistemology and Theoretical Perspective
Following tenets of pragmatic constructionism influenced by both Dewey (1933)
and Bourdieu (1977), I contend that people come to understand concepts most effectively
through experience and social interactions. I also assert that the experience of engaging
with the outside world can sometimes effect change in the object being interacted with as
well as the subject attempting to make sense of the outside world through such
engagement with people and ideas. In addition, different and equally valid interpretations
of reality may emerge depending on the perspective of and theoretical lenses employed
by viewers. For this reason, knowledge is often constructed and codified through social
processes and group consensus, based on how well it describes or influences events in the
outside world. As J. A. Anderson (1996) describes in his discussion of pragmatic
constructionism, “Belief advances to knowledge according to its public success” (p. 40).
Symbolic Interactionism is the theoretical perspective that informs the study. As
Crotty (1998) notes, a theoretical perspective provides a context and key assumptions
about how the world works. The perspective, in turn, implicitly provides a rationale for
the methodology of a study. Interpetivism, or a perspective that “looks for culturally
derived and historically situated interpretations of the social life-world” (p. 66), has
always seemed the obvious choice for exploring students’ lived experiences of particular
information search mediation encounters as well as their experiences of the information
13

search process as a whole. However, interpretivism is almost too broad a perspective to
be helpful in making methodological choices.
As discussed above, the purpose of this study is to explore students’ experiences
of search mediation, and to examine the role those mediation encounters play in the
information search process as a whole. Symbolic interactionism, a philosophical offshoot
of the interpretivist school, is specifically concerned with an actor’s view of a situation,
above all else. By gathering thick, rich descriptions of students’ experiences of
information search encounters, and discussing students’ impressions of the importance of
these encounters within the context of an information search, I engaged in dialogues with
students that allowed me to “become aware of the perceptions, feelings, and attitudes of
others and interpret their meanings and intent” (Crotty 1998, p. 75-6).
Theoretical Framework
Research studies often employ theoretical frameworks as part of their design, in
order to provide a starting point to determine whether new research can provide
confirmation or complication to an existing model of the issue under examination. As a
priori frameworks, these theories influence design and guide research questions, and they
are pre-selected (prior to data collection) for use in data analysis. The research problem,
purpose, and questions are grounded in a review of the literature of information seeking,
search uncertainty, and mediation. Kuhlthau’s (1991; 2004) Information Search Process
model, in particular, was used to frame the boundaries and stages of the information
searches to be studied. Stake (1995) argues persuasively for eschewing an a priori
theoretical framework in a case study design when research questions are directed toward
exploring and understanding a broader social sciences issue (p. 16-17). Instead of framing

14

the study within the parameters of an existing model, the ways that the issue influences
and is influenced by the case should serve as the starting point for design and analysis.
However, the exploratory, participant-driven nature of the study allowed the data I
collected to lead me to a final decision about an appropriate theoretical lens for exploring
my findings about students’ search mediation experiences, rather than the other way
around. Upon reflecting on the findings of my study, I determined that the ACRL
Framework of Information Literacy (2015) could serve as a useful framework for
analyzing and discussing potential implications of the findings of my study. On a note of
clarification, I will capitalize the word Framework when discussing the ACRL
Framework for Information literacy, but present it in lower case when I am discussing
theoretical frameworks in general.
Data Collection and Analysis Procedures
The study took place at Urban Community College (UCC), a community college
system in the southern United States that consists of four main campuses, numerous
outreach centers, and high school concurrent enrollment programs in school districts
within the Urban Metropolitan area and its surrounding suburbs. UCC is actually the only
public institution in this city where students can complete lower division coursework, and
draws an extremely diverse population of recent high school graduates from the local
school districts taking advantage of a tuition assistance program as well as nontraditional
students returning to school. UCC markets itself as a first step to a college education, and
this was reflected in the fact that seven of the eight students in this study mentioned that
their goal was to transfer on to another institution to complete a bachelor’s degree or even
graduate work.
15

Upon successful Institutional Review Board approval and gaining entry to
observe 2-3 sections of Composition II during the writing process of a major research
assignment, I began the data gathering process. I gathered numerous forms of data for the
study, including participant interviews and drawings, classroom observations, library and
computer lab observations, statements from informants aside from interview participants,
and documents and artifacts. Throughout my time shadowing classes, I observed the
students in several different work environments. I used ethnographic methods to take
detailed field notes, and gathered statements from informants such as students and
mediators involved in encounters that I observed in class, at the library, and in informal
study situations. As soon as possible after completion of the assignment, eight students
participated in 30-45 minute open-ended, semi-structured qualitative interviews regarding
their search mediation experiences and the information search process as a whole. After
completing the interview protocol. I then asked each student to take 10-15 minutes to
draw an image or images depicting their mediation and information-seeking experiences
(Kearney & Hyle 2004). Upon the completion of this exercise, I asked the student to
explain these drawings, and asked clarifying questions which emerged from their
drawings and descriptions. In addition to observations and interviews, I gathered course
syllabi, assignment descriptions, and copies of student notes, drafts, and completed
assignments. I assured anonymity of participants by assigning each interview participant
a pseudonym as well as acquiring informed consent from all interview participants. I
gathered no names during observation sessions.
Stake’s (2006) discussion of multiple case study methods served as a roadmap for
my data analysis. Stake suggests approaching a multiple case study in two separate

16

phases; the creation of individual case reports that examine each case in isolation,
followed by a cross-case analysis. These two steps are performed in chapters 4 and 5 of
my dissertation. Chapter 6, the final chapter of my dissertation, consists in part of a third
step, an examination of the cross-case assertions through the lens of the ACRL
Framework for Information Literacy (Association of College and Research Libraries,
2015). Following the examination of this study’s findings through the lens of this
theoretical framework, I close this dissertation with an exploration and discussion of the
potential implications of my findings for theory, research, and practice. Further details
about data collection and analysis are available in chapter 3.
In order to ensure that the findings are credible, transferable, dependable, and
confirmable (Lincoln & Guba, 1986), the study included negative case analysis,
triangulation between multiple data sources, member checking of transcripts, peer
debriefing, thick description, and a reflexivity journal in order to bolster the
trustworthiness of the findings. I will discuss the details of these and other techniques that
will be used to validate the trustworthiness of the study in chapter 3.
Definitions of Key Terms
The following technical terms related to Library and Information Studies,
information literacy, and information seeking will be used throughout this dissertation.
• Information: Anything an individual notices about oneself or reality (Case, 2012,

p. 5).
• Information Literacy: The abilities involved in identifying a need for information,

seeking information efficiently, evaluating its appropriateness, and using it
effectively and ethically (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000).
17

Note that this term will be presented in the text in lower case, unless part of a
larger title such as Critical Information Literacy or the ACRL Framework for
Information Literacy.
• Information Seeking: Generally considered a subset of skills within the larger

curriculum of information literacy, information seeking is any activity undertaken
to gather needed information (Case, 2012, p. 6).
• Uncertainty: a commonly experienced cognitive state that often inspires potentially

troublesome emotions of confusion and frustration for information seekers
negotiating the information search process (Kuhlthau, 1993).
• Information Search Mediation: A process where an information seeker consults

another person who they believe has the ability to guide them through the vague
thoughts and emotions of information search uncertainty (Kuhlthau, 2004).
• Formal Mediators: librarians and instructors of the course for which the

information search is being conducted. (Kuhlthau, 2004)
•

Informal Mediators: family, friends, colleagues, and subject matter experts aside
from instructors or professors. (Kuhlthau, 2004)
Significance of the Study
The significance of this study can be discussed within the three major areas of

research, theory, and practice.
Significance to Research
All searches for information, by definition, are fueled by an information seeker’s
lack of knowledge on a topic, a deficit often called information uncertainty. Kuhlthau
(1993) defined uncertainty as a commonly experienced cognitive state that often inspires
18

potentially troublesome emotions of confusion and frustration for information seekers
negotiating the information search process. According to Kuhlthau (1993), the experience
of grappling with and overcoming uncertainty is central to successful navigation of
information seeking.
On the surface, it seems reasonably logical to argue, as Kuhlthau (2004) does, that
formal mediation can help students who may be “calling out for help in the midst of the
uncertainty and confusion of the earlier stages” (p. 89) of the information search process.
However, as will be discussed in chapter 2, there is a relative dearth of empirical
evidence for this claim. In addition, the clear binary dichotomy between formal and
informal mediators that Kuhlthau suggests may be too simplistic to capture the complex
reality of the lived experience of an encounter between a student and a person whom he
or she has approached for help in finding information. This qualitative study, based on
examining the details of students’ experiences of interactions, rather than codifying the
hierarchy of mediator or encounter “types”, serves as a foundation of a new line of
inquiry into the social aspects of the information search process.
Significance to Theory
As discussed earlier in this chapter, this study explored students’ search mediation
experiences through a theoretical framework that attempts to describe the process by
which students become more critically conscious seekers of information. Although
Critical Information Literacy is emerging as an important framework within the literature
of information seeking and information literacy, it is still at best an emerging body of
literature, not a model of information literacy per se. The same can be said to a lesser
degree of the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy (2015), which draws on

19

Critical Information Literacy as well as other areas of information literacy. While
providing some theoretical detail and definitions of aspects of information literacy as a
whole, the Framework is more prescriptive than descriptive. This study could serve as a
depiction of the ways that students gain critical consciousness of information searching
through the process of collaborating with mediators, and could also provide an early
comparison between the ACRL Framework's threshold concepts and students' lived
information-seeking experiences.
Significance to Practice
As discussed above, librarians and library directors argue that information literacy
and the formal search mediation services provided by librarians give students the skills
needed to locate and evaluate information in a complex world (Chen, Hirumi, & Zhang,
2007; Ross & Hurlbert, 2004; Williamson & Gregory, 2010; Kuhlthau, 2004; Limberg
and Sundin, 2006; McKenna, 2009; Shah and Kitzie, 2012). However, the dearth of
conclusive evidence proving the superiority of formal mediation as well as students’
tendencies to prefer consultation with informal mediators undermines this assertion (Tsai,
2012). Lynch, et al’s (2007) exploration of administrators’ attitudes toward the role of the
academic library in higher education indicates that many provosts and presidents are
starting to question the long-term centrality of the academic library. Even library scholars
such as Elmborg (2006, 2010, 2012) and O’Connor (2006; 2009a; 2009b; 2009c) have
critiqued the strength of librarians’ arguments for their relevance. Gaining a clearer
understanding of what students experience during information search mediation
encounters could enable librarians to more fully understand how their practices enable

20

students to become more capable and critical information seekers, and to make changes
to practice where necessary.
Section Summary
By gaining a clearer understanding of students’ lived experiences of search
mediation, researchers may find this study useful as a starting point for future exploration
of other social aspects of information seeking. Theoreticians may be able to use them to
strengthen a weak spot in current models, and practitioners may be able to design more
effective pedagogy and curricula. Like all other activities in life, information seeking
takes place within a broader social context. A fuller understanding of students’
motivations and choices when seeking out search mediation can only serve to strengthen
information literacy theory, research, and practice.
Boundaries of the Study
The study took place within the following boundaries. First, the research was
conducted within the methodological confines of a qualitative multiple case study, as
defined in more detail in chapter 3. The study was conducted at a single institution, an
urban four-campus community college system. The study explored a single issue,
information search mediation, as part of and as influence upon a student’s information
search process for a course assignment. Each student’s information search process, as
defined by the model developed by Kuhlthau (1991, 1993, 2004) is considered a case for
the purposes of the study. The study is also bound by time, as data was gathered during
the spring 2015 semester. Finally, this study only examines the experiences of students’
course-related mediation encounters related to their assignments in Composition II.

21

Conclusion and Organization of the Study
The theory and practice of information seeking, as a foundational aspect of
information literacy, is relevant to student academic success, as well as to leadership,
public policy, and the organizational environment of higher education. Although
librarians contend that students are best served by consulting formal mediators (i.e.
themselves) for help during an information search, students are much more likely to
prefer consulting what are defined in the literature as informal mediators (Tsai, 2012).
The purpose of this multiple case study was to gain a clearer understanding of
information seekers’ lived experiences of search mediation encounters as well as the
ways those experiences might influence a student’s information search process as a
whole. Such an understanding could help practitioners to design better information
literacy pedagogies and search mediation protocols which could in turn strengthen the
academic library’s ability to serve as a tool to foster student academic achievement.
These findings could also provide researchers with a starting point for exploration of the
social aspects of the information search process. Finally, by examining students’ lived
experiences of search mediation encounters, theorists attempting to build models of
information seeking will be able to draw on these findings to discover how information
search mediation encounters influence the ways in which students become skilled and
critical information seekers. Chapter 2 will consist of a review of literature relevant to
the study. The review will focus on models of the information search process,
information seekers’ experiences of uncertainty, the role of formal and informal
mediators in alleviating uncertainty, and the emerging framework of Critical Information
Literacy, including three prospective theoretical lenses that attempt to incorporate aspects

22

of critical information literacy into research, theory, and practice. Chapter 3 will describe
the multiple case study methodology and the research problem, purpose, and questions,
as well as methods for gathering data, generating findings through data analysis, and
ensuring the credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability of the study.
Chapters 4 and 5 will present the case reports and cross-case assertions respectively, and
will be followed by a discussion and an exploration of those findings in Chapter 6.

CHAPTER II

REVIEW OF LITERATURE

The literature review will explore current scholarship in the field of information
seeking. This review will open with a discussion and critique of the key theoretical
models within the realm of information seeking, with a particular focus on Carol
Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process (ISP) model (Kuhlthau, 1988a; b; c; 1989; 1991;
2004; Kuhlthau, Heinstrom, & Todd, 2008). The second part of this review will explore
the theoretical and empirical literature of information search uncertainty. Scholars of
information seeking such as Kuhlthau and Nicholas Belkin (1978, 2005) consider an
information seeker’s sense of uncertainty to be the driving force that both inspires a
person to seek information and drives that person through the process.
Many information seekers consult multiple resources to resolve their search
uncertainty, particularly intermediaries such as librarians, subject matter experts, and
friends. The third section of this chapter will explore the literature of information search
mediation, with emphasis on the dichotomy between formal and informal mediation
encounters. Interestingly, the emerging field of critical information literacy, a subfield of
Freire’s (1970) critical pedagogy, may complicate long-held assumptions surrounding the
relative values of formal and informal search mediation for undergraduates’ information
searching. The fourth section will discuss the literature of critical information literacy

24

and its possible implications for the study, with particular focus on Olson-Kopp and
Kopp’s (2010) description of critically conscious information seeking and Elmborg's
(2010) model of multiple information literacies. The fifth and final section of the review
will consist of a brief overview of the new (2015) ACRL Framework for Information
Literacy, which I use as a theoretical lens to examine the findings of this study. The
review concludes with a summary and discussion of this study’s potential for resolving
the contradiction between search mediation literature and the arguments of critical
information literacy scholars.
Understanding Information Seeking
This section of the review consists of an exploration of key information-seeking
models, as well as an overview of literature exploring undergraduates’ informationseeking experiences. It will utilize Case’s (2012) definitions of information and
information seeking. Case defines information broadly, as anything an observer notices,
whether about him or herself, or within the environment. He also notes that at times, an
individual will perceive that they have an information need, meaning that they lack
needed information to achieve a goal. An individual will typically attempt to satisfy an
information need through information seeking.
Key Models of Information Seeking
According to S.R. Ranganathan’s seminal (1931, reprinted 2006) work defining
the mission and goals of 20th century librarianship, the mission of libraries, and by
extension librarians, is to connect users with the information they need as efficiently as
possible. This mission is encapsulated in the five laws of librarianship, which continue to

25

serve as a widely-cited statement of principles for the profession (Crawford & Gorman,
1995; Stegmann & Kretschmer, 2013):
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Books are for use.
Every reader his or her book.
Every book its reader.
Save the time of the reader.
The library is a growing organism (Ranganathan et al., 2006; pp. 1, 75,
299, 337, & 382).

Since 1931, scholars of the five laws have modified them somewhat, typically
replacing the term “book” with “information” (Barner, 2011). That said, Raganathan’s
laws remain a key topic in introductory classes at most library schools, and the broader
message of the five laws is still heeded by librarianship as a profession. The laws are
tacitly or explicitly considered in matters related to collection development, library
instruction, and even marketing (Barner, 2011; Bhatt, 2011; Stegmann & Kretschmer,
2013).
In Ranganathan’s era, the chief stumbling block that stood between a user and his
or her information was typically a lack of access to information. Almost all published
information was found in the form of print books and periodicals, which were scarce and
often expensive, particularly if a reader needed complex technical or scholarly
information for educational purposes. Given the scarcity and value of information, library
materials were often stored in closed stacks, and only a chosen few scholars had the
privilege of using them. However, as times have changed, the struggles facing
information seekers have evolved as well (O’Connor, 2006; Oakleaf, 2010). As anyone
who has ever used a web search engine or a database of scholarly literature is aware,
scarcity of information is typically no longer an issue in most information searches.

26

In order to teach information literacy effectively, librarians and scholars of
information studies have attempted to construct process models of information seeking.
While most models restrict themselves to describing the information behaviors of a
particular type of seeker such as lawyers, healthcare professionals, or patients (e.g.
Baldwin & Rice, 1997; Longo, 2005; Kahlor, 2010), four models attempt to describe the
information-seeking activities of most (if not all) information seekers, while
simultaneously detailing their actions and experiences.
Classifying Seekers’ Actions: The Ellis Model
In his doctoral dissertation, David Ellis (1987) uses the principles of grounded
theory to create a model of the behaviors that students, practitioners and researchers in
social sciences, physical sciences, and education perform while seeking information. He
refined his model in two later (1989, 1993) articles. Unlike most earlier models, such as
the one devised by Robertson (1977) which conceived of information seeking as a single
straight line, Ellis envisioned an information seeker, who, upon starting a search, would
choose among several types of actions depending on his or her interests and the
conventions of the field of study.
Ellis (1989) identified several different types of information-seeking actions
common to academic information seekers, though the emphases on each varied by
discipline and level of scholarly expertise. Chaining is a process where an information
seeker might follow citations, hyperlinks, or other references in one source to find other
pertinent information. Seekers also typically spent time browsing in areas of general
interest and monitoring those sources for new information. After differentiating between
sources to find the ones of greatest use, the researcher would then extract the information

27

required to fulfill a given need. Different disciplines described these phases in slightly
different terms or emphasized them differently, but the same general actions were
observed in interviews and search diaries of researchers in a variety of disciplines.
Thinking About Information: The Bates (1989) and Wilson (1981, 1999) Models
For Ellis (1989), information seekers emphasized a particular action or set of
actions depending on the field in which they were researching. Marcia Bates (1989),
whose work was grounded in aspects of Ellis’s model published earlier the same year,
takes Ellis’ work a step further. Bates contends that information seekers’ choices of next
actions, as well as the goals of the search itself, could and did change depending on the
information a researcher found over the course of the search.
In a shift from Ellis’s (1987, 1989, 1993) stationary seeker selecting information
search behaviors from a buffet of possible actions, Bates (1989) describes information
seeking as a meandering stroll through an information landscape. A seeker might take a
particular search action, which would reveal a piece of information relevant to the goal of
the search. However, the seeker then typically thinks about the information and its new
implications for the seeker’s original topic or question. This cognitive process in turn can
lead to changes in both the information being sought and the tactics of the search itself.
The interplay between seeking information and thinking about the information found can
be described as a meandering process of “berrypicking” (p. 407), in which the seeker and
the information he or she seeks change each other in unexpected ways.
Wilson’s (1981, 1999) models of information-seeking behavior also overtly
incorporate the role of cognition during information seeking. In Wilson’s first (1981)
model, he conceives of information seeking as a feedback loop, in which a users’

28

satisfaction (or lack thereof) with the information uncovered informs future search
activities. Uniquely, Wilson considered the role of other people in his model. Although
most models simply focus on the role of information sources in the search process,
Wilson particularly notes the role of information exchange between people as a crucial
aspect of thinking about the information discovered and constructing knowledge out of
that information (1981, p. 5).
Wilson’s attempts to create a model that captured all aspects of the informationseeking experience continued for nearly two decades. In a refinement of his model,
Wilson (1999) contends that a searcher’s actions and thoughts during the search process
are determined in part by the searcher’s context and prior experiences. In addition, a
searcher is influenced by personal, psychological, demographic, role, and environmental
variables, as well as the characteristics of sources themselves. Although critics such as
Niedźwiedzka (2003) contend that Wilson erred in conceiving of a searcher’s context as
something that should be fully separated from the searcher him or herself, Wilson is still
one of the first theorists of information seeking to consider the social and contextual
nature of information seekers’ actions and thoughts. Kuhlthau would build further on
Wilson’s model by adding seekers’ affective experiences during a search to her
conception of information seeking.
Kuhlthau’s Model of the Information Search Process (ISP)
Carol Kuhlthau (1991, 1993, 2004; Kuhlthau, Heinström & Todd, 2008)
considered the interplay between actions and cognition described by Bates (1989) and
Wilson (1981, 1999), and added a third layer of complexity. In so doing, Kuhlthau
created a model that has become the standard for nearly all information-seeking research

29

over the past 20 years. Kuhlthau conceptualized information seeking as an ongoing,
constructivist process (2004, p. 6). Based on two decades of qualitative and quantitative
research, Kuhlthau (2004) built and refined a widely used model to conceptualize
searchers’ experiences of information seeking.

Figure 1. Model of the Information Search Process (Kuhlthau, 2004, used with
permission of the author)
A model of the information search process. Kuhlthau (2004) explored
students’ experiences of information seeking in the light of seminal pragmatic
constructivist educational and psychological theorists Dewey (1933), Kelly (1963), and
Bruner (1973). In her model, the Information Search Process (ISP) is a six-stage journey
of search initiation, topic selection, exploration of the topic, formulation of understanding
from the information gathered, collection of additional pertinent information, and
presentation of the acquired information. Finally, the information seeker reflects on and
assesses his or her experiences, and uses the lessons learned in later information-seeking
projects. In each stage of the process, information seekers typically feel different
emotions, grow in their cognitive understanding of a topic, and undertake different search
activities and strategies. In Kuhlthau’s model of a successful search (figure 1), students
30

move from emotions of anxiety to feelings of accomplishment, from actions of topic
exploration to documenting pertinent information, and from a vague to a clear cognitive
understanding of their topic.
Verifying the ISP model. As discussed above, Kuhlthau developed her
preliminary (1988a) version of the ISP in a qualitative study of a small group of high
school students. Kuhlthau then embarked on a two-track research process that allowed
her to simultaneously refine her model and verify whether it might be generalizable to
other contexts. In one thread of research, Kuhlthau (1989) expanded her focus by
administering a set of surveys to a larger group of high school students at different
achievement levels, and expanded it further by surveying public, school, and academic
library users at numerous sites (Kuhlthau, Turock, George, & Belvin, 1990). With no
statistically significant differences discovered, the model generally held true for all
groups surveyed.
In addition, Kuhlthau wanted to determine if individuals’ information-seeking
processes changed over time. In two studies, Kuhlthau revisited her original group of
high school students five years later. After examining their current search processes via
the same quantitative surveys used in the large-scale studies (Kuhlthau, 1988b) as well as
through one-hour qualitative interviews (Kuhlthau, 1988c), she determined that the model
remained applicable over time. With minor refinements, the model was published in the
form depicted above (Kuhlthau, 1991), and discussed in further detail in Kuhlthau’s
seminal (2004) Seeking Meaning, which has become a standard text in librarianship
exploring issues related to the ISP.

31

As described above, much of Kuhlthau’s work was done in an academic context.
However, researchers have found the model applicable to children (Druin, Foss,
Hutchinson, Golub, & Hatley, 2010), pregnant women seeking information for health
care decisions (Lagan, Sinclair, & Kernohan, 2010), tourists (Ho, Lin, & Chen, 2012),
and even city managers (Saastamoinen, Kumpulainen, Vakkari, & Jarvelin, 2013).
However, most of the empirical research performed with Kuhlthau’s model has been
done in the realm of information-seeking activities in secondary and higher education.
For the purposes of this review, I present a deeper analysis of recent works that have
applied Kuhlthau’s work to the realm of undergraduate information seeking.
Applications of the ISP Model in the Undergraduate Context
In addition to other skills, an information literate student must be able to define an
information need, efficiently search for information that addresses that need, and
critically evaluate that information for potential inclusion in his or her knowledge base
(Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000). Given the increasing emphasis on
information literacy instruction in the mission and activities of academic libraries
(O’Connor, 2009a; b; c), academic librarians, especially those involved in teaching
undergraduates, have developed a growing corpus of research on undergraduate
information behavior as viewed through the lens of the ISP.
Much like the three-pronged nature of Kuhlthau’s model, empirical studies of
information seeking from the last decade seem to fall into three general categories. First,
researchers such as Whitmire (2003), Holliday and Li (2004) and Daniel (2013) explore
students’ thoughts regarding information searching, particularly the influences of
personal epistemology (Hofer & Pintrich, 2004), metacognition, and the ways that

32

students think about the information that they find. In the second (and largest) strand of
literature, researchers examine students’ skills with the actions of information seeking,
particularly in the stages of exploration, formulation, and collection. Finally, librarians
have recently become more interested in students’ emotions during the ISP, particularly
anxiety, frustration, and the happiness and relief that often results as an information
search becomes more focused and productive.
Whitmire (2003) is among the first to examine the influence of personal
epistemology on information search, by drawing on models of epistemological
development as well as Kuhlthau’s (1991; 2004) ISP. Upon interviewing 20 Ivy League
undergraduates engaged in their senior projects, Whitmire found that students’ personal
epistemologies influenced their information search processes in several ways. First,
students with lower epistemological beliefs took a less active role in selecting their
project topics, often deferring to the suggestions of their advisors. High-level
epistemological believers, in addition to determining and refining their own topics, were
also more likely to consult search mediators such as librarians, experts, and peers.
Students with well-developed epistemologies also tended to attempt a wider variety of
search strategies. Finally, students with more highly-developed epistemologies reported
that they had the ability to evaluate and critically engage with the sources they found.
In a similar vein, Holliday and Li (2004) and Daniel (2013) explore the cognitive
information search experiences of millennial-aged college students. Although the studies
were conducted a decade apart from each other, the authors tell similar stories. The
authors of both articles note students’ increased tendency to turn to the web and stop
seeking information once they have “enough”, whether or not they have a full

33

understanding of the topic. They advise librarians consider new tactics in instruction,
particularly an increased focus on teaching students how to move beyond a surface
understanding of their topics to a deeper critical engagement with the subject matter.
Mestre (2006) affirms Holliday and Li’s (2004) arguments by urging instructors
and instruction librarians to recognize and accommodate different learning styles in order
to remain relevant in a digital information age. However, Becker (2009) argues that the
rise of the digital native college student is greatly exaggerated. Based on his studies of
community college students, students do not turn to the first hits they find on Google
simply out of convenience. Instead, he concludes that students lack not only the skills and
comfort level needed to engage with library sources and mediators, but also an
understanding of critical source evaluation needed to effectively evaluate and synthesize
sources from the web. Based on this exploration of students’ cognitive approaches to
information seeking, it seems possible that different explanations may hold true for
different students. These differences seem to be related to both the level of personal
epistemology students have developed, and their facility with the tools and actions of
searching itself.
In a finding that comes as little surprise to instruction librarians who work with
first year classes and students, most students come to college with limited knowledge of
the skills and actions required to successfully complete an information search
(Mittermeyer, 2005). Given that most instruction librarians must provide a foundation in
the basics of searching in a one-hour instruction session, a large body of literature has
emerged exploring the best pedagogical and theoretical tactics for bringing students up to
speed rapidly. Such tactics include the use of constructivist teaching methods (Sizemore

34

& Marcum, 2008), embedded instruction tutorials and services in online courses (S. Clark
& Chinburg, 2010; York & Vance, 2009), and even teaching Kuhlthau’s Information
Search Process itself to students (Mortimore, 2010; Kracker 2002; Kracker & Wang
2002). Each of the studies mentioned above addresses different aspects of information
literacy pedagogy and curriculum. However, when the literature of teaching search skills
is taken as a whole, it becomes clear that librarians must carefully determine a limited
number of the most important skills to teach new information seekers, or risk leaving
them more confused and emotionally overwhelmed than when they entered the library or
began reviewing a tutorial or research guide.
As discussed above, Kuhlthau’s most important contribution to the understanding
of the information-seeking process may well have been the inclusion of students’
emotional experiences in her Information Search Process model (1991; 2004). Several
researchers have focused their efforts on gaining a clearer understanding of information
seekers’ emotions, particularly the anxiety, confusion, frustration and doubt that can stop
a searcher in his or her tracks (S. Clark, 2014). In a series of two (Kracker, 2002; Kracker
& Wang, 2002) articles, Kracker explores both the quantitative and qualitative effects of
an informational lecture on the ISP (and its inherent uncertainty) on the anxiety level of
undergraduate students. The quantitative surveys suggested that students who heard the
lecture felt decreased anxiety about their searching abilities. However, these students
were more likely than the control group to report feelings of anxiety and uncertainty in
their post-assignment paragraphs. Kracker suggests that this reported increase in anxiety
may reflect the group’s awareness, gained through information provided in the lecture, of
the potential for negative emotions rather than any inherent emotional response.

35

By performing a content analysis of student essays and administering instruments
that measure anxiety and critical thinking abilities, Kwon (2008) determined that critical
thinking (a cognitive aspect of information seeking) and search anxiety actually influence
each other throughout the search process. Although all students reported a great deal of
anxiety in the opening stages of the search process, students who reported high levels of
critical thinking skills also demonstrated low levels of anxiety as information seeking
progressed. In a similar vein to Kwon's identification of the interplay of cognitive and
affective dimensions within the search process, Denison and Montgomery (2012) note a
connection between the emotions of seekers and the actions they take during the search.
The authors contend that students occasionally knowingly select less reliable information
from a website over resources available in library databases, even though they state they
have the skills needed to find library resources. These students state that they
occasionally opt for information that is good enough, simply because they find Google a
less emotionally frustrating experience than a library database.
In the diagram of Kuhlthau’s information search process (fig. 1), students’
thoughts, behaviors, and emotions are depicted as three parallel lines. However, the
research on affective aspects of information searching strongly indicates that each of the
three realms of information seeking influence the others. Kuhlthau herself notes this
dynamic in her (2004) in-depth monograph exploring the ISP in fine detail. According to
Kuhlthau (1993), the complexities of the interrelationships between thoughts, feelings,
and actions of information seeking can best be understood by gaining a clearer
understanding of a searcher’s perspective on the process itself. In addition to the
thoughts, actions, and emotions experienced during the search process, searchers reported

36

experiences of uncertainty about the topic and about the best strategies for engaging in
the ISP itself. Uncertainty seems to be the force that both influences a seeker to begin
looking for information, and accelerates or stymies a seeker’s progress toward the
successful completion of an information search.
Uncertainty as a Force in the Information Search Process
In addition to developing the Information Search Process, Carol Kuhlthau was
one of the first major scholars of information literacy, along with Nicholas Belkin (1978,
2005), to describe uncertainty as a key force at play during information seeking.
Although Belkin conceives of uncertainty as a force that serves primarily to instigate an
information search, Kuhlthau (1993; 2004) argues that uncertainty, while strongest in the
earliest stages of the ISP, can potentially reemerge at any point until the completion of a
search.
Kuhlthau’s Principle of Uncertainty
In an early (1993) article, Kuhlthau defined uncertainty as a commonly
experienced cognitive state that often inspires potentially troublesome emotions of
confusion and frustration for information seekers negotiating the information search
process. According to Kuhlthau, the experience of grappling with and overcoming
uncertainty is central to successful navigation of information seeking. In her later (2004)
monograph on information seeking, Kuhlthau discusses the uncertainty principle in
greater detail, and contends that information seekers experience shifts in six factors, or
“corollaries”, including process, formulation, redundancy, mood, prediction, and
momentum. Students' changing experiences of these corollaries may explain the growth
or diminishment of a searcher’s experience of uncertainty.

37

In the process corollary, information seekers combat uncertainty by becoming
more comfortable with the process of constructing understanding and meaning from the
disparate pieces of information gathered in a search. In the formulation corollary, this
increased mastery of the process of making meaning allows students to define their topics
(and by extension their information needs) with more precision. Seekers experience the
redundancy corollary as they progress through the collection stage of the ISP. As seekers
encounter the same material repeatedly, they gain confidence that they have found most
or all of the available information on a topic, reducing uncertainty about whether their
search is on the right track.
A seeker’s mood is obviously an important aspect of successfully managing
uncertainty (Nahl, 2007). Students must have enough comfort with the mood corollary of
uncertainty to approach the literature in an open, invitational stance that enables them to
search broadly, learn new things, and change their topic as circumstances dictate. As the
search continues, a seeker transitions to a more direct or “indicative” mood, as their focus
turns to filling in the blanks of understanding and completing the search for information.
A student’s mood is also helped via growing comfort with the prediction corollary. As
the results of a given action in a search become more predictable, uncertainty lessens.
Finally, a searcher’s sheer interest in a topic can give them the momentum needed to
continue searching in the face of uncertainty, just as a lack of interest can cause them to
abandon a search and move on.
In the early stages of the search process, when understanding is vague at best and
research skills may be at their weakest, searchers face the strongest and most selfdefeating feelings and thoughts of uncertainty and its corollaries, a particularly low

38

moment Kuhlthau calls “The Dip” (2008, p. 68). This uncertainty is only resolved at the
breakthrough between the exploration and formulation stages (Kuhlthau’s stages 3 and
4). In a successful search, the information seeker eventually discovers (and comprehends)
enough information on their topic to begin creating a mental outline of its key issues and
nuances.
When a searcher achieves this moment of insight, his or her topic crystallizes and
takes form in the searcher's brain. This comprehension does more than any library tutorial
or reference interview to dissipate uncertainty, clarify understanding, and empower the
searcher to continue seeking and synthesizing information with increased confidence and
competence. Unfortunately, not all students understand that uncertainty is a common
experience in information search, and not in itself a cause for alarm. Kuhlthau’s (1993)
article closes with a call to librarians to add discussions of the search process to library
instruction in the hopes of alleviating the confusion and anxiety commonly experienced
early in the search process.
Uncertainty as Fuel and Hurdle
Later researchers of undergraduate information seeking explored and verified the
role of uncertainty in the information-seeking process as described by Kuhlthau in 1993
and elaborated in later (2004, 2008) work. Genuis (2007) argues that the confusion of the
early stages of the information-seeking process is an inevitable product of the process of
constructing meaning through information seeking that cannot be eased with
foreknowledge. Mäkitalo, Weinberger, Häkkinen, Järvelä, & Fischer (2005) as well as
Brumfield (2008) contend that uncertainty is particularly troublesome in an online course

39

environment, and performed research that showed the utility of tools such as online
tutorials in mitigating uncertainty.
Different students may also experience uncertainty in different ways, and with
different results. For instance, Hyldegård (2006), based on her qualitative investigation of
uncertainty within study groups, argues that uncertainty can arise from or be exacerbated
by factors other than the search itself. The personal factors that each person brings to the
search also influences uncertainty, as does the students’ comfort level with teammates
and the work group dynamic as a whole. In general, Hyldegård contends that the more
comfortable a student feels in the context within which he or she conducts the search, the
less uncertainty will be at play during the search process. Chowdhury and Gibb (2009)
also observe that different populations seem to experience greater or lesser levels of
uncertainty, and even experience different levels of discomfort over their uncertainty.
Humanities students and women, for instance, seem to find uncertainty a larger stumbling
block than do students in engineering and physical sciences.
In a similar vein, Given (2002) and Gold’s (2005) explorations of information
seeking among nontraditional students seems to strengthen Hyldegård’s (2006) and
Chowdhury and Gibb’s (2009) observations. Given (2002) explores the everyday and
academic information-seeking activities of nontraditional students, in an attempt to see
how each sphere might inform the other. Although she did not specifically address issues
like uncertainty and search anxiety that are prominent in Kuhlthau's (1993) model, her
findings reinforce the need for information scholars to avoid the false dichotomy between
information seeking at school and in other aspects of a student's life.

40

Building on Given (2002), Gold (2005) begins with Knowles’ (1980) theory of
Andragogy (pedagogy of adult learning), and constructs a model of information literacy
pedagogy for nontraditional students that she implemented at her university. Gold
contends that a one-size fits all model of information seeking may not accurately capture
the unique emotions, thoughts, and actions that nontraditional students may undertake in
the information process. In turn, if nontraditional students’ traits and characteristics are
not taken into consideration when teaching them how to successfully navigate the
information-seeking process, their academic integration, learning outcomes, and
persistence could be at risk.
The Upside of Uncertainty
Given's (2002) and Gold’s (2005) studies both suggest that experiences of search
uncertainty might complicate a sense of academic integration, and by extension a
student’s persistence in college. However, other scholars of uncertainty contend that
uncertainty, if understood and accepted by an information seeker, can actually lead to a
successful search, and may even be a necessary part of the experience of uncovering new
knowledge. Adams (2010) argues, based on her ethnographic study of the informationseeking activities of millennial-aged undergraduates, that uncertainty can be a positive
force in students’ search activities, as long as students are taught to accept it as a natural
part of the process, and are given tools with which to manage it.
Chowdhury, Gibb, & Landoni (2011) agree with Kuhlthau (1993) regarding the
inevitability of uncertainty. However, they challenge the idea that uncertainty inevitably
diminishes as a searcher collects and presents their findings. Instead, the heightened
learning curve that technology presents for students through both more technical search

41

tools and the information overload inherent to information seeking in a Web 2.0 world
can possibly lead to increased confusion and need for backtracking in the process at any
point in the search process.
Chowdhury, Gibb, & Landoni (2011) contend that uncertainty is an endemic and
possibly inevitable aspect of the information-seeking process. However, some, such as
Nahl (2007) and Berryman (2006; Parker & Berryman, 2007), argue that informationseeking uncertainty is a sign that a student is truly transcending his or her comfort zone of
knowledge and learning new ideas and understandings of the world. However, an
information searcher who is emotionally unnerved by experiences of uncertainty may
choose to end a search early, finding just enough information to satisfy the assignment. A
student must have enough confidence in their abilities and intelligence to work through
this uncertainty and gain deeper understanding of the topic.
In her ethnographic exploration of two professors’ literature searches, T.D.
Anderson (2006) digs more deeply into scholarly researchers’ experiences of search
uncertainty to identify possible distinctions between productive uncertainty that
motivates scholars to learn more about a topic and a paralyzing uncertainty that stops
information seeking in its tracks. Intriguingly, Anderson found that seasoned researchers
experienced uncertainty in both positive and negative forms throughout their literature
searches. However, both their confidence in their information search skills and their
passion for their topics helped them persist through the grey areas of the search process to
successfully gain an understanding of the literature within their topic needed to perform
research.

42

Although T.D Anderson’s (2006) research was performed with trained scholarly
researchers, it seems likely that the themes Anderson identified would hold true for
undergraduate students, particularly when considered in the context of research discussed
earlier in this section. If so, then a student that experiences uncertainty likely will gain a
fuller understanding of the topic by struggling through information-seeking obstacles.
Intriguingly, both Kuhlthau (2004) and Anderson (2006) contend that mediators, or the
people searchers consult for guidance during the search process, often provide the search
skills, cognitive perspective, and emotional support needed for a searcher to use
uncertainty to his or her advantage.
The Role of Mediation Encounters in Resolving Student Uncertainty
Most models of information seeking, with the notable exception of Wilson’s
(1981, 1999) incorporation of context and information transfer among seekers, seem to
envision an individual searcher forging a solitary path towards knowledge. However, as
discussed briefly by T. D. Anderson (2006) and in greater detail by Kuhlthau (2004,
2008) many information seekers turn to others for help in the course of their efforts.
According to Kuhlthau (2004), students often consult mediators to guide them through
their vague thoughts and emotions of confusion. She divides mediators into two types;
informal and formal. Informal mediators can include family members, friends,
colleagues, and subject matter experts (aside from instructors or professors). Formal
mediators are the librarians and faculty members who are students’ official resources for
help when uncertainty arises during the information search process.

43

Librarians Advocate for Formal Mediation
In the course of her research, Kuhlthau became troubled by students’
overwhelming tendency to select informal mediators rather than formal ones in times of
uncertainty (2004, pp. 84-6). Based on her interviews of high school and college students,
Kuhlthau argues that students tend to mostly ask librarians for assistance when they need
help locating a specific source. On the other hand, students turn to informal mediators to
discuss their topics and plan strategies for searching and writing, as well as for emotional
support when the writing process gets hard. Although students stated that consulting a
librarian or instructor too often would make the work less their own, they expressed a
belief that informal mediation encounters strengthened their agency and abilities as
developing information seekers.
That said, some students in Kuhlthau’s (2004) case study stated that they would
have preferred to have been able to have conversations with instructors or librarians like
those they had with informal mediators in the early stages of the search process. For that
reason, Kuhlthau contends that students selected informal mediators not by choice, but
out of a perceived lack of formal support in the earliest phases of the ISP. Kuhlthau
called for a process-based, user-centered model of formal mediation. In her model,
librarians organize a collection for easy navigation, locate requested information, identify
potentially related sources, advise students on the appropriate use of sources, and counsel
students on the high-level process of negotiating uncertainty and constructing meaning
(2004, pp. 114-20).
Subsequent scholars responded to Kuhlthau’s call by developing the scholarship
of formal process-based mediation. Limberg & Sundin (2006) argue that information

44

literacy instructors do not sufficiently incorporate discussion of the types of formal
mediation available to students at the library. McKenna (2009) calls on instruction
librarians to identify technological barriers that stand between students and sources of
formal mediation. Shah & Kitzie (2012) identify ways that librarians can improve formal
mediation in a virtual reference setting, and Fourie (2013) calls on librarians to embrace
Kuhlthau’s zones of intervention (which have received much less attention than her ISP
model) as a model for organizing reference services.
All of these researchers added clarity to the process and promotion of formal
information search mediation. However, none explicitly provides evidence that librarians
are better guides for all information seekers and all information search needs than are
informal mediators. Instead, all seem simply to assume formal mediators are more
effective for or desired by students than informal mediators, beyond a few comments
from Kuhlthau’s (2004) case study participants, which may or may not be transferable to
information seekers in other contexts. Kuhlthau was the first major theorist to approach
information seeking from the students’ perspective. However, Kuhlthau and her
successors did not seem to consider that students’ preference of informal mediation might
be due to factors other than convenience or awareness.
Students’ Preferences for Informal Mediation
In her analysis of undergraduates’ use of their social networks in the course of
information seeking, Tsai (2012) notes that students tend to consult classmates or
teaching assistants when they have course related questions. This is the case even when
course professors are available to approach for help. When the data are examined more
closely, Tsai’s findings are particularly disconcerting for librarians who assert that

45

mediation consultations with them are inherently more helpful than those with friends
and family. The students surveyed by Tsai gave each type of mediator included in the
survey a positive or negative score in the areas of formality, friendliness, helpfulness, and
profoundness (depth) of the mediation encounter. Although librarians acquitted
themselves fairly well on friendliness, and students encounters with them were perceived
as less formal than all other university faculty or staff members, students found them the
sixth least helpful type of mediator out of the twenty types of mediators included in the
survey. It must be noted that Tsai’s survey of 25 undergraduates may not be as
generalizable as a larger survey would be. However, Tsai’s findings are at least as
compelling as Kuhlthau’s small-scale case study of mediation experiences.
When the literature of information search mediation is taken as a whole, it seems
possible that informal mediation encounters may bring their own strengths to the
searcher, particularly when it comes to overcoming the affective hurdles of the search
that so often lead to less productive manifestations of search uncertainty. The discoveries
of information scholars exploring the role of informal mediation encounters in
information seeking are reinforced by the theoretical innovations in the emerging field of
critical information literacy, a recent offshoot of Freire’s (1970) critical pedagogy.
Although the theoretical and empirical literature of critical information literacy is mostly
focused on bringing problem-posing instruction to the information literacy classroom and
the reference interview, Critical Information Literacy implicitly calls the assumed
superiority of formal information search mediation encounters into question.

46

Critical Information Literacy and its Implications for Search Mediation
In my (S. Clark, 2014) exploration of the information-seeking narratives of
nontraditional students, research participant “Ashley” shared a provocative story of an
information search stymied by uncertainty and fear. During a library instruction class she
attended early in the semester, the librarian discussed the multiple ways students could
use library resources and staff to find information more effectively. In addition, Ashley’s
instructor encouraged her students to seek help and provided additional resources for
finding and evaluating appropriate information for scholarly inquiry. Despite all these
available resources, Ashley simply became “blocked” (p. 69), and could not overcome
her anxiety enough to attempt to explore her topic. When asked why she had not
consulted with a formal mediator, Ashley said, “Smart people intimidate me. And people
who are in charge of me” (p. 70).
Paulo Freire and the Origins of Critical Pedagogy
As the founder of critical pedagogy, Paulo Freire would have likely sympathized
with Ashley’s plight, and might have been dubious of information literacy researchers’
calls for increased formal mediation. Freire (1970) argued that pedagogy as traditionally
conceived was little more than a “banking” process. Teachers, as the politically
empowered holders and arbitrators of truth, deposit politically approved knowledge into
purportedly empty students. The students grow in status within this system of education
by accepting the truths offered by the teacher uncritically and quietly (pp. 71-2). Freire
argued that students and teachers alike must reframe a pedagogical structure that
promotes and sustains structures of social and political oppression. Teachers and students
alike can break free of the cycle of oppression by engaging in a “problem-posing

47

dialogue” (p. 80). In Freire’s proposed scenario, all parties are assumed to possess
knowledge that can help others think through and resolve problems, thereby becoming
liberated from intellectual (and eventually, according to Freire, political) oppression.
Critical Pedagogy in the Library
Decades later, Elmborg (2006) examined information literacy theory and practice
through Freire’s (1970) lens. In an article that became the foundation of the rapidly
growing subfield of critical information literacy (Doherty, 2007; Warren & Duckett,
2010; Swanson, 2004; 2011), Elmborg contended that librarians must move beyond
simply teaching the research and source evaluation skills that he termed “the grammar of
information” (p. 197) to encourage students to question both the information they find
and the systems of information management and organization that privilege one type of
information over another. Problem-posing information literacy instruction openly
acknowledges the academic library’s strengths and weaknesses while embracing new
theories of knowledge and learning.
Swanson (2004; 2011) describes such a model in greater detail, combining
Elmborg’s (2006) ideas with earlier theorists of other critical literacies such as Lankshear
& McLaren (1993), Powell, Cantrell, and Adams (2001), and Endres (2001). According
to Swanson (2011), a model of critical information literacy should incorporate six key
elements: different creators construct information to serve different purposes; information
evaluation is a continual process; different readers interpret information differently
depending on their viewpoints; students need many chances to practice information
skills; seek to understand information seekers on their own terms; and, “center libraries
within the curriculum as the experts on overcoming many of the obstacles to conducting

48

successful research in the ever-changing information world” (p. 891, italics added).
Although Swanson’s proposal of the traits of critical information literacy is promising, he
seems to have embedded an assumption that libraries and librarians are the undisputed
“experts” in search mediation.
While not specifically responding to Swanson’s proposed traits of a search
model, O’Connor (2009b) notes that these types of tensions between the pluralist and
neoliberal impulses embedded within the field’s current (Association of College and
Research Libraries, 2010) definition of information literacy ultimately call the coherence
of the construct into question. O’Connor reminds the reader that cultural theorists such as
Foucault (1988) question Dewey’s (1933) pluralist argument that an educated populace
will inevitably lead to a more equitable and functional society as little more than an
idealist dream. O’Connor contends that notions of liberal pluralism ignore the structural
imbalances of power that maintain the status quo, and that pluralists assume that truth is
“an objective, demonstrable reality that everyone can ascertain if they simply draw on
their ability to evaluate information around them critically” (p. 81). In neoliberalism,
education (and by extension information literacy) is conceived of as a means to educate
people in social norms, as well as the skills needed to become economically productive
members of society. Pedagogy of this nature provides less room for students to reflect
and grow intellectually by engaging with information, instead focusing on teaching the
many marketable skills that educators believe students will need in the work force.
Not only does O’Connor (2009c) argue that these two belief systems are mutually
exclusive, she uses critical pedagogy to call both into question. O’Connor then harkens
back to Elmborg’s (2006) critique of most information literacy instruction as merely

49

teaching “the grammar of information” (p. 497), rather than deep intellectual engagement
with the search process and the information that is uncovered over the course of that
process. O’Connor closes the article by arguing that the tensions between pluralist and
neoliberal theoretical perspectives will eventually threaten the theoretical coherence of
information literacy as a construct. She, like Elmborg before her, calls on librarians to
consider Freire (1970) as well as Kuhlthau (1991, 2004), Teivainen's (2000) Radical
Democracy Theory and Langer’s (1997) Model of Mindful Learning to reconceptualize
the construct of information literacy.
In his discussion of the implications of critical information literacy in the
community college context, Patterson (2009) confronts the tension implied in Swanson’s
(2004) model of critical information literacy pedagogy head-on. In a similar vein to
O’Connor (2006, 2009a; b; c), Patterson critiques a paradox he observes within
information literacy theory, which he frames as a conflict between increasing students’
critical thinking about information while also reinforcing traditional ideas about the value
of different types of information. He notes that librarians are often in the position of
providing “free” access to information and information literacy skills on one hand, while
simultaneously locking information within cumbersome, password protected security
systems required by database vendors. Patterson discusses this and other examples as
evidence of librarians’ ongoing struggle to balance the values of mondialization (or a
progressive model of education in O’Connor’s words) and globalization (defined
similarly to O’Connor’s use of Neoliberalism) in information literacy pedagogy and
academic librarianship in general.

50

Patterson counsels librarians to seek a middle way in their practice, in which they
teach students the nuances of the current information landscape, while simultaneously
helping them to develop the critical consciousness needed to critique these power
structures and to create information of their own. Some practitioners may find this critical
pedagogy difficult to adopt, as it requires librarians to have the courage to admit and
critique their own roles in what Freire (1970) called the “banking model of education”.
However, by providing students with the skills and resources necessary to navigate
current systems of information while simultaneously empowering them to critique those
structures (and all others in daily life), Patterson argues that librarians will be enabling
traditionally disadvantaged students to achieve the education and status necessary to
effect transformative changes from within existing power structures.
Ultimately, as Patterson (2009) argues and Accardi, Drabinski, & Kumbier (2010)
also assert in their collection of critical library instruction practices, academic librarians
must discover and acknowledge the limitations of their abilities as mediators. If librarians
are truly committed to a constructivist model of information and intend to guide students
toward becoming liberated and truly critical seekers and evaluators of information, then
scholars and practitioners must have the courage to turn a critical lens on themselves. For
information literacy to continue to make sense as both a professional activity and a
pedagogical tool of enlightenment, academic librarians cannot attempt to have it both
ways.
Building on that implication, it seems unlikely that information seekers categorize
the mediators as “formal” or “informal”. This binary opposition certainly does not
originate in students’ behaviors, but in Kuhlthau’s attempts to build a model of the

51

different levels of formal search mediators. Information seekers’ continuing choices to
consult different mediators in different ways from those that librarians might suggest do
not necessarily indicate a lack of education on the part of students. In fact, upon taking on
the humility recommended by scholars and promoters of critical information literacy it
seems quite possible that information seekers may experience information search
mediation encounters very differently than academic librarians think they do. Although
neither directly discusses search mediation, two recent publications from theorists of
Critical Information Literacy suggest intriguing new ways to understand information
seeking.
Olson-Kopp and Kopp’s traits of a critically conscious information seeker. In
their discussion of the role of library instruction in the development of critical
consciousness, Olson-Kopp and Kopp (2010) describe information literacy instruction as
currently performed within the banking model of education as “a transfer of objects that
fosters the development of skills in the service of others” (p. 56). The authors then draw
on critical pedagogy to critique and reframe this model within a context of a problemposing pedagogy, describing three abilities and stances toward information that would be
key aspects of a critically conscious information-seeking perspective.
First, a critically conscious information seeker has reframed information as a
physical representation of another person’s thoughts and ideas that can be engaged with
and questioned, rather than as a consumer good to be located and passively consumed.
Second, the authors contend that critically conscious information seekers transcend the
mechanistic skills of searching databases and citing sources. They also critically examine
both the social and historical contexts in which given information sources were created,

52

as well as the values that the creator of the information is trying to reproduce or resist in
the work. Finally, critically conscious information seekers perceive themselves as coinvestigators in a search for information, rather than as customers passively absorbing an
information literacy lecture or asking for help at the reference desk with accessing a
source. It is important to note that the authors do not describe these traits as a theoretical
model per se. However, their concept of a critically conscious information seeker could
be a useful lens through which to view the ways in which students experience
information seeking in general, and search mediation encounters specifically.
Olson-Kopp and Kopp (2010) admit that it is particularly difficult to promote the
traits of critically conscious information seeking within the limitations of a one-shot
library instruction session. While the authors go on to describe a problem-based learning
pedagogy that could be implemented in a library instruction session, it seems possible
that these sessions by their very definition might not actually be a conducive environment
for students to become more empowered and critically conscious information seekers.
However, when these traits are viewed in the light of the existing research on search
mediation discussed earlier in this review, it seems possible that one-on-one consultation
with a mediator outside of a classroom context might foster an environment more
amenable to the empowerment of critically conscious information seekers. In the same
year, Elmborg (2010) explores this very issue; discussing ways that reference librarians
can work with information seekers to develop a problem-posing dynamic within one-onone search mediation.
Elmborg’s Multiple Literacies. Early researchers working in the critical
information literacy paradigm such as Olson-Kopp and Kopp (2010) and Swanson (2004;

53

2011) focused on discovering and creating models for what critical information literacy
looks like, and what libraries can do to teach these skills to students. Elmborg (2010), in a
follow-up piece to the 2006 article that effectively launched the paradigm of Critical
Information Literacy, contends that researchers have overlooked the most important
aspect of the development of critical information consciousness—the various cultural
literacies that the student herself brings to the information search. According to Elmborg
(2010), despite scholars' attempts to revise information literacy theories and practices to
incorporate the tenets of critical pedagogy, most research is geared toward understanding
and changing librarians’ practices and teaching objectives. However, Elmborg argues that
emerging theoretical and practical models still neglect two key aspects of Critical
Information Literacy-- the multiple types of knowledge and experiences brought to the
information search by the seeker, and the constructivist process of knowledge creation
that can take place when both seeker and mediator approach a search mediation
encounter as equals, not a teacher and a student.
Elmborg (2010) contends that librarians’ educational mission must go beyond
delivering the ’correct’ information product to a passive library patron, or customer. "To
be clear, I do not advocate that we abolish correctness as a standard, but rather that we
need a human connection with someone, to understand the way they view the world,
where their question or problem is coming from" (p. 74). By digging deeper into a simple
request for information and engaging in a deeper and more equal conversation of the
matter at hand, Elmborg contends that librarians and information seekers can subvert
both the transactional dynamic of their interaction, and the power differentials inherent in
the "banking model" (Freire, 1970) of education.

54

Elmborg (2010) makes three suggestions to reference librarians at the end of his
article, all of which seem relevant to anyone engaging in a mediation encounter with an
information seeker. First, Elmborg suggests that librarians try to close the teacher/student
gap somewhat by respecting the knowledge and perspectives that students bring to a
mediation encounter, and to attempt to turn a one-way information transaction into a twoway conversation in which knowledge is jointly constructed.
Second, rather than making assumptions about the people who ask for help,
librarians should attempt to find out what a person already knows and feels about the
search due to previous search activities as well as any cultural assumptions. A mediator
also needs to take time to ascertain a seeker's proficiency at the searching process itself.
Based on this initial information, mediators can engage with the information seeker at the
seeker's own comfort level, further lessening the power dynamic and addressing a
seeker's search uncertainty in the process.
Finally, librarians need to avoid enforcing their assumptions about the "right" way
to undertake an information search. Rather than focusing on teaching searchers how to
find what they need and to evaluate it properly, librarians should create an environment
where information seekers can effectively learn, and provide guidance where needed on
the journey. This distinction is a subtle one, but Elmborg (2010) argues that it is a crucial
factor in empowering information seekers to take control of their educations.
The ACRL Framework for Information Literacy
Although the literature of critical information literacy has not yet directly
addressed information search mediation, one can perceive a “perplexing and enigmatic
state” (D. L. Clark, Guba, & Smith, 1977, p. 7) in the literature explored above.

55

Mainstream scholars of information seeking such as Carol Kuhlthau (1991, 1993, 2004,
2008) call on librarians to embrace the user’s perspective, while simultaneously urging
them to continue to educate students about the superiority of formal mediators in
combating search uncertainty. However, scholars of information literacy seem to have
overlooked the possibility that uncertain information seekers may find much of value in
informal mediation encounters as well. This oversight is particularly disturbing in the
light of both Critical Information Literacy as well as empirical evidence that librarians
may not be the “expert” mediators that they have assumed they are.
In the spirit of critical information literacy and critical pedagogy, this research
does not focus on librarians’ strengths and weaknesses as mediators, nor on validating or
complicating an a priori model of search mediation. Instead, the study will focus on
exploring the experiences of students who engage in search mediation encounters, and
the role that these experiences play in students’ information search processes. However, I
will examine the cross-case findings of the study through the lens of the new (2015)
ACRL Framework for Information Literacy, in an attempt to understand what light the
Framework may shed on students' information-seeking experiences, and vice versa.
As O’Connor (2006) notes in her historical survey of paradigm shifts in
librarianship since the emergence of library computing systems in the 1980s, information
on nearly any topic, rather than being limited to library collections, is now available to
nearly anyone at a click of a mouse. However, librarians contend that most users lack the
skills needed to define an information need, commonly referred to as information
literacy. In order to be considered information literate, users must be able to efficiently
search for information that addresses the need within a massive pool of data and critically

56

evaluate information for potential inclusion in his or her knowledge base (Association of
College and Research Libraries, 2000). Rather than gaining access to a small and
carefully curated collection of high-quality, highly relevant information, a searcher must
dig through a haystack of data to find one or two needles that will suit his or her needs.
In response to this evolution in information technology, librarians are now
focusing much more time and energy on teaching patrons the information literacy skills
needed to find and evaluate information located in the broader information landscape as
well as within the library building and online resources. In November 2014, the
Association for College and Research Libraries released the final draft of the new
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education, a document intended to
replace the information literacy Standards published in 2000. In an attempt to reframe
information literacy and the pedagogy of library instruction to better meet the needs of
current students, information literacy was redefined as including not only a set of skills,
but a cognitively, emotionally, and practically flexible approach to information seeking
informed by a practice of metacognition, or thinking about one’s thought process (2014c,
p. 2). The ACRL identified six threshold concepts through which college students should
learn to engage with the information environment:
x

Authority Is Constructed and Contextual

x

Information Creation as a Process

x

Information Has Value

x

Research as Inquiry

x

Scholarship as Conversation, and

x

Searching as Strategic Exploration.
57

Some experts, such as Oakleaf (2014) and Swanson (2015), land firmly on the
positive side contending that designing library instruction around threshold concepts
would allow librarians to decrease their focus on the tools of information seeking, and
more time on the higher level skills of information seeking and evaluation. Others, such
as Morgan (2015) and Beilin (2015), voiced concerns about the theoretical rigor of both
the threshold concepts included in the Framework, as well as the underlying foundation
of Threshold Concepts as conceived by Meyer and Land (2003). In addition to scholarly
articles and commentary, the Framework's highly public development process spawned
dozens of blog posts exploring the merits and drawbacks of the draft Framework (e.g.
Berg, 2014; Farkas 2014, 2015; Fister, 2014a; b; Hovious 2014). The debate continued
throughout 2014 in countless tweets in the very active #critlib and #ACRLframework
hashtags, which serve as discussion spaces regarding Critical Information Literacy and
the ACRL Framework respectively. As the development process continued in three drafts
throughout 2014 (a; b; c), the committee incorporated changes to address widespread
confusion about threshold concepts as well as skepticism about their usefulness in
designing and assessing information literacy instruction (Wilkinson, 2014; Townsend,
Lu, Hofer, and Brunetti, 2015).
In the final weeks before the scheduled date for the vote on final adoption of the
Framework in January 2015, more practical concerns emerged. These arguments were
embodied in a widely circulated open letter (Dalal, 2015). In the weeks leading up to the
decision, over 350 academic librarians and scholars of information literacy added their
signatures to the letter, which asked the leadership of ACRL not to discard the 2000
Standards for Information Literacy in place of the Framework. Dalal argued that a hasty

58

retirement of the 2000 Standards would undermine curriculum design and assessment
efforts. Worse, Dalal and the cosigners of the petition contended that abandoning the
Standards for the Framework could potentially damage academic libraries' authority in
the eyes of neoliberal institutions and accrediting bodies.
Ultimately, the Framework was "filed" by the ACRL in January 2015 rather than
fully approved, in order to gather more feedback and determine the best course for future
action. After early engagement with the Framework in contexts that varied from medical
libraries (Knapp and Brower, 2014) to theological seminaries (Badke, 2015) met with
both success and challenges, the Framework was officially adopted by ACRL in January
2016. However, the 2000 Standards were not superseded for the time being. As of this
writing in early 2016, both documents will remain part of the information literacy best
practices of the association for the near future.
The Framework will provide information literacy practitioners and researchers
with a theoretical foundation for understanding information literacy, and the standards
will remain, though eventually in a revised form, as a practical structure for information
literacy curriculum design and assessment which lends itself to ease of understanding for
non-librarian stakeholders. By viewing my findings through the ACRL Framework, I will
provide early insights into the ways the Framework may or may not help students to find
the information they need, and to interact with that information in a critically conscious
way. I will also examine this emerging Framework through the lens of my participants'
lived information-seeking experiences, in an attempt to understand the ways in which the
Framework does and does not describe the lessons students learn through their
experiences of search mediation.

59

Summary
A review of the literature of information seeking demonstrated that there is a lack
of understanding of the roles different types of mediators play during the information
search process. This oversight in the literature, in turn, may be due in part to a paradox
found at the center of academic librarianship’s construction of the concept of information
literacy. This literature review was conducted by consulting key books, journal articles,
and other scholarly literature pertaining to information seeking, uncertainty, search
mediation, and the emerging theory of Critical Information Literacy.
Numerous scholars of information literacy have attempted to build or refine
models of the information-seeking experience, most notably Ellis (1989), Bates (1989),
and Wilson (1981, 1999). However, Kuhlthau’s (1991, 1993, 2004, 2008) model of the
Information Search Process (ISP) has emerged over the past two decades as the most
heavily tested and used model of information seeking, particularly in the context of
student and scholarly information searches. This review provided a summary of the
numerous studies that tested or used Kuhlthau’s model to examine the cognitive, process,
and emotional search experiences of undergraduates.
In the review of this body of empirical literature, it became clear that uncertainty
is the central force that motivates students as they negotiate the ISP. However, as
Kuhlthau (1993) herself notes, uncertainty can be either a motivating or frustrating force
in the course of information seeking, depending on how a seeker experiences and
manages the corollaries of process, formulation, redundancy, mood, prediction, and
interest. Although uncertainty is often discussed as though it is always a negative aspect
of information seeking, scholars such as T. D. Anderson (2006) contend that uncertainty

60

is more than a necessary evil. In fact, uncertainty may actually be a sign that an
information seeker is truly leaving his or her comfort zone in the course of the search.
According to these scholars, uncertainty may be an indicator that students are actually
making new knowledge and meanings from the information discovered in the course of
the search, rather than merely seeking out information that bolsters their preconceived
notions.
However, information seekers often choose to consult with other people for
assistance and support during the search process. Kuhlthau (2004) notes that students in
particular tend to consult both formal and informal mediators in the course of their
information searches. For that reason, she argues for an improved process for formal
mediation. Although numerous scholars have attempted to improve the theory, practice,
and promotion of the formal mediation services provided by academic libraries, some
students continue to prefer to consult informal mediators. In addition, some research
suggests that students find informal mediators more helpful than librarians in their search
process.
The problem of interest to this study could possibly be explained by examining
students’ mediation encounters through the lens of Critical Information Literacy.
Developed by Elmborg (2006) as an offshoot of Freire’s Critical Pedagogy, Critical
Information Literacy calls into question the privileged status of libraries and
librarianship. Theorists such as Swanson (2004, 2011) call for a problem-posing
information literacy pedagogy, and O’Connor (2006; 2009a; b; c) takes his critique one
step further, identifying an untenable theoretical tension between pluralism and
neoliberalism that lies at the heart of librarianship’s definition of information literacy.

61

Olson-Kopp and Kopp (2010) shift their focus from the librarian to the student, proposing
three key traits of critically conscious information seeking. Elmborg (2010) discusses the
ways that librarians can incorporate critical information literacy into their daily activities.
The Association of College and Research Libraries has responded to the changing
landscape of information technology and theory, and is drafting an information literacy
framework that appears to both bolster and undermine aspects of the critical information
literacy paradigm.
Building on both this thread of literature and the research problem of formal and
informal search mediation, it seemed possible that these three strands of theory, practice
and policy could be used as lenses on students’ experiences of mediation encounters,
lighting up issues related to theory, research, and practice of search mediation. By
understanding the events that take place and the benefits conferred by different mediation
encounters, it may become possible to begin to redefine the conceptual framework of
information literacy by gaining a greater comprehension of students’ experiences during
formal and informal mediation encounters.

CHAPTER III

METHODOLOGY
This discussion of the methods for this qualitative case study will open with the
general perspective of the research design as indicated by the research problem, purpose
and questions, as well as my epistemological worldview. I will then provide a brief
overview of the research context as well as criteria for the selection of participants. Given
that the key instrument in qualitative research is the researcher herself, I will briefly
discuss my role and positionality in the research process. The final sections of this
chapter will consist of descriptions of the procedures that I used to collect and analyze the
data for the study, as well as the way in which I used the Association of College and
Research Libraries' (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy in Academic Libraries
as a theoretical framework for my findings. The chapter will conclude with a brief
summary of the research methods.
General Perspective of Research
According to Creswell (2009), in addition to one’s audience, a researcher should
consider two key issues when selecting a quantitative, qualitative or mixed research
design. First, and most importantly, a researcher must consider the problem to be
explored, as well as the purpose of the research and the research questions. Second, a
researcher must consider his or her own worldview, its basic considerations, and how
those considerations influence his or her approach to the problem.

63

Statement of Research Problem
Kuhlthau (1993, 2004) defines information-seeking uncertainty as a cognitive
state commonly experienced in the early stages of the information search process due to a
lack of sufficient understanding of the phenomenon that the information seeker is
attempting to investigate. An information seeker’s unfocused thoughts can lead to
emotions of anxiety, confusion, and a lack of confidence. Kuhlthau and subsequent
scholars of uncertainty (Genuis, 2007; Brumfield, 2008; Adams, 2010; Chowdhury,
Gibb, and Landoni, 2011; Kamal and Burkell, 2011) contend that experiences of
uncertainty, which are particularly common to novice searchers, can often frustrate
further search activity. Kuhlthau (2004) argues that formal mediators such as librarians
are best equipped to teach students the skills needed to overcome uncertainty by
providing instruction in information literacy skills useful in navigating common
cognitive, affective, and procedural roadblocks.
However, Kuhlthau (2004) also noted that information seekers are far more likely
to consult with informal mediators, such as parents, friends, coworkers, and experts.
Scholars and librarians (Limberg & Sundin, 2006; McKenna, 2009; Shah & Kitzie, 2012)
have tried to address a situation they perceived as counterproductive for information
seekers by exploring ways to improve both information literacy curriculum and outreach.
Despite these efforts, researchers such as Tsai (2012) have observed that students not
only still prefer to consult people that are not considered formal mediators by Kuhlthau's
definition, they find these informal mediations more helpful than talking to librarians.
The “perplexing and enigmatic state” of affairs (Clark, D. L, Guba, & Smith,
1977, p. 7) described above suggests that current literature on the information search

64

process and information search mediation may not fully or accurately depict the aspects
of search mediation that are actually the most important to information seekers. Recently,
proponents of critical information literacy such as Elmborg (2006; 2010; 2012), building
on the foundational work of Freire (1970), critiqued instruction librarians’ emphasis on
information transfer at the expense of the development of critical information
consciousness, and the habits of mind needed to both find and critically engage with the
information they need. Upon juxtaposing the literatures of search mediation and critical
information literacy, it seemed that an in-depth study of students’ experiences of search
mediation encounters and their perceptions of the role of mediation encounters within the
information search process as a whole could shed light on this problem. A resolution to
this perceived problem could provide guidance for librarians seeking to better serve
students, and for theorists and researchers attempting to understand how search mediation
encounters help students navigate the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the information
search process.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study was to explore lower-division undergraduate students’
thoughts, feelings, and actions as they engaged in and reflected on their information
search mediation encounters over the course of a course-related information search
process.
Research Questions
Based on the research problem and purpose, this study explored two main research
questions.

65

1. What are the characteristics of information search mediation encounters as
experienced by lower-division undergraduate students?
2. How do students use search mediation encounters to navigate the information
search process?
Overview of the Study
As Creswell (2009) notes, a researcher’s research design choices should be based
on the questions under exploration, as well as the epistemological worldview and
experiences of the researcher, and the researcher’s sense of the needs of those who will
be reading the study. This section of the chapter will provide an overview of the
epistemology, research design, theoretical perspective, methodology, and strategy of
inquiry for the study.
Researcher Worldview
My personal epistemology (Hofer & Pintrich, 2004) is a version of pragmatic
constructionism influenced by both Dewey (1933) and Bourdieu (1977). I contend that
people come to understand concepts most effectively through experience, and that the
experience of coming to understand an experience of an issue can sometimes effect
change in the issue being examined as well as in the subject. In addition, different and
equally valid interpretations of reality may emerge depending on the perspective of and
theoretical lenses employed by viewers. For this reason, knowledge is often constructed
and codified through social processes and group consensus, based on how well it
describes or influences events in the outside world (J. A. Anderson, 1996).
Qualitative Research Design

66

According to constructionism, “meaning comes into existence in and out of our
engagement with the realities in our world” (Crotty 1998, p. 8). Different people can and
do give different meanings to the same external object, depending on their perspective,
culture, and viewpoint. Broadly speaking, constructionists hold that a concept can be best
understood by accepting all meanings ascribed to it as valid, and by capturing a variety of
different meanings that people have constructed around the object, it is possible to gain a
fuller understanding of those meanings singularly and collectively. By approaching the
research problem from a constructionist stance, it seems possible that by exploring
students' experiences of information search mediation, researchers and practitioners could
gain a clearer understanding both of the interactions themselves, and of the role those
interactions may play in successful navigation of the information search process.
Theoretical Perspective
Theoretical perspective is a philosophical stance that flows from the
epistemological viewpoint of the research questions and purpose of the study, and in turn
informs the methodology and method of the research (Crotty 1998, p. 3). Theoretical
perspective “provides a context for the process involved, and a basis for its logic and
criteria” (p. 66). This study is based in the epistemological notion that knowledge is
continually constructed in a historically positioned process of interaction between a
subject and the wider world. Therefore, the methodology and methods of research must
incorporate forms of inquiry that are designed to capture this meaning-making process.
This study was based in an interpretivist symbolic interactionist framework.
Interpretivism is rooted in the concept of verstehen, or understanding (Crotty, 1998).
Interpretivists argue that unlike the natural world, human and social structures cannot be
67

understood through a descriptive process of counting or measurement. Instead, the social
scientist must attempt to understand the viewpoint of people and groups by interpreting
the meanings of their actions and statements. Meaning is thus inductively derived from
researchers’ understandings and interpretations of the people around them, rather than
being deductively extrapolated from the researcher’s own previously-held beliefs and
opinions. Interpretivist researchers do not claim an ability to objectively assess an
externally existing reality. Instead interpretivists admit and clarify their positionality, as I
will do later in this chapter.
Symbolic Interactionism, an offshoot of pragmatist epistemology, is the
theoretical perspective that informs the study. George Herbert Mead, the social
psychologist and father of symbolic interaction, disagrees with earlier psychologists who
contended that individuals create cultures and social groups by joining together in a
common goal. Instead, “A person is a personality because he belongs to a community,
because he takes over the institutions of that community in his own conduct” (Mead,
1934, p. 162). In the case of the students whose search processes were explored in this
study, they were attempting to learn the processes and knowledge needed to become part
of the intellectual community of a Composition II classroom. Successfully acquiring the
writing and information-seeking skills taught in Composition II, and acquiring to other
unspoken norms taught in college, gains a student entry into higher level courses, and
eventually a diploma.
For Mead (1934), a person’s understanding of the world (and by extension
consciousness) is constructed through uses of symbols such as language, actions and
objects to interact with that broader community. Herbert Blumer, Mead’s student, took

68

his mentor’s thoughts a step further, refining them into the three key tenets of symbolic
interactionism:
1. That human beings act toward things on the basis of the meanings that
these things have for them;
2. That the meaning of these things is derived from, and arises out of, the
social interaction that one has with one’s fellows;
3. That these meanings are handled in, and modified through, an
interpretive process used by the person in dealing with the things he
encounters. (Blumer 1969, p. 2)
This study explored the ways in which students interact with search mediators
during the course of an information search undertaken for a Composition 2 research
project. More specifically, I explore how students use these mediation experiences to
make sense of information search process, and to potentially become more critically
conscious evaluators and synthesizers of information. Symbolic interactionism is
specifically concerned with an actor’s view of a situation, above all else. As Denzin
explains, “Methodologically, symbolic interactionism directs the investigator to take, to
the best of his ability, the standpoint of those studied” (1978, p. 99). By gathering thick,
rich descriptions of students’ experiences of information search encounters, and
discussing students’ impressions of the importance of these encounters within the context
of an information search, I engaged in dialogues with students that allowed me to
“become aware of the perceptions, feelings, and attitudes of others and interpret their
meanings and intent” (Crotty 1998, p. 75-6).

69

Methodology and Definition of Cases
This research study employed a multiple case study design as described by Stake
(2006). As Gay, Mills, and Airasian (2008) note, case study design is appropriate for
such an in-depth study of instances of phenomenon as experienced by individuals. A
multiple case study approach (Stake, 2006) is particularly appropriate for this study. It is
designed for situations where, as in this research, each student’s search process, which
would likely contain multiple incidents of information search mediation, could be
explored as a separate unit of examination. For the purposes of this study, I define a case
as a single student’s information search as defined by Kuhlthau’s (1991, 1993, 2004)
model. Each case includes all experiences that occurred between search initiation and
continues to completion of the required assignment, as well as implications that a student
believes those experiences had or will have for future information searches.
In Stake's (2006) discussion of multiple case study methods, he notes that the first
order of business after identifying the problem and questions to be explored is to identify
the "Quintain", or central issue of interest (p. 6) as well as a set of individual cases that
both share a common condition or contest, and also somehow depict, enact, or exemplify
the quintain. In this study, the quintain is the interaction known as information search
mediation, as seen within the context of students' information processes for a courserelated assignment. Each student's search process is considered an individual case within
this study of information search mediation.
Procedures and Methods
Over the course of the study, I attempted to gain a fuller understanding of
students’ lived experiences of information search mediation during what was many

70

students’ first in-depth college-level information search. This section will outline the
research methods used in this study. After beginning with a rationale for selecting a
community college as a site for a study of early undergraduate information seeking, I will
provide a brief description of Urban Community College. As was discussed in chapter 2,
newer undergraduates students are more likely to experience uncertainty and, therefore,
to consult both formal and informal mediators. For this reason, Composition II students
were particularly appropriate participants for this study. Finally, after a brief discussion
of my positionality as an academic librarian, I will describe the data collection and
analysis methods for the study, as well as my rationales for those methods.
Research Site
Although this study is designed to provide a picture of information search
mediation which could be extrapolated to lower-division undergraduates in other
contexts, these participants all attended the same institution. Therefore, the context of the
research site will color their experiences in particular ways. I conducted this study at
Urban Community College, a community college system in the southern United States.
UCC is a large, four-campus system with approximately 35,000 part-time and full-time
lower-division students (Urban Community College, 2014). Such a site seemed ideal for
a research study focused on the information search mediation encounters of lowerdivision undergraduate students. As is noted in a report sponsored by the American
Association of Community Colleges and the Lumina Foundation (Mullin, 2012),
community colleges are becoming an increasingly popular starting point for students
planning to complete a four-year degree. In fact, as discussed in Chapter 1, UCC is the

71

only school in the city where a student can complete lower division undergraduate
coursework.
In addition to its growing importance for college completion, the community
college environment possesses some unique characteristics which seem relevant to a
study exploring the social dimensions of information seeking. Karp, Hughes, and O'Gara
(2008) describe some of these traits in their examination of the relevance of Tinto's
(1975; 1987; 2006) model of college student persistence to the community college
setting. Prior to Karp, Hughes, and O'Gara's work, conventional wisdom held that social
integration was less important in community college persistence, due to the more
transient, non-residential nature of most community colleges and their students.
However, the authors found that integration into a social network was at least as
important for community college students as it was to other types of undergraduates.
Especially noteworthy given the topic of this dissertation, the authors found that
information networks, or interpersonal connections between students where institutional
and academic information was shared, appeared to be very important aspects of
successful community college integration (p. 8).
Building on the exploratory work of Karp, Hughes, and O'Gara (2008), Price and
Tovar (2014) performed a quantitative multiple regression analysis that appeared to
validate the tentative findings of the earlier exploratory study. Among other findings,
collaborative learning practices appeared to be a strong predictor of community college
student success. When the findings of these two studies are considered in the light of the
research problem, purpose, and questions, the community college context appears

72

particularly appropriate for exploring the collaborative and social aspects of information
seeking, such as information search mediation.
UCC is a diverse community college, with four campuses and outreach centers
located in urban, suburban and rural settings throughout the Urban metropolitan area and
its surroundings. UCC is also a feeder institution for several nearby colleges and
universities that offer upper division and graduate coursework. In other words, students’
educational experiences at UCC will have implications for student success not only at
UCC, but at the local transfer institutions popular with UCC students. After the
completion of the proposal and IRB process, I conducted this study in April and May of
2015.
Research Participants
Composition II students must have demonstrated basic competence in collegelevel writing in order to have passed Composition I. However, students in the course are
still relatively inexperienced information seekers at the college level and are therefore
likely to experience uncertainty in the information search process. Focusing on
Composition II students allowed me to get a close look at the early information search
experiences of emerging lower-division information seekers who are still growing into
the information seeking skills they will need to survive as undergraduates. For this
reason, this research focused on the information search experiences of eight
undergraduate students enrolled in three different sections of Composition II at UCC in
spring 2015. This number strikes a reasonable balance between incorporating a variety of
experiences and perspectives on information search mediation, while also generating a
manageable amount of data for analysis. Of the students who respond to emailed and in-

73

class calls for participation, a maximum variation sampling strategy (Creswell, 2007, p.
127) was used to select participants representing a wide variety of genders, ages, and
instructors. Participants were only selected for this study if they were taking Composition
II for the first or second time. Interviews focused on their lived information search
mediation encounters as well as their experiences while performing information seeking
for Composition II assignments. In addition, I performed participant observations of class
meetings and study sessions. The details of data collection and analysis will be discussed
below, after a brief discussion of my positionality as the research instrument for the
study.
Reflexivity Statement
As Patton (2004) notes, “Reflexivity has entered the qualitative [research]
lexicon as a way of emphasizing the importance of self-awareness, political/cultural
consciousness, and ownership of one’s perspective” (p. 64). Because qualitative analysis
is grounded in the notion of researcher as instrument, a brief reflective discussion of my
positionality provides a necessary insight into the choices and perspectives that may
influence data gathering and analysis.
I am an academic librarian at a regional public university in the state of
Oklahoma. As a librarian at an institution with a large number of nontraditional, firstgeneration, and otherwise at-risk learners, I have a personal and professional interest in
understanding the strategies students use to navigate the information-seeking process. I
also want to use my professional and academic skills to share techniques that will help
students achieve their college goals. My formal education and later independent study as
a new academic librarian was typical, with a theoretical grounding in Karl Popper,

74

Ranganathan, John and Melvil Dewey, Kuhlthau's information search process, Bloom's
Taxonomy and similar staples of pragmatic and progressive educational and information
theory. Although I have established relationships with librarians and faculty at UCC, I
have never worked there and did not select participants whom I know.
I found that my positionality, overall, was an asset for this study. Because I am a
scholar and practitioner of information literacy instruction, my perspective as a librarian
may have been an asset in following particular nuances in search mediation experiences
less organic to a non-librarian. I have a deep knowledge of both the theories and realities
surrounding information seeking. In addition, ten years of assisting students in reference
interactions has taught me many of the common road blocks of course-related
information seeking. I was able to understand the issues the participants were dealing
with, and communicate with them effectively in interviews to dig more deeply into the
nuances of the search mediation experiences.
That said, I recognize that my own passion about the role of information literacy
in student academic integration and success could influence my research choices. I was
conscious of ways that my perspective could affect the data shared by participants, as
well as my analysis of the data. I maintained a researcher reflection journal to make these
issues of positionality in data gathering and analysis as explicit as possible, and to limit
the potential for my opinions to drown out the voices of the students whose experiences I
will explore. My notes served as background information as I compiled and analyzed the
data on each case and considered what they collectively suggested about the quintain. By
journaling about my emotions and reactions throughout the data collection and analysis

75

process, I was better able to discern moments when I inadvertently imposed my meanings
onto participants’ lived experiences.
In addition, for clarity of reading and in the spirit of qualitative inquiry’s explicit
treatment of the voice of the researcher-as-narrator as another source of data worthy of
analysis and critique (Wolcott, 2009), I presented my actions and choices during case
reports in first person, though only when such researcher information is essential to
understanding students’ information search experiences more fully. As Wolcott argues,
“Recognizing the critical nature of the observer role and the influence of his or her
subjective assessments in qualitative work makes it all the more important to have
readers remain aware of that role, that presence” (p. 17).
Data Collection Procedures
Creswell’s (2007), Patton’s (2004) and Wolcott’s (2009) work on qualitative
research design influenced the selection and design of study procedures, as did Stake’s
(2006) text on multiple case study methods. All participants in this study were current
Composition II students at Urban Community College.
Recruitment and protection of participants. After Institutional Review Board
(IRB) approval, I consulted with interested faculty members, eventually gaining entry
into three sections of Composition II taught by two different instructors. My plan was to
observe class sessions, study sessions, and other meetings. The first time I observed each
class section, 1-2 meetings before students began work on their major research paper, I
introduced myself, described my project, and shared a request for participants (see
Appendix A). Of the students who expressed an interest, a maximum variation sampling
strategy (Creswell, 2007, p. 127) was used to select eight participants. Each participant's

76

search experiences, as both observed and described by the student in interviews,
consisted of a discrete case within the multiple case study.
Once selected, I gave each student an information sheet explaining the informed
consent process, and asked them to sign the form indicating their consent to participate in
the study. Each participant was assigned a pseudonym to be used in transcripts and
memos. Consent forms were maintained separately from the data, to protect
confidentiality. All identifying information was stored on an encrypted and passwordprotected portable hard drive at my home.
Classroom, library, and study group observations. I performed three
observations of each participant during class meetings and group study sessions, in order
to observe and document any search mediation encounters that took place. I drew on
Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw’s (1995) text on ethnographic methods to jot impressions
while in the field. These jottings were expanded into field notes (See appendix F for field
note template) immediately following each observation.
Interviews. As soon as could be scheduled after the assignment due date, each
student participated in a 30-45 minute open-ended, semi-structured interview discussing
his or her information search experience. I held the interviews at a site convenient to both
the student and myself, ideally a library study room or similar private space on campus.
After completing a brief demographic profile (See appendix C), I asked students to share
their experiences of consulting formal and informal mediators. They had the opportunity
to describe contexts or situations that might have influenced their information search
experiences. The study interview guide is provided in Appendix D.

77

Participant Drawings. After the interview, I allowed participants approximately
15 minutes to draw a picture depicting their experiences related to the informationseeking experience and the influences of different mediation encounters. Students were
asked to explain the drawings to me in their own words. Drawing instructions and other
parameters of this exercise are provided in Appendix E. This method, as discussed by
Kearney and Hyle (2004), typically causes participants to explore the emotional aspects
of their experiences more fluently, and also serves as a means to triangulate interview
data. Further, Mannay (2010) contends that visual data generated by participants can
challenge a researcher’s inadvertent tendencies to make assumptions about a familiar
population or research topic. In the case of this study, visual data were a particularly
potent tool to challenge my positionality as a librarian as well as any resulting tacit
assumptions about students’ information-seeking experiences by “making the familiar
strange”(p. 94). I found that these drawings, especially because they were completed
immediately after the interviews, led to deeper, more poignant conversations about the
emotional aspects and contexts of the 8 information searches explored in this study.
Course Syllabi, Finished papers, Work notes, and other Documents or
Artifacts. I acquired a copy of the course syllabus and assignment description from each
instructor whose class(es) I observed over the course of the study. In addition, I asked
students to provide copies of their finished papers, any research notes, and other
documents or artifacts they felt might be relevant to their information search experience. I
printed or scanned these documents at my own expense, and analyzed them for potential
relevance to the case report for that student.

78

Data Analysis Procedures
Following the informal, preliminary analytic work of journaling and
brainstorming that took place at the same time as my data collection, I transitioned to a
more focused and formalized data analysis. Despite knowing that the analytic process
would be influenced by the data collected over the course of this study, I approached the
analysis process with a basic road map. As suggested by Patton (2004, p. 440-2), I began
the data organization process by transcribing the audio recordings of participant
interviews, deleting or changing identifying information and replacing names with
pseudonyms. I also verified that all other data (such as observation field notes) were
complete and included necessary metadata, such as dates, times, pseudonyms of
participants observed, and locations of observations.
At the same time I collated and organized the data as a whole, I made multiple
print and digital copies of all anonymized data (including participant drawings). One
copy was stored on my home office computer and imported into NVIVO qualitative
analysis software. Print copies of data were generated as needed. A second digital copy
was stored on a portable flash drive in a locked cabinet in my home office along with a
clean copy of all data and the original participant drawings. A third set of digital and print
copies were securely stored at my workplace.
My researcher journal, class syllabi, assignment descriptions, and other data
relevant to multiple cases or the quintain as a whole were consulted as appropriate
throughout the creation of both the case reports and the cross-case analysis. I used these
general data to uncover additional nuances of the case-specific findings and cross-case
assertions that emerged during the analysis process. The journal was updated throughout

79

the analysis process, and served as a check against researcher positionality overwhelming
the meanings expressed by the participants and preserved the timeline of my evolving
thought processes during data collection and analysis.
Case Reports. After completion of this preliminary organizational work, I wrote
a case report for each of the participants’ information searches (i.e. cases), in random
order. In addition to an introduction to the sites and non-participant individuals (such as
faculty members and select search mediators) relevant to multiple cases within the study,
these case reports comprise chapter 4 of this dissertation. To create each case report, I
reviewed the student's interview transcript as well as the drawings generated by that
participant, observation field notes, relevant portions of my researcher journal, and any
other relevant documents and artifacts gathered during data collection.
At this early stage, preliminary findings for that case began to emerge from the
data, which were noted for further exploration during the drafting of the case report. In
addition, some pieces of data appeared to be more significant to the research questions
than others, and receive closer attention in the case report. Each case report consists of a
narrative description of the student's information search journey, followed by closer
analyses of particularly relevant mediation encounters or other data that is particularly
evocative of the case.
Cross-case analysis. During the cross-case analysis, I identified cross-case issues
relevant to the research questions, or "themes" (Stake 2006, loc. 1134), that emerged by
considering each of the cases as data points within a larger whole. I then developed six
assertions that addressed each of the themes that emerge from the analysis. The analysis
took the form of a case-quintain dialectic. My focus turned from case-specific details to

80

quintain-level concerns and back throughout the analysis process, with each perspective
serving as a check on the other. Stake (2006) provides three possible "tracks" (loc. 1222)
for cross-case analysis. Each procedure offers a slightly different emphasis on preserving
case-specific findings versus ease of determining a small number of straightforward
cross-case assertions. Given the nature of dissertation research, the purpose of the project,
and the relatively small number of cases and expected themes, I used Stake's cross-case
analysis track 1. This method best preserves the voices of participants and individuality
of case findings throughout the analysis process.
After taking a short break from analysis to reset my perspective from a case-level
to a quintain-level perspective, I made a preliminary list of potential themes indicated by
the research questions and any notes made during the case-level analyses. After reading
each case report, I summarized each case on a short worksheet (appendix G), and then
consider the summaries as a whole. At this point, unexpected themes that emerged
inductively were added to the master list, a priori themes were revised as needed. I rated
each case for possible relevance to each of the final list of themes (see appendix H for
worksheet). I rated each of the cases' findings in a similar manner (see appendix I).
After this deep focus on cases and findings, I shifted my focus to the themes,
narrowing down the list to the most useful cases and findings for constructing assertions
for each theme in turn. I particularly noted any atypical cases or findings that complicated
or contradicted other evidence relevant to the theme. I then drafted at least one tentative
assertion for each theme. These assertions accounted for atypical cases, and said
something important about the theme as well as information search mediation as a whole.
After taking another break, I reviewed all case-specific and cross-case analysis to ensure I

81

had not missed any potential assertions. I then revised, merged, and discarded assertions
as appropriate. Finally, I ranked the finalized assertions in order of relevance to the
quintain. Rather than attempting to capture all possible assertions regarding the quintain,
I selected the six most important and interesting assertions for an in-depth exploration
and critique.
Chapter 5 of the dissertation consists of a brief summary of my cross-case
analysis experience, followed by a detailed presentation of each assertion. This synthesis
consists of an explanation of each assertion, a summary of my rationale for arriving at the
assertion, a discussion of supporting and contradictory evidence, and a statement of any
new meanings of the quintain that emerged through the exploration of each assertion.
Throughout this drafting process, I continued to critique my thought processes, and
consider whether I needed to return to the quintain or case-level data to revive discarded
assertions or create additional ones. Chapter 5 will close with a discussion of the insights
provided into each research question by the assertions that emerged from the cross-case
analysis. After the cross-case analysis work of chapter 5 was completed, I took a step
back, and drafted several memos on each of the cross-case assertions and their possible
implications to theory, research, and practice.
Discussion of cross-case findings. I then wrote another set of memos examining
the cross-case assertions in the light of the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy,
the theoretical framework through which I discussed the findings of this study. As
discussed in Chapter 1, Stake (1995) argues persuasively for eschewing an a priori
theoretical framework in a case study design when research questions are directed toward
exploring and understanding a broader social sciences issue (p. 16-17). Instead of framing
82

the study within the parameters of an existing model, the ways that the issue influences
and is influenced by the case should serve as the starting point for design and analysis.
As discussed in Chapter 2, the Association of College and Research Libraries
adopted the Framework in early 2016. Designed to provide information literacy
practitioners and researchers with a theoretical foundation for understanding information
literacy, I realized that the Framework could serve as a particularly appropriate
framework through which to examine my findings. To my knowledge, this discussion of
my findings is one of the first attempts to use the ACRL Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education as a theoretical framework for scholarly inquiry as well as
instructional design. As discussed in more depth in chapter 2, this document has been
evolving since 2013, alongside my work on this dissertation. As a practicing information
literacy librarian, my dissertation work took place at the same time I was consuming
numerous presentations, articles, essays, listserv conversations and tweets about the
Framework and the debates surrounding it. I realized that by putting my findings in
conversation with the six "threshold concepts" included in the Framework, I might be
able to discover ways in which my participants gained mastery of threshold concepts via
search mediation encounters. On the other side of the coin, assertions about search
mediation described above might provide new perspectives on the Framework and the
debate that surrounded its development and publication.
Because this study is the first to my knowledge to use the ACRL Framework as a
theoretical framework, I could not fall back on previous practice to determine how I
would put it in conversation with my findings. In addition, the ACRL designed the
Framework to address a lack of a broader theoretical grounding for Information Literacy
83

Practice, as opposed to this study, which was focused more narrowly on exploring the
topic of information search mediation. In addition, unlike the ACRL Framework’s
grounding in Meyer and Land’s theory of Threshold Concepts, I approached my study
from the perspective of Symbolic Interactionism. Because of these differences in intent
and design, the six Threshold Concepts did not completely resonate with my six crosscase assertions. And yet, important aspects of both my findings and the ACRL
framework emerged from putting them in conversation with each other, and I saw that the
discussion would not be a simple matter of looking at my findings through the lens of the
Framework. The findings illuminated important implications of the Framework, and vice
versa. Because of the newness and controversy surrounding the development and content
of the Framework, I did not think I could ignore what my findings seemed to say about
the framework in my discussion.
After considering a few possible organizational structures, I decided to organize
the discussion by my findings, briefly describing each one, discussing it in the light of
relevant threshold concepts or the ACRL Framework in general and then examining what
that particular finding supported or contradicted about the Framework. Revised versions
of my memos became the heart of the discussion of the meaning of the findings and
assertions, as well as the study's implications for the future of information literacy
research and practice. I present this discussion in chapter 6, the final chapter of the
dissertation.
Trustworthiness and Quality of Results
According to Lincoln and Guba (1986), a qualitative study is only useful to the
extent that the findings, cross-case assertions and the researcher's analysis of them are

84

trustworthy. Trustworthiness allows a reader to rely on a researcher’s findings as
accurate, to understand if participants’ experiences may be relevant to the setting in
which they may work, and to replicate the same study in their own setting if they so
desire. Several qualitative methodologists provide criteria for determining
trustworthiness, including Lincoln and Guba, Stake (1995), and Patton (2001). Unlike
Stake’s tight focus on triangulation and Lincon and Guba’s design for naturalistic
qualitative research, Patton uses a three-pronged approach to evaluate the methods
involved in creating a credible study, important aspects of the researcher-as-instrument,
and the philosophical context in which the research takes place. In this section of the
chapter I will define each of Patton’s three criteria of qualitative research credibility, and
discuss the aspects of my study that make it a trustworthy exploration of information
search mediation.
Rigorous methods of data collection and analysis
Patton (2001) states that the first criterion of a credible qualitative study is a set of
rigorous methods for fieldwork and data analysis. In an attempt to understand
information search mediation experiences from as many different angles as possible, I
used a wide variety of data sources in order to triangulate both within and between cases,
as recommended by Stake (2006). to a multiple case study; triangulation within a case
and triangulation across all cases. To perform a within-case triangulation I used
interviews, drawings, and observations to understand a participant's experiences from
multiple angles. This seeming redundancy provided a firmer foundation on which I was
able to make assertions and extrapolate findings from a participant's lived experiences of
information search mediation. In the second, across-case triangulation, I considered the

85

cross-case assertions in the light of what is already known about information search
mediation, both in the literature and in the experience of librarians and scholars who are
particularly knowledgeable about information seeking and reference.
However, rigorous methods do not end with data collection. I used Stake’s (2006)
long-established methods for multiple case study analysis to identify each case’s core
findings, and to put those findings in conversation with each other. I also used
trustworthiness practices suggested by Lincoln and Guba (1986) to get an external view
on my data, including member checking, “thick description” (Erlandson et al., 1993), and
most notably peer debriefing. During my data analysis phase, I took advantage of both
formal conference presentations and more informal conversations with colleagues to
determine whether they agreed that my emerging findings were truly grounded in the
data. By combining tried and true methodologies with an outside perspective from other
professionals within academic librarianship and higher education, I constructed a
rigorous methodological framework for this study. However, according to Patton (2001)
rigorous methods are only the first step of creating a credible research study.
Researcher Credibility
The researcher is the instrument of analysis in qualitative research. For that
reason, my positionality, perspective, and qualifications are an important factor in
establishing the trustworthiness of this study. Patton (2001) contends that a researcher
should “report any personal and professional information that may have affected data
collection, analysis, or interpretation” (p. 566). As discussed in greater detail in the
reflexivity statement, I am an academic librarian with experience providing instruction
and reference services to lower-division undergraduate students very similar to those

86

whose experiences I explored in this study. I also completed two previous research
projects exploring the information seeking experiences of undergraduates, one of which
was published in the Journal of Information Literacy in 2014.
In addition, the researcher herself can affect the data and findings of her study
simply through her presence in the field. I was very concerned about this issue, Students’
different mediation choices with librarians versus other possible mediators inspired this
study. I thought deeply about how I would conduct myself in the fieldwork. As much as
possible, I wanted students to think of me as a student who happened to be a librarian,
rather than the reverse. I dressed casually during observations and interviews, wearing
jeans and tee shirts that made me fit in with the students. I held all interviews in campus
study lounges and other spaces at UCC that students were familiar with and used
regularly. With one exception when an instructor asked me to answer a student’s question
about citation formatting, I did not offer any reference assistance. I continued to pay
attention to my effects as an investigator as I transitioned into data analysis. In addition to
the aspects of the research design describe above, I also kept a researcher journal
throughout data collection and analysis. Every day I worked on the study, I logged my
successes, mistakes, breakthroughs, unanswered questions, and second-guessing about
preliminary findings. I added to the journal and referred to it over and over through the
analysis. I used this journal as yet another tool to ensure that the findings of my study
remained grounded in the lived experiences of information searches that were the cases in
this study.

87

Philosophical Belief in the Value of Qualitative Inquiry
Patton (2001) notes that qualitative research, although becoming more common,
still does not enjoy the same respectability as quantitative methods. Therefore, it is
important to provide a cogent argument about how qualitative research methods follow
logically from the research questions a researcher is exploring. Such a carefully
constructed rationale is not only important in creating rigorous methods, but also in
explaining to readers the value of qualitative inquiry as a means to better understand a
topic of interest. I started from first principles, by defining the research problem, purpose,
and questions. I then turned to matters of theory, selecting and describing an
epistemological stance and theoretical perspective that were well matched to the
questions asked in the study, and upon which I could construct an appropriate research
design. By showing all the steps of my design rationale for this study, I attempted to
provide a chain of logic that would be clear to all readers, whether or not they were
already familiar with qualitative research methods.
Summary of the Methodology
The previous chapter provided a description of the methods for a qualitative
multiple case study exploring students’ experiences of information search mediation
encounters in the context of a course-related information search. For the purpose of this
study, a case is defined as a student’s information search from initiation to conclusion.
The design flowed from the problem, purpose, and research questions of the study, as
well as my personal epistemological worldview of pragmatic constructionism. The
research was conducted with current Composition II students at a public community
college system. After providing a reflexivity statement on my positionality as researcher-

88

as-instrument, I discussed the informed consent process, interview and observation
protocols, and the anticipated methods of data analysis. The chapter concluded with an
overview of the steps taken to conduct an ethical study with trustworthy findings that
may be useful to both researchers and practitioners.

89

CHAPTER IV
FINDINGS, PART 1: CASE-LEVEL ANALYSIS

The purpose of this study was to explore lower-division undergraduate students’
thoughts, feelings, and actions as they engaged in and reflected on their information
search mediation encounters over the course of a course-related information search
process. My study was guided by two central questions:
1. What are the characteristics of information search mediation encounters as experienced
by lower-division undergraduate students?
2. How do students use search mediation encounters to navigate the information search
process?
To explore these questions, I employed a multiple case study methodology as
described by Stake (2006). Eight students participated in the study. Each student's
information search process was considered a case for the purposes of this study. Stake
describes a two-step process of analyzing individual cases in isolation for key findings,
before considering them as a set to identify cross-case assertions that describe the
"quintain", or essence of the topic under investigation. This chapter presents the first, or
case-level, analysis of this multiple case study of Composition II students' lived
experiences of information search mediation during an information search process.

90

During a three-week process of gathering contextual data including classroom and
campus observations of the three class sections included in this study, I recruited eight
students to take part in participant interviews about their information-seeking
experiences. The data for each student (or case) included interview transcripts,
participant drawings, course syllabi, finished papers, work notes, and other studentgenerated documents or artifacts. As previously noted in chapter 3, I used numerous
techniques to bolster the trustworthiness of my data, intra-case findings, and cross-case
assertions.
This chapter opens with a brief introduction to the locations, instructors,
assignments, key mediators, and participants in this study. Following this contextual
information, the rest of the chapter consists of eight case reports, as well as descriptions
of key incidents from classroom observations, that are relevant to participants'
experiences. Because of context-related differences in assignments and experiences in the
Composition II sections from which participants were recruited, the case reports and
observations are organized by class section.
Introduction to Contexts and Participants
Although each student will be introduced more fully in their case report, this
section serves as a brief introduction to each student included in the case study. I also
provide a reference chart [Table 1, p. 92] listing students' class sections and basic
information that the reader may find useful. I used a fill-in-the-blank form to gather
demographic information, and used each student's own words verbatim to describe the
participant's ethnicity and gender.

91

Central Campus (Section A-1)
A little less than an hour before my first observation of Mrs. A's Composition II
class (Section A-1), I walked into the Central campus of Urban Community College for
the first time as a researcher. The ground floor of the six-story building, located in
Downtown Riverbend looked as though it had been recently renovated. My eyes took a
moment to adjust to the dimly lit interior, and I turned left to traverse an open space with
dark-yet-warm floor coverings, light wood desks and standing height counters for various
campus services. The effect was comforting and welcoming, as I strolled past and
exchanged nods with campus staff working at the service desks.
I rode up to the elevator to the floor where "Mrs. A" taught and held office hours,
and was immediately taken aback by the smell of disinfectant that, when combined by the
slightly shabbier décor and industrial linoleum floors, made me feel as though I was in a
hospital, not a college campus. A quick glance at the office across from the elevators
cleared up my confusion, as I realized the nursing school had their phlebotomy classroom
on this floor as well. I walked down the hallways, noting the reading lab, math tutoring
lab, and classrooms. The walls were mostly beige, with a few blue and dark grey accent
walls to break up the monotony. Every twenty feet or so, a piece of student art hung on
the walls. I turned into another hallway, and found one side of the hall completely taken
up with a long row of sliding glass doors, identical to what one might see in a suburban
house. However, instead of leading to a backyard, each one enclosed a small faculty
office. Most instructors used blinds to block most of the door from passersby, and each
door was covered by official notices, art prints, and cartoons. I soon found Mrs. A's
office, and knocked tentatively on the door frame.

92

Mrs. A and Section A-1 research assignment. Mrs. A smiled, and waved me in.
A tall, slender woman with blonde hair and an open smile, she had a casual dress and
manner that instantly made me feel at home. Mrs. A’s office was small, but even through
her vertical blinds I could see it was decorated somewhat more elaborately than those of
her neighbors. As I sat down, I noticed that the walls were covered with black and white
posters of scenes from classic Hollywood films, and a floor lamp provided a warm light
to the room in lieu of the florescent lights that were turned off. She mentioned that
today's class section had shrunk somewhat in recent weeks as the final drop date
approached, but was still hopeful that her class and their unique research assignment
would help me with my project. There were 15 students still enrolled in the class.
However, because of the popularity of that particular campus, day, and time with high
school concurrent students, only ten students were old enough to qualify for participation.
I learned that each student would be asked to write a 6-8 page research paper on a true
crime that had taken place in the last 70 years. Students would be expected to present
basic information about the crime and to critique the role of the media in covering and
depicting the events and their aftermath.
Section A-1 case study participants. Two students from this section of 15
volunteered as interview participants for this study. “Kaliq” is a 33-year-old father of two
who reported a mixed Syrian-American and Irish-American heritage, and is going to
school full time while also working full time. His long-term goal is to complete his prerequisites at UCC, transfer to the nearby Land Grant State-Riverbend (a pseudonym), and
graduate with an MBA in international business. “Ana” is an 18-year-old Hispanic
woman, also both working and attending UCC full time while living at home. Her goal is

93

to transfer to Flyover Flagship University (a pseudonym) on the other side of the state,
enroll in the pre-dental program and eventually earn her DDS.
Tisdale Campus (Sections B-1 and B-2)
UCC's Tisdale Campus was located in an ethnically diverse working-class area of
Riverbend about five miles from the Central campus. About 30 minutes before class time,
I parked at the newer of the two main buildings at the Tisdale Campus, a round steel and
glass structure that appears to have been built in the last 10 years or less. I dashed from
my car through the pouring rain to a covered entryway and entered the building, shaking
the water from my hair. Mrs. B was not in her office, so I took a few minutes to circle the
space and get my bearings. Approximately two-thirds of the space is devoted to
classrooms and offices, with a large pie slice devoted to a commons area ("The Forum")
with floor-to-ceiling windows, study spaces, a computer lab, and both math and writing
tutors.
Mrs. B and Section B-1 & B-2 research assignments. I returned to the faculty
office hallway to find Mrs. B at her desk. Mrs. B responded to my email solicitation for
classroom access and invited me into two sections of her Composition II classes. Mrs. B
was about 5' 7", with short, wavy red hair, wearing slacks and a white turtleneck topped
with an aqua jacket. She wore a large gold brooch on one lapel. I sat on the red and gold
floral sofa half-covered with papers and other items, and discussed the plan of attack for
the day. She had a warm but firm demeanor that seemed to provide a calming
atmosphere, different but likely no less effective in creating a productive classroom space
than Mrs. A's youthful eagerness. Later in my observations I learned that Mrs. B had an

94

undergraduate degree in Library Science and did most of her own information literacy
instruction, but shifted gears to English for her master's work.
The first class of the day, which will be referred to as section B-1, is the only
Honors section included in this study, with 10 students enrolled and 8 in attendance
today. One student was concurrently enrolled and under 18, and therefore ineligible for
this study. The theme of the semester for Section B-1 was detective novels, and each
student would be giving a presentation summarizing their next assignment, a researchdriven report on a mystery author or authors and their works. The 22 students in her
standard section (B-2) were creating online annotated bibliographies, or
"webliographies", of books, articles, and reliable websites related to their career goals.
Section B-1 case study participants. Two students from this section of 10 volunteered
for this study. “Frank” is a 49-year-old African American, studying business
management but ultimately planning to pursue a career in substance abuse counseling.
“Danielle” is a white, 36-year-old woman nearing the completion of her Associate’s
degree in horticulture, with a plan to eventually own and operate her own cut flower
farm. She has worked in the horticulture industry for many years, and currently works 20
hours a week at a small flower farm.
Section B-2 case study participants. With 22 students, this section was almost
the size of the other two combined, and four students from the class volunteered to
participate in interviews for this study. At 51, "Gary" was the oldest participant in this
study by two years, attempting college for the first time after supporting his wife through
a graduate program. This white male hoped to move into the human services after a
career in manufacturing had left him with creaking joints and a goal to give back to the

95

next generation. "Becky" is a 32-year-old White and Chickasaw Indian female planning
to become a teacher. I was struck by her enthusiastic in-class presentation of her research
assignment, and the fact that I witnessed her assisting a fellow student with information
seeking while observing the class.
Eric, a 22-year-old white male, was about halfway through the coursework
needed to complete his degree at the UCC Tisdale campus. Although he planned to
transfer to the local campus of Flagship State University upon completion of his
associate's degree and had expressed an interest in music production, he still had not
decided on a major. The final participant from section B-2 was Hunter, a lanky and
artistic 19-year-old White/Native American aspiring psychologist.

Case Reports
With all this contextual information in mind, I entered the field. During my three
weeks of observations I met eight students who shared their experiences of seeking
information and consulting search mediators in one-on-one interviews. After orienting
the reader to each of the three very different Composition II class sections with a
vignette adapted from my field notes, I presented the case reports from the students in
that class. All but two of the case reports include that student’s drawing exercise. Kaliq’s
drawing is not presented as part of his case report but instead is presented in chapter 5,
because of its significance to one of the cross-case assertions. Danielle's drawing of her
home office was not particularly relevant to the themes of this study and is not presented.
Observing Class A-1 (Central Campus): Peer reviewing rough drafts
Mrs. A described the plan of attack for the peer review session. For this in-class
activity, each student would read and evaluate their partner’s draft paper, paying
particular attention to the use of sources, construction of arguments, and the general flow

97

of the paper. As the peer review started, most students turned to their tablemates,
exchanged papers, and started quietly reading.
Student 5 moved over to the left row to work with Student 9 (“Ana”). Student 2
(“Kaliq”) raised his hand and asked Mrs. A for instructions on citing a source discussed
in another source. Mrs. A suggested that he cite the source that he actually wanted to
discuss, if he had access to it. Kaliq had found that newspaper article, but was unsure
how to format the citation. Mrs. A asked me if I could help. I had decided before entering
the field that it would be less awkward to assist a student if asked than to decline due to
my "observer" role. I briefly described to him how I would handle citing the source.
By this point, the room had become quiet as the students read and annotated their
partners’ work. Mrs. A sat down next to me, saying “I always feel useless during this
part.” Eventually students begin discussing their work. Kaliq and Student 6 were having a
very animated conversation. Student 6 was sharing some particularly gory details about
the autopsy reports she’d read on her case, and was proposing her theory of “Whodunit”.
Continuing my circuit, I encountered student 5 and Ana, who were discussing the
former student’s lack of citations. Student 5 said, “I never put sources in my drafts. I lay
out the format of my paper, then put them in later.” He also complained about his
struggle to find balanced media coverage. Mrs. A then gave students a 5 minute warning
to wrap up. At this point I had returned to my seat, and Kaliq and Student 6 were still
talking. Student 6 appeared to have caught a few typos, and Kaliq was grateful, saying
“Editing is not my forte.” Student 6 then pointed out a few spots in Kaliq’s paper where
he could make his arguments clearer. At this point Mrs. A called the class to order.

98

Kaliq’s Information Search: "I am a Research Badass."
It had taken a couple of attempts to make this interview work with Kaliq’s busy
schedule, but the wait was worth it. Kaliq sat in front of me in jeans, t-shirt and shaved
head, his features and relatively fair complexion reflecting the Irish-American half of his
heritage more plainly than the Libyan half of his background indicated in his name. At
first glance he looked younger than his 33 years. However, the stories he told of his
information-seeking experiences indicated ingenuity, determination, and maturity.
Kaliq’s experiences revolved around three key issues: a strong drive to write something
"original," balancing a thorough information search with his very real time constraints,
and the quest for a high grade.
Although most students in the class picked recent tabloid crimes or local incidents
where resources would be easy to come by, Kaliq opted for a nearly 60-year-old murder
case set in a distant state. Most students would have quickly given up and switched gears.
However, Kaliq not only survived his topic choice, he completed an excellent research
project, becoming a self-described “research badass” along the way. I wondered how on
earth a novice information seeker had gotten access to the decades-old newspaper articles
and other primary sources that he used.
Finding 1: The Importance of Originality. Different students have different
goals for their information searches, and by extension for their mediation. Kaliq wanted
to write an original paper that added new ideas about a topic that hadn't been done many
times over. Unfortunately, Kaliq realized very early in his search that he was “in over
[his] head”. Fortunately, Kaliq started by getting extra help at the campus library.

99

“[The librarian] came to our class and talked to us…and I was here a lot, so it
made sense to stop in…He just kind of pointed me in the right direction…how to
use [UCC's newspaper] databases and key words and stuff…and then weeding out
[the results]. …He explained to me that they don't have as many [resources] as he
would like as far as files in their databases because of, you know, funding. But I
ended up being able to do plenty of research without any of them. …Everything
that was in their database was pretty new.”
Kaliq was able to combine a few applicable library resources with front page
scans from relevant newspapers found in Google’s newspaper archives. However, Kaliq
felt he needed more information to come up with an original twist on the topic, something
he repeatedly mentioned as a necessary element of a good paper.
Kaliq soon found several books discussing his topic, all of which contained
reference lists of newspaper articles from the period. Kaliq told me that he wanted to use
as many of these newspaper articles as possible in his paper because of the importance of
primary sources to the assignment. However, Kaliq quickly became frustrated in his
efforts, "because the newspapers were either stuff that never got archived online because
it's too old, or it's in individual private archives and I had to pay for stuff. So it was hard
to get access".
Finding 2: Balancing Quality and Time. Undaunted after hitting roadblocks
with the library and Google, Kaliq thought that journalists might have access to resources
that he couldn’t get through either the internet or the UCC library databases. He called
two nearby journalism schools to talk to some professors. In both cases he was connected
to a friendly member of faculty. Both professors agreed that he had pretty much

100

exhausted the possibilities of online information seeking. Instead, each suggested that he
contact the newspaper in the city where the crime took place, and attempt to get copies of
the relevant articles from the newspaper archives.
Kaliq appreciated that advice and thought it was excellent, but ended up not
taking it, instead making do with the articles he already had, combined with books on his
topic. He concluded, “I ended up kind of balancing time with the value of having those
articles in my paper…I sort of just weighed it against, can I write an effective paper
without having those articles in my hand? …But that was good advice.”
Finding 3: Completing an "exemplary" information search. Kaliq provided
me with a copy of a “reflection” assignment he completed on his information seeking and
writing process for the research paper. His drive to excel permeated every paragraph of
his reflection, which itself was a fervent argument for why his paper deserved an A.
Kaliq discussed the requirements for an "exemplary" research paper, one of which was
the requirement to "conduct thorough research". Kaliq notes that his topic's age meant
that it "inherently require[d] more digging" to identify and access needed sources.
Writing about his work in the third person, he describes his information search process as
"the product of long, caffeine-driven nights, adorned with sloppy shorthand notes and
hand drawn maps, reminding him of possible avenues of discovery." For Kaliq, both the
quality of sources found and his "seriously agonizing" and time-intensive informationseeking process were indications that he had completed an exemplary research paper.
However, Kaliq contends in his reflection that the writer of an exemplary research
paper must do more than organize and summarize information found in other sources. A
writer must use the facts of the subject as a foundation on which to build his own

101

opinions and conclusions. Throughout his reflection, he describes how he struck a
balance between these two forces throughout his information-seeking and writing
processes. This interweaving of his own ideas and the information he found echoes the
entwined nature of the threads of time, grades, and the desire to write something original
as well as exemplary.
Ana’s Information Search: "You're going to help me with this."
Ana, wearing jeans and a t-shirt from the university where she hoped to transfer,
sat in front of me with the determined air of a young woman with a strategy. Ana was
taking advantage of the free tuition offered by UCC to all local high school graduates
with a minimum GPA to knock out her core requirements on the cheap before
transferring. With 17 hours already under her belt from her first semester, Ana was
wrapping up her first year of college in Mrs. A's Composition II class. She mentioned
that had learned far more about mass murderers and true crime than she ever expected,
and found the course theme of true crime very engaging. Although Ana worked a fulltime job in addition to her full load at UCC, she seemed enthusiastic about taking some
time out of the last weeks of her semester to share her experiences with me.
Finding 1: "Yeah, Google—you're my best friend." Ana seemed very
impressed with the offerings at her campus's library, both in terms of the collection and
the support from librarians. Ana described her first in-class library instruction session in
glowing terms, saying that the librarian showed off resource guides, database searching
tips, and even a video featuring a memorable library mascot using various resources and
services. However, when asked what resources she used in seeking information for her
assignment on the "BTK" murders, she glanced around the empty Central Campus study

102

lounge, dropped her voice to little more than a mumble, and confessed, "Honestly,
Google. I should've used the library research tool. I should have, but [whispers] I didn't. I
did not. It was all Google."
Curious about both her response itself and the appearance of guilt in her voice and
body language, I asked her more about why she opted for Google for most of her
information seeking. "I did [use the library], just not for this [paper]. …I really don't
know why I didn't use it; I just shot over because Google's like the main one. I'm like,
’Yeah, Google, you're my best friend’." When Ana completed her drawing exercise (see
Figure 2), I noted that she had inserted Google at the center of her picture, between the
various people she had asked for advice or to proofread her assignment. She responded
that it had seemed appropriate, since Google had been the main resource she consulted in
her information seeking.

Figure 2: Ana's drawing
Finding 2: "I need a good grade on this." Ana, like her classmate Kaliq, was
very motivated to perform well at UCC in order to transfer to her dream institution to

103

finish her undergraduate and graduate programs. She also felt a great deal of anxiety
about whether her writing was good enough to succeed at the college level. For that
reason, she turned to several friends for assistance in identifying typos, finding sources
and ensuring her paper flowed logically. She said her selection of mediators had more to
do with convenience than perceived expertise, because she mostly just wanted another
pair of eyes evaluating her work. Ana remarked,
The other people that I had read it, they said it sounded fine, but I think
they were saying that because they didn't have the prompt, they didn't have
the rules that she'd sent for us to use in writing this paper. But it did make
me feel like, "Okay, my paper's not terrible. I'm not going to fail this."…It
was reassuring.
Ana mostly asked her professor and two friends for assistance with the BTK
paper. Ana had never written a paper that required a refutation section, and asked Mrs. A
for some advice on finding sources that disagreed with the argument she was trying to
make. One friend was studying with her at the library, working on her own paper, and
they began collaborating to help each other find sources. "She read my rough draft, and
so she researched [The BTK Killer]. She found a site that I hadn't even looked at which
showed some very gruesome photos which I actually incorporated some into my
PowerPoint." Finally, Ana asked her boyfriend for his thoughts.
I found this-- it was a really good sentence in The Wichita Eagle. It was an article,
and I was thinking, "Man, maybe this would sound like a better introduction than
what I have already." And so I was like, "Do you think this would sound better, or
this would sound better?" And he said it sounded fine the way that I had it written.

104

By that point, I was getting frustrated. I just wanted to be done with this, so I was
like, "Okay, that's good enough."
All in all, Ana said she found asking her friends for help with seeking and
synthesizing information both intellectually and emotionally useful. "It helps to reassure,
yeah, whether my paper was good or not. …and to see what someone else thought about
them, my case, besides just what I was thinking - different perspectives, yeah."
Observing Class B-1 (Tisdale Campus): an impromptu Q&A
I sat in the back of the classroom, about 30 minutes into my first observation of
Section B-1, listening to students present summaries of their research papers on a mystery
genre, author, or book. At the end of student presentations, Mrs. B suddenly turned to me,
mentioned that we had some time left before the solo work period because a few students
hadn't been ready to present. She then asked if I had any questions I wanted to ask the
class as a whole about their information seeking. This was nothing that we had planned or
discussed ahead of time, but I wasn't about to let an opportunity like that slip by. I started
our 15 minute free-form class discussion by asking:
Me: What projects have you worked on this semester that required you to look for
information?
Student 2 (“Frank”): Everything! (laughter from students)
Me: What are the ones that have been a really big pain?
Student 1: There was an assignment where we had to use two outside sources for
information, but in theory we could do it very easily without those outside
sources, so it was difficult to figure out what information to use and how to work
with it.

105

Me: What did you do to get started when you needed to find those outside
sources?
Frank: Well, if we're going by [Mrs. B's] requirements, then that would require
going to the UCC database. I'm opposed to the databases, because I find them
redundant, and very unhelpful. They haven't helped me in anything. … Even
when you condense your search down, I mean, it's not helpful. You know, even
doing the one on therapeutic gardening. I narrow down the search pretty concisely
and it gives me material that's, it's a lot of material I gotta weed though, and I
maybe, maybe glean out a paragraph, and then I've got to try to build on that
paragraph. But, it's just there's so many different searches and so many different
ways to get information. But, like, [Mrs. B] and even [another professor], he's not
like diametrically opposed to online sources, but for him as well as Mrs. B, they
just want, you know, scholarly sources. And maybe not going to PhD level but
even going into a Bachelors', you're going to have to use those sources. You can't
just go with the stuff that's on the open web.
At this point, Ms. B cut in, asking why students should pick library resources over
the open web. A chorus of voices responded "It's verified", and "it's reliable". She
responded, "Right".
Frank: Yeah, yeah, and you can find a lot of bibliographies, in the PDFs, to just
expand the search you know.
Ms. B: I don’t limit them to databases. I want them to use the open web too,
because I know they're going to use them in real life and I want them to be able to

106

evaluate them. So we spend time early in the semester learning how to evaluate
them.
Me: When you run into trouble, what to you tend to do? Is there someone you ask
for help?
Frank: Yeah, I just ask Mrs. B! (Laughter from group) For example, I've got a fact
sheet [for another class], and so I say "Professor, I've got a fact sheet that I need to
do, can you help?" And she said, “I've never done a fact sheet!” And I went to a
librarian here, and I was going to ask you in fact (points at me). I mean, it was
crazy, like no one knew about fact sheets.
…
Ms. B: I'm not faulting him, but an example would have been nice.
Frank: Exactly. Even in the class there were several students that were up in the
air? They were like do you want it like this, or this, or was it two columns or a
brochure, and that was like, to me I was like "OK, I wish it was just like comp",
you know, I could put it in MLA format I could pump this out, you know, and be
done with it. But with him it was, it was challenging. And it still remains to be a
challenge.
…
Me: You ("Danielle") mentioned during your presentation earlier that there was
someone outside that you asked for help finding stuff?
Danielle: Yeah, "Kevin", He's in the "Forum", in the computer lab, he's a
computer guy-Frank: Computer guru! (class laughs)

107

Danielle: Yes, and there are tutors there as well. They're free, and they're in the
morning and the evening. They're there any time and they can help you with your
papers, help you with research, and anything.
Ms. B: The tutors used to be in separate offices, and when this building opened,
they were all combined for convenience. I think students like it; it's easy to find
the tutor that you need.
Frank: I've been to all the other campuses except "Suburban", and I think this is
definitely the best Forum. I don't like "Creekville". The only good thing about
Creekville is their power points, they have color printers. Central's, Central's are
divided up so you have to go to different parts of the campus [to get help]. But
even there, I went to their writing lab and asked how to find something, and she
got on her phone (to start searching) and I was like. "I could have done that!" I've
got a smartphone; you know what I'm saying?
Frank’s Information Search: "It takes people helping people."
As may be apparent from the observation vignette, Frank is a gregarious and
insightful student. Although he started UCC in middle age, his large and tight-knit
extended family values education greatly. Frank's communal approach to the
information-seeking process, and academic life in general, gave him a unique take on the
subject of this study. Like the other participants of the study from the Tisdale campus, we
met at the Forum on a quiet weekday afternoon. The study lounge was so silent I could
hear the jazz music emanating softly from the headphones hanging around his neck as he
shared his personal theories about success in both information seeking and college in
general.

108

Finding 1: Information is "Boundless". Whether searching the library databases
or Amazon.com book summaries, Frank was willing and able to search far and wide to
find as much information as possible. He even enjoyed the inevitable dead ends and side
tracks of the information search process, considering anything he learned a useful piece
in his ultimate goal of becoming "educated". When I asked Frank what he had learned
about information seeking over the course of the semester, he responded,
It's just boundless. It's boundless. I'm like, you know, "Today, no one has a reason
to be ignorant," even if it's just seemingly useless information…even if it's just an
interesting factoid or whatever it is. …But it's not [useless information], because
it could be useful one day. That's the thing about it.
However, Frank was quick to note that the "boundless" nature of information
seeking, as he experienced it, also had a "dark side". Fortunately a friend at the library,
Frank’s history instructor, and even Mrs. B helped him learn some search strategies to
navigate the information landscape without being overwhelmed. In addition, Frank, who
formerly prided himself on being a free-form, intuitive writer in his assignments and his
personal blog on success, had embraced the power of outlining to keep his search process
manageable. As he put it, "Because at the same time, where it is boundless, it's so much
out there that you have to narrow it down." This tension was born out in Frank's drawing
(see Figure 3), with arrows of information flying back and forth via the computer,
insights arriving in the middle of the night, and a student handing an assignment to an
instructor who, according to Frank, was unsure of and possibly puzzled about what he
had just received.

109

Figure 3: Frank's drawing
Reading Antigone at the family reunion. As Frank talked, I soon realized it
would be impossible to understand his journey as a solitary one, even by the standards of
a study exploring the social aspects of the information search process. Frank described to
me a world filled with family and friends, mentors and protégés, and a free-flowing
exchange of information and guidance that permeated and powered his entire social web.
Frank stated he regularly asked for help from professors, librarians, and tutors, but most
of all from educated friends and family.
I don't know how some people can go through their education career and not
receive help from their peers. …Your peers, you can text, you can call, you can
go sit down somewhere in Starbucks, kind of brainstorm. You can do all these
different other things and it brings more of a sense of community. …That's what
I'm big on, and this is just how I was raised and my family."
Frank continued, saying,
[Peers] are my sources sometimes, even more so or in addition to, you know,
search engines, databases, and whatnot. …Research is about not only finding your
110

information, not only finding your sources, not only finding people who hold the
same view or maybe even a counter view. …They're not the final authority or The
Authority, but yet they're going to be honest.
Frank shared several examples of giving and receiving information search help
with classmates and friends who were ahead of him at UCC or had completed their
degrees. However, the most notable example of all took place at a family reunion a few
semesters before our meeting, when he was taking a humanities course and struggling to
write his first college paper ever, on Antigone.
You want to talk about sources. Who was my source on that one? YouTube. I
watched the play. …You know what? I loved that book. I love it. It was really-- it
was good. So I'm on family vacation, watching Antigone on YouTube. It was
crazy. …I'm asking people, "What do you know about Antigone?" "Who?!?!"
[laughter] Oh, my God. It was crazy. …And my niece who got her--she got her
doctor's from Ole Miss. She was up there, and I'm like, "Surely, she would know."
She has a doctorate! So I'm like, "You had to write a dissertation. Come on, man.
Help me. Give me a bone here." …She said, "You're a writer. You can do this.
You can do this." And I ended up making an A on the paper.
Danielle’s Information Search: "It’s just a matter of expanding your mind."
Unlike most of the students I interviewed, Danielle had completed 49 credit
hours, and hoped to graduate next semester, assuming she could get all the courses she
needed to finish. Possibly because of that experience, Danielle struck a noticeably
reflective tone in our conversation, often commenting on how the things she learned fit in
the larger scheme of her college experiences.

111

Finding 1: Mediation as a shortcut to identifying “real” sources. Danielle was
very concerned about finding reliable sources for her work, and returned to this topic
throughout our conversation. Early on, she stated that she almost always started her
research work at the library website, and other sources recommended by her instructor,
Mrs. B.
UCC has a website that you can go into off of Blackboard… it's through the
library, it's like their [Google] Scholar. It's all just articles and papers that have
been examined and are not--they're real. …Then just in Comp I, Professor B kind
of taught us how to go through websites and tell whether or not they were true, or
if they were just trying to get money and things like that.
Ms. B, who was an English instructor but who also has a degree in librarianship,
came up often as a search mediator when I talked to her students from class sections B-1
and B-2. I asked Danielle to share a bit more detail on what Ms. B had taught her and
how it helped in her information seeking.
She helps you figure out which sources are reliable and then you just kind of go
from there. … She gave us a list of sources and so we went to them and you can
tell which ones weren't [reliable]. But you really just had to decipher and go
through them... And definitely, if they have a lot of ads and request money things like that - they're probably not that reliable.
Later in the interview, Danielle mentioned that she regularly looked up nonacademic information on the web for her “computer-illiterate” husband.
He needed to know how to change out the igniter in our oven. And so I Googled
that, found the part. …Finally found [a parts website] that I thought was

112

reputable, ordered the part, he got it in. I pulled up YouTube tutorials… To see
other people doing things that--well, tutorials, like anything, make-up tutorials, I
love it. …A tutorial is a real person giving a real demonstration about a product or
something that they've done in life... It’s real commercials, not like TV."
Finding 2: Information seeking requires flexibility. Danielle seemed to
consider flexibility an integral skill for surviving the information search process, both
when seeking information and when integrating it into a final project. When describing
her approach to searching a database, she commented,
If you're just thinking, "I need to find out more about Agatha Christie's The
Murder of Roger Ackroyd." But if you type in -- if you put it in different verbiage,
maybe don't put in the title -- and type in the years that she wrote, you might get
other people who wrote entire books about her or might get other information that
you didn't know existed. You just have to kind of play around with everything.
More intriguingly, Danielle understood that while the planned topic of an
assignment was the starting point of a search, she often changed her plans in response to
the information she uncovered in a search.
You can change your thesis to match your story [chuckles]. You don't have to
keep to the same thesis…if your story changes midway through, you can change
thesis and topic sentences, you're not stuck. … I was always like, "Okay, this is
what I need to find out. …those are the only things I can read." But that's not true.
It’s just a matter of expanding your mind.
Finding 3: Information mediator or information source? Danielle’s main
research assignment for her Composition II class was to present viewpoints on the merits

113

of reading detective novels. However, two days before the deadline, she still couldn’t find
very many sources. At this point, Danielle decided to use an unorthodox source—friends
and family who liked to read mystery novels. She sent loved ones a brief questionnaire,
and they returned it with their responses, which she incorporated into her presentation. I
was intrigued that Danielle was approaching friends not as information mediators but as
information sources, and asked how her friends influenced her information search and the
assignment she created.
After mentioning how she would have changed her approach if she had had more
time, Danielle commented,
I should have asked a certain set of questions, and then come back with another
set of questions. Instead of sticking to the same set per person, because each
person was different in their answers. And same with my friend ("Amy"), she
surprised me when she told me that science fiction was really what her interest
was. I mean that just was shocking to me.
Danielle’s friends, serving as both sources and mediators, surprised and
challenged her assumptions in various ways. Having embraced flexibility as a key part of
her process as a student and information seeker, Danielle was able to listen to what they
said and go where the information led her, even though she might have made different
decisions if given more time. Finally, Danielle said she used her encounters with
mediators to learn the best and most “true” sources relating to the topic at hand, and
listened to what they had to say as she created an innovative and engaging presentation
for her class research project.

114

Observing class B-2 (Tisdale Campus): A classroom presentation
Much like the presentations in Section B-1, the students in Section B-2 each had
to present summaries of the information they had found for their Webliography (online
annotated bibliography) assignments. Student 1 was a woman appearing to be in her mid30s, whose straight, honey brown hair touched the shoulders of her navy tee. She had a
particular interest in researching gallstones, due to having her gallbladder removed a few
years before. She dedicated her presentation to Mrs. B saying, "She didn't make us do a
10-page research paper, she made it easier." I watched this presentation particularly
intently, as I thought the presentation and discussion might have particular relevance for
my topic. She used a variety of resources, including websites such as the Mayo Clinic
and WebMD, a few articles from Academic Search Premier, and an "excellent eBook" on
chronic diseases. She then asked if anyone in the classroom had personal experience with
gallstones, and a soft-spoken blonde who appeared to be no more than 18 or 19 (Student
3) raised her hand. The student presenter proceeded to ask Student 3 various questions,
including what type of gallstone she had (Cholesterol stones vs. Pigment stones). As her
presentation drew to a close with some tips on gallstone symptoms, the Q&A session
evolved into an interesting information-sharing session between the presenter, Student 3,
and several other students who had a family history with gallstones, or who had questions
about nursing. Student 1 described a variety of treatment options for gallstones, and
concluded her presentation to general applause.
Gary’s Information Search: Don't "put the house before the logs."
Gary, who had to take several semesters of remedial courses before starting credit
work, described himself as initially unprepared for college. He struggled a great deal in

115

his first semesters at UCC, but 40 hours into his associate's degree, he was starting to
gain little confidence in his academic abilities. His slight anxiety that had dissipated
during the interview seemed to return during the drawing exercise. Rather than reveling
in the artistic experience like some of his classmates, Gary quickly and anxiously drew a
series of word bubbles, connected them with lines, and handed the sheet of paper back to
me (see Figure 4).

Figure 4: Gary's drawing
Finding 1: "What word do I need to ask the stupid computer?" I was a little
dismayed that Gary misunderstood the verbal and written directions to the drawing
exercise, and that he opted not to take another crack at it when I invited him to do so.
However, in some sense his drawing was perfectly appropriate. Words, and his struggle
to find the right ones with which to search for information and construct his ideas, were
central to Gary's information-seeking experience.
Gary initially struggled to figure out how to even frame his search queries in the
library databases he used for his webliography assignment. Gary first turned to a librarian

116

at the campus library who "gave [him] some good words" to try, and then to his wife,
whom he asked for help regularly in part because of her advanced degree. "I said, 'Here,
what word do I need to ask the stupid computer?'…And then she'll say, 'Well, [computers
are] as smart as the person that's—[using them]'… 'I didn't need that, honey. [Laughter]".
However, as he wrestled with his webliography assignment exploring careers in
substance abuse counseling, Gary started making more sense of his topic through the
information he found, and in turn, began to feel more confident about his skills as an
information seeker.
Finding 2: "I'm headed in the right direction." Gary entered UCC very
uncertain about his abilities, and had to make up a lot of ground very quickly. However,
by the time he reached Composition II, Gary was beginning to believe he had what it
took to get through college, and he learned much more about information seeking while
constructing his webliography. Although he had a great deal of experience with addiction
and recovery issues personally and through his volunteer work, he was less skilled at
finding appropriate information in the scholarly literature.
Upon starting the webliography, Gary almost immediately decided to consult a
librarian. I asked him why, and he responded,
When I first started here, he was in a different position back then than he is now.
He can't give me quite as much of a help now. But he looked over some of my
papers… and gave me some pointers on which way to go.
Gary had established a working relationship with this librarian very early in his
time at UCC, and they had grown to know and trust each other. For that reason, it only

117

seemed natural to consult him when he had to take his research skills to the next level,
despite the fact that the actual ability of the librarian to help had diminished.
However, Gary described benefits from his mediation experiences that seemed to
transcend the mechanics of search terms and limiters, and the APA citation format.
I guess if anything, it's the assurance that I'm headed in the right direction. Not
sure about anything with college, prior to getting involved with this. Having
somebody say, "You're headed in the right direction," is gravy because when you
have…negative feedback all your life and then you find something that can get
[you] the positive [feedback].
Finding 3: "You've got to get in there and swim." Gary said that he depended
a great deal on tutors, his friend at the library, and his wife to survive his first few classes.
For my abilities to improve to where I was going to be able to finish even an
associate's I had to be willing to step out and ask for help. …you come into this
world alone and you leave this world alone, but God didn't make it to where
you're supposed to be alone while you're going through [laughter] the process.
That said, Gary didn’t want to depend on his friends and mentors for every detail
of his academic work. As he put it after describing an experience where Ms. B. assured
him that he had what it took to complete a task without her help, "You've got to get in
there and swim". He had taken more initiative with this semester's work, only consulting
his librarian friend for help with search terms, and not giving up when he didn’t
immediately find what he was looking for. As he put it,
I have to be careful to…go through the entire process. Because I can be looking
for one thing and come up with something else. But I have to step back and say,

118

"Okay, that didn't work. Now, where were you trying to get that computer to go
when it went over here?" And not to get myself too dad-gum frustrated to just
give up. …when I step back away for 30 minutes or whatever it is, it's not that I
quit. I'm regrouping.
Perhaps the most significant proof of Gary's growth this semester was that his
classmates were starting to ask him for help and advice instead of the other way around.
As he dramatically described his mental reaction to those requests, " 'You want me to
help you?' …I've had people say, 'I've seen you catch on with this, can you give me a
pointer in school work too?' And that makes you feel pretty cool."
Becky’s Information Search: "I just get right on there and go now."
Becky decided to research her planned career of elementary education in her
webliography assignment. One of two students I actively recruited for the study based on
in-class observations, Becky eagerly agreed to take part. We sat at a table in a quiet
corner of the Forum to talk about her experiences searching for information, and the help
she sought out and gave to others along the way. During our time together, two findings
emerged about Becky's experiences with search mediation, and the influences those
encounters seemed to have on her information search process as a whole.
Finding 1: Computer inexperience complicates information seeking. Whether
facing an obvious problem like creating a search query, or seemingly tangential issues
like creating and correctly formatting documents in Word, Becky most often sought out
help because of her inexperience with computers. Becky had never used a computer in
her personal or professional life before going to UCC, and despite having completed two
English Composition classes, had not yet taken the computer skills class required by the

119

college. As she ruefully noted, "I didn't know how to send an email or anything. It was
really bad. I was in bad shape."
Using the library databases was a particularly difficult challenge, and Becky had
to ask for help multiple times before she could even learn to navigate to the database she
needed.
He showed me the first time, and probably the first ten times, and now I can do it.
Just click on library, and then you go to articles, and then you go by subject, and
after you press that, it'll be something that says Academic Search Premier, and
you click on that and it'll take you there.
Of course, once Becky managed to navigate to the database she wanted to use, she
still had to figure out what she needed. Never having done anything more complex than a
basic Google search, Becky turned to librarians, both by drawing from the basic
information she had learned in a library instruction session, and later, by visiting one face
to face.
He's the one who showed me that I could download short e-books and articles and
stuff actually on my flash drive, instead of printing them all out like I'd been
doing. Then I can…work from home. …that guy over there was really
informative. He was a good help.
Fortunately, both her friend at the library and Mrs. B taught her some basic
searching skills that she felt would serve her well going forward.
Even professors have to sit there and play around with it. …I've learned to think
outside the box. 'Well, this happened in this year, maybe I should put this year in
or this person was involved in that time, maybe if I put this person's name in'…

120

You're not going to mess anything up. Just get on there and open some stuff you
don't need, and fool around until you figure it out.
Finding 2: Becoming an independent information seeker. Near the start of our
conversation, I asked Becky if she asked anyone for help while seeking information for
her Webliography. She replied that she hadn't. However, as I began asking more
questions, it became clear that she had asked numerous people for help with aspects of
her information seeking, including Mrs. B, a librarian, the writing center tutors, and most
often "Kevin", the IT help desk employee mentioned in Section B-1's discussion and by
several other Tisdale Campus students.
Becky described a typical mediation encounter with Kevin, in which he helped
with document formatting, citation styles, and successfully searching within a library
database.
I used to…ask him to set up my MLA format, and now I'm actually getting pretty
good at that just by practice. And this webliography kind of made me real familiar
with [using the databases], because when I was doing it for my history class I was
like, 'Oh, I can do this now.' Slowly but surely, one thing at a time, I could do
without having to get up and get him [chuckles].
Becky's emphasis on becoming a more independent information seeker emerged
throughout her stories of mediation. When summing up her mediation experiences, she
noted that
I feel a lot more confident. I could do it on my own if I had to; I do do it on my
own now. …I can just get on there and scan through it. I've been showing other
people how to do it now.

121

Becky went on to describe her experience helping a classmate find and cite
information with no small amount of pride in her voice.
She asked for help on her webliography, and I was just showing her how to do it
[on Easybib] real quick. It's another little website that'll help you cite stuff... You
can actually go in there and just put in the subject, and it'll give you websites to
choose from that are already cited [in MLA format].
Toward the end of our conversation, I asked Becky what she learned that would
serve her during her information searches down the road. She replied,
I probably won't have to ask anybody for help next time, which is a big, big, big
thing. …[Kevin] might be gone to lunch or one of them might be gone, and you
don't want to want to sit here for an hour or maybe even have to go home and
delay it for a whole day, and come back the next day... Setting up Word, getting
onto Academic Search Premier, getting your sources. If you can't do any of that
you're just stuck until someone can help you.

Figure 5: Becky's drawing
The themes embodied in Becky's drawing (see Figure 5) also reflect her deliberate
use of mediation encounters to become a competent and independent information seeker.
When asked to describe her drawing, Becky said,
122

These are all question marks and the light bulb represents like an epiphany, like
discovering something, learning something. This building is a UCC library which
is filled with lots of information and people that can help you. The main source of
everything is the computer. I put the picture of the world in there because
anything you need in the world or even in the atmosphere you can find in the
computer. …The computer's the most important thing. The internet just really
opens so many doors. …You could be sitting at home and have an argument with
somebody over which is right and which is wrong. You're just like, "Well, let me
Google it real quick. We'll just answer this right now." That's really good.
Eric’s Information Search: "I always try to make sure it's right."
Eric's presentation for his webliography, in which he used an "Epic Rap Battles of
History" video featuring Mozart and Skillrex in his discussion of his planned career as a
music producer, suggested he had a flair for creativity and music. Eric, wearing jeans and
a black button-down shirt, was somewhat soft spoken in his interview, and rarely chose to
elaborate at length on responses even when prompted. However, three intriguing findings
emerged from our conversation.
Finding 1: "I always try to make sure it's right." Eric stated he consulted
search mediators early and often. He focused on school-affiliated mediators (though "not
librarians"), stating he only wanted to consult "the best" people to make sure he was
selecting the right kinds of sources and using them in the proper way for his assignments.
Ms. B, who holds a degree in librarianship as well as a PhD in English, was a regular
source when Eric was unsure whether a particular source was appropriate. The writing

123

tutors, although not teaching him to search for information per se, helped him as he
integrated and synthesized his information and attempted to write it up in a clear way.
As our conversation progressed, I asked Eric if he had assisted others with their
information seeking. He brought up his changed approach to social media, due to a
clearer understanding of plagiarism and evaluating information. Eric said,
I check my sources [on Facebook]. …Also, things I post, I usually know a lot
about. So…I know to give that person credit. A lot of people you'll see put a song
lyric and it’s like, "You didn't just make that up. Who wrote it?" I try to give
credit to the authors and stuff like that now.
Finding 2: "That's really perfect for what I wanted to say." Eric began his
assignment with a clear idea about working in the music production industry. He was
interested in exploring
the fun side of music--why somebody would want to do it, other than the boring
side of why they wouldn't [laughter]. So I just looked for…an author or an article
on Google Scholar about something creative or how they would go about lyrics or
playing an instrument in creative ways, and that's what I tried to look at.
Eric used both in-class instruction on information seeking and a worksheet
provided by Mrs. B to design his information search strategy, which was largely selfdirected. Several times in discussing his search strategy, he discussed how he would go
about searching for information that backed up his thesis. Eric elaborated,
Google Scholar was my best friend. I would just Google a couple of words that
might hit the target of what I was looking for and just read through articles, and

124

maybe pieces of a book and just kind of see which best described what I was
trying to say.
As our conversation continued, I asked him about the choice of the Epic Rap
Battle video in his presentation, and he enthused at length, saying,
I've always done a lot of YouTube, so I just know the videos and I watch a lot of
those Epic Rap Battles. …I remember seeing that one and I'm like, "This would
be perfect for exactly what I'm wanting to say'.
When I asked him to elaborate what he meant by the video being "perfect"
information for his assignment, Eric replied, "[It was something I] kind of agreed with.
I've really wanted to show more than just the topic of music producing, the fun of music
and the creativity. … I just wanted people to enjoy [my presentation]".

Figure 6: Eric's drawing
Finding 3: Managing time and "Wiping out". Eric's whimsical approach could
also be seen in his drawing of his information search process (see Figure 6), which
included Sonic the Hedgehog and a skateboarder falling while attempting to ride down a
flight of stairs. When I asked him to explain his picture, he said, "You've got to find
[information] fast, and right away. That's how it is…And that was somebody wiping out.
125

So sometimes you can wipe out. … [When you wipe out] you got to try again. Get back
up and keep trying, keep searching."
Hunter’s Information Search: A tale of Three Images
Hunter's stringy, chin-length brown hair curtained his face as he hunched over an
11x17 sheet of blank paper, sketching intensely. I had asked Hunter to take 10 to 15
minutes to draw a picture describing his experience seeking information for his
webliography about the 2014 Ebola outbreak. However, given Hunter's description of
himself as an artist, and the obvious effort he was putting into his sketch, I opted to hang
back for as long as he kept working. After about 20 minutes, he sat up, brushed his hair
out of his eyes, and gave me a tentative smile.
I soon learned that Hunter had actually only created one of three possible
drawings that had crossed his mind. After he declined my offer of more time to sketch
those drawings, I asked him to describe the two drawings he had not created as well as
the one he had. Hunter proceeded to describe a series of visual metaphors that he used to
make sense of his information-seeking journey and the mediators he met along the way.
Figure 7 in this section is Hunter's actual drawing, and the second two are images that
Hunter described as inspiration for the other two parts of his imagined “triptych".
Hunter’s imagery blends high art and pop culture, and when taken as a whole depict the
way in which this artistic information seeker made sense of his mediation encounters.

126

Figure 7: Hunter's Drawing
Finding 1: an image of self-reliance. Several times during our conversation,
Hunter had expressed the difficulty he had asking help, and initially stated he had done it
all on his own. However, as his interview progressed he mentioned that he had consulted
an older online friend, his mother, and a psychology professor, "Dr. T", whom he
admired very deeply. Intriguingly, Hunter volunteers in the 3D-printing lab at the local
public library, but never mentioned asking his librarian supervisor for help with his
information seeking. Hunter explained that the drawing he completed, shown in Figure 7,
described a series of mediation experiences with his friend from "Second Life", whom
Hunter considered to be a skilled writer, researcher and proofreader.
This represents, sort of like the communication block I go through with my friend,
reviewing it to somebody online. Although it is a big help, a lot of the time she's
like "What are you trying to say with this?" And I'm like "I don’t know." …This
is me crinkling my essay— Just like super furious about it, "I gotta get this done, I
need to get three hours of sleep tonight!" [laughter]… I'm really reaching out
because I'm the kind of guy that doesn't ask for help unless he really needs it. …If
127

I can't do this, then something's seriously wrong and I need to change something.
So I'm going to ask somebody and say, "I don't know what to do!"

educational purposes as defined by the fair use provision of United States Code, title 17,
section 107.
Finding 2: Approaching the Guru. Hunter then described his planned second
part of his triptych, a "silly" one where he was "climbing up a really big staircase to this
Tibetan temple to ask a wise man for advice… Just sitting there with a big Fu Manchu
down to the floor, he's like, 'Can I help you?' " When I commented that it sounded like
something out of Kill Bill, he grinned in approval at my recognition of the reference and
nodded, saying, "I'm a big movie watcher so a lot of my [art] is pertaining to, you know,
referencing something."
Upon reflection, I realized that Hunter's imagery of an Asian guru might relate to
his Psychology Professor, a particularly influential search mediator whom Hunter
consulted often. At several times in our interview, Hunter spoke in deeply flattering and
slightly worshipful terms of how much he's learned about writing and information
seeking from "Dr. T", a psychology professor who had taught Hunter a great deal about
128

information seeking, not all of which might be considered orthodox by more traditional
faculty or instruction librarians.
Always use Wikipedia, but never list it [chuckles] . . . I've even been told this by
the great "Dr. T" [chuckles]. He said, "The first thing you want to do when
writing a paper with a certain topic--whatever topic you choose-- the first thing
you should always do is look up a Wikipedia on it." Then he said, secondly,
"Never cite the Wikipedia. Only get the information from it." And third, he said,
"Don't tell anybody I told you that [chuckles]."

educational purposes as defined by the fair use provision of United States Code, title 17,
section 107.
Finding 3: The Persistence of Assignment Deadlines. Once again, Hunter
turned to an existing artwork (see Figure 9) to discuss his third image of his informationseeking experience, though one rather more highbrow than Quentin Tarantino's:
I was just thinking about, like the frustration of writing a paper without, of course,
procrastinating and then doing it in a timely fashion. And then what I always do,
129

just can't help, it's finishing it on the night before. … I was thinking of doing a
representation of Dali where there was a clock hanging and I was just out in a
field, like picnic basket next to me, and then the essay in front. And the clock is
drooping down and I'm looking at it with a worried expression on my face. And
I'm hunched over like this, melting. [laughter]"
Hunter picked both sources and mediators based on their convenience. Hunter
didn’t just consult his mother because she shared his interest in the Ebola virus and was
able to point him to websites by the World Health Organization and other government
entities, he talked to her because "she was there" and convenient. Based on Hunter's
description, his friend on Second Life was available to chat at almost all hours, and a
remarkably good sport about providing feedback on his work on very short notice. Hunter
described one situation where he needed her to proofread and provide comments on the
content of his paper, saying, "Even if I finish and it's like three in the morning [before the
deadline], I'll just be like, 'Hey, hey, hey I need you to read this. I don't care, you can
have a coffee.' [Chuckles]."
As he left our meeting, Hunter confessed that he was afraid he had flunked
Composition II because of several missed deadlines. However, Hunter shared some good
news a few days later when he emailed me a PDF copy of his webliography. Apparently
he had turned in just enough on-time assignments to preserve his passing grade. I smiled
for Hunter's small triumph, as my fieldwork drew to a close.
Summary
This chapter presented contextual information and a set of case reports depicting
the information search mediation experiences of eight students enrolled in three different

130

sections of Composition II at Urban Community College. Some issues, such as a shortage
of time, were almost universal in students' experiences. However, others, such as the
desire to use lessons learned in search mediation encounters to become either a more
independent or interdependent information seeker, suggest intriguing contrasts in the
ways these students made sense of their search mediations, their information-seeking
journeys during Composition II, and even information-seeking skills themselves. In the
next chapter, which forms the second half of my findings, I use Stake's multiple case
analysis procedure to explore five assertions about common themes found across many
cases, and which in turn seem to shed light on the research questions that drive this study.

131

CHAPTER V

FINDINGS, PART 2: CROSS-CASE ASSERTIONS
The second stage of Stake's (2006) cross-case analysis procedure is the
development of multi-case assertions. The results of this process are presented in this
chapter as the second part of my research findings. Stake suggests beginning the crosscase analysis by returning to the original research questions, and identifying which
aspects of the research questions seem to be most prominent across all of the cases.
Overview of Cross-Case Themes
Five themes emerged and reflected the aspects of the experience of search
mediation, mediation's effect on the information search processes explored in this study,
and mediation encounters' potential influences on future information-seeking activities.
Organized by research question, these themes are:
1. What are the characteristics of information search mediation encounters as
experienced by Community College students?
a. Theme 1: Factors involved in selecting a mediator
b. Theme 2: Characteristics of the mediation encounter

132

2. How do students use search mediation encounters to navigate the information
search process?
a. Theme 3: Influences of mediation on the information search process
b. Theme 4: Influences of mediation on the presentation of information
c. Theme 5: Influences of mediation on future information seeking
After determining the themes most important to the exploration of the research
questions, Stake (2006) describes a process of identifying and refining multi-case
assertions. Multi-case assertions express one or more themes or the general research
topic, in this case information search mediation, across many or all of the cases in the
study. After completing an iterative process of considering and comparing cases and
individual case findings to one another, six assertions relevant across multiple students'
experiences emerged from the data. Five of these assertions relate to one of the specific
themes relevant to the research questions, and the sixth assertion is applicable more
broadly to information search mediation as a topic, or quintain. In this chapter I will
present and discuss the significance of these assertions, provide supporting and
complicating data, and identify potential implications to be explored further in the next
chapter, my discussion of the case findings.
Assertion 1 (Selecting a Mediator):
Information seekers selected mediators who they believed could address their needs.
Assertion 1, the assertion relevant to characteristics of participants' descriptions of
how they selected mediators to help them with their information seeking, may seem
obvious to the point of triteness. However, it is no longer enough to understand who these
133

information seekers asked for help, as Kuhlthau (2004) and Tsai (2012) did, but rather the
possible reasons why they selected the mediators they did. In this study, different
students described different types or levels of search uncertainty, depending on personal
information-seeking weaknesses, issues specific to their particular topics or assignments,
or the challenges of the context in which they undertook the search. These individual
needs led to a variety of idiosyncratic rationales in selecting search mediators. However,
this variety masks a deeper common truth about selecting search mediators. Students in
this study selected the mediators not due to ignorance of other alternatives, but instead
because they trusted those mediators to most effectively and efficiently guide them to the
information they needed to complete their assignments and meet their goals.
The students interviewed for this study claimed to have a good understanding of
their strengths and weaknesses as information seekers. For instance, Gary was very
candid about the intellectual and emotional struggles he faced as a nontraditional student
who needed to take quite a few developmental courses to become ready for college work.
For that reason, he latched on to a librarian at his campus very early on in his time at
UCC, and continued to consult with him even when that librarian's job responsibilities
changed. Gary also specifically noted his challenges with keyword searches, and that he
selected a mediator that he thought could help with that weakness. In a similar vein,
Becky not only struggled with constructing database searches, she had rarely used a
computer before returning to college. As she noted, "I didn't know how to send an email
or anything. It was really bad. I was in bad shape." Therefore, she found a helpful
professional who worked at the Forum (student computer lab and commons area) help
desk, and consulted him on both technical and information search-related questions.

134

Students also mentioned seeking out particular search mediators who they thought
would be the most helpful with their particular topics. The most notable example of this
dynamic was Kaliq. For his older and slightly obscure topic, a murder that took place in
the 1950s, Kaliq initially struggled with finding appropriate sources at the library or in
Google. For that reason, he reached out to journalism professors at several universities
beyond UCC to determine if there were better resources or strategies he could use for this
particular topic.
In a subtler way two other students took similar strategies in selecting mediators.
Hunter, while seeking information on Ebola for his webliography, consulted with his
mother, who had an interest in the epidemic and looked up a great deal of information
online. She directed him to several useful resources such as the CDC website. Frank, who
valued his family and community as the most important resource in his life, consulted a
relative with a PhD, assuming she would know about the nuances of Antigone simply
because of her degree. She opted not to help him with his information need, but spoke to
a deeper challenge, his insecurity about exploring a topic very foreign to his knowledge
base and background. As Frank related, his niece responded, "'You're a writer. You can
do this. You can do this.' And I ended up making an A on the paper".
Finally, students in this study reported approaching search mediators best
positioned to help them account for challenges created by the contexts in which they were
doing their searches, most often a time shortage caused by jobs, families, and other nonclass activities. Kaliq, for instance, didn't just approach experts in journalism because he
thought they would provide the best searching strategies; he also approached them
because they would provide the most efficient searching strategies. In a similar vein,

135

Hunter regularly approached a friend he knew on the online community Second Life for
feedback because she was always around, especially at odd hours, and was surprisingly
willing to help him meet tight deadlines. "Even if I finish and it's like three in the
morning [before the deadline], I'll just be like, 'Hey, hey, hey I need you to read this. I
don't care, you can have a coffee.' [chuckles]."
Gary, Becky, Kaliq, Hunter, and Frank all shared one or more rationales for
selecting the mediators they did. Each of them either shared or implied a rationale for
asking a given person for help with challenges to their information seeking. These
rationales seemed to go beyond mere convenience or ignorance of other alternatives.
Unlike Kuhlthau's (2004) findings, most students in this study seemed to know the value
of librarians as search mediators, and several made favorable comments about the library
instruction that they had received in Composition II or other college classes. Some, such
as Kaliq, moved on to other mediators after finding few useful sources during his
mediation encounter with a librarian. Others, such as Hunter, were up against a deadline
and too strapped for time to wait for the library to open in the morning. Even Gary
seemed to gravitate to his librarian mediator more because of the comfortable, supportive
relationship built up during a long-standing collaboration rather than his informationseeking skills in and of themselves. In short, students seemed to select mediators that they
judged capable of filling their knowledge gaps. However, in many cases the degree to
which a student felt comfortable admitting their vulnerability and ignorance about a topic
was even more important to mediator selection than the mediator’s subject matter
knowledge.

136

Assertion 2 (The Mediation Encounter):
The ideal mediation encounter provided straightforward answers in a safe space.
In addition to the selection of search mediators, participants in this study talked a
great deal about what took place in the encounters themselves. As a general rule, the
students in this study tended to take a transactional approach to their encounters,
initiating mediation only when they had specific goal in mind. Students also seemed to
prefer interactions that arrived at what they saw as the core of the matter as quickly and
clearly as possible, though their goals were sometimes subject to change depending on
what happened in the encounter. Finally, students seemed to prefer engaging in mediation
encounters in spaces where they felt safe. In an echo of the previous assertion’s
discussion of the role of emotional security in mediator selection, this observation
suggests that students may feel a sense of vulnerability when asking a search mediator for
help with information seeking even when the topic itself is relatively innocuous.
Ana and Hunter were both very focused on using mediation to address specific
concerns that had arisen during the early stages of their search process. Ana simply
needed more sources on her topic, the BTK serial killings, and was looking for the most
efficient way to get to her goal. For that reason, she largely eschewed asking people for
help, and instead turned to Google, a non-human search intermediary that she felt she
could trust to lead her to useful information quickly. She found the information she
needed, but seemed to feel guilty as she described her choice in a near-whisper with
averted eyes. As the interview progressed, however, either my status as a researcher or
my lack of judgment about her information search strategy made her feel confident
enough with me to assert, "Yeah, Google, you're my best friend." Hunter, on the other

137

hand, conducted all of his mediation encounters with human beings, but had similarly
focused goals. He knew his mother was familiar with reliable online sources on his
research topic of Ebola, and she indeed pointed him in a way that took him where he
wanted to go. Later, as he was preparing his webliography in the final stage of the search
process, he contacted his friend online with the express goal of making sure that his
assignment was written well and was free of typographical errors.
The students in this study also seemed to prefer search mediation encounters that
resulted in straightforward answers to their well-defined questions. Gary enthused about
his favorite librarian's knack for giving him "good words" to use when searching the
databases for a particular topic. In a similar vein, Hunter tended to consult the same
mediators over and over for multiple assignments. He found the experience of having to
explain an assignment or topic to a mediator "frustrating", and preferred to work with
people who immediately understood his needs with little clarification. For that reason,
Hunter only consulted with his selected mediators (who interestingly did not include the
librarian he volunteered for at a local public library) as a last resort and with frustration.
Frank described his search for information on Antigone at his family reunion where the
niece (and PhD holder) who he consulted for help reframed the problem and gave him the
reassurance that he didn't realize he needed. However, it seems unlikely that a mediator
who was less convinced of his skills as a writer could have helped Frank look at his
problem through a different lens.
Running through Frank's mediation experience at his family reunion, and most of
the other encounters shared in this study, is an undertone of fear and vulnerability. Few
students stated outright that they were scared to ask for help. However, an undertone of

138

anxiety and uncertainty existed in several of their comments, particularly Ana's guilty
confession that she preferred Google to a human librarian, and most students' preferences
to return over and over again to a few trusted friends and experts. However, the most
evocative description of the vulnerability inherent to search mediation came from Becky,
the self-described "computer illiterate" student who struggled to search library databases
at a time when she could barely manage to set margins in Word.
Becky luckily found a helpful mediator in Kevin, the help desk staff member at
the Forum's computer lab. She latched on to him for all her information needs, from style
formatting to narrowing searches in the library databases. As our conversation
progressed, she shared a moving description of the vulnerability she felt when in a
position of needing help, and the importance of finding a person she could trust to guide
her through an unfamiliar landscape. As she put it,
Sometimes you come in here and he might be gone to lunch or one of them might
be gone, and you don't want to want to sit here for an hour or maybe even have to
go home and delay it for a whole day. …Setting up Word, getting onto Academic
Search Premier, getting your sources, if you can't do any of that you're just stuck
until someone can help you.
For Becky and others in this study, engaging with a search mediator seems most
likely to take place when the feelings of vulnerability caused by asking for help are
outweighed by the fear of failing in her information search—and by extension, her
assignment. Students' apparent preferences for limiting their mediation encounters to the
bare minimum needed, what Hunter called a "last resort," seems to be a rational choice
from their perspectives. In the interests of not drawing un-needed attention to my

139

positionality as an instruction librarian, I did not ask students why they did not consult
librarians or consulted non-librarian mediators. However, based on my findings in the
pilot study for this dissertation (S. Clark, 2014), it seems possible that the participants in
this study may have found the prospect of asking an unfamiliar authority figure for help
to be too intimidating a prospect. A student like Ana may intellectually understand from
her information literacy instruction sessions that librarians are skilled, friendly
information professionals. However, based on these students’ choices and behaviors
during mediation, it seems possible that an information seeker's sense of security may be
as important an element as a mediator's actual knowledge for a successful completion of
a mediation encounter.
Assertion 3 (The Search Process):
Students typically used lessons learned via mediation to address perceived
weaknesses in their information search abilities needed to complete their assigned
information search.
The search mediation encounters explored in this study took place within the
context of a broader information search process. For that reason, the bulk of the students’
interview responses explored the influence of mediation on the search process as a whole.
In addition, some of the classroom observation sessions provided insights into this area as
well. When considering the data set as a whole, it seems that students typically sought out
and engaged in mediation encounters that targeted their perceived information-seeking
weaknesses, in the hopes of gaining cognitive, emotional, and procedural insights that
would aid them in finding and synthesizing the information they need. This supposition
was borne out by students’ own assessments of their mediation encounters. Encounters

140

perceived as most successful seemed to have positive influences on the remainder of the
information search.
When writing her paper and presentation on readers’ attitudes about Cozy
mystery novels, Danielle struggled with finding sources she considered reliable or, in her
words, “real.” For that reason, she consulted Mrs. B, who she knew could explain both
what reliable sources looked like and where to find them. Based on what Danielle learned
from Mrs. B, her searching activities focused closely on the library databases. She also
used Mrs. B’s criteria to evaluate websites and other less scholarly sources. By contrast,
Kaliq chose not to use the tactical search skills provided by the journalism professors he
contacted specifically for that purpose. They provided him the advice he needed on how
best to acquire old newspaper articles and other primary sources not readily accessible on
Google or the library’s resources. However, Kaliq chose not to take that route, deciding
based on the time available that he could write a paper that met his standards with what
he had on hand. That said, it would not be accurate to think Kaliq’s consultation with
these mediators did not affect the actions he took in his search process. Instead, he
considered the possible approaches, weighed the pros and cons based on a fuller
understanding of his options, and made an informed decision.
Mediators also seemed to influence the emotions that these information seekers
felt as they navigated the search process. Gary provided a particularly poignant example
of this. Gary seemed all too conscious of his weaknesses as an information seeker, and
that self-knowledge seemed to lead to a deep insecurity that sent him to numerous search
mediators. However, as the semester unfolded, his wife, his librarian friend, and even
Mrs. B encouraged him in slightly different ways to spread his wings and become more

141

self-sufficient, rather than asking for help every time he even hit a minor roadblock. Gary
began to take a more independent approach to the trial and error nature of information
seeking. He reported that he was slowly gaining the confidence “not to get myself too
dad-gum frustrated to just give up. …when I step back away for 30 minutes or whatever
it is, it's not that I quit. It's, I'm regrouping." Frank’s experiences at the family reunion
seemed to have a similar impact on the emotional aspect of his information seeking.
Hearing a respected niece with a PhD say “You're a writer. You can do this. You can do
this," gave Frank the confidence he needed to believe that he had what it took to make
sense of a relatively foreign and intimidating topic like Antigone.
Finally, an information seeker’s thoughts about and understanding of the topic
being explored seemed to evolve and become more focused as the search process
progressed. Intriguingly, though, students seemed less likely to use their search mediation
encounters as a means to make sense of their topics; instead they tended to use them for
procedural training or emotional support. Hunter learned a practical way to use
Wikipedia to wrap his brain around an unfamiliar topic from his respected psychology
professor, Dr. T, in the course of a conversation about another research assignment. This
was a serendipitous piece of advice, but one Hunter relied on as he learned how to
navigate the cognitive domain of information seeking for his paper on Ebola.
However, another student, Eric, challenged the implicit assertion in Kuhlthau’s
model that students learn more about a topic through information seeking. In his project
about careers in music production, Eric began his information search with clearly settled
ideas about his topic, based on previous knowledge grounded in his personal interest in
music. Eric specifically used mediation to learn how to find tools that would be useful in

142

finding information that was “perfect for what [he] had to say”. In addition, some
students, such as Kaliq and Becky, seemed to feel uncomfortable with using mediation to
help them think through a topic, contending that they wanted their arguments to be
“original”, in Kaliq’s words, or at least, as Becky said, to arrive at them “independently”.
Other students, such as Frank, felt as though they needed to bounce ideas off of family
and friends in order to come to a complete understanding of a topic. As he put it,
“…They're not the final authority or The Authority, but yet they're going to be honest."
The students in this study seemed to use their search mediation experiences to
navigate procedural, emotional, and cognitive roadblocks of the information search
process. However, they also seemed to use mediation to fill in known or perceived
weaknesses that kept them from successfully completing a search, and rarely discovered
an unknown gap or weakness in their search strategies. Although these students appeared
to believe they understood their personal strengths and weaknesses in information
seeking, students who felt particularly sure about their knowledge and opinions on a
topic, like Eric, might not seek out mediation that could provide a more complex and
nuanced understanding of their topic, as well as unknown skills or coping mechanisms
that could help them complete their searches with greater confidence and competence.
Assertion 4 (Presentation of Information):
Mediation encounters varied widely depending on students' goals for an assignment.
Information seekers can and do have widely varying goals or visions for the end
results of their searches which, in the case of these students, were the completed papers,
presentations, and webliographies needed for their class assignments. All of the students
in this study began with their end goals in mind, and those goals shaped their information

143

searches in general, as well as their mediation encounters. Hunter, Kaliq, and Frank’s
stories are particularly pertinent examples of information searches that were designed to
meet four very different goals.
Hunter seemed at times to think of assignments as simply deadlines that needed to
be met to achieve a passing grade, rather than as opportunities to succeed or grow. This
was most clearly described when discussing one of his potential pictures that he did not
draw, his riff on Dali's The Persistence of Time. Hunter said, "The clock is drooping
down and I'm looking at it with a worried expression on my face. And I'm hunched over
like this, melting [laughter]". Because of his time anxiety and lack of interest in any goal
beyond moving on to the next deadline, Hunter tended to consult the most convenient
people possible, such as his mother, and a friend on Second Life who had a knack for
proofreading and finding holes in his writing. A few weeks later he actually texted me
just to let me know that he had passed. For Hunter, earning a passing grade seemed to be
his only goal for Composition II, and he managed his information seeking and mediations
accordingly.
Kaliq, by contrast, didn’t just want to write an acceptable paper, he wanted to
create an “exemplary” paper. For that reason, he wanted to go above and beyond with his
information seeking, and his decisions showed it. After selecting (and deciding to stick
with) his very ambitious topic of a 1950s-era murder, Kaliq initially wasn't satisfied with
the sources he found at the library, hence his decision to consult with journalism
professors who had in-depth research experience in topics like his. As discussed in the
previous section, Kaliq decided that the cost of the time required to take their advice
outweighed the benefits, and that he could complete his research assignment without it.

144

However, that did not mean that he lowered his standards for his completed project. As I
observed him during a peer review session in his classroom, he talked to his partner about
wanting to create an excellent project, and bragged to Ms. A that he had become a
"research badass." His drawing assignment and post-project reflection bore this attitude
out as well. He knew he had gone above and beyond in his information seeking, and
hoped that his efforts would be rewarded with the gigantic A depicted in his drawing.

Figure 10: Kaliq's Drawing
Frank had even higher ambitions for the outcome of his information-seeking
process. Frank, as mentioned in my discussion of his assignment on Antigone, was very
happy to receive an A in that class. However, for Frank, grades on research assignments
like his Composition II project on a mystery novel author were simply signposts on a
broader journey. Frank didn't just want to complete an information search that would
generate an A paper, he wanted to generate an information search that would make him a
more educated person. One can see elements of this drive in his comments during my inclass observations of section B-1, when he complained at length about professors who
145

created arbitrary and poorly explained assignment criteria that seemed irrelevant to
actually learning more about a particular topic. In our interview, Frank explained his
goals at greater length, and how information seeking and search mediation fit in. Frank
reveled in what he described as a "boundless" information landscape, and found
information-seeking road blocks and dead ends for his project intriguing, rather than
frustrating. For that reason, he consulted a wide variety of search mediators simply to get
other perspectives on how one could understand a given topic. Even if he found irrelevant
information when working on an assignment, he seemed to see that as a bonus. As Frank
succinctly put it, "Education shouldn't limit you, but it should expand you".
Each of the students in this study had different and equally valid end goals for
their research assignments, and those goals informed and were informed by their search
mediation decisions and experiences. Hunter simply wanted to pass his class, approached
his mediation encounters accordingly, and gained the information he needed to succeed
in that goal. Kaliq, as can be seen in his participant drawing and his reflection paper, was
focused tightly on getting an A on his paper. He was willing and able to seek out any
mediator or source that he thought would get him closer to that goal. Despite his genuine
interest in a topic he found inherently fascinating, Kaliq was equally ruthless when
further information seeking seemed as though it would take him beyond the point of
diminishing returns for his GPA. Finally, Frank's information-seeking journey led to the
end goal of becoming an educated person like respected friends and family members. His
approach to information seeking and search mediation was more exploratory and less
utilitarian than Kaliq's or Hunter's, but was appropriate to meeting the ultimate goal he set
for his own Composition II search process.

146

Assertion 5 (Future Information Seeking):
Mediation encounters influenced information-seeking behaviors in future searches.
Almost every student in this study discussed how the lessons they learned in their
Composition II search mediation encounters helped or might help them in future
information-seeking activities. These comments took several different forms. Some
students discussed how their mediation encounters made them more independent
information seekers. Others provided tangible examples of using their new information
skills at home or even on social media. Finally, a few students proudly shared their
experiences of using their enhanced information-seeking prowess as search mediators for
their friends and classmates.
Over and over in our conversations, Becky talked about her need to become more
independent in her information seeking. Having entered Composition II in "bad shape"
when it came to both computer literacy and information literacy, she found herself in a
situation where she needed to ask for help from search mediators for even the most
mundane tasks. Mediation gave Becky the confidence and competence needed to
complete future information searches much more independently. As she noted, "I feel a
lot more confident. I could do it on my own if I had to; I do do it on my own now. …I
can just get on there and scan through [the library databases]." Hunter, who fully
admitted that he only consulted mediators as a "last resort," was of the opinion that as he
gained more skills, he would need to ask for help less often.
That said, some students expected their future information seeking to become
more interdependent, as opposed to independent. Frank saw his preference for bouncing
ideas off of friends and family in his community as a strength of his information-seeking

147

approach, not a weakness. Similarly, Gary, though much more confident in his abilities to
stand on his own as an information seeker, didn’t necessarily expect or desire to become
a completely independent information seeker. As he eloquently put it, "you come into this
world alone and you leave this world alone, but God didn't make it to where you're
supposed to be alone while you're going through [laughter] the process."
As was presented in the definitions of information and information seeking used
for this study, the vast majority of information seeking is not related to a classroom
assignment. Several of the students in this study described how they used the skills they
had learned during Composition II to find and evaluate information in their daily lives.
Danielle described putting her information-seeking skills to good use in a way that
wouldn't have occurred to her before-- when helping her husband complete household
repairs. Eric took this progression one step further by using the lessons he learned from
search mediators to overhaul his social media presence. He described completely
scrubbing his Facebook presence of all urban legends, incorrectly cited quotes, and other
items that he now saw as misinformation. In these seemingly basic ways, these students
and others took the lessons they learned outside the classroom.
Finally, a few students specifically noted that they used what they learned to serve
as mediators for other students in their classes, an impressive sign of mastery of the
information search process. During my observations, I saw Becky standing near a
classmate before the start of class, helping her find sources and create citations. When we
talked about this encounter, her pride in her growing skills and ability to help another
struggling information seeker shone through her tone of voice and body language. In
another observation session, I watched Kaliq use what he had learned in his information-

148

seeking journey to help his peer review partner think through her topic and organize her
thoughts about her topic. Ana worked in a symbiotic way with her friend at the library,
paying back her friend's discovery of suitably "gruesome" photos for Ana's presentation
by looking for sources that would help her friend with her research project. Perhaps the
most poignant example of a student who became a mediator is Gary, who had started his
studies with almost no confidence in his abilities. Over his time at UCC, he gradually
grew to the point that he was actually being asked for information-seeking help by
classmates. As he put it, "I've had people say, 'I've seen you catch on with this, can you
give me a pointer in school work too?' And that makes you feel pretty cool."
Assertion 6 (Cross-theme):
Effective mediation encounters were those that that focused on the seeker's needs.
Upon taking a step back to consider all of these cases of information searches, a
broader assertion emerged about the nature of information search mediation as a whole.
Each of these students consulted mediators who they thought would be knowledgeable in
the areas they needed to improve in order to succeed. However, the amount of knowledge
a mediator had about a topic or search skill didn’t seem to be the most important issue
that determined a student's perception of an encounter's usefulness. Instead, students
seemed to evaluate mediation experiences based on the mediator's perceived
understanding of the student's strengths, weaknesses, and goals, and the usefulness of
their advice to the student's situation.
Ana described two major mediation encounters, one with a fellow UCC student
and another with her boyfriend. She described her mutual mediation session with her
friend in glowing terms, as each helped the other find resources they needed for their

149

topic. Her boyfriend, however, didn’t fare nearly as well in Ana's description. She
seemed to feel that he didn’t understand how important it was to her to write as well as
possible, and was not terribly reassured by his somewhat perfunctory statements that the
argument laid out in her paper was fine. Kaliq didn’t report unalloyed success with either
of his mediation encounters, though he found them both useful in their way. The librarian
at the UCC branch library didn’t have easy access to resources that Kaliq needed to meet
his ambitious goals, and so he searched further afield. That search eventually led to the
outside journalism professors, who gave him advice that he knew was excellent.
However, Kaliq ultimately chose to go a different way. Although he very much wanted to
get an A on his paper, he had to juggle that goal with a full time job, a full time course
load, and two school-aged children.
One of Frank's mediators may have understood what he needed better than he
did. At his family reunion, he was walking around, asking random relatives about
Antigone. However, his niece understood that what Frank really needed from a search
mediator was reassurance that he could find what he needed, and she gave him that
emotional support. Frank's classmate Danielle was mostly comfortable with her
information seeking, but needed concrete advice on evaluating sources. Mrs. B, whose
teaching experience and library degree gave her the perspective to understand this
common concern of students, provided some clear and useful tips.
Gary didn’t get the answer he wanted when several of his mediators encouraged
him to start taking a more independent approach to his information seeking. Upon
reflection, however, he realized that he needed his wife, his favorite librarian, and is
professor to reassure him that he was ready to spread his wings. Hunter's favorite

150

professor, Dr. T, seemed to understand that Hunter wanted the most direct route to learn
the basics of his topic quickly, and he suggested Wikipedia as a good place to start. Eric,
similarly to Danielle, consulted Mrs. B regularly when he had a question about whether a
source was accurate, and he found her mediation helpful for similar reasons. Finally,
Becky exclusively depended on Kevin at the IT help desk during her information seeking,
because he understood her anxieties and had the knowledge she needed, even if some of
her information-seeking needs were likely beyond his job description.
Each of these different mediation experiences is bound by a common theme:
Students evaluated the usefulness and effectiveness of a search mediation encounter
based on how it met their actual needs, even if the mediation encounter may have covered
different territory than the explicit question. In a similar vein, students like Kaliq whose
question was merely a surface expression of a deeper concern, were left unsatisfied by
encounters that didn't address the totality of the information search need. Understanding
information seekers' personal needs and concerns can be challenging, especially when the
information seeker may not fully understand those needs him or herself. However, a
successful information search mediation encounter seems to be one that most fully
responds to a seeker's explicit and implicit needs.
Summary
After considering the case reports of eight Composition II students' information
search experiences as a whole, six assertions about aspects of information search
mediation emerged from the case-level findings. First, information seekers selected
mediators who they believed could address their needs for knowledge of their topic or
information-seeking strategies, as well as provide a sense of security and acceptance

151

strong enough to allow them to admit their knowledge gaps. Second, the ideal mediation
encounter provided straightforward answers in a safe space. Third, students typically
used mediation to address perceived weaknesses in their information search abilities.
Fourth, mediation encounters varied widely depending on students' goals for an
assignment. Fifth, mediation encounters influenced information-seeking behaviors in
future searches. Finally, effective mediation encounters focused on the seeker's needs.
I contend that each of these cross-case assertions about information search
mediation has potential implications for the scholarly field of information literacy, and
practical implications for reference librarians, library instructors, and academic library
policymakers. In the next and final chapter of this dissertation, I will summarize the
preceding five chapters, before discussing each cross-case assertion in the light of
relevant theoretical and conceptual lenses. After providing a fuller exploration of the
potential strengths and weaknesses of this study, I will then explore the possible
implications of each of the six cross-case assertions for information literacy research,
theory, and practice. I will close the chapter, and this dissertation, with suggested areas
for further research into this fascinating aspect of information-seeking behavior.

152

CHAPTER VI

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this study was to explore lower-division undergraduate students’
thoughts, feelings, and actions as they engaged in and reflected on their information
search mediation encounters over the course of a course-related information search
process. Such a project has potential significance to information literacy theory, research,
and practice. As was discussed in chapter 2, information literacy theory has begun to turn
away from its progressive and neoliberal roots toward a stance grounded in critical
theory. As I will discuss in this chapter, exploring the lived search mediation experiences
of students engaging in course-related information seeking led to findings that may
suggest both theoretical implications for this emerging paradigm and changes in
information literacy pedagogy.
In this chapter of my dissertation, I will provide a brief overview of my research
project, revisiting the research problem, questions, and methods employed in this study. I
will then examine this study's findings through the Association of College and Research
Libraries' (ACRL) Framework of Information Literacy (2015). After exploring possible
implications of my findings as well as the limitations of this qualitative multiple case
study, I will conclude with suggestions for possible areas of future research.
153

Summary of Research Design and Findings
As discussed in chapter 1, the revolutionary technological changes of the last 20
years have brought parallel paradigm shifts to higher education in general, and academic
librarianship specifically. The academic library has been traditionally considered the
heart of the university. However, studies by scholars such as Lynch, et al. (2007) suggest
that administrators and other stakeholders increasingly expect their libraries to become
nimble, transformational organizations that take the steps needed to provide the resources
and support needed to foster faculty research and student learning in an undergraduate
context.
Academic librarians have responded strongly to this challenge, engaging in both
technological and theoretical innovation. Of most relevance to this study is the increased
emphasis on information literacy instruction and reference services grounded in
constructivist theories of learning. This progression is seen in the evolution of literature
on Kuhlthau's (2004) information search process model, the formulation of and debate
surrounding the 2015 ACRL Framework for Information Literacy, and the rise of critical
information literacy as a theoretical lens through which to understand both information
seeking and the role of the librarian as a formal information search mediator within
higher education.
However, upon exploring students' information-seeking practices, patterns seem
to emerge that problematize the assumptions surrounding the role of academic librarians
as formal search mediators within the search process. Kuhlthau (2004) notes that students
are more likely to consult friends, family, or fellow students than they are to call upon the
services of a formal mediator. Understandably, Kuhlthau argues that this phenomenon is

154

due to weaknesses in mediation practices, a lack of marketing on the part of librarians, or
both. However, studies such as Tsai's (2012) survey of undergraduate information seekers
suggest that students actually find informal search mediators such as family and friends
more helpful than formal mediators such as librarians. In addition, when Kuhlthau’s work
on mediation is considered in the light of work in the field of critical information literacy,
it seems possible that her dichotomy of formal and informal mediators may not be a very
useful tool for understanding what exactly happens in a search mediation encounter. For
that reason, this study examines mediation encounters themselves as they organically
occur, rather than sorting them into a priori categories based on whether or not a
student's chosen mediator is an information expert such as a librarian.
After collecting, transcribing, and studying the data, I began a two-phase data
analysis, following Stake's (2006) multiple case analysis process. In the first, case level
phase, I considered each student's experiences in isolation. I identified and explored two
to three key findings about that particular case, drawing from interview transcripts,
participant drawings, observation field notes, and other documents. Chapter 4 presented
the resulting case reports, alongside relevant contextual and observation data collected for
the study. Chapter 5 summarized the second, cross-case analysis phase in which I
examined all the cases alongside one another, looking for themes relevant to the research
questions which were found in multiple cases. Based on this analysis I developed six
cross-case assertions about information search mediation that held true for the
participants in this study. In this sixth and final chapter of this study, I will recap the
research problem and questions explored in this study, discuss my cross-case assertions
about the research questions in the light of the ACRL Framework for Information

155

Literacy, explore their implications for theory, research, and paper, and propose potential
lines of future research that build on this study.
Research Problem
As discussed above, scholars of information contend that information seekers’
interactions with search mediators play an important role in overcoming the common
experience of uncertainty and successfully navigating the information search process.
However, students seem to consistently select and engage with mediators in ways that
appear to experts to be relatively ineffective for learning how to navigate the information
search process. This “perplexing and enigmatic state” of affairs (Clark, D. L, Guba, &
Smith, 1977, p. 7) suggests that the current understanding of information seeking may not
fully depict the aspects of search mediation that are actually the most important to
students who are performing an information search.
For that reason, I conducted an in-depth study of students’ experiences of search
mediation encounters and their perceptions of the role of mediation encounters within the
information search process as a whole. I speculated that the findings of this study might
provide guidance for librarians, theorists and researchers attempting to understand how
search mediation encounters help students navigate the thoughts, feelings, and actions of
the information search process.
Research Questions
Based on the research problem and purpose, this study explored two main
research questions:
1. What are the characteristics of information search mediation encounters as experienced
by lower-division undergraduate students?
156

2. How do students use search mediation encounters to navigate the information
search process?
Discussion of cross-case assertions
The six cross-case assertions that emerged from participants’ lived experiences
fell into three categories. The first two assertions related to the first research question;
"What are the characteristics and contexts of information search mediation encounters as
experienced by community college students?" The next three assertions shed light on the
second question, "How do students use search mediation encounters to navigate the
information search process?" The sixth and final assertion did not relate to a specific
question, but instead provided a broader insight into the quintain, or topic of information
search mediation.
The ACRL Framework as Theoretical Lens
This section consists of a brief discussion of each cross-case assertion in the light
of one or more Threshold Concepts included in the (2015) ACRL Framework for
Information Literacy. The concepts are listed in Table 2 below for the convenience of the
reader. The fourth cross-case assertion, that "Mediation encounters vary widely
depending on students' goals for an assignment", did not map well to any particular
threshold concepts. However, it did have implications for the definition and broader
discussion of information literacy as presented in the Framework document. Finally, the
Threshold Concepts are ordered alphabetically in the Framework, and not numbered.
However, I have assigned each a letter for ease in reading this section.

Assertions about Question 1
Assertion 1 (Selecting a Mediator): Information seekers selected mediators
that they believed could address their needs. Participants in this study tended to have a
strategy in mind when selecting mediators. The participants shared examples of selecting
mediators to address one or several challenges related to the cognitive, emotional, or
procedural aspects of their information searches. However, these students' choices of
mediators were also influenced by the contexts in which their information searches took
place; these contexts included not only the locations in which the searches occurred but
also the mediators most easily available and the time left before a deadline. For instance,
the UCC library didn’t have access to the archived newspaper articles Kaliq was seeking,
so he turned to journalism professors who he thought could help him locate those
resources. Hunter, who admitted that time management was not his strong suit, consulted
his mother and his friend on Second Life in large part because they were available the

158

night before a deadline. Students' rationales for choosing mediators differed widely, and a
few mediation encounters evolved out of conversations on other topics that organically
shifted to information-seeking struggles. However, none described selecting a mediator at
random. Librarians or professors might quibble over some of the choices of some of these
students, but each student described consciously selecting specific people to help with
particular information-seeking needs or roadblocks that he or she had encountered.
These students' behaviors when selecting search mediators seem to align quite
closely with threshold concept F in the ACRL Framework, "Searching as Strategic
Exploration" (2015). According to the Framework, information seekers who have
mastered this concept are comfortable using a wide variety of search strategies and tools
depending on which seem appropriate for a particular search. The participants in this
study seem to be groping toward this ideal by strategically selecting mediators who will
help them learn new skills or find resources they had not considered. Each student's
strategy, or best path toward a goal, was influenced by different personal and contextual
factors. These issues of mediator and source availability, time, and personal skills
influenced the needs that participants identified, and in turn informed the paths the
participants took toward completing their information searches.
However, when reading the Framework more closely in the light of these students'
experiences, an interesting detail emerged. According to the description of the concept of
"Searching as Strategic Exploration", "Learners who are developing their information
literate abilities…seek guidance from experts, such as librarians, researchers, and
professionals"(2015, italics mine). I found this comment troubling. Many students did
consult people whom the ACRL Framework would consider "experts," but some did not.

159

More to the point, students described well-considered reasons for consulting people
whom the Framework did not specifically list as experts, such as friends and family
members. They also generally reported that the mediation encounters they had with
informal mediators were helpful to their information-seeking process as a whole. This
narrow definition of "experts" as the ideal search mediators in the ACRL Framework is
certainly not the first time library theorists have attempted to privilege, by definition,
certain types of mediators over others. However, the contrast between the "ideal
behavior" described in the Framework and the choices made by the participants in this
study speaks to a deeper tension between traditional models of information literacy and
the new critical paradigm.
Assertion 2 (The Mediation Encounter): The ideal mediation encounter
provided straightforward answers in a safe space. The students in this study,
regardless of their ambitions as scholars, typically did not desire wide-ranging mediation
encounters that delved deeply into theories of information seeking or source evaluation.
Instead, they were focused on their assignments. Students were the most satisfied with
encounters that gave them the answers to their questions as efficiently as possible, so they
could move on to the next items on their to-do lists. Any additional insights a mediator
might provide were seen as a bonus, but only if they turned out to be related to the issue
at hand. In addition to this practical approach, students talked a great deal about the ways
their most positive mediation encounters took place with people and in environments
where they felt they could be vulnerable about their information-seeking uncertainties.
Frank, Becky, and Gary shared evocative stories of mediation encounters with trusted

160

advisors who provided the reassurance they needed alongside search tips and subject
matter knowledge.
As discussed, all participants not only asked others for help, but also mostly
reported generally fruitful encounters. This theme suggests that the participants were
cautiously beginning to embrace threshold concept E, "Scholarship as Conversation"
(ACRL, 2015). According to this threshold concept, knowledge is created in conversation
with other people knowledgeable in the subject under study. In addition, another
threshold concept (A), "Authority is Constructed and Contextual", seemed to apply to this
assertion. This concept defines authority as "a type of influence recognized or exerted
within a community", and emphasizes that experts' perceptions of a topic's most
authoritative sources and mediators can evolve over time. Although the threshold concept
talks about information literate students coming to understand the weaknesses of
"authoritative" sources, students in this study also seemed to be arriving at their own
definitions of authority depending on their concerns and needs, in addition to or even in
contradiction to the characteristics experts use to determine authority.
Students worried about selecting reliable and accurate sources, and used their
mediation encounters to learn how to find information they thought they could trust.
However, when it came to asking for help, students described engaging best with
mediators who combined the type of authority they needed with a reassuring attitude and
context that allowed them to feel safe. If scholarship is a conversation, then these
students' experiences suggest that such a conversation can best take place in a context
where information seekers feel secure enough to let down their guard and discuss both
emerging ideas about their topics and challenges in information seeking.

161

Assertions about Question 2
Assertion 3 (The Search Process): Students typically used lessons learned via
mediation to address perceived weaknesses in their information search abilities
needed to complete their assigned information search. Each of the students in this
study described putting the lessons learned in mediation encounters to work throughout
the rest of the information seeking for their Composition II assignments. Even Kaliq, who
decided not to take the journalists' advice to contact the out-of-state newspapers for
copies of old articles, used the information he learned from his mediators to develop a
strategy that made sense for his information search and the context in which he was
performing it. In contrast to Kaliq's confidence, Gary needed the reassurance that he
could perform information seeking on his own more than he needed any particular
advice. After his supportive mediators pushed him out of the nest, he found that he
indeed had developed the cognitive and procedural skills needed to search successfully,
and his confidence grew with each success during his information search.
However, the data was somewhat mixed regarding the role of mediation in the
cognitive realm of information seeking, in which students use the information they find
and the people they consult with as tools for understanding their topics in greater depth.
Frank, for example, made sense of their topics by bouncing ideas off of friends and
fellow students at the coffee shop. He formed final conclusions based on a synthesis of a
preliminary understanding of a topic and the feedback he received about his ideas from
mediators. Eric, on the other hand, felt that he already had a good understanding of his
topic at the outset of the information search and only used mediation in order to find
supporting data that bolstered that pre-existing viewpoint. A third subset, represented by

162

Kaliq and Becky, needed to think through their topics on their own after consulting with
mediators who helped with locating sources, in order to arrive at an understanding that
was truly "theirs".
This assertion seems to resonate especially closely with the threshold concepts of
"Information Creation as a Process" and "Research as Inquiry" (2015). The description of
"Information Creation as a Process" elaborates that "novice learners begin to recognize
the significance of the creation process, leading them to increasingly sophisticated
choices when matching information products with their information needs" (2015). This
can be seen with Kaliq, who used his mediation encounters with journalism professors to
make a sophisticated cost-benefit analysis about the potential value of obtaining archived
newspaper articles from the 1950s versus making do with what he had.
Upon considering these students' applications of their mediation encounters
through the lens of the threshold concept of "Research as Inquiry", a more complicated
relationship between assertion and threshold concept emerges. Although students
described becoming more comfortable with the iterative and complex aspects of
information seeking after consulting mediators, Eric described a search process that
centered around using mediators to find supporting information to bolster the opinion he
had at the start of his information-seeking process. In addition, the threshold concept of
"Research as Inquiry", much like "Scholarship as Conversation" (Concept E), emphasizes
the collaborative and interdependent nature of all information seeking and creation
activities. However, with the notable exception of Frank, most students were focused on
using their mediation encounters to become more independent and autonomous
information seekers. Students like Becky and Kaliq, thought it was very important to

163

develop their ideas "on their own" as opposed to engaging with others to identify "points
of disagreement where debate and dialogue work to deepen the conversations around
knowledge" (2015). Although the behaviors they described or that I observed suggested a
great deal of interdependence, these students seemed to perceive the need to ask for help
as a weakness to be overcome, rather than as a conversation to be nurtured. This
observation in turn may suggest that younger or less experienced students might struggle
to absorb the threshold concept that scholarship, at all levels, is a conversation.
Assertion 4 (Presentation of Information): Mediation encounters varied
widely depending on students' goals for an assignment. The students in this study
described a wide variety of goals for their assignments. Several students, most notably
Hunter, simply wanted to survive the assignment with a passing grade and move on to the
next deadline. Others, like Kaliq, were very focused on their GPAs, and wanted strategies
that would help them write the best papers possible in the time allowed. Finally, Frank,
though motivated to get good grades, saw mediation encounters as means to his ultimate
goal of becoming what he called an "educated person". As one might expect, these
different goals led to different approaches in information seeking generally and search
mediation specifically. The themes of convenience, usefulness, and exploration were
featured in nearly all of the students' interviews, but the importance students placed on
each of those three factors seemed to vary widely depending on that student's ultimate
goal for his or her assignment.
In contrast, the theme of broad, unbounded exploration seems to infuse the
ACRL Framework. Throughout the introduction of the Framework and many of the
threshold concepts, the authors repeatedly describe information seeking as a process that

164

becomes more complex as an information seeker becomes more information literate, and
defines information literacy itself as a means of "reflective discovery". The students in
this study described encounters and experiences that made them think about their topics,
information seeking, and information itself in more nuanced and complex ways, as I will
explore in my discussion of the next cross-case assertion. However, none of the students
described anything like the Framework's definition of information literacy as a goal, with
the possible exception of Frank, who might have considered information literacy as
described in the Framework to be an aspect of becoming an "educated person". Instead,
most of these students seemed to use the information literacy concepts that they learned
to be means to the ultimate end of a completed project and, hopefully, a good grade.
Assertion 5 (Future Information Seeking): Mediation encounters influenced
information-seeking behaviors in future searches. That said, the influence of a search
mediation encounter did not end when an assignment was turned in. All students
described ways in which the knowledge they had gained through search mediation helped
them in other assignments, and even in their daily lives. Some, like Becky, described
using the procedural tricks they learned to become more independent information
seekers. Others, like Danielle and Eric, used the lessons learned in mediation encounters
to evaluate and use information more effectively in their everyday lives. Others, like
Kaliq, Ana, and Gary, found that they had become skilled and confident enough in their
information seeking to become search mediators in their own rights.
As I alluded to in my discussion of Assertions 3 and 4, after their search
mediation encounters, the students in this study did seem to gain fuller understandings of
many of the threshold concepts described in the Framework. However, threshold

165

concepts A and C, "Authority is Constructed and Contextual" and "Information has
Value", seem particularly relevant to students' statements surrounding the ways their
information-seeking habits changed in the wake of their Composition II search
experiences. Danielle and Eric both gained a better understanding of the complex and
contextual nature of authority through their mediation experiences. Danielle might never
cite a YouTube video in a research assignment that called for peer reviewed journal
articles, but she understood that they could be very helpful when the dishwasher broke
down. More dramatically, Eric was beginning to "respect the expertise that authority
represents while remaining skeptical of the systems that have elevated that authority and
the information created by it" (ACRL, 2015), both in his scholarly work and in his life on
social media.
Students in this study also took away the understanding that, as the Framework's
threshold concept C states, "Information Has Value". Value is a broadly defined term in
this threshold concept, meaning not just property value but also value as "a means of
education, as a means to influence, and as a means of negotiating and understanding the
world" (2015). Eric acted in his new respect for source authority described above by
cleaning up his social media history, only including posts that he considered
authoritative, and adding citations to song lyrics and other quotes he had posted. If
"information has value", then Eric decided that he would only share the most valuable
information on the topics he cared about with his friends. At a slightly different level,
Ana and Gary both noted that they gained a great deal of satisfaction by becoming
information literate enough to be able to share the valuable lessons they had learned
about information seeking with others.

166

Cross-theme Assertion
Assertion 6 (cross-theme): Effective mediation encounters were those that
focused on the seeker's needs. When the previously stated assertions related to the
common themes of these students' experiences were considered as a whole, a sixth and
final assertion emerged. In different ways and when discussing different aspects of the
search experience, all of the students seemed to consider mediation encounters focused
on their explicit and implicit needs to be the most useful and effective. Students talked
repeatedly about encounters where mediators built rapport quickly, or built on a preexisting relationship. The mediators who fared best in the students’ descriptions of them
were those who looked beyond the immediate question to the student's deeper goal or
concern. One of the most memorable examples of this was Frank's niece, who knew him
well enough to understand that his question about the themes of Antigone masked a
deeper uncertainty about his ability to write a paper on such a challenging play. Instead of
responding with the factual response he requested, she was able to provide the
reassurance that he didn’t consciously realize he needed.
The ACRL Framework for Information Literacy (2015), understandably, focuses
on describing the mindset, actions, and key concepts involved in becoming an
information literate person. It includes very few details that describe the attributes of
mediators or mediation encounters that may more effectively help an emerging
information seeker attain the threshold concepts described in the Framework. For that
reason, it seemed appropriate to flip the theoretical lens, and explore what this final
assertion about the students in the study implies about the aspects of the ACRL
Framework that touch on search mediators.

167

The description of threshold concept A, "Authority is Constructed and
Contextual", states in part that "Authority is constructed in that various communities may
recognize different types of authority. It is contextual in that the information need may
help to determine the level of authority required." It seems possible that this could hold
true when considering the authority of search mediators as well as the authority of
information found in the same source. When the students reached out for help while
searching for information, they seldom chose to "seek guidance from experts, such as
librarians, researchers, and professionals", as suggested as a metric of attainment of
threshold concept F, "Searching as Strategic Exploration".
Instead, the students in this study typically preferred to talk to people who they
not only thought had skills in the areas where they felt weak, but also with whom they
already had an existing relationship of some sort. Even in the cases where the students in
the study consulted mediators whom they did not previously know, it seemed as though a
quick establishment of rapport and empathy was an important element of, and possibly a
prerequisite for, a successful mediation encounter. Not only is this human aspect of the
relationships involved in search mediation not considered in the ACRL Framework, it has
received little attention in the literature of information seeking. However, based on the
stories of these eight students and the assertions I developed about their informationseeking experiences, it may be impossible to understand how search mediation
encounters work without attending to the complex and messy nature of the human
relationships that are established before the start of mediation or even the information
search process as a whole.

168

Gaining Perspective: A Symbolic Interactionist discussion of Information
Search Mediation
Upon taking a step back and considering all six cross-case assertions in the light
of the ACRL Framework, a common theme starts to emerge. Simply put, no information
seeker is an island, and information seeking appears to be an inherently social experience.
The students in this study do not merely consult mediators to resolve simple knowledge
gaps about their topic or search strategy in ways that can easily be assessed as helpful or
not helpful. Participants also described deriving emotional support and reassurance about
their information searches through these mediation encounters. They also used mediators
as sounding boards to test and refine the ways they thought about the topic upon which
they were gathering information.
Because I approached this study from a Symbolic Interactionist perspective, many
aspects of the social nature of information seeking emerged from the data I gathered, and
are worthy of further discussion in this chapter. The ACRL Framework touches lightly on
the social aspect of information seeking in the threshold concept "Scholarship as
Conversation". However, the ACRL task force designed the Framework to explore
information seekers' relationships with information, not the other people who become
mediators to their information-seeking experience. Although the framework clarifies the
nature of the social aspects of information search mediation, it cannot tell us very much
about what the characteristics of these mediation encounters might imply for theory,
research, and practice. Certain additional findings emerged because my theoretical
perspective and assumptions guiding my methodological choice was symbolic
interactionism, and are worthy of brief discussion here.

169

As discussed in chapter 3, Blumer (1969) describes three central tenets of
symbolic interactionism. First, he contends that "Human beings act toward things [e.g.
the information search process] on the basis of the meanings that these things have for
them" (p. 2). This seems to be true when considering Assertions 1 and 2 from the crosscase analysis, that information seekers selected mediators that they believed could
address their needs, and that they preferred that these interactions take place in a safe
space where they could be vulnerable enough to admit their knowledge gaps. Information
seeking appears to be an emotionally and cognitively intimidating experience for
students, as depicted in Kuhlthau's (2004) exploration of information search uncertainty.
Librarians seeking to understand the dynamics of information search mediation should
keep in mind that these encounters can be much more complex than a transactional
reference desk interview or even a one-on-one research consultation.
Blumer's second tenet states that "the meaning of these things is derived from, and
arises out of, the social interaction that one has with one’s fellows" (1969, p. 2). Based on
numerous studies (including this one), students seek mediation for their information
seeking because of a sense of uncertainty. It seems possible that the past and present
interactions that students have with the culture of higher education could spark this sense
of uncertainty. There is evidence for this possibility within the narratives of the students
in this study. For instance, Kaliq mentioned that his previous college experiences and
feedback from instructors in the form of compliments and grades gave him the
confidence to take more risks with search mediation, even to the point of reaching out to
journalism professors to get expert guidance in accessing old, obscure newspaper articles.
Experiences with classmates asking him for help, such as during the in-class peer review

170

exercise, may have strengthened this confidence. On the other side of the coin, Gary’s
experiences with more successful classmates and his struggles in numerous
developmental classes before he even made it to Composition II seemed to lead him to
the other extreme in his search mediation practices. He continued to turn to teachers and
librarians for relatively minor concerns, even as they were reassuring him that he had the
ability to handle basic information-seeking tasks on his own.
Finally, Blumer (1969) asserts “that these meanings are handled in, and modified
through, an interpretive process used by the person in dealing with the things he
encounters” (p. 2). When applied to the topic of search mediation, Blumer’s third tenet
suggests that students’ understandings of the information search process, and by
extension information literacy, develop through interaction with mediators as well as
information sources. At this point, it seems appropriate to turn toward the definition of
Information Literacy proposed in the ACRL (2015) Framework. As discussed above, the
Framework defines Information Literacy as “the set of integrated abilities encompassing
the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how information is produced
and valued, and the use of information in creating new knowledge and participating
ethically in communities of learning” (p. 3). The Framework has quite a lot to say about
students’ interaction with the objects of information seeking, such as sources, search
tools, and the tacit and implicit rules of proper information use in an academic context.
However, it is far vaguer regarding the social interactions that are part and parcel of
information seeking.
The most detailed discussion of social information seeking in the Framework
comes in the discussion of threshold concept E, “Scholarship as Conversation”. At first

171

glance, one might guess that this concept would address the ways in which students learn
information seeking and information literacy skills through mediation encounters.
However, the explanation of the concept makes it clear that scholarship is a conversation
into which a novice seeker must earn entry by gaining a rudimentary understanding of the
field of inquiry. It does not explicitly address the kinds of conversations explored in this
study, in which seekers participate in mediation encounters that ideally give them the
cognitive, procedural, and emotional tools necessary to gain entry to what the framework
defines as the true conversation of scholarship.
Worse yet, this lack of attention to the common, everyday search mediations in
which seekers construct the foundation of their information literacy skills implies a
hierarchy of sorts, which might in turn be communicated to students being taught the
threshold concepts at the reference desk or in the classroom. New, uncertain seekers
could well conclude that the questions that spark these crucial conversations are "stupid"
and beneath the notice of librarians and instructors who have already gained entry to the
conversation of scholarship. This implied barrier of entry to the conversation of
scholarship could in turn lead students to perceive instructors and librarians as
gatekeepers managing access to membership in an intellectual community, rather than
guides along the path to greater knowledge and understanding. An exploration of this
very tenuous and preliminary speculation is beyond the scope of this dissertation, but it
seems very possible that a student's previous and current experiences with authorities and
organizations within higher education could increase their uncertainty and vulnerability
when it comes time to select a mediator. The data from this study also suggest that
information search mediation provides the collaborative guidance and support that

172

empowers seekers to construct their own sense of information literacy. As information
professionals who are inevitably part of Freire's (1971) banking model of education, it
will take no small amount of creativity, patience, and humility to gain the theoretical,
empirical, and practical knowledge needed to fruitfully engage in mediation encounters
where appropriate, and to support students who decide to seek out help from others.
However, if we want to strengthen both the information literacy skills of students and the
position of the academic library as a central resource for student learning, it is time for
instruction librarians and scholars of information literacy to turn their attention toward
information search mediation in all its forms and contexts.
Implications of the Study
The cross-case assertions developed in this study have important implications for
the theory, research, and practice of information literacy in academic librarianship. This
section will explore these implications in greater depth. Theoretical implications include
potential blind spots related to mediation encounters in the ACRL Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education, as well as a possible new branch of inquiry
for theorists engaged in the subfield of critical information literacy. In addition, the
findings of this study suggest a need for a better empirical understanding of the elements
that lead to successful mediation encounters. Practitioners may find these assertions to be
important reminders that college students likely approach information seeking with
different objectives than do the academic librarians who assist students in finding and
evaluating the resources they need.

173

Implications for Theory
The final version of the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in Higher
Education was presented to the ACRL in January 2015, a few days before my proposal
meeting. During my process of data gathering and analysis, I watched the early
conversations and critiques of the Framework evolve. The key points of this debate are
summarized in chapter 2. The findings of this study suggest weak points in the ACRL
Framework as currently framed. As discussed in the previous section of this chapter, the
Framework provides a narrower definition of search mediation "experts" than the diverse
group of people the students of this study seemed to consult. On a related note, the
participants in this study seemed to define "authority" even more loosely than the already
somewhat broad definition in the Framework. Many students in this study also conceived
of search mediation as a tool they would eventually outgrow on their path to becoming
independent information seekers, rather than the eternal aspect of information literacy
implied in the threshold concept "Scholarship as a Conversation". Similarly, no student
described a concept like information literacy as an end goal, but rather as a means to
passing a class, graduating, or becoming an educated person.
Ultimately, the main weakness of the Framework as it currently stands when
considered in the light of my findings is its' near-total silence on the role of the messy,
human process of search mediation in successful information seeking, and by extension,
becoming information literate. These weaknesses and blind spots are not surprising in a
document created by a committee of leading information literacy practitioners and
researchers for the national professional organization of academic librarians with the goal
of describe something like the platonic ideal of an information literate college student.

174

However, in my opinion the findings of this study suggest a possible avenue to further
develop and strengthen the Framework as a theoretical, empirical and practical tool.
Several threshold concepts in the Framework allude to the communal aspects of
knowledge construction and evaluation. This in itself is an important step in grounding
the concept of information literacy in a more constructivist stance than was the case with
the 2000 Standards. However, when examining the Framework in more detail,
particularly in the light of the experiences of students described in this study, a weakness
seems to emerge.
The Framework posits that an information literate student is one who "can
participate successfully in collaborative spaces" (2015, p. 1). The Framework's definition
of information literacy also states that information literate individuals "participat[e]
ethically in communities of learning" (p. 3). That said, the Framework in its current form
does not describe the successful participation it posits in very much detail. The first
threshold concept, "Authority Is Constructed and Contextual" simply states that learners
who are becoming information literate "understand the increasingly social nature of the
information ecosystem."(p. 6) The discussion of the threshold concept "Research as
Inquiry" states that students who are becoming information literate have dispositions to
"seek multiple perspectives during information gathering and assessment" and "seek
appropriate help when needed" (p. 7), but provides little guidance as to what appropriate
help might look like. The threshold concept "Scholarship as Conversation" suggests that
information seekers "seek out conversations taking place in their research area"(p. 9).
Perhaps the most problematic allusion to search mediation comes in the description of the
dispositions of information seekers embracing the sixth threshold concept, "Searching as

175

Strategic Exploration." The Framework suggests that information literate learners focus
on search mediation encounters with "experts, such as librarians, researchers, and
professionals" (p. 9).
Simply put, the findings of this study imply that the Framework in its present
form does not sufficiently grapple with the complex approaches that students take when
incorporating search mediation into their information-seeking processes or the messy
human-ness that embodies the search process. A cursory look at the stories of the
students who participated in this study shows that strategic explorations of their topics
often included conversations with classmates, friends, and relatives who helped them find
information with confidence and competence. Even many "experts" who students
consulted were not selected merely because of their expertise, but because previous
interactions with them had proven them to be helpful and friendly as well as
knowledgeable.
In my opinion, the findings of this study suggest that the ACRL Framework,
although a useful lens for examining the phenomenon of information literacy, is an
idealized, tidy model of information seeking that is far removed from the messy realities
of the undergraduate information search process. Further, I contend that the sterilized
nature of the Framework in its current form diminishes its usefulness for instruction
librarians attempting to use the Framework to develop appropriate learning outcomes for
their students. This potential deficiency in the Framework's conception of search
mediation is not surprising in and of itself. The goal of the ACRL Framework was not to
engage with or even describe information search mediation, but rather to develop a set of
core ideas about information literacy that would influence academic librarians as they

176

developed information literacy learning outcomes and pedagogy (p. 1). However, the
relatively vague and somewhat problematic depictions of information search mediation
included in the Framework suggest the need for some sort of theoretical model that
describes how and why search mediation helps information seekers. I concluded my
discussion of this study's findings with a very brief exploration of my findings and the
ACRL Framework through the lens of symbolic interactionism. My brief peek through
this wider theoretical lens suggests that Blumer's (1969) model and theories created
within the general perspective of Symbolic Interactionism could provide a route to a
clearer theoretical understanding of the social aspects of information literacy than are
currently found in the ACRL Framework.
2010-2011 ACRL President and information literacy scholar Lisa Janicke
Hinchliffe (2001; 2004; Oakleaf and Hinchliffe, 2008; Farkas & Hinchliffe 2013; Farkas,
Hinchliffe & Houk 2014) has spoken on the ACRL Framework and its implications at
several recent conferences on information literacy, one of which (2015) I was privileged
to attend. Among other topics, she noted that nothing in the Framework precluded the
addition of new threshold concepts beyond those described in the initial Framework. I
suggest that by making search mediation a more central part of the Information Literacy
research agenda, theorists could develop one or more new threshold concepts dealing
with mediation. The existing concept that "Scholarship is a Conversation" is a good start,
but I believe that more research needs to be done in order to understand the interactions
that take place in these conversations. If scholars and practitioners continue to treat the
Framework as a living, evolving document, rather than as a fixed list in the way that the
2000 Standards were understood, the Framework could grow into a robust, flexible

177

theoretical foundation for information literacy as a conceptual phenomenon, a curriculum
for instruction librarians, and a topic for further empirical research.
Implications for Research
The literature of information literacy has attempted to describe information
seeking in a series of increasingly complex and nuanced models, culminating in
Kuhlthau's (1991, 2004) Information Search Process. As discussed briefly in chapter 2,
Kuhlthau attempted to craft a similar model of the ideal search mediation system for
librarians to follow. However, as was also discussed, Kuhlthau's model of information
seeking has enjoyed much more acceptance and successful use in the field than has her
model of search mediation. Early assumptions that the underuse of formal mediators was
due to poor information literacy instruction or poor marketing eventually gave way to
more nuanced arguments of critical information literacy theorists. Scholars such as
Elmborg (2006, 2010) and Olson-Kopp and Kopp (2010) contended that librarians
needed to engage students' viewpoints more fully by embracing problem-posing
information literacy pedagogies.
However, after attending to the voices and perspectives of the students in this
study, it seems as though the real dynamics at play in search mediation encounters may
be more complex than either side yet understands. Although an attempt to build a model
of search mediation is beyond the scope of this study, the experiences of the students in
this study suggest potential factors in mediation encounters that seekers would consider
successful. It seems unlikely that the complex human interactions between searchers and
mediators could be described in anything resembling the relatively linear process models
that have been used to make sense of information seeking. That said, it does seem

178

possible that researchers could learn more about the phenomenon of search mediation by
exploring the broad assertions developed in this study in greater detail.
For instance, researchers could examine the typical information needs that inspire
particular types of students to consult mediators. They could also consider whether
mediators considered successful by information seekers tend toward particular behaviors
that may help them establish the rapport with information seekers that may be integral to
successful mediation encounters. Researchers may never be able to turn these complex
and often emotionally charged encounters into a tidy model like Kuhlthau's Information
Search Process or the ACRL Framework. However, they could possibly identify common
themes of successful mediation encounters that academic librarians could keep in mind at
the reference desk and when teaching students how best to consult with people, as well as
sources, in their information search processes.
Implications for Practice
The assertions resulting from this study suggest that students approach
information seeking in different ways than do "experts, such as librarians, researchers,
and professionals" (ACRL, p. 9). For instance, finding information is the end goal of a
librarian in a reference interview, and most scholars and faculty members also see the
generation of new knowledge by their students or in their field of study as an end in itself.
However, with rare exceptions, the students in this study seemed to value the information
found during information seeking as a means to another end, which could be turning in a
passing paper on time, creating an assignment that would earn a good grade, or
completing one more step toward the ultimate goal of graduating with a degree that
would help them in their personal and career goals.

179

This difference in outlook suggests that lower-division undergraduates may
understand and use mediation encounters very differently than do professional
information seekers such as librarians and faculty members. However, the students in
students do not simply consult the mediators that they do out of convenience, they choose
those mediators because they have a trusting relationship with that mediator. One of the
most evocative examples of this type of relationship is Becky’s dependence on Kevin, an
IT help desk staff member at the Forum. Other people probably could have helped her
with her problems and road blocks. However, Becky knew she could trust Kevin to both
know the answers and be helpful. Because of the strength of that bond, she felt that until
she became what she called an independent information seeker, she would only be able to
work on her project when he was working the help desk.
This study was an attempt to step outside the standpoint of an instruction librarian
and higher education doctoral student, and to gain a clearer understanding of what the
search mediation experience is like for students who are still grappling with the basic
skills of information seeking and information literacy. All of the stories in this study
indicated that relationships of trust formed either before the search or in its early stages
were key to a mediation encounter that a student would consider a success. It might be
possible that information search uncertainty causes students to have metaphorical
“blinders” in regards to trying other mediators when their preferred options are not
available. However, the situation may be more complex than that. The students in this
study all described highly complex lives in which they juggled school, work, family
commitments, and other community involvement. During an information search where
every moment counted, it could make sense to a student to stick with tried and true

180

solutions instead of taking a risk, much as Kaliq rejected the journalism professors’
advice in favor of a solution that would be good enough.
Whether either or both of these motivations are at play in students’ choices of
information search mediators, I contend that the findings of this study suggest the need
for a more explicitly empathetic approach to information search mediation. At their best,
librarians combine information seeking expertise with a friendly demeanor and
welcoming environment. However, the findings of this study imply that practitioners also
need to focus more on building trusting relationships with students before they are
needed. This could be accomplished through increased outreach and embedded librarian
services, and simply by being more visible around campus. Such personal connections
could lead those information seekers and the other students who consult them to see
librarians as mediators who are both knowledgeable and supportive. By doing so,
students may well find it easier to become vulnerable enough to admit their perceived
weaknesses or confusion to information seeking "experts".
That said, students will probably never only or even primarily consult librarians
when needing help with information seeking. Traditional means of student outreach such
as instruction sessions, reference services, programming, participation in campus events,
and marketing campaigns will continue to play an important role in educating students
about librarians' skills as search mediators, and to allow students opportunities to build
friendly relationships with librarians before being thrust into an information search.
In addition, many students in this study seemed to develop trusting relationships with one
or more of their instructors. Instruction librarians could extend their outreach to those
faculty members, training them in the best practices of information search mediation.

181

However, librarians may also need to accept the reality that students will and perhaps
should consult trusted mediators who are not librarians, instructors, or subject matter
experts. Librarians can then begin to develop new instruction approaches that give
students the tools needed to determine how to select beneficial search mediators, and
even become mentors to non-librarian search mediators in much the same way that they
have traditionally served information seekers.
Librarians interested in taking this type of integrated approach to information
literacy could improve outreach to and communication with both faculty members and
student support services such as the writing center, disability services, tutoring services,
distance learning services, and other relevant departments. They would also need to
educate administrators on the merits of this integrated approach to information literacy.
By training likely mediators as well as students in concepts of information literacy,
academic librarians could take on an expanded, consultative role outside the library
building. Ultimately, this process could expand the library's visibility, strengthen its
campus-wide relevance, and ultimately integrate concepts of information literacy
throughout all aspects of teaching and learning. In the Future Research section of this
chapter, I will propose three possible lines of research that could help identify and clarify
best practices for both search mediators and the information seekers who consult them.
However, first I will turn to the limitations of this study, some of which highlight the
need for further research on my tentative assertions.
Limitations of the Study
The results of this or any qualitative case study will not provide as many
transferable themes to researchers and practitioners as other types of qualitative and

182

quantitative work (Creswell, 2007, 2009) simply due to its tightly delimited context. The
intent, however, was to identify new perspectives on mediation encounters, a relatively
unexplored phenomenon. The assertions that resulted from this study may be fruitfully
further explored in larger-scale qualitative and quantitative research.
As Patton notes in his seminal (2004) text on qualitative analysis, “the validity,
meaningfulness, and insights generated from qualitative inquiry have more to do with the
information richness of the cases selected and the observational and analytical
capabilities of the researcher than with sample size” (p. 245). Although as broad a
representation of students as possible were selected for this study, true diversity was
limited both by the fact that cases were selected from one institution (albeit from different
campuses) and because the participants who volunteered for the study might not have had
experiences that are typical of undergraduates in general. Likewise, the study site was a
community college in an urban area in the southern United States. It seems possible that
the information-seeking habits of community college students may not be transferable to
other types of undergraduate information seekers. In addition, students hailing from
different regions of the country may select or interact with search mediators in different
ways based on local culture and customs.
As Patton (2004) observes, all qualitative research is limited by the strengths and
weaknesses of the research instrument; in other words, the researcher herself. As an
academic librarian, I brought knowledge of the theory and practice of information
literacy pedagogy and formal search mediation to this study. However, I also approached
the study as a skilled information seeker and formal mediator whose experiences and
viewpoint are likely very different from those of the information seekers who took part in

183

the study. Finally, although observation was a method used in this study, the use of
interviews required dependence upon the self-reporting of the students. It is possible that
students may have described their mediation encounters and information searches in
ways they thought might be more pleasing to me, rather than in the ways they actually
perceived them.
Future Research
Upon consideration of the current state of literature and the findings of this study,
I suggest three possible avenues for future research on search mediation. The first focuses
on the role of social networks in community college success. The second is a qualitative
grounded-theory study that would attempt to identify the contextual and emotional
elements common to successful search mediators and mediation encounters, and to
describe the interplay between them. Finally, it seems possible that, after more qualitative
research into the phenomenon of information search mediation, a quantitative study could
be constructed that would attempt to construct a multiple regression model of the
variables that affect student satisfaction with search mediation encounters.
As discussed briefly in chapter 3, community colleges are increasingly important
institutions for the success of first-generation, nontraditional, and other at-risk college
students. In addition, studies by Becker (2009) and Patterson (2009) suggest that
community college students may face special challenges in information seeking, and also
receive mixed messages about issues such as the role of authority in evaluating sources.
However, when considering the findings of this study in the light of studies on
community college student success, such as Karp and Hughes' (2008) examination of the
academic and social integration of community college students, it may be that community

184

college students use their social networks differently than other types of undergraduates
when considering who and how to ask for help with information seeking. A study
comparing the types of mediation encounters experienced by students at different types of
Carnegie institutions could provide insights that would allow librarians to better serve the
needs of their specific student populations.
A second potential line of inquiry concerns the weak theoretical conception of
search mediation as described in the section on this study's implications. This study
provides compelling evidence that students can gain important cognitive, procedural, and
emotional support from search mediation encounters. However, this study provides
relatively little insight into how such encounters work. In addition, the assertions
supported by the relatively small and homogeneous number of cases are both tentative
and relatively simple. It seems possible, however, that this research could serve as the
jumping-off point for a larger-scale grounded theory study that would attempt to develop
a model of the factors and contexts of importance in a search mediation encounter. Such a
study might follow the Strauss and Corbin (1990, 1998) methodology, and incorporate
interviews with a larger number of students and mediators as well as observations of
mediation encounters as they play out in real time.
A third, quantitative study could be conducted alongside the grounded theory
project described above as the second half of a mixed-methods study, or could stand on
its own. Rather than focusing solely on satisfaction by mediator "type" (librarian, faculty
member, classmate, friend, etc.), as Tsai (2012) did in her examination of students' levels
of satisfaction with various types of mediators, students could rate the importance of
various aspects of a search mediation encounter in determining how helpful it was to

185

them. Such a study could attempt to construct a multiple-regression model of information
search mediation encounters, incorporating variables such as behaviors, confidence
levels, and information literacy skills of both information seekers and the mediators they
consult. Such a model, while objective and simplistic by its very nature, could provide a
different perspective on understanding the key variables involved in successful search
mediation encounters, and by extension successful information searches.
Conclusion and Final Reflection
As I close this dissertation, it seems appropriate to return to the participant in my
pilot study (S. Clark, 2014) who was an early inspiration for this project. "Ashley" was a
struggling social work student who was reluctant to ask librarians or instructors for help
with her information seeking. She seemed to have bad luck when she did consult the
formal mediators whom Kuhlthau and the ACRL Framework would describe as ideal.
Her boyfriend provided her invaluable help in developing her ideas and finding some
information, but his knowledge was ultimately too limited to help her find the scholarly
sources required for her assignments. Because Ashley was unable to find the courage to
ask other people for help with her information seeking, she was unable to write the papers
required for her course. Based on the insights I gained from this dissertation study, I
wonder what I would tell her today if we were back at the coffee shop near her campus
discussing information seeking. I think I might say something like this:
The most important thing to do is reach out to people who you think have the
skills you need, whether that person is a librarian or someone else. Ask for help,
and when you find someone who seems kind, and who seems like they will listen,
share your problem. Don't be ashamed, and don’t be afraid. In talking to students

186

in my research, I've learned that most people who can help you will help you to
the best of their ability. Once you've talked to them, you will understand how the
advice and support they shared might or might not help you find the information
you need, both for this project and for others. And in time, when classmates or
friends ask you for help with their information seeking, you may be able to pass
on what you've learned, because you considered your needs, took a risk, and
reached out for guidance.
All that said, this dissertation has mostly served as documentation of just how
little academic librarians and information scholars know about the topic of information
search mediation. My hope is that this study will serve as an early step on the journey to a
fuller understanding of common traits of successful search mediation encounters. Such an
understanding could eventually lead to a set of best practices that will help academic
librarians guide information seekers to the sources that best meet all their needs, and to
teach those seekers the skills they can use to help their classmates, family, and friends
find and critically engage with information in all aspects of their lives.

APPENDIX A
RECRUITMENT COMMUNICATIONS
Note: The following text will be read aloud at in-class recruitment efforts, and a print
copy will be distributed to students.

Subject Line (if applicable): Research on finding information for Comp 2 research papers

Hello Comp 2 students,
My name is Sarah Clark, and I am a college librarian and a PhD student. I am studying
the ways that students like you find sources for your assignments, and particularly what
happens when you ask librarians, friends, or family for help. I hope to use what I learn to
help teachers and librarians learn how to more effectively help you learn how to find
information for college research assignments, and for information needs after you
graduate. I'll be hanging around in the back of the classroom and in the library for the
next few weeks to observe what goes on, but I need some extra help from some of you.
Would you be willing to share your experiences this semester? Your participation would
include a one-hour informal interview discussing your information search experiences. I'd
also like a copy of your final paper, and any notes you've taken while researching and
writing the paper. If anything needs to be photocopied, don’t worry, I'll cover that
expense. Also, your choice to participate or not to participate will have no bearing on
your grade in this class.
I take your confidentiality very seriously. Nobody, not even your instructor, will know
the names of the people interviewed for this study. Details about the precautions I will
take will be fully explained to you when we meet.
Each participant will receive a $10 bookstore gift card as a thank you. If you are willing
to participate in this project, please reply to this email/sign the sheet going around the
room/talk to me after class. I'll be scheduling interviews for the week after the major
class paper is due.
Thanks,

Sarah Clark

OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY
PROJECT TITLE: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE REFERENCE DESK:

EXPLORING UNDERGRADUATES’ INFORMATION SEARCH MEDIATION
EXPERIENCES
Sarah Clark, MLIS, Oklahoma State University, Kerri Kearney,
Ed.D, Oklahoma State University

INVESTIGATORS:

PURPOSE: The purpose of the research study is to explore students’ thoughts, feelings,
and actions as they engage in and reflect on their information search mediation
encounters over the course of the information search process. You must be 18 years or
older to participate. You are being asked to participate because you are a student who will
be researching and writing a paper over the course of this semester. I am seeking to
understand your research and writing processes, experiences with people you ask for help
when seeking information, and other events and emotions related to the paper-writing
process.
PROCEDURES

Participation in this research will involve one meeting scheduled soon after the
completion of your main research paper for the semester. We will discuss your
experiences seeking information for and writing your research paper, with particular
emphasis on your encounters with people whom you asked for help during your
information search. The meeting will last 45- 60 minutes, and take place at a location and
time that is convenient to both of us. Our meeting will consist of an interview lasting
approximately 30 minutes, a drawing exercise, and a brief discussion of your drawing.
Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed by myself, and the transcripts will be
provided to you for review.
RISKS OF PARTICIPATION:
There are no known risks associated with this project which are greater than those
ordinarily encountered in daily life.
BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATION:

You may gain an appreciation and understanding of how original scholarly research is
conducted. In addition, by thinking about and discussing your experience of researching
and writing your assigned paper, you may gain new insights that will help you with future
information seeking projects. This study may also help librarians and instructors design
better instruction and library services for undergraduates. If you are interested, we will
send you a copy of the results of the study when it is finished.
CONFIDENTIALITY:
The records of this study will be kept private. The data will be stored on an encrypted

USB drive for the duration of this study and any other projects that might draw from
211

these interviews. The main foreseeable risk to your confidentiality would be gaining
access to the encrypted data on the USB drive, which will be stored in a locked cabinet to
minimize the risk of loss or theft. Any written results will not include information that
will identify you. You will be identified in the study with a pseudonym, and possibly
identifying data will be changed or not quoted in the study. Research records will be
stored securely and only researchers and individuals responsible for research oversight
will have access to the records. It is possible that the consent process and data collection
will be observed by research oversight staff responsible for safeguarding the rights and
wellbeing of people who participate in research.
COMPENSATION:

You will receive a $10 gift card to the campus bookstore when we meet for our first
interview.
CONTACTS :

You may contact the researcher and her advisor at the following phone numbers, should
you desire to discuss your participation in the study and/or request information about the
results of the study: Sarah Clark, MLIS., 918-352-0883 or sarah.clark10@okstate.edu ,
and my advisor Kerri Kearney, Ed.D, 405-513-2043 or kerri.kearney@okstate.edu. If you

High manifestation means that the Theme is prominent in this particular case study.
A highly unusual situation (far from ordinary) is one that is expected to challenge the
generality of themes.
As indicated, the original themes can be augmented by additional themes even as late as
the beginning of the cross-case analysis. The paragraphs on each Theme should be
attached to the matrix so that the basis for estimates can be readily examined.
