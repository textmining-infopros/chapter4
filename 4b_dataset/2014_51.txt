Born Networked Records: A History of the Short Message Service Format

Abstract
This dissertation is a history of the development of the Short Message Service (SMS)
format, also known as the text message. The SMS teleservice that was developed by the Global
System for Mobile Communication in the mid-1980s for second-generation mobile networks is
made up of standards, protocols and infrastructure that make text messaging the most popular
data service on mobile networks. The teleservice has since been used in all subsequent
generations of digital cellular mobile telephony. The dissertation shows how SMS standards and
infrastructure represent a significant innovation to mobile telephony and how they have figured
in the history of wireless data transmission in the late twentieth century.
The standardization of SMS and telecommunication protocols that make the transmission
of text messages possible influences the future uses of these digital traces, including their
ii	  

evidential capacity, future access, and curation. As a new mobile communication format, text
messages have cultural, political, and economic consequences that span the world. Billions of
text messages are sent and received every day: they are used in personal communication, crisis
management, elections, mobile banking, business communications, and increasingly through
applications that serve as gateways to the Internet. Despite the ubiquity of this mobile
communication format, text messages are deleted, lost or overwritten at staggering rates by users
and mobile operating systems. Mobile traces such as text messages currently fall outside of
institutional digital archives as well as personal digital collections. This dissertation demonstrates
how the infrastructure of mobile communication, including transmission protocol and the
stabilization of the format, is integral to the curation, future access, and preservation of mobile
communication at the personal and institutional levels of collecting.
The dissertation examines the development of SMS by contextualizing the research need
for the study of mobile information objects in information science by presenting the importance
of layers of infrastructure to the creation and circulation of born-digital records transmitted
across wireless networks. It applies a research framework for studying new information
communication technologies and emerging electronic records contexts. The framework has three
elements: (1) Layers of Infrastructure and Context, (2) Examining Networked Recordkeeping,
and (3) Engaging with Information Retrieval. Using techniques from infrastructure studies and
media archaeology, it illustrates how the text message as a digital format has been enacted by the
mobile operating system on mobile phones. In turn, it shows how the text message format
structures mobile communication over time in different contexts of creation and collection. It
also highlights how the format is enacted in a mobile operating system: how text messages are
stored on device hardware such as flash memory, and in various end-uses such as deletion and in
iii	  

surveillance. The digital materiality of text messages in transmission, storage, and receipt is
shown to have social and political consequences for the future of fonds or collections of personal
digital records that people create with their mobile phones.
The dissertation also illustrates how the generation, circulation, and collection of mobile
telephony metadata represents a new form of collecting for institutions, under the law, and for
the theory and practice of archival science. It argues that new contexts of metadata creation and
collection have led to a mobile forensic imaginary based on the infrastructure and transmission
of born-networked records created with mobile ICTs. The dissertation finds that a more
productive way of confronting emerging mobile information objects and their digital
preservation over time is to critically engage with their development as formatted digital objects
and presents a theory of text messages as born networked records.

Chapter 1: Introduction
Staples of context
I began thinking about this project and the emergence of new records coming out of mobile
technologies many years ago as a practicing archivist while removing staples from mid-century
documents. While reprocessing a collection of more than two hundred linear feet of materials, I
spent many hours manually removing staples from documents and sleeving them into Mylar. The
subject of the collection I was archiving had been a poor graduate student, a government worker,
a university professor, and a diplomat. Over the course of his distinguished career he had a
variety of offices, institutional responsibilities, secretaries and support staff that created a mass
of records from his everyday life, both professional and personal.
Well into the second year of reprocessing the collection, I was able to look at the staples,
paper clips or fasteners that I was removing and could approximate the year, decade, office of
use, and sometimes even the secretary who had stapled the sheaf (one was left handed, while
many others were right handed). During graduate school my subject used straight pins and bits of
foil to keep papers and field notes together, during wartime at the Office of Strategic Services the
intelligence agency used large tin staples that looked like small railroad ties. Fasteners from his
work at the United Nations varied in size, shape, and weight depending on what delegation he
was working with. Even after I removed these bits of metal, the angle, the tack, and the curve of
the top left-hand corner of the documents could be seen clearly through the left over bite of the
staples and clips. Often rust or oxidation residue would be left over from different filing cabinets
that had weathered various office climates from the 1930s through the 1960s.
Most staples, paperclips and other office fasteners are removed from business records in
the general course of best practices in archiving and preserving records. These fasteners bite the
1	  

paper, cause rips as researchers read them over time, and often corrode and rust easily. The rust
will bleed through the document and sometimes obscure important textual information like the
address or date of the record. They can also be extremely sharp and cut archivists and researchers
alike.
In 2009, I received a text message from another archivist colleague in Atlantic City,
informing me that Michael Jackson had just died in the Bel Air neighborhood near the library
where I was processing in the basement. I couldn’t get any calls in the basement, or email
updates through my phone, but text messages always seemed to arrive. At the time I thought it
was peculiar that I was getting an update from the other side of the country about an event
happening less than a mile away. I also wondered how fast I would lose this text message, and
what structural context, or staple that might keep it together in the present moment, would be lost
in the future. Staples, and the structural description that they provide about the things they bind
together, can operate as a metaphor for how we approach the interpretation, identification, access
and preservation of records. I started thinking about what kinds of staples of context would be
sloughed off as part of the creation of cell phone records. Who would remove them? How would
they be removed? What would be the reasoning?
I have found, in this work on text messages and mobile communication infrastructure,
that there are many staples, or things that hold the records together, that will be lost or
deliberately removed or sloughed off, just as metal fasteners are before paper documents are
sleeved in Mylar and bound together again in paper slings. In this dissertation, I call the staples
of context for mobile records “traces of transmission”. These metadata provide information
about the creator, time of use, the formation and nature of the record. I find now, after this
dissertation has been written, that the staples of context for mobile records are being collected,
2	  

sometimes removed from contents of the records they bind together, and being used in ways we
that have yet to imagine.
While text messages themselves may be lost, deleted, or overwritten, often, what remains
are the traces of transmission or the metadata about how these records move across wireless
networks. Recently, the capture and interrogation of mobile telephony metadata in the United
States has been framed as part of the effort to protect against terrorism and to build a safer, more
secure world. However, the impact of telephony metadata created as part of wireless
transmission continues to be an under-examined area of interest for information studies. This
dissertation looks at how text messages, records created with mobile devices, came to be. How
they were imagined, conceived and stabilized as a new format that has become one of the most
popular forms of written communication in less than 20 years. I do this by telling a format story.

Format Story
Formats are how information objects move easily across systems, are accessed, organized and
retrieved by people. Formats also govern the limits or affordances of how they can be moved or
transmitted across time and space. Studying formats involves following the material, political,
and economic influences of their development, often these influences are hidden or carry
embedded limits and values from earlier technologies, standards, or political realities. The stories
of how formats come to be involves situating them in particular contexts and examining the
different people, especially groups of people (like standards bodies, or consumers) and how they
negotiate their interests and concerns in different circumstances and over time.
The study of formats and their impact on communication, information and society is
nothing new. Print historians, librarians, cataloguers, archivists, and bibliographers, have always
been concerned to some degree with formats, how they come to be, and how their affordances
3	  

and constraints impact their uptake, use, preservation, and the transmission of knowledge. For
archivists, the format is synonymous with form and has, until recently, referred to “a standard
size or configuration” (SAA Glossary, 2014). For example, for films, the format represents the
aspect ratio, or for records, the format is how the document is laid out. In computing, it is
understood as “preparing a disk for storing data” (SAA Glossary, 2014). Different aspects of the
form of an information object will interest information researchers and professionals for different
reasons. For example a bibliographer may be interested in the how the author or the publisher
becomes a stabilized part of the format of the front matter and publication of a book. These
categories will impact the book’s description and later its classification and storage in a library.
While a conservationist may be interested in the photograph emulsion of photo postcards, and
how these artifacts were mailed and circulated through a particular geographic area.
For technologists, computer scientists, and digital preservationists, the notion of format
“permeates all technical areas of digital repository architecture and operation” (Abrams &
Seaman, 2003, p. 1). Digital formats are represented with a series of properties so they can be
retrieved and sustained in systems over time. Formats, as representations of structured
information, enable the effective interchange of digital objects between systems and repositories.
The qualities that make up a format influence their effects of exchange and depend on the mutual
agreement of syntax and semantics of what is represented in the structure of a particular format.
Digital preservationists, librarians, and archivists have developed an international format registry
that provides authority control identifiers of formats, called the Unified Digital Format Registry,
which combines two existing registries: PRONOM created by the National Archives of the
United Kingdom and the Global Digital Format Registry from Harvard University Library.
These registries primarily provide information about file format identification because often, as
4	  

formats become obsolete, documentation regarding their creation, playback, backup, or
transmission is lost, discontinued, not published or publicly available. Format registries also
commit to providing digital representations in “human readable form” (GDFR, 2014). Despite
the international library and preservation community’s commitment to format registries, format
identification continues to be a crucial issue and there continues to be formats that are not
documented with unknown syntactic or semantic information about how these digital objects
maybe recovered or accessed in the future.
The data model for registries involves identifying the high level properties of formats that
range from the tool that is used to create or access them, to administrative properties such as the
owner or maintenance authority (Table 1).
Table	  1	  -­	  High-­level	  format	  properties	  

High-level format properties (Abrams & Seaman, 2003, p. 5)

Table 1 features the properties that format registries try to capture about digital object formats.
Detailed and authoritative representations of information objects are used by all sorts of
5	  

stakeholders, ranging from libraries and archives, to standards bodies, to commercial businesses,
consumers and content providers. However, format registries cannot keep apace with the creation
of new digital objects appearing everyday. For example, few of the leading public and private
format registries contain entries for digital objects created with mobile phones.
This dissertation is a history of a new format, the text message, as a new kind of digital
information object coming about of second-generation mobile telephony and now, the format
that has become one of the most popular forms of mobile written communication on wireless
networks. The text message is formatted, or operates as a format in different ways, first it was
conceived and created as a transmission protocol (the way that data moves across systems), and
then it becomes a standardized teleservice for the GSM which was the first wide scale standards
protocol for second generation mobile communication.
Archivists are often concerned with records or document genres as groups, these formats,
in manuscript collections range from correspondence, to memoranda, to personal papers and
business records. However, most formats are studied after they reach a certain amount of
consumer buy-in and are in wide use, or until they become inactive and their systems of
transmission become outdated, unstable, or old.
The advantage of telling a history of a new format this way gives us a few different
opportunities. First, it allows us see the impact that telecommunication standards and policy can
have on the emergence of new textual objects, even if they are not initially planned or imagined
to be recorded information objects. Second, it supports the early work of preservation, and we
know that format histories are the increasingly the fundamental work of personal information
management, and digital preservation (Lee, 2011).

6	  

Format stories are also an entry point into new theories of communication, information
objects, and the establishment of new kinds of records. Records, that document transactions
between people, organizations, and institutions are the basis for information studies, and of
course the core commitment in archival science. The format story of the text message involves
its stabilization, standardization, and circulation. It closely examines the infrastructure that make
these new digital records possible, including the metadata produced as they are pushed and
pulled across wireless networks. This dissertation is both an answer to a question (what is a text
message?) and a call for more work in the nexus of infrastructure, new forms of recorded
information, and recordkeeping practices that come from the convergence between mobile
networks, personal computing, and wireless transmission. Some have called this nexus the
primary concern for the future of personal information management (PIM), personal digital
archives (PDA), or data curation because the future of personal computing (including
organizational communication) will be tied to mobile devices and wireless networks. I am less
concerned with tying it to a disciplinary commitment and more interested in focusing on how
this kind of work crosses boundaries for information scientists, archivists, technologists and
designers, lawyers, historians, and communication scholars concerned with records of culture
and their preservation in the digital age.

Research Questions
In my dissertation, I am trying to get at three broad research questions:
The first research question is, if we assume that text messages are a format, what makes this so?
What are the layers of infrastructure, that is the standards, code, network architecture, devices,
platforms, policy and regulation that make such a format possible? The idea here is that the
answer to this question can help us understand what makes all sorts of people around the world,
7	  

from teenage girls, to heads of state, to micro-bankers, to disaster relief workers, all use this
format so regularly and for so many different reasons. Chapters 2 and 4 are especially concerned
with describing the layers of infrastructure needed to send, create, and enact the text message as
a format.
The second research question confronts the materiality of wireless transmission, and what
traces of transmission are made of. Here I am specifically engaging with second-generation
digital mobile telephony, and the processes needed to leave traces of transmission as text
messages are created, sent and received. This question is examining how these metadata are
separate from the message content that users create. What are these traces of transmission, are
they more layers of context, are they records in and of themselves? How do they shape how texts
are used and understood in different times and places? We’ve all heard that the NSA is “just”
collecting telephony metadata, and this second research question is specifically engaging with
the metadata that is created and harnessed in the process of network coverage and mobile
communication. These questions and their answers are picked up in chapters 3 and 5.
Finally, the last research question addresses the stabilization of text messages as new
records that people and institutions are collecting (and in some cases, not collecting). How do
people use text messages as records, and how is this changing or incommensurate across
different activities? This question is answering ongoing debates in archives about what Caroline
Williams (2013) calls “exclusive” definitions of records (classic examples of exclusive
definitions will be things like InterPARES I or the Pittsburgh project), and “inclusive”
definitions of records (think Brien Brothman, Kalpana Shankar, and Geoffrey Yeo), that are
based on understanding recordness through boundary objects, semantic structure, and cognitive
models. Inclusive definitions rely upon how people use and understand things as records. This
8	  

means, instead of satisfying a set of rules of what a record should be to ensure electronic
evidence, we ask, do individuals, do organizations, and institutions see these things as records?
Does the law accept these things as evidence of transactions? And if they do have some kind of
semantic structure that a group of people understands then we can identify them as, what Yeo
(2008) calls neo-prototypical or at least non-prototypical records with content, context and
structure. Case studies presented in each chapter of the dissertation discuss how text messages as
formats are indeed records, based on these inclusive and exclusive qualities. Chapter 2 provides a
review of the current literature that engages with debates about defining records in the digital
age.

Method
I use historical analysis to tell this history of the Short Message Service. According to Philip
Gardner (2006), this is the systematic and disciplined analysis of traces or primary sources to
make sense of the past. This is asking the who, what, where, when, and how to a collection of
documents created in a certain time and for certain purposes. I use techniques from infrastructure
studies and media archaeology to examine and interpret primary sources related to the
development of the text message. I am especially focused upon primary sources related to the
Global System for Mobile Communication standards suite, from 1982-1996.
A basic description of techniques from infrastructure studies is that they provide
researchers the ability to explore new forms of sociality that are being enabled by Internet
connected information and communication technologies, by examining the social, ethical and
political value of infrastructures, as well as changes in the nature of distributed knowledge work
(Bowker, et al. 2010, p. 105). This includes scales of analysis (Edwards, 2002), histories of

9	  

networking (Russell, 2006), infrastructural inversion (Star, 1999) and following traces (Geiger
and Ribes, 2011).
I also use approaches from media archeology. Media Archeology is a fairly new method
coming out of critical studies and media history that largely credits Michel Foucault’s later work
(Huhtamo & Parikka, 2011), and in this history of the text message, it means digging into the
reasons why this thing, this information object as a standard and then as a format has been born
and picked up and circulated. We know from media theorists that excavations not only tell us
how something came to be, but also how things work and effect this present moment.

10	  

Figure	  1	  -­	  Phone	  stack	  at	  dinner	  table	  

For example, consider the phone stack (Figure 1). The phone stack is a kind of game that you
play when you go out to dinner with friends that keeps you from looking at your phone, it
prevents participants from specifically reading or sending text messages. One of the things that I
discovered in my research of primary sources that describe early conceptions of data
transmission is that originally, SMS was conceived as a machine-to-machine protocol (not for
human eyes to read). The documents show us a very real transition or chance that texting could
11	  

have only been for machines or not for people to use for reading and writing messages. These
documents show the possibility that there is another history that could have been, a story where
we would use our phones only for calls and not needing to stack them because mobile devices
would only support voice telephony. We know from media theorists like Wendy Chun, Lisa
Gitelman, and Jussi Parikka, that all archaeology excavations of media not only tell us what
happened in the past with these technologies, but they are also are meant to elaborate our current
information realities. By confronting the technical conditions of emergence and the adoption of
this new format we can see how practices like phone stacking show the story that is and what
could have been. In one sense, the phone stack is way for people to connect to friends in the
moment sitting across from each other at the dinner table. In another sense, the phone stack
connects us back to this idea of being able to establish two-way connections with people by
using mobile phones to transmit this new textual format.

Data and Evidence
In addition to popular accounts of text message transmission captured in news reports,
legislation, and legal proceedings, I gathered and interpreted a variety of primary documents
created as part of the Global System for Mobile Communication. These included meeting
minutes, memoranda, reports, protocol drafts and updates, frozen protocols and news releases
from GSM, 3GPP, and the ETSI archives. I also examined messaging client applications from
popular mobile operating systems (including Symbian, Android, iOS, Nokia OS/Series 40, and
BlackBerry OS).

Scales of Analysis
By pairing approaches from media archaeology and infrastructures studies to historical inquiry
12	  

based on primary archival sources like standards documentation, I can go back and forth between
scales of analysis, and here I rely upon what Paul N. Edwards (2002) has described in
“Modernity and Infrastructure” based on Thomas Misa’s scales of society for studying
technology. Studying infrastructure at different scales produces different views of how
technology develops but also how they affect individual practices, like recordkeeping or
evidence building, and increasingly in social organizational practices, like business
communications. Edwards is building upon Misa’s (1988) framework for scalar analysis and he
describes the micro, the meso and the macro scales of society and how infrastructure can be
approached in different ways at each scale. Micro refers the individual or personal level, the dayto-day practices that make up our lives. The meso scale is the organizational or institutional
change that we see with groups of people in weeks and years. Finally, the macro scale refers to
infrastructure over long periods of time, decades, possibly centuries of civilization.
The beauty of approaching infrastructure through scales of analysis is that scales of
inquiry are adaptable, like a pocket telescope, extensible and collapsible with quick gestures.
Most importantly both media archaeology and infrastructure studies allow for the chance to
really examine the meso level of infrastructure, where people create and rely upon new forms of
information. This is where ethnographers that examine documentation like Peter Botticelli,
Kalpana Shankar and Susan Leigh Star all agree, it is at the meso level, this messy in between
area where groups of people are communicating with documents, where the stuff of records
creation, stabilization, appraisal and reception, actually happens.

Roadmap
The dissertation examines the text message as a format in three parts.

13	  

The next chapter is an introduction to the problem of locating records in infrastructure.
Part of understanding a format involves accounting for how it works, including how it moves
across systems through time and space. This chapter provides an overview to the debates and
theories of records as vulnerable objects, electronic records in archives, and the lack of concern
for digital materiality. The framework is directly intervening into debates about “what is a
record” by instead asking, “when is a record?” I apply elements of the framework in the
subsequent chapters.
The third chapter is the story of how text messages are conceived as a transmission
protocol in the 1980s, then standardized in the 1990s, and how they become a format in the
2000s on all mobile phones. It proposes two reasons for the success of SMS as an innovation to
the GSM standards. The first is the consensus framework of mobile 2G standards in Europe that
competing standards frameworks found in the US and Japan do not imitate. This is significant in
terms of the circulation and uptake of SMS, its ubiquity across mobile platforms, and later, data
transmission across third and fourth generation mobile networks. It is also a reading of early
GSM documents created by the Draft Messaging Handling Group, a subgroup working party of
the GSM, where mobile subscribers (users who are writers and readers of actual text messages)
are written in and out of the possibilities for texting as a kind of data transmission. It shows that
the SMS teleservice was a unique innovation to the GSM as all other teleservices in the standard
replicated existing transmission protocols found in landline telephony. It also features a short
overview of the parts of SMS transmission that influences the creation of mobile telephony
metadata, which is picked up later in chapter 5.
The fourth chapter confronts the format as it is enacted at the micro level of the mobile
operating system and in messaging clients. As we move over to using and relying upon mobile
14	  

platforms to create records, application and device constraints like memory and code govern the
format and circulation of text messages. This chapter engages with the deletion of texts, which
happens to many of these formats because of local storage, client settings, and privacy laws. At
the micro level, this chapter engages with the day-to-day practices of what it means to send and
receive text messages, and what actually happens when texts get deleted. This has stakes for how
we think of subjectivity, control, writing and reading these new documents. It also highlights the
primacy of context that users create and the context clues that are needed to interpret the
meaning or reception of texts in very real ways that are resisted by current platform
functionalities and messaging client design.
The fifth chapter confronts the creation of telephony metadata and engages with it as one
of the more considerable parts of the cultural significance of the text message as a new kind of
cultural record. In June of 2013, Edward Snowden leaked many documents, and has continued to
throughout 2014, that show how the NSA and the other five eyes (Australia, Canada, New
Zealand, and United Kingdom) have been collecting signals intelligence, and in particular,
telephony metadata in bulk as if they were business records. The definition of metadata is
important to the understanding and impact of how text messages are transmitted, collected, and
deleted over time. Until these revelations, very few, known and coincidental collections of text
messages were thought to have existed. In fact, as chapters 2 and 3 show, many texts have been
actively deleted or overwritten by users themselves. Privacy laws prevent most service providers
in the US and the UK from saving the content of mobile communications. This chapter engages
the use of text messages and their traces of transmission by states in legal and political contexts,
including the Presidential Records Act, and few cases where governments are using text
messages to suppress dissent or to address immigration. It also presents some emerging
15	  

obfuscation and encryption technologies that individuals are using to send next generation
messages with smart phones. Both chapters 4 and 5 ask questions about the current and future
possibilities of becoming metadata subjects as we create born-networked records that leave
traces of transmission through mobile communication infrastructure.
The conclusion of the dissertation presents an overview of what I call “born networked
records” that we can see in the stabilization and standardization of SMS and its mobile telephony
metadata as a new information object. Born-networked records are not limited to SMS, they are
in fact multiplying with the rise of mobile ICTs.
Born networked records represent a bouleversement to our present understandings of
born digital records in information and archival science. This rupture is in how we imagine
collecting information as institutions and as citizens with networked communication
technologies. Metadata generation, including the constant creation and collection of it by mobile
computing infrastructure create new collecting futures. A new collecting present and future that
traditional information institutions, like libraries, archives museum, and laws that govern such
records have yet to confront. The format story of text messages shows how this incunabula
comes to be stabilized not only as born digital records, but how they are born networked records,
impacting recorded information with the rise of mobile networks. It not only has impact on how
we conceive the effects of texting, sending or receiving, even saving or deleting them, it also
changes the future of how we confront born networked records collection, access, preservation,
appraisal and self-hood at the beginning of this century.

Chapter 2: When is a Record? A Research Framework for Locating Electronic Records in
Infrastructure

Abstract: This chapter presents a framework for archival researchers to account for the
transmission and materiality of electronic records research by locating them within the
infrastructures of contemporary, networked communication. The first section contextualizes the
research need by presenting the importance of layers of infrastructure to the creation and
circulation of born-digital records transmitted across wireless networks. The second section
presents a research framework for studying new information communication technologies and
emerging electronic records contexts, and reflects on why such a framework is necessary and
how it has been constructed. The framework, which builds upon records continuum theory and
the concept of spacetime, takes up the logical and physical aspects of Thibodeau’s digital object
model and applies Trace’s microethnographic approach to networked communication, has three
elements: (1) Layers of Infrastructure and Context, (2) Examining Networked Recordkeeping,
and (3) Engaging with Information Retrieval. The third section presents the case study of Kurt
Mix and the British Petroleum Oil Spill in order to illustrate the possibilities of how this
framework might be applied in archival research.

Counting Kangaroos
On a recent trip to Australia, I took a twelve-hour train ride from Melbourne to Sydney. Within a
few stops we entered the countryside and I began to count kangaroos as the train passed through
19	  

open fields. After seeing well over twenty kangaroos, I started sending text messages to
acquaintances back in the United States. The kangaroos were not a surprise to my fellow
Australian passengers on the train, but I wanted to share my excitement with friends and family
back home at how many kangaroos I had counted in the countryside. I had traveled to Australia
to present preliminary research upon the infrastructure of mobile communication. In my research
I examine how technologists, recordkeepers, archivists, and information scientists are
confronting issues of digital materiality and preservation with emerging formats and the
information systems that create, delete and store digital traces created with mobile devices.
Texting while riding the train gives us the opportunity to think about how we organize
ourselves around networks. Infrastructural networks, or large scale technical networks and
incumbent standards, protocols and the social institutions that enforce them engender the
creation and reception of records, which are also comprised of the digital traces of transmission
that produce such records. When I arrived in Australia, I had bought a Vodafone prepaid
subscriber identification module (SIM) card at the airport to send messages, access the Internet
and make a few calls while traveling. This SIM card allowed me to use my phone to make calls
and send text messages via an Australian service provider’s mobile network infrastructure.
Sporadically throughout the rest of the train trip I would receive a flurry of text messages in my
inbox responding to messages I had sent earlier in the day. After receiving a few batches of new
messages all at the same time, it became clear to me that the mobile data network coverage that
my new SIM card afforded followed the station stops of the train. The network would go dark as
the train traveled between stations, and I would lose the network connection at the places along
the way where the kangaroos actually were.

20	  

My inbox, with five or six new text messages, pointed to a fleeting mobile data
connection and eventually, I was able to predict when we would approach the next station. I
would reply as quickly as I could once the train was within network range of a station with the
hopes of receiving a text before the next train stop, usually forty minutes away. It was in this
fevered pace of playing catch up and responding to texts at each train stop that I realized I was
experiencing the limits of two types of network coverage. First, I was playing with the clock,
aware that as soon as a few more people got on or off the train I would lose the data connection.
And second, just as the train would continue speeding towards my next destination, I was
experiencing the possibilities of connection and disconnection through the affordances of
infrastructure, in one sense from industrialization by way of the train network and another, due to
the information age as manifested by my mobile phone and its access to network coverage. My
experience of “boundedness” from both networks was producing an information landscape as I
moved through time over the course of the daylong trip, and through space along the several
hundred miles of train tracks (Lindtner et al., 2012). As I traveled through this landscape I was
creating and receiving records along the way.

Information Landscapes and the Postcustodial Era
Paying attention to networks across geographical landscapes allows us to consider how
infrastructure influences the possibilities of records that can be produced, and furthermore, how
they are circulated and transmitted in digital networks. As mobile computing begins to influence
the fabric of social life, important research questions arise: How do we locate and identify
records within infrastructure? How does infrastructure shape the records that are preserved,
identified, and the ways archival scholars evaluate them?
21	  

We experience the infrastructure of digital information networks in our everyday lives in
the same way we experience other industrial infrastructures, such as trains, indoor plumbing,
central heating, or copper-wire telephone landlines. The absence or presence of certain nodes in a
technical network, whether that be a train station, a cellular tower or a Wi-Fi hotspot
characterizes modern living and the feeling of being infrastructured is something that we all
experience at different junctures in everyday life (Dourish & Bell, 2007). Network connections
(and disconnections) reconfigure the spaces around us, just as they influence the ways we move
ourselves around these networks because they enable a multiplicity of experience (Farman,
2011). Train networks and mobile phone networks create mobility; both networks move things
through time and space in material ways. At first glance, it may not be obvious why archivists
should focus upon infrastructures that create records (by which I mean information with content,
context and structure recorded on a fixed media). Increasingly however, records of our time are
created, transmitted and stored in distributed infrastructures and large-scale technical networks of
digital information communication technologies (ICTs) ranging from mobile phones to cloud
storage services. Archival scholars need proactively to locate records in infrastructure because in
digital information infrastructure the threshold between active and inactive records is dissolving
and the process of transmission is not well theorized (Pearce-Moses, 2007).
Locating such a threshold, or even discrete stages in the circulation of electronic records,
has proven to be a challenge for traditional archival theories and practice, and in particular to the
life cycle approach as electronic record systems have become increasingly networked and
complex. The life cycle model for records management, as described by Theodore Schellenberg,
was the primary model for records management in North America from the 1960s to the 1990s,
and in many cases the influence can still be seen especially as it relates to the archivist’s custody
22	  

over records (Bantin, 1998, p. 23). The life cycle model prescribes stages of recordkeeping in
addition to who will manage records and when, offloading specific management roles to records
managers and archivists in different stages (Bantin, 1998, p. 23-25, Penn, et al. 1994, p. 12-17).
Perhaps most importantly, it is not until records become inactive in the life cycle model that
archivists take responsibility for their management (Duranti, 1996, p. 252).
In the 1990s, scholars such as David Bearman, Terry Cook, Sue McKemmish, and Frank
Upward, argued for a new paradigm in archives. They argued that it should account for the new
realities of electronic record environments that moved beyond the discrete stages of the life cycle
approach and the limited archival oversight of inactive records only (Henry, 1998, p. 309). This
new paradigm supports a postcustodial era where the role of the archivist shifts from a custodian
over inactive records in a centralized repository, to the management of records over time,
beginning where and when records are created through the practices of use and circulation.
Postcustodial theory, as Frank Upward has written, is not the opposite of custodial, but instead
de-emphasizes the physical custody of records and focuses upon the transactionality of electronic
records (Upward, 1996, p. 4).1
Despite the attention to process that comes with postcustodial approaches, many
archivists are trained to think that whenever electronic records move across space (conceptually
or physically), they are at risk of having elements of record-ness stripped by another system, thus
rendering them as non-records (MacNeil, 2002, p. 28). These moments of risk for electronic
records are largely located at transfer points, processes of transmission that move information
through space and time, because there exists a possibility to violate authenticity and change a
record’s fundamental attributes. The condition of becoming a record also threatens that

A note on terminology, in this chapter “transactionality” refers to physical and conceptual transactions, where
“transmission” refers to the cultural logic of transmission in the digital age, including practices and social
institutions such as standards built up around transactions.

existence. When a digital entity passes from one system to another, the control over the
authenticity and integrity of that record follows. Such a “systematic vulnerability” has been
identified by some historians as a condition of high modernity separating technology from the
social and is not just limited to archival spaces of enactment and custody (Edwards, 2003, p.
195-196).2 Archival theorists have written extensively about what the era of postcustodial
recordkeeping signifies for archivists as professionals (Cook, 1994; Cook, 1997). Many archival
scholars believe that it is at these junctures of transition, that we should “reinsert” ourselves into
digital preservation planning efforts, especially through description and metadata (Bearman,
2007). It is interesting to consider the power of custody in approaching the problem of transition
because it is the archivist’s shifting custody over the recordkeeping system and the description of
the processes of archiving that is radically transferred in the postcustodial era (O’Shea &
Roberts, 1996; Upward & McKemmish, 1994). Yet there remains a dearth of work that theorizes
or even describes the archivist’s role, in what Manuel Castells (2004) has called, “the material
organization of time-sharing social practices that work through flows” (p. 147).
In the space of flows, the time between active and inactive records has become disjointed
and indistinguishable: as records are created and distributed across memory sites that range from
mobile phones to USB flash drives to gaming systems, they instantly become subject to backup
or digital storage (the so-called “archive” created by copying stored information across file
structures in data storage), even when they are deleted or deaccessioned. This rupture of time
with digital ICTs forces archivists to reconsider how records emerge in current networks and
how they are kept, transmitted and received across space but also where archival callings shift in
the space of flows. Locating records as they move through infrastructure relies on identifying the

Edwards argues that systematic vulnerability is a result of “modernist settlement” or that of separating the social
from the technological as theorized by Bruno Latour.

material culture of mobile communication and recognizing change: from devices, to cell towers,
undersea cables, wires and server farms, even to phone bills. Furthermore, archivists have an
imperative to account for recorded information as it moves through infrastructure, because the
mobility of electronic records through spacetime is an indelible aspect of their enduring value in
the postcustodial era.3
Even with the postcustodial emphasis on the processes of archiving and understanding of
complex transactionality, the transmission of records across wireless networks has often been
overlooked in archival studies and is not well understood (Upward, 2009b). This is possibly due
to the fact that infrastructure can be “mundane to the point of boredom” (Star, 1999) and that
wirelessness remains ripe for examination.4 It may also be that most postcustodial approaches
privilege logical aspects of records over the physical, and lean towards a tendency to treat
electronic information as immaterial. The ways in which information infrastructure moves
records from one system to another is conspicuously missing from the study of electronic records
in archival scholarship (Hedstrom, 1991). To address this gap, the framework I propose here
looks carefully at the historical ontology of records, or how records move through infrastructure
at the point of creation, transmission, and reception. The following discussion examines how and
why this framework was developed to address how records that are being generated today
challenge all archival functions as we know them.

Examining Electronic Incunabula in the Twenty-First Century
Margaret Hedstrom’s framework for analyzing electronic incunabula urges archivists to examine
evolving forms of documentation and to “think big enough.”5 Her framework drew heavily upon
concepts and techniques from the history of technology that placed electronic recordkeeping into
historical, social and cultural contexts. It was, however, developed before microprocessors and
the rise of personal computing and perhaps most importantly, before the Internet revolutionized
networked communication. Twenty years later, mobile communication devices, search engines
and social media platforms present radically new kinds of formats, or networked electronic
incunabula, for archival scholars to consider. Hedstrom’s framework for studying electronic
records begins with the consideration of specific contexts of information technology, starting
with the origins of its development and looking at the evolution of documentation and
organizational change.6 I argue that by examining the infrastructure of records, archivists can
think big enough about the “black box” and all the layers of construction behind new digital
records and emerging documentation practices (Latour, 1987).7
In the same year that Hedstrom published her framework for electronic records research,
Terry Cook commented on the problems posed by the transmission of emerging formats through
telecommunication:
Combining computerized information in these new formats with a telecommunications
revolution affecting the transmission of electronic records threatens decision-making
accountability and corporate memory: if an electronic document has no physical

As in the first outputs of the printing press prior to 1501, incunabula refers to “the earliest stages or first traces in
the development of anything.” Oxford English Dictionary, 1933, I:188.

A close reading of the framework reveals that Hedstrom describes infrastructure (through stabilization and coconstitution of the social) but does not specifically identify it as such.

existence, but rather is a “virtual” composite of disparate information appearing but
fleetingly on a terminal, how does the institution let alone the archivist preserve evidence
[…]? Where is the evidence of accountability of the transaction? Where is the context?
What is the provenance?
(Cook, 1991, p. 206)
If we update our approach to electronic incunabula to account for the infrastructure of large-scale
networks, the realities of instant back-up and distributed storage, and the processes of producing
and transmitting such digital traces, archivists may be able to answer, with confidence, the
questions Cook posed. In the space of flows of the network society “transactionality is rampant.
The distinctions archivists make between hierarchy and functionality, chatter and business,
organizational structure and authority, become less easy to make” (Upward, 2009b, p. 18). As
wireless transmission becomes more complex and pervasive in the twenty-first century, the need
to focus upon the processes of transactionality, and their means through infrastructure, has
increasing material consequences and archival relevancy.

Digital Materiality and the Physicality of Information
The materiality of digital communication in infrastructure is essential to understanding the
context, content and provenance of new electronic formats.8 In her microethnography of the
creation of a digital document on a personal computer, Ciaran Trace encourages archivists to go
inside the black box of the computer in order to understand the nature of born-digital records and

Materiality, as a concept, refers to the medium or physical format used to store information or a text. For more on
digital materiality and archiving, see: Matthew Kirschenbaum, Erika L. Farr, Kari M. Kraus, Naomi Nelson,

adequately serve the communities that they document (Trace, 2011). This is what Richard
Pearce-Moses (2007) has identified as “under-the-hood IT skills” (p. 13) for archivists. The
digital materiality of records is an underdeveloped area of scholarship in archival studies, in part
because electronic records are often seen as being without physicality:
[T]he record remains a problematic construct even within the archival community.
Within the U.S., there is insufficient common understanding of the nature of the record
and how the record as a construct might be operationalized in digital environments, such
as distributed and multiprovenancial databases where there is often not a readily
discernible physical information object that corresponds to paper notions of a record.
(Gilliland, 2005, p. 219)
Over the past two decades, the “problematic construct” of the record has persisted in archival
research, in part, because how records exist across distributed environments is not welldocumented (through microethnography or otherwise) or understood in material ways. While
recent work examines the nature of the record in digital environments as constructs at the
conceptual level, there is little research that examines records as material things that move
through systems with physical constraints such as storage memory, or devices.9
The 1990s saw two influential research projects that sought to identify the functional
requirements for preserving electronic evidence: the University of Pittsburgh Electronics

While the Pittsburgh Project advocated a new postcustodial paradigm shift, the UBC-MAS
Research Project tested the validity of traditional diplomatic and archival concepts in electronic
records systems. The UBC-MAS project identified an archival threshold for electronic
recordkeeping systems, as a “space beyond which no alteration or permutation is possible, and
where every written act can be treated as evidence and memory” (Duranti, 1996, p. 252). The
Pittsburgh Project identified a new postcustodial paradigm to preserve evidence and develop
strategies for archivists’ distributed governance over electronic records corpora. Instead of
applying tests of validity to recordkeeping systems or requiring application models as UBCMAS advocated, the Pittsburgh Project developed best practices for distributed custody informed
by the latest research in the legal, records management and information technology professions.
Or as Philip C. Bantin described, “a distributed strategy for custody [that] necessitates the
creation of legally binding agreements with offices, of reliable means of auditing records, of an
extensive network of training programs, and of other mechanisms designed to ensure that
custodians of records understand their responsibilities and are living up to those expectations”
(1998, p. 23). In both projects the materiality of electronic records is understated, this is largely
due to a focus on evidence as a logical concept.
Herein lies a deep fold in archival theories of electronic records. The materiality of
electronic records—the processes of their production, transmission and storage—has been at
once overlooked and overtaken by an unrelenting commitment to definitions. Whether these
definitions are tied to early eras of traditional archives and analog recordkeeping, or to the
distributed model of professional responsibility and functional requirements of best practices in a
new era, both subsume the nature of electronic records in part, (and perhaps in favor) of the
archivists’ ability to ensure evidence and authenticity through governance or distributed custody.
29	  

Moreover, since Schellenberg’s landmark appraisal framework, many North American archivists
have focused on the informational content of transmission (how a record informs) as well as a
record’s capacity as evidence (Schellenberg, 1996). If we understood the electronic record to be
an aggregate of physical, conceptual and logical entities, then we could trust diffused control of
electronic records to many actors (records creators, managers, and archivists), and even more it if
such entities reside across many platforms and are supported by networked infrastructure.
Materiality includes the physical form (however atomic the bits), but also extends to the systems,
practice, and social institutions that are built up around artifacts.

Records Continuum Theory and Relationships Between Record Concepts
Increasingly, the transmission and distributed custody of digital collections rely upon the
infrastructure of many platforms (Abreu et al., 2012).11 One significant way to approach the
processes of transmission of electronic records is through the lens of continuum thinking.
Historically attributed to the work of Australian archivist Ian McLean, records continuum theory
has gained increasing traction in archival debates about electronic records since the 1990s
(Upward, 1994). The continuum approach stresses the processes of transactions and the
overlapping character of evidentiality, which is significant for theorizing electronic
recordkeeping environments. As records acquire “ever-broadening layers of contextual
knowledge in order to carry their meanings through time,” conceptualizing a records continuum
allows us to consider the significance of archival interventions as part of a process (McKemmish,
2001, p. 354).

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
11

For the purposes here, platform means (hardware architecture and software framework).

30	  

For continuum theorists, such as Frank Upward and Sue McKemmish, recordkeeping is a
continuum of processes that encapsulates the life cycles of records and their attendant activities.
These activities range from the creation of records, to capture, organization of recordkeeping
processes, and pluralization of records. Taken together, these four dimensions of recordkeeping
establish the evidentiality of context as records move across spacetime, just as they may serve
differently in multiple contexts (Cumming, 2010, p. 42).12 The continuum approach allows
archival scholars to move beyond artificial distinctions from the records life cycle model by
deemphasizing static stages of records. Continuum thinking enables theorizing of multiple
possibilities and future layers of meaning (pluralization).
Continuum scholars have also argued for understanding records as having both logical
and physical properties, while focusing on the logic of processural realities (Upward, 2009a, p.
5). The shifting landscape of digital preservation has given rise to approaches that compliment
the continuum approach.13 For example, Kenneth Thibodeau has proposed a model of preserving
digital objects that moves beyond the traditional understanding of records as physical or
conceptual things.14 He argues for understanding records as logical, physical, and conceptual
objects (Thibodeau, 1997, pp. 7-9). If we approach records as physical objects with a material
history that is represented and moves through information systems, then we can understand their
creation and preservation from the inside out—from abstract to concrete networked
communication realities.

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
12

I employ the concept of spacetime as employed in the records continuum model developed by Frank Upward. As
he has argued, no records can be outside of spacetime, but are subject to it, an archivist’s actions upon records
reverberates through it.
13
New areas include the emerging fields of personal digital archiving, digital duration, and scientific workflow and
provenance documentation.
14
A digital object is an object of any type of information or any format that is expressed in digital forms, and
includes a range of electronic records and their digital traces of transmission.

31	  

For Thibodeau (1997), this is illustrated through relationships among the three properties
of digital objects, however “the relationships between levels must be known or knowable” (p.11,
emphasis added). These relationships between logical, physical and conceptual levels may be
one-to-one or one-to-many. In any case, understanding and describing the relationships between
concepts must be process oriented and understood across a continuum. But these relationships
must also be described at the platform level, in addition to the scales of infrastructures that are
enacted as records are created, used, and preserved.

Framework for Locating Records in Infrastructure
Based upon my review and contemplation of the approaches described above, I propose a
framework that takes into consideration infrastructure, technological practice, and information
retrieval aspects, updating Hedstrom’s research agenda by expanding it to include broadening
layers of infrastructure in ICTs moving between scales of analysis.15 It takes up the logical and
physical aspects of Thibodeau’s digital object model and applies the methodological approach
that Trace has developed in her microethnography of computerized document creation. The
framework relies on the records continuum to map these infrastructures and illustrate dimensions
of recordkeeping in spacetime.
Employing a framework that examines infrastructure, especially at the level of
transmission points to conditions of modernity: including the fluency of infrastructure and the
vulnerability of transactions across electronic recordkeeping environments.16 This proposed
framework enables archival scholars to move between registers of analysis and develop a mutual
orientation towards infrastructural analysis and continuum thinking. The framework aims to

Scales provide the opportunity to move between registers of analysis and levels of infrastructure.
Edwards has examined such infrastructural fluencies and vulnerabilities in "Infrastructure and Modernity.”

illustrate the significance of what can be learned by going into the black box, following records
through infrastructure, and knowing what happens at moments of transmission.

First Element: Layers of Infrastructure and Context
The first element of the framework is concerned with describing the multiple levels of
infrastructure that make records possible in different contexts. Understanding layers of
infrastructure also reveals information about the digital materiality of electronic records in
logical and physical ways.
According to Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star, there are four elements of
infrastructure: when technologies become a part of established routines; soon they are
understood commonly across different communities of practice (as boundary objects); these
technologies become transparent through use; and become embedded into socio-technical
systems (Bowker & Star, 1999). By examining what lies beneath these processes of such
stabilization—the code, standards, network architecture, public policy, and market forces that
make pushing an electronic record from a recorded event to an information object, archivists can
see the layers of context that shape records as they move through spacetime. This approach also
allows us to consider how records are continuously active, always in the process of becoming
entities in a continuum (Upward, 2009a).
Peter Botticelli argues that incorporating such an active view of the record into
organizational contexts gives archival scholars the opportunity to observe the process of
networked recordkeeping. Instead of understanding records as by-products of organizational
transactions (that is, traditional Schellenbergian and Jenkinsonian understandings of records),
Botticelli (2000) suggests that archivists appraise records as a “class of technological artifacts in
33	  

a socio-technical system” (p. 174). Applying the study of infrastructure to records in systems is a
way of examining how the historical context and development of distributed activities are
technologically and socially co-constituted because of the focus on mobility and processing of
information across networks (Bowker, 2010). As the nature of knowledge work changes with
twenty-first century ICTs, it is incumbent upon archivists to understand the shifting contexts and
layers of infrastructure. The method of infrastructure studies explores new forms of sociality that
are being enabled by ICTs and the social, ethical and political values of self-perpetuating
infrastructures (Bowker, 2010, p. 105). I argue that there is a mutual orientation between
infrastructure studies and the records continuum model: both are attuned to the layers of
technologies, practices, and events in different contexts.
In digital environments, records are more malleable and, many argue, more accessible
than they are in analog formats. This raises questions such as: what are the layers of
infrastructure that make the use, access and re-use of electronic records possible? And how do
layers of infrastructure affect the enduring value, authenticity, and integrity of electronic
records? Numerous contemporary archival scholars have pointed to the fact that “the digital”
destabilizes inherited concepts such as original record or the authentic first copy (Bearman,
2007; Duranti 1998; Duranti et al., 2002; Gilliland-Swetland, 2000). However few of these
scholars go beyond this conceptual bind and look at the material history and the social choices
such as standards development or the design of platforms that lie behind that destabilization.
Historians of technology know that many of these givens are the result of a series of choices that
have been made. Each is filled with values that must be located and the influences of those
values taken seriously (Dourish & Bell, 2011). For example, consider systems that delete records
after certain storage limits are reached (e.g. mobile phones and computer operating systems).
34	  

This is a design choice of which archivists, lawyers, and historians should be aware because it
changes our ideas about the history and evidence values of records as well as their data structure
and context.
Sue McKemmish, writing about capturing documentary context in information systems,
has touched upon the problem of complexity and context in electronic environments:
The loss of physicality that occurs when records are captured electronically is forcing
archivists to reassess basic understandings about the nature of the records of social and
organizational activity, and their qualities as evidence. Even when they are captured in a
medium that can be felt and touched, records as conceptual constructs do not coincide
with records as physical objects. Physical ordering and placement of such records
captures a view of their contextual and documentary relationships, but cannot present
multiple views of what is a complex reality. The traditional custodial role takes on
another dimension when it is accepted that the record is only partly manifest in what is in
the boxes on the repository shelves. The purpose of archival systems is to ensure that
records are preserved in the context of their creation and use, and retain their qualities as
evidence so that when retrieved for future use their meaning and significance can be
understood.
(McKemmish, 1994, p. 187)
McKemmish uses the physicality of records (or loss of it) as an entry point to reiterate the
importance of data structure on context of creation, whether that be on the shelf or in the file
structure of an operating system, and how the creator or user experiences that in practice. In
addition to platform design decisions and local memory storage limits, the history of object
oriented data structures, relational databases, even NoSQL (not only structured query language)
35	  

are approaches that do not adhere to relational approaches and affect the realities of archival
objects in different digital environments and their contexts of creation. Further, data structures
can heavily influence the flavors of database populism that may arise and recordkeeping
possibilities with systems such as in social media (Driscoll, 2012).
The data structures that we employ are not only conscious design choices, but also affect
the possibilities for description, retrieval and access in the future. Data structures “infrastructure”
the representation of records in existing systems as well as shape the contexts of their reception
or access. In some cases, the design of the system limits possibilities of creating traces at the
same time as it institutes values. Archivists should examine multiple contexts of record creation,
use and interpretation in different contexts in addition to the creation of metadata during
transmission, but they should also consider how the data structures that infrastructure record
creation shape evidence. This includes considering system design, user experience, and limits of
creating records with a device that involves (to name but a few) an external battery, an operating
system, a Wi-Fi or mobile data connection, limited local storage, and possible cloud back up. In
each of these cases (and beyond) these objects involve layers of infrastructure that have
significant archival implications for preservation, authenticity, and evidence.

Second Element: Examining Networked Recordkeeping
Contemporary recordkeeping practices rely on distributed, networked systems, yet there are very
few descriptions of records transitioning across systems as a process, or how their history of
stabilization (as formats) affects their circulation. This raises a key research question: What do
these processes look like, conceptually, logically, and physically (i.e., “under-the-hood”)?
Archival scholars and practitioners who have worked with electronic records since the 1980s
36	  

agree that there are some crucial “moments of risk” for electronic records throughout their
creation and existence (Bearman, 2006). The moments that present the greatest risks are,
paradoxically, those transactional points when entities cross systems and result in the creation of
records. Furthermore, this is how these transactions, from web publishing, to retrieving
electronic records off hard disks, to accessing online information work. Moments of risk are
points where control is ceded or diminishes over a record at the levels of capture, ingest, and
accession.17 In other words, these are moments of transition across information systems, or when
the record itself is transformed, copied from one user to another or from system to system, or
accessed by one platform from another (Kirschenbaum, 2008).
Conceptually, these threats are understood as areas for archival concern and logically,
they have been theorized for several decades. However, physically, they are not well
documented. Records are seen as fragile and at risk during transmission, instead of being
understood as a fundamental part of how electronic records physically and logically function in
contemporary modes of communication. According to Bearman, the greatest risks are at the level
and capture and access because these two moments are “outside the scope” of most models of
archival preservation. However, the nature and effects of these risks are critical to the archival
perspective, while still seen as beyond the threshold of the archivist’s responsibility in the life
cycle model. Where traditional analog archives ingest records after they become inactive,
electronic records are always active, even as they are accessed as archives. Instead of assuming
that these are innate moments of vulnerability, the proposed framework allows us to ask what if
archivists approached transmission as moments of authority—to locate, understand, and describe
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
17

If a draft, mp3 or a digital photograph is sent, whether through email or transfer from one machine to another with
a USB flash drive, there are a series of junctures that it goes through to move from one (physical) place to another
(at the levels of copy, capture, ingest, access). Users who use networked ICTs to communicate understand the
distributed nature of transmission and failure in a variety of conceptual and logical ways. Further, they create
practices and improvise around these junctures.

37	  

as archival objects of interest? Bearman and other postcustodial scholars argued for examining
process through continuum thinking but what does that mean for networked recordkeeping
environments that include multiple platforms and distributed storage?
Despite the supposed riskiness, Bearman (1994) focuses on the relationships that records
have across systems because it transforms the nature of the information: “[ICTs] are not just
providing a new method for transmission of information but changing the social character of the
communication” (p. 14). Understanding the nature of electronic records as a process of creation
and transmission is a useful conceptual move and can be seen in Bearman’s commitment to the
materiality of electronic records. Bearman was one of the first scholars to raise the importance of
‘the conceptual’ to electronic records theory in the early 1990s, and a decade later he began to
publish about the “material conditions for communication” in twenty-first century computing
environments. He wrote that the most problematic part that makes an electronic record is in its
identification, which then poses some serious, practical problems for managing them:
A record is any communication between one person and another, between a person and a
store of information available to others, back from the store of information to a person or
between two computers programmed to exchange data in the course of business. What is
excluded in this definition is any information that remains within the computer
workspace of a single individual, inaccessible to others, for private information or under
editing and development. When the information is shared with another person or a
machine accessible to others, it becomes a record.
The virtue of this definition is the ease with which individuals can understand it and the
simplicity of instructing computing and communications systems to capture it.
(Bearman, 1993)
38	  

For Bearman, the nature of the electronic record is “the when” of accessibility and sharing in
transmission between systems that signifies a transaction. Or as McKemmish has argued, when a
record crosses boundaries is what defines it (1994).
Crossing boundaries, moving between systems, sharing information, and sending drafts
that become records are all descriptions of records for postcustodial archival scholars, the
explanation relies on transmission to ‘become’ a defined record. Yet it remains unclear why
transmission is not examined as part of this process of becoming a record. I argue that even
postcustodial definitions of electronic records becoming in spacetime overlook material
constraints and employ tropes of immateriality (Blanchette, 2011). Frequently, these tropes rely
on a loss of physicality or a reliance on understanding electronic environments as “purely logical”
constructs without material constraints.18 Despite a reliance on immateriality to explain
transmission, we can credit Bearman for drawing attention to the material conditions of
electronic communication, the physical constructs of recordkeeping systems, and the logical
boundaries of archival principles such as fonds or provenance.
Archival systems produce as much as they record and document and this is dependent on
the context and materiality of the records they hold. As new information technologies shift the
ways of communicating, exchanging, organizing and preserving knowledge, they also transform
the very terms of that knowledge. This second element assumes that the description and deep
understanding of the processes of transmission are viable and essential parts of arriving at
archival understandings regarding distributed records, this also has stakes for our evaluation of

	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
18

Bearman often uses metaphors of immateriality when describing the future of archival principles in electronic
systems, often diametrically opposing them to the past of analog (paper-based) recordkeeping systems: “The ‘fonds’
as a physical construct will completely disappear because the boundaries of recordkeeping systems will be purely
logical ones,” Electronic Evidence, p. 254.

39	  

the materiality of recordkeeping. It prompts archivists to examine networked recordkeeping in
order to locate new and improvised forms and practices of record creators and users.

Third Element: Engaging with Information Retrieval
The rise of digitally-born records and the cheap cost of digital storage present a pressing and
challenging area of information management, it is also an opportunity for archivists to apply
traditional principles to new possibilities for retrieval and access in an era of big data collections
and inquiry. Increasingly it is cheaper (and arguably easier) to save swaths of electronic records
through backup instead of weeding through appraisal and deletion. Claims of the “big data
revolution” have generated significant response in virtually every area of society.19 Big data is
positioned as a potential resource in business, government, academic research, and military
applications, and many information professions are developing analytic tools for retrieval and
enterprise (Borgman, et al., 2007; Lynch, 2008; LaValle et al., 2011). Likewise, academic big
data initiatives in disciplines such physics and astronomy have promised new levels of analytics
and discovery. The ability to capture more data has grown as sensors for collecting data become
smaller and more ubiquitous. Moreover, the cost effectiveness of saving and the ability to re-use
recorded information has led to a paradigm of data intensive science (Borgman, 2007). In an age
of big data, there is potential for archivists to leverage traditional principles like provenance and
archival bond to enhance information retrieval and access (Bearman & Lytle, 1985).
Historically, information retrieval (IR) has been understood as retrieving documents and
sometimes portions of text in order to satisfy a user’s need (Spärck-Jones & Peter Willett, 1997).

40	  

Among the most common is the retrieval of single documents that can be accomplished in two
ways, through indexing by subject or searching by keyword or phrase. Where indexing is
concerned with representations of documents (or information objects), searching refers to the
ways documents are matched to specific queries by unique markers within the body of a
document’s text or internal structure. A great preponderance of early-automated information
retrieval systems that were designed and built in the twentieth century were intended for
retrieving references to surrogates of documents through indexing and abstracting (for example,
union catalogs). Then, with the rise of institutional and personal computing and the decrease in
storage and processing costs there was a shift to full-text retrieval of documents by searching
with key words. Some IR systems, including search engines combine both indexing and
document structure of web based objects (such as web pages) to leverage both approaches. In
both retrieval applications, the design and approach to indexing and searching are obliged to use
the document as the base unit of measure—words, phrases and structures within a given
document were and are the guiding principles of searching for relevant information with
automated retrieval systems. By virtue of privileging the internal structure of the document as
the guiding measure, both IR applications neglect relationships between documents, known as
“intra-document structure” and their context of creation as meaningful information or possible
access points.
While most IR approaches are concerned with retrieving records as single entities,
archivists and records managers are concerned with how records should be collectively managed
in aggregate as opposed to single documents. Records have the most power in aggregate,
according to Schellenberg (1996), because “records have a collective rather than a unitary
significance” (p. 67). Accordingly, for some diplomatic scholars, like Luciana Duranti, it is only
41	  

after a document is set aside and designated to be “put into relation to other records” that it
becomes a record and acquires an archival bond (1997, p. 216). For Duranti, the record and its
archival bond are dependent upon a formal method of setting records aside after transmission for
capture, description, and preservation. Such an orthodox border of designated capture that is
dependent on a recordkeeping system may leave some types of records on the sidelines. Some
scholars have noted that transitory records may escape system safeguards and further, that
systems often intentionally do not capture transitory or secondary records, which may be the
most important metadata in networked contexts (Stuckey, 1995, p. 121; Shepherd & Yeo, 2003,
p. 108-109). Although escaping such a system safeguard may forfeit the diplomatic conceptions
of the archival bond for some stray records, many archivists agree that they are no less important
to the historical record.
From a continuum perspective, the archival bond is a relationship that perdures through
the dimensions of creation, capture, organizing and pluralization. Continuum theorists have
argued that the principle of provenance (often dependent upon a single record creator or fonds)
should be expanded to include the interaction among multiple fonds or creators. Such an
expansion can be seen in Chris Hurley's critique of provenance (Hurley, 2005a; Hurley, 2005b).
In traditional western archival practices, provenance has two distinctions, “records of the same
provenance should not be mixed with those of a different provenance, and the archivist should
maintain the original order in which the records were created and kept (Gilliland-Swetland,
2000). Hurley argues that a single context of provenance denies the possibilities of records
crossing and interacting with multiple fonds and bodies of records (e.g. networked social
platforms or Web 2.0). The concepts of simultaneous multiple provenance and parallel
provenance, for Hurley and others, is a means for archivists to capture the recordkeeping realities
42	  

of distributed digital environments like social networks. As opposed to traditional understandings
of provenance, parallel provenance allows for the archival description of multiple contexts of
creation, records creators, and individual fonds to exist as a part of the co-creation or
convergence of collections. When applied to archival description, parallel provenance offers a
way to account for the networked nature of platforms by expanding the possibilities for
description, and in turn it enables dynamic retrieval that traditional IR approaches cannot
accomplish.
By leveraging the principles of multiple simultaneous and parallel provenance and
archival bond to expand description, archivists are in a unique position to locate and interpret
evidence of records in the aggregate and as collections of value in information retrieval
approaches. Retrieval through provenancial information and valuing the power of connective
tissue across records in data structures, enables archivists to locate and thus support emerging
recordkeeping contexts in ways that traditional and most current IR approaches overlook. The
implications of online retrieval for archivists lie in the context of a record’s formation,
interaction among fonds, and parallel provenance in collections. Each can be used as access
points in retrieval (Lytle, 1980).
Despite such significance, there is still little understood about the implications for
archival retrieval with large-scale digital record corpora. In 1985, Richard Lytle and David
Bearman claimed that archivists’ “unique perspective” provided by the principle of provenance
would be their contribution to the future of information management in the digital records era
(Bearman & Lytle, 1985). Lytle and Bearman predicted that automated information systems
would greatly benefit from provenance-based retrieval and identified design factors and guiding
principles for empirical research. Retrieving archival evidence through description and access by
43	  

searching across relationships between networked records is still under-explored for professional
archivists and the communities they serve. Increasingly, the ways in which “provenance” is
incorporated in contemporary system architecture do not employ provenance as understood by
archivists. Instead, it stands in for workflow processes in an organization or distributed work
group (Moreau, 2006).
Information retrieval systems are designed according to the standards and conventions of
the institutional networks in which they operate. As archives increasingly ingest electronic
records they will need to confront new ways of organizing and providing access to their
collections. There is evidence that data scientists grappling with databases and massive amounts
of data are on the forefront of the conceptual and technical retrieval problems of document
structure, workflow, and what many scientists who work with big data are increasingly calling
“provenance” (Moreau, 2007). The dearth of work in archival scholarship that is looking ahead
to these retrieval issues is both a poison and a cure. Identifying places outside of archives where
provenance and multiple contexts are seriously considered is one step towards building a
meaningful hermeneutic, or guiding interpretative principle, for the future of automated retrieval
systems that embed archival infrastructure into the design and implementation.
This third element in the framework, therefore, emphasizes the archival approach to
groups of records, interaction among fonds, and evidence that the archival bond affords and that
many current information retrieval approaches neglect. In the next section I present the case
study of Kurt Mix to illustrate the applicability of the framework for encouraging archival
scholars to expand their inquiry into scales infrastructure and electronic records’ boundary
crossing through the continuum. The case points to the problems that arise as information is
shared and distributed between people across systems and the multiplicity of archival conflicts
44	  

that can arise in connection with emerging records practices using mobile, networked
communication.

Kurt Mix and the BP Oil Disaster
On 20 April 2010, the Deepwater Horizon mobile offshore drilling rig exploded off the southeast
coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. The explosion killed 11 people and injured 17 more rig
workers. The Deepwater Horizon rig burned and sank causing the Macondo oil well to blow out.
The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, also know as the ‘BP Oil Disaster’, is the largest marine oil
spill in the history of the petroleum industry. The oil well leaked unabated for three months as
British Petroleum (BP) attempted several times to cap off the blown well using different
methods. BP and the US government initially underestimated how much oil spilled during the
crisis, now estimated at 205.8 million gallons.20
A month after trying to stop the spill on 26 May 2010, BP announced a project called
“Top Kill” to drill mud at a high pressure into the broken well. Kurt Mix, a BP drilling project
engineer was on a team that used models to approximate the flow of the blowout as part of
preparation for Top Kill. For two days Mix reported progress back to his supervisor regarding
the progress of Top Kill using his mobile phone. He exchanged approximately 200 text messages
with his supervisor in a text thread (a thread is a series of text messages exchanged between
users) sharing estimates of the flowrate. Later Mix used text messaging to discuss the project
with another BP contractor. Three days later, on 29 May 2010, BP announced that Top Kill had
failed and that they were exploring other contingency options. In October 2010, Mix deleted the
thread of text messages with his supervisor. In August of the following year, he deleted another

thread of communications between him and another contractor. Mix deleted approximately 300
text messages related to Top Kill from his iPhone in total, comprising two text threads between
him and two other BP employees.
Two years after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, in April 2012, the first criminal
charges associated with the BP oil disaster were filed against Kurt Mix for obstructing justice by
destroying evidence related to the actual amount of oil leaking from the blowout.21 Throughout
the spill, BP released flow estimates that were later found to be several times lower than the
actual amount spilling from the Macondo well. The U.S. Justice Department alleges that the text
messages that Mix sent and received contain information related to the actual flowrate of oil
during the spill, contrary to the information that BP reported to the government, media and the
public during the time of the disaster. Court documents allege that Mix deleted the text threads
after learning that a vendor working for BP’s outside counsel would be imaging his mobile
phone. According to these charges,
there is probable cause to believe that (1) on or about October 4, 2010, and (2) again
between on or about August 19, 2011 and August 20, 2011, Mix did knowingly and
corruptly alter, destroy, mutilate, and conceal a record, document, or other object, and
attempted to do so, with the intent to impair the object’s integrity and availability for use
in an official proceeding, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(1).

Digital forensic analysis was able to recover some of the texts deleted from Mix’s phone but not
all of the texts he received. The complete exchanges were recovered from other devices through
forensic discovery.22
The threads of text messages that Mix allegedly deleted present a case study through
which to read records moving through infrastructure, to examine emerging records practice with
material constraints, and to consider the implications for information retrieval in archival
contexts. Mix is not being charged for the content of the text messages, but instead for deleting
threads of texts from the local storage on his mobile phone with the intent to hide or obscure
information. The evidence of obstruction is located in the metadata and transmission data about
the texts and in the practice of managing them, or in this case deleting text threads. The text
thread itself is consequential because it is both evidence of a read receipt from his coworker’s
devices, and confirmation of multiple text transmissions over a given period of time. The thread
also indicates that there are digital traces of the conversation on multiple telecommunication
servers, message centers that store and forward text messages, possibly hosted by multiple
network providers, as well as on the devices belonging to the people who texted with Mix. The
text thread as a physical, logical and conceptual entity exists in many different places and times,
and there are records of transmission that prove this (e.g., timestamps, billing statements,
messaging application logs). Indeed, such charges of obstruction stand against Mix because these
traces do exist in many places—on the supervisor’s phone, the vendor’s image backup service,
BP’s discovery files as part of legal proceedings, AT&T’s servers (for a time the only U.S.

In legal investigations, forensic discovery is used to recover electronic evidence to support or disprove claims in a
court of law or in civil proceedings. Luciana Duranti has written about the future of digital forensics to archival
practice in “From Digital Diplomatics to Digital Records Forensics,” Archivaria 68 (2010): 39-66.

network provider with iPhone devices and coverage), and perhaps even Mix’s MobileMe
account.23
The charges against Mix speak to each element of the framework that I have proposed.
We can consider the infrastructure that makes the text messages possible—the large scale
technical telecommunication networks that send and transmit the text messages, as well as the
metadata, or the records of transmission that prove such texts where sent and received between
the BP employees. The mobile phone practices of Mix himself also have archival consequences:
What is at stake when we use personal mobile devices to send business messages to supervisors
or collaborators? Who is responsible for documenting and preserving business transactions that
occur with (almost) real-time text messages during federal emergencies or ecological disasters
like the BP Oil Spill? And further, as the Justice Department charges against Mix illustrate, the
evidence of obstruction is not the content of the texts themselves, but instead the intent to
obscure or destroy the evidence between communications—the texts in aggregate as a thread.
The retrieval implications are not in the words used within the text messages, but instead in the
structure of the records as aggregates, or the thread as a collection of records. The transmission
processes are crucial in addition to their timeliness, for example, consider if Mix and his
supervisor were in limited service ranges and texts were delayed or lost during the disaster. The
original order and provenancial information in the case of Mix is as important to the first
criminal charges filed against BP as it is to the archivists who will document the largest spill in
the history of oil disasters.

When is the future? Or, how soon is now?
Given that text messaging has increasingly become a part of the modality of documentation in
modern life, archivists need mechanisms to understand how mobile communication like text
messages exist physically and conceptually, and how the technology will reach closure and
stabilization through social construction (Pinch & Bijker, 1987). Most archival scholars would
approach this documentation quagmire by asking what is a record in terms of text messaging as a
records creation practice, however the digital traces of the thread’s transmissions may well be
more consequential than the content of the texts themselves, as, for example, at the time of Mix’s
trial. What is a record on Mix’s mobile device now, is different from what it was in Spring 2011,
and it is still becoming, acquiring layers of context as it moves through infrastructure both
technological and socially. Moreover, the infrastructure that makes mobile communication
possible will change over time.
Digital traces such as text messages evade many definitions of stable and fixed electronic
records with enduring value (Latour, 2007). However, digital traces should be important to
archivists because archival theories about evidence can intervene upon ontological questions of
how these traces will be enrolled in regimes of evidence in forensics, digital preservation and
jurisprudence in the twenty-first century. As in the unfolding story of Kurt Mix, or other high
profile litigation and civil suites that involve electronic communication, or the presidential
records act that has expanded to include emails and phone.
Historically, archival scholars have been concerned with materiality and have developed
highly faceted ways for interpreting context in and through the materiality of records (e.g.
conservation science, diplomatics, and descriptive bibliography). By reinserting the concern for
materiality into electronic records discourse as it relates to the digital preservation and
49	  

description of layered digital traces that are networked and wirelessly transmitted, archivists
have the opportunity to revisit the importance of the materiality of information to the field of
information science as wider discipline.
As I have written earlier, Gilliland asserts archival scholarship in the 1990s focused upon
the nature of the record; concepts were defined and redefined as archivists confronted the
impacts of computing on ICTs. In 1997, Peter Marsden identified this same trend in archival
scholarship of electronic networked environments, where commentators would proffer
predictions for how archivists should prepare for future technology and information systems. He
wrote,
One witnesses a constant redefinition of terms and the appropriation of others, all of
which leaves a sense that whatever archival footings remain, they are on very unstable
ground. For most archivists, however, the need is neither to attack the past nor to resist
the future.
(Marsden, 1997, p. 158.)
There is a pervasive commitment to defining the record in electronic environments that has
existed in archival scholarship since the 1980s. A remnant of positivist orthodoxy, the
commitment dictates we must redefine, “What is a record?” each time a new electronic record,
platform, or information object is encountered. Although practitioners, as Marsden points out,
simply need some guidance that does not create disjunction between now and the future, I argue
that many archival scholars are fixated on coming to universal understandings and applications
of ‘what a record is’ in the diplomatic sense and have been slow to find universal, catholic
approaches that include all information objects of evidential value, and multiple contexts of
records-becoming. We must open the scope of our inquiry to the layers of infrastructure,
50	  

networked recordkeeping practice and the possibilities for archival retrieval within the records
continuum. By incorporating spacetime, and scales of infrastructure to our analysis we can arrive
at a fuller understanding of electronic records, but also the expansion of archival callings.24

Always becoming, or, when is a record?
The project of defining a record should be abandoned in the age of networked records. Instead
we must expand our focus to the ever-broadening layers of infrastructure and context through
which digital records move. As we have seen with text messages, in the digital age the
ontological purity and drive for the true nature of the record is over. It cannot be located because
it is not in a single place, it never ends, and is “always in a process of becoming” in the
continuum (McKemmish, 1994, p. 187). Instead, a record’s mediation through time and space,
its mobility and perdurance as archival infrastructure are the ultimate factors in determining
enduring value. Analyzing how a record moves through networks, and asking when a record is
becoming, and how and where it persists is a more productive method for understanding effects
of infrastructure and ultimately how electronic evidence is socially constituted with technologies.
The nature of the electronic record that is wirelessly transmitted across networks, platforms, and
information systems cuts through the inertia of the tired defining exercise: the very basis of the
digital is its flexibility, unfixity, combinations and recombinations.
Instead of asking, “what is a record?” when we encounter new information communication
technologies, it behooves archival scholars instead to ask, “when is a record in infrastructure?”
How can we account for the processes of creation, transmission, storage and retrieval that occur

Richard J. Cox has described part of these new archival callings as educating and informing “citizen archivists” in
Personal Archives and a New Archival Calling: Readings, Reflections and Ruminations (Duluth, MN: Litwin
Books, LLC, 2008), pp. 23-24.

throughout the continuum? Tracing evidence through infrastructure proves to be a way to get at
record-ness without getting caught up in the rigmarole of asking what a record should be or how
it is complete every time archivists and records managers encounter ‘new’ digital traces and
unknown systems, from new platforms, to emergent ways of communicating with new formats.
Marsden pointed to a sense of “unstable ground” that kept archival scholars from resisting the
future. Fifteen years later, we are still encountering unstable ground with digital landscapes. But
what has been overlooked are the layers of infrastructure and large-scale technical networks that
really have hardened and stabilized around emerging recordkeeping practices in networks that
create a constant sense of instability for archivists.
An updated framework of archival scholarship that accounts for this unsteady terrain and
the multiple ontologies of recordkeeping practice is needed for digital records scholarship.
Continuum scholars have begun this work in modeling spacetime, parallel provenance and
recordkeeping in the continuum, still, infrastructure often remains invisible. Moreover, such a
framework must account for infrastructure from an archival perspective. Archivists can also
locate new possibilities where such a framework can be applied. The framework I have proposed
pushes back upon the conception of information and electronic records as abstract and
immaterial. Furthermore, it prompts a critical challenge to recover the material-ness of things
like digital traces, by examining the infrastructure, technical architecture, code and standards that
shape our ability to migrate the digital landscape in addition to continuum thinking about
recordkeeping.
Archivists also face a pervasive trend information science that deemphasizes the genre
and form of electronic records. Matthew Kirschenbaum calls this the “tactile fallacy,” arguing
that electronic information’s lack of tangibility does not negate form and physical qualities
52	  

(2002, p. 43). In addition to overcoming a reliance on immateriality to explain digital forms, we
need to describe new ways of being in the world that are supported by electronic records. Many
archival scholars take contemporary recordkeeping practices as objects of study. But emerging
social practices around records in networks and social platforms such as the law, digital forensics
and telecommunication policy remain ripe for analysis. Presently, archivists do not have a
method for understanding the stabilization of emerging formats over time, how they are created
or used.25 By studying the conditions of possibility for things to exist, at moments of creation and
then over time, examining the historical ontology of records within infrastructure provides a
means of analyzing epistemological transformations, emerging categories of knowledge, and
techniques of inscription (Ribes & Polk, 2012).

The Future of Digital Communication
There are whole swaths of records created with personal communication devices (ranging from
digital cameras, to media players, to tablets and so on) that are not and will not be documented
by historical collecting institutions like libraries, archives and museums. Instead emerging
documentation will be fixed by individuals and survive on networks, what we are now calling
personal digital archives. Presently we use our mobile phones as primary communication
devices. There are more than 6 billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide, and texting with
mobile phones is now the most popular form of daily communication (Noah, 2012). We use
these mobile devices to communicate in a variety of ways beyond voice traffic—we send
messages, access the Internet, contact friends, family and co-workers, take photographs, and use
them for location services.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
25

For example, we can trace the historical ontology of blogs (and their comments), from personal weblogs or
commentary published online to established, structured forms that are now seen as primary sources.

53	  

In a relatively short time, mobile computing with handsets has become the primary way
of communicating information in terms of volume, frequency and penetration throughout the
world. Clearly, archivists must account for emerging electronic formats such as mobile records,
however it is uncertain that existing approaches to electronic records can account for the
complexities of today’s digital infrastructure. Consequently, archivists face a challenge to update
and expand their methods for both understanding and managing such records. This is a daunting
task as multiple devices, new formats, operating systems, service providers, local storage and
cloud backup, mobile applications, and shifting legal landscapes keep many records managers
and archival scholars from seriously considering the future of mobile communication or personal
archives in archival institutions. Each aspect adds layers of context, links in multiple chains of
custody, and distributed provenancial information to the continuum. The significance of this
framework addresses the challenge of complex systems, the invisibility of infrastructure and the
shifting responsibilities of the archivist in the digital age. Heather MacNeil (2001) writes that
there needs to be a “more equitable balance between the product and the process of documentary
creation and transmission.” Given the possibilities of emerging digital traces in contemporary
society, it is time for archivists to consider how infrastructure supports and shapes record
creation and transmission and is mutually oriented towards continuum models. In order to more
fully understand the archival realities we need to understand the processes of communication in
the continuum, the practices of communicating as well as the traces that are generated, produced,
and exchanged as part of a trail of evidence that bonds the data, texts, pictures, and tweets that
have been sent and transmitted across systems. Studying how and when records move along
infrastructure, in networked practice, and through retrieval contexts will give archivists a
renewed opportunity to examine the new physical realities of our work with material traces in
54	  

new forms and new spaces in the postcustodial era. It may be a daunting task, but if I am right
that locating records within complex scales of infrastructure provides archivists with a renewed
calling to examine the possibilities of transmission within the continuum, then we must attempt
to try.

Chapter 3: Infrastructure, Standards and Innovation of the Short Message Service

Abstract: The Short Message Service (SMS) is a teleservice that was developed by the Global
System for Mobile Communication in the mid-1980s for second-generation mobile networks.
SMS is made up of standards, protocols and infrastructure that make text messaging the most
popular data service on mobile networks. The teleservice has since been used in all subsequent
generations of digital cellular mobile telephony. This chapter discusses the development of the
SMS teleservice standards (GSM 03.40), how it has influenced mobile telephony infrastructure,
and how it remains a lasting communication innovation today. It historicizes text messaging
standards and their technical realization by describing the network architecture and elements
required for the transmission of SMS. This chapter focuses on illustrating how SMS standards
and infrastructure represent a significant innovation to mobile telephony and how they have
figured in the history of wireless data transmission in the late twentieth century.

What are Text Messages?
Six billion text messages are sent and received every day around the world (CTIA 2013).
Presently, text messaging with mobile phones is the most widely used teleservice on mobile data
networks. The Short Message Service (SMS) that makes text messaging possible is a confluence
of protocols, standards, design and infrastructure that has existed for more than two decades.
Despite its influence, SMS is still known as one of the simplest innovations of second generation
mobile telephony and very little has been written about the history of its development (Brown et
al. 2007, Goggin 2005).
Text messages are short alphanumeric communications sent from one mobile phone user
to another with messaging applications on mobile handsets (also known as cell phones, mobiles,
or handyphones). They are frequently used for social coordination because text messages are
quick and cheap to send. Moreover, they have enabled a culture of abbreviated communication,
known as a texting argot or “txt talk” (Kasesniemi 2003, Vincent 2006). When cellular networks
were first being conceived in the late 1980s, a large portion of the telecommunications industry
in Europe and the United States predicted that circuit switched data services would be the most
important mobile applications for individual end users after voice calls. During the initial
development of teleservice standards for pan-European mobile telephony (ETSI 1992), SMS was
seen as an add-on without much potential for commercial significance. Facsimile, Videotex, and
other data format transmission appeared to be more lucrative. But within a decade of its
introduction, the text message teleservice would soon be the fastest growing teleservice. The
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates that there are as many mobile handsets
are there are people in the world and that penetration is quickly reaching 100% (ITU, 2013).
69	  

More than 77% of the world population SMS text messaging at least once a year--it is the most
popular teleservice today measured by sheer volume of transmission and market share (Dudley
2013). Most mobile subscribers send and receive text messages several times a month, some
(especially adolescents) as many as hundreds a day (Quadrello et al. 2005, Smith 2011).
While mobile telephony has significantly influenced personal communication in the
twentieth century, few teleservices have influenced communication and wireless data
transmission more than text messaging. The ability to send and receive text messages shapes
many things that we do with our mobile phones and our expectations of mobile network services.
SMS effects a range of networked applications, from point-to-point messages, to social
networking with micro-blogging platforms (Oulasvirta et al. 2010), to mobile banking (Barnes et
al. 2003), to crisis management and emergency aid services (Gomez et al. 2011). Once a user
sends an SMS, they are handled by network operated message service centers that aggregate
messages and connect to carrier operator databases to transmit messages to the devices of
intended recipients. If the recipient is not within a user’s home network, operators forward the
message to another carrier’s service centers for handoff. In order for this information and
communication technology (ICT) to work it must be interoperable, modular, and flexible. These
qualities are achieved through standards. Standards and standardization make mobile telephony
and the large-scale technical architecture of wireless data transmission possible.
The history and development of SMS standards, network architecture and protocol
govern how mobile data is transmitted across networks today. It can also be attributed for the
uptake of other services such as picture messages (Multimedia Messaging Service),
microblogging and social location services with SMS integration like Twitter. These
developments also shape how users experience infrastructure such as network coverage and other
70	  

applications, like SMS gateways to the Internet. This infrastructure also shapes the evidence of
transactions that is created by the transmission of text messages. Though SMS has a variety of
applications, personal text messaging between users remains one of the most popular uses of
mobile phones.
This chapter seeks to answer the questions: What makes the SMS teleservice possible?
What makes text messaging common in our everyday lives? And moreover, how has it become a
universal format for mobile communication? While many social scientists have examined the
motivations of why people text—from activism, to flirting and breaking up, to communicating
with employers, there is little research that has examined the history and significance of SMS
standards protocol in our daily lives (Ito et al., 2005; Katz & Aakhus, 2005). This chapter
examines three factors that make SMS possible: avenues for consensus needed for standards
development, the modularity of standardization through phases of introduction or “roll-outs”,
and the innovation of the SMS format and the short message service center introduced into
mobile network architecture of the GSM. Each of these factors speaks to the success of SMS as a
wide-reaching teleservice and form of written communication made possible by standards and
standardization work. I argue that these factors are possible because a modern, organized
standards body made a series of decisions built upon a consensus framework that contributed to
the universal success of text messages.
To study SMS infrastructure, I employ the method of information infrastructure studies.
The second section discusses the significance of infrastructure studies to histories of networking
such as second generation mobile telephony. The early landscape of telecommunication
standards, radio services, and first generation mobile communication are presented in the third
section. The fourth section discusses the development of the GSM and the significance of its
71	  

Memorandum of Understanding to standards development and a consensus framework. The fifth
section discusses significant parts of the SMS standard (GSM 03.40), the basic network
architecture of the GSM, and the features that make SMS an innovation (both as a product and
process) in the history of mobile telephony. The final section argues that examining the
development of the standardization and standards introduction phases of the GSM is integral to
the history of mobile information infrastructure because of their significant impact on the uptake
and development of mobile teleservices that transmit data wirelessly.

Information Infrastructure Studies
The GSM standards, subsequent technical mobile networks, and related public policy are all
examples of infrastructure. Taken together they make up large-scale information infrastructures
that made mobile communication possible in the 1990s through to the present-day. Infrastructure
is made up of the devices, standards, technical architecture and network elements that make ICTs
work. This includes the global information and communication technologies that transmit
information across national and regional boundaries (Bowker et al., 2010, p. 98). Distributed
mobile communication practices, such as texting or using Twitter are built up around
infrastructures, and in turn are influenced or “structured” by the infrastructure that enable such
practices. Many communication and information scholars have pointed to the fact that new
infrastructure is bootstrapped to existing or earlier forms (Bowker & Star, 2000). Often,
standards and infrastructure are bootstrapped to other complementing, sometimes competing, or
historical infrastructures.
Recent histories of mobile communication infrastructure focus upon mobility—or the
wireless transmission of data while a user or device is moving in a network of coverage (Farman,
72	  

2012; Mackenzie, 2010). Instead of fixed point-to-point communication that the telegraph or
analog telephones afforded, mobile networks allow users to receive messages or calls wherever
data can be transmitted to cells through network coverage. The text messaging teleservice is
made possible by such networked wireless data transmission. When cellular networks were being
conceived in the 1960s and first technically created in the 1970s and 1980s, the mobile
telecommunications industry in Europe and the United States predicted that circuit switched data
would be the most important mobile applications for end users, instead, teleservices that
provided packet-switched data transmission became more popular over time. During the initial
conception of teleservices in the mid-1980s, SMS was seen as a unique, add-on without much
potential for commercial significance. While Facsimile and Videotext transmission, as well as
other data transmissions formats like Mobitex appeared to be more lucrative teleservices
(Hillebrand et al., 2010). Telecomm operators imagined that these data transmission formats
which already had been standardized and in use would be bootstrapped into mobile telephony
standards and carried over into mobile communication. But within a decade of its introduction,
the text message teleservice would outpace these other forms of data transmission and be the
most popular teleservice used with mobile phones (it continues to be the highest earning
teleservice today). Originally conceived as part of the GSM standardization of second generation
digital cellular radio, it became a true innovation that is unique to the history mobile telephony.

The Impact of Standards on Mobile Communication
Standards and standardization development are cultural practices that influence and shape
how our society communicates and creates culture. From public transportation systems, to the
ways that books are shelved in libraries, these practices rely on standards and their development
73	  

over time. They have specific histories with politics, economics, technologies, and ethics.
However, as many infrastructure scholars have noted, the power of standards is in their ubiquity
and invisibility (Star, 1999). Often, the significance of standards and standardization cannot be
seen until something breaks down or becomes inoperable. Researchers and historians who
examine ICT standards show that these hidden standards structure our experiences, they “shape
not only the physical world around us but our social lives and our even our very selves” (Busch,
2011, p. 2). Our experiences of large-scale technical infrastructures structure our lives in a
variety of ways, in many hundreds of ways each day, and these are all based on decisions created
by standards development (Dourish & Bell, 2007). Standards represent consensus, reliability and
repeatability over time and place. Wireless communication such as text messaging, just like
library cataloging or bus route networks, relies upon groups of organized people (private and
public actors) to agree to rules, regulation and modularity (Russell, 2006a). Often the very
important work of consensus building is overlooked and under-examined in histories of
standardization of information and communication technologies.
Because standards structure our experience of telecommunication, histories of their
development, infrastructure, and economic possibilities are important for telecommunication and
mobile communication research. Infrastructure studies aims to do this by contributing to a
comprehensive historical understanding of the development of things, practices, and cultures
through information infrastructure, including the development of standards. Information
infrastructure studies examine large-scale ICT infrastructures ranging from cyberinfrastructure
(Borgman, 2003), the Internet (Bowker et al., 2010) to satellite networks (Parks, 2005) to show
how these infrastructures influence our lives and our shaped by cultures of practice, including
governance, consumption, and the circulation of knowledge. Information infrastructure studies
74	  

emerged in the 1990s in an effort to historicize and analyze cyberinfrastructure, the Internet, and
large scale networks and the groups of people that use and communicate through them, such as
scholarly communities. A variety of scholars from history of technology, science and technology
studies and information science have coalesced around a variety of descriptive large scale
examples of infrastructure and expert or professional communities (Edwards, 1996; Lee et al.,
2006; Traweek, 1992). Infrastructure studies allows us to examine the nexus of “histories of
networking” as Andrew Russell has argued between Internet protocol development and
telecommunications in the late twentieth century (2012). Histories of networking infrastructures
bring into relief how telecommunication policy, standards and international cooperation changed
and the landscape of mobile communication today.
The transmission of text messages and texting as communication practices are distributed
activities. The SMS format carries a history of competing telecommunication standards and
operational constraints from technology, including older media, as well as carrying references to
ancillary mediums and devices, such as instant messaging, pagers, and portable media players,
even telegraph architecture (Winston, 1998). Infrastructure studies serves as a model for
addressing the multiple layers of context involved in distributed mobile communication activities
and how they are developed and built over time. I use the interpretive method of information
infrastructure studies that relies on primary sources such as standards, code and policy to create
an analysis of infrastructure for phases of GSM standards development. Later in the chapter, I
present the SMS format, known as the transfer protocol data unit, as an entry point. Examining
stabilization and transmission of the text message is way of looking beneath the format at the
layers of history and development of standards and mobile communication infrastructure (Sterne,
2012). By examining the social, ethical, and political value of mobile telephony standards and
75	  

infrastructures, as well as the changes in the nature of distributed knowledge work, we can
account for limits and affordances in different contexts and formations (Bowker, et al 2010, p.
105). Stories of innovations and standards, are not always smooth or sequential however
(Millerand et al., 2013), and it is worth examining how and why text messages succeeded as the
data transmission of choice over a variety of other teleservices as well as earlier generations of
mobile telephony that were developed to transmit textual information and did not succeed.

Historical Background to Mobile Telephony
Before SMS as an innovation can be adequately described and historicized, some brief
background about mobile communication infrastructure should be covered. I begin by discussing
the history of wireless textual communication messages beginning with wireless telegraphy,
Telex and Teletype, and pagers. I then present an introduction to first generation mobile
telephony in the US, UK and Scandinavia. Then, the chapter addresses the significance of the
establishment of the GSM Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) between countries,
telecommunication providers, handset and equipment manufacturers, and network operators as a
driving force for innovation and the uptake of SMS as part of a consensus. Infrastructure and
standards development are brought to the fore as an influential part of the success of the SMS
innovation.

Early radio teleservices
There were a variety of early technologies, including radio and short cell mobile services that
transmitted data and voice information before the rise of mobile phones. Arguably, radio
telegraphy from the nineteenth century is the earliest form of transmitted textual messages
76	  

through circuit-switched networks. Despite the fact that many people believe that mobile phones
mark the beginning of truly ‘mobile’ communication, media historians argue that wireless
telegraphy figures in heavily to the history and conception of mobile communication and data
transmission at the turn of the early nineteenth century (Carey, 1989; Marvin, 1988; Wythoff,
2013). Telegraphy infrastructure predates the cellular idea of transmitting data across mobile
networks by many decades (Agar, 2013), however Wythoff has argued (2013) that as early as the
1890s hobbyists and telegraph enthusiasts were imagining pocket wireless transmissions as an
early form of mobile communication. Station-to-station Morse telegraphy, both wired and
wireless are the origins of “modern technical texting communications” according to Friedhelm
Hillebrand, the chairman of the non-voice teleservices committee of the GSM (2010, p.1). The
difference between wireless textual communication over radio in the nineteenth century and the
late twentieth century is the support of network architectures. Networks allow information to be
transmitted through nodes, routed to a variety of nodes instead of station by station.
While telegraphy was used throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is the
modern antecedent to text through Telex and Teletype, a more recent technology is often pointed
to as a successor teleservice to SMS. Early GSM commercials marketed the ability to use mobile
phones anywhere and suggested that SMS service would be a “mirror image of paging” (Taylor
& Vincent 2005, p 79). Pagers and paging services are seen as an early touchstone of
transmitting alphanumeric short messages, especially in terms of market penetration, price points
and coverage for consumers in the modern sense. Paging services allowed users to receive
notification that a voice mail was waiting at a phone bank, and later pagers were allowed to
receive messages of numbers to call back. Users later created codes and shorthand practices such
as “hello” by inputting 0-7-7-3-4 and reading the code on the device upside down (Kushner
77	  

1999). By the late 1990s, pagers were seen a primary communications accessory for the business
class in the US and Europe.
Before paging services there were other forms of limited wireless textual transmission
with a long history of analog development used in business, financial and military
communication systems. During the 1970s and 1980s, dedicated radio networks were also
developed. Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) in the UK and Land Mobile Radio (LMR) in the
US were used in enterprise systems and by organizations that needed dedicated radio networks
for short-wave communication such as military, emergency services and the police. In response
to pagers and PMR and LMR networks, the telecommunications industry foresaw the need for
mid-sized mobile networks for consumers beyond business, military and policy service
applications. In the first generation of mobile telephony, the mobile communications landscape
of standards and technologies in the world was varied and uneven, coverage was unreliable
because of the patchwork of telecomm monopolies and national boundaries.

Telex, Teletex
Despite its more recent roots in pagers and paging systems, other textual transmission incunabula
reach back to the telegraph era that have mostly become obsolete have influenced the history and
development of the SMS. Early radio textual communication includes Telex, Teletex, Facsimile,
and Mobitex. Telex, and many other textual transmission tools coordinated teleprinters
connected to a switched analog networks such as telephone networks (Easterlin, 1962).
Teleprinters were used to transmit data in business and financial organizations. The Telex
network and standards were developed by the International Telecommunication Union and as the

78	  

first system to use standardized signaling for international communication of text-based records
(ITU, 1988).
Hillebrand argues that the Telex service is the “forefather” of SMS as it was limited to 50
bits per second and there was a premium on the length of messages sent because of cost of
transmission (Hillebrand, 2010, p. 3). It is also a good example for the conception of
standardization of a data connection for systems across large-scale international networks.
Teletex was standardized to overcome the limits of Telex, and most importantly both Teletex and
Telex used networked architecture to store and forward information which would be used in
future SMS network architecture.
Many of the standards and protocols developed in the early phases of GSM reproduced
teleservices that already existed as part of analog systems or plain old telephone system (POTS)
infrastructure. However the SMS teleservice represented an innovation: the confluence of two
data services that were already seen with pagers and teletext, but connecting them together with a
mobile device and network coverage created a completely new teleservice as well as a new form
of communication and wireless data transmission. It was not immediately identified as an
innovation because of the shadow of mobile voice services and other teleservices initially
designed for GSM 02.03 Teleservices supported by GSM for Public Land Mobile Networks
(ETSI, 1992).

First Generation Mobile Telephony
Early radio communications services were station to station but did not have the handoff
capability that many nodes or cells as network architecture does. Network based communication
services use nodes, such as cell towers and base stations, to pass on information and enable a
79	  

portability that does not rely on connected to a pre-fixed end point to transmit data or voice calls.
However, in the late 1970s, the first mobile networks were still seen as extensions of fixed
networks or landlines. The idea that a network structure would support telephony is rather new to
the history of telecommunication. While these technologies used to transmit data, they were not
built with networked architecture, instead they are largely built on station-to-station
infrastructure, instead of cell broadcast or networked service.
The idea of cellular architecture for mobile transmission was created in the US in the
1940s but the technology did not take shape until the 1960s at Bell labs (Agar, 2003). In the late
1970s the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) was introduced in the US. While the
technology to send and receive mobile calls was technically feasible, regulation and competition
monopoly in the telecommunications industry left standardization to the open market. Competing
mobile standards and FCC regulation kept AMPS from becoming a leading analog mobile phone
standard in advance of other digital cellular radio standards outside of the US.
With first generation mobile telephony, telephony and radio were combined for analog
transmission. Despite a variety of incompatible standards and limited frequency bandwidth, first
generation analog mobile communication was available across Europe within different regions
by the early 1980s: Nordic Mobile Telephony (NMT) in Scandinavia, Total Access
Communication System (TACS) in the UK (similar to AMPS), and C-Net in Germany (Dupuis,
1995; Agar, 2003). The Nordic countries of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland would see
the first regional mobile telephony standards implementation that crossed national boundaries by
January 1980, eventually using two different frequencies NMT-450 and NMT-900. By 1985 it
was the largest first generation mobile analog network, and in many ways the NMT consensus
model was the foundation for the GSM’s Memorandum of Understanding. NMT specifications
80	  

were finalized between 1975 and 1978 (McKelvey et al., 1998). Though standardization of NMT
had began in 1970 and took 10 years to stabilize and implement the standards across the
network. Coincidentally though, the first implementation of the NMT standard happened in
Saudi Arabia in August 1980 (Edquist, 2002).
The history and development of NMT standards and implementation across the Nordic
countries in the 1970s proved that first generation mobile telephony and standards development
could succeed across national boundaries through consensus development.
The pan-European approach to cooperation in the GSM during the following decade after the
introduction of NMT speaks to the historical significance of consensus and competition in
standardization development. The next section provides an introduction to the history and
development of the GSM, which was the first standards protocol for digital cellular radio mobile
networks and is seen as the leading, great success of mobile telecommunications industry of the
1990s.

History of the GSM and the Memorandum of Understanding
In 1982 the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)
created a working group to address the future of digital cellular mobile radio communications.
This working group, called Groupe Spécial Mobile (later named Global System for Mobile
Communications) was charged with developing specifications and standards for a pan-European
digital mobile radio, and supporting digital equipment (Taylor & Vincent, 2005, p. 77). Initially,
CEPT used consensus voting to create standards, but could not enforce standards compliance
from operators, the working group could only recommend that manufacturers,
telecommunication operators and participating nations make use of them (Edquist, 2002, p. 93).
81	  

Deregulation in telecommunications in the late 1980s brought remarkable changes to
standards development: European standardization initiatives evolved away from national
regulators and telecommunication monopolies to regional standards organizations made up of
state regulators, telecommunication operators, network service providers and private
manufacturers. For the first time, private equipment manufacturers could participate and
influence standards development. This allowed manufacturers to test designs early and work out
technical problems as standards were being theorized and developed. Newly organized regional
standards bodies represented a new regime shift in the “transfer of power” away from
nationalized telecommunication monopolies to industry organizations made up of different
private and public actors (Russell, 2006, p. 104). This increased competition and allowed for
faster market penetration and interoperability across regions and national boundaries in Europe
(David & Steinmueller, 1994).
In the post-monopoly era of the 1990s, privatized telecommunication providers and
manufacturers were able to contribute to standardization efforts, with multiple iterations of
development, aiming towards a common goal of a pan-European standard for mobile
communication while competing for a new, open market (Dupuis, 1995). With this new model of
private-public partnership, standards setting bodies such as the GSM could coordinate and create
technical and organizational avenues to rapidly innovate and test network principles. They could
even abandon techniques in early iterations of testing experiments, in ways that previously
nationalized monopolies backed by government run telecommunications operators could not
achieve. Russell has argued that this de-regulation of the telecommunications industry combined
with global reforms that enabled competition made ICT standardization more modular in

Modularity in standards development can be seen in the standardization processes created
by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI), which took over the GSM from
CEPT. The handover from CEPT to ETSI marked an important shift in the ability of the
standards body to enforce standards because of a new consensus framework based on a
memorandum of understanding where all signatories had to use and rollout services and products
compliant with the GSM standards by certain, binding dates. After the founding of the ETSI, the
GSM was absorbed and became a technical committee in 1989. The structure of the working
party would be that the GSM developed technical recommendations for approval through ETSI.
Within the GSM, proposals were written and produced by Special Mobile Groups with working
groups called Sub-technical Committees divided into tasks of oversight ranging from theoretical
to technical iterations of teleservices, network services, general utilities, and so on. Before
approval, development was carried out through general meetings that were held every few years;
these meetings were divided into three phases, and afterwards the newest phases of standards
were introduced to the market.
In 1987, the Memorandum of Understanding was drafted and acted as a binding
document to all signatories. The MOU created an open approach to the development of digital
cellular standards and created a platform for the effectiveness and the modular character of the
GSM. Initially, the MOU was signed by telecom operators and regulators from 13 countries who
committed to introduce GSM cellular standards in Europe by 1991. Earlier, the GSM had been
only composed of network operators and national administrations. In early meetings, equipment
manufacturers participated in GSM by invitation only, but in 1988 CEPT members agreed to
open membership to any European telecommunications manufacturers who wanted to participate
(Edquist, 2002). By including a range of private and public actors, the MOU created a consensus
83	  

framework for standardization development. The MOU eventually enabled transnational mobile
station operation and standardized interfaces between equipment. This would pave the way for
rapid GSM updates and faster market penetration worldwide. By 1996, the GSM MOU had 167
operators, from 103 countries with 20 pending applicants from Africa, Asia, Australasia, and
Middle East as full signatories (Garrard, 1998).
In addition to enabling transnational operation, the MOU also required service providers
and equipment manufacturers to make all their devices compliant with teleservices standards,
and this included SMS capabilities (Hillebrand, 2010, p. 132). By 1990 the MOU framework
required members to make SMS available for subscribers. Though it was initially rejected by
other working parties as an optional add-on service, the fourth meeting of the GSM decided that
it would become mandatory (Hillebrand, 2010, GSM 1991). The binding contract of the MOU
framework was a lynchpin for the success and interoperability of SMS because the MOU
required manufacturers and service providers to make the SMS teleservice available on all early
handsets, operating plans for subscribers (Temple 2002).
The MOU also established phases into GSM protocol introduction (GSM, 1997; GSM,
1991; GSM 01.06; ETSI, 1992). Initially, three phases were planned from 1985 through 1996
(Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 2+) (GSM, 1991; Abdel-Aziz, 2011). SMS was introduced during
the Phase 1, however handsets could only receive texts from service providers (e.g. to alert them
of a voice mail message waiting to be heard). Standardization development and technical
realization of the GSM continued through to 1996 until it was “frozen” in the Phase 2+ rollout
(Abdel-Aziz, 2011).
In addition to phases of introduction, the MOU Association formed a base of
transnational operation of mobile stations using GSM standardized interfaces and equipment.
84	  

This included what bandwidth frequency the national states and service operators would use for
GSM. The majority of GSM operates in the 900 MHz band (GSM900) in Europe, but there also
networks that operate in the 1800 MHz band (GSM1800) also called Personal Communication
Network (PCN) Digital Communication System (DCS1800) and in the US the 1900 MHz band
(GSM1900) Personal Communication System (PCS). While identical technology and
architecture are employed in GSM, different radio frequencies are used because of national limits
and governance over radio frequencies and their bandwidth (Eberspächer et al., 2001).
There are two types of broad services covered by the GSM standards. The foundation of
data transmission that provides the technical facilities are called “bearer services” (ETSI, 1992;
Hillebrand et al., 2010). Bearer services provide asynchronous and synchronous data transport
that can be circuit switched or packet switched. These services carry information that is
independent information between the user and network interfaces.26
Built on top of bearer services are teleservices, or what users are provided access to when
they use a mobile handset with mobile network coverage. Teleservices were developed in GSM
02.03 and included voice calls, Fax transmission, SMS, MHS access, Videotext access, and
Teletext transmission (ETSI 1992, p. 6). The SMS teleservice requires network operators to
create service centers, which accept messages from fixed networks, stores them and “processes
them in a store-and-forward modes” (Eberspächer et al., 2001, p. 52). The Short Message
Service Center (SMSC) accepts SMS from mobile stations (mobile handsets) which can be
forwarded to fixed networks, through gateways such as Fax or Email. In the GSM architecture
this new SMSC server was required for users to send and transmit messages from their mobile

handsets. The significance of the SMSC to the GSM architecture and the impact of SMS
innovation will be described at length later in this chapter.
In 1991, second generation digital technology was fully implemented creating the
possibility for data transmission in addition to voice calls. GSM data transmission was first
introduced through SMS as a two-way variant of the already existing and popular paging
networks (Edquist, 2002, p. 25). The MOU had aimed to establish the first phase by 1991. It was
finally accomplished in 15 countries by 1992 (Garrard, 1999, p. 164). Phase 2 standardization
was completed in 1995 with market introduction the following year. In Phase 2, ETSI included
more teleservices; these new services involved reworking portions of the earlier GSM standards
and introducing new features like user generated SMS. The terminals and network structure of
the Phase 2 standards had backwards compatibility with Phase 1 terminals and equipment but
would also include the SMSC as a new important network element (Mouly & Pautet, 1995).
A portion of the development and success of GSM and the SMS teleservice was because
of billing and industry cooperation (Taylor & Vincent 2005, p. 82). With the ability to store sent
and received messages on their devices in contrast to early models of voice messages stored on
operating servers, paved the way for market success over early forms such as paging. Consensus,
modularity through phases are both features of the GSM MOU framework that enabled the
introduction of SMS and other teleservices in the 1990s. The next section examines how SMS as
a teleservice is a unique innovation to the GSM standards.

Short Message Service as an innovation
Innovations are defined as “new creations of economic significance,” they can include
new products, but also new processes (Edquist, 2002, p. 2). The SMS standards are a unique
86	  

innovation to mobile telephony because they are made up of both processes of transmission and
components that create a new information object, the text message format. By 1990, the SMS
standard had been defined as a theoretical service, but it was not market ready. While the MOU
required service providers to provide services by 1991, they were only built around the reception
of text alerts. That is, users could receive text messages with their handsets, but not send them.
These early uses of SMS were usually to provide the user with a voice mail alert for messages
waiting to be heard or other notices from service providers (Hillebrand, 2010).

Figure	  2	  -­	  Three	  parts	  of	  the	  GSM	  Architecture	  

In order to understand how SMS is an innovation within the GSM, a description of the
network architecture and elements is needed. The basic network architecture of GSM is made up
of three interconnected parts. The first part is the mobile station subsystem (MSS), and it
contains two elements. The first component is the user’s mobile handset or mobile station (MS).
The MS is a terminal that includes the equipment to make and receive calls, to send and receive
data within a mobile network. The MS contains a subscriber identity module (SIM card) that
allows users to make calls or send data through a mobile network, and be billed and located by
87	  

their service provider. SIM cards can be put in and taken out of the MS with relative ease, so
that subscribers can exchange service and handsets over time. The MS also has an International
Mobile Station Equipment Identifier (IMEI) number that is unique to the handset. The combined
and decoupled SIM cards and handsets in the GSM to provide users privacy and different
mobility options (such as a SIM card for work and a SIM card for personal calls but a handset for
private and business work). Users can switch out SIM cards as well as switch and change mobile
stations depending on network coverage and teleservice pricing. The mobile handset also
includes a radio transceiver, the display to the user, and a digital signal processor to send and
receive calls and data.
When users send a text message from their phone, their handset transmits the message to
the second part of the network architecture known as the base station subsystem (BSS). The BSS
is made up of a base station (BS) and a base station transceiver (BST). The base station (or cell
tower) and a base station transceiver hands off the message to the network’s closest Message
Service Center (MSC), which is an intelligent terminal connected to other terminals.
The third part of the GSM architecture includes the Mobile Switching Network (MSS), in
includes the switching centers and databases that contain information for routing and
teleservices. MSCs are also connected to SMSCs for text message transmission. The SMSC
locates the receiver’s handset through geolocation registers databases stored by the network
provider and send off the message if the receiver’s handset was on, or hold it until the message
could be delivered to a handset that was on and within range of mobile network coverage.
The addition of the new SMSC server allowed users to send and receive messages across
a network, instead of point-to-point (as they would with analog or landline phones). GSM
network providers were required to introduce SMSCs to their network architecture so that they
88	  

could route and deliver messages to subscribers in their network or handoff messages to another
service provider. The SMSC acts as a checkpoint or way station to send off messages to network
operators and handoff confirmation back to users on any network. SMSCs deliver text messages
that are a maximum of 140 octet payload, or up to 160 characters. Text messages can also be sent
in Unicode, 8 bit and 16 bit encoding, though usually infrequently. There exists another service
for batch, one-way transmission of SMS to users in a given network area called cell broadcast. It
is often used by network operators or authorities to send emergency alert messages, such as
Amber Alerts in parts of the United States (Abdollah, 2013; CTIA, 2012). Moreover, Unicode
can be used in cell broadcast as “hidden SMS” for operators to update firmware (Trabelsi et al.,
2008).
As a new introduction and intelligent terminal, the SMSC is not just another piece of
banal equipment: it represents a significant introduction to the GSM network architecture that
makes SMS transmission possible. Moreover, because of the GSM MOU, it was a mandatory
application for mobile handsets. It is the element of store-and-forward transmission process that
illustrates the two-fold innovation of SMS as a new product and wireless communication
process. With the ability to store, send and receive messages on personal mobile handsets in
contrast to early models of voice messages stored on operating servers, mobile subscribers loved
text messaging. A “new unique SMS argot” began to appear, and many communication scholars
have argued it was an early driver for the mass uptake and catalyst for the success of mobile
communication (Taylor & Vincent, 2005, p. 83).

89	  

Network Architecture and Elements
The basic network architecture of the GSM structure is hierarchical and the system is made up of
two areas of network components: infrastructure that is fixed and supports the reception and
transmission of data (such as voice calls); and the mobile handsets that users use as they move
throughout network coverage. The network services that operators provide to users use a radio or
air interface to communicate information to the network infrastructure. Within the fixed network
there are subnetworks called subsystems in the GSM standards, including the radio network, the
mobile switch network and the management network (Eberspächer et al., 2001, p. 35).

90	  

Figure 3 illustrates the general system architecture of the GSM network that supports the
transmission of a text message, which relies upon an SMSC as an intelligent terminal to store
and forward the text message. The SMS standard splits SMS operation into two different
processes of data transmission: Mobile originating transmission, where the text message is being
sent from the MS to the closest MSC, and mobile terminating transmission, where the mobile
switching network routes the text message to the receiver. While SMS is two-way
communication system, the process of sending a text to the network infrastructure and the
process of the network’s transmitting the message to a receiver’s mobile station are standardized
in separate ways.
In the mobile originating process, the MS sends the SMS to the base station, which uses a
wireless interface to transmit the data from the originating MSC nearest to the user. The MSC
hands off the data to the SMSC which stores messages, interrogates databases for more routing
information, and delivers text messages to recipient users through the appropriate MSC. The
SMSC’s ability to store messages is important because when the GSM was first being conceived
users did not keep their phones on all the time, and there was a high likelihood that the SMS
could not be received the first time it was sent. In the event that the receiver’s mobile station was
turned off the SMSC would store messages until their phones were back in range of network
coverage or were turned on to receive data.
The Mobile Switching Network is made up of switching centers and databases with
routing and service information that relies primarily on the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) to
perform the switching function of the fixed networked to the mobile network. While there may
be many MSCs in a network, a single MSC controls BSC and BST in the BSS. Between each of
these stations are different air and grounded interfaces, and there are a variety of communication
91	  

relationships that transfer user data through signaling and wire transfer. SMS data are transmitted
across the Mobile Switching Network through Common Channel Signaling System 7 (SS7).
Within the management layer, each of the network elements (both wireless and wire-line) use
SS7 for call setup, authentication routing, and management for the control of information
transmission (Zerfos et al., 2006).
The MSC is the interface to the SMSC to originate and terminate message delivery. The
transmission of text messages and confirmation of their receipt is built upon authenticating and
gathering data from subscription databases known as the home location register (HLR) and a
visitor location register (VLR) in the SMSC. These databases contain billing and user
information registered in the network and their current location of their mobile handset within a
cell of network coverage. This geolocation data is captured as part of a mobile station roaming
number (MSRN) based upon the number of the last visited MSC to route a call.
MSCs use these HLR and VLR subscriber databases to authenticate and transmit call and
text data. Primarily there is one central HLR for each public land mobile network (PLMN), and
one VLR for each MSC within a network. As a central repository of user data, HLR has records
of every subscriber and their mobile handset in the provider’s network. It stores all of the
permanent subscriber data as well as the link to the current location of the mobile station. While
the VLR stores register stores, which are traveling in a current cell area associated with a MSC.
As users move through networks cells, mobile stations update MSCs and VLRs store these over
time, mobile users from outside networks can also appear in VLR of a visiting network (if they
have an agreement with other network operators). This creates a way for incoming calls or other
teleservices like SMS to be routed to a MS quickly, as a user moves throughout cells in network
coverage. These constant updates to the VLR, create traces of information, or data about data.
92	  

The information about the location of MS moving in networks are part of what makes telephony
metadata. In addition to locations of MS, SMS metadata is also generated by the transmission
wrapper of the transfer protocol data unit (TPDU), or the data format that SMS messages are
formatted.

The SMS Format: Transfer Protocol Data Unit
The way that SMS data is formatted and transmitted has a significance not only to the GSM
standard, but to how it is enacted by the system and interface on it is received by a mobile
station. The message itself can be used and rendered in a variety of ways. There are 3 types of
formats of SMS (7 bit and 8 bit encoded, cell broadcast, and Unicode) (GSM 03.40). There are
four layers in the SMS protocol stack: the application layer, transfer layer, relay layer, and a link
layer. The protocol stack transmits a transfer protocol data unit, a format that will be discussed in
this section. Just as the SMSC became a new element in the basic architecture of mobile
transmission it also enabled a new format of written communication.
The SMS in a format that is sent from the MS to the SMSC to the forwarding MS.
The signaling protocol that a GSM network uses to exchange signal messages has a physical
layer, a data link layer and a message layer. For the mobile station’s message layer, there are
three sublayers within the mobile stations message layer, including connection management,
mobility management and resource management. Where connection management sublayer
manages call services and SMS. The mobility management layer establishes connections to
between the MS and the MSC, it can also update location data. While the resource management
sublayer creates the physical connection over the air interface to transmit signaling information
between the MS and the BSS. The message layer for the MSC has four sublayers, including the
93	  

base system substation application part (BSSAP), the message transfer part (MTP), and the
signaling connection control part (SCCP) protocols. SCCP packets carry SMS messages through
transfer protocol data units (Table 2).
Once the MS receives the TPDU, the messaging client in all GSM phones should be able
to receive a TPDU, decode and store the message on the MS. Table 2 illustrates a 7 bit encoded
mobile originating text message that says “hellohello”. It breaks the TPDU up by octet. Within
the TPDU there are several pieces of information: the length of the SMSC, the address of the
originating phone number, the service center, and the delivery message. It includes the user’s
phone number, international time stamp, and how the message is encoded.

process, the SMSC creates layers to the TPDU be creating and returning message delivery
receipts. The SMSC stores messages until the receiver’s handset is turned on or the within
network range of a MSC.
Within SMSC can be two more intelligent terminals, Interworking Service Center
(IWSC) or a Gateway Service Center (GWSC). Depending on whether the message is originating
or terminating the IWSC or GWSC looks up the routing information in the HLR and sends the
message to the matched receiver’s closest MSC. The MSC then forwards the short message to
the appropriate MS for delivery. Once the message has been routed, the SMSC adds a time stamp
(in SMS-DELIVER TP-SCTS). All MS must receive and submit a short message TPDU and
return delivery reports after they have been received.
This section discussed the basic network architecture and network elements needed to
send and receive text messages with GSM mobile equipment. It also examined the format with
which SMS are delivered, the TPDU format and the traces of metadata that are used and created
in order to transmit messages. Each of these processes, artifacts and information were built upon
standards that are often hidden yet their materiality and effect on mobile communication and data
transmission cannot be underestimated. The next section discusses the significance of this
infrastructure and standards as innovation to the wireless text transmission landscape the future
of the mobile communication.

Concluding Remarks
This chapter has presented a history of the infrastructure and technical architecture that makes
SMS possible. It presented the standardization process, the primary development point that led to
the network architecture and the establishment of the SMS format. The format itself is made up
96	  

of routing information and other user-created data that creates telephony metadata s part of
transmission through the SMSC. These traces of transmission are not only evidence that
messages are being sent and received, their generation speaks to the significance that this form of
communication has at the beginning of the twenty-first century.
For all these elements to work together, standards, standardization and infrastructure
needed to be developed. A clear example of consensus framework and modularity in action can
be seen through the MOU agreement that enforced mandatory services into the introduction of
second generation mobile communication infrastructure in the early 1990s. Policy researchers,
such as Jacques Pelkmans (2001) have identified the European approach of the MOU consensus
framework as more successful than the non-cooperative, market driven and competing process
that the FCC encouraged in the US for digital mobile standards development in the late 1980s.
Even today, the US has a handful of competing mobile network standards that users can choose
from (including GSM) that make it difficult for cost-switching and new contracts. However,
Americans from every demographic participate in texting despite the fact that texting had a
slower uptake than in Europe because of pricing. Clearly, the harmonized European approach of
the MOU framework and the prevalence of competing standards in the US points to the tradeoffs
that are present between mandated and market-driven standards development in wireless
telecommunications policy (Gandal et al., 2003; Goggin & Spurgeon, 2005).
The development of the GSM standards, from theoretical planning, to technical
realization, and eventual market dominance in the early 2000s, relied upon a number of hidden
and under-examined elements of standardization and information infrastructure (Hillebrand,
2002). Consensus through the GSM MOU and mandatory implementation, modularity in
standardization through three phases of standards rollouts and updates, and the introduction of a
97	  

new element to the network architecture led to the innovation of SMS on every network and
every mobile handset that uses GSM. The SMS format and the SMSC intelligent server terminal
were crucial in creating the history of the text messaging teleservice in the GSM network
architecture. Cooperation from national regulators across regions, international professional
organizations, and the telecommunications industry made the commercial success and universal
uptake of SMS possible, however without the open standardization process shaped by the GSM’s
MOU and signatory stakeholders second generation mobile telephony as we know it would not
have been. Without pan-European cooperation, we may have seen competing mobile telephony
standards stall interoperability and connectivity (as it happened in the US) for decades. What was
originally seen as an inconsequential data channel where surplus data could be transmitted--by
some accounts a “strange duckling” of all the GSM teleservices (Trosby, 2004)—led to a
universal format. This swan shows little sign of slowing down. Further, SMS has led to a variety
of internet connected platforms that have transformed the digital landscape in the 21st century-from Twitter to M-Pesa, to crises and public health initiatives through cell broadcast. There is no
doubt that the history of SMS emergence and standardization led to its uptake and broad appeal,
and still, that this standard format of networked data transmission will shape the future of
wireless personal communications with mobile devices.
As I have argued, it is the consensus and modularity of the GSM MOU standards
framework that made SMS proliferation possible, and can be credited for why it is so prevalent,
even today. While GSM is still one of the most widely used standards suite for mobile
communication across the world (Goggin, 2012; Pelkmans, 2001; Temple, 2002), SMS is even
more prevalent because it was created as a unique teleservice innovation through consensus and
modularity. The MOU created a principle of consensus that many other standardizations stories
98	  

are not tied too, and like many abandoned forms of communication, it’s easy to see how SMS
might not have survived if the GSM had not required signatories to enable SMS as a mandatory
teleservice for second generation mobile telephony. Given this unique history of standards
development that enabled text messaging, and its ubiquity as a practice at every level of
society—it becomes all the more important for us to examine the recent history of the hidden,
invisible standards and standardization processes that make mobile communication all across the
world possible.

Chapter 4: Sending and Deleting Text Messages: Mobile Media and the Future of Personal
Digital Collections

Abstract: This chapter provides an introduction to the processes of sending, receiving, deleting,
and storing text messages. Using techniques from infrastructure studies and media archaeology,
it illustrates how the text message as a digital format has been enacted by the mobile operating
system on mobile phones. In turn, it shows how the text message format structures mobile
communication over time in different contexts of creation and collection. It also highlights how
the format is enacted in an operating system: how text messages are stored on device hardware
such as flash memory, and in various end-uses such as deletion and in surveillance. The digital
materiality of text messages in transmission, storage, and receipt is shown to have social and
political consequences for the future of fonds or collections of personal digital records that
people create with their mobile phones.

Keywords: Respect des fonds, format, deletion, telephony metadata, digital materiality, personal
digital archives

Introduction to the problem
The text message, or Short Message Service (SMS), is one of the most circulated digital formats
created with mobile devices. Curiously however, text messages are not as curated, or managed as
are other digital formats that appear in personal digital collections (like email, MP3s, and digital
110	  

photographs). They are often seen as ephemeral, without lasting or transferable qualities because
of the nature of the format as an information object and how it is used in information behavior.
Few empirical studies of personal information management (PIM) or personal digital archives
(PDA) created with mobile devices mention mobile media such as texts, instead they focus upon
digital photographs or mobile video. Coincidentally however, there is a rapidly growing field
that focuses upon recovering SMS corpora in mobile digital forensics, and small-scale digital
device forensic science. Despite advances in forensic science, there are very few institutional
efforts or policy outside legal contexts for e-discovery that directly address the collection and
access of text messages over time. Why and how do we actively manage text messages? And
moreover, why don’t we save them like other personal digital records and mobile media? Text
messages as an early mobile format are not only indicative of our increasingly networked world,
but they also represent a genre of emerging digital records of everyday life and new information
practice (Aspray & Hayes, 2011) that is often described as the “constant touch” or connection to
the network (Agar, 2013).
While SMS increasingly make up a portion of our personal digital collections--what
archivists call the fonds of our lives--they often don’t last beyond the life of the phone itself
because they are not transferred for backup or emulation. Because texts often don’t cross
boundaries after they become inactive, they are subject to the device settings, or the user’s
curation decisions based on the limits of the local storage. Currently, text messages don’t exist in
archival or preservation contexts. If mobile devices and mobile networks are the present and
future of personal documentation and thus social and cultural archives, it is important to
understand how these new digital formats operate at material, conceptual and logical levels
(Thibodeau, 2002)—ranging from the mobile operating system on device hardware to the
111	  

markets in which we buy and use these services. Text messages are created by users, they are
built around device practices and the infrastructure of wireless transmission. In the next section I
present an entry point for understanding how the device, messaging client, and local storage
affect our experience of self and identity in the networked age. Then I discuss the importance of
approaching the text message as a format story, and how that is important to the description and
appraisal of personal digital collections (or fonds). I take a media archeology approach and
employ the technique of layers analysis from infrastructure studies to show how the format is
enacted in the messaging client through sending and receiving text messages.

Some Contexts for Blank Texts
In the early 2000s teenagers in Poland reportedly began to send each other blank text messages.
According to online discussion forums like PolishForums.com, Reddit, or GSM Arena, the blank
text was originally conceived as a way to communicate to your sweetheart without words. Just
like most text messages, there is a sender who creates the message with a SMS client, a receiver
who receives it with their mobile device, a metadata wrapper (also known as a transfer protocol
data unit) for the text message as part of its transmission, and finally a mobile network to support
the transmission of data between users’ devices. Except, unlike most text messages, blank texts
appear empty of content in the recipient’s messaging client (see Figure 4). A way of letting your
girlfriend or boyfriend know that you are thinking of them in a message that rejects the need for
words. These sentimental texts are beyond, or outside of words, but still framed in the messaging
client. The blank message is a potential expression of intimacy.28

The “nothingness” of blank messages and their materiality has been explored in Dever, M.
(2010). Greta Garbo's foot, or, sex, socks and letters. Australian Feminist Studies, 25(64), 163173.

A decade later in a lifestyle article reporting on why texting turns working adults “back
into teenagers” (Bernstein, 2011) the blank text was described as a power play for professional
New Yorkers to carry on earlier face-to-face arguments. A short time later, Glamour magazine’s
sex and dating advice column would describe the motivation behind the blank text as a way to
“score a callback” and perhaps seem mysterious to your partner (Slater, 2013). The blank text
had become a way for Americans to continue arguments, flirt, or create confusion without the
stakes of creating a textual trace within the metadata wrapper of the transfer protocol data unit by
leaving the content of the message empty. Another way to let your sweetheart know you were
annoyed with them or to cause a reaction, the blank text became a way to continue earlier
encounters, a trace without a trace. Empty of textual content, but still gravid with meaning, the

blank text power play puts the onus of interpreting possible meanings and varied intentionality of
the sender upon the recipient.
Indeed, blank texts have increasingly begun to appear and to confuse recipients in other
ways. Quite recently, Apple’s popular iPhone mobile operating system (iOS) updated to its
seventh version. This version update employs a new codec of emojis, popular (sometimes
animated) emoticons of cartoon faces and icons like a heart or a shovel. The iOS7 codec is
proprietary and builds off of the ISO/IEC 10646 Unicode standard but it is not backwards
compatible (including most other library messaging codecs) on other mobile operating systems.
The result of this iOS7 platform update involves, among other incompatibility issues, a slew of
blank texts when iOS users send emojis in texts to recipients whose mobile operating systems are
not versions of iOS. Symbian and Android users report receiving blank texts, in addition to other
kinds of corrupted iMessages (the proprietary messaging format that iOS defaults to unless
otherwise changed). More simply, these kinds of blank text messages are a result of receiving
emoji texts from a closed platform mobile operating system like iOS. Amongst many possible
meanings, blank texts from iOS users communicate the incompatibility issues across mobile
platforms.
Blank texts are also often reportedly received during natural disasters, such as
earthquakes, storms, or hurricanes that debilitate and knock over cell towers. The store-andforward architecture of most 2G and 3G mobile networks involves storing data (like text
messages) until transmission hand-off.29 Cell towers that are damaged, power down, or go off-the
network because of natural disasters may produce empty, corrupted, incomplete or delayed text
messages sent to recipients long after text messages were sent, or after cell towers and networks

went down and the storm has passed. This can often lead to heartbreaking stories from families
of victims abroad waiting to hear whether loved ones caught in such disasters have survived,
characterized as a “delayed signal or a dying plea” (Barnard, 2010). The blank texts can give
hope for survival, and they may also later be recast as messages from the deceased in the
afterlife.
Blank texts, and what they may mean over time, resist what Mark Poster (2004) has
called the grammatical structure of the information system found in our text messaging clients,
because they carry multiple possibilities of interpretation, intention and agency as traces of
mobile communication. Still further, they rely upon individual users, writers and readers, to
interpret their contexts at points of creation, boundary crossings (transmission), and reception.
And still further, the possibilities of storing or deleting these empty traces are subject to the data
structure and storage media of our mobile devices. While the primacy of their creation contexts
as digital records may be obscured, their interpretation and significance through time, as
evidence of transactions between people, may change are subject to multiple infrastructures. The
contexts of sending, receiving, even deleting blank texts provides a promissory encounter to the
power that text messages as digital formats have over the reception and storage of mobile media
as well as their growing presence in our personal digital collections. It also shows the power of
metadata that is generated, collected, and imbued with meaning when we communicate with text
messages and how metadata, separate from content, can be interpreted and used in different
ways. The manifold reasons for blank text messages (and their reception) illustrates the knot of
infrastructure, communication practices, meaningful records, and digital collections that continue
to unfold and form, even now as I write this. In the following chapter I show how the future

115	  

archival possibilities of text messages as digital records, a new mobile media format, depends on
the infrastructures of transmission and storage.

The Text Message as a Format Story
Many communication scholars have studied the transition from telecommunications to
mobile media and what “the shift into media brings” (Goggin & Horth, 2009, p. 5). We have
seen portable communication devices like mobile phones that primarily supported mobile
telephony become media devices that transform into production tools with memory storage,
because they have, among others, cameras, video recording capability, and applications that
connect to the Internet. As our phones are increasingly used to create and capture traces, they
become apart of our documentation practices, including the ways in which we collect things.
Personal collections that include digital formats represent a change in the kinds of digital traces
that represent individuals’ collections, or the fonds that people create as part of living their lives,
creating records with information and communication technologies (ICTs). The word fonds
comes from the French, literally fount (as in fountain or source) and underpins “le respect pour
les fonds”—a fundamental organizing principle in archival science of respecting the creator or
source of an organic collection or records group. Since the 1990s, archival theorists such as
Terry Cook have argued that the fonds should be an “intellectual construct” (1993, p. 33) that is
made up of both physical artifacts and conceptual understandings, including descriptions of how
an organic collection comes to be created. In earlier chapters, I argued that the description,
theory, and material understandings of mobile communication infrastructure is vital to the future
preservation and appraisal of digital records coming out of mobile ICTs. For our purposes here,
connecting the story of how a format is created and enacted to the infrastructure of its
116	  

transmission will guide theory about how text messages are increasingly part of the fonds of
personal digital collections.
The infrastructure that supports SMS is not only important to the processes of
transmission and pricing, but also represents the production of a new digital format at the turn of
the century because it has implications for labor, value, and evidence. Many social scientists
have studied the unique text speak or texting argot that has developed in conjunction with the
teleservice (Taylor & Vincent, 2005). Still further, linguists have identified the new forms of
orality that this “typed speech” supports (Gurak, 2008; McWhorter, 2013; Parks, 2013). As texts
become more commonplace they are frequently seen and represented all around us, in
commercials, as plot devices in television and in movies, for political and charity campaigns,
even in real-time voting on television.30 We also are beginning to see them as objects or
categories of digital evidence in our laws and governance. For example, many states in the
United States ban texting while driving, while the president has the ability to text emergency
alerts for national disasters through a cell broadcast system. Universities use text messages for
campus safety alerts. And recently, texting Amber alerts have come under scrutiny in parts of
California. Short code texting, that is, sending a short text to a clearinghouse instead of a
complete phone number is also frequently used in voting for variety shows on television such as
American Idol or Dancing with the Stars. As a new digital format, there exist evolving sets of
genres for text and methods of transmission, for coordinating social events (e.g., “i’m running
late to our meeting”), to maintaining and creating primary relationships between immediate

See for example, Gossip Girl television series (2007-2012), Sherlock television series (20102013), President Obama’s texting fundraising during his first presidential campaign, or voting for
winners on American Idol television series (2002-2014).

family,31 or even group text messages. Text messages can also be enrolled in SMS gateways to
the Internet, and many social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr have SMS
client applications that allow users to send text messages to update their profiles.
As this tide of mobile media devices, social media platforms, and digital formats
circulated amongst them rises, it is instructive, if not necessary, for information and
communication scholars to examine how these digital traces are captured, but also how they are
lost, half-hidden, and obscured. It is incumbent upon us to locate the places and occasions for
these traces to reveal themselves, including the conditions of their development (both technical
and social). One avenue for locating these conditions of emergence is through the development
and enactment of formats in their use and stabilization. In a recent book on the development of
the MP3 digital music format, historian of sound Jonathan Sterne (2012) argues that formats
structure our experience of media and the ways societies communicate over time. Formats,
which have long, unusual, and sometimes competing histories, structure our experiences of
recorded communication, in the moment and over time because of the way that they capture and
tailor our consumption of information. From telegrams, to hanging files, to JPEGs and PDFs,
formats both analog and digital have a material power over how we interpret, use, and
communicate information (Blanchette 2011, Yates 1993).
We interact with formats as information objects with content and context in a variety of
ways: we consume them; rely upon them as evidence of change; they prove that transactions
between people, organizations, and states have occurred. Formats not only represent recorded
information, they document and reveal clues about the political and economic moments in which
systems and devices were built, conceived, used and store information for access and retrieval.
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
31
Recently, Pew Research found that 25% of American couples text each other while both are at
home (Lenhart & Duggan, 2014).
118	  

The circulation of formats is co-constitutive, meaning that they shape our communication
practices, just as we build up expectations around them through their use. Formats as
representations of digital objects, and the ways they are enacted in systems, are worth examining
at the logical and material levels, because they point to the significance of standards, protocols
and infrastructure in our lives. The circulation of formatted objects can also reveal the political
and economic impact of ideas that move through networks culture (see for example Allen 2000,
Brunton 2013). Moreover, mobile media formats point to how perceptions of place, space and
the transmission of information have changed with the transition to wireless networks that
support the connectivity of mobile devices (Farman 2011). While archival preservation,
analytical and descriptive bibliography, and museum conservation are all examples of applied
format inquiry in library and information science, digital formats and computers have yet to be
engaged in the same ways that records collections, books, or material objects are in histories of
formats.32
As mobile devices and mobile networks increasingly connect us to the Internet, our
banks, our employers, and our governments, there is a diffusion of digital traces that are
formatted in a variety of ways, sometimes in competing or closed ways that may not be easily
understood and may prevent long-term archival preservation. Often these range from open
unencrypted formats to proprietary formats that are device or platform specific. The formats that
mobile users encounter with their devices can be staggering: Multi-Media Messages (MMS),
iMessages, Tweets, BlackBerry Messages (BBM), Email, GPS pins.

the University of Maryland, the Media Archaeology Center at the University of Colorado at
Boulder, and the Berlin Media Archaeological Fundus at Humboldt University are all examples
where this kind of applied research happens, each are primarily situated in media studies and
digital humanities.

are formatted through standards and technical protocol that allow messages to be transmitted
across a network of devices, phones, transceivers, routers, intelligent terminals, and location
databases. These messages have content, context, and structure, and through the shell of a
standardized format, information is captured, structured, exchanged across systems and rendered
to users. While many digital formats intended for mobile devices have become obsolete
(consider mobile 8-bit ringtones, Sega Game Gear console and games, or MiniDisc players),
some formats have formidable staying power because of industry lock-in, ease of use, or
consumer popularity. However, ubiquity and ease of use may not guarantee possibilities for
preservation and long-term access.
One of the earliest forms of mobile media incunabula is, in fact, the text message. The
format is used by many millions of people around the world everyday, and remains enrolled in
digital collections despite the ease with which they are lost, deleted or overwritten with our
mobile devices. Further, they may be used because of the ease with which they can be deleted.
And as I will argue, text messages, their circulation and deletion points to the conditions of
emergence and information practices related to the personal digital collections that are created
today with mobile devices. This argument is about the significance and stabilization of a format,
but it is also about device context, because devices structure formatted information but also,
ultimately, shape our personal digital collections and archival contexts through thresholds of
access and processes of transmission. The next section discusses the framework that informs this
work and the method of analysis.

Theoretical Framework, Methods
This chapter takes a media archaeology approach (Parikka, 2012) to the text message and
the infrastructure that supports the processes of sending, receiving, and deleting. It reveals the
stakes of infrastructure of mobile communication, and the material consequences of
transmission, in the vein of what Heather Horst (2013) has called the “third wave of mobile
media communication studies” (p. 147). As I argued in chapter 2, sending and receiving text
messages may appear to be immaterial processes, but instead they are utterly material processes
because of their digital transmission and storage, as well as the individual and social practices
that we have built up around them that range from sleeptexting (Roberts, 2013), which is now
classified as a new kind of parasomnia (akin to sleep walking), or phone stacking games that are
seen as part of emerging small group digital detoxing customs (Ha, 2012; Tell, 2013). The
materiality of text messages can be seen in their transmission and storage, but also in the ways
that we organize our lives around the practices that incorporate (or exclude) them.
In chapter 3 I show how standards development, transmission protocols, and network
architecture create the text messages that are subsequently relied upon as a formatted digital
record. This chapter argues that text messages have material consequences through processes of
transmission, storage, and deletion. It illustrates how, at the levels of the storage and memory,
the text message emerges as a digital format that is enacted in a mobile operating system through
the messaging client application, through its transmission and storage, and through the
generation and collection of telephony metadata as part of transmission and storage across
devices in mobile networks. In turn, it shows how the text as a format, its reception and storage
on mobile devices, structures the experience of mobile communication with networks.
Understanding the process of sending and receiving text messages at the micro or
121	  

individual level of the device (in hand) gives us insight into what the text message is, both as
cultural product and evidence of social technical change. However text messages are not alone in
personal computing contexts and digital collections. Many new digital formats and information
objects coming out of personal computing and social media can and have been documented in
comprehensive detail (Sterne, 2012; Van House et al., 2005). Mobile media appear to be fuzzy, if
not completely overlooked by studies on the formation of personal digital collections today,
despite having circulated since the mid-1990s.33 While many new media, communication, and
technology scholars note how digital formats such as the powerpoint, digital photographs and the
MP3 format point to the materiality of digital information in our everyday lives (Blanchette,
2011), few engage with the impact of the mobile phone as a site of inscription, or as a writing
technology--one that creates and sends texts as a site of inscription, but also serves as a storage
technology. By bringing enduring archival constructions (such as fonds, collection, metadata) to
this archeological excavation, we can reveal possible archival contexts and collecting futures.
Some would tell this format story through the development and standardization of the
telecommunication protocol (as I have done in Chapter 3) or how it is conceived in juridical
contexts (as I do in Chapter 5). The conception and stabilization of standards is often seen in the
form of format histories in bibliography, sociology of texts, critical code studies or digital
forensics. But another way to tell this story is through the enactment of the format through its
use, exchange and circulation as part of personal digital collections. In the second half of this
chapter I discuss the significance of mobile data transmission through the sending and receiving
of text messages, how they cross boundaries through their transmission across networks, and
how they cross boundaries of storage in mobile devices. First, I briefly introduce the elements

See for example, Lee (2011) or the recent Archivaria special issue 76, on personal digital
archives that neglects traces created with mobile devices (2013).

needed to send and receive texts, including standards, infrastructure, and equipment. And then I
look deeper into the elements of the text message itself as a format by examining its digital
materiality and its relation the future of mobile media and personal digital archives as conceived
by archival scholars, personal information management (PIM) researchers, and individual
archive creators themselves. In the rest of this article I discuss the elements needed to send a text
message and what these are built on top of, below the interface, and the process of receiving a
text message. I then discuss the acts of storing, deleting messages and the landscape of local
memory storage on phones as it has changed dramatically in the last 25 years. In the last section I
discuss text messages as possibilities for personal and institutional digital collections. This
includes the metadata that are generated and collected when we transmit text messages.
For our purposes here I have chosen to examine the text message at the level of the
device and the mobile operating system at the micro level (Edwards, 2002; Misa 1988) cutting
under the motivations of the sender and the actual text content, to the level of the device and how
the format is enacted within the system. My reasoning is twofold: First, examining the text
message at the level of the mobile operating system and the message client allows for a close
examination of an application that undergirds a range of other technologies (I argue that this kind
of close reading has not been done before). Messaging clients are not add-ons or creative
applications on mobile phones, they come factory issued on all devices and in all mobile
operating systems.34 Second, despite the increasing memory storage and processing power of
each new iteration of phones, they all operate under the same principle of discrete elements,

This is because of the standardization of 2G digital cellular mobile telephony, see chapter 2 on
the consensus framework of the GSM and why all mobile telephony standards since the 1990s
support SMS.
123	  

modular in character, messaging clients across all operating systems, hardware and software,
enact the same functions of reception and transmission of SMS.
Sending and Receiving
The processes that support sending text messages are deceptively complex, hidden by
wirelessness, the smallness and the brevity with which messages are created and arrive. Let’s
take it apart from the initial input encounter or site of creation, the initial inscription. First, the
user is responsible for creating some content, like “hey, what’s up?” and then they choose a
recipient, selecting their phone number and sending the message (the user may also choose a
recipient first and then create a message). The subscriber’s mobile network provider adds more
pieces of information about the message, including location data about what cell the message is
being sent from, the provider’s service center attempts to locate the recipients location by
pinging a visitor location registry. The metadata that is wrapped around the SMS as it is being
transmitted is described at length in Chapter 2, but in summary, it involves the time of
transmission, location data about the cells that the users are in, and time stamps from the handoffs between networks.
When a user writes the text message or when a recipient receives the message, she
employs the messaging client, or a native application on her phone. This application is accessed
through the mobile operating system on the phone. In earlier years, manufacturers created their
own operating systems and updates specific to the phone, (there were 11 handset models offered
for most of the 1990s, each with different operating systems). By the 2000s, thousands of phones
and hundreds of interfaces with proprietary mobile operating systems existed. Today the main
operating systems that have emerged across the world include Android, Bada, Blackberry, iOS,
and Windows Phone. Each of these and historical operating systems have messaging clients for
124	  

SMS support. For most of the 1990s and early 2000s, text message clients were structured
similarly to Email clients--they had inboxes and outboxes for incoming and sent messages. The
inbox/outbox data structure is still supported by most featurephones used throughout the world,
however smartphone operating systems and featurephones are not mutually exclusive categories.
Some high-powered feature phones (also known as “smart phone lite”) support touch screens and
web browsing. Since the early 2000s, smartphones operating systems and some featurephone
operating systems have supported threaded text messages. In clients that support threaded text
messaging, messages are grouped together akin to instant messaging interfaces (Figure 5).
Although threaded text messages do not structure the SMS data in a different way, the impact on
how users read, write and receive threaded text messages in newer messaging clients needs
further study.

125	  

A sent text message also represents different kinds of transactional data that may not be
read or seen by users. This transactional data may inform different actors in the delivery and
receipt of messages (e.g. service provider, network provider who hosts the Short Message
Service Center, the handset manufacturer, operating system developers). It contains wrappers of
metadata that enable transmissions amongst other uses, which I will address in the next section,
but the metadata is collected in different ways through the transmission infrastructure for
different means. The sender in effect pays for (and expects) the delivery of the message. The
subscriber who originates the message automatically contains a return address from their mobile
station; this includes their SIM card number, the equipment’s IEMEI number, and some
information about their home network. For a service provider the teleservice is a data
transmission, and it requires a network, cell towers, a home location registry and a variety of
other identifiers to carry the message to the recipient. It may also involve one or more network
providers depending on the location and service provider of the recipient. For the recipient, it
involves a message that, in the U.S. for example, she pays for as well, however pricing is
different in different markets. The SMS message can be stored on her phone for a certain amount
of time and this is a significant to the impact of its reception, and evidence as proof of its
reception on a recipient’s mobile station shows that metadata has been created and supported
throughout the transmission process by crossing boundaries (Bearman 1996), creating and
acquiring traces of its transmission along the way.
When a text message is transmitted across wireless mobile networks it leaves traces of its
transmissions, at each level and juncture of infrastructure store and forward architecture. These
boundary crossings represent a vulnerability in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of a
complete and fixed record. Earlier I have written about the boundary crossings of records in
126	  

information systems as a moment of weakness in archival theory and archival records
management (see Chapter 2). The layers of context that are acquired as messages are sent,
delivered and received are information about the reality of the information object of a thing. This
data about data is metadata, both structural and contextual.35

The Necessary Parts
A few things are needed to send or receive text messages with a mobile phone’s interface,
including a device with a SIM card (Figure 6), network access to a service provider’s area of
coverage, and network architecture (like cell towers and base station transceivers). Each of these
parts is enrolled into large-scale technical network architecture and infrastructures bootstrapped
to plain old telephone systems (POTS) and PLMN, as well Internet gateways. Mobile phones all
operate with a few different global digital cellular telephony standards (including GSM, CDMA,
UMTS). In order for a mobile phone to connect to a mobile operator it must be able to speak to
your network service provider through one or more of these standards. For telecommunication
and mobile standards bodies, mobile phones or handsets (“handys” in some parts of the world),
they are called “mobile stations” (MS). In each MS is a microprocessor, a digital signal
processor to send and receive messages and voice data over radio frequency, an antenna, a
speaker, a microphone, a battery, internal ROM and flash memory with a mobile operating
system (some phones have removable storage cards and multiple SIM card slots), and finally a
subscriber identity module, also known as a SIM card. The handset itself has an International
Mobile Station Equipment Identity (IEMI) number which is an essentially a serial number for the

Metadata can also be a record of transaction, too. Chapter 5 engages with this concept.
127	  

device. SIM cards and most mobile phones have interchangeable slots, so that subscribers can
switch coverage, plans, and devices as they move.

Figure	  6	  -­	  SIM	  card,	  front	  and	  back

The mobile station is the primary node through which users reach other mobile
subscribers in the mobile network, access network coverage, call grounded telephone lines, and
send text messages among other uses. Users can also receive messages from their network
provider. For example, how many minutes they have left to use in their call plan, if their payment
has been received, or if they have voicemail messages waiting to be heard.
Since the early 2000s, some mobile stations have been able to access online Internet
content through technologies like Wireless Application Protocol through a mobile interface to
web content (though many have argued that WAP was a resounding failure for early mobile
internet services). The WAP standard made use of higher bandwidth networks, and HTML5,
enabling websites to be optimized for viewing on smaller screens of mobile phones. Since then,
mobile operating systems for smart phones have begun to rely on “apps” or small applications to
connect to Internet content. Instead of using browsers, apps provide access to limited kinds of
128	  

online information in corridors (for example movie show times, traffic updates, or weather
reports). There are also mobile apps that don’t reside on the phone but use SMS clients (e.g.
daily horoscope text). Most mobile phone users in the world do not yet have smart phones (insert
estimate), yet feature phones have become incredibly powerful, and the ITU (2013) estimates
that by 2014 active mobile handsets will reach more than 90% of the world’s population. The
Pew Research Global Attitudes Projects forecasts that all new Internet users in coming decades
will adopt the Internet through mobile networks because mobile phones are nearly ubiquitous
nations that are still “offline” (Wike & Oats, 2014).
Mobile stations have operating systems that structure how we interact with our phones,
how we input entries through the keyboard, how we receive information through the LCD screen
and so on. Mobile operating systems, like operating systems on personal computers, process,
structure and access data on the RAM and ROM memory. Unlike personal computers however,
mobile operating systems spend less time storing, and more power processing and running many
operations at once, more time and power processing radio transmissions through the network.
The mobile operating system and user interface structure our experience of what we can do with
our phones, but they also influence our perceptions of mobile network coverage, which is both
varied and hard to pin down. Wirelessness as an affordance of mobility leads to different ways of
locating constraint, limits, and blackouts of mobile network coverage. However, our experiences
of wireless networks are instead tethered to the power of network speeds and processing power
of mobile devices.
In addition to the information that we can transmit and access through the network, our
mobile phones increasingly allow us to do small daily tasks that involve scheduling,
maintenance, and especially time management that do not depend on network access or
129	  

coverage. The memory on the phone and operating system usually store a limited amount of
phone numbers in the address book application, alarm clocks and timers, and simple calendars.
Incidentally, though, users cannot go beneath the interface of the mobile operating system
(Brown & Duguid, 2002). Mobile operating systems (like many operating systems on personal
computers) don’t let you program your own recordkeeping decisions, they enforce a certain
amount of constraint that is especially subservient to processing and storage space because of the
limited amount of local storage on the phone.
Mobile applications on smart phones present interesting implications for privacy, data
formats, and personal digital traces because it’s not totally clear how accessing traffic data is
used by the applications that we use and access. Increasingly with smart phones, mobile network
providers such as Verizon or T-Mobile work with equipment providers to create “skins” or a
layer on top of Android of Symbian that involve their own apps that users are required to use.
These data are enrolled in user feedback programs. Privacy experts find that these proprietary
factory installed apps often have less permission and turn over more personal information to the
equipment manufacturer. Typical privacy terms of service for downloaded and factory set
applications involve sharing your usage, location data, and power with service providers, handset
manufacturers, application developers and more. Despite the principle that record creators own
the traces they create, the usage patterns, data analytics, and recorded information behavior are
shared or co-owned as parts of terms of service with service providers, handset manufacturers,
and mobile operating system designers. This kind of co-ownership by sharing usage patterns is
yet another kind of networked personal trace that is yoked to mobile service providers.
As noted earlier, a mobile station must be compatible with a network provider in order to
make use of mobile network coverage. Mobile network infrastructure, including standards and
130	  

protocol deserves some more engagement to understand how texts are received. The way that
mobile network providers provide cell coverage to subscribers in their network is through cell
towers (that create coverage by sending and receiving radio transmissions) and service centers
and base stations. While users primarily interact with their devices, most of us are also familiar
with cell towers that structure our landscapes (Parks, 2007). Cell towers are laid out in urban and
rural areas to create coverage, towers overlap each other and overlay like patches on a quilt.
Seams of coverage exist in a variety of interesting places that are often unincorporated,
unmanaged, or have few official residents like national parks or desert landscapes. It’s worth
noting that the punctuation of cell towers in our landscape that supports the quilt of coverage that
at times appears seamless is often unevenly distributed and partial. See for example network
converge maps between service providers. Often these seams of coverage highlight existing or
emerging economic and infrastructural inequities in urban or rural environments, contributing to
another kind of digital divide built upon wireless access through mobile network coverage
instead of broadband Internet access.
The transceivers that support network coverage are connected to service centers with
servers that retrieve information from subscriber databases about switching and handing over
data transmissions (whether that be voice or text transmission) to other subscribers in the
network. These service centers are interoperable and have billing and handoff procedures if a
subscriber sends a text message to a user outside of the originating sender’s network provider.
Built on top of all this physical infrastructure is a suite of telecommunication standards and
protocols, code and policies, technical principles, that make the sending and reception of
messages and calls possible. Telecom protocols, such as GSM, CDMA, or 3GPP take years
(some times decades develop) and roll out, they also need buy in from equipment manufactures,
131	  

telecom companies and mobile network providers, and nation states that govern the broadcast
spectrum that mobile networks use. In each of these nodes of the network, metadata is constantly
created and generated as part of network coverage and data reception. These mobile telephony
metadata are generated in support and as part of transmitting text messages. Text messages, like
all records, are metadata encapsulated objects. However, mobile telephony metadata, its
collection, and leverage in aggregate are still becoming (McKemmish, 1994).36 The next section
discusses the relationship between content, context (captured through metadata and information
behavior), and storage of text messages.

Deletion, Storage, Memory
In addition to the creation and transmission of these records, their deletion, storage and memory
are at stake and shape our personal records, and our information management practices. Users,
system designers and handset manufacturers are still negotiating the limited storage capacity of
first generation feature phones and now smartphones. And still further, the cloud storage back-up
for devices that we use today to circulate traces often limit our ability to store, retrieve and
archive records. Increasingly, we internalize the technical limits and affordances of our mobile
devices. For example, psychologists have found that many users experience phantom rings--the
belief that their phone is ringing or buzzing when it isn’t. Other social scientists have found that
users feel anxious or insecure with they leave the house without their phones, or when a phone
runs low on power. Users also internalize their phone’s storage capacity by working around,
improvising and performing with its limited memory and processing capacities.

Sue McKemmish (1994) explores the transactionality and contextuality of records, which are
“always in a state of becoming” in “Are records ever actual?” The Records Continuum, 187-203.
See chapter 2 on the records continuum and for more on this idea of records becoming.
132	  

In her book The Breakup 2.0: Disconnecting Over New Media (2010), anthropologist
Ilana Gershon discusses the complexities of electronic communication, the material limits of
digital media, and social networking interfaces. Differing structures of media provide better ways
of saving, retrieving, or extending conversations, whether to continue on a fight, to flirt without
face-to-face rejection, or to share and discuss with friends later. Gershon found that
undergraduates use the limited storage capacity of their mobile phones to negotiate evidence of
relationships beginning and ending. She describes an interview with a woman named Summer
about her decision to break up with her boyfriend:

Summer: […] After a while, it was “What the hell am I doing with him?” And I saved the
texts that we got into an argument about. I started deleting all the good ones that he sent
me, and I started saving highlights of the bad ones. The ones that he sent that really really
hurt me, I would save all those…And when it gets to this point of number of texts, then I
know that definitely it is time to break up. That kind of thing. When it gets to that number
of texts, because this is like ridiculous.
Ilana: What number?
Summer: My phone says like a hundred or whatever, but I don’t know how much it
actually holds.
(Gershon, 2010, p. 108)

In Summer’s case, her mobile phone can hold about 100 text messages in her inbox; she decides
that after a certain amount of hurtful messages the limit of the phone’s storage coincides with her
limits of being in a relationship with her boyfriend. Summer makes a conscious effort over time
133	  

to curate her texts. She manages, edits down “highlights” of conversation threads, and eventually
deletes text messages from her boyfriend. The ability to store, save, and delete text messages
shapes Summer’s relationship, her breakup is an example of embodying the material limits of the
local storage/flash memory of her phone. Just as it enables connection through sending and
receiving text messages, the limited space of the phone’s memory allows her to gather, appraise,
and curate enough evidence to disconnect from a primary relationship.
As mobile devices come equipped with more memory, users’ curatorial practices are
shifting the ways in which they relate to the digital materiality of phone storage and collection of
mobile media. The stakes of use now govern the authenticity, preservation and future access to
traces created or received via mobile devices. Increasingly, mobile operating systems have autodelete features for text messaging, so that users rely on the device to manage and delete such
traces of communication. Smartphone users can thus rely on the phone’s operating system to
weed out “threads” of texts automatically. For example, Android version 2.3.6 “delete(s) old
messages as limits are reached” (e.g. Figure 7). The default limit is 200 messages per
conversation with another user. One may change and expand the limit to 5000 messages per
conversation on this version of Android, but with noticeably sluggish results if more than 1000
messages are stored in a thread. Such default storage settings manage the longest threads of text
messages with frightening precision—the longer the thread is, the sooner it will be deleted. The
factory setting appears to be efficient for frequent texters: the more texts a user has from another
person, the longer it takes to load that specific conversation thread. The auto-delete setting
ostensibly makes room for more messages through deletion under the aegis of increased
processing efficiency.

134	  

Figure	  7	  -­	  Auto-­delete	  settings	  for	  Android	  3.5.2

The shift from curating inboxes and outboxes to relying on operating systems indicates a
change of state for mobile records and information management with personal digital collections.
And this leads us to ask, what does it mean to store? How do data structures and settings in the
operating system change our intentions and willingness to store, save and curate future
collections? This question asked of personal communication in mobile computing means
something different then in business and legal contexts, as storing is shifting. Especially as these
personal records, ephemeral messages are becoming enrolled in business communication
networks as official records. In this way we can think about it in terms of the operating system
that governs the ability to store and later retrieve. There are layers involved in saving, at the level
of ingest, capture, inscription, storage, and later retrieval that involve more inscriptions. At each
layer is a state of change, a point of transaction where a boundary is crossed over. In digital
environments, boundary crossings may result in multiple copies, inscriptions, points of storage.
For example, with cloud storage, we may have local storage on multiple machines and backup
135	  

copies stored on a service provider’s servers. Saving involves updating and storing traces at
multiple points, distributed across many boundaries including platform functions, software and
hardware.
Automatic deletion gives rise to another notion about whether anything can actually be
collected and archived in the digital era. Some conflicting ideas about evidence and materiality
appear in discussions of digital collections. On the one hand, there is a pervasive perception that
anything created in digital form will last forever, and this has to do ideas about copies, storage,
and the power of the digital. On the other hand, there is the belief that digital things are fleeting,
ephemeral and always shifting. We can also consider it from an alternative pose, that of the
enduring ephemeral (Chun, 2012) that relies on traces in aggregate stored in many places. These
devices are fragile, crash, or can be lost at any moment—they can be dropped in the toilet, or a
malware on an app can crash the operating system, the phone can be stolen or the hinges or
buttons wear out. There is a sense that the mobile phone’s storage itself is limited to the internal
memory of the device. Precisely because of its portability is its poison and cure. The mobility is
a quality of its vulnerability to storage because it’s not locked away in the basement as most
records and databases. A safe space, and iron mountain of storage for retrieval.
The ability to be continuously connected necessitates a feeling of always already being
able to retrieve, except for when the phone disappears/is damaged a network reaches limits (as it
requires a tremendous amount of processing power, energy and coordination to access traces in
the cloud from mobile networks with your phone). There is also the idea that the internal storage
on the phone is not enough, it is limited, it is too small. And this idea pervades and is felt by the
actual limits of the mobile operating system combined with the internal memory storage of the
phone. For example, early handsets could only hold twenty to thirty address contacts in the
136	  

phone book, later phones could hold hundreds of address contacts but a limited amount of
photographs or mobile video.
Increasingly the storage on phones is expanding, but the processing power and the mobile
operating system and data networks add more layers to the ability of the machine to store, access
and retrieve more information, more documents. So can anything be saved created with phones
for an archival collection? Yes and no.
In the first sense, the only way to save it is to stop using the phone. The more traces
create the likelihood of more traces being overwritten, deleted, lost. The second answer is no, the
mobility afforded by the phone, the immediate access provides the user with no reasonable
expectation that the information should last more than a few days or weeks. Americans go
through new phones every two years, they may go through as many more data networks,
contracts, and billing plans as well. This includes the storage memory within the devices. I argue
that the ability to move and access the network, create and transmit information forfeits the
expectation of long term storage in an meaningful sense, or at least in an archival sense. We can
fetishize the device, and keep it, treasure the user experiences of the interface. Or we can
privilege the traces being created that are gathered up and then unbound each time we get a new
device and change the SIM card. We can also talk about SIM cards as a kind of removable
storage that carries important data from phone to phone, sloughing off data and losing it as more
is overwritten.
The discourse of having access to everything, or total recall, relies upon a third kind of
storage. An ideal storage where the user curates what is collected in context and that is
transferred to another platform, devices or memory paradigm that involves transferring it,
breaking it out of the mobile device through upload, convergence, backup, creation and

management. We see that many consumer grade content management systems are pushing in this
direction; for example if I plug my camera into my MacOS to upload my photos to my iPhoto
program on my personal machine, I am prompted to share and connect my photos to Flickr the
cloud based storage, photo platform. This process takes the photos from the storage on my
phone, copies it to my personal computer into the iPhoto library data storage structure and then
uploads the photos to the cloud based storage service and social networking platform where my
photo sharing account is subject to a host of terms of service for storing and accessing my photos
for retrieval at a later date. This process of backup is fraught with copies, tags, metadata, terms
of service, and distributed storage memory (device, pc, database, cloud storage).
So, can you ever save anything? Can mobile digital traces actually be collected into
personal archives? Depends on the way you frame the expectations of memory and storage. If,
for example, you are looking for the archival notion of storage for preservation, that it is unlikely
at this time as text messages are still not seen as conceptual, physical, but only as logical, digital
objects. If, instead, you are interested in the memory of flash storage, then possibly, but this kind
of saving with this memory is device specific, and there are layers of encapsulation that depend
on variables like the operating system, the messaging application, the make and model of the
handset, the power CPU processing power. The lifetime of most handsets of is 5 years before the
CPU, DSP, battery or screen wear out because of such heavy, daily use. If you are in a memory
transfer paradigm, where you want to transfer it to another storage medium, data structure and
storage system then possibly, you can save text messages. But like many device specific formats
this type of collecting and preservation involves active and constant curation in terms of
emulation or format migration. In many ways, the promise of saving everything isn’t actually
interesting as the ways that forgetting and appraisal are changing with the constant collection of

infrastructure and vendors.

Some problems with Personal Digital Collections and Mobile Media
There has been little research on the ways in which digital records are moved, accessed, and
stored across distributed wireless and mobile networks; they can be complex, unstructured,
software dependent and often difficult to reproduce. The two most fundamental principles in
archival science: provenance and original order are based upon the ideas of keeping records
together in an organic bunch, the “tissue” of records (archival bond). And Provenance, which is
preserving the chronology of custody that the records came in. While original order has to do
with how records were created, commenced (used and circulated), and eventually became
inactive. Provenance has to do with the evidence stored in between records, a layer above the
layer. While original order preserves the evidence as whole corpora. Given the rapid device turnover, messaging client settings, and limited storage settings on mobile phones, ideas about
provenance and original order in personal digital collections made of media are shaken up,
broken, insufficient.
What does the respect des fonds for a mobile device look like? What does it mean for the
traces (context and content) created with a messaging client? I may keep the same address book,
and those contacts may grow and shift, but in all likelihood I will always have a few people that I
text over the course of my lifetime. For example, my Mom, my sister and best friend from
college. If text messages are saved, as are correspondence in personal archives what would that
look like? How should these collection be appraised, accessed, collected? And further, what are
the contextual layers, organic and above the texts themselves that are worthy to look at? How has
139	  

reception changed with born networked records like text messages? The blank text messages and
even batch deletions turn ideas about collecting records and the evidence that they reveal upside
down. As Richard Cox (2010) has argued that while, “[c]ollecting has played an important role
in forming what archivists do, [it] has played havoc with systematic or standardized approaches
to the management of archival records” (p. 208). The principles of archives, acquisitions,
collecting, appraisal and selection have shifted with networked record creating environments.
There is a large body of research in archival science that addresses conceptual definitions
of records in electronic, networked environments beginning in the 1990s (Akmon et al 2011,
Botticelli 2000, Cook 1994, Galloway 2009, Hedstrom 1997, Henry 1998), however few
approaches account for the digital materiality of electronic records or their transmission in
mobile or wireless transmission. And while archivists have always confronted loss and decay as
records have moved across space and time, transmission and the ubiquity of mobile phones
represent a shift in the present and future of electronic records as well as archiving mobile
communication. The problem with wireless handsets and their mobile records for creators and
stewards of digital archives are their contexts of production, transmission and storage. Is it a
record once it is stored? What of records stored in many places (phone, SIM, service provider
cloud backup, third-party application’s servers)? The limited memory and storage capacity of
mobile devices is in conflict with earlier regimes of media storage and evidence because of the
stuff that makes their mobility possible, the infrastructure of transmission and their digital
materiality. The traces of transmission created as part of records creation (like a sent text
message) may become separated, and become another kind of business record on its own. There
may be conflicts in collecting that result in a new, networked archival bond.

140	  

The Archival Bond and Telephony Metadata
The collecting practices and strategies that make up digital collections are a way of getting at the
materiality of digital traces. Archivists use formal elements in recordkeeping to determine the
identity and integrity of records, in order to see if they qualify for preservation, whether they are
analog or digital. We start by describing the technological environment in which the records
exist, and then analyze their documentary representations within a given information system.
Archival science focuses upon bodies of records, or records in aggregate to appraise for
preservation. When a record is put into relation with other records it carries context and can be
placed in an archival bond. The archival bond is the “core” of archival science: the concept is
originary to every record’s creation. In being set aside for further reference, it becomes part of
the “connective tissue that joins a record to those surrounding it” (Duranti, 1997, p. 217). The
archival bond thus shapes and carries the contextual meaning that a record bears as part of a
collection. Increasingly the bond of metadata has become more valuable than the content of
individual records. Metadata is being leveraged in state surveillance contexts in aggregate to
predict terrorism, locate targets and interpret content (Office of Inspector General, 2009).
Historically, metadata in Library and Information Science has referred to information
retrieval systems such as catalogues and classification systems. With mobile phones and data
networks, metadata is called “telephony metadata”. Telephony metadata is both structural and
contextual because as standard formats dictate the way systems must decode data packets like
text messages, further, these metadata are contextual because it involves personal information
such as geolocation in a cell network, the SIM, IEMI number. Telephony metadata has been
given a lot of attention in the last few months because of the news that a secret court has been
collecting “telephony metadata” from Verizon business solutions (Greenwald, 2013). Mobile
141	  

telephony metadata has become more and more complex and layered, as we have transitioned
from 2G networks to 3G networks that use Internet Protocol to transmit data. It is worth noting
that that has to do with how the wireless data is transmitted over the air and through
infrastructure and how wireless data and recorded telephonic voice data has been governed in
earlier paradigms by the US legal system (Landau, 2014). For the intelligence community,
aggregated metadata is valued over content, but for archivists, the quotidian collection is
valuable as a standalone object, or fonds. Increasingly we are seeing collections of metadata take
on organic bonds of context.
Without criteria for a bond that accounts for the networked transmission and for appraisal
of metadata we risk “the older antiquarian tradition of collection for collection’s sake becomes
the guiding principle” (Cox, 2010, p. 210). We need to change ideas about archival collecting
and keep apace with other kinds of collection contexts (individual lives but also in new
information institutions like telecommunication providers). Another change is that digital
collections are both individual and institutional as we create records with platforms and where
content intermediaries govern the formats, terms of service, and storage. We know that fonds is a
core abstraction to the study of records collections, “the fonds cannot be treated as a clearly
bounded category (Lee, 2011, p. 33), instead it is a living organic thing. How is the archival bond
determined in this new era?
This conflict can be seen in ideas about appraisal, or the process of selecting what records
are worth keeping, and what records should be lost. We know from 20th century archival theories
about appraisal that “the practices determination of primary use value is notoriously difficult and
[the] precise determination of secondary value is simply impossible” (Lee, 2011, p. 51). And yet
in this era of big data, there is rhetoric that these personal data and their secondary uses will be
142	  

more valuable that we know (boyd & Crawford, 2013). We also see conflicts in appraisal with
government records—what should be preserved and what should be deleted. For example the
litigation of the National Archive’s appraisal of emails related to Iran Contra affair (Steinwall,
1986) Despite these apparent conflicts in appraisal which guide collections we haven’t
considered how the archival bond changes with these new kinds of records that are born digital
but also created and used in networks, fonds cannot be created?
In their research on connections between Personal Information Management (PIM) and
archives, Lee and Capra (2011) write that practitioners in PIM, records management, and
archival science have not adequately addressed the desirability of disposing information that is
no longer needed (pp. 55-56). Yet the destruction of records has a long history in public records
management (Leahy, 1940) and had legal protections in many European countries by the
nineteenth century (Lee & Capra, 2011, p. 54). Moreover, Terry Cook (2011) famously argued,
“appraisal is the only archival function” (p. 3). Keep everything approaches that belie the rhetoric
of big data analytics that promise a vast fonds that many sociologists of the Internet have been
quick to critique. However a lack of attention to these metadata generation and collection
practices suggest the need for developing new archival appraisal criteria for metadata in the first
place, and systematic approaches to the collection and generation of metadata created as part of
mobile media like text messaging. In the next chapter I examine a few cases where the creation
and circulation of metadata shapes the nature of collections, it aims to show some of the conflicts
and roles that these defining power takes. I argue that the stabilization of mobile telephony
metadata is a social process that archivists and information technologists can influence in this
moment.

Chapter 5: Traces of Transmission: Metadata and Collecting Futures

Abstract: This chapter illustrates how the generation, circulation, and collection of mobile
telephony metadata represents a new form of collecting for institutions, under the law, and for
the theory and practice of archival science. It describes a few current case studies where the
definition and common understandings of mobile telephony metadata is unstable, shifting, and
stabilizing. It argues that new contexts of metadata creation and collection has led to a mobile
forensic imaginary based on the infrastructure and transmission of born-networked records
created with mobile ICTs.

Keywords: born-networked records, mobile forensic imagination

Texts from States
On 21 January 2014, thousands of mobile phone users in and around the area of Independent
square in Kiev, Ukraine received the following text message, “Dear Subscriber, you are
registered as a participant in a mass disturbance” from an unknown number identified as 111
(Hooton, 2014). The three main mobile service providers in Ukraine, Kyivstar, MTS and Life,
deny turning over subscriber data to the government or sending mass text messages in the capital
during the protests (Kramer, 2014). The Ukrainian interior ministry denied sending the mass text
as well. One service provider admitted that “pirate towers” are known to exist and were likely
used to send the text messages. Policy analysts and journalists emphasized the use of the phrase
151	  

“mass disturbance” in the text as new laws recently went into effect in Ukraine for participating
in public protests (Walker & Grytsenko, 2014). Indeed, the mass text message that was
reportedly received by protestors, bystanders, and first responders alike, was probably a cell
broadcast text message sent by an independent (or usurped) cell transceiver in or near
Independent square.
Cell broadcast text messages are part of the GSM standard known as the Short Message
Service-Cell Broadcast (SMS-CB) (3GPP TS 23.041, 2013). They are received like any other
text message, but are transmitted using local broadcast technology and not through cellular
network coverage. The SMS-CB is a one-to-many transmission protocol that allows a sender to
transmit SMS messages to all powered-on mobile devices active within a particular range of a
single base transceiver station (or cell tower). In GSM cellular networks, each cell has a unique
signaling channel that can be used to send SMS-CB across the air interface. SMS-CB text
messages are transmitted across a cell broadcast channel that is a unique signaling channel to a
single cell tower, instead of being handed-off through a network of cells.
The cell broadcast text message sent to protestors and bystanders in the Ukraine
represents a significant moment in the stabilization and standardization of “text messages” as a
formatted electronic record. First, a blast of text messages to mobile phones users in a particular
area is known as a cell broadcast text message because it’s broadcasted, it’s not a two-way
transmission like most text messages that are used by individual users. It represents a one-way
communication with no call set up for receivers to send back text messages to the sender. It
depends on a cell tower that can send SMS messages to all devices in a particular cell, within a
particular range of coverage, depending on the landscape and the amount of devices in the area.

152	  

The motivation behind broadcast text messages is particularly tied to location, and especially to
people who are carrying mobile phones and happen to be occupying specific places.
Cell broadcast text messages are often used by government institutions in the US, Mexico
and in Japan for weather warnings, earthquakes or tornadoes. They are usually operationalized as
warning messages, sent to people in particular places, to motivate evacuation or alerting people
to a disaster. For the people in Kiev, Ukraine, this particular cell broadcast text is interesting
because it has not been claimed by a sender, and further, the content of the text message itself
implies data collection about the subscriber (“you have been registered”), but the service
providers with the customer records to create such contact-chaining deny cooperation. The
potential for total registration is particularly chilling. Although the technology of the cell
broadcast text cannot gather information about subscribers, cell towers on their own gather
information from active handsets that can be gleaned when they ping the transceiver, reporting
location and the amount of mobile users moving in and out of cell. This kind of information
collected within cells can be incredibly powerful, but it’s hard to individualize without customer
records like SIM cards or IEMI numbers (Blaze, 2010). The transceiver can gather a fair amount
of data about the terminals in the cell (number of mobile phones), and how fast they are moving
in and out of the cell. However, without supporting two way transmission, a limited about of
information can be ingested, and aggregated usefully without a mobile service provider’s home
location register (HLR), SIM numbers of subscribers, and IMEI numbers of devices connected to
the network. It remains unlikely that mobile users were actually registered with information from
their mobile devices without a cooperating service provider turning over customer records. The
chilling effect of the message plays on the purchase of the possibility of metadata collection or

153	  

aggregation, service providers cooperating with the state, and the future uses of such metadata in
different ways (e.g., prosecution for protesting or participating in dissent in a public space).
The situation in the Ukraine remains unstable and continues to unfold with Crimea voting
to secede from the Ukraine in a referendum that Western governments have called a sham and
illegal. While the use of broadcast text messages during protest that are unclear and imply statesponsored messages of suppression is salient, it’s not particularly not unique to oppressive
regimes or even democracies. Many gaffes with cell broadcast and other kinds of group text
messages from states involving subscribers as citizens (or undocumented residents), their
location, and personally identifying information, have appeared all over the world in the last 20
months. In October of 2013, the Home Office in the United Kingdom hired a third party
company Capita to send 39,100 text messages to people living in the UK who may not have the
right to live in the country. The text messages read, “Message from the UK Border Agency. You
are required to leave the UK as you no longer have right to remain” (Wintour, 2013). Many
citizens reported receiving the text messages mistakenly, still others received hoax messages that
were threatening, and further, the controversial campaign itself was overwhelmed with thousands
of imposters who texted back the immigration hotline about voluntarily leaving (Hope, 2013).
Hundreds of people who are legal residents reported mistakenly receiving the text message to
leave the UK. According to an investigative report, only 11 people left the country voluntarily as
a result of the Home Office immigration campaign, two-thirds of the people who received ‘go
home’ texts turned out to be fakes (Travis, 2013).
Mass text messages from states to citizen subjects, or from contractors who may pose as
speaking for the state, perforce discussions about the collection and creation of mobile telephony
metadata as records—and how to classify them, are they business, state, or individual records?
154	  

What does it mean when states and citizens use text messages and their subsequent metadata as
records? How does mobile telephony metadata become records independent of content? As I
have argued, sending, and receiving text messages in this century is to engage with the problems
and anxieties about complete digital archival collections of metadata. This includes personal
digital archives created with mobile devices and professionally delineated archives that are made
up of electronic records for legal requirements or for posterity. Complete digital archival
collections of metadata are possible, and emerging, but have yet to be an object of interest
outside small niche groups of mostly corporate data enthusiasts like social media technologists
(like Mark Zuckerberg), big data evangelists, quantified selfers (like Gordon Bell), and privacy
scholars. In each of these cases, the collection of metadata is at question, it is both a poison and
cure to the future of efficient information management. For this discussion, it is important to
scale back and locate where (and why) metadata is generated, because it is conceived as a
fundamental part of the store and forward architecture of mobile networks, as seen by archivists
and records managers as a way to examine the contexts of records including the structure of their
creation, and as new kinds of business records in corporations and under the law—they also
represent digital evidence in new networking contexts.
Individuals and organizations create records to conduct business, to make decisions, and
to keep track of decisions that have been made. Records are used for accountability within
organizations, accountability under the law or with business communication policies and prove
when events or transactions between parties occur. Collections of records also give people and
institutions the ability to protect their rights and assets in legal, financial or regulatory
environments. Records also protect people—citizens and consumers, as records can enable
transparency and protect our rights. Formal archival collections of records are created for
155	  

posterity, ensuring their access and use for cultural, historical or research purposes. Increasingly
however, with digital records, collections are being created in ways that rupture traditional ideas
about the preservation of individual or community identity. They also disrupt historic models of
records management like the life cycle model and some have argued, the records continuum
model as well (see Chapter 2). For example, text messages and their subsequent metadata are
becoming enrolled into business record keeping contexts and in some cases becoming new kinds
of government records without consumers or creators knowing, or they become collected in
corporate or surveillance contexts, but consumers themselves may not have the tools to collect
text messages themselves.
In chapter 3 I wrote about the mobile telephony metadata that is created as part of the
sending and receiving of text messages that originated on a user’s mobile device, and as part of
the transmission through a service provider’s network. I argued that mobile telephony metadata
is both structural and descriptive, providing incredible resolution and unique information about
mobile phone users (de Montjoye et al., 2013). This chapter will connect parts from chapters 2,
3, and 4 by exploring the emerging role that telephony metadata is playing in contexts of
collected mobile digital records as traces of transmission, in legal and surveillance contexts,
including how it is seen as a communication tool for heads of state like President Barack Obama.
It argues that mobile telephony metadata represents new challenges and opportunities for
archival science and studies of infrastructure in information studies.
First, I present an overview of some recent cases in the US where policy and legislation
have expanded and enrolled text messages, call detail records, and mobile telephony metadata as
electronic communications, including the Presidential Records Act, section 215 from the USA
Patriot Act, the Inspector General’s report leaked by Edward Snowden, and some current bills
156	  

that aim to limit the collection of metadata in surveillance, as well as some bills that have died in
congress that aim to preserve electronic messages (as distinct from metadata). I want to put these
parts together and suggest that ideas about metadata, especially how they are operationalized and
understood in circulation are part of a sea change in archives and the future of collections. I focus
on the points of intersection that I have described in earlier chapters that emphasize elements of
the framework I presented in chapter 2 especially as they related to engagements with user
practice, layers of infrastructure and new contexts of information retrieval.

Why is Mobile Telephony Metadata Different?
In the last chapter I wrote about the ways that text messages are enacted and created as metadata
encapsulated objects (Bearman, 1996) and that collected telephony metadata in aggregate are
unlike personal data collections because they are based on transmissions between two or many
parties (including receivers, service providers, platforms, and multiple networks). I wrote about
how the contents of messages are created by users and then interpreted by readers, messaging
clients, users, designers, and states in different ways, some are still even unfolding. Metadata is
evidence of the distributed materiality of text messages across mobile networks, as well as
different collection contexts. Telephony metadata is used and protected in different ways under
the law. In this chapter I want to connect these different ways and show how they change ideas
about collections, ingest, appraisal and storage. How is mobile telephony metadata its own kind
of content as traces of transmission?
Metadata is becoming more important than the content of messages we send by virtue of
its inevitable and constant creation and collection as part of mobile telephony, but also because
of its aggregation into collections that can be queried and interrogated over time to predict and
157	  

analyze actions. I argue that it is the ability to network them together, as part of their creation and
structure that makes metadata a new kind of organizing principle for archivists to confront. What
are the stakes of collecting it? I start with the basic idea that records and metadata are now
ingested all the time as part of the infrastructures of creation, transmission, and access, in
particular with our mobile devices through mobile network coverage. While there are many laws
that govern security, privacy, and retention of telephone communications, the ways in which we
use and interpret them are primarily based on stationary telephones. Until quite recently, most
telephones sat on desks or were attached to walls, on the bedside table or in the kitchen. Now
phones are carried on our bodies and do more than support voice telephony—they transmit and
capture rich data not only about text messages, but also about the users, in a variety of ways.
Explaining the stakes of those mobile telephony metadata is the goal for the remainder of this
chapter. Metadata circulation and collection provides a particularly interesting case for the future
of archives and the status or primacy of the record as an organizing principle in modern archival
science, theory, and practice. If modern collecting institutions move towards collecting and
aggregating metadata instead of traditional business record groups, how will our theories catch
up?
Remember, SMS was originally designed as an optional add-on service for service
providers and manufacturers to support with early mobile telephony (Hillebrand, 2002, p. 79,
GSM4 162/190). But by end of 1990 GSM4 Liaison decided it would be a mandatory teleservice
(SMG4 23/92). This decision to make it a mandatory service is seen as the success of the service
because all mobile phones could send and receive SMS by 1994. The unified GSM standards and
technology allowed for infrastructure to support the use and availability of wireless
communication, but also the potential for data transmission like text messages. Kasesniemi
158	  

argues that the spread of GSM enabled the birth of the text messaging culture, which could not
have emerged without the technological innovation of SMS, which itself “was originally
designed for an entirely different purpose” (Kasesniemi 2003, p. 94). Now texting is used in
business, government, development, banking and beyond. In many contexts the metadata of their
use and transmission becomes more important than the content on its own. Throughout the
chapter I will engage with leaked NSA documents and their connections to ideas about collection
in existing policy because we know content is being collected (including from US persons).
Concepts I describe include: mobile forensic imaginary and born-networked records. These
examples underscore the political, juridical and archival consequences of metadata definitions
and what those definitions do in this moment. I am historicizing metadata of text messages and
mapping its political and archival implications.
In June 2013, Glen Greenwald of The Guardian reported that call data records or
“telephony metadata” from American Verizon subscribers was being handed over to the NSA
under secret FISA court orders. According to the leaked court order, all of Verizon’s telephony
metadata and all other transactional data related to communications metadata were turned over in
bulk to the NSA on a daily basis. Many members of Congress and representatives from the
Obama administration came forward to claim that this kind of metadata is not personal because
the information being gathered is not the actual content of voice calls, but instead minimally
personally identifying information. The New York Times (Savage et al., 2013) quoted Senator
Saxby Chambliss from Georgia saying, “It’s metadata only and it’s what we call minimized.”
Senator Chambliss’s statement was repeated over and over in ways to diminish the significance
of what metadata in bulk might actually mean for US citizens. Congress, political pundits, and
the media defined telephony metadata as benign for the rest of the summer, often likening it to
159	  

the information found in a telephone book. Metadata, and the way it is defined, depends upon
theoretical commitments to frameworks of surveillance, information access, and ideas about
belonging. The ways we define it and the power it can have necessarily conditions and shapes
the information (and the people) that are represented by it. After agitation from privacy activists
and technologists in light of more leaked documents from Edward Snowden to Greenwald, it
became clear that the telephone book definition of metadata belied the importance of mobile
infrastructure and wireless transmission of personal information.
The differences between telephony metadata and mobile telephony metadata were hashed
out in the media for the rest of the summer and fall of 2013. Most of these differences focused
upon the capacities of mobile handsets and the traces that they create in support of voice and data
transmission, especially call data records. Call data records that mobile phones generate include
information ranging from location, time, length of transmission, and information about other
phones a user may try to connect through a voice call or text message (for example their phone
number or service provider). Call data records also include unique identifying information about
users and their phones such as the SIM card and the International Mobile Equipment Identity
(IMEI) number for mobile handsets. Swaths of metadata are created each time you use your
phone to connect to a mobile network and place a call, check your email, or send a text message.
Mobile telephony metadata is also created and collected whenever phones are powered down or
powered on, as they are tracked by the closest cell tower.
Metadata is a powerful concept that has been used to justify and defend many domestic
surveillance programs based on the collection and aggregation of communications data. A
diluted definition of metadata was being used by the Obama administration and the NSA in the
summer of 2013 to obviate the significance of what this data from mobile phones actually is and
160	  

how this information being handed over to the federal government by mobile service providers is
understood by Americans who use cell phones and create metadata everyday. According to Tom
Boellstorff in his study on the making of big data, “[a]ttempts to depoliticize metadata hinged on
assuming a self-evident, distinction between data and metadata”(2014). Telephonic metadata is
quickly becoming the most private information that we have because mobile phones are
increasingly our primary communication tools, and the significance of these digital traces is
being overlooked because the “meta” prefix. Boellstorff has argued that the prefix subsumes a
tension, a tension that hasn’t been resolved and involves the implementation of power, and
identity. We can also argue that there have been discursive junctures when “mobile” as
descriptive term has been dropped from explanations of telephony metadata, and that it too, has
significant effect on the power of the idea that is being circulated.
The formal definition of “metadata” in the field of Library and Information Science is
“data about data” (Greenberg, 2005). For archives, metadata is known as structure data about
data, as provenance and original order are both information about the structure of record creation
and aggregation. Metadata can be structural or descriptive information about content, and it helps
people find things in information systems. Structural metadata is information about things to help
us find things in systems, for example the address to your house refers to a building on a street in
a grid somewhere in some place. Descriptive metadata is lots of pieces of information (think
“breadcrumbs”) about a thing, so that when it presents itself to you, you can identify as the right
thing you are looking for. The information on your drivers license about your height, weight, age
and hair color that identifies you as a person is descriptive metadata. Historically, catalogs in
libraries have been the most common instances of metadata. The catalog numbers on the spines
of books are structural metadata, because they help us find books on shelves. While catalog
161	  

records that describe what books are about, their contents, what they look like, and where they
were published are descriptive metadata. In tandem, structural and descriptive metadata can
create powerful access and retrieval systems. In the information age, metadata is all around us
and is used in almost every encounter we have with technology, other people, and things. It is the
information we need to describe, find and analyze information objects in the world. As metadata
becomes a ubiquitous part of modern life, it becomes something that we encounter and create in
everyday living. We need metadata for our bus routes, traffic lights, banking systems, e-mail,
and health records.
Increasingly, metadata can be generated and gathered through small sensors in our
environments, ranging from RFID chips in passports to turnstiles in parking garages. These
sensors generate information, and data about that information can be deduced in powerful and
expansive ways. How many people have passed through this checkpoint? How many cars are in
this parking lot? How many trucks are on this freeway? One of the most ubiquitous forms of
metadata that we can create as individuals is with our mobile phones. Currently, more than 85%
of Americans carry phones, and the Pew Internet & American Life Project (2013) has found that
more than half of those users carry smart phones, which generate more detailed call data records
than feature phones. Like bankcards and drivers licenses, we carry our phones all day in public
and in private places. Most users keep their mobile phones powered on for most of the day. But
unlike the choice between using a bankcard or cash, we do not have choices about what traces
we can leave, how they are tracked, if we want to use these traces and now, since the USA
Patriot Act, how these structural and descriptive metadata can be enrolled in domestic
surveillance programs.

162	  

When mobile phone users have control over the metadata that they collect and then share
it, it is called participatory sensing (Acker et al., 2010), or sometimes souveillance. Participatory
sensing data from phones can be used by people for many good and empowering reasons and it
relies on a faceted understanding of what data traces can be generated and how they relate to
privacy. For example, there have been many participatory sensing projects at UCLA that give
community members the opportunity to collect environmental data from their phones and make
arguments about the neighborhoods around them, such as finding less congested bike routes to
commute to work (Goldman et al., 2009). When people use participatory sensing to generate and
collect data about individual movements, location, and communication with their phones we find
that they are concerned about confidentiality and security of their personal metadata (Shilton,
2009).
The problem with the minimized “data about data” definition that has been used in
defense of NSA surveillance program that collects metadata in bulk is the difficulty of
connecting telephonic metadata to the everyday uses of carrying a mobile phone that is almost
always creating and generating digital traces. The way that metadata is currently being explained
to citizen subjects and to mobile subscribers denies the powerful kind of sensemaking that can
happen when structural and descriptive information becomes “meta” and then gets enrolled in
big data projects like domestic surveillance programs, or when the information about these data
has to do with your movements, location, and primary communication contacts. Metadata from
our phones that has been accumulated over time can tell personal things about actions with
precision, for example how often we shop, when we go through the drive through for fast food,
where we live, where our loved ones live, how and where we spend our nights and weekends.
When mobile telephony metadata is aggregated from small groups of individuals through
163	  

contact-chaining, many more things can be inferred about how groups of people interact and
move around in their communities.
Deploying sensemaking information from the metadata collected from thousands of
mobile phone users can be very powerful in different collection contexts. It can be even more
powerful when it relies on a simplified understanding of metadata that overlooks the unique,
personally identifying aspects of sensors in our lives, such as phones that broadcast our location
or the duration of conversations between people. Accumulated metadata from mobile phones has
possibilities that we are still discovering (Willason, 2003; Willassen, 2005; Glisson et al., 2011).
It is important that we understand that the definition of metadata is not without consequences, it
is not benign and that mobile telephonic metadata is unlike any other metadata that has ever
come before because it is both personally descriptive and structural. A complex and
comprehensive understanding of ownership over our call data records is needed because they
constitute expectations of privacy from both our mobile service providers and government
records over time. The creation and collection of metadata for surveillance becomes in
Boellstorff’s words (2014), a “form of belonging” in this surveillance state. In order to confront
the power of how definitions of metadata are deployed, we must engage with the motivations for
collection. Historicizing and rethinking the terms of collections of metadata (instead of records),
will uncover what it collecting means with wireless infrastructure and mobile technologies.
Historicizing it can also help us imagine what resistance to these cultural logics of control might
actually be.

The Shift from Business Records to Collections of Metadata
In chapter 2 I wrote about Kurt Mix, a BP project engineer who was convicted of obstructing
evidence by destroying text messages related to the course of business in the Top Kill oil spill
project. The Department of Justice found that the text messages that Mix had exchanged with his
supervisor over the course of 2010 were indeed part of the course of regular activities related to
the business of stopping the oil spill. As of this writing, Mix continues to appeal his case based
on juror misconduct and the interpretation of text message content as business records (Krauss,
2013).
The International Council on Archives defines records as having context, content and
structure (Committee on Electronic Records, 1997, p. 22), however the formal definition of
business record and the inclusion of text messages as part of this definition has a significant
impact on the future of metadata collections, but also business communications at the turn of this
century. Business records are documents that are created as part of regular business activities,
historically these records are pretty well understood, however with digital technologies and the
proliferation of social computing platforms, new genres of records are pushing the limits of what
is and isn’t a business record.
According to the Federal Rules of Evidence business records include things such as, “[a]
memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions,
opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person
with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the
regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record or data
compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witnesses”
(Federal Rules of Evidence 804 §6). In general, business records must satisfy four qualities from
165	  

a juridical standpoint (Skupsky & Mantaa, 1994): the record must be created near the time of the
event that it records, it must be created or transmitted by a person with direct knowledge of the
event, it should be created as part of regular business activities, and the making of records must
be part of the regular practices of the business (p. 23-24). The definition of when a business
transaction or event occurs has been influenced by the rise of mobile devices and mobile network
coverage that afford an always-on, always available connections to workers and their employers.
What is significant about Mix’s conviction is that it isn’t the content of the text messages,
but instead the evidence of curation and the metadata that was collected to show that these text
messages were business records because of who and when he was texting. We know from
scholars of business information technology, like JoAnne Yates, that communication technology
like the telephone, telegraph and the telex fundamentally changed the recordkeeping and formal
communications practices of business and governance in the 19th century. As a format, text
messages provide an entry point into the history of communication networks of the late 20th
century, but it also tells us something about the significance of digital collections in this moment
as they shift from analog or formal business records to collections of metadata and in particular
mobile telephony metadata. It also shows a shift of where business records can be created and
stored, including personal devices like mobile phones. The lesson to learn here is that as mobile
ICTs become increasingly relied upon to communicate and create records, we need to consider
the shifts in collecting (and deleting) digital traces in our culture that are tied to these mobile
devices, their platforms, and the infrastructure of mobile network coverage. And moreover, what
this mode of positioning does for traditional understandings of records and recordkeeping
contexts.

166	  

Positioned as we are with always on devices, telephony metadata influences the
organizational logics of control and communication, and saving or deleting texts becomes an
exercise of self regulation as a worker in the information economy, curating texts is at once
underestimated by design settings and features in messaging clients, and then over-relied upon in
business recordkeeping contexts as part of what Ian Bogost (2013) and other feminist labor
thinkers have addressed as the part of hyper-employment effects of mobile technologies
(Gregory, 2013). If you always carry your mobile device, you always-already have the potential
to be creating business records that are subject to discovery, collection, and retention, wherever
you may be located whether that’s at work, lunch break, at home, on the road, and so on.
Throughout this dissertation I have written about how the limited storage capacity on
mobile devices combined with the design constraints of messaging clients on mobile operating
systems keep users from collecting and preserving their own text messages over time. Users,
their devices, and even their service providers do not actively collect text messages for very long
periods (under the ECPA of 1996, they must be destroyed within a reasonable amount of time to
protect telephonic communications privacy). In addition to the content of text messages, the
lion’s share of data collected by service providers is the metadata that is constantly generated as
part of supporting mobile telephony teleservices. I am arguing here that metadata collections, if
not already, will become the new organizing principle or concern of archives and collections of
information institutions. Metadata collections also turn businesses like mobile service providers
into new kinds of collecting institutions, with different expectations and goals for stewardship
than traditional collecting institutions like libraries, archives, and museums. We will move past
collecting and archiving the content of records, or groups of records, and instead, begin to
support vast metadata collections as businesses are quickly becoming new kinds of information
167	  

collecting institutions—collecting metadata as business records, and harnessing that big data for
predictive analytics.
We are seeing the ascendency of metadata collections transformed into business records
with the new role that mobile service providers play in state surveillance programs, in addition to
the course of providing data transmission with 3G and 4G networks. For example, Senator
Markey’s (2014) annual inquiry on the wireless surveillance of Americans has found that all
seven leading mobile service providers in the US have turned over user’s cell phone records,
including metadata ranging from CDRs, geolocation data, call lists, and the content of text
messages themselves. Where before mobile service providers were primarily responsible for
rendering transmission services (such as connecting calls, transmitting text messages, holding
voicemail alerts), they now have stores of information that when interrogated, aggregated, and
queried represent new kinds of “wholes” of collections for inquiry. In this way, we see collection
of mobile telephony metadata outpacing the evidential value of the content of text messages
themselves as individual records or record groups created by individuals, and see them as
networked collections of records. You may ask, how can this metadata be used meaningfully?
Simply, it can be used for contact chaining to build up information about groups of people and
their habits. Where they meet, how they move through spaces, where they go during different
times of the week, and most importantly where and what they buy and consume. In June,
Snowden leaked the Inspector General’s report, which remains the only real published rationale
for the NSA collecting Internet and mobile telephony metadata in bulk under project “Stellar
Wind” (Office of the Inspector General, 2009). From the report, metadata and collection is
outlined:

168	  

The authority to collect bulk telephony and Internet metadata significantly enhanced
NSA's ability to identify activity that may have been terrorist-related. Contact chaining is
the process of building a network graph that models the communication (e-mail,
telephony, etc.) patterns of targeted entities (people, organizations, etc.) and their
associates from the communications sent or received by the targets." Metadata is data that
describes other data, specifically information that describes the content.
(Office of the Inspector General, 2009, p. 15).

Boellstorff argues that the implicit histories in the prefix of meta “expand frameworks,
addressing time, context, and power” meaning that the data and primacy in the context of
creation is always tied to the temporal formation, in addition to the structural and technical
processes that shape metadata. As you might imagine, the law has not kept up with the power of
technology, and it is still tied to immobile telephones and their metadata, and as privacy theorist
Susan Landau (2103) has written, “the law provides less protection for metadata than for
content” (p. 57). In 1976 Archivist Lester Cappon lamented the holes that telephone
conversations would leave in business documentation in the 20th century:

On the archival edge the archivist as collector is confronted with certain dilemmas, not
inherently new in the twentieth century, that are insoluble, to some degree, but open to
accommodation. On the one hand, the quantity of certain records demands measures
wisely to save and to destroy; on the other hand, the paucity of lack of certain records
attributable to telephone communication tempts him to fill the void by creating records
for the service of scholarship.
169	  

(Cappon, 1976.)

It is likely that archivists of the 21st century will lament the lack of holes created by mobile
telephony metadata as part of business communications in this present moment.

Blackberry 1 and the Presidential Records Act
In her book Virtualpolitik (2009), Elizabeth Losh argued that the Bush and Clinton
administrations actively dissuaded citizens from using digital technologies (ranging from filesharing, copying media, to online gaming). The Bush administration also suppressed and
changed the ways digital technologies would be used in circulating communications in the White
House. In 2008, Judith Butler argued that it would be Obama’s “dis-identification” with the Bush
Administration that drive his popularity and allure, centered on his use of digital technologies
and social media. In contrast to Bush and Clinton, President Obama during his campaigns and
presidency has made use of many social media technologies and Web 2.0 platforms, using what
Henry Jenkins (2006) calls participatory culture to his advantage and connecting with
constituents. During his election campaigns, candidate Obama was often seen using his
BlackBerry or an iPod, and once he became president-elect, was quoted as saying, “I’m still
clinging to my BlackBerry. They’re going to pry from my hands” (Zeleny, 2009).
But since being in office, as Losh (2012) has crucially noted, President Obama’s use of
his BlackBerry (like his smoking) is only indulged in covert spaces, outdoors, in corridors, away
from “official spaces of statecraft” (p. 258).

170

Office”, photo taken by a White House photographer Pete Souza, The White House, image
available at [http://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/4456732652/] under a Creative Commons
license.

This is in sharp relief to the transparency and records accountability that President Obama began
his administration with. His first order issued on the first day of his presidency, Executive Order
13489 restored the original Presidential Records Act (PRA) of 1978 and revoked Executive
Order 13233 issued by President George W. Bush in 2001, which included the documents of
former vice presidents. The 1978 PRA, 44 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2207, mandates the preservation of
all presidential records and changed the legal status of who owned records, transforming
presidential records from private to public records. The act creates a statutory structure for
171	  

managing records created during presidential administrations. However, Obama’s use of digital
technologies and mobile devices has proven to be a hurdle for the PRA, and it remains to be seen
how his continued use of his BlackBerry and the records he creates with it will be documented
and preserved under the PRA.
Obama’s relationship to his mobile device is as Melissa Mazmanian has argued, a
“relationship [that has] emerged from, and is steeped in, a particular culture in a particular time”
(2009, p. 16). Early media reports of President Obama’s mobile device, called it the “BlackBerry
1” and speculated that the device would unlikely be a Research In Motion (RIM) device, but
instead, likely a Sectéra Edge Device certified by the Department of Defense. General Dynamics
which manufacturers the Sectéra Edge offers two models. One is NSA approved for federal
workers and the other offers consumer-grade high-level encryption that many smart phones do
not provide (LaVallee, 2009). However most evidence, including the official Whitehouse Flickr
photo stream, suggests that the BlackBerry 1 is indeed a BlackBerry model 8830, and continues
to be, despite the fact that Obama is now rarely seen using it. Early attention to the president’s
BlackBerry was upon the security of the device (Harauz & Kaufman, 2009; Sorensen, 2009),
later though; it became clear that problems with email and text messages on the device itself
would be another challenge for federal records managers. The BlackBerry operating system uses
unique encryption and a proprietary messaging format known as the BlackBerry Messenger
(BBM) to send encrypted text messages. Electronic proprietary formats (from word processing
documents, to keynote presentations, to electronic mail) continue to be a thorny issue for the
National Archives and federal electronic records management.
House Resolution (H.R.) 5811 amended title 44 charging the Archivist of the US to
create solutions to preserve email and digital records created during federal agency
172	  

administration, including Presidential records. Bush’s executive order, and the Clinton’s limited
use of electronic messaging, had hemmed in the PRA from actually implementing or creating
solutions to preserve and archive digital communications (because there was a dearth of email
that actually existed). The HR 5811 would implement a “solution [that] must be able to operate
within a Microsoft Windows/Exchange, Storage Area Network and Active Directory
infrastructure. Internet gateways are Unix-based using Sophos, PureMessage for filtering. Client
access is through Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Web Access and Blackberry hand-held devices”
(Miller, 2008). Unfortunately, H.R. 5811 was introduced in the 110th Congress in 2008, passed in
the house and died in the senate.
Similarly, H.R. 1367 also called the Electronic Message Preservation Act, amended the
PRA and would require the national Archivist to certify annually whether electronic records
management controls established by a President meet the requirements of the PRA.
Representative Paul Hodes introduced H.R. 1367 in the 111th Congress in 2009. It passed in the
house and died in the senate in 2010. While the PRA has expanded to now include electronic
devices, servers, and mobile phones that send and receive electronic messages, it remains unclear
whether the Archivist of the US will be able to carry out these duties without bills like H.R. 5811
or H.R. 1367 that layout how the preservation and collection will actually be done at the
technical level. Essentially, the PRA provides a legal mandate to collect and preserve the traces
created with the BlackBerry 1, but there is no legal or technical infrastructure for it to happen
when Obama’s term ends. Moreover, financial issues with RIM have led market forecasters to
predict the demise of the company, as it nearly went bankrupt in 2012 (Savitz, 2012).
Two digital preservation issues that archivists and digital curators face can be seen in the
problems with archiving the BlackBerry 1. First, is that the cost-benefit of keeping the
173	  

president’s proprietary operating system preserved is undue given the likelihood that it will
remain a popular smart phone operating system as the BlackBerry has the smallest marketshare
of the leading mobile operating systems (Tuutti, 2012). Second, migrating the data, or gathering
it from other devices (service provider’s, Whitehouse servers, or other BlackBerry’s or mobile
devices) may be easier and more cost effective than preserving the device itself. Gathering the
metadata traces created by the BlackBerry 1 is easier and cheaper than investing in a proprietary
encrypted format like the BlackBerry Message. The PRA and the two dead Electronic Message
Preservation Acts point to a rupture in the approach to preserving content created with mobile
phones. Many still argue the cost benefit of mutually preserving the Blackberry 1 as a device
itself, instead of preserving the content, migrating, and put all the attention on the metadata.

The Power of Metadata Collection
The documents that Edward Snowden leaked through the Summer of 2013 and even today as I
write this should give us pause to consider the power of the collections of metadata that the US
government currently is creating under the auspices of Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act,
where the NSA has interpreted telephony metadata as business records (Inspector General’s
Report, 2009). While some of these collections come from private citizens in the US, still others,
contain metadata from whole markets, political leaders, and individual citizens from other nation
states.
In one of the first leaks, Snowden claimed that the NSA had access to Chinese
telecommunication networks and millions of text messages, which is the country’s most
preferred communication tool (Lam & Chen, 2013). Despite the ongoing leaks, and President
Obama’s security task force report (2014) the policy, rules, and regulation of this kind of secret
174	  

data collection remain unpublic, and often, overclassified. As Landau (2013) has written, “On
the one hand, we see care in collection (at least for US persons), but on the other, the leaked IG
report is the only public description we have of the purpose behind the NSA’s bulk collection of
communications metadata” (p. 58). A striking dearth of information about the motivations for
what guides these collecting processes is worth thinking about it terms of the kinds of things
collected, but also the power of what can be done once these collections are organically bound
together and networked. For example, researchers who have examined the electronic retention of
mobile phones (Glisson et al., 2011), and telephony metadata (Mayer & Mutchler), have both
found that thousands of artifacts can be recovered through mobile forensics, and that metadata is
“unambiguously sensitive, even in a small population and over a short time window.” Mayer
and Mutchler we were able to infer medical conditions, gun ownership, and more, simply using
aggregated telephony metadata.
The interpretation of Section 215 to include telephony metadata as business records,
which many have argued is a secret law, has led to the bulk collection of telephony metadata
from mobile service providers. This telephony metadata includes data from cell towers, not
simply from GPS (from phones shared with service providers). But also, data to and from cell
towers as we see in the Ukraine case and the UK immigration text case above, is increasingly
powerful for alertness and suppression (Blaze, 2010). Bulk collection of metadata also raises
questions about the distinctions between individuals, communities, and discrete groups of people.
These data are created not only by individuals, but also by service providers. These data are
yoked together, once they are collected in aggregate, it becomes impossible for an individual to
be the primary owner or custodian of that information. Further, the issue of ownership becomes
murky if the US government is collecting it in secret (Landau, p. 58). As metadata is collected it
175	  

binds traces together into organic wholes that we may not know the power of now or in the
future. It also shifts the power of who owns what and when. The power of ingest and appraisal
become fraught with the meaning of context and evidential value—that is, in the arché sense,
what can and cannot be said institutionally, juridically and under the law (Derrida, 1996).
In the US, many legal protections of telephony metadata were developed in the late 1980s
with the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). The ECPA governs the real time
capture of calling data, CDRs, as well as electronic communications that are stored. It is worth
remembering that in late 1980s when the ECPA was passed, telephones didn’t move, they were
stationary communication technologies. They sat on desks, were bolted to walls, in private call
booths, tethered to wirelines and stationary power sources. Moreover, groups of people, small
groups like families, students in dormitories, and people in public places like the library or
university, shared most telephones. Today, mobile phones are carried on bodies, powered on for
most the day and in most countries, on one person throughout the course of their day (though
there are places where mobiles are still used by families, or at the corner store as a payphone).
Part of using a mobile phone also means sharing your mobile metadata with service providers. In
addition to outdated protections on telephony metadata that don’t confront mobility, because
service providers generate, steward, and keep most of the metadata individuals create, it isn’t
subject to the same constitutional protections as content (Landau, 2013, p. 56).
A series of laws have weakened the ownership of metadata and enabled the swift
collection of it, including the 2007 Protect America Act, the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, which
gives telecommunication companies immunity for participating for in warrantless wiretapping,
and Section 215 of USA Patriot ACT that authorizes the collection of business records in bulk.
Now these business records are interpreted by FISA courts and the NSA to include phone
176	  

records and mobile telephony metadata. Since the fall, new bipartisan bills have been prepared
by Patrick Leahy, an architect of the USA Patriot Act, to limit the bulk collection of telephony
metadata by tightening section 215 by instituting formal reviews to prove that targets are “agents
of a foreign power[s]” or are legitimate subjects of investigation (Roberts, 2013). In March,
Representatives Zoe Lofgren, Ted Poe, and Suzan DelBene introduced legislation to modernize
the ECPA with the bill, H.R. 983 (2013), the Online Communications and Geolocation
Protection Act, which requires that the government get a warrant based on probable cause before
intercepting or forcing disclosure of communications from Internet or mobile service providers.
At the time of this writing, it remains unclear whether any of these bipartisan bills will pass.

Encryption, obfuscation, and ephemeral messaging apps and the mobile forensic imaginary
According to Jonathan Sterne (2012), a format denotes a whole range of decisions that affect the
look, feel, experience, and working of a medium, but it also names a set of rules according to
which a technology can operate, not just in the present moment, but in future context. I want to
extend this argument and not only reiterate that histories of formats matter to the preservation,
analysis and circulation of culture in the digital age, but that the history of how SMS came to be
and exists today is a history of how new mobile records operate in the present, and are collected
as well as deleted.
The NSA’s own documents suggest that the agency retains Americans’ communications
indefinitely and that there are no plans for appraisal or weeding. These collections are not merely
for monitoring (that is descriptive information), but for predictive use cases, and according to
many privacy theorists, increasingly prescriptive analytics. Predictive policing models exist and
continue to make use of mobile telephony metadata, amongst other environmental data about
177	  

citizens in particular residential locations (Graham & Winston, 2014). The ubiquity of text
messaging, SMS gateways to the Internet, and the increased use of smartphones has led to what
market forecasters call the next “killer app” in mobile technology development (Kessler, 2013;
Reyburn, 2013): it is the new market of messaging applications (“apps”) that allow users to send
enhanced messages, including video, picture, and text in a variety of new ways with their mobile
devices. With the rise of these new messaging platforms, an increase in ephemeral and selfdestructing mobile communication tools have increased. Many of these new messaging platforms
use next generation mobile networks and Internet Protocol (IP) to transmit messages, encrypt
them, and auto-delete messages shortly after recipients have received them.
As messaging over IP on 3G and 4G networks gains traction, we see it influencing other
markets, like social media and personal computing. For example, Facebook bought WhatsApp
(2013) for $19 billion in February 2014 (Covert, 2014). Shortly afterwards, Bill Gates claimed
that Microsoft would have bought the messaging service too (Gibbs, 2014). As messaging
applications creep into every social media platform, including Twitter, Gmail, and Facebook,
there is a trend towards these applications ensuring encryption, “off-the-record” capabilities, or
complete deletion in the name of privacy and security. The popular tagline for Wickr (2013) is,
“The Internet is forever. Your private communications don’t need to be.” The motto implies that
existing norms don’t give you control over the longevity of your mobile communications data,
but that this messaging app offers the solution.
Messaging apps, including mobile obfuscation apps that ensure encryption and deletion
like Wickr or Backchat (2013), and their valuation and popularity amongst mobile users (ranging
from teenagers to professionals) point to the emergence of a mobile forensic imaginary
surrounding the use, longevity and evidential value of mobile messages. Mobile obfuscation and
178	  

encryption apps that use IP to transmit data over Internet connected mobile networks, unlike call
data channels that SMS uses. The forensic imaginary fueled by these apps at once plays with
ideas of traces in ingest and appraisal in security contexts, but also betrays a move to jettison
long-term evidence with the idea that everything stays on the Internet. Snapchat is billed as a
game, while Confide is advertised as “Snapchat for professionals”. Each messaging app ensures
that your message will be deleted within seconds of it being received.
I argue that we are seeing the emergence of a mobile forensic imagination with the rise of
messaging applications that tout obfuscation or ensure encryption and deletion. For example,
Snapchat and Wickr both play with popular perceptions of the security and longevity of
messages created with mobile devices. The promise of security by way of ephemerality and
complete deletion with new messaging applications points to the emergence of a mobile forensic
imaginary built upon popular understandings (or misunderstandings) of telephony metadata, and
further, how “leaving no mobile traces” supports notions of better lives created with mobile
ICTs. This move towards mobile encryption and deletion can be foreseen in text messages being
deleted, but also in the NSA collection. How does this imaginary motivate use and influence
practices? What are its consequences? Finn Brunton and Helen Nissenbaum (2013) argue that
“computer aggregation changes the nature of contemporary surveillance” (p. 169). The metadata
from mobiles can be combined tougher, yoked, networked with other kinds of data (business,
government, personal records) that have historically been siloed. Once they are combined, these
databases can be pulled, “unprecedented new wholes” (Brunton & Nissenbaum, 2013, p. 169).
For Brunton and Nissenbaum, obfuscation is seen as informational self-defense. This can
also be seen in participatory sensing and organizing with mobile phones. These tactics speak to
the asymmetry that is present in the collection of mobile telephony metadata. The asymmetry of
179	  

this power is that you don’t choose to be monitored; the epistemic is that we are not aware, and
the NSA captures everyone’s. Another level of the asymmetry of this collection is that the ingest
does not have checks for appraisal, technically or judicially, and that metadata, while more
powerful, is less protected under the law than content. Ephemeral messaging apps offer a
solution to something that text messaging clients and mobile operating systems do quite well
with auto-deletion, overwriting, and limited internal storage. Despite their supposed newness,
self-destructing messaging apps address problems of persistence and digital preservation by
simply deleting the content of messages faster. They are halfway technologies “built to solve
problems only half understood” (Sterne, 2007, p. 23). The traces of transmission, or the metadata
that many of these encryption and ephemeral messaging apps create is still stored on phones, and
appears in CDRs.
Metadata collections by business and governments mark a significant cultural shift in the
experience of mediated life with wireless communication and mobile computing. And here I
want to argue that text messages as born-networked records created with mobile infrastructure
represent a significant shift in the criteria of archiving for traditional recordkeepers like
archivists because of the historic commitment to appraisal and weeding as part of the processes
of collecting. These kind of complete collections also have a significant impact on the American
culture, not just of collecting or of personal information management, but of core American myth
of reinvention, based on the dream of starting over (Raley, 2013). The classic American second
act of beginning again and starting over, if your first act is constantly creating traces of
transmission that are collected, indexed and searchable by the state and other corporate actors
while you yourself are deleting traces or have limited access to these records, or knowledge of
how they are being used in aggregate. I think here we can see that there are future directions that
180	  

have far reaching implications for collecting, appraisal, and preservation. The rise of mobile
obfuscation practices, and tools, point to a new kind of mobile forensic imaginary influenced by
the future contexts of metadata in aggregate used by states or corporations through big data
analytics. Explaining the future effects of those on subjectivity is my goal for the remainder of
the chapter.

Data subjects and collection futures
The transmission of text messages creates traces of metadata that represent how we move in
space and the patterns of our everyday lives. Foucault described the disciplinary societies of the
20th century that replaced the sovereign society in the 18th and 19th centuries (1970, 1972). In a
society of continuous control, as Deleuze argues (2010), we are constantly enclosed within the
network; one of the ways we can see this in what Manuel Castells would call “in the space of
flows” at the beginning of the 21st century is with the constant creation of metadata with mobile
devices and its pervasive collection by nation states and private corporations. Subjects cannot
escape the power of surveillance in Foucault’s model of society. For Deleuze, once you locate
circuits of power, it has moved elsewhere. Both provide ways of thinking about the power of
surveillance and control in a networked society however neither engage with the generative
possibilities of surveillance and control through documentation.
While the creation and collection of records about workers and citizens is not entirely
new, some have argued it is fundamentally American to document workers (Jennings et. al,
1996; Yates, 1993; Orlikowski, 2000), the aggregation of metadata that is both personal and
professional (as mobile phones support) through networked platforms changes what collections
are made up of, and transforms the nature of business records to mean almost all metadata
181	  

created with wireless infrastructures. Mobile ICT infrastructure supports born-networked records
in ways that collapse difference, contradicting identities that we may hold and live as workers,
citizens, community members, and individuals. This new kind of subjectivity is built upon the
constant creation of metadata that is enrolled in aggregate in new collections that fall outside the
bounds of traditional collecting institutions like archives, instead they are now networked and
layered in ways that our practices, laws, and technologies are at odds with each other.
For most mobile phone users, the method of transmission and the production of telephony
metadata affect the information being communicated, in the moment and over time. However,
these collections of metadata inscribe us as new kinds of records creators when they are enrolled
and ingested by the state. It is not only a product but also a discursive frame of this moment of
communication, transmission, and collecting. By studying the conditions of the possibility for a
thing to exist like the text message format and its storage, deletion, as it is enrolled in different
memory regimes, whether at moments of creation, transmission, now collection within mobile
communication infrastructure provides us with ways for locating and identifying the changes that
mobile communication traces in personal and institutional digital collections bring. The historical
ontology of mobile records and telephony metadata gives us a renewed opportunity to examine
material traces of new forms and spaces of social and cultural memory created with mobile
devices and wireless infrastructure.
Mobile ICTs support, enforce, and calcify this subjectivity through the traces of
transmission that we create and enrolled apart of as we are “continuously integrated into a larger
information economy and technological apparatus” (Elmer, 2004, p. 17). In this chapter I
identify the asymmetry of collecting metadata, when users are unaware of, or have an outdated
understanding of metadata. We should ask, how does metadata creation and collection
182	  

“transform the basic archival attitudes towards collecting, when everything can be indexed and
sorted at the level of metadata (Cox, 20104, p. 214)? How do we become subjects of and subjects
to these metadata processes? How does this change the nature of the record with the asymmetry
of collection in surveillance contexts, how will notions of evidence change with predictive
analytics? Will exclusive or inclusive definitions of records be useful? How can they be
leveraged? That different actors, from users, to lawyers, lawmakers and surveillance programs,
have incommensurable understandings of the metadata that is captured and leveraged in different
collection contexts points to a shift in the understandings of records, collections, the definitions
of metadata. It also points to the ways we are interpellated by these metadata, in Mark Poster’s
(1996) terms, “a complicated configuration of unconsciousness, indirection, automation, and
absentmindedness” (p. 187). These unstable definitions are evidenced by mobile obfuscation
apps, encryption apps, and the shifting legal and security state. But these conflicting practices
and unstable expectations also point to a mobile forensic imaginary that is fueled by fears of
surveillance state, administrative control over what can and can’t be captured, the unknown
circumstances what can be done with metadata in aggregate or alone is significant for collecting
futures and well as our understandings of belonging to states, communities, and society.
For more than a decade, text messages, and the metadata that is generated as part of
transmission they create as part of their creation collection and circulation have been
increasingly enrolled in a variety of organizational, business, state, and policy contexts—they
represent a shifting landscape between personal communications and transactional business
communications supported with mobile ICTS. These metadata collections also point to a shift in
understandings of metadata as business records. Metadata is a social process that creates subjects,
and this process is materially tied to carrying a mobile device that creates such metadata. For
183	  

example in Afghanistan the national police force receives their paychecks through a customized
M-Pesa money transfer system based on SMS. The reasoning behind the change to SMS payroll
was the large amount of “ghost” officers on the account books picking up paychecks, to the point
where the government wasn’t aware of how many policy officers were actually employed before
2010 because of graft and corruption (Munford, 2010). Police officers themselves did not know
how much they were actually paid by the government because commanding officers would often
skim from subordinates’ paychecks. The metadata that is created and circulated based on the
Afghan national police M-Pesa payroll system not only disappeared the ghost police picking up
paychecks, it legitimates the officers who do get the money transfers, because their mobile
phones ensure money transfer.
What’s most interesting about these records, even text money transfer receipts, is that
within a few days, months or years, most of these text messages will be deleted to make more
space for more incoming texts, overwritten because of mobile operating system device settings,
or simply thrown away or recycled as part of the e-waste we create with rapid device turn over as
I have shown earlier for all users. However, the metadata of transmission of these records will be
aggregated, circulated and networked across systems in both business and state organizations for
indefinite information unknown amounts of time. Broadcast SMS in Independence Square in
Kiev, immigration texts from the Home Office in the UK, and President Obama’s Blackberry 1
provides a particularly interesting case for the future of collections, including professionally
delineated archives for states and businesses. In each of these examples the telephony metadata
becomes a part of the fonds of the record, and can include geographic, inferential and exogenous
information that provides patterns about the intimidate details of people’s lives, whereabouts,
locations and coming and goings. When telephones used to be bolted to the wall there were
184	  

different expectations of privacy, public and private context, with mobile or mobility, the
telephony metadata that we have come to rely upon deepens and expands sometimes in unknown
and hidden ways.
Given the documents that Mr. Snowden leaked over the summer (Greenwald, 2013), and
Senator Markey’s (2014) investigation that found all major mobile providers were providing
customer records to federal law enforcement, amongst others, this is an important moment for us
to engage with the significance of traces of transmission, or what the NSA is calls telephony
metadata in very new, and significant ways not only as archivists and information scientists but
as citizens concerned about privacy, accuracy, and civil liberties in the networked information
age. Histories of networking are tethered to the stabilization of metadata. Yet most descriptions
of metadata focus upon the collection and the reuse of it in secondary perhaps tertiary uses, most
notability in juridical contexts. As I have shown in this chapter, contexts of metadata creation
and conception under the law, can prove to be useful in showing the (dis)junctures or moments
of incommensurability between users, designers, policy makers, and lawyers at points of
conception and generation. Moreover, secondary and tertiary uses of metadata in aggregate are
promised in many consumer analytics and surveillance programs, but are still largely unknown.
Computer scientists, technologists, and privacy researchers continue to warn about the effects of
metadata telephony and the left over traces on mobile devices, how this information can be
collected, and what can be inferred through its structure.
Archivists have been engaging with the significant impact that metadata can have on
description, appraisal, and access since the 1990s. Scholars such as David Bearman (1996),
David Wallace (1993) and Margaret Hedstrom (1993) have shown the unique contributions that
metadata can bring to the future of archives. But I want to argue here that there will soon be, if
185	  

there isn’t already a shift in the criteria that archivists and other record keepers use for collecting
that will be primarily based on metadata, but by constant creation and collection of it by
corporations, nation states, even cultural institutions like schools and universities. Metadata is
seen as less protected under the law, but we can also see under these FISA court orders and
section 215 that the form of transmission, the infrastructure that supports mobile networks and
indeed the protocols of those networks does matter, and we see that the law is struggling to keep
up with the impact of mobile metadata because we don’t have working theories about how
mobility changes current understandings of telephony metadata.
These metadata, or what I call traces of transmission earlier, are governed by
transmission protocols. In his new work Digital Memory and the Archive, Wolfgang Ernst
(2013) writes that increasingly, as primary sources appear on the Internet, or in the network for
immediate information consumption, the real archive on the Internet in the arché sense, or the
origins is in its system of technological protocol (p. 85). Despite these claims that protocol,
decentralization, and transmission matter to the creation and establishment of electronic records,
we still spend a fair amount time reviving analog expectations of business records what records
should be when we confront new forms of metadata.
Throughout the dissertation I called text message metadata, quite purposefully, traces of
transmission. I am using Latour’s definition of digital trace to mean the range of traces we create
and leave behind when we use ICTs that collapse the social, economic, and psychological while
instantly becoming “information” to be rendered and represented in systems (2007). Trace is also
meant to play with ideas about electronic writing, or writing on screens, because since the 1990s
that electronic writing somehow transcends form and that the computer dematerializes the
written trace (Derrida 1996, Poster 1994). Part of this argument is that I’m arguing that these
186	  

mobile phones are pocket computers that we write and read on, meaning just because we can’t
touch these text messages made of bits, doesn’t mean they aren’t stuff, with form and physical
qualities distributed across a material network.
The shift to metadata collections points to new directions for archival scholars and
information researchers to examine significant changes in ingest and appraisal as they are
combined with networked ICTs. That is, service providers that traditionally have supported
transmission and delivery are now becoming record creators in tandem with their users, and de
facto records managers a new kind of business records, which are metadata, created as part of
transmission. Senator Markey’s (2014) inquiry found that these stewards are handing over not
only metadata, geolocation data, call data records, but also the content of text messages, which
we ourselves, and our devices are actively deleting and do not have access to in the future, and
that surveillance programs, and content intermediaries are collecting at staggering rates for big
data analytics.
In her dissertation on the social impact of the BlackBerry, Mazmanian (2009) writes,
“Tools do not determine use, but they may disrupt current patterns of relations. As such, they
affect the evolution of individual ‘selves’ and the character of social worlds. If self, structure,
and society are continuously re-created through interaction, than the nature, record, and vehicle
of that interaction carry great power (p. 17).” We are quickly becoming new kinds of data
subjects with mobile networks and mobile devices as records; this subjectivity is supported by
born networked records as a result of constant creation and collection of metadata. The historical
ontology of these born networked records deserves more attention from archival research and
theory, especially as it relates to appraisal and accountability. Further, mobile communication
infrastructures are worth examining closely and judiciously if we want to document and preserve
187	  

the emergence of this new subjectivity. What is clear, from the stabilization and history of text
messages, is that their appraisal, ingest, and storage as born-networked records are increasingly
complex, and that we need new tools and theories for approaching the practices of deletion and
metadata collection that specifically occur with mobile communication and information
technologies.
What most stories that focus on metadata collection get wrong is the bouleversement of
common definitions that rely on misunderstandings of transmission, analog expectations, or in
comprehending the possible future use cases once metadata has been aggregated over time. This
chapter documents the varied understandings of text traces of transmission, or metadata that
different actors have, use, and stabilize as parts of bigger arguments about digital collections at
the beginning of the 21st century. And what appraisal for born networked records looks like. This
doxa has kept many archives and information scholars envisioning or seeing the future and
present of metadata aggregation for it is right now, and what it will be in coming years of
ubiquitous computing with mobile network coverage and the wireless devices that we carry on
our bodies, that support this new metadata subjectivity and futures of collecting. The discourse
surrounding encryption and obfuscation messaging apps wants us to see the Snowden leaks as a
new kind of metadata subject, where everything is collected and captured. However, archival
science teaches us that the creation of structural metadata and records is in a condition of
modernity. To be true the means, material and the scale may be different with mobile network
infrastructure. But it gives archival scholars a generative moment, a renewal. The critical
purchase of studying mobile information objects as archival able records shows us that the
archive is not particular place with hallowed ground. And further, the archive is not just a
bankrupt concept, associated with nostalgia for the past. It shows us that archive is material, in
188	  

that it has matter and it does batter to the everyday lives of individual subjects in the present and
the future. Studying the social process of metadata creation like the transmission of text
messages reveals the material nature of the trace, the multiple layers and the distributed nature of
these networked material records. The hailing of infrastructure, provides us an archival
consciousness in relation to mobile born networked records that gives users, record creators,
stewards and archivists to think about the generative possibilities that we have and consequences
and future of collections.

Chapter 6: Conclusion: Born Networked Records
This dissertation is a history of the emergence of a new information object. Part of what the story
of the text message as a format does is map a study of the infrastructure of wireless transmission
and examine how that shapes information objects emerging out of mobile ICTs. When I began
the dissertation I was concerned with the staples of context that would be removed as part the
aggregation of groups of records with mobile phones. I was surprised to find that these staples of
context turn out to be quite useful and they are collected in all sorts of ways. These traces of
transmission are becoming the fundamental organizing principle of emerging collections of what
I identify as born networked records. Metadata created in network represents its own kind of
documentation, records of transactions between people, institutions, and cultures. The creation of
new kinds of metadata also points to a shift in the history of recorded information and the ways
we communicate with mobile networks.
One of the problems with telling a history of a new thing that is on the archival edge is
that it represents a kind of boundary work that may not be useful or understandable in this
present moment. But there are a few generalizable results and I want to share them in the next
few pages. First, the ways that standards get made and sorted effect the information objects that
we create and circulate 10 and 20 years later. Reading about standards development is fairly dry
and lonely, but it was truly exciting to find that SMS was originally for machines to read, and not
for people to use as a writing technology. As I’ve written, eerily, we could not know how the
“ugly duckling of the GSM” (as it is known) would transform microfinance, mobile banking,
social media platforms like Twitter or Sina-wiebo, or fundamentally change how we provide
information services during disaster relief. The second thing that this dissertation points to is a
202	  

convergence that we have yet to confront in infrastructure studies, and in archival science, and
that is the cross over from second generation mobile networks to third and fourth generation
mobile networks. This move towards mobile computing, with mobile networks will
fundamentally change the mobile information objects generation and circulated in the future. We
still don’t have very good understandings about how these always-on, always-connected
machines will shape the knowledge that we create, the ways we read and write, and how we will
save those traces. With this work, I have tried to highlight the importance of studying mobile
information objects in library and information science. While the analysis of mobile information
objects is not new to the histories of recorded information and material culture found in libraries,
archives, and museums, many information scholars have yet to really start engaging with the
significance of these mobile machines, their interfaces, and network coverage that will affect
ways we collect and create records in the future. For information professionals, such as
librarians, archivists, digital preservationists, this work represents a call for us to begin the
process of defining metadata generation and collection, network literacy, mobile information
objects, and new kinds of records including born digital and born networked records. This also
involves evaluating the traces that have been and will be preserved and confronting the
possibilities of deletion, objects that resist collection, and the right to forget in an era of big data.
There’s a long history of studying mobile, portable, material culture in applied LIS
studies, such as in print history, conservation science, museum studies, human information
behavior and moving image archives. One thing that I often have to remind myself is that we
have always transmitted, lost, even deleted mobile traces, and further, there’s nothing inherently
“new” about mobile information objects in LIS. We have always had mobile, portable
information devices that carry evidence of transactions that communicate culture across time and
203	  

space. Consider cuneiform tablets, girdle books from the 13th century, or ladies handfans, even
metal fasteners, which I wrote about in the introduction.
So what makes the study of mobile information objects coming out of mobile ICTs
different than earlier eras of mobile information objects? For me, and for other mobile
communication and information scholars, it’s about the information landscape that is shaped by
network coverage and produced by access to mobile networks. Simply put, carrying a mobile
phone means carrying access to network coverage and this changes how we create, circulate and
record our culture. When we carry mobile devices with network coverage our experiences of
information landscapes change, and the possibilities of what we can do with mobile phones
transforms in a variety of ways, from everyday life to surveillance programs. Moreover, network
coverage presents some really sticky questions for those of us concerned with digital traces,
because traces of metadata are constantly created in order to support the potential connections
and more traces that mobile devices can create. Increasingly we are developing a new kind of
network literacy that is embedded in how we see the potentialities of these always-on, alwaysconnected devices.
Rich Ling (2012) has recently written about the ways we take our phones for granted. We
use them all the time; they are the first screens we look at in the morning and the last screens we
look at night. People have been documented sleep texting and experiencing phantom rings alerts
for calls and texts that haven’t arrived. Many of us feel anxious if we forget our phones at home
or if the battery runs out before we can get back. I argue that these effects are from a new kind of
network literacy that are folded into the daily patterns of our lives, they have become apart of
what Anthony Giddens (1991) calls our “ontology of security”. Early definitions of network
literacy meant the ability to “identify, access and use electronic information from the network,”
204	  

but increasingly, as phones become taken for granted and the penetration rate of use comes
closer to 100%, I want to argue that the definition should expand to include the tacit experiences
of connection; including the potentialities of transmitting metadata with mobile networks
(McClure 1997, ITU 2013). That is, our definition of network literacy should include ideas and
possibilities that being connected to the network affords, not just consuming information in the
network, but the potential of creating and accessing more records and traces of transmission.
Mobile phones produce information landscapes just as they allow us to read the
boundaries of networks and the coverage they provide, so this new kind of network literacy not
only includes how mobile network infrastructure supports record making, but the ways we
construct recordkeeping and cultures of collection in the 21st century. This includes the traces of
transmission that are collected for surveillance and big data analytics. In order for mobile
networks to provide coverage our mobile devices is constantly creating metadata, or traces of
transmission, about your location and what your doing with the phone so that service providers
can provide seamless access.
Increasingly, metadata, the ties that bind the content together is becoming the organizing
principle of collections in the digital age. I described how these traces of transmission, these
staples of context, are just as important as the content and semantic structure of these records that
we create and receive with our mobile devices. We not only need basic ideas about how
computers and the Internet work, we also need to expand these competencies to understand how
our mobile phones (which are indeed pocket computers) and how mobile network coverage
works.

Contributions to the field
This dissertation tells the story of a format and asked some questions about what it means to
create records with mobile devices, transmit them across wireless networks, and collect them.
In the second chapter I outline a framework for how to approach electronic records in
infrastructure. I try to get past the debate of asking “what is a record?” when we encounter a new
technology and ask, “when is a record?” when we use this new technology. This question isn’t
just important for mobile ICTs, this framework can be applied to almost anything, and probably
should be used by archival scholars, because lots of ink, paper, energy, and disc space is being
used up trying to answer what is a record in new digital environments. The framework for
locating records in wireless infrastructure focuses upon three elements, including how they all fit
together. The first element looks at layers of infrastructure. The second element is to look at
device practice or use, how people actually create these things, how are the used, understood and
operationalized as formatted digital objects, and the last part of the framework focuses upon new
information retrieval contexts. This framework can be applied to many digital records moving
through infrastructure, and I hope to continue to apply it in research questions in the future.
In the third chapter on SMS standards, I asked yesterday the question, “How did SMS
come to be?” I wanted to know how standards are developed and how they influence the creation
of formats. The third chapter tells the history of the standard SMS teleservice, the transmission
protocol and how it came to be. Including, how the standards protocol and network architecture
create this new digital format that is a metadata encapsulated object. The third chapter is one of
the first accounts of how human readers are written in and out of the SMS data transmission
protocol, and establishes the significance of the two-way transmission. It also points to a history
that could have been—one where mobile users do not use messaging clients for textual messages
between other people, but instead a machine to machine protocol.
206	  

In the fourth chapter, I asked a question of the systems that we use today, “How are
text messages created, used, sent and deleted with our devices?” I especially focus upon how the
format is enacted at the sites of creation and reception and in device messaging clients. It shows
how users create and receive these traces as things. These findings demand an archival
engagement with the various people who are involved in creating, collecting and designing
messaging clients on mobile operating systems. Part of this engagement should begin by
historicizing and rethinking personal digital collections and the fonds that are a result of
telephony metadata and wireless transmission.
In the fifth chapter, I ask a question for tomorrow, “What will collections be?” It shows
how users, governments and service providers understand text messages and how their accounts
are in conflict, commensurate or likely to change. Bringing metadata, which is one of the most
historical principles of LIS, to the foreground presents an opportunity for next steps and future
work that will look at how obfuscation occurs politically and ethically under the law. It also
illustrates how this asymmetry of metadata collection is changing our relationship to moral
actors like states and corporations. Appraisal was a 20th century archival invention created to deal
with the overflow of information. We need to reinsert it, and find generative strategies for
resistance and change, as the mobile obfuscation, encryption and ephemeral messaging apps
attempt to do. In the last chapter I aim to show how metadata creation is a social process, and
how power, information and the individual record creators come together in specific times and
places with different infrastructures.
This era of mobile communication has significance not only for how we create lines of
inquiry, ask questions, and enable policy, but how we think culture is fundamentally recorded
and collected in the third millennium. The text message as a new format is a kind of incunabula
207	  

for mobile communication and provides a lens for which to see this change. The digital
distributed materiality of text messages presents another way for us to think about this, the
content is being deleted and subsumed but the metadata of these texts are being leveraged in
different ways that is asymmetrical to the point where users themselves don’t even know how it
is being collected and how it is being used, and still further we know that databases and
information retrieval is becoming more and more powerful. My framework can also be applied
in different contexts, not just mobile computing contexts but for social media, for digital records,
and studying how groups of people organize around metadata
This dissertation represents boundary work where I am bringing techniques from media
archaeology and infrastructure studies to examine an archival object of inquiry and then reinsert
ideas from archives back into the study of infrastructure and new information objects that are
stabilized as formats. I’m excited to think about what these changes will mean for the relevancy
and impact of archival studies. . This kind of work is a matter of negotiating the new
opportunities and challenges that new information and communication technologies bring to
archiving culture. Format histories, such as this, represent a valuable intervention into traditional
archival theories but also into studies of infrastructure, system design, and the history of
communication technologies.

Future work
The argument I have made here, then, concerns the future of text messages and mobile telephony
metadata in collections as they are networked. My concern with these born networked records is
less about the content of this new format and more about the processes of transmission of texts
becoming, stabilized and standardized into a format. We need to remember old debates
208	  

about records based on the assumption that transactions give rise to stable ideas about evidence,
but at the same time disinter the ways in which infrastructures of transmission shape recorded
information, in the moment and over time as collections of structured metadata. This involves
giving an account that is itself historical, of how metadata happens, what is happening now to the
collections that record creators and institutions do with these traces of transmission: including
how we think, communicate, remember and archive. A discussion of how new formats are born
networked records forces contemplation of the archive, which, as both an actual place and
everyday experience, tells us a great deal about the present and future impact of mobile
communication technologies on collection futures. And as this work ends, the future work
begins.
