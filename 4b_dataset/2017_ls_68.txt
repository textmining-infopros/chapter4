ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION

A Study of Information Seeking Behavior: Investigating
Exploratory Behavior in Physical & Online Spaces

by Dongho Choi
Dissertation Director: Chirag Shah, Ph.D.

An individual has their own behavioral patterns that exhibit commonalities over different contexts and situations. Several studies have shown (1) dichotomic human mobility patterns in
everyday life such as returner vs. explorer, (2) the analogy of the “Explorer” and the “Web
Explorer,” and (3) the same brain structure used during both physical and online navigation.
Meanwhile, modern technologies such as smart phones and wearable devices have allowed
researchers to collect users’ personal, contextual, and cognitive information and to create behavioral models from different perspectives. Based on the analogy between the physical and
online searching, this dissertation investigates individuals’ behaviors during online and physical search tasks to identify their behavioral patterns. To observe the behaviors, during web
search task and physical search games, 31 participants’ data was collected via eye-tracker, web
browser, and wearable video recorder. Analysis of the behavioral data suggests individuals
have preferred searching strategy that they adopt in different tasks and environments. The behavioral pattern, however, was found to be affected by the task type and the way information is
structured in the environments.

Introduction

You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself in any direction
you choose.
Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss GeiselSeuss
(1990))

1.1

Background

Picture an infant in her crib. Perhaps crying, she uses on only her eyes to find her mom resting
on a nearby bed. Seeing is one of the most important and basic ways to perceive surroundings,
understand environments, and gather information. At least for the baby, seeing is the most
primitive way to obtain information from her surroundings. In this regard, when considering
the intention of this behavior, seeing, it is not surprising that ancient people thought the visual
perception of a human being is accomplished by rays of light emitted by the eyes; Plato held
a theory named “extramission theory,” related to visual perception (Wong and Kwen, 2005).
This theory has been replaced by “intromission theory,” in which the visual perception comes
from “something representative of the object entering the eye,” which later turned out to be
rays of light reflected from the object (Wong and Kwen, 2005). What matters in both theories,
regardless of truth, is the intentionality and related decision-making concerning what and why
people see.
Another behavior that has the same purpose is visiting places - perceiving surroundings,
understanding environments, and seeking information. From the perspective of human information interaction (HII), we can argue that information is all over the place and some part of

2

it is captured by our cognitive system, just as rays of light fill our eyes regardless of whether
we actually see the full potential of what they reveal. In this regard, seeing and visiting are the
primary ways of exploration in information space, both in physical and online settings.
Meanwhile, human information behavior (HIB) refers to several types of informationrelated behavior in different levels and contexts. While Wilson (1999) explains human information behavior with an integrated model of information behavior, information seeking behavior,
and information search behavior, several behavioral models have been suggested to understand
and explain people’s information seeking/searching behavior. Kuhlthau’s information search
process (ISP) model (Kuhlthau, 1991, 1993, 2004) defines the stages of information seeking
that include the exploration stage in which the person seeks and investigates information regarding their information needs. In her berrypicking model, Bates (1989) conceptualizes information searchers as explorers in an information space. Information foraging theory (IFT)
(Pirolli and Card, 1995; Pirolli, 2007) considers searching to be a series of visits to different
information patches that reside in a sub-hierarchy of an information space and allow searchers
to obtain fruits, or found information. Exploratory behavior, as one aspect of human behavior,
spans various types of action, as shown in Figure 1.1.

Figure 1.1: Exploratory behavior in human behavior as well as in information behavior. The
outer circle that presents human behavior and the oval of exploratory behavior are added onto
Wilson’s nested model (Wilson, 1999).
Regarding the exploration behavior, people show unique, distinct, but habitual behavioral

3

patterns in different contexts. For instance, Pappalardo et al. (2015b) examine people’s geographical exploration data to find a dichotomy in human mobility: returners vs. explorers.
Along the same line, Web browsing behavior also presents similar patterns in users’ online
exploration (Barbosa et al., 2016). An fMRI study (Benn et al., 2015) that shows people use
similar brain structures throughout both physical and online contexts (see Figure 1.2) provides
some hints to understand the similar human navigating behavior that occurs in both types of
space.

Problem Statement

As increasingly diverse facets of human life are mediated by information technology, our general behavior and corresponding experience is manifested in mingled reality of various contexts
and environments we are interacting with. In the meantime, human behaviors that are captured
by multimodal sensors have been studied from different perspectives. Previous studies utilized
people’s daily life signals, building human behavioral models to predict outcomes in different
contexts, such as social patterns (Eagle and Pentland, 2006), spending behavior (Singh et al.,
2013), and personality (de Montjoye et al., 2013).
Regarding information seeking contexts, Barbosa et al. (2016) investigated people’s Web
browsing history to find out similar visitation patterns - returners and explorers - to that revealed
in mobility patterns (Pappalardo et al., 2015b). However, their work did not examine behavior
of the same individuals, comparing exploratory behavior in web searching and geographical

4

exploration. Choi et al. (2016) discovered relationships between geographical exploration and
information seeking behavior of the same population, but their work still lacked ways to (1)
connect people’s exploratory behavior in online and physical space, and (2) understand the
contexts and purposes of visitations that have specific goals. There has been little research, to
the best of my knowledge, on investigating searching behavior in goal-driven tasks, comparing
the ways of interacting with online and physical environment.
In this regard, the main goals of the dissertation are: (1) to examine people’s searching behavior in online and physical space, (2) to identify behavioral patterns of searching and exploration in different information spaces, and (3) to find interconnections between those behaviors.

1.3

Significance of the Study

In this section, I present the significance of the study: (1) methodology that captures different
aspects of information search behavior in different information spaces and (2) finding out the
interconnections between online search and physical search.

1.3.1

Methodology

One contribution of my dissertation is to develop new methods through which we observe individuals’ information seeking behavior in online and physical information spaces. The newly
proposed method in this research, a treasure hunt game, is designed to understand individuals’ searching activities in a building, simulating similar search tasks in web environment.
Inspired by the concept of information patches, which is suggested in information foraging
theory (Pirolli and Card, 1997), the game consists of (1) different types of information patches
that we encounter in ordinary places in our daily life and (2) tasks that require participants
to search and navigate the clues and information to accomplish them. To monitor searching
behavior happening in both spaces, this dissertation utilized unobtrusive, passive sensors such
as plugin installed in Web browser and portable video recorder that participants wear during
the experiment. The methodology can be applied to other studies of how people interact with
information in onilne, virtual, and physical environments in general.

5

1.3.2

Searching in Online and Physical Space

When it comes to the applications of this kind of research that examines personal behavioral
traits using passive sensors, Shmueli et al. (2014) mention three directions of research: sensing,
understanding, and shaping (social) behavior. In this sense, the results of this research can be
used in three ways: (1) understanding individuals’ distinct search patterns and (2) helping them
feel satisfied when interacting with information interfaces, and (3) supporting individuals to
achieve better outcomes.
The interrelationship between searching behavior in online and physical space found in
this dissertation can be applied for personalization of user experience or interface design. For
instance, identifying that a user tends to under-explore during search tasks could be used to
customize the way in which the person interacts with information in a virtual reality (VR) environment. When a user’s Web search behavior indicates that they are an ‘under-explorer,’ a
VR interface can adjust to their preference to see and visit fewer places, or areas of interest.
As opposed to other users, the ‘under-explorer’ is presented with simpler filters and a shorter
menu if the task is suited to a rough investigation. However, if said user needs more serious
examination to accomplish a task, the system may intervene and force them to focus on necessary material in the information space and spend much less time looking at extraneous things
(see Figure 1.3).

1.4

Summary

This chapter presented the background of this dissertation, identified a lack of knowledge regarding searching behavior in different domains, and then followed the motivations of why
pursuing further research on this specific research problem is of importance. The problem I am
addressing is the lack of understanding of whether a person presents a similar behavior seeking
information in online and physical space.
The next chapter will discuss the related work and past research conducted in the relevant
areas important to addressing the research problem in detail.

Chapter 2
Literature Review

The current literature review attempts to understand information behavior related to exploration
and searching behavior. Previous studies reveal behavioral traits and different factors that have
been examined to explain these phenomena. Since the concept of information behavior in this
dissertation is focused on investigating how people interact with information and the environment in different contexts, an introduction to a general overview of theories and models about
information behavior will first be provided.
Next, there will be a review of behavioral models and styles in physical and online explorations. Following this, the next sections discuss previous studies on searching behavior in
different domains.
Finally, I will present preliminary work that inspired this dissertation.

2.1

Interacting with Information

This section reviews several models that describe human information behavior, the human processor model that focuses on a cognitive aspect of a human when interacting with information,
information seeking/searching process frameworks, and information foraging theory.

2.1.1

Human Information Behavior (HIB) Models

Ingwersen (1996) proposed that each act of information processing is influenced by a system
of categories and concepts that constitutes a world model with a cognitive point of view based
on the concept of polyrepresentation (See Figure 2.1). The concept of polyrepresentation refers
to an individual’s cognitive space and methods of representation of the information objects in
the information space. The model consists of three main components: information object (e.g.,
text, pictures, and models), the intermediary (cognitive space and social environment around

8

the person), and the information space (information resources) of the IR system. Ingwersen
argues that the functions of each of these components are the results of cognitive models of the
domain of interest.

Figure 2.1: Cognitive model of IR interaction. Copied from Ingwersen (1996).

While Ingwersen (1996) considered the information process from the cognitive perspective
on information retrieval (IR) theory, Savolainen (1995) proposed the concept of the everyday
life information seeking (ELIS), regarding information seeking behavior in “nonwork” environments. The framework mainly consists of way of life and mastery of life (See Figure 2.2).
The ‘way of life’ concept was inspired by Bourdieu’s idea of habitus (Bourdieu, 1984), or
individuals’ “socially and culturally” determined systems of thinking, perception, and evaluation. In this sense, while way of life describes the internalized ‘order of things,’ mastery of life
represents the actions - or activities - that ‘keep things in order’ during tumultuous or threatening times. These two elements interact with each other to (re)form individuals’ information
behavior patterns.
Wilson (1997) suggested a revised version of the information behavior model, incorporating theories from a variety of disciplines such as decision-making, psychology, innovation,
health communication, and consumer research. The model attempted to include several factors,
or mechanisms, that explain whether particular needs invoke information seeking behavior and

9

10

why an individual prefers specific information sources as well as certain intervening variables.
Showing the relations between information behavior models, Wilson (1999) proposed to integrate the models into a more general framework (see Figure 2.3).

Figure 2.3: Wilson’s nested model. Copied from Wilson (1999).
When it comes to user modeling in IR, Sutcliffe and Ennis (1998) suggested a user model
of information searching activities and knowledge sources with query formulations and reformulations as the core components. They realized that query formulation/reformulation is one
of the main activities in an IR process, and the complexity of query formulation is affected by
the complexity of the IR system and the user’s query generating skills.

2.1.2

Model Human Processor

Regarding the cognitive system that governs and decides human behaviors, Card et al. (1983)
proposed a cognitive model of the user - named the model human processor (Figure 2.4) - that
provides a framework from which to predict user performance and to evaluate different kinds
of interfaces for information tasks.
The model human processor comprised three interacting systems - perceptual, cognitive,
and motor systems - each of which has its own memory and processor. As a very simplified

11

Figure 2.4: The Model Human Processor. Copied from Card et al. (1983).

12

model that shows how the system is evaluated, Card et al. (1983) developed a set of predictive
models, collectively referred to as GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules),
that focused on designing and analyzing interactive systems.

2.1.3

Seeking/Searching Process

Ellis and colleagues proposed a set of eight features that form a framework for information
seeking behavior (Ellis, 1989; Ellis et al., 1993; Ellis and Haugan, 1997). Differentiating the
information seeking patterns of scientists and engineers in regard to their information environments, Ellis and Haugan (1997) introduced the eight features as follows: (1) starting: initial activities such as conducting a literature overview or locating key people working in the
field; (2) chaining: following footnotes and references in known material or proceeding in personal networks; (3) browsing: variably directed and structured scanning of information sources;
(4) differentiating: filtering the information obtained using known differences in information
sources; (5) monitoring: regularly following developments in a field via formal and informal
channels and sources; (6) extracting: selectively identifying relevant material in an information
source; (7) verifying: checking the accuracy of information; and (8) finding: activities finishing
the information seeking process.
While most information seeking situations can be characterized by the Ellis model, the
model does not capture undirected processes such as browsing (Bates, 2002). Choo et al.
(2000) proposed a model of online information seeking that includes browsing and searching. The model showed that much of Ellis’s model and feature sets can be implemented as
Web browser components, and thus explains the information seeking processes in Web environments. Searchers begin at a Web site (starting), follow links to information sources (chaining), bookmark pages (differentiating), subscribe to services that provide electronic mail alerts
(monitoring), and search for information within sites and information sources (extracting).
Kuhlthau’s information search process (ISP) model (Kuhlthau, 1991, 1993, 2004) featured
the differences in feelings, thoughts, and actions that people experience during the search process (See Figure 2.5). Ingwersen and Järvelin (2006) interpreted the stages as follows: (1)
initiation: being aware of the information need; (2) selection: the general topic for seeking
information is identified and selected; (3) exploration: seeking and investigating information

13

on the general topic; (4) focus formulation: fixing and structuring the problem to be solved; (5)
collection: gathering pertinent information for the focused topic; and (6) presentation: completing seeking, reporting, and using the result of the task. The ISP model has its advantage in
that it considers the psychological aspect of search in information seeking.

Figure 2.5: Kuhlthau’s information search process (1991).
With the analogy of a person picking berries in a forest, Bates (1989) proposed the “berrypicking” approach to information seeking behavior (See Figure 2.6). The approach envisioned
an information seeker moving through an information space, gathering chunks of information
and seeking cues that help to navigate them through a decision. This model highlighted the
dynamism of needs during the search, not the actual activities.

2.1.4

Information Exploration Model

Waterworth and Chignell (1991) suggested the information exploration model with three dimensions: (1) structural responsibility (navigation vs. mediated search), (2) target orientation
(browsing vs. querying), and (3) interaction methods (descriptive vs. referential), as shown in
Figure 2.7.
Considering the difference between exploratory behavior in terms of querying and browsing, Waterworth and Chignell (1991) came up with a visual description of information exploration behaviors in Figure 2.8.

and Chignell (1991).

2.1.5

Information Foraging Theory (IFT)

Following the berrypicking approach, Pirolli and Card (1997) proposed information foraging
theory (IFT) that adopts an evolutionary ecology approach. It pursued explanations that take
environmental structure and variation as an essential element in the explanation of the observed
behavioral structure and variation. Applying foraging theory (Stephens and Krebs, 1986) and
the algorithm for optimal selection policy, Pirolli and Card (1997, p.33) suggested a person as
an “information predator” whose aim is to select “information prey,” maximizing the rate of
information gain relevant to her task. Optimization of the model predicts that people somehow rank the probabilities of the information prey’s relevance. IFT believes the information
foraging adaptations are exaptions (i.e., an application to one purpose that becomes adapted
to another) of the behavioral plasticity that humans developed for food-foraging. The theory also highlighted that people adapt to the constraints and problems they face in complex,
dynamic, technology-based environments where they conduct tasks that require processing external information-bearing resources. The problems and constraints of such environments can
be seen as forming abstract landscapes of information value and costs, such as the costs of
accessing, rendering, and interpreting information.
The marginal value theorem (Charnov, 1976) was suggested to handle the analysis of the
optimal amount of time spent in a patch. The theorem dealt with situations where foraging

within a patch has decelerating cumulative gain function, as shown in Figure 2.9. The theorem
states that a forager would stay in a patch as long as the marginal rate of gain within the patch is
greater than the overall rate of gain for the environment when averaged across navigation time
and within-patch time. Figure 2.10 represents Charnov’s marginal value theorem capturing the
basic relations for the situation in which there is only one kind of patch-gain function, gi (t).
The prevalence of patches in the environment (assuming random distribution) can be captured
by λ , the average rate of patch encounters while the forager is searching. The average interpatch navigation time will be 1/λ . In Figure 2.10 (a), navigation time between patches is plotted
on the horizontal axis, starting at the origin and moving to the left. To draw a line tangent to
the gain function g1 (t) and passing through 1/λ1 to the left of the origin determines the overall
maximum rate of gain R1 , the slope of the tangent. The point of tangency also provides the
optimal maximum foraging time tˆ1∗ .
Figure 2.10 (a) shows that as inter-patch navigation time decreases, from 1/λ1 to 1/λ2 , the
optimal residence time decreases from t1∗ to t2∗ . Figure 2.10 (2) suggests that as the quality of a
patch increases, from the gain function g2 to g1 , the optimal residence time decreases.

Interaction with Environment: General Behavior

This section generally reviews behavioral models and styles observed in physical & online
spaces and examines previous works that study the factors found to be associated with the
revealed behaviors.

2.2.1

Behavioral Models

People have their own typical behaviors in spatial, social, and temporal contexts and situations.
They live day-to-day and tend to have generalized and habitual behavior patterns regarding
particular routines. For instance, a student who studies at a university has a periodic cycle in a
regular semester, such as class schedule, social events among friends and family, and a series
of assignments, exams, and research projects. Multiple studies have acknowledged the role
of individual personalities, demographic variables, and personal contexts in such behaviors.
However, earlier studies had to focus on traits that can be easily observed - such as gender

18

Figure 2.10: Charnov’s marginal value theorem (from (Pirolli and Card, 1997))

19

and ethnicity - or examined in a short time in a controlled environment such as in a lab experiment. While the behaviors observed in a constrained setting might not accurately represent
the person’s natural and innate actions, data recorded or reported by a participant also has several limitations, including subjectivity in observation, recall/cognitive/socio-cognitive biases,
and limited observation opportunities (Eagle and Pentland, 2006; Giles, 2012; Podsakoff et al.,
2003).
Meanwhile, the emergence of smartphones and passive sensors in various devices has allowed the gathering of rich, personalized data as well as the creation of human behavioral
models in daily life, connecting them to various outcomes. Singh et al. (2013) collect individuals’ social behavior such as face-to-face interactions, phone calls, and SMS. They use logs to
predict spending behaviors that include visiting diverse businesses or overspending. Individuals’ spatio-temporal behavior has been studied regarding their financial outcomes (Singh et al.,
2015). Contextual signals from device sensors have encouraged researchers to build systems
that are able to detect depression (Burns et al., 2011) , emotion and affect (Rachuri et al., 2010;
Yano et al., 2012), student life (Wang et al., 2014), personality traits (de Montjoye et al., 2013),
and social networks (Stopczynski et al., 2014).

2.2.2

Mobility Behavior

Past research investigates individuals’ trajectories with different perspectives: mobile trajectory with temporal spatial regularity (González et al., 2008), mobility patterns and social networks (Wang et al., 2011; Cho et al., 2011), location with context (Eagle and Pentland, 2006),
and spending over various places (Shmueli et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2015). Pappalardo et al.
(2015b) find two distinct types of people based on geographic movement - returners and explorers - through the analysis of large-scale real life mobility datasets; returners limit their
mobility to a few locations, while the mobility of explorers cannot be reduced to few locations. Barbosa et al. (2016) discover similar patterns in human mobility and Web browsing
behaviors based on four years of historical data. Along this line, regarding the similarity of
human navigating behavior over both physical space and digital space, Benn et al. (2015) use
fMRI experiments to find that people use similar brain structures in both environments: limbic
(including the retrosplenial cortex) and parahippocampal regions.

20

2.2.3

Personality Traits

Multiple studies have defined individuals’ personalities into particular traits and one example
of these looks at five aspects of personality - Big Five Traits - such as Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness (John and Srivastava, 1999). While
the detailed factors and measures regarding five facets of personality have been discussed and
developed by scholars, one example description for the five dimensions is presented in Table
2.1.
Tidwell and Sias (2005) investigated information seeking behavior of organizational newcomers, who are proactively seeking new information to reduce uncertainty whilst adapting to
the new working environment. The results indicated that conscientious newcomers were more
likely to overtly seek information, being motivated toward success.
Amichai-Hamburger and Ben-Artzi (2003) discovered that for men the use of Internet services is not related either to the extent of feeling loneliness, neuroticism or extraversion but for
women, loneliness is related both to neuroticism and the use of social services in the Internet.
Heinström (2003) studied the extent to which information behavior can be predicted by
personality. They conducted correlation analysis between personality measured by NEO FiveFactor Inventory (NEO FFI) (Costa and MacCrae, 1992) and information seeking traits such
as critical information judgment, time pressure, etc. The results are presented in Table 2.11.
For instance, neuroticism - the vulnerability to negative emotions - was found to be related to
preference for confirming information, feeling that time pressure was a barrier to information
searching and retrieval. These connections indicate that negative affection may hinder successful information retrieval, supporting the relationship between temporary states of anxiety and
levels of persistence in searching (Ford et al., 2001).

2.2.4

Cognitive Styles

Cognitive style can be defined as “an individual’s preferred and habitual approach to organize
and represent information” (Felder and Spurlin, 2005; Riding and Rayner, 2013) and has been
studied in various domains. For instance, regarding students’ learning patterns and performance
in online instructions, individual’s cognitive style was found to be affecting the ways in which

they view ideas, think, react to and represent situations, make decisions, conduct information
seeking tasks, and retrieve information (Chen and Liu, 2011).
Past studies have examined people’s cognitive styles and defined cognitive style with different terms, as shown in Table 2.2: field-dependent vs. field-independent (Witkin et al., 1975);
divergent vs. convergent (Hudson, 1967); holist vs. serialist (Pask, 1976); verbalizer vs. visualizer (Richardson, 1977); and wholist-analytic/verbal-imagery (Riding and Cheema, 1991).
To investigate and assess individual cognitive styles, several instruments have been developed such as the Revised Approaches to Studying Inventory (Tait et al., 1998), Group Embedded Figures Test (Witkin, 1971), Cognitive Style Index (Allinson and Hayes, 1996), VerbalImagery Code Test (Riding and Calvey, 1981), and Cognitive Styles Analysis Test (Riding,
1991).
Regarding the cognitive styles in information seeking, Ford et al. (2002) tested several

Divergent people see new combinations of
ideas and to examine the possibilities of more
than one way of doing things, leading to several outcomes.
Convergent people are ones who tend to look
for unique methods and unique solutions.
Such thinkers are noted for creativity or lateral thinking.
Holists build up an overview of the learning
situation and later fill in the details of the
learning schema.
Serialists prefer to concentrate on particular
features of the data and build up a conception
of the situation from these details.
Verbalizers prefer verbal information that can
be read or listened to.
Visualizers prefer visual information such as
diagrams, pictures, and graphs.

hypotheses linking global/analytic cognitive styles and perspectives of researchers’ problemsolving and information seeking behavior. Their results showed that field-independent researchers are more analytic and active than field-dependent scholars, and holists are more engaged in exploratory and serendipitous search behavior than serialists.

2.2.5

Hierarchy of Behaviors

One significant claim that Information Foraging Theory (Pirolli and Card, 1997; Pirolli et al.,
2003) employed from Newell (1994) and Anderson (2002) is that the behaviors related to human cognition can be viewed and modeled at many different levels, or time scales. Newell
(1994) and Card et al. (1983) viewed human behavior as a hierarchically organized system in
which the basic time scale of operation of each system level increases by a factor of 10 as one
moves up the hierarchy (see Figure 2.12).

Figure 2.12: Time scales of different bands of behavior. (Adapted from (Newell, 1994))
For instance, behavioral analysis at the biological band level (approximately milliseconds to
tens of milliseconds) is governed by biochemical, biophysical, and especially neural processes.
At the level of cognitive, or psychological band, the typical unit of analysis is a single response
function, which involves a perceptual input stage, a cognitive stage, and a stage of output
action. As the time scale of activity increases, at the rational band, the behavior is analyzed
based on task, which is defined by a goal. It is assumed that a person has preferences for
actions that they perceive to be applicable to their environment and that they know will move
the current situation toward the goal, goals, knowledge, perceptions, actions, and preferences

25

that shape their behavior. On the other hand, the structure, constraints, and resources given in
the environment where the task occurs (task environment) will also shape behavior. Behavioral
analysis at the rational band is dominated by rational principles that are shaped by the structure
and constraints of the task environment.

2.2.6

Domain-General Search Process

An ongoing debate in the cognitive literature concerns the process for search, problem solving, and decision making in a variety of domains. One argument is that the mind incorporates
numerous autonomous and domain-specific neural modules (Barrett and Kurzban, 2006; Cosmides and Tooby, 1994), each of which is designed to manage a specific class of problems.
On the other hand, evidence is accumulating that supports the existence of domain-general
cognitive processes, specifically, the search process as the means for problem solving.
Hills et al. (2008) discovered behavioral tendencies over different search spaces - a spatial
search and a lexical search task - to suggest the priming effect on the domain-general search
process. Participants were first asked to find as many resource tokens as possible, searching in
a virtual world on the PC screen. The resource was distributed in various ways - diffusely or
in clusters - and participants chose to give up on a given area and move on or to stay on local
resource patches. After finishing the spatial search, participants were asked to find a total of
30 words over a series of letter sets, with one letter set at a time. They could move to another
letter set when they felt they had sufficiently exhausted another. Participants who conducted
the spatial search in a clustered space tended to continue searching longer in each letter set,
which indicates they transferred their behavior for one task to a superficially dissimilar task.

2.3.1

Searching Behavior
Animal Foraging

In animal ecological study, searching behavior has been investigated regarding animals’ behavior seeking food, nest, and other resources for their need. Animal foraging literature has shown
that different animals exhibit individualistic patterns of foraging (e.g. Hawkes and O’Connell
(1985)). When presented with a spatial distribution of “patches” with different utility, animals

26

face a trade-off between the conflicting demands of sampling a variable environment and the
exploitation of the most profitable resources (e.g. Clark and Ehlinger (1987)). The response of
different animals to this trade-off varies, and while some animals demonstrate higher degrees
of “exploration” across patches, others tend to show higher degrees of “exploitation” of the
known patches (Smith and Sweatman, 1974a; Sih et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 1994; Groothuis
and Carere, 2005). Further, while certain animals tend to show very similar patterns of behavior
over time even with the changes in the environment, others demonstrate behavioral “plasticity”
and change their behavior promptly (Réale et al., 2000; Dall et al., 2004). A combination of
these behavioral traits - exploration, exploitation, and plasticity - has been demonstrated to
have significant predictive power on an animal’s social stature, survivability, metabolism rates,
reproductive success, well being, and other life outcomes (Smith and Sweatman, 1974b; Sih
et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 1994; Groothuis and Carere, 2005).

Figure 2.13: Proportion of time spent searching for resources compared to time spent handling
(opening, subduing, swallowing) and pursuing (or chasing down) food resources. Copied from
Bell (2012).
More specifically, the behavior can be categorized into three behaviors: (1) searching, (2)
pursuing, and (3) handling. Whereas searching is the process of finding resources, pursuing

27

includes stalking and chasing down prey, and handling means the process of subduing, swallowing, and digestive pauses. Bell (2012) presented the proportion of time allocated to search,
pursuit, and handling for a number of species (see Figure 2.13).

2.3.2

Web Search Behavior

In general (online) search tasks, search interactions consist of search queries and content page
selections from the search engine results page (SERP). The search queries that users pose to
search engines or systems are explicit, usually short presentations of search intent. Users reveal their interests and intentions and include information to retrieve relevant content through
the queries. Thus, query formulation can be a challenging task with mental, cognitive, and
temporal efforts, especially concerning topics for which the searcher may lack domain knowledge (Stanton et al., 2014; Zuccon et al., 2015). Aula (2003) studied the factors that affect
query formulation in web search, and the questionnaire responses suggest that experience in
using computers, web, and web search engines affect the query formulation process; more
specifically, (1) media expertise, (2) domain expertise, and (3) type of search are significant.
Generally, experienced searchers generate longer and more specific queries.
Users click on hyperlinks on the SERP to either navigate to another location or perform
some other actions, for example, following a query suggestion or going through the available
search results. Searchers evaluate the relevance or usefulness of information, examining particular pages. Dwell time, or viewing time, on a retrieved document is a useful signal of document
relevance. In this regard, dwell time is used to identify individual and task differences in implicit feedback performance (Kelly and Belkin, 2004; White and Kelly, 2006).
As in the interactive processes between the user and the search environment, search trails a timely ordered sequence of items visited by searchers (Bilenko and White, 2008) - represent
the dynamics between user and system/environment. However, when behaviors revealed in the
trails are not static, visualization and search trail analysis are not straight forward. In this regard, inspired by the problem behavior graphs (Newell and Simon, 1972), Card et al. (2001)
suggested the web behavior graph (WBG) to analyze people’s activity during information foraging experiments, and White and Drucker (2007) investigated the behaviors from different
classes of searchers.

28

Broder (2002) differentiated and introduced a taxonomy of web searches, categorizing
‘queries’ according to their intent into three classes: (1) navigational, the intent is to reach
a particular site; (2) informational, the intent is to acquire some information presented on one
or more web pages; and (3) transactional, the intent is to perform some web-mediated activities such as purchasing a product on an online shopping site. Based on Broder’s taxonomy,
Kang and Kim (2004) showed that optimizing search engines with regard to different intent of
informational and navigational search improved the performance. There are several studies that
employed eye tracking methods to investigate search behaviors. Several key variables can be
used as significant indicators of ocular behaviors, including fixations, saccades, pupil dilation,
and scan paths (Rayner, 1998). A fixation refers to a spatially stable gaze that lasts for approximately 200 to 300 ms, indicating that the person has a visual attention directed to a specific
area of the visual display, for the most information acquisition and processing. Saccades are
the continuous and rapid eye movements between fixation points, while scanpaths define the
sequences of fixations that represent eye movements and sequential behavior.
Granka et al. (2004) analyzed eye-tracking data to discover that (1) before making an initial
click (not the first ranked link), users fixate on abstracts presented for links ranked first and
second, and (2) users who selected the lower ranked links tend to view more abstracts overall,
indicating that users scan the list and abstracts from top to bottom.
Klöckner et al. (2004) looked into both breadth-first and depth-first sequence patterns revealed by Google usage records. While depth-first searches mean that a user visits the page
described by an abstract on the Google SERP before reading the next abstract, breadth-first
searches refer to reading each abstract in the Google result list before visiting the page(s) of
interest.
Teevan et al. (2004) interviewed fifteen Computer Science graduates twice a day over five
days, grouping them into filers (people who organized information using fixed structures) and
pilers (people who maintained unstructured information organization). They observed that filers and pilers relied on two different search strategies. Filers relied more on keyword searches,
while pilers were more likely to use site search engines (such as eBay site search) rather than
generic search engines.
Aula et al. (2005) defined two kinds of search strategy - “economic” and “exhaustive” -

29

based on whether a user scanned less than or more than half of the visible results before making
a decision to click. Figure 2.14 presents examples of both evaluation styles. The y axis refers to
the vertical position in the search result page and the x axis shows the order in which different
area of interests (AOIs) were visited. The size of each circle presents the time spent on each
AOI, the largest circle meaning approximately 3 seconds.

Figure 2.14: Examples of evaluation styles: exhaustive and economic style. In task A, the
results shown to participants were irrelevant, thus both users reformulated the query. Task B
shows the case in which most of the results were relevant. Copied from Aula et al. (2005).
Lorigo et al. (2006) examined the effect of gender and task on information seeking behavior
on the web, analyzing users’ eye movement sequence patterns in searching with Google. In
addition to developing the definitions for compressed scanpath and minimal scanpath, they
characterized users’ search strategies into three categories: (1) complete scanpath, in which the
path preceding an actual click contains all abstracts of rank n, for all n less than or equal to the
rank of the selected web document; (2) linear when the minimal sequence of the user’s scanpath
is monotonically increasing in increments of 1; and (3) strictly linear when the corresponding
compressed sequence is monotonically increasing in increments of 1.
Figure 2.15 shows an example of scanpath on a Google search results page. When it comes
to the ordered sequence of fixation upon the abstracts, the example indicates a scanpath of
2 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 1 ⇒ 1 ⇒ 1. The compressed scanpath is obtained by aggregating subsequent
fixations that remain on the same abstract into one element; in this example, 2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 2 ⇒ 1.
The minimal scanpath is obtained by removing repeat visits, or regressions, from the compressed sequence. The example here would show the minimal path of 2 ⇒ 3 ⇒ 1, providing
the overall ordering of the abstracts viewed.

30

Figure 2.15: An example of a scanpath on a Google results page. Copied from Lorigo et al.
(2006).
The results showed the different search behavior for different task types (informational vs.
navigational) while there is no significant difference between gender. The conclusion stated
that information tasks need more time for completion than navigational tasks, while the time
spent reading abstract(s) before making the first click tends to be longer in navigational tasks.
White and Drucker (2007) studied the extent of users’ search behavior variability over a five
month period. They concluded that information seekers can be classified into two broad categories: Navigator sand Explorers . Navigators, like filers as presented in Teevan et al. (2004),
employ a search strategy to organize information, with directed searches and topical coherence
in the search trails. Explorers, similar to pilers in Teevan et al. (2004), have information overlap
(re-visits to multiple links) when searching for information.
When it comes to the search behavior on different devices and/or environments, Kim et al.
(2012) investigated search examination strategies on different screen sizes with thirty-two participants using Klöckner et al. (2004)’s taxonomy. They observed that users implemented more
breadth-first and fewer depth-first strategies on a large screen than on a small screen, contrary
to Klöckner et al. (2004)’s findings. These previous works looked at search strategies on desktop and suggested that user factors and individual differences resulted in two distinct search
strategies of interaction with search engines.

31

Li et al. (2009) discussed the concept of good abandonment . It was considered as good
abandonment when a user’s information need was already satisfied by information displayed
on the SERP itself resulting in no result clicks. The good abandonment rate was found to
be significantly higher on mobile than on desktop. In general, the ease of query inputs and
the difficulty in finding relevant information would both encourage additional reformulations
beyond the first queries.

2.3.3

Exploratory Behavior

Exploratory behavior, from a zoological perspective, is defined as “a form of appetitive behavior that may be goal-oriented (e.g. the search for food or nesting material) or concerned with
the examination of areas or articles with which an animal is unfamiliar” (Allaby, 1999). The
behavior also refers to “the movements made by an animal and humans to learn about a new
environment,”1 or “the tendency to explore or investigate a novel environment,”2 which is not
a clearly distinguishable motivation from curiosity.
Regarding animal foraging behavior, previous studies have shown that different animals
exhibit individualistic patterns of foraging (Hawkes and O’Connell, 1985), and that the longterm stable patterns have been demonstrated to have significant associations with an animal’s
social stature, reproductive success, well being, and other life outcomes (Smith and Sweatman,
1974a; Sih et al., 2004; Groothuis and Carere, 2005; Wilson et al., 1994).
Exploration is most often measured as a change in motor activity (distance traveled, line
crosses, rearing, etc.) and sometimes as time spent in, or the frequency of entering, the center
of an open field (Platel and Porsolt, 1982; Thiel et al., 1999).
When it comes to measuring and evaluating animals’ exploratory behavior, Genaro and
Schmidek (1999, 2000) compared the exploratory activity of rats in three different environments: (1) plain open field; (2) open field with a refuge; and (3) complex environment with a
refuge. They observed the rats for 15 minutes, measuring the following variables:
• latency to leave the den
1 http://psychologydictionary.org/exploratory-behavior/
2 http://www.reference.md/files/D005/mD005106.html

32

• time spent in the environment
• distance covered
• number of rearings (i.e. standing on hind legs)
• number of fecal pellets
Expecting to see a difference in rats’ exploratory behavior after chemical treatment, Dubovicky
et al. (1997) measured (1) spontaneous motor activity (number of crossed squares), and (2) vertical exploratory activity (number of rears: both forepaws lifted off the floor). Dubovický et al.
(1999) also measured rats’ behavior in open field tests.
According to the ‘cognitive map’ theory (O’keefe and Nadel, 1978), animals and human
beings, when placed in a novel environment, started to form an internal representation of the
surrounding spatial information.
However, exploratory behavior can hold somewhat different meanings depending on the
situations in which an animal or a person is placed. Welker (1957) compared rats’ explorations
in two circumstances: (1) one in which the animal was forced to occupy an enclosure; and
(2) the other in which it was allowed the freedom to choose entry into the same situation.
The experiment was conducted over 5 minutes for 21 consecutive days. A rat’s activity was
counted every time its head moved from one floor sector (marked as a box on the floor) to
another. The results indicate that greater activity occurs during forced sessions, and suggest
that (a) exploratory behavior may serve to avoid a novel situation as well as to approach one;
and (b) unless the animal is allowed to make this choice, researchers cannot be ascertained
which variety of exploration is being exhibited.

2.3.4

Exploration in Learning

In a learning context, exploratory behavior is defined as an active interaction on the part of the
learner (or trainee) with the learning environment via multiple attempts to solve the problem at
hand (Dormann and Frese, 1994). This has been an important tenet of the constructivist theory
of learning (Bruner, 1961). Bruner (1961) argued that “Practice in discovering for oneself
teaches one to acquire information in a way that makes that information more readily viable in

33

problem solving” (p.26). In a learning process, a person explores to transform rules, principles,
and strategies into knowledge and skill.
Curiosity is defined as a desire to know, to see, or to experience; it motivates individuals’
exploratory behavior aimed at acquiring new information (Berlyne, 1966; Loewenstein, 1994;
Litman, 2005). The exploration begins with a gap between one’s current knowledge and the
information they need to address a problem. In this sense, Hardy et al. (2014) articulated
that learners who explore more will gain a much deeper and complete understanding of the
relative effectiveness of a variety of different approaches in response to dynamic stimuli. Given
that the exploration represents a systematic process in which people identify, discover, and
address knowledge relevant to immediate task performance (Loewenstein, 1994), the effects
of exploratory behavior on learning may vary in different types of tasks, for instance, active
learning training that demands complex and dynamic decision-making vs. simple instructional
repetition.

2.3.5

Exploratory Information Seeking

In the context of information seeking, exploratory behavior can frequently be observed in exploratory search. White and Roth (2009) depicted exploratory search as a type of information
seeking that is associated with other information behavior models/disciplines such as IR, information foraging, information visualization, and sense-making (See Figure 2.16). In this regard,
they defined exploratory search as a sense making activity focused on the gathering and use
of information to foster intellectual development. Users who conduct exploratory searches are
generally unfamiliar with the domain of their goals, and unsure about how to achieve them.
As the factors relating to exploratory search behavior or task, several aspects have been
investigated.
Considering the dynamic and evolving nature of exploratory search, previous studies have
investigated the factors relating to this task, such as uncertainty, creativity, innovation, knowledge discovery, serendipity, convergence of ideas, learning, and investigation. Foster and Ford
(2003) studied the nature of serendipity, which has been considered in the literature to form an
integral part of the creative process in the arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, as ways by which people keep continuing exploring information space, gathering new,

34

Figure 2.16: Exploratory search relative to related research disciplines. Copied from White and
Roth (2009).
novel knowledge.
White and Roth (2009) suggested several features that support exploratory search. First,
search systems can help users explore the Web space by providing efficient ways to locate
and make sense of information that they encounter during searching. One method for locating
relevant information is to support querying and rapid query refinement based on the topics users
are interested in. For the documents retrieved via generated queries, clustering and faceted
categorization are methods that organize search results into meaningful groups, helping make
sense of the results and decide on actions.
While the aforementioned methods are focused on information retrieval mechanism of the
exploratory search systems, another approach is to understand users’ searching behavior and
patterns. Implicit contextual information of users can be extracted from their interaction behavior such as current computing activities (e.g. reading or composing email) (Dumais et al.,
2004), display time (Kelly and Belkin, 2004), query history and click activities (Shen et al.,
2005). Moreover, to better help users learn more about the subject area in which they are
searching, computer-based enhancements can be employed showing historical data of users’
engagement to documents.

35

While previous studies assumed that users have similar behavioral patterns with regards to
information searching, Medlar et al. (2017) attempted to provide an interactive information retrieval system that adapts users’ changing exploration/exploitation behavior during exploratory
search tasks. Implicit feedback data such as clicks and reading time in the system interface and
self-reported knowledge level to the given topic explains users’ preferable exploration ratio, the
higher value of which means the system will provide the more diverse, or exploratory, results
to users.

2.4

Preliminary Work

In our previous study (Choi et al., 2016), we identified multiple geographic exploration features
that have significant associations with an individual’s information exploration behavior, based
on a two-week field study with 35 participants. The workflow of this work is presented in Table

Lab Session

We installed app(s) on their smartphones to collect participants’ mobility data and social
interactions in their everyday lives. Participants’ information behavior was also captured during
an exploratory search task via a logging tool (Coagmento3 ). The tool recorded users’ actions
within the browser, including visited Webpages and timestamped queries run on Web search
engines. Data allowed us to understand and measure users’ search behaviors (Kelly, 2007).

To investigate exploratory search behavior, we focused on two aspects of the search task:
input to search as expressed by queries, and output of search as represented by the nature of the
information (Webpages, in this case) discovered. The former can be measured using inter-query
and within-query diversity and the latter can be measured using novelty of discovery suggested
in Shah and González-Ibáñez (2011). These three measures are explained below in detail.
Inter-Query Diversity (ID): One indicator of exploratory behavior in the searches conducted by a user is the difference in attempted queries. To find the difference between two
queries, we used Generalized Levenshtein (edit) distance, a commonly used distance metric for
measuring the distance between two character sequences (Levenshtein, 1966).
Within-Query Diversity (WD): In information theory, entropy Shannon (2001) refers to
the amount of uncertainty of an unknown or random quantity. In information retrieval literature,
entropy is used to measure the effectiveness of combination of terms, for example, via the
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) (Cooper, 1983). Hence, we gauged the relative unique and
informative value of a specific query with an entropy-based measure. We first calculated the
information entropy as follows:
|unigramsQa |

EntropyQa = −

∑

pu log2 pu

(2.1)

i=1

Where pu is the frequency of counts of each unigram, u appearing in each query string, Qa ,
found in the entire dataset. The within-query diversity for each user can be defined as the mean
of entropy values of each distinct issued query as follows.
NQ

WD =

∑a=1 EntropyQa
|Q|

(2.2)

Higher value of within-query diversity means that the participant has entered diverse keywords in a query during the search task.
Novelty of Discovery (ND): In an exploratory search task where there is plenty of information available for a topic, one does not need to be skilled at exploration to find a large amount
of information. Therefore, what really exhibits one’s exploratory behavior is the ability to find
information that is novel - not found by many. To measure this, we used Likelihood of Discovery (LD), defined by Shah and González-Ibáñez (2011). LD for webpage wpi is defined as

37

follows:

LDwpi =

−1 · n{wpi }
|U|

(2.3)

Here, n{wpi } is the number of users who found wpi and |U| is the total number of users.
Therefore, LD for a page goes from −1/|U| (highest) to −1 (lowest). The Novelty of Discovery
measure for each user can be found as follows:
|Coverage|

LDwpi
∑
ND = i=1
|Coverage|

(2.4)

Where |Coverage| is the set of distinct content pages that a user visited. Thus, ND goes
from −1/|U| (found most novel pages) to −1 (found most common pages). For a large N this
metric ranges between −1 and 0 with a higher value indicating a higher propensity to find novel
information.
In terms of geographic exploration, we measured (1) total number of unique locations visited by an individual during the field session; (2) the extent of how evenly a user moves between
different locations (Location Diversity); and (3) the repetitions in user movements (Location
Loyalty), as explained below.
Unique Locations: This is a measure of location-based activities: the total number of
unique locations visited by a user during the field session.
Location Diversity:

D = − ∑ pi · logb (pi )

(2.5)

i

Where pi = percentage of overall visits that were devoted to location i, and b is the total
number of unique locations visited.
The diversity score measures how evenly a user’s geographic movements are distributed between different locations, using Shannon Entropy Song et al. (2010); Pappalardo et al. (2015a).
A user with low diversity distributes her time unevenly across locations, whereas a user with
high diversity spends time evenly across many locations.
Location Loyalty: Loyalty characterizes the repetitions in user movements. Similar to an
animal going back to the same patch of grass, this characterizes the tendency of a user to go

38

back to his favorite locations.
k

L = ∑ pi

(2.6)

i

Where pi = percentage of overall visits that were devoted to location i, and k is the chosen
threshold on a user’s favorite locations. We considered k to be top-third of a given user’s most
frequent locations. Note that we employed the meaning of loyalty used in Singh et al. (2015)
and adjusted it to our context given the limited number of locations visited by the participants.
A similar top-third threshold has been adopted by multiple studies to demarcate the groups or
the relationships with highest tie strength or social prestige in the past Lippitt and Gold (1959).
In essence, the loyalty feature captures the degree of repetition in a participant’s movement
patterns.
The resulting values are between 0 and 1, with the larger numbers meaning higher spatial
loyalty. For example, a user with very high spatial loyalty will spend almost all of her time (e.g.
80%) in her favorite locations, while a user with low spatial loyalty might spend only 40% of
her time in the top-third of her visited locations.

We first looked at if and how different aspects of geo-exploration relate to aspects of search
behaviors that exhibit exploration. The results are presented in Table 2.4. The results show
that Location Diversity was positively correlated with Within-Query Diversity (WD), while
negatively related to Novelty of Discovery (ND). This indicated that those who visited more
diverse locations were also likely to have more within-query diversity and find less unique content. Though we considered the work to be potentially transformative, it lacks an understanding

39

of participants’ intentions and contexts regarding “exploration,” and requires a bridge that connects information behavior in a lab setting and geographic exploration in a natural environment.
While this preliminary work provided interesting results and possible relationship between
onine and physical exploratory behavior, it lacks (1) the extent to which these behavior are
related to each other, (2) what determines the similarity/dissimilarity between the behavior.
The limitations inspired me to examine physical search behavior in the smaller scale that is
comparable to the PC monitor screen (online space).

Chapter 3
Conceptual Framework

In this section, several theoretical frameworks that guide the dissertation, including the research
questions, are presented. These are: Wilson’s nested information behavior model, everyday life
information seeking (ELIS), information foraging theory (IFT), human information interaction
(HII), hierarchical behavioral model, and general search process model. First, Wilson’s nested
information behavior model outlines how information behavior can be viewed as a particular
perspective of peoples’ general behavior. Everyday life information seeking (ELIS) outlines
how people engage in information interactions in context. While information foraging theory
(IFT) draws an analogy between humans’ foraging for information and animals’ pursuit of
food, human information interaction (HII) investigates the way in which people interact with
their external environments, sometimes even in relation to internal factors. Last, the hierarchical behavioral model and the general search process model in cognitive literature ground my
research problem, comparing search behavior in different information spaces.

3.1

Information Behavior Model

Peoples’ behaviors related to information consist of different constructs regarding context and
levels of focus and understanding. To understand individuals’ exploratory behavior in both
physical and online spaces, it would be useful to investigate the diverse territory and categories
that are associated with information behavior. In this sense, Wilson has developed and proposed several models of information behavior. Wilson (1981) proposed a model representing
the user, the systems employed during the seeking process, and the information resources as a
final goal, as described in Figure (3.1). In the context of a ”universe of knowledge,” the user’s
life world refers to the totality of experiences centered on the person as an information user.
The user interacts with various types of information systems, in which two sub-systems exist:

41

the ”mediator,” which refers to a living system such as a human being; and the ”technology,”
which here represents whatever combination of techniques and tools constitute the information system. Through the information system, the user can reach various ”embodiments of
knowledge” that indicate final goals, such as locating documents or finding people who own
the knowledge.

Figure 3.1: The information user and the universe of knowledge. Copied from Wilson (1981).
Wilson (1997) suggested a revised version of his information behavior model to incorporate
theories from a variety of disciplines such as decision-making, psychology, innovation, health
communication, and consumer research. This model attempts to include several factors - or
mechanisms - that explain whether a particular need invokes information seeking behavior,
as well as why an individual prefers specific information sources and intervening variables.
Showing the relationships between information behavior models, Wilson (1999) proposed to
integrate said models into a more general framework, or nested model (see Figure 2.3).
Significant attributes of Wilson’s models included the idea that an information seeker, or
user, is operating in their own “universe of knowledge,” while (general) information behavior has several sub-categories (information-seeking behavior, and information search behavior)
that can apply to broader general behavior. This demands thorough understanding across various disciplines regarding behavior and decision-making.

42

3.2

Information Seeking in Everyday Life

Regarding both the general and specific behaviors people have in their daily lives, everyday life
information seeking (ELIS) is a holistic framework for understanding how people seek and utilize information within their typical routines. Savolainen (1995) provided the concept of human
information seeking behavior and describes the way in which people get a sense of information
around them. Two substantial elements in the model are the ”way of life” and the ”mastery
of life,” which are inspired by the concept of habitus (Bourdieu, 1984). Way of life refers to
the internalized ”order of things,” and mastery of life describes actions taken to maintain order
during tumultuous times in which people have to (re)form their short-term or long-term information behaviors. The study of ELIS pointed out that everyday life and work/job related tasks
are inseparably tied. People may seek information to solve their personal problems as well
as look for relevant information for their professional and/or academic tasks. An important
implication from ELIS to this dissertation is that the importance of specific problem-solving
contexts can be applied to geographical exploration in everyday life. For instance, sometimes
a person may need to explore, or visit, several places in a day due to their job, regardless of
personal preference.

3.3

Information Foraging

To investigate the relationship between an individual’s geographical movement and their information exploration behavior, the current proposal employs Information Foraging Theory (IFT).
The theory (Pirolli, 2007; Pirolli and Card, 1997) attempts to explain information seeking behavior in humans. The food foraging mechanisms in living organisms, such as animals, inspires
the idea to compare humans’ information foraging to animals’ food foraging. Researchers
propose that optimal foraging theory (Stephens and Krebs, 1986) can help them understand
foraging behavior in human actors who consume information for their needs.
In Information Foraging Theory, people face the recurrent problem of finding task-relevant
information. Information flows into the environment to be represented in different types of
external media - such as books, manuscripts, and online documents - that each have different
costs of interpretation and access. Faced with recurrent tasks, a human ”informavore” chooses

43

information types, repositories, and interfaces that optimize benefits over associated costs and
values (Pirolli and Card, 1997).
Athukorala et al. (2014) utilized the framework to examine exploration and exploitation
analysis, and Ruotsalo et al. (2013) employed the foraging model to support exploratory search
tasks considering interactive user modeling.

3.4

Human-Information Interaction in Seeking Information

In fact, we can say that we are surrounded by all types of information in daily life. What
we see, what we hear, and what we feel by sensors in our bodies can be inputted into our
cognitive systems for information processing. In this regard, in addition to human-computer
interaction (HCI), which is a discipline that studies how humans and computers interact and
how technologies can help that interaction, human-information interaction considers a much
broader range of interactions between humans and their environments. This proposed work
also considers the environment, specifically in regard to physical spaces that people visit in
their daily lives to accomplish their given personal and professional tasks.
Fidel (2012) explained two primary, established research areas in human information interaction that relate to information seeking behavior (ISB) and information retrieval (IR): “acquiring information” and “evaluating information.” Saying that ISB “represents only one form of
acquiring information” (p. 21), Fidel is expanding the concept of seeking information, which
is typically perceived as looking for information, or in a broader sense getting information. In
this regard, acquiring information can include three types of behavior: (1) seeking information,
in which people purposely look for information to support actual decision-making or to resolve
an information problem; (2) surfing, which means that people browse through an information
source without a specific goal just to see what it contains; and (3) encountering, in which people
find information they were not intentionally seeking. When it comes to the IR side, evaluating
information is most important to judge whether or not something is relevant to the searcher’s
current problem (Fidel, 2012).
Regarding these two activities - “acquiring information” and “evaluating information” as well as geographical exploration, this proposal suggests a research framework: visit and

44

see. Visit in this sense refers to visiting a place (e.g., a particular office or Website), with the
presumption that the place will hold relevant information or benefits. See describes an action
that evaluates whether the expected benefit occurred after consuming the information.

3.5

Hierarchy of Behaviors

While Wilson’s nested model considers the hierarchical framework in which different layers
of information behavior manifest (Wilson, 1999), scholars in Cognitive Psychology have suggested a similar hierarchy of human behavior in general. Newell (1994) and Card et al. (1983)
viewed human behavior as a hierarchically organized system in which different types of behavior operate based on different time scales (see Figure 3.2).

Figure 3.2: Time scales of different bands of behavior. (Adapted from (Newell, 1994))
For instance, behavioral analysis at the biological band level (approximately milliseconds to
tens of milliseconds) is governed by biochemical, biophysical, and especially neural processes.
At the level of cognitive, or psychological band, the typical unit of analysis is a single response
function, which involves a perceptual input stage, a cognitive stage, and a stage of output
action. As the time scale of activity increases, at the rational band, the behavior is analyzed
based on task, which is defined by a goal. It is assumed that a person has preferences for
actions that they perceive to be applicable to their environment and that they know will move
the current situation toward the goal, goals, knowledge, perceptions, actions, and preferences
that shape their behavior. On the other hand, the structure, constraints, and resources given in

45

the environment where the task occurs (task environment) will also shape behavior. Behavioral
analysis at the rational band is dominated by rational principles that are shaped by the structure
and constraints of the task environment.

3.6

General Search Process in Different Domains

Previous studies in cognitive literature have supported the existence of the general executive
control over different domains in our cognitive system. When it comes to search process,
which is of interest in this dissertation, Hills et al. (2008) discovered behavioral tendencies
over different search spaces - a spatial search and a lexical search task - to suggest the priming
effect on the domain-general search process. Through the comparable experiments of spatial
search, which was simulated on PC screen, and lexical search with letter sets, they found that
those who conducted the spatial search in a clustered space tended to continue searching longer
in each letter set, which indicates they transferred their behavior for one task to a superficially
dissimilar task.

3.7

Summary of Theoretical Frameworks

The dissertation aims to gain a better understanding of an information user’s searching behavior
in physical and online spaces, seeing if they present similar or dissimilar behavioral patterns
in different information environments. To examine information behavior that is expressed in
different contexts, this study views users’ behavior regarding the theoretical framework presented in Figure 3.3, which consists of (1) information behavior perspective and (2) cognitive
psychology perspective.
The left part of the figure represents theories related to information behavior. People can
acquire information through various means, which includes three ways of human information
interaction suggested in Fidel (2012): seeking information, surfing, and encountering. While
Wilson (1997) provides a hierarchical information behavioral model that expands research analysis into a user’s more general behavior, the social interactions and other personal contexts and
constraints in our everyday life also need to be considered (Savolainen, 1995). Presuming individuals’ rational decision making with regard to maximizing information gain, information

46

Figure 3.3: The relationship of theoretical frameworks in the dissertation
foraging theory guides how people explore in information space (Pirolli and Card, 1995, 1997).
The part of the figure to the right depicts the central executive for search in the behavioral
model, which dominates operating related to the search tasks - searching in physical space as
well as in online Web space. In the time-scale based hierarchical behavioral model, suggested in
Newell (1994); Card et al. (1983), this dissertation assumes the existence of the generic, central
executive that is significantly involved with search tasks. While central executive for search
does not explain the whole process, the framework in the figure supposes common behavioral
traits between physical search and online search.
To understand individuals’ information search behavior, more specifically visiting and seeing behavior (two arrows in Figure 3.3) in each space, several experiments were designed and
behaviors of interest were defined. The detailed methodology will be presented in the following
chapter.

47

Chapter 4
Methodology

This chapter describes the methodology I used in the study of information seeking behavior
regarding exploration in physical and online spaces.

4.1

Research Questions

The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate peoples’ searching and exploratory behavior
in online and physical spaces utilizing the behavioral models that demonstrate commonalities between both spaces. In their daily lives, people seek information either to solve specific
problems or to make sense of various topics they face, interacting with various contexts of information needs, task environments and information spaces. To examine this, the following
research questions are proposed:
• RQ1: To what extent, if any, does an individual’s information seeking behavior online
relate to his/her behavior in physical space?
• RQ1a: To what extent, if any, does an individual’s patterns of visiting and seeing physical
spaces relate to his/her visiting and seeing in online spaces?
• RQ2: What aspects, if any, and how much, of an individual’s physical exploration is
related to his/her online information seeking behavior?

4.2

Research Design

Addressing the research questions requires defining and classification of information seeking
contexts in physical space and online space. First, physical search and online search are defined
corresponding to the environment in which the search activities occur. For instance, physical

48

search takes place when looking for information presented in the physical space in our ordinary
lives, such as in documents, books, posters, etc., in various scales of geographical areas, from
a single room to a building to a society and a country. On the other hand, online search refers
to searching for information online, such as in Web documents and social media that we can
access through a variety of information devices (e.g., PCs, smartphones, tablets).
One of the important aspects of information exploration relevant to this study is target orientation (browsing vs. querying) (Waterworth and Chignell, 1991). Browsing is distinguished
from querying in that browsing does not have a specific target in the mind of the person. Also
from a behavioral perspective, while querying starts with target identification, browsing begins
with a starting context which is relatively less specific, such as the table of contents of a book
or a portal site that the user usually opens with a Web browser.
In this regard, situations of information seeking in physical space and online space can be
represented visually, as in Figure 4.1. The dimension of target orientation is referred as everyday life vs. goal-driven, the vertical axis. Everyday life context, more specifically, is usually
depicted with behaviors that include home, to which people regularly return, and habitual, longterm activities. On the other hand, goal-driven behavior is described with specific target(s) in a
short-term period without home places.

Figure 4.1: Experimental design

49

The left-upper box (physical & everyday life) represents the exploratory behavior of people
in their daily life, while the left-bottom box (physical & goal-driven) means the information
seeking in physical space to solve given problems. In online space, the right-upper box (online
& everyday life) is associated with our search logs and the right-bottom box (online & goaldriven) indicates Web search tasks with specific goals.
Our previous study (Choi et al., 2016) examined geographical exploration and online exploration to find the interconnection between them (see (1) in Figure 4.1), but the different task
environments (everyday life vs. goal-driven task) that might have affected peoples’ behavior in
different ways were not considered in that study.
This limitation inspired me to design middle-ground sessions between the field session
(physical & everyday life case) and lab session (online & goal-drive case): escape room and
treasure hunt game, which refer to the activities involved in finding clues and information
placed in a certain location - a room or a building.

Figure 4.2: Study design
The dissertation study consists of three experimental sessions: escape room (ER), treasure
hunt (TH), and Web search (WS). These sessions are designed to investigate individuals’ information searching behavior in different contexts (Figure 4.2). This study design attempts to
connect behavioral patterns in information searching in physical and online space to address

50

research questions. While Web search supposes information is located in online space, physical search in escape room and treasure hunt expects people to look for information from books,
posters, bulletin board, etc. in a room or a building, visiting by hands and feet.

Target Population and Sample

Thirty-one undergraduates from Rutgers University participated in the experiment phase of the
research. The participants were recruited via various email-lists, social network sites (e.g.,
Facebook and Twitter), and flyers. Since the participants will conduct several tasks (Escape
Room, Treasure Hunt and Web Search), they are required to be fluent in English, have normal
or corrected-to-normal vision and hearing, as well as normal motor control.
Each participant was compensated $100 in cash upon completion of the study.

51

4.5

Data Collection

The study utilized several ways of collecting participants’ behaviors in different contexts. To
observe their visiting and seeing behaviors, this study used wearable video recorders, a browser
plugin, and an eye-tracker.

4.5.1

Wearable Video Recorder

During escape room and treasure hunt sessions, each participant was given a wearable video
recorder (See Figure 4.3). The device recorded participants’ behavior, visiting, and seeing
information provided in the game environments.

Figure 4.3: Example of Wearable Video Recorder

4.5.2

Browser Plugin

To collect data related to their search histories, I installed the Coagmento1 browser plugin on
the PC on which the search task was conducted. The plugin collected data about searching
activities as follows:
• userID
1 http://coagmento.org/index.php

52

• timestamp
• questionID
• query
• visited URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
• title of Web page
• host of Web page
• date and time
An example of recorded search logs is presented in Figure 4.4.

Escape Room Game
Purpose and Data

The purpose of escape room game is to capture exploration in physical space in a smaller territory than the subsequent treasure hunt session. While the focus of the treasure hunt session

53

is on the geographical exploration, escape room is focused on observing the participants’ cognitive behavior represented by viewpoint and eye gaze. Even though the video recording on
glasses does not capture the eye gaze as accurately as a mobile eye-tracker does, with the timestamped data, it is able to simulate where a participant was looking for a certain period of time
for reading and reasoning. In reality, the escape room game is usually played as a team, at
least of two people, but since the unit of analysis of the dissertation is individual, the game was
played individually.

4.6.2

Task

In the game room, a participant needs to explore and search first to locate possible clues that
provide following clues toward finding the key to escape that room. Given that there are several
different things that can be suspected to contain a clue, a person needs to judge the relevance of
each thing as to whether to invest his/ her time and effort. All his/her activities were recorded
by the wearable video recorder.
Figure 4.5 shows the escape room set up in a classroom.

Figure 4.5: Escape Room Game. Participants are supposed to search books (left bottom),
posters (left top), and movie posters (right bottom) to unlock boxes presented in the room
(right top).

54

The introduction to the game and tasks used in the preliminary study are as follows.

The Escape Room Story:
A Professor named Tim Murphy is missing. You have entered his office to track possible
clues he left, but you are also locked in his room. You need to keep accomplishing tasks until
you get the final key.
• Task 1: “Multimedia search” is a sub-topic in information retrieval. Find the page of the
chapter of “multimedia search” in a book. Use this page number to open the 3-digit lock.
There are four books related to information search and retrieval in the room. The participant
is expected to pick some books and look at the table of contents of each book to get the page
number, which is 207. Participant will unlock the 3-digit lock with this number and see the
next task.
• Task 2: Find the poster of a movie that was presented by Paramount Pictures and Warner
Bros. What is the first name of the hero of that movie? Then, find a research poster in
which the first author’s name is the same as the actor’s first name. (1) Find out the last
name of the first author. (2) Find how many undergraduate students participated in the
experiment outlined in that research poster.

The first two letters in the answer are the initials of the author’s first and last name.
Next, three digits are the square of the number of undergraduate participants. Use the
answer to unlock the 5-letter lock (

). For instance, if the author is Tim Murphy

and 20 undergraduates were involved in the experiment, the answer is TM400.
Among the movie posters there is one of Interstella, one of whose stars was Matthew McConaughey. And among the research posters, there is one poster written by a researcher named
Matthew Mitsui. 20 undergraduates participated in the study presented in his poster, so the
answer for 5-letter lock is MM400. The participant will open the lock to access the next task.
• Task 3: Hint - Computer [****]s, Olympic [****]s. Look the word in the bracket up in
the dictionary. You should see a word that allows you to open the 4-letter lock.

55

The word in the bracket is game. The participant is expected to open the dictionary to look
up the word to see a highlighted word, play, in the explanation of game. The participant will
open the 4-letter lock to get the next question.
• Task 4: Five Effects of Prediction are: (1) the prediction effect, (2) the data effect, (3)
the induction effect, (4) the ensemble effect, and (5) the ( ) effect (hint: see p. 221 of a
book). Use this word to unlock the tablet PC.
There is a book about prediction analytics, in which one chapter talks about the five effects
of prediction. When opening the book, the participant will figure out that the fifth effect of
prediction is persuasion. This word is the passcode for a table PC in the room. The next task
comes up on the screen when opening the tablet.
• Task 5: [Picture of silver medal] This is a ( ) medal. Find the publication year of a book
that ( ) wrote. Use this publication year to open the 4-digit lock.
The word in the bracket is silver and there is a book written by Nate Silver, in 2012, which
is the 4-digit for the participant to get the key - The end!

4.7.1

Treasure Hunt Game
Purpose and Data

The purpose of the treasure hunt is to observe participants’ geographical exploration as well as
physical searching captured by video recording through a wearable video recorder. Recorded
video with timestamp was used to examine where the participant visits and what she sees during
the game.

4.7.2

Task

Instructions regarding the game was provided:
1. Solve the given questions in the order.

56

2. All information needed is only in the hallways including doors, posters, papers, flyers,
and bulletin boards. So you are not supposed to open any doors or get inside of offices
and classrooms.
3. Set the timer to 20 minutes and come back to this room when time is up, even though
you did not complete all tasks.
The tasks and clues given to participants are as follows.
• Task 1: Find a flyer about an event that will be held at State Theatre, New Jersey on
October 21, 2016.
I put a flyer with the information about a singer’s (Brian McKnight) concert on a bulletin
board at a corner on the third floor. The participant is expected to find the flyer by walking
around the hallways in the building, starting from a room on the second floor.
• Task 2: There is a professor whose first name is the same as one in the flyer. Find this
professor’s office. What is the office number? Keep this number as A.
There is a professor named Brian Householder, whose office is on the second floor. Participant is expected to find his room and keep the room number (215) for later.
• Task 3: Can you find an office that has a picture of Beyoncè nearby. What is the office
number? Keep this as B.
There was a picture of Beyoncè next to the door of office (room 112) on the first floor. The
participant is expected to wander through the halls to look at the doors to locate the picture.
• Task 4: A - B = ? (What is the difference between A and B?) Then, go to the room with
this number in reverse (For example, if A-B=407, then go to the room 704.)
The difference between A and B is 103 and the reverse number is 301. So participant is
expected to go to room 301.
• Task 5: On this floor, can you find information about a Rutgers event that President
Obama attended, and get how many students attended it?

57

I put a magazine on a filing cabinet, which has a picture of President Obama in a graduation
gown when attending the commencement of Rutgers University. The participant is expected to
find the magazine and read an article in it to get the number of students who attended the event.

Web Search
Purpose and Data

The main focus of the Web Search session was to observe participants’ information seeking
behavior during the online search: what they see on the screen and where (what pages) they
visit on Web. To observe the behavior, the logging software installed on the lab PC recorded
participants’ search histories with timestamp, and the eye-tracker recorded their eye movement
during the session.

Problem-solving task

The problem-solving task here refers to a task in which a person searches to find the exact
answer to the given question/problem. For problem-solving type questions, the participants
were presented with A-Google-A-Day (http://agoogleaday.com) questions. I provided them
with 10 questions and asked them to solve as many as they could in 20 minutes. The questions
are as follows:
• Question 1: Who choreographed the musical based on the first novel by the 2003 winner
of the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters?
• Question 2: In the poem that concludes the second section with “Not that final meeting
In the twilight kingdom,” to what historical figure does the second epigraph allude?
• Question 3: Steven Spielberg gained notoriety for a series released in 1957. Who was
the star of this series?
• Question 4: Who, along with his wife, gave Harper Lee the gift of a year’s wages so that
she could quit her job “to write whatever you please”?
• Question 5: This planet’s slow retrograde rotation results in the solar system’s longest
day. How many Earth days equal one day here?
• Question 6: In the century following Columbus’s trip to the New World, people began
playing an organized sport on a frozen surface. Where did that sport begin?
• Question 7: I am Hawaiian and have a conservation status of CR. My cousin, also a CR,
is Mediterranean. Our crab-eating cousin, however, has an LC status. Where does he
live?
• Question 8: It takes approximately 50,000 - 70,000 flowers to make one dry pound of
the world’s most expensive spice by weight. What part of this particular flower is used
to make the spice?
• Question 9: After coining the term radioactive, a scientist discovered two radioactive
elements, one of which is easily found in cigarette smoke. What is the element?

59

• Question 10: I am the 19th-century founder of the country that now has the world’s
largest Ferris wheel. In what year was I born?

4.8.3

Exploratory search task

Following the problem-solving task, I asked participants to conduct an exploratory search task
for twenty minutes. The topic of the search is as follows:
One of your close friends talks to you about his current health and wellness issues, and
since he is not tech-savvy you are trying to assist him in finding useful information so that he
can read the report you write within this task to get more information about his health and
wellness requirements.
He is a 30-year-old male with type 2 diabetes who wants to lose weight. He has internet
access and an iPhone but is not tech-savvy. However, he is usually very busy with work and
family and can only spare three hours each week to exercise. He has asked for your help.
Assemble a diet and exercise program for him, including its benefits and risks. This report
should also cover aspects of possible applications he could easily use to monitor and control
his wellness.
When conducting this task, you should collect as much information as you can by searching
online. Nevertheless, the article should be written with proper context to cater to your friend’s
needs and should elaborate on the various options he has to be healthy. Your article should be
around 700-800 words.

Chapter 5
Analysis

This chapter reviews important concepts and the ways of data analysis used in this dissertation.

5.1

Important Concepts

5.1.1

Information Patch

When Bates (1989) depicts an information seeker moving through an information space in general, Bates assumes information chunks, between which the seeker wanders and moves looking
for information. Information foraging theory (Pirolli and Card, 1995; Pirolli, 2007) uses the
term “information patch” to depict the documents, or Web pages, that the user visits to consume the information from that patch. More specifically, the task environment of an information
forager has a patchy structure (Card et al., 2001): information that a person looks for to meet
her needs may reside in piles of paper documents, file cabinets, bookshelves, libraries, or in
various online documents.
In this study’s Web searching task, the information patch refers to (1) search engine results
page (SERP) and (2) each Web page that the user visits. In the escape room and treasure hunt
session, an information patch can be a book, a poster, a flyer, or a door that has name tags,
stickers, or papers on and near it. Definition of information patches are presented in Table 5.1.

Web Search
Information patch in Web search refers to (1) search engine results page (SERP) and (2) each
Web page that the user visits, either chosen from the SERP or the pages through user’s directly
typing it in.

Treasure Hunt
To identify and annotate corresponding behavior regarding information patches in the treasure
hunt session, I first listed and described all the doors, bulletin boards, directories, posters, flyers,
and signs as shown in Table 5.2.
Table 5.2: Types of information patch in the building where treasure hunt played

patches so the person should move to see the other one.

Directory

Directory information of the building

Poster/flyer

posters and flyers on walls in the hallways, far enough from
the doors, bulletin boards, etc.

Sign

Signs with recognizable size, such as fire extinguisher, advertisements, logos, etc.

I clustered the defined information patches in the previous procedure into one patch when
(1) they are closer than 5 inches and (2) people can see them together without serious problem
from 3-feet distance. Figure 5.1 shows the information patches in the building.

Escape Room
Information patch in Escape Room refers to books, movie posters, and research posters, which
were presented to participants.

5.2

Video Data Coding

Searching patterns were identified by analysis of video data that were recorded during all the
tasks. This section reviews how the behavioral data was annotated.

62

Figure 5.1: Information patches in treasure hunt: Information patches on the first, second and
third floor. Blue rectangles refer to the defined information patches, while circles are location
marks for coding their trajectories.

63

5.2.1

Web Search

To understand and identify participants’ Web searching behavior, the web search log and
recorded screen video during the search tasks were transcribed and coded. Web search logs
were captured through the browser plug-in. Video data includes normal screen capture as well
as eye gaze data. While normal screen capture represents users’ interaction such as mouse cursor movement and keystrokes on the web browser and other computer systems, the eye gaze
data is annotated with circles, increasing along with dwell time for a particular area of interest,
and timestamps. The application for the eye tracker provides a video file that combines both of
screen capture and eye gaze data per one user’s session (see Figure 5.2), and the capture Web
searching behavior were played and replayed several times to examine their behavioral pattern
regarding the online exploration.

Figure 5.2: Video captured during Web search tasks. Green circles represent the user’s area of
interest, or eye gaze, along with timestamps and the order.
I examined participants’ Web searching behavior based on three key aspects:
• Exhaustive vs. economic examination: based on how they scan the Web pages, both of
results pages and content pages.

64

• Web navigation styles: based on how users navigate during Web searching;
• Information processing approaches: based on how they view and process search results
or retrieved result pages;

Exhaustive vs. Economic Examination
Aula et al. (2005) defined two kinds of search strategy - “economic” and “exhaustive” - based
on whether a user scanned less than or more than half of the visible results before making a
decision to click.
Inspired by this measure, I categorized the participants’ behavior into exhaustive examination and economic examination. Economic examination refers to the case in which only the top
one or two results were inspected before the first click. Otherwise, I defined it as an exhaustive
examination.

Web Navigation Styles
Kinley et al. (2014) defined Web navigation styles as two main approaches to locating information on the Web. While navigation refers to a browsing behavior in which the user assesses the
online information and content by following a series of links or pages, I coded the video data
qualitatively considering issued queries, mouse click, scrolling, etc.
Inspired by their approach, participants’ web navigational styles were defined into unstructured and structured. Unstructured users show the navigating behavior in which she performed
an unstructured navigation during Web searching. Participants, who have unstructured navigation, tend to formulate their query, scan the first few search result snippets, click the “next”
button of the search engine, then navigate back and reformulate their query.
Alternatively, Structured users represent behaviors where systematic processes were taking
place during the Web searching tasks. They tend to formulate their query carefully, open fewer
pages, and read the pages in detail. They may open another search result page to formulate a
new query, keeping the previous results.

65

Information Processing Approaches
Kinley et al. (2014) referred to information processing approaches as strategies chosen by
users to read, select, and process information during Web searching. I adopted their three
categorizations of scanning, reading, and mixed.
Scanning refers to browsing behavior in which the user scans a result page or a content for
general information quickly, and makes quick switches between topics and tabs. This type of
person is likely to open relatively more result pages because she is not sure if the confronted
information is relevant and/or appropriate.
In the opposite way, reading refers to the behavior of comprehensively searching, reading
a page in detail, spending more time on relatively smaller number of pages. Mixed approach
adopts both scanning and reading during the Web searching tasks.

Tasks for Coding
From the task 1 (problem-solving task), I examined participants’ data up to the third question
since most participants solved up to the that question. Regarding the exploratory search task,
since there is no success and failure in this task, I observed their behavior on the whole task
and defined their behavioral patterns.

5.2.2

Treasure Hunt

Kotseruba et al. (2016) shows an example of behavioral data coding: observing pedestrians
crossing a road, the authors defined behaviors such as (1) state events: crossing, stopping,
moving fast, moving slow, speeding up, slowing down, clearing a path, and looking; and (2)
point events: look, signal, and handwave. While state event may have an arbitrary duration,
point events last a short fixed amount of time (0.1 sec) and signify a quick glance or gestures
made by pedestrians.
I came up with video data coding scheme for the following purposes: (1) to define information patches in particular information exploration environments; (2) to come up with code that
annotates behavior - (a) moving (b) stopping at information patch, and (c) task performance;
and (3) to simulate a person’s exploratory trajectory in the corresponding information space.

66

Table 5.3: Definition of entering and leaving information patches
Code

Description

Entering

A participant enters into an information patch when starting to engage that patch. It includes (1) stop walking to approach, (2) looking at the same spot while walking slowly,
(3) looking back after passing by the patch, (4) getting the
answer from the information patch (e.g., writing down the
room number), and (5) standing at least 3 feet from the information patch.

Leaving

When a participant leaves the information patch that she
has been looking at.

Visiting patch is an event that has a starting and an ending moment. I annotated entering an
information patch and leaving as defined in Table 5.3 and a ’visiting patch’ is valid only when
the person stays in the patch more than two seconds.
Regarding task completion, I annotated five task completions as defined in Table 5.4. I
observed participants’ behavior for the whole session.
Table 5.4: Definition of task completions
Code

Description

Participant answers the first question, or task, and is ready
for the next task. (locating the flyer with the first answer:
the musician of the concert is Brian McKnight.)

ready for the next task. (locating the faculty’s room number, whose first name is also Brian - 215)

T3 done

for the next task. (locating the room number with a zebra
picture next to it - 112)

T4 done

Participant answers the fourth question, or task, and is

clue)

T5 done

Participant answers the fifth question, or task, and is ready
for the next task. (TH: locating the magazine that covers
Obama’s Rutgers visit and getting the number of attendees)

I used software named Boris (Friard and Gamba, 2016) to annotate behavioral video data.
Figure 5.3 presents the interface of the program with the data from user2. Two trained coders
examined and annotated participants’ visits to particular information patches to get time of

67

visits and the dwell time, or duration. First, a research assistant and I documented a participant’s
behavioral data individually and met to discuss to make the coding scheme coherent.

Figure 5.3: Screenshot of Boris with video data from user 2. Ignore the timestamp in the video
screen since the time was not properly set in the recorder.
After three rounds of data coding and discussion for three participants, the intercoder reliability of coding was evaluated by Generalized Sequential Querier (GSEQ)(Bakeman and
Quera, 2008).
The event-based kappa for the agreement of ‘visit’ information patches was K =.64 (78%
agreement) and time-unit kappa was K =.87-.87 (94%-94% agreement), showing both kappa
values were in either good (0.60–0.75) or excellent (over 0.75) spectrums according to the
benchmarks suggested in Bakeman (2000).
After coding for the first three participants, the two coders continued with the rest of the
data, each analyzing half of the participants and aggregating the behavioral data.

Visiting Behavior
Through annotating information patches in the treasure hunt and the corresponding activities
of participants, I categorized the types of visiting behavior on floors in the building where the
user study was conducted. The concept of exploitation and exploration to explain their visiting
behavior on the floors was adopted from Hills et al. (2015). As shown in Figure 5.4, spatial

68

foraging can be categorized into (1) exploration (exploring more places to find resources) or
(2) exploitation (exploiting fewer places sufficiently to harvest resources). In this regard, I
identified the visiting behavior into two categories. Exploitation refers to visiting more than
two information patches1 on a floor, while Exploration means visiting zero or one patch.

Figure 5.4: Examples of cognitive approaches to the exploration-exploitation trade off. Copied
from Hills et al. (2015).

1 the

criteria of two is derived from the data analysis of all participants whose behavior was appropriately
recorded by the camera.

69

Seeing Behavior
In addition to the visiting behavior, exploration and exploitation, I examined the time the participants spent on information patches to view and assess, as an aspect of seeing behavior. Based
on the staying time, their seeing behavior was categorized into three types: long stay, medium
stay, and short stay. In order to differentiate their staying pattern, I referred several information
patches that most participants visited and viewed, such as I262 on the second floor or I363
on the third floor. Figure 5.5 shows the distribution of staying time on I262 and I363. First,
I measured staying time of each information patch visiting of participants to categorize them
into long stay, medium stay, and short stay, according to the distribution. Then, I combined
a participants’ all staying time labels into one label of long stay, medium stay, or short stay.
Note that not all participants visited the same patches and even for a same patch, a participant’s
staying time varied over time, which required the coder’s interpretation.

Figure 5.5: Distribution of staying time on (A) I262 and (B) I363.

5.2.3

Escape Room

The participants’ searching activities via their sight movements were captured by a video
recorder within provided glasses. Two trained coders created code schemes derived from significant behaviors observed during this session (see Table 5.5). Based on these code schemes
the coders manually recorded participants’ time-stamped behavioral events by using the information patch map (see Figure 5.6) and Boris video coding software (Friard and Gamba, 2016).
Each information patch was arranged with an unique identifier: books (B01 to B20), movie

70

posters (M01 to M08), research posters (R01 to R05), and boxes (L01 to L05). In the code
scheme, type means the attribute of time for the code: state indicates existing time duration and
point means the moment of action.

Book Task
The first task in Escape Room is to find out the chapter page about a particular topic. In order
to locate the answer, participants would pick one or more books to see if there is relevant
information. Twenty books were left on the tables in a row. If the participant goes along
all books first before beginning to read a book, then this person is perceived as exhaustive
evaluator.

71

Figure 5.6: Escape room map with information patches: Rectangles indicate the defined information patches, while circles are the question boxes.
Movie Task
The second task is to locate a movie poster about a film produced by particular film production
companies. In this case, the letters on the posters are small and blurred, so it is usually difficult
to read them from distance. The usual response of participants to begin this task was to take a
step to the wall, visit one information patch (movie poster), and start reading the words on it economic evaluation. However, the video data indicated that some participants, even for a very
short time, did scanning movie posters before they actually started to reading a poster. Through
the scanning behavior, their pattern was annotated as exhaustive evaluation.

Results

This chapter overviews findings that address the following research questions:
• RQ1: To what extent, if any, does an individual’s information seeking behavior online
relate to his/her behavior in physical space?
• RQ1a: To what extent, if any, does an individual’s patterns of visiting and seeing physical
spaces relate to his/her visiting and seeing in online spaces?
• RQ2: What aspects, if any, and how much of an individual’s physical exploration is
related to his/her online information seeking behavior?

Participant Demographics

Participants were recruited via targeted email and social network channels such as the Facebook
group for Rutgers University members. Thirty one (15 male and 16 female) undergraduate
students participated in the study. Participants’ majors vary such as Information Technology,
Business, Computer Science, Psychology, etc. The participants were invited the lab to conduct
Escape Room, Treasure Hunt and Web Search session on a weekend day during November and
December of 2016. After completing the whole study sessions, each of them received $100 in
cash.

Descriptive Analysis

This section presents descriptive analysis results regarding participants’ characteristics and performance during the experimental sessions.

74

6.2.1

Escape Room

Out of thirty one participants’ experimental data, twenty nine students’ recorded video was
valid for the analysis. While there are five tasks that the players need to accomplish in the game,
Table 6.1 shows the number of tasks they were able to finish within twenty minutes. Less than
half (42%) of the participants (thirteen) completed the total five tasks, and four participants
could finish only the first task.

Spatial Capability and Treasure Hunt

Since participants will scan and locate clues and information in physical space during playing
escape room and treasure hunt, I asked participants to take the spatial ability test (Ekstrom et al.,

1976). I used two test scores of spatial orientation and spatial scanning. The spatial orientation
defines our natural ability to maintain our body orientation and/or posture in relation to the
surrounding environment (physical space) at rest and during motion. The spatial scanning is to
visualize a path out of a maze or a field with many obstacles. The actual tests are presented in
Appendix.

I tested the relationship of independent variables and dependent variables presented in Table
6.5. The results of t-test between the variables indicate that spatial capability measured by
spatial orientation and scanning is not related to participants’ performance in treasure hunt.
When comparing TS, SO, and SC based on whether they success or fail (TC), resulting statistics
are as follows: (1) TS and TC: t(30) = 1, p = 0.2; (2) SO and TC: t(30) = 1, p = 0.2; and (3) SC
and TC: t(30) = 1, p = 0.2.

The Figure 6.2 shows the correlation between total test score (TS) and completion time

6.2.5

Gender and Treasure Hunt

I tested the gender difference regarding whether they success to complete the treasure hunt
session. Out of 14 female participants, 9 participants were able to complete all tasks in treasure
hunt, while 4 participants failed. On the other hand, out of 13 male participants, ten finished
the treasure hunt session and three failed to complete the final task.
A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relation between gender
and the performance in treasure hunt. The relationship between these variables was not significant, χ 2 (1, N = 27) = 0.5163, p > .05, (p − value = 0.472423), indicating gender does not
affect success/fail in treasure hunt.

RQ1. Relationship Between Online Exploration and Physical Exploration

This section answers RQ1, which asks: To what extent, if any, does an individual’s information
seeking behavior online relate to his/her behavior in physical space? Findings from data analysis suggest that there is individual preference, or behavioral tendency, in information seeking
regardless the information space: online vs. physical environment. More specifically, this section compares participants’ searching behavior presented in the online space (Web search tasks)
and the physical space (Escape Room).

6.3.1

Evaluation in Web Search

Observing and annotating users’ behavior through recorded video and eye gaze data, 31 participants were categorized into exhaustive evaluation and economic evaluation type. Participants
might have different evaluation strategies for different search tasks, identifying the patterns
between task 1 and task 2 as shown in Table 6.7.

For task 1 of Web Search, problem-solving task, 13 participants adopted exhaustive evalution, while 18 used the economic evaluation. For task 2 of Web Search, exploratory search, on
the other hand, 19 users used exhaustive evaluation approach while 12 used economic evaluation (Figure 6.3).
A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relation between these
behavioral patterns. The relationship between these groups was significant, χ 2 (1, N = 31) =
11.47, p < .05, (p − value = 0.0007073), indicating their evaluation behavior in task 1 and task
2 are independent.
Data indicates that economic evaluation was preferred in task 1 and exhaustive evaluation
was preferred in task 2, suggesting the effect of task type on the evaluation strategy, there a

79

group of participants who kept their behavioral tendency even in a task in which the opposite
behavior is preferred. For instance, 12 participants who adopted economic evaluation to quickly
solve the questions in task 1 adhered to the economic evaluation in task 2, opening the top first
or second result page in the retrieved list without reading abstracts below them. This finding
indicates the existence of highly and strongly preferred and habitual behavioral strategy in
evaluation regarding visiting information patch behavior during online search.
A group of people, who used economic evaluation for task 1 but changed their behavior in
task 2, using exhaustive evaluation, can be perceived as adjusting their behavior corresponding
to the given task. They think the exhaustive evaluation is more helpful to accomplish the
exploratory search. This finding enhances the effect of task type on users’ behavior.

Figure 6.3: Behavior change between task 1 and 2 of WS
Annotated behavioral pattern of examining the online information shows individuals have
general preference to either exhaustive or economic investigation over two tasks.
Tasks that were analyzed here have different characteristics. For instance, the problemsolving task in Web search session was a fact-finding search task, which is assumed to have
the least complexity, requiring participants to use basic searching skills. For exploratory search
task, however, a user needs to spend enough time to understand the topic and requirements,
construct necessary knowledge through Web exploring, and build a narrative that convinces the
potential readers.

80

Figure 6.4: Examination type of user20 in Web Search. Left picture shows the economic
examination during Task 1, while the right two pictures show the exhaustive investigation of a
query session within Task 2.
The observed behavior change indicates that participants tend to prefer a particular strategy
to a certain task type. Compared to a fact-finding type task, exploration-first strategy in an
exploratory search task helps user make sense of a given topic and navigate to a looking-better
path, encountering and collecting more information and knowledge.
For instance, six participants shifted their approach from economic examination in factfinding task to exhaustive examination in exploratory search task: user20, user21, user22,
user27, user28, and user35. Figure 6.4 shows user20’s examination strategies in Task 1 and
Task 2. In the left picture of Task 1, the participant clicked the top one result without exploration
on that SERP. On the other hand, the right two pictures are from one query session in Task 2:
the person scrolled down the SERP up to the middle part, reading the results list, to open a page
in the middle.
Another example is from user21’s Web Search behavior data. Figure 6.5 shows user21’s examination strategies. While the person selected the top result in task 1 without exploring further
below in the results list, when being asked to understand and accumulate relevant knowledge,
the participant spent more time reading and viewing the presented information.
This findings are along the same line with previous studies. Lorigo et al. (2006) found
the effects of question types - informational (e.g. Who discovered the first modern antibiotic?

81

Figure 6.5: Examination type of user21 in Web Search. Left picture shows the economic
examination during Task 1, while the right picture shows the exhaustive investigation of a
query session within Task 2.
and navigational search questions (e.g. Find the page displaying the route map for Greyhound
buses) - on search and evaluation behavior. They found that the general time spent to solve
the questions and pupil dilation were influenced by whether the search task is informational or
navigational.
Based on the discussion above, participants’ evaluation behavior can be explained as follows:
1. Online Exhaustive Evaluator: 13 participants who kept exhaustive evalution both in task
1 and task 2
2. Online Economic Evaluator: 12 participants who kept economic evaluation both in task
1 and task 2
3. Online Evaluation Adapter: 6 participants who adapted, or changed, their evaluation
behavior based on the task type
However, while Lorigo et al. (2006) claimed that the ways for evaluating the results page
are influenced by gender and not by task type, which is not the case in this work.

82

6.3.2

Evaluation in Escape Room

Observing and annotating users’ behavior through recorded video, 29 participants were categorized into exhaustive evaluation and economic evaluation type in Escape Room. Participants
might have different evaluation strategies for different search tasks, identifying the patterns
between task 1 and task 2 as shown in Table 6.8.

Conducting the Book task of Escape Room, 15 participants adopted exhaustive evalution,
while 14 used the economic evaluation. For Movie task of Escape Room, on the other hands, 9
users used exhaustive evaluation approach while 20 used economic evaluation.
Based on the discussion above, participants’ evaluation behavior can be explained as follows (see Figure 6.6 for visualization):
1. ER Exhaustive Evaluator: 6 participants who kept exhaustive evalution both in Book
task and Movie task
2. ER Economic Evaluator: 11 participants who kept economic evaluation both in Book
task and Movie task
3. ER Evaluation Adapter: 9 participants who adapted, or changed, their evaluation behavior based on the task type or environment
4. ER Evaluation Maverick: 3 participants who used economic evaluation in Book task and
exhaustive evaluation in Movie task.
For some reason, ER Evaluation Maverick showed interesting behavioral change: exhaustive evaluation intention before reading the information. This will be discussed in discussion.

Comparison between Evaluation Web Search and Escape Room

Tables 6.9-6.12 show the categorized behavioral types in two information space. Note the
number presented in tables below do not necessarily show the generality as well as causality
between behavioral patterns and tasks in the search tasks. Rather, it should be viewed as a way
showing tendency from a broad view.
Table 6.9 represents the identified behavioral patterns revealed during Task1, problemsolving type task, of Web search session and Book task in Escape Room session. In the
problem-solving task in Web Search 11 participants showed exhaustive examination and 18
showed economic examination. In the book task in Escape Room 11 participants adopted exhaustive examination and 18 used economic examination.

Data indicates that a person does not always show the similar behavior patterns in every

84

task. For instance, while four participants showed similar behavior, exhaustive examination,
both in task 1 of Web Search and Book task in Escape room, seven participants who utilized
exhaustive investigation in online search shifted their approach to economic selection when
viewing books in physical space (see Figure 6.7).

Figure 6.7: Behavior change between task 1 of WS and book task of ER
Table 6.10 represents the identified behavioral patterns revealed during Task1, problemsolving type task, of Web search session and Movie task in Escape Room session. For the
movie task, participants seemed to use more economic examination than in the book task: nine
people investigated the relevant information using exhaustive approach, while twenty started to
look into each information first before exploration.

Comparing the behavioral patterns from two tasks in online space and two tasks in physical
space, participants out of 29 valid samples were identified into groups as follows. Table 6.14
represents the behavioral groups and the number of participants in each of them.
Group A refers to people who show behavioral tendency to exhaustive approach both in
Web Search and Escape Room, while group E means, on the other hand, participants who
have preference to economic examination both in Web Search and Escape Room. For instance,
group A of user3, user7, user23, and user38 exhaustively evaluated results page before opening
a Web page for further reading, they did the same way when being asked to choose and pick
relevant books and movie posters. Figure 6.9 presents user7’s examination path during the
Book task in Escape Room. The participant went through the all placed books in the area first
before grabbing the book #17 on the way back. Comparing online searching behavior, this
behavior can be viewed as a user goes all through the results page down to very bottom of the
page, scrolling down the screen, before clicking one of the results.
There are seven participants in group B, who showed both economic evaluation in online
search and physical search: user9, user25, user34, and user37. Figure 6.10 shows user37’s

While there are five participants in group B, who changed, or adjusted their searching behavior in different environment, from exhaustive examination in Web Search to economic examination in Escape Room, no users altered their way of searching from economic to exhaustive
way - group D.
Group C and F refer to people, who showed consistent behaviors in Web Search regardless
of the task type, adjusted their behavior to the contrasting task type in Escape Room. Whereas,
group G and H modified their examination strategy during Web Search but showed consistent
behavior in Escape Room. Group I can be viewed users who altered their action very easily
depending on the given situations both in online and physical space.

6.3.5

Physical Searching Behavior and Task Type

The annotated behavioral pattern of examining information in a small physical space (Escape
Room) shows some individuals have consistent preference to either exhaustive or economic
investigation over two tasks.
However, as shown in the Web search and discussed regarding the task types, the characteristics of physical search are observed to affect participants’ behavior as well. In the Escape
Room, the way I designed the book task and movie task seemed to encourage users to prefer
particular strategy to the other. For instance, in the book task, having 20 books spread over the
tables in front of a user, I gave her a tip saying “multimedia search is a sub-topic in information
retrieval,” imposing the best way to locate relevant information is select first books that are

89

associated with information retrieval. So, in this book task, it is natural to expect for a participant to look around the series of books, from either end of them, to get exposed to relevant
information patches, in other words, through an exhaustive examination.
On the other hand, the movie task has different setting. While the first thing that the
participant needs to do is locating a movie poster of the film produced by particular studios
(Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures), the letters on the posters are too small to read
from even a step distance from it. So, it is natural for a person to start read the first poster (either
the right-most one or the left-most one), approaching closer to the information to understand in
detail: economic examination or exploitation first approach is preferred in this case.

6.4

RQ1a. Visiting and Seeing Behavior in Online Exploration and Physical
Exploration

This section answers to RQ1a, which asks: To what extent, if any, does an individual’s patterns
of visiting and seeing physical space relate to his/her visiting and seeing in online space? Since
this question is focused on the way in which people visit and see information patches in physical
space, I examined how people visit and see while conducting treasure hunt to understand the
relationship of their physical searching behavior with web search behavior.

6.4.1

Exploratory Behavior on Floors

Through annotating information patches in treasure hunt and the corresponding activities of
participants, I categorized the types of visiting, as one aspect of examination strategy of information foraging, on floors in the building where the user study was conducted. Exploitation
refers to visiting more than two information patches6 , while Exploration means visiting zero or
one patch.
In addition to the exhaustive examination and economic examination, visiting behavior, I
examined the time the participants spent on information patches to view and assess, as an aspect
of seeing behavior. Based on the staying time, their seeing behavior was categorized into three
6 the

criteria of two is derived from the data analysis of all participants whose behavior was appropriately
recorded by the camera.

90

types: long stay, medium stay, and short stay. In order to differentiate their staying pattern, I
used several information patches that most participants visited and viewed as reference points,
such as I262 on the second floor or I363 on the third floor. However, since participants’ staying
time even to those popular patches varied, note that the categorization does not provide statistically accurate differentiation or conclusion. The analysis presented here gives a brief patterns
of the behavior.

Visiting Behavior
The visiting behavior, or examination strategy, was observed and categorized into three types:
exploitation, exploration, and mixed. An example of exploitation examination is presented
in Figure D.1. In the first floor session (2nd floor)7 , the participant visited four information
patches. Fortunately, user3 was able to locate the answer to the first task on the second floor
session (3rd floor) in the second information patch that the person visited, which is I361, letting
the participant accomplish the task even without exploring the first floor.
Another example of exploitative visiting is in user46’s data (Figure D.2). In the first floor
session (2nd floor), the participant visited five information patches, and examined eight information chucks in the second floor session (1st floor).
On the contrary, user38 exhibited exploration (Figure D.3). The participant visited only one
information patch in the first floor session (2nd floor)8 . The participant effectively explored the
2nd floor and found out the answer right way after entering the second floor session (3rd floor).
Annotated behavior of user26 shows the exploration as well (Figure D.4). The participant
visited one information patch in the first floor session (2nd floor) and made two visits in the
second floor session (1st floor). Even when investigating the 2nd floor again in the third floor
session, user26 only visited one place that had not been investigated before.
Aggregating participants’ visiting behavior during Treasure Hunt, Table 6.15 exhibits the
distribution of the behavioral patterns. Out of 27 participants, whose data was valid for the
7 Since the treasure hunt started from a lab (room 222), the first floor session is always the second floor. To avoid
ambiguity, the floor session will be written italic through the dissertation.
8 Note

that even though there are two circles in the figure but the circle on I210 was not considered as visiting,
because the coding scheme specifies three seconds to be annotated as an information patch visit

91

analysis, 10 were identified to show exploitation, 16 to show exploration, and 1 to show mixed
approach. An example of mixed approach is user23’s case. The participant showed very different visiting behavior for particular floors: exploration for the 2nd floor and exploitation for the
3rd floor.

Behavioral Change over Time
While Table 6.15 represents the identified visiting behavior, it should be noted that their behavior patterns changed with the advance of search task. For instance, a participant who started
exploration first in the early stage of search could change the approach to exploitation attempting to get the proper information.
Figure D.5 and D.6 present the first half and second half of search paths of user16. In
the beginning of Treasure Hunt, user16 adopted exploration: one visit in the first floor session
and three visits in the second floor session in Figure D.5. Struggling to locate the right answer,
however, the participant started to visit more information patches. In the second half of Treasure
Hunt, user16 looked into more information, repetitively, seeing the content more thoroughly
(Figure D.6).
There are four participants (user7, user16, user22, and user33) who changed their searching
strategy from exploration to exploitation during Treasure Hunt. In addition to the example of
user16 (Figure D.5 and D.6), user7’s data presents the similar behavioral change. Figure D.7
shows the participant’s exploration behavior for the first and second floor sessions, while Figure
D.8 indicates that user7 adopted exploitation in the later part of physical search.
While the behavioral change is significant from the data and one of the important findings
regarding searching behavior, note that I considered the initial responses in the physical search
when comparing the behavioral patterns in later sections.

92

Seeing Behavior
Table 6.16 presents the extent to which participants relatively spend time seeing information
patches during Treasure Hunt. Since all participants had not visited the same information
patches, this identification is based on time spent on several information chunks most participants visited.

Relationship Between Visiting and Seeing Behavior

Table 6.17 represents the patterns of visiting and seeing behavior observed in Treasure Hunt.
Of 10 participants of exploitation type, six people spent long time to read the information
patches, while two spent medium, and other two spent short amount of time for assessing the
information. Among 16 people of exploration type, one spent long time reading information
patches, while six spent medium, and nine spent short time. The one participant who showed
mixed pattern tended to spend short time for assessing information.
A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relation between exploitation and exploration and the corresponding seeing behavior. The relationship was significant,
χ 2 (2, N = 26) = 9.1274, p < .05, (p − value = 0.01042), indicating exploitation people tend to
investigate information for longer time, while exploration people move onto other patches or
spaces quickly. In this regard, dichotomic patterns of exploitation and exploration can represent
the visiting and seeing behavior during physical search in general.

Table 6.18 shows the relationship between the experience with the physical space and the
searching behavior. The result of chi-square test of independence between the experience
and the searching behavior is not significant (χ 2 (2, N = 27) = 2.0925, p > .05, (p − value =
0.3513)), but Table 6.18 suggests that people who had visited the building before to have some
sense of the structure tended to make quick decisions, moving onto exploration of the space.

The Way Information is Structured and Presented in Physical Space

Treasure Hunt was conducted in an ordinary school building in which faculty, students and
staffs work and spend their daily lives. In this very natural setting, the way information is
structured and presented on each floor in the building varied. For instance, the second floor of
the building, which was usually the first floor session, is organized as in Figure D.9. After a
participant leaves the starting point (the yellow star in the map), the person would go through
the hallway, along with the classrooms and faculty offices. Most information patches on the
floor were office number, name tag for professor and employees, except one bulletin board and
a few doors with a couple of posters or sticky notes. The green arrow shows one possible path,
which is in a linear way.
On the contrary, on the 3rd floor (Figure D.10) there are more diverse types of information
patches other than office labels and small pieces of paper on the doors, such as posters regarding research projects, academic publications, and advertisements of a few student groups.
Additionally, the circular layout of the offices and classroom made participants move around
the hallway, providing higher chance to encounter the same place again.
This difference of information type and the way the information is structured and organized

94

were found to affect participants’ interaction in the physical space. For instance, picture (a)
in Figure D.11 represents user2’s exploration on the 2nd floor, while picture (b) represents the
user’s exploitation on the 3rd floor.

6.4.5

Online Search and Physical Search

Table 6.19 represents the behavioral patterns observed during Task1 of Web search and visiting
behavior in Treasure Hunt. Out of thirteen participants who showed exhaustive evaluation,
five adopted exploitation, seven did exploration, and one did mixed searching strategy. Among
fourteen people of economic examination for online search, five showed exploitation and nine
showed exploration during the physical search process.

RQ2. Relationship Between Aspects of Online Exploration and Physical Exploration

This section answers to RQ2, which asks: what aspect, if any, and how much of an individuals’
physical exploration is related to his/her online information seeking behavior? In order to
understand the relationship between searching behaviors in online and two different physical
spaces, the identified behavioral patterns presented in previous sections will be compared.
In addition to the evaluation behavior in Web Search, this section presents the results that
compare aspects of online searching behavior (Web navigation style and information processing
approaches) and the patterns identified in Escape Room and Treasure Hunt.

6.5.1

Web Search, Escape Room, and Treasure Hunt

Table 6.23 presents the behavioral groups based on Web Search, Escape Room, and Treasure
Hunt. Ignoring maverick group in Escape Room and mixed group in Treasure Hunt, there are

There are two groups in which people showed consistent behavior in all three environments.

97

People in group A are likely to investigate and evaluate information in exhaustive or exploitative way. On the other hand, people in group G prefer to make economic or exploratory
decisions regarding information searching.

6.5.2

Web Navigation Style and Physical Search Behavior

Web navigation sytle refers to the browsing behavior in which the user assesses the online content and information, following a series of opening and reading of links or Web pages. Based
on the qualitative coding on recorded video that contains each user’s query generations, mouse

to have structured navigation style, while 23 were perceived to have unstructured style.
Table 6.24 and 6.25 compare the Web navigation style and the examination strategy during
two tasks of Escape Room game. Note that 29 participants’ data was used for these comparisons. In book task (Table 6.24), of 8 people who have structured navigation style, three
showed exhaustive examination and five adopted economic evaluation in Book task. Among
21 unstructured participants, eight participants preferred exhaustive examination and thirteen
preferred economic examination.

Summary

This chapter presented in detail the results of analysis conducted on the behavioral data from
Web Search, Escape Room, and Treasure Hunt. The identified behavioral patterns comparing
information evaluation strategy as well as visiting behavior was presented. Other aspects of
web searching behavior - web navigation style and information processing approach - were
also compared with physical search behavior.

Chapter 7
Discussion

The dissertation focused on gaining a better understanding of behavioral patterns of individuals
both in online and physical spaces and the relationship between them. This chapter reviews
and discusses the key findings from the results presented in previous chapter, followed by the
limitations of the work.

7.1

Human Information Interaction

I see human information interaction as humans and information competing to influence each
other (Figure 7.1). A human being has its own characteristics such as personality, cognitive
capability, physical capability, personal experience, and social activities. A person approaches
information according to these factors. In the meantime, information tries to influence humans
with its content, material, structure, etc. As a result of the competition and negotiation between
human and information, a person’s information behavior has emerged.
In Figure 7.1, the upper arrows labeled A refer to the influences of information on humans
who consume the information. The bottom arrows labeled B mean the way humans affect
information behavior. Discussion on findings will presented based on this concept.

7.2

Individuals’ Behavioral Patterns in Online and Physical Search

As one aspect of searching behavior, I investigated the way in which people read and evaluate
before they actually start to look into a particular piece of information (evaluation strategy).
First, analysis of video data from Web Search and Escape Room identified related behavioral
patterns in online and physical search. While the number of participants in each behavioral

102

human, and B arrows mean the ways human influences information.
group does not necessarily mean the popularity of the patterns in general population, the analysis found out that there are significant number of participants who showed the same evaluation
strategy even in the different circumstances: exhaustive evaluators and economic evaluators.
Even in a situation where a task by nature demanded a particular approach or strategy to effectively accomplish the task, some participants kept their preferred behavioral pattern. This
indicates one way of a human influencing information (B arrow in Figure 7.1) and supports the
existence of a common algorithm we live by Christian and Griffiths (2016), or a central executive as a search process (CESP, see Hills et al. (2010)). While Hills et al. (2010) compared
users’ behavior in two experiments of spatial search and lexical search to find out the prime
effect - exposure to one type of search task affects the way to address a similar type of search
task, the task environment of spatial search affects their lexical search (prime effect), this work
compared people’s behavior in two information spaces of Web Search and Escape Room.

7.3

The Effect of Task Type and Environment on Information Behavior

While some participants showed their consistent strategy of search process in general, some
other behavioral groups were found to adjust the strategy, or approach, to the given task and
information environment. Even when a person tends to have an innate or habitual strategy to

103

an information problem, it should be considered that the task type affects how to view, access,
assess, and accumulate the knowledge during the task. This indicates one way of information
influencing a human (A arrow in Figure 7.1).
For instance, the tasks that are conducted in user studies in information seeking and retrieval are categorized into several types such as factual task, exploratory task, and abstract
task (Kinley et al., 2014). Each of these tasks shows differences in several aspects. While a
factual task is easiest in terms of complexity, an exploratory task is relatively complicated, in
that it demands a user to interpret the information she encounters and accumulates to create her
own understanding, findings, and conclusion on her own.
In this regard, the task type matters in deciding approach(es) to effectively accomplish
the task. Exploratory tasks expect the user to explore more information before she makes a
quick decision or conclusion, since both the quality and quantity of information collected are
important to the final outcome.
This relation between task type and the helpful strategy in a particular context was observed in this work. People adjust to the task type by adopting the appropriate approach for
the task. For instance, in the Movie task in Escape Room, the majority of the participants used
an economic evaluation strategy to review the information. Even though a person prefers an
exhaustive evaluation in general, the way in which information is presented and provided to the
user influences how to respond to the task requirement.

7.4

Information Environment and Exploratory Behavior

This dissertation studied the relationship between the way in which information is structured
and the corresponding exploratory behavior. Note that among the users who changed their
behavior no one changed from economic evaluators in Web Search to exhaustive evaluators in
Escape Room (6.14). This indicates another way of the information influencing human behavior
(A arrow in Figure 7.1).
This might be caused by the environment they were forced to be engaged in: online vs.
physical space. During online search, more specifically on a desktop in this work, participants
had a relatively small area (PC Monitor), to investigate information to accomplish the given

104

tasks. In general, users can look and investigate different areas in the (relatively) small screen,
with small effort moving muscles such as the ocular muscle, which controls the eye gaze, and
muscles on her fingers and/or hands that control the mouse and keyboard scrolling up and down
the screen as well as stroking special keys (i.e., ctrl+F to find a particular word). Also, when
it comes to the layout or structure, online information is well designed so information scent
(Pirolli, 1997; Chi et al., 2001) is properly delivered to the users, providing an efficient way to
trace and understand the information, with less effort for information digestion. On the other
hand, physical search requires more effort and time of the information user. For instance, in
the situation of Escape Room in this work, a participant was supposed to at least move her feet
to reach out to the information patches, physically grab the books to open up and look into
pages, and sometimes walk between areas in the room to complete several tasks. Moreover,
in our everyday life as well as in the Escape Room setting, information scent is not often
accurately considered in how things are deployed. These different interactions using physical
activities are presented in Figure 7.2. A refers to the ocular muscle through which we see and
read information. B means the activities of fingers and hands interacting with the computer,
information devices, information artifacts, etc. C refers to the activities of visiting (walking
and running), which relate to physical and physiological conditions of a person. D means all
personal activities that happen during search tasks.

7.5

Behavior Range on Different Time Scale

Even though the findings in this dissertation suggest a central executive or strategy of individuals, when showing that the online searching behavior is associated with the physical searching
activities, we need to consider the different behavioral scales. When it comes to the larger
physical space, the relationship between behavioral preference in online search and physical
search decreases or diminishes.
This phenomenon can be explained by Newell’s hierarchical perspective to human behavior
(Newell, 1994). The framework claims that we use different behavioral ranges depending on
what time scale is associated with the behavior. For instance, as shown in Figure 2.12, shortterm period activities such as those that occur for less than 100 milliseconds are handled by

105

Figure 7.2: The Model Human Processor in physical search. Figure in Card et al. (1983) is
modified in the context of the work. A refers to the ocular muscle; B refers to the activities of
fingers and hands; C refers to the activities of walking and running, which relate to physical
and physiological conditions of a person; and D means all personal activities that happen during
search tasks.

106

biochemical, biophysical, and neural processes. As the time scale increases, the associated
behavioral band changes from a purely biological level to psychological, cognitive, rational,
and social levels.
Along with the common executive control (Hills et al., 2010), Figure 7.4 suggests that
information searching in physical space is associated with more factors than online searching.
In addition to the common executive control, a substantial part of searching behavior, other
individual factors such as physical capability (muscles and motor sensors) and whether she is
familiar with the places may affect information seeking behavior.

Figure 7.3: Search behavior in different time scale.

7.6

Human Information Interaction in Search Process

Extending model human processor (Figure 7.2) and the extent to which the common executive
control governs online and physical search (Figure 7.4) suggest a human information interaction model in the search process. White parts in the dotted rectangle refer to the model human
process (Figure 2.4) in a diagram. In addition to the processors and memories of the model, I
added the central executive of search process as a component of human information interaction.
Black ovals and arrows inside and outside the model human processor indicate human information interaction in the search process, as a result of findings and discussion in this dissertation.
Central executive of search process (CESP) induces the user’s innate, and/or preferred
searching strategy, through interacting with three processors (a). While the motor processor

107

in model human processor only takes the orders from the cognitive processor, in this model,
physical and/or physiological conditions of a user give feedback to the cognitive processor,
changing the corresponding behavior (b). As discussed in the previous sections, the conditions
can be response time and walking/running time. C refers to ways the user’s information visiting
traits affect motor processor such as visiting a particular area that has been secured or locked.
In general, the search process of a human being is affected by the external task/information
factors (d).

7.7

Limitations of the Research

First, limitations of this work include the small, relatively homogeneous sample, which might
show similar searching behavior. User studies with a small number of participants can be quick
to conduct, with regard to recruiting subjects, operating experiments or performing analyses to
address research questions but the interpretation of the results is difficult to transfer to the larger
sample in general. Moreover, the fact that all participants of this dissertation are undergraduate
students at Rutgers University can add to a selection bias problem.
Regarding Escape Room, even though I had tested the experiments several times, there were

108

still points that can improve the quality of study. For instance, in the case of the first Book task,
participants were supposed to pick relevant-looking books to start searching information for
solving the question. An instruction to the first question was provided in the problem sheet, but
the extent of individual participants’ understanding of the intention of the task is in doubt.
The investigating of online behavior during online search and physical search is based on
the assumption that examination on the results page Web Search and the corresponding behavior
of searching books is comparable. However, while search results from Web search engine
provided a list in the order of relevancy, the placed books in Escape Room had nothing to do
with the relevancy to the question: the books were randomly placed, and only four books that
cover the relevant topic to the question were placed and there were other books between them.
The naturalistic experimental environments both in Web search and treasure hunt gave participants less control over information they encountered. For instance, Treasure Hunt, which
was conducted over three weekends in December 2016, faced different information patches
presented in the building each day; flyers for different social events, classrooms occupied for
make-up classes, students preparing for the exams, etc. Figure 7.5 shows an example of an
information patch that was differently presented in Treasure Hunt on different dates and times.
These differences might have affected participants’ searching behavior in their physical search.
In a similar sense, some SERPs that participants retrieved during the web search included
more information than others. For example, a search results page about a famous person contains well-summarized information about that celebrity on its side section, which might influence users’ responses to the information and, ultimately, the time they spent on the information
patches.

Chapter 8
Conclusion

As our activities in online space and physical space have been mixed, and the boundary between
the spaces is being blurred, peoples’ information behavior in each environment needs to be
considered from the holistic point of view regarding human information interaction. Yet, while
online information behavior has been investigated with respect to various characteristics of the
(1) human side and (2) information side, fundamental questions about how online behavior is
related to physical behavior still remain.
This dissertation was designed to observe and understand individuals’ information searching behavior in online and physical spaces, focusing on their behavioral change corresponding
to different information spaces, characteristics of tasks, and information structures. While previous studies have examined individual differences or cognitive styles measured by self-report
or survey data, I observed their information search activities through unobtrusive devices such
as wearable video recorders, web loggers, and eye-trackers. The research methodology in the
study employed both quantitative and qualitative data collection, and analysis provided rich
data about human information interaction behavior in online and physical spaces.
The results of the study suggested insightful ideas about how people interact with information environments, adjusting their behavior accordingly. In this chapter, a discussion of
implications is presented, followed by future research studies to expand the scope of our understandings of information behavior in different environments.

8.1

Implications of the Dissertation

This work identified individuals’ behavioral patterns of exploratory search in online and physical space. The findings from the study provide a useful insight in a number of areas of impact,
including three implications discussed here, which would help to improve the understanding of

111

peoples’ information behavior and provide efficient ways of interactions: (1) theory and model
development; (2) learning environment; (3) collaboration; (4) information interface.
This work expands the theories and models of human information behavior. Information
foraging theory (Pirolli and Card, 1997) assumes individuals’ rational economic system regarding cost and benefit, moving between information patches. It also focuses on how external
factors from the environment affect users’ information exploration. However, this dissertation suggests individuals’ personal preference can affect searching strategy. The fact that this
phenomenon appeared in physical search suggests that we should consider physical and physiological factors when studying people’s information behavior. The findings show the value in
interdisciplinary examination connecting theories and models of Information Science to Experimental/Cognitive Psychology and Behavioral Science.
In today’s learning environment, often the focus is placed on the technology more so than
on an individual student’s behavioral and learning traits. The work reported in this dissertation
shows that perhaps we could tailor a student’s learning path in an online environment if we get
to know more about their behavioral patterns in a physical environment. Taking this lesson, a
teacher for instance, could organize various games or exercises, similar to the ones used in this
dissertation, to gain a better insight into each individual student’s abilities and traits, and use
that knowledge to customize a learning path for them.
Let us consider a different scenario. It is typically expected that when people work together
there can be a synergic effect, accomplishing goals that are difficult for individuals. For collaborative Web search, different roles of people (Shah et al., 2010) and different environments
(Shah et al., 2015) have been examined as a mediation method for maximum performance.
However, if the working context includes physical interaction between individuals, knowledge
about the workers’ behavioral traits can improve the configuration of a team. For instance, an
explorer and an exploiter, identified through escape rooms or treasure hunt games, can build a
team to better accomplish certain tasks. Of course, given a situation, it may make more sense
to create a homogeneous rather than heterogeneous group. But the important point here is that
we could use the insights developed from observing one’s behavior in a physical environment
to create an optimized configuration in an online context.
Finally, the findings from this dissertation could have implications on interaction designs.

112

For instance, currently, the information interface in digital devices attempts to provide a user
with a unified interface over different modalities. In other words, they provide similar appearance and interaction on a mobile phone with a small screen and a PC with a large screen.
However, when it comes to the way in which people interact in a larger space, such as threedimensional activities in virtual reality and augmented reality, the design of interfaces in different environments needs to consider the user’s behavioral traits in online and physical space
together.

8.2

Suggestions for Future Research

This dissertation provided some exploratory results about how individuals search for information in online and physical spaces. Even though the findings from this dissertation may shed
light on understanding the behavioral traits in different information spaces, research focusing on users’ characteristics that determine their behavior and factors that define information
task and environment should be continued. For instance, through the experiments suggested
in this dissertation, we can investigate what extent to which the differences different physical
and physiological conditions affect their information interaction. Information foraging theory
suggested the moving speed of an animal determines how long it will stay in a patch, maximizing the harvest. In a Web searching context, Azzopardi et al. (2013) varied the response time
from the query generation in the search engine to see how the cost of interaction affects people’s behavior. In the same sense, we could observe how adding a physical burden to ‘visiting’
influences their exploratory behavior, by adding additional weight.
The tasks conducted in this dissertation have different characteristics: a problem-solving
task and an exploratory search task in Web search, and a book task and movie task in escape
room. The differences between tasks influenced participants to change their behavior and/or
strategy. In order to compare their behavior in online and physical space, it is necessary to
conduct as comparable of a task as possible. For instance, in the escape room, relevant books
to a particular topic can be used rather than random selection, ordered by the relevancy. In
treasure hunt, a task that asks to gather useful information from the environment to produce a
certain type of collection can replicate the exploratory Web search task.

113

In order to test the effect of experience with physical space on their searching behavior, we
can conduct the experiments in a room or a building that the participants have never been to.
To avoid the seasonal effect and consequential differences in environment, we could invite all
participants on the same day. How different information structure influences people’s physical
search can be investigated via conducting a treasure hunt in a variety of places such as school
buildings or museums (Hashemi et al., 2016, 2017).
Further study is necessary in order to gain a more in-depth understanding of users’ intention and the purpose of their behavior during the sessions. Thus, future studies may include
asking participants their motivations and expectations of each decision during a search. After
completing online and physical search with video recording, a researcher and the participant
play and watch the video together recalling thoughts and motivations at specific moments.
Also, further enhancements could be achieved by incorporating additional analysis of behaviors regarding information in different hierarchies, such as Web pages, paper pages, books,
rooms, hallways, and floors. It would be helpful to employ the mobile eye tracker to monitor
and understand what information people see exploring a physical space.

Dear [RECIPIENT],

The research project, Predicting Search Behavior Using Physical and Online Explorations,
funded by Google, seeks participants in a study of information seeking. We are recruiting
participants (18 female and 18 male undergraduate students) who use an Android phone and
Chrome Web browser on a daily basis.

All volunteers for this study will receive a $100 cash after a full completion of the study.

This study consists of three elements:
• Introduction (about one hour): Install (1) an app on your Android phone (2) an extension
of Chrome browser on your laptop,

129

• Field Session (four weeks): While keeping the app and extension installed, fill up questions (about 30 minutes) that will be given to you every week (four times in total) regarding your geographical visits and browsing activities,
• Lab session: Play three games (treasure hunt, escape room, web search task - about 2
hours).
For this, the participants will be asked to visit the lab at School of Communication Information (SCI) on CAC, twice:
• Introduction, on 10/31, 11/1, 11/2, 11/3 or 11/4
• Lab session, on 12/03(Sat), 12/04(Sun), 12/10(Sat), 12/11(Sun), 12/17(Sat), or 12/18(Sun)
Taking part in this study will help to advance the understanding of the search process and
contribute towards the development of theories and search systems that can adapt to a user’s
preferred search strategies.

Requirements:
• You must be at least 18 years old to participate.
• Rutgers Undergraduate student.
• Proficiency in English is required.
• Intermediate typing and online search skills are required.
• Normal to corrected vision, hearing, and motor control are required.
• Currently using an Android phone and Chrome Web browser on a daily basis.
• (Optional but preferred) Using a laptop for daily Web search.
NOTE: students who participated in a similar study last August are not eligible for this
study.

130

This study has been approved by the Rutgers Institutional Review Board (IRB Study E16680), and will be supervised by Dr. Chirag Shah (chirags@rutgers.edu) and Dr. Vivek Singh
(vivek.k.singh@rutgers.edu) at the School of Communication and Information.

For more information about this study, please send an e-mail to Dongho Choi at dongho.j.choi@gmail.com.
You can also contact Dongho Choi to ask questions or get more information about the project.
