ABSTRACT
CONVERGENT INVENTION IN SPACE AND PLACE:
A RHETORICAL AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY’S
MORGAN LIBRARY
This thesis seeks to describe the ways in which contemporary academic library spaces
facilitate rhetorical invention. To observe rhetorical invention in a real space, this thesis
analyzes spatial practices in Colorado State University’s Morgan Library. This thesis argues that
Morgan Library is a representative space of convergent invention. The neologism convergent
invention is defined as the cross-platform and multi-modal creation of a rhetorical text which
accounts for external factors on the creator(s). To describe the functions of the contemporary
library, this thesis uses Michel de Certeau’s theories of strategies and tactics to articulate usage
patterns. Strategies are analyzed through a rhetorical criticism of Morgan Library to show how
the library materially articulates its vision of convergent invention. Users’ tactics to accept or
reject Morgan Library’s messages about convergent invention are explicated through the results
of survey data and behavior observations. In the conclusion this thesis provides some
implications for convergent invention and the future of libraries, both academic and otherwise.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
On September 14, 2013, BiblioTech Digital Library, the first bookless public library in
the United States, opened both its physical and digital doors to patrons in Bexar County, Texas.
BiblioTech offers digital access to ebooks, comics and graphic novels, magazines, audiobooks,
movies, language learning applications, technology tutorials and various databases. Users can
bring their own devices to BiblioTech, such as laptops and ereaders or they can use the library’s
in-house computers and tablets. Users can also check out ereaders to take home with them.1
While more libraries are starting to offer more digital options in addition to books, BiblioTech
takes this to the extreme. There are no physical books available for checkout at BiblioTech. At
first glance, BiblioTech does not look like a “library.” Instead of rows of books, BiblioTech
features rows of computers, tablets and other technology. A Time author states that the library
“looks like an orange-hued Apple store.”2 The employees even wear polo shirts reminiscent of
Apple’s in-store employees. All of these factors give BiblioTech’s physical space an affect that
does not resemble the staid stereotype of libraries.
Even though BiblioTech looks very different from anything that has ever been considered
a library before, it persists in meeting many of the traditional functions of a library space.
BiblioTech’s mission statement directly references the public service, educational and
information dissemination goals of the traditional library. The mission of BiblioTech is “to
provide all Bexar County residents the opportunity to access technology and its applications for
the purposes of enhancing education and literacy, promoting reading as recreation and equipping
residents of our community with necessary tools to thrive as citizens of the 21st century.”3
BiblioTech provides a vital literacy service to an underserved community. According to Laura
Cole, Special Projects Director at BiblioTech, “San Antonio is the seventh most populous city in
1

the country but ranks 60th in literacy.”4 It is difficult for a community to gain literacy and
appreciation for reading without access to material to read. BiblioTech is designed to costeffectively meet the literacy needs of this community.
Whether we may be jealous that our own community does not have a digital library at
this time or are thankful that such spaces will not soon threaten our more traditional libraries, the
existence and goals of BiblioTech, by necessity, raises some important questions about libraries
in the 21st century. Given the quickly changing information systems in which we live, what
constitutes a “library” in the 21st century? Is it the same entity as it was in centuries past? Can a
bookless building really call itself a “library”? Can a person use a library when they are not
inside the physical building? What does it mean to “check out” a resource, electronic or
otherwise? What behaviors are acceptable in the library? The questions above prompt us as
librarians, library users, and scholars to consider how library spaces can be designed to best meet
our ever-changing needs and how to make the most of the space in question.
This thesis addresses the use of space in the contemporary library. In what follows,
Colorado State University’s Morgan Library will serve as a representative case study for how an
academic library in the 21st century employs physical space in order to provide its users with
resources to study and create. In other words, Morgan Library provides a rich place from which
to analyze two issues at the heart of rhetorical studies: invention and materiality. Invention is
the process of creating a speech or other rhetorical text. Libraries, Morgan Library included, are
important places where rhetorical invention occurs. Libraries are important not just because they
provide a physical place for people to do the work of rhetorical invention but also because they
have the possibility to influence how the inventive process takes place. Scholars can understand
the possibility of this influence through the concept of materiality. Contemporary rhetorical

2

critics have moved away from analyzing speeches exclusively to analyze material things, such as
monuments, memorials, clothing and everyday objects, as rhetorical. This thesis will examine
how library spaces communicate through physical space, objects, architecture and the technology
offered within. I will analyze what this materiality communicates to users and investigate the
ways in which Morgan Library deploys materiality to direct users’ inventive processes. I will
discuss the theoretical basis with which I will be investigating these issues in more detail in
Chapter Two.
The synthesis of these elements forms the basis of my central premise in this thesis. In
this thesis, I will argue that Morgan Library is a representative place of what I call convergent
invention. By convergent invention I mean, “cross-platform and multi-modal creation of a
rhetorical text which accounts for external factors on the creator(s).” Convergent invention is a
neologism created for this thesis, which combines Henry Jenkins’ concepts of convergent media
with the classical cannon of rhetorical invention. I will explain both of these concepts in more
detail in Chapter Two. For now, it is important for readers to understand that this definition
articulates how rhetorical texts are created in a media-based society. In addition, convergent
invention adds spatiality to the mix. It assumes that the environment in which a person is
engaging in rhetorical invention, both immediately and more broadly, will affect what they
produce. I am choosing to focus on Morgan Library as a representative place so that I can show
how the trends of convergent invention are articulated in a real space.
In this chapter, I will begin to make connections between invention, space, and media and
explain how these connections can help us understand convergent invention within academic
libraries. To do so, I will first briefly detail the ways in which rhetoric can be linked to libraries.
I will then explain and justify Morgan Library as a rhetorical text and a useful case study. I will

3

also provide an orientation to the space for readers who are unfamiliar with it. This chapter
concludes with an explanation of my perspective on the text and a preview of the rest of the
thesis.
Rhetoric, Invention and Libraries
On first glance, the library may not seem “rhetorical” in the ways that rhetoric is
traditionally conceptualized. In On Rhetoric, Aristotle proffers perhaps the most famous
definition of rhetoric, defining it as “an ability, in each [particular] case, to see the available
means of persuasion.”5 To simplify and summarize Aristotle’s statement, the rhetorical project
has been traditionally understood as persuasion. To engage in rhetorical behavior is to actively
seek to change the minds of the people in the audience. The rhetor is seeking to gain compliance
with their request or secure agreement to her or his idea. It is an intentional and, especially in
Aristotle’s conception, a premeditated act. An effective rhetor prepares for her or his
presentation, thinking about the most effective ways to make their case. Because of its usually
persuasive nature, rhetoric is frequently linked to politics and the law. Direct persuasive appeals
are used in politics to convince people to support an ideology, protest the status quo, agree (or
disagree) with a new policy or to vote in a certain way. During classical times, many people
(nearly all men) represented themselves in the court of law so knowledge of rhetoric and
persuasion was essential to winning the case.
These applications illustrate the centrality of persuasion to the study of rhetoric, both in
classical times and contemporarily.6 By contrast, libraries have traditionally been understood as
places of openness and information access. People come to the library without expecting a
persuasive message, but to explore the works of others. The library is frequently perceived as an
objective repository of information that does not have a political or socially charged agenda.

4

While such a view of libraries may seem noble and civically minded, it is not wholly accurate.
Public and school libraries can be targets for controversy in communities over questions
regarding collection policies and challenges to the availability of certain materials deemed
“controversial.”7 The funding of libraries can also be a critical political question. Even if a
library is not at the center of a controversy, libraries can be conceived as rhetorical artifacts that
both foster rhetorical acts and act on audiences in rhetorical ways.
To better understand how libraries can function as rhetorical texts, it is important to first
clarify the scholarly distinction between spaces and places. These words may be interchangeable
in everyday speech; scholars, however, give these two words different definitions. Throughout
this thesis I will use these words in the scholarly way I describe here. A space is a physical
location in a larger system. This is a more general term that is used to refer to a physical location
without a lot of meaning attached. An example could be a parking spot in a general parking lot.
Unless a person has a reserved spot or a spot in which they choose to park, there is not much that
differentiates one parking stall from another. Disregarding special circumstances, such as a need
for a disabled parking spot, all of the spots serve the same basic purpose. Space becomes place
through the process of social construction. The parking spot may become a place if it is reserved
for a certain individual. While all parking spots are the same size, by putting up a sign declaring
one space for an important person (such as a department chair), that spot has more meaning. It
becomes a place. As Jessie Stewart and Greg Dickinson note, “In real ways, place does not exist
without the human efforts necessary to turn space into place.”8 Placeness adds more nuance to a
space. It reflects social norms about how to act in that particular place, such as not taking the
boss’ parking spot. As Stewart and Dickinson continue:
Place making is a distinctly communicative practice, for it is through a series of (often
nonverbal) forms and sign that places make a claim to placeness. More than
5

communicative, place making gestures are always rhetorical. While the built
environment and its surrounding discourses and embedded practices create this particular
sense of place these objects, discourse, and practices do not make any other particular
sense of place.9
Libraries reflect place-making rhetoric through their design as well as the embedded cultural
practices therein. Consider the behavioral expectations of the library. Many people will
instantly think of the “shhhhing” librarian ordering library users to quiet down and not eat or
drink in the building.10 Such expectations are embedded practices of library usage because they
seem automatic to users. Without an explicit instruction of what to do, the users know what
behaviors are acceptable and which are not. To understand how the space influences behavior, it
is helpful to consider Thomas Rickert’s conception of rhetoric as “ambient.” Rickert argues that
rhetoric is more than a persuasive exchange between subject and object; a person’s surroundings
affect how they act, interpret their environment, and feel.11 The ambient rhetoric within the
library—its architecture, its facilities, its colors, shapes, corridors, stacks, and networked
technology—influences how users act within the place. Identifying and discovering these visual,
material, and discursive rhetorics and connecting them to rhetorical invention fostered in Morgan
Library will be a central part of this thesis.
While understanding the placeness of Morgan Library is important to seeing its rhetorical
nature, it is also helps inform a larger set of questions related to information usage, management,
and access. In brief, I am writing this thesis in response to the information revolution. This
revolution is not just technical, but rhetorical. The explosion of digital technology has changed
nearly every aspect of human life, including having profound effects on the ways people
communicate. As information scholar James Gleick notes, “Every new medium transforms the
nature of human thought. In the long run, history is the story of information becoming aware of
itself.”12 As a scholar and critic living through this revolution, I am interested in writing a
6

chapter of that story. This thesis contributes to the greater understanding of this societal change
by examining where it takes place. I view the design of the built environments for information
storage and retrieval as making an important statement about the nature of these activities. The
spatial gestures made by Morgan Library (as well as academic libraries more broadly) are
making a rhetorical statement about information and the ways in which it should be used.
While I believe investigating the placeness of libraries and how their material rhetoric
does or does not encourage certain forms of rhetorical invention is a critical undertaking, others
may claim these are non-issues in the 21st century. Some may argue that, if information access is
available anywhere with an internet connection and people no longer have to seek out a place to
access resources, the nature of library spaces and places are less important. I argue that the
opposite is true. Being able to access information almost everywhere has radically changed the
ways we use it. Instead of getting into a barroom debate over a fact, a person can just reach for
their phone and search Google for an answer. Social media and texting allow for information
about emergencies, such as bad weather or a dangerous intruder, to be spread more quickly.
Such changes have implications for how libraries reach users, politicians reach voters, event
coordinators reach attendees, and public authorities reach the public in crisis, just to name just a
few. In short, when information can be accessed anywhere, the spaces and places where people
choose to access this information are becoming more, not less, important.
In Chapters Three and Four, I will elaborate how spatiality, materiality, and information
usage come together in meaningful, rhetorical ways in Morgan Library. Within these chapters, I
will use Michel de Certeau’s concepts of strategies and tactics to provide a larger theoretical
basis for my analysis. Strategies and tactics describe power, particularly how people act and are
acted upon in spaces. De Certeau’s work focuses on how the basic actions of everyday life are

7

rhetorical, communicative and persuasive. De Certeau believes that actions which are frequently
overlooked, such as walking patterns, the arrangement of physical space and the ways in which
people interact with objects reveal important information about the power structures in place. To
better understand de Certeau’s principles in action, consider the example of a young child’s
bedroom. While a child’s bedroom may not initially seem like a rhetorical space, through the
strategies and tactics both the child and their parent/guardian(s) enact it can be the site of
communication about larger issues.
De Certeau defines a strategy as “the calculation or manipulation of power relationships
that becomes possible as soon as a subject with will and power . . . can be isolated.”13 In other
words, according to de Certeau, strategies can be conceived as communicative moves a subject
with power employs to promote their idea of how to use a particular space. The child’s caregiver
may want the child to keep their room clean so they provide bins and other organizational tools
to store toys. The parent/guardian also has a great deal of authority over the decorations in the
room. These décor choices can reveal deeper ideological biases of the parent/guardian. For
example, a girl’s room may be decorated in princesses, frills and pink, which reinforces a
traditional view of femininity. Strategically, the parent/guardian is pushing their view of gender
on their child. This act may not be conscious or purposeful, but still presents a rhetorical message
to the child and those who enter her room.
De Certeau defines tactics, on the other hand, as “a calculated action determined by the
absence of a proper locus.”14 By this, he means that tactics are resistive moves by the user with
little or no power to change an element(s) of the same space. In sum, strategies are enacted by
“the establishment”; tactics are how users push back. A child who does not want to keep their
room neat and organized is likely to ignore the bins and throw their toys on the floor in an act of

8

rebellion.15 Similarly, a child who finds ruffles too feminine for her taste may pull them off of
pillows and bedding as a way of resistance.16 A young child is probably not thinking this deeply
about ripping fabric, but the action is tactical in that it communicates her resistance.
Both strategies and tactics are essential for understanding how users actually interact with
spaces. As demonstrated by the hypothetical example of a young child’s bedroom, the bedroom
is a place where the parent or guardian attempts to strategically present their views and the child
has the opportunity to resist. In the case of libraries, strategies and tactics are also essential for
understanding how users access information. A space, such as Morgan Library, may be enacting
a strategy to get users to interact with information in a certain way. Users, however, may choose
to use resources and library spaces differently. To put these abstract theoretical concepts into
more concrete examples, I will address both strategies and tactics in this thesis. Chapter Three
will describe and analyze the strategies within Morgan Library and Chapter Four will focus on
tactics used in response.
Morgan Library: The Text
In order to better understand the contemporary academic library, I will be analyzing
Colorado State University’s (CSU) Morgan Library, the main library on campus.17 Morgan
Library serves 29,500 students including 22,500 undergraduate students, 3,600 graduate
students, and 550 professional veterinary medicine students as well as 1,560 faculty.18 The
facility is open seven days a week during the academic year. Morgan Library’s users also have
access to a 27/7/365 study space called the Study Cube. The Cube is attached to the rest of
Morgan Library, but students can access it when the main building is closed.
The building, which was originally completed and opened to students in January 1965,
celebrated its grand-reopening in August, 2012 after a significant renovation.19 This renovation

9

was initially to begin in May, 1995 in order to provide more space for stacks and student
workspace. The renovation of Morgan Library was underway in 1997 when a massive flood hit
CSU. The flood destroyed a large majority of the basement of the library, including many
books.20 A great majority of campus resources were devoted to flood recovery both at Morgan
Library and across campus. The full renovation, therefore, was delayed.
Like many other libraries, Morgan Library was created in its current form not as new
construction but by adding on to an existing structure. This is a common practice in library
renovation as libraries move between paradigms. There are, however, issues with this approach.
As library architect Fred Schlipf states, “Every time a new library is designed, self-assured
people announce that it will never need to be expanded . . . . These people could be right, of
course, but history is not on their side. Somewhere there are no doubt libraries that are just too
large, but in most cases libraries are either brand new, over crowded, or both.”21 Given that
Morgan Library finished an expansion project in 2012, Schlipf’s comments definitely apply.
The challenges that Morgan Library has faced are broadly applicable to other libraries.
Recent renovations were done with an eye toward the current trends and best practices in
library design and use. According to a statement from Dean of Libraries, Patrick Burns, through
renovation, Morgan Library was to be “transformed into an Information Commons by being
redesigned to support collaborative teaching and learning, and expanded electronic access that is
essential to the conduct of a 21st century university.”22 Morgan Library was redesigned as a
place where people can come together and use information. In short, it provides a contemporary
example of how the trend of libraries as a place of invention is articulated in a real space.
Morgan Library is located in the center of the Colorado State University campus. The
entrance is south of the main plaza and Lory Student Center in a high traffic area.23 There is a

10

large parking lot on the west side of the building. Users enter Morgan Library near the Study
Cube by the plaza. The Study Cube is a two-story cube structure with walls made of mostly
glass. Upon entering the building, users can either enter the study cube or the main library.24
After entering the next set of doors, students are on the main floor of the library, the first floor.
During temperate months, the first floor provides access to the courtyard. Users are greeted by a
three-story atrium. Workspaces are visible on the second and third floors, and there are two
crows’ nests supported by pillars on the third floor. There is a sculpture made of plastic tubing
hanging from the atrium. Skylights and windows provide natural light over the courtyard. The
west wall of the library has a second atrium. It faces three stories of west-facing windows,
offering a view of campus and the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
Upon entering the main building, users are given a choice to proceed directly into the
main atrium or to visit the Study Cube. The two-story Cube is made of glass walls and has
furniture for students to use, including tables, chairs, couches, and whiteboards. Students can
work individually or in groups. All students are given keycard access to the Study Cube
24/7/365, so there is always a place for them to work even when the main library is closed. The
Study Cube has its own restrooms and drinking fountains so it can be open even when the
services of the main library are closed.
Most of the first floor is devoted to work space and services. Morgan’s Grind, the library
coffee shop, is located directly to the left of the door as users enter. To the right, students will
find the loan and reserve desk and upon moving further down, the help desk. The middle of the
space features a large, prominent staircase going up to the second floor and down to the
basement. Behind the staircase is an area full of computers. Users can check the monitor by the
staircase to see what computers are in use and find an available workstation. The north side of

11

the first floor features a few classrooms, some editing bays, and chairs and tables positioned to
face out the west window towards the mountains. Assistive technology rooms for students with
disabilities are located near the classrooms. There is also an event hall near the west side of the
courtyard, which can be used for larger events. Users can follow a hallway left and access the
event room, current awareness reading material, curriculum collection (children’s and YA
literature), librarian and administrative offices, and the reference and law/tax sections. No book
stacks for the general collection are on this floor.
Morgan’s Grind is one of the main features of the first floor. The coffee shop serves
coffee shop standards such as drip coffee, tea, hot chocolate, chai and espresso drinks as well as
snacks, sandwiches, and burritos. Morgan’s Grind also has an express line for drip coffee to
allow users to enter and exit quickly. Like most coffee shops, Morgan’s Grind has tables and
chairs for customers to work or gather in groups. Unlike other coffee shops, outside food and
drink is allowed and visitors do not have to purchase anything from Morgan’s Grind to use the
space. It is even available when the coffee shop is closed.
During temperate months, users can access the courtyard through a door on the north side
of the courtyard. It is surrounded on four sides by the building itself. Glass walls provide a view
into most areas of the library surrounding the courtyard. Students can sit at metal tables or
benches. For those using laptops and other electronic devices, power is provided through several
covered outlets strategically located throughout the space. On the east end of the courtyard is a
large abstract metal statue. Trees and shrubs are located around the perimeter of the space.
The other floors have fewer services and are more dedicated to space for stacks and work.
The second floor is mostly devoted to book stacks, periodicals, technical services, and
workspace, including group study rooms. Acquisitions, cataloging, and preservation are located

12

the southwest end of the building. Archives and special collections are located in the southeast
corner. Due to the Lory Student Center renovation, the RamCard office has been temporarily
located in room 203 by the archives and special collections.25 The second floor also includes the
Ram Kidz village where parents can bring their children for supervision during specific open
hours while they remain in the library. Students have access to the atrium on this floor and can
work overlooking the courtyard or plaza.
The third floor is devoted to book stacks and workspace. Its main feature is the
Collaboratory, an open space with tables, couches and whiteboards for students to use. Lining
the walls of the Collaboratory are rooms for checkout. The rooms feature a conference-style
table seating 6-8 students, a whiteboard, and a flat screen TV. Each room has a sliding glass
door, allowing for privacy and noise reduction while ensuring that no “funny business” occurs in
the rooms. Students can check out AV cables and dry erase markers at the circulation desk to
use in the rooms. The third floor also features a space called “the living room.” It is designed as
a quiet study space and has several tables and chairs for student use. The living room overlooks
the campus and provides a clear view of the Rocky Mountains to the west. There is also a
dedicated silent study room on the third floor. Study space takes up most of the northeast area of
the floor and students have access to the atrium, including a few balcony spaces with tables and
chairs.
Users can also access the basement of the library. The basement contains group study
rooms, book stacks, maps, government documents (both federal and state), interlibrary loan and
microfiche. A sign at the entrance to the basement indicates that the basement is a designated
quiet area. Students have access to large tables and chairs for studying as well as study carrels
along several walls. The basement is the only area of the library to feature movable book stacks.

13

During the 2013-14 school year, Morgan Library is hosting a few displaced student
services due to the renovation of the Lory Student Center. These services include the campus’
First National Bank branch, the cashier’s office, the RamCard office, and the RamTech
workspace.26 The closure and construction of the Lory Student Center has redirected student
traffic elsewhere, including Morgan Library. One student need that Morgan Library, and
especially Morgan’s Grind, has absorbed is hungry students looking for a microwave to warm up
their food. According to The Rocky Mountain Collegian, CSU’s student newspaper, the only
public microwaves on campus are located in the (now inaccessible) basement of the Lory
Student Center and in Morgan’s Grind, leading to frustration for students.27 As I analyze
Morgan Library it is important to consider how these renovations elsewhere on campus affect
library users.
Several notable visual and material elements appear throughout the building, which will
feature prominently in later analysis of the text. First, users provided with various kinds of
furniture throughout the building. Some of the building is furnished with more “traditional”
library furniture including large tables with chairs, rolling computer chairs and study carrels.
Other parts of the library, however, are furnished, with couches, casual stuffed chairs, ottomans
and couches. Second, natural light is a significant part of the library’s design. The west wall of
the library is a large windowpane, providing a view of the campus and Rocky Mountains. Third,
the building has a relaxed policy on food and beverages, allowing them everywhere except in the
stacks, special collections and designated food free zones, such as computer workstations.28 To
accommodate the additional waste generated, waste and recycling receptacles are located
strategically throughout the building. These elements will be further discussed in the analysis.

Before moving on to broader issues of information usage inspired by my analysis of
Morgan Library, I feel it necessary to justify why I am using an academic library as my jumping
off point. Morgan Library provides a case study that can be used to examine trends in one place.
A detailed study of one place can provide insight into what trends may be like in similar place.
A case study can also provide insight into the methods that work best for examining these kinds
of rhetorical texts. In addition to the locational convenience of Morgan Library, I am most
educated and experienced in the operation of academic libraries. This experience provides me
with the background necessary to understand the workings of Morgan Library. In addition,
university libraries, as a whole, are a more cohesive group than other types of libraries, such as
public libraries. For example, in college, I volunteered at the Brandon Public Library, which
served the town of Brandon, Wisconsin (population 950). The issues facing Brandon’s library
are very different from those of an urban or suburban public library. University libraries,
however, are a much more homogenous group, serving similar uses at institutions across the
country. Universities also tend to be innovation leaders so their practices may influence other
libraries, academic and otherwise. In Chapter Five of this thesis I will discuss some ways in
which this research can be expanded to include other types of libraries and settings for
information usage.
Authorship of Morgan Library
When assessing a rhetorical text one of the first things many people consider is the
creator or author of the text. The concept of solo authorship, however, is one long contested in
the post-structuralist context. Roland Barthes’ essay “Death of the Author” contests the idea of
“authorship” as traditionally understood in a modernist, positivist tradition is an overly simplistic
way of discussing the concept. Barthes states,

15

We know now that a text is not a line of words releasing a single ‘theological’ meaning
(the ‘message’ of the Author-God) but a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of
writings, none of them original, blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations drawn
from the innumerable centres of culture.29
While authors (or “scripters” as Barthes prefers to call them), may put the words on the page, it
is up to the readers of the text to interpret those words.30 Furthermore, texts are not created and
interpreted in a vacuum. The text under study takes its inspiration from previous texts and future
texts will take their inspiration from existing texts. Frequently these texts are not just taking
their inspiration from others but directly copying them. In essence, Barthes is making the
argument that texts are not exclusively the work of their authors (“scripters”), nor can a text be
wholly original.
Barthes’ ideas apply to a physical and spatial text such as Morgan Library. For example,
the group of people who influenced the design of Morgan Library did not invent the Library of
Congress classification system used throughout the building. It is a common feature of academic
library “texts” and thus the scripters of Morgan Library included it.31 This example indicates
that authorship or credit for the creation of Morgan Library cannot be limited to just one discrete
group of individuals at Colorado State University. The design has to fit within the limitations of
the university, including space and budgetary restrictions. Existing spaces and budgets,
therefore, are part of the authorship of Morgan Library.
Outside standards also play a role in the way Morgan Library was both initially designed
and re-designed. These forces contribute to authorship of the design. Not only does Morgan
Library have to meet the needs and limitations of Colorado State University, but it also has to
meet standards set by outside agencies. Standards for academic libraries are developed by the
Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of the American Library
Association (ALA). Their most recent publication on the topic, Standards for Libraries in
16

Higher Education was approved by the ACRL board of directors in October 2011.32 The ACRL
Standards articulate the importance of space in academic libraries, stating that, “Libraries are the
intellectual commons where users interact with ideas in both physical and virtual environments
to expand learning and facilitate the creation of new knowledge.”33 Further complicating these
metrics is the fact that the current guidelines were issued October, 2011 while the redesign was
underway. Previous ACRL standards recommended that universities with less than 50% of the
FTE (full time equivalent) population residing on campus have seating space for 20% of the FTE
population.34 Meeting this standard requires a specific number of seats and does not take into
account the differences between individual libraries. This standard, however, was the prevailing
guideline throughout a significant part of the planning project. The ACRL’s current metrics for
assessing the effectiveness of an academic library are less absolute than previous standards. As
the Standards note,
These Standards differ from previous versions by articulating expectations for library
contributions to institutional effectiveness. These Standards differ structurally by
providing a comprehensive framework using an outcomes-based approach, with evidence
collected in ways most appropriate for each institution.35
The ACRL’s current Standards are designed to encourage libraries to make decisions that are
more in line with their strategic needs instead of design choices designed to satisfy a certain
numerical requirement. In this way, the updated Standards return some control of authorship
and choice to individual libraries. The Standards, however, are still an important part of the
authorship calculation.
The Critic’s Perspective
Historically, certain forms of rhetorical criticism have sought to create a distance between
the critic and the critique that she or he is making. In this view, while the critic should be well
educated in how to conduct criticism, their personal viewpoints and perspectives are not integral
17

to the process. For example, in his foundational article “The Literary Criticism of Oratory”
Herbert Wichelns argues that rhetorical criticism needs to become its own field of academic
study, separating itself from literary criticism. Wichelns argues for a critique of a single speech
featuring a single orator, substantially based on Aristotle’s tenets articulated in On Rhetoric.36
This article provides the basis for the inception of the study of rhetorical criticism. It does not,
however, pay much attention to the critic her or himself.
Some critics have gone so far in removing the personal that they attempt to replicate a
scientific objectivity in examining artifacts. As objectivist perspectives began to influence the
discipline, some critics urged the field to adopt a pronounced critical distance from their texts. In
January of 1970, scholars gathered in Racine, Wisconsin for the Wingspread Conference to
discuss this very issue. At this conference, they developed a perspective dubbed the “criticscientist.”37 The proceedings of this conference encouraged rhetorical scholars to look at their
texts from a more objective perspective, which could be more generally applied.
Later critics objected to such an impersonal approach. One argument against this
approach was the turn towards criticism of ideology. Instead of examining just speeches,
rhetorical scholars turned their critical attention to ways in which societal power structures were
implicated in rhetorical texts. Phillip Wander explains the importance of examining ideology
and power in his article “The Ideological Turn in Modern Criticism:”
Criticism takes an ideological turn when it recognizes the existence of powerful vested
interests benefitting from and consistently urging policies and technology that threaten
life on this planet, when it realized that we search for alternatives. . . . An ideological
turn in modern criticism reflects the existence of crisis, acknowledges the influence of
established interests and the reality of alternative worldviews, and comments rhetorical
analyses not only of the actions implied but also of the interests represented.38
Ideological criticism requires the critics to engage their own critical perspectives. Critiquing an
ideology as problematic means that the ideology in question conflicts with the critics’ own
18

ideology. If a critique states that a rhetorical artifact is racist or sexist, for example, the critics
are using their own ideology that racism or sexism is problematic.39 While labeling racism or
sexism as problematic may be obvious to us in academia, it is clearly not a universal value as
racist and sexist thought is still prevalent in society at large.
Further, when a scholar critiques a piece of rhetoric, particularly with diffuse artifacts
that increasingly populate this century, she or he is not just criticizing the rhetoric, but making
her or his own rhetorical text. Raymie McKerrow exemplifies this position when he
characterizes rhetorical criticism as a “performance.” He explains that rhetorical criticism is “a
performance of a rhetor advocating a critique as a sensible reading of the discourse of power.”40
The critic uses her or his scholarly background to advocate for an interpretation of a rhetorical
text, thus making an argument about that text. In addition, scholarly work contributes to larger
intradisciplinary conversations. As evidenced by traipsing through the academic literature in
rhetoric (and other disciplines), scholars like to argue with each other and debate ideas that affect
the methodology and directions of the field. While reading rhetorical criticism, or any other
scholarly work, I believe it is important to remember that the work serves a rhetorical goal in
concert with its academic goals.
As a critic, I agree with Wander and McKerrow and believe that in order to understand
the performance of criticism, the reader needs to understand the critic’s standpoint. I do not
believe that any rhetorical critic is capable of being fully objective. This is not to say that critics’
interpretations are all based on personal impressions. Critics should support their interpretation
of the text with theory and observation, but their interpretations will stem from their own
personal experiences, values and knowledge bases. Rather than feigning objectivity, I believe
critics should state any of their relevant biases or experiences upfront. Giving background

19

information on the critic(s) is a valuable exercise for both the critic and the reader. When I
began to write about my background as a critic it helped me find my blind spots and potential
biases I did not know I had. As a reader, knowing the background of the critic can help me
evaluate what the authors are saying in more detail, considering what I know about her or
himself. I hope to provide the same insight to my readers.
I am not the only contemporary critic with this belief. Various scholars of space and
place have been explicit about their perspectives on the text. For instance, in their article “Ways
of (Not) Seeing Guns: Presence and Absence at the Cody Firearms Museum” Brian L. Ott, Eric
Aoki, and Greg Dickinson begin by discussing their formative experiences with firearms. The
authors used their experiences as a place to begin thinking about their criticism, stating, “In our
nine-hour car ride to the museum, we shared and reflected on what the West means to each of us
and discussed (prior to and following our visit to the CFM [Cody Firearms Museum]) how we
understand and regard firearms.”41 I believe the reader should have a similar insight in to my
experiences with libraries.
During my undergraduate years I prepared for graduate school and a career in library and
information science. I worked at my college’s library in the technical services department with
an emphasis on cataloging books and government documents, both federal and state. During
summers and school breaks I took on other tasks including book repair, circulation, serials, and
interlibrary loan. This experience provides me with the background to understand the inner
workings of an academic library. I also had two significant library research experiences as an
undergraduate. The first was at the Newberry Library in Chicago where I completed an
undergraduate research fellowship. My last library research experience took place out of a
physical library. During the summer of 2011, I researched referrals in virtual reference

20

interactions at the Rutgers School of Communication and Information. This research broadened
my perspective on space and libraries, because many of these conversations took place online
with one or even both of the participants outside of the physical library.42 It also emphasized the
interconnectedness of libraries with other libraries as well as other services or entities, such as
wireless companies or legal and social services.
From the proceeding description of my experiences with libraries it should be clear that I
am an expert library user. Because I am an expert, I look at libraries differently. For example, I
worked in Government Documents in college. From this experience I am very familiar with how
they are organized. I know how the documents are organized (by agency) while this system
confuses others. Because of this experience and expertise I am more likely to use Government
Documents in my own research and writing. I teach my Public Speaking classes about
Government Documents and encourage my students to use them. As an expert user, I need little
help or guidance in using this resource. I have an expert understanding of the documents.
The expert perspective is useful as I try to interpret the space in rhetorical analysis and
through behavior observation. As an expert, I can have the advantage of seeing trends that others
may not notice. The expert perspective, however, renders me less likely to see what others may
see. I may miss areas where others have difficulty using the space (such as the aforementioned
Federal Documents collection) and I may choose to focus on my areas of interest (such as
Government Documents) to the detriment of other library resources. I believe the reader needs
to have insight into my experiences and perspectives to understand my writing, especially in
Chapter Three (a rhetorical criticism of Morgan Library) and Chapter Four (behavior
observations and survey data). I plan to highlight when my own perspective plays a significant

21

role in my arguments; nonetheless, the reader should keep my subject position in mind
throughout the thesis.
Preview of the Thesis
I have two major goals in this thesis. One goal is to explore Morgan Library as a
rhetorical text. I want to understand how this place communicates to users about how they
should use the resources within. As I stated earlier, I believe that Morgan Library leads users
towards a specific type of rhetorical invention: convergent invention. Convergent invention
consists of engaging in rhetorical invention across media platforms. This form of invention also
takes into account the influences that the environment may have on the rhetor. A secondary goal
in this thesis is to branch out from Morgan Library as a case study to understand other places of
invention. To support my analysis of one case study, Morgan Library, later in my thesis I will
examine what other places, such as the aforementioned BiblioTech, can tell us about the
relationships between place, materiality, and invention.
In order to achieve both of these goals I will proceed through the next four chapters as
follows. In Chapter Two I will review the background literature for the project and discuss the
methods with which I will be using to examine Morgan Library. The literature I will be
reviewing includes the history of the academic library, a background on rhetorical invention, an
understanding of communication literature on space and place, and a discussion of how libraries
function as sites of cultural production. Chapter Two also explains the methodology supporting
the project. This thesis is unique because I am using multiple methodologies (rhetorical and
empirical) to understand Morgan Library. In Chapter Three I will conduct a rhetorical criticism
of the space and in Chapter Four I will use social scientific methods (surveys and behavior

22

observations) to describe how people are using this space. The methods of conducting both the
rhetorical criticism and the social scientific research will be discussed at the end of Chapter Two.
Chapters Three and Four are designed to serve as counterparts to each other. These
chapters are focused on my case study of Morgan Library. In Chapter Three, I will use de
Certeau’s theory of strategies to discuss how Morgan Library uses placeness to encourage its
own vision of convergent invention. This chapter will be written using rhetorical methods to
explain the tactics in play at Morgan Library. In Chapter Four I will discuss the tactics in which
library users engage to either embrace or reject Morgan Library’s version of convergent
invention. To engage in this analysis I will return to the themes of bodies, consumption and
leisure, but this time from a social scientific perspective. Through surveys and behavior
observation I will gain a clearer picture of tactics in action.
Chapter Five will conclude my thesis. This chapter returns to some of the larger
questions in Chapter One about spatiality, materiality, and contemporary rhetorical invention. I
will examine convergent invention outside of Morgan Library, the implications for libraries and
future directions for research in both Communication Studies and Library and Information
Science. In the end, I will return to my two main goals in this thesis: understanding Morgan
Library as a rhetorical text and understanding the broader implications of spatiality and
materiality on information usage.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW AND METHODS
In January 2011, the Chronicle of Higher Education published an editorial from
instructional librarian Brian T. Sullivan in which he lamented the impending death of the
academic library as we know it. He begins his piece, called “Academic Library Autopsy Report,
2050,” with the following morose prophecy:
The academic library has died. Despite early diagnosis, audacious denial in the face of its
increasingly severe symptoms led to its deterioration and demise. The academic library
died alone, largely neglected and forgotten by a world that once revered it as the heart of
the university. On its deathbed, it could be heard mumbling curses against Google and
something about a bygone library guru named Ranganathan.43
Three years after Sullivan’s premonitions the academic library appears to be hanging on. Of
course, his prophecy has another thirty-six years to come to fruition. As someone with an
unabashed attachment to the library, I believe that Sullivan’s ideas are unnecessarily negative
and that the library will change and adapt with the times. In this chapter, I will discuss the
background literature and the methods for investigating the contemporary academic library. It is
my hope that this chapter will help inform understanding of the present as well as provide some
ways to think about the academic library of the future.
I begin this chapter with a history of spatial practices in the academic library. To
introduce and cement the theoretical background for this project I will review three main areas of
scholarship. First, I will examine rhetorical invention, starting with a historical perspective and
moving towards a contemporary definition of invention that takes new media and mediums into
account. Next, I will survey the rhetoric of space and place, focusing on materiality and
everyday life. Following that, I will analyze libraries more specifically, placing them in an
important role as sites of cultural production. I will then explore the intersections between all of

24

these themes, discussing how they come together to form the basis of this thesis. I will conclude
with a review of the methods I will use in the chapters that follow.
The History of the Academic Library
Before analyzing Morgan Library in great detail, I feel it is necessary to provide some
background about spatial practices in academic libraries as a whole to provide the reader with
context for my analysis. Library spaces are just as essential to library usage as the collections.
As the nature of the collections within the library changes, the ways users engage with the space
changes as well. Even though these purposes have changed throughout the history of libraries,
the overall goal of the library has remained the same: learning. As library historian Scott
Bennett notes, “From the beginning, libraries and learning have become inseparable.”44 Users
come to the library to learn from the information provided within. The nature of this learning,
however, has changed with the format and type of materials provided in the library.
Bennett articulates three paradigms in the history of library design: reader-centered,
book-centered, and learning-centered, and argues each of these paradigms is tied to a revolution
in information technology.45 The reader-centered paradigm puts books at the service of readers.
With the invention of movable type, books made information more accessible than hand-written
copies, but they were still luxury items that were difficult to produce. Library users had to read
books within the library, so spaces were designed with well-lit reading areas for visitors to use
the materials. This paradigm was in effect from the beginning of libraries until around the turn
of the twentieth century. Contemporarily, examples of this paradigm can mostly be found in
specialized research libraries. One example of this paradigm in current usage is Chicago’s
Newberry Library, a humanities research library.46 The library holds old and rare books as well
as a variety of historical archives. Books are stored in closed stacks and brought to users in the

25

reading rooms and carrels as requested. The special collections are climate controlled and fire
resistant, designed to facilitate preservation of rare materials. Tables in the reading rooms are
designed for book reading rather than laptop use. The space encourages users to read and take
notes on books and other materials with the writing process occurring after the user has left the
library. The Newberry, in short, is designed for reading.
A second paradigm shift happened around the turn of the twentieth century. Books
became easier to produce due to the invention of the paper-making machine, and the readercentered paradigm was supplanted by the book-centered paradigm. Around the 1920s, book
collections grew rapidly and space to hold these growing collections dominated libraries, making
readers a lower priority. While this is not the current paradigm, many current library buildings
were designed around this purpose and they are struggling to convert to the contemporary
learning-centered paradigm. The New York Public Library (NYPL) is currently undergoing this
transition. The NYPL serves not only the information needs of the community but also the
scholarly and preservation needs of New York City. To keep their collection preserved while
still providing access as well as allowing more space for library users, the NYPL is building offsite storage. The changes will create space for library users while also preserving valuable
materials.47 Offsite storage allows the NYPL to transition from the book-centered to the
learning-centered paradigm while still keeping the physical collection available to users.
The third and current shift to the learning-centered paradigm is the result of growth in
digital resources and information technology. The paradigm shift began in the early 1990s and
rapidly accelerated as the capacities of information technology grew. Libraries began
incorporating Information Commons into their designs to facilitate information usage. An
Information Commons provides both access to information technology and the instruction to use

26

it wisely. It is a place for students and faculty to collaborate with each other and with librarians
to get the most out of the available resources. As Bennett explains, “The information commons
requires a fundamental new degree of collaboration between librarians and information
technologists, who bring different professional training and cultures together in newly designed
spaces in support of student and faculty learning.”48 The Information Commons, therefore, is at
the heart of the learning-centered paradigm and this thesis will examine Morgan Library (after
renovation) as an example of said paradigm.
Bennett notes that, “Putting the reader at the center of library space planning is a return to
the first paradigm, with the critical differences that information is now superabundant rather than
scarce and now increasingly resident in virtual rather than physical space.”49 The learningcentered paradigm contains some elements of the book-centered paradigm, especially a focus on
space for library users to engage with resources.50 In the book-centered paradigm, such retrieval
was simple: the user simply had to find the book and read it. In the learning-centered paradigm,
resources are digital and take up electronic, rather than physical space. While the academic
library was once primarily a site of structured individual learning, students are now using the
library in a variety different ways.
This paradigm shift begets several important characteristics of learning-centered libraries.
Users need an internet-enabled computer, either their own or one provided by the library, to
access the resources. The contemporary academic library provides users with access to digital
resources outside of the library. For example, at CSU, users can access the library’s databases
anywhere on campus and can access the resources off campus by logging into the library’s
website. Some students, however, may not connect these resources with the library because they
still think of the library as a physical building with books.51 Because of the diversification of the

27

library, there is a growing view that the physical library building is less important to education. 52
Even though the physical library may be perceived as less important, the resources offered
therein have become more important than ever. Libraries operate in both physical and virtual
space and understanding how these spaces interact with each other is key to understanding the
contemporary academic library.
One way in which libraries exist in both physical and virtual space is that library
resources require the use of information technology. Even if the user is searching for physical
items, such as books, maps, DVDs or government documents, they are required to access a
computer to search the catalog.53 In addition, more resources are found through databases,
requiring the user to access specific online locations. Students continually cite computer access
as an important part of their library usage.54 While these students may be using the computers
for personal use (such as email and social networking), the computers are required to use the
library’s digital resources as well. Providing insufficient space to access computers provides
insufficient access to the resources as a whole.
The library designed in the learning-centered paradigm not only provides an Information
Commons to access resources, but also provides a place for users to come together and learn
collaboratively. These collaborative spaces are where people can come together to engage in
rhetorical invention. Libraries, such as Morgan Library, include collaborative meeting rooms,
comfortable furniture, and even coffee shops for their users. Thus, a social dynamic is created
which encourages users to not only engage library resources, but engage each other. These
amenities come together to create an impression of the library as a “third space,” a space
between home and work where people come together to socialize.55 As Karen Latimer notes,
“[libraries] were designed as places where people would want to come even if, thanks to the

28

impact of electronic resources available anywhere, any time, they didn’t actually have to
come.”56 Users are encouraged to visit the contemporary academic library not just to use its
intellectual resources, but its physical resources as a meeting place, miniature classroom, and
even a cafeteria. Such amenities, even though they may not be purely instructional, may
contribute to the inventional process as a way to make users feel more comfortable and welcome
in the space.
Rhetorical Invention
Invention has been a key part of rhetorical theory since classical times.57 Invention, as
discussed in Chapter One, can generally be understood as the process of constructing a rhetorical
text. In classical times, “rhetorical texts” were conceived of exclusively as speeches. Therefore,
although I take invention more broadly in the rest of this thesis, in the classical period rhetorical
invention is understood as purely speech. Beginning with Aristotle, invention is constructed as a
central theme in rhetoric and rhetorical education. As stated in Chapter One, Aristotle famously
defines rhetoric as “an ability, in each [particular] case, to see the available means of
persuasion.”58 This definition means that rhetoric is based in understanding how to persuade, or
change the minds, of the audience. Invention forms the basis on which many of his other
concepts are based. The three artistic forms of proof (ethos, pathos, and logos) are created by the
speaker during the inventional process.59 His topoi, or topics, are essentially shortcuts to
rhetorical invention. While Aristotle does not use the term “invention” directly, he devotes the
entirety of Books 1 and 2 of On Rhetoric to the subject.60 While Aristotle does pay some
attention to style and delivery, the majority of focus is on invention, leading the reader to deduce
that Aristotle valued invention above other rhetorical skills such as style and delivery.

29

Invention continued to be regarded as important in the Roman era. According to George
Kennedy, Cicero defines invention as, “the reasoning out of truth, or that which is like the truth,
to make a case probable.”61 This definition expands on Aristotle’s ideas about invention while
incorporating the prominence of legal rhetoric. Cicero’s work in developing the five cannons of
rhetoric (invention, arrangement, style, delivery, and memory), codified in his works de
Inventione (and, potentially Rhetorica ad Herenium), cements invention’s place in rhetorical
education and practice. In his main work on invention, Cicero conceives of the five cannons as a
step-by-step process, beginning with invention.62 Rhetors begin with invention before
proceeding through the other cannons, establishing invention as an important part of rhetorical
thought. Overall, through the classical period rhetorical invention remains strong. It is
considered the core of rhetoric and connects the study of rhetoric to the study of the other liberal
arts.
During the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras, however, invention as a canonical
aspect of the rhetorical act became a debated topic. As Sharon Crowley notes when reflecting on
the history of invention, “Rhetorical invention goes in and out of fashion because it is intimately
tied to current developments in ethics, politics, and the epistemology of whatever culture it
serves.”63 In essence, because rhetorical invention provides the basis to develop new ideas and
plays a critical role in the persuasive process, it has often been considered dangerous by the
establishment. A citizenry educated in rhetoric with a focus on invention has the power to speak
against the government. A political structure invested in preserving absolute power has a lot to
fear from rhetorical invention, which has provided incentives to countless regimes, institutions,
and powerful individuals to quash it.

30

The Renaissance illustrates perhaps one of the most severe blows dealt to rhetorical
invention in Western thought. In his attempt to organize the liberal arts, French educational
reformer Peter Ramus dismantled the traditional five canons of rhetoric. He assigned the
customarily rhetorical work of invention (as well as arrangement and memory) to philosophy,
leaving rhetoric with the canons of style and delivery alone. For Ramus, rhetoric (and rhetorical
education) were training in elocution and nothing more. As he notes:
Our second contest was against Cicero. For he had transferred to rhetoric almost all
Aristotle’s obscurity concerning invention and arrangement, and indeed also style,
confusedly making one art from the two, and then applying it confused in this way to the
legal process of civil suits.64
Ramus argues that rhetoric was mixing the skills of invention and style/delivery, which should
be two separate subjects. This split, however, divorces rhetorical education from the
development of content and thus from discussions of knowledge and ethics in speech. This split
remained prominent through the Renaissance and Enlightenment, especially as similar ideas
were later codified in Rene Descartes’ philosophical critique.
However, just as rhetorical invention has faced detractors, it has also had defenders. For
instance, 17th century rhetorical scholar Giambattista Vico strongly disagrees with Ramus’s
splicing off of invention from rhetoric. In On the Study Methods of Our Time, Vico states:
In our days, instead, philosophical criticism alone is honored. The art of ‘topics,’ far
from being given first place in the curriculum, is utterly disregarded. Again I say, this is
harmful, since the invention of arguments is by nature prior to the judgment of their
validity, so that, in teaching, that invention should be given priority over philosophical
criticism.65
Vico believes that invention is a core part of rhetoric and that not teaching it is a disservice to
students. A century later, Scottish rhetor Hugh Blair in his Lectures on Rhetoric and Belle
Lettres again underscores the importance of invention, stating, “Invention, is, without doubt, the
most material, and the groundwork of the rest [of the rhetorical arts].”66 For Blair and Vico,
31

similar to Aristotle and Cicero, invention forms the basis of rhetoric. In the 19th century,
however, a large majority of rhetorical education took Ramus’ approach and focused on teaching
elocution and declamation instead of invention. Meanwhile, invention was relegated in various
forms to the sciences, philosophy, and the (written) disciplines of English and Composition.
In contemporary times the forms rhetoric takes do not remain static. These changes are
reflective of the phenomenon of letteraturizzazione, which George Kennedy defines as, “the
tendency of rhetoric to shift focus from persuasion to narration, from civic to personal contexts,
and from speech to literature, including poetry.”67 In letteraturizzazione rhetoric changes from
primary to secondary forms (i.e. written to spoken) and back again based on the social situation
at the time. For instance, if speaking out loud was dangerous or difficult due to spatial factors,
people would have likely switched to a written form of communication.68 Today, rhetorical
invention is going through another iteration of letteraturizzazione. The primary rhetorical forms
through which people express themselves have changed. While “the internet” was not originally
specified in Kennedy’s definition of letteraturizzazione, media such as videos, websites, social
networking sites and even memes are now important and primary rhetorical forms. Accessing
evidence, synthesizing ideas, and creating content through these new forms has become central
to the process of rhetorical invention for the contemporary moment. These forms also embody
letteraturizzazione because they contextually oscillate between methods of persuasion and
discussion.
Contemporary letteraturizzazione happens through media convergence and participatory
culture. Henry Jenkins defines media convergence as “the flow of content across multiple media
platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of
media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment

32

experiences they want.”69 In a convergent media society, people are not passive consumers of
media texts. Instead, they use their agency to chase (and use) the type of media they desire.
Because of increased abilities of audiences to enact their agency over the media they encounter,
the channels through which messages are delivered become increasingly more complicated in a
society dominated by convergent media.
Another significant change over due to convergent media is the ability of people to
engage with the media as it is consumed. This can be understood through the term participatory
culture. Consumers are not just consuming their mediated messages through a variety of
platforms. They are able to respond and create their own persuasive messages.70 As Jenkins
notes, “Convergence, as we can see, is both a top-down corporate-driven process and a bottomup consumer-driven process.”71 The media producers, the traditional locus of power, still have
some influence on media consumption. Convergent media is new because consumers have the
power not only to influence what media producers make, but they have the power to create their
own mediated experiences. Media culture in a convergent society encourages people to actively
consume media instead of passively viewing it. Social media content is a perfect example.
When a person views something on their Facebook feed, they are consuming the media. The
platform of Facebook, however, encourages users to like or share content that they enjoy. This
sharing can be a rhetorical statement on behalf of the person sharing it. If somebody shares a
post that reveals their perspective on a social, economic or political issue they are making an
argument for others to consider about the issue in question.
The Human Rights Campaign used this to great effect in March 2013, with their
campaign to support marriage equality. People who supported the cause changed their profile
picture to a red equals sign.72 By doing so, a person was able to make a rhetorical statement

33

about their views on the issue. Creating a response to media is a form of rhetorical invention.
As I defined it earlier in this thesis, rhetorical invention is the process of creating a rhetorical
text. This process does not have to be completed on an individual basis. For example, changing
one’s profile picture on Facebook is a small action not requiring a large amount of thought. In
the case of the Human Rights Campaign profile picture, each person contributed a bit to a larger
rhetorical text. If a lot of people changed their profile picture, however, these changes would
affect the look of a person’s News Feed. Each individual contributed a little to a larger rhetorical
message showing that a large amount of a person’s friends supported marriage equality.
Another way in which contemporary convergent invention differs from earlier forms of
invention is its link to materiality. Materiality will be discussed more extensively later in this
chapter, but for now it can be understood as the communicative and persuasive power of “stuff.”
Going beyond speech and words, rhetorical scholars who study materiality examine how
physical things can make communicative appeals. Spatiality is a closely related topic to
materiality, in which the communicative aspects of spaces are discussed. At first glance the
concepts of materiality and spatiality seem antithetical to convergent media. If convergent media
is generally digital, it exists in digital space rather than physical space. In order for us to interact
with convergent media, however, we need to use physical objects such as laptop or desktop
computers, smartphones, or tablets. We need an internet connection which requires the physical
resources of a router and/or cables. Other material circumstances can influence a person’s usage
of technology. For example, a person with a vision-related disability would have difficulty using
various computer applications. She or he would require adaptive technology to use a computer
that a person without a disability is able to use without changes. Without material objects, the

34

consumption and creation of convergent media as well as engagement in convergent invention, is
simply impossible.
Materiality and spatiality also have less directly discernable impacts on convergent
invention. In his book, Ambient Rhetoric, Thomas Rickert argues that invention is not just an
intellectual process, but also involves dimensions of spatiality and materiality. He makes this
argument by examining Plato’s concept of the chōra, which Rickert describes as “an ancient
attempt to think the relation between matter and activity, work and space, background and
meaning.”73 According to Rickert, Plato problematizes the mind/body dichotomy, asserting
mind, body, and environment are not discrete entities. Rickert connects this concept to rhetoric,
noting, “While it [the chōra] does not rule out the use of ideas for invention, which would be
impossible in any event, it does entail that ideas are only part of what occurs in an inventional
procedure, the other parts being choric.”74 Invention, therefore, is not just a process in the mind,
but a process intertwined with the physical environment (spatiality) in which it occurs. Higher
education is a good example of this phenomenon. A Christian school with a liberal theology
may teach classes differently than a Christian school with a more conservative theology and are
both likely to have different perspectives than a secular college. These perspectives may filter
into the classroom in the ways that discussions develop, which affects the ways in which students
perceive the material.
Aristotle and Cicero did not have the internet and multimedia content in mind while
creating the concept of invention. Regardless, convergent media fits into both of their definitions
of rhetoric. A contemporary rhetor is using “the available means of persuasion” when creating a
video she or he hopes will go viral, creating a meme, or developing a new website. Convergent
invention, then, follows in the traditions of classical rhetoric. It is another form of

35

letteraturizzazione, another recapitulation in rhetoric’s vacillation between forms. To account
for contemporary invention and letteraturizzazione for the purposes of this thesis I will broadly
define invention as “the creation and development of any rhetorical text, regardless of format.”
The previous section explains the background behind my neologism convergent invention, which
I defined as “cross-platform and multi-modal creation of a rhetorical text which accounts for
external factors on the creator(s).” This thesis will explore one location where convergent
invention takes place: the library.
The Rhetoric of Space and Place
Rickert’s merging of invention and spatiality belies that this connection needs to be more
deeply examined. Building on the traditional symbolic focus on the field, rhetorical scholars
have begun to examine the built environment as a rhetorical text. To better understand an
environment (the library) in which rhetorical invention takes place, it is necessary to understand
the rhetoric of spaced and place.75 In this section I will describe rhetorical thought on materiality
and spatiality, everyday life and responses to material rhetorics before concluding to explain how
these elements influence libraries.
Materiality and Spatiality
Materiality is discussed in two interconnected but different ways. The first concerns the
material effects and qualities of symbolic discourse. Dana Cloud exemplifies this view of
materiality when she defines the materiality of discourse as “the idea that discourse itself is
influential in or even constitutive of social and material reality (including the lived experience of
work, pleasure, pain and hunger).”76 For Cloud, the effects of discourse go beyond persuasion
and ideas; discourse affects our physical environment as well. Cloud argues that in order to
conduct effective rhetorical criticism using the concept of materiality, critics need to balance the

36

socially constructed aspects of rhetoric with the practical ones. Cloud notes, “Yet, we ought not
to sacrifice the notions of practical truth, bodily reality, and material oppression to the tendency
to render all of experience discursive, as if no one went hungry or died in war.”77 Discourse has a
material effect on life experiences.
The second way in which rhetorical scholars often talk about materiality is as a means of
persuasion separate and divorced from the symbolic world of discourse altogether. Carole Blair
exemplifies this position when she implicates materiality in her definition of rhetoric. Blair
writes, “I take ‘rhetoric’ to be any partisan, meaningful, consequential text, with the term ‘text’
understood broadly as a legible or readable event or object.”78 According to Blair, for something
to be rhetoric it has to be a readable event or object. Blair’s definition explicitly includes the
material as rhetorical. While rhetorical scholars like Cloud and Blair may draw critics’ attention
to different ways on considering materiality, these ideas are not oppositional.
Cloud focuses on how rhetoric creates material realities while Blair discusses materiality
as rhetorical in and of itself. Both of these approaches can be seen as working in tandem at
times. One important place where materiality is discussed is bodies and gender. As Judith
Butler notes, “Gender is instituted through the stylization of the body and, hence, must be
understood as the mundane way in which bodily gestures, movements, and enactments of various
kinds constitute the illusion of an abiding gendered self.”79 This quotation exemplifies both
ways of understanding materiality. The body can be “stylized,” meaning that discourse can
affect how people choose to present their (gendered) bodies. The body is also rhetorical by itself
without any discourse necessary. A person can use their body to communicate nonverbally. For
example, if a person grabs their elbow and makes a facial expression that they are in pain, an
observer can assume that she or he hit their funny bone. No words are necessary to communicate

37

this idea; it is understood purely on the body of the person whose funny bone has been impacted.
In her book chapter “Reading the Slender Body,” Susan Bordo discusses how the slenderness of
bodies, especially female bodies, is read in contemporary media texts. Bordo argues that
“slenderness” is a text in and of itself. She states, “The exploration of contemporary slenderness
as a metaphor for the correct management of desire must take into account the fact that
throughout dominant Western religious and philosophical traditions, the capacity for selfmanagement is decisively coded as male.”80 By arguing that slenderness is a metaphor, she
gives the (female) body the status of a rhetorical text. Both conceptions of materiality as related
to the body provide material ways of understanding gender.
Spatiality is an important component of materiality, encompassing an understanding of
the material aspects of places. As Raymie McKerrow notes, “Space-time structures life, and
through that influence, affects discourse in unforeseen, unfelt ways. Understanding those ways
is critical if we are to explore the freedom to be what we are not, to become what we have not yet
thought.”81 Space and time are structures which affect the ways people perceive their
surroundings and situation. In this vein, Rickert argues that eliminating the ambient and material
context of a persuasive message eliminates part of the message itself.82 To understand material
discourse is to understand the context in which it is situated.
Scholars have analyzed several elements which contribute to the context of material
rhetoric including color choice, room arrangement, and even the directions in which people
travel through the space. For example, Kenneth S. Zagacki, and Victoria J. Gallagher,
examining materiality in the gardens at Museum Park at the North Carolina Museum of Art,
argue that the gardens promote the development and value of natural areas even though the
gardens are located in an urban area.83 In their analysis, the tropes of natural areas contributed to

38

the overall persuasive effect. Greg Dickinson, Brian Ott, and Eric Aoki argue that the Buffalo
Bill Cody museum in Cody, Wyoming creates a “carnivalized” interpretation of the Wild West
Show and the historic conflicts between white settlers and Native Americans.84 Carole Blair, V.
William Balthrop, and Neil Michel analyzed monuments and tombs devoted to unknown soldiers
from an argument theory perspective.85 They argued that the tomb’s rhetoric used enthymemes
to account for the national emotional cost of the missing soldiers. Blair, Balthop, and Michel’s
argument returns the rhetoric of space and place back to rhetoric’s roots in classical theory.
These scholars’ works demonstrate how material space can be used to communicate a message to
the person entering the space.
More recently, John Lynch demonstrates how a space can present a direct argument in his
analysis of the Creation Museum in Kentucky. Lynch argues that space of the museum functions
as an “embodied conversion narrative,” inviting the visitor to physically experience a conversion
to young earth creationism.86 Lynch explains how a room in the museum showing a film that
demonstrates the awe and wonder in (according to the museum) young earth creationism, noting:
“The audio and visual components of the film are the only perceptible objects in the theater, and
their magnitude of size and volume appeal to awe and wonder. The appeal to awe and wonder
continues in the next room with its shift in lighting, color scheme and room dimensions.”87 The
material simulation of creationism makes the museum visitor feel like part of the creation
experience. The design of the space attempts to evoke certain feelings in the viewer, bringing
them along in their (hopeful) conversion to a young earth creationist view.
The persuasive goal of the Creation Museum is apparent from the time the viewer first
hears the name of the place. Not all persuasion in spaces, however, is as obvious. For example,
in their analysis of the Cody Firearms Museum in Cody, Wyoming, Brian Ott, Eric Aoki, and

39

Greg Dickinson find that the museum has a subtler message to its visitors. The authors argue that
the museum presents a view of guns that that, “works to replace (or at the very least repress)
visitors’ individual understandings of guns in favor of a universal (and universalizing)
interpretation of them as inert objects of visual pleasure.”88 By presenting the firearms in a
specific context, the museum attempts to persuade the viewer of a certain interpretation of the
role of firearms American history. Unlike the very obvious persuasive message of the Creation
Museum, the Cody Firearms Museum inculcates an ideological position based on the visual
positioning of guns as beautiful mechanical objects. Both spaces, however, attempt to change
the viewer’s perspective, making them both persuasive in different ways.
Everyday Life
Another important dynamic for understanding the rhetoric of space and place is the idea
of the everyday life. Everyday practices are just that—they are the practices in which people
engage in during their everyday lives. For a practice to be considered “everyday,” it does not
mean that the practice is something everybody does. It simply means that it is not out of the
ordinary or a special occasion. For example, not everyone eats fast food and some people eat it
more frequently than others. Eating fast food, however, is an everyday practice because overall
it is not a special occasion or out of the norm.
Everyday practices interact with materiality when the physical objects, bodies, and
affects collide with the spaces and places we inhabit on a regular basis. As Greg Dickinson notes
in justifying his study of materiality, “rhetorical critics and theorists determined to get after the
consequential materiality of rhetoric can turn to the place of the practices of the everyday.”89
While rhetoric and persuasion may be traditionally associated with speech and words, scholars
have broadened their perspective to include physical space as persuasive. Spaces can encourage

40

or even force the people within them to interact with the space in a certain way, contributing to
an overall persuasive effect.
Examining the practices of a place such as Morgan Library means examining the
practices of everyday people living their everyday life. The phrase “practices of everyday life”
comes from French scholar Michel de Certeau’s book The Practice of Everyday Life. This book
examines the ways in which people use and move through space in the course of their daily lives
and the consequences of these actions on our environment and the people around us. De Certeau
tells us “Everyday life invents itself by poaching in countless ways on the property of others.”90
A person’s everyday practices appropriate their surroundings to make their situation more fitting
to their own personal needs. Scholars studying the everyday argue that these practices have a
large and important impact on people’s lives. Taking De Certeau’s ideas one step farther,
Dickinson argues that everyday practices are not just social but material as well. These practices
affect not just social and intellectual life but physical things as well.
De Certeau also includes rhetoric in his conception of everyday life. His introduction to
The Practice of Everyday Life links the study of rhetoric to strategies and tactics. He notes:
The discipline of rhetoric offers models for differentiating among the types of tactics.
This is not surprising, since, on the one hand, it describes the “turns” or tropes of which
language can be both the site and the object, and, on the other hand, these manipulations
are related to the ways of changing (seducing, persuading, making use of) the will of
another (the audience). For these two reasons, rhetoric, the science of the “ways of
speaking,” offers an array of figure-types for the analysis of everyday ways of acting
even though such analysis is in theory excluded from scientific discourse. Two logics of
action (the one tactical, the other strategic) arise from these two facets of practicing
language.91
De Certeau makes the connection between tactics, rhetoric and persuasion. A tactical act is
persuasive in that it is related “to the ways of changing . . . the will of another . . . .” As I
discussed in Chapter One, persuasion has traditionally been at the heart of the rhetorical project.

41

In addition, de Certeau links strategies and tactics to linguistic expression. While these
connections become apparent in de Certeau’s explanation, they are not incorporated into the
usual texts studied by rhetorical scholars. De Certeau calls the readers’ attention to this fact,
illustrating that while strategies and tactics are rhetorical, some rhetorical scholars ignore them.
De Certeau, however, is correct about the need to study rhetorical strategies and tactics.
We can see this rhetoric at work in typical, everyday action. For instance, the practice of going to
the grocery store is rhetorical. The grocery store uses strategies to arrange its offerings to entice
customers to purchase certain items. Customers respond to the rhetoric of the grocery store by
purchasing or not purchasing these items. They complain to management about problems.
Customers also have the option to take their grocery store business elsewhere. The grocery store
responds to the rhetoric of the consumers and makes changes in their practices. This rhetorical
process happens on a daily basis and is a prime example of the rhetoric of everyday life
functioning in one type of space.
As seen in the hypothetical example of the grocery store, spaces and places of everyday
life frequently send messages about consumerism.92 We consume products both because we
need to (food, clothing, etc.) but also for a variety of social reasons. Some people consume
products to achieve a certain social status among peers. Others make political statements with
their consumption habits, choosing only to patronize companies that match their political and
ethical views.93 Some consumers do both. Scholars generally take a negative approach to
consumerism, implicating it in the maintenance of oppressive social structures, including
economic and gender inequality, environmental degradation, and the mistreatment of workers in
the developing world. These social reasons for consumption interact with (and sometimes

42

overwhelm) the practical, creating a rich materiality with which to understand and critique
consumer behavior.
Materiality is important to understanding how companies can use placemaking moves to
facilitate consumer behavior. In their analysis of FlatIron Crossing, a mall in the suburbs of
Denver, Colorado, Jessie Stewart and Greg Dickinson explore how the mall attempts to fit into
the outdoorsy Colorado lifestyle.94 By using natural rock, the already present mountain
landscape and making design references to ski resorts, the mall feels more like a place of outdoor
fun than one of white, upper-class, suburban conspicuous consumption. In this same vein,
Dickinson’s analysis of Starbucks coffee shops demonstrates how the chain seeks to create a
comforting ritual in drinking their coffee.95 This ritual, however, ignores the consumerist aspects
of coffee consumption as well as the social and environmental harms created in other countries
related to the coffee business. Both of these spaces and rhetorical artifacts seek to reframe
consumerism as a more organic and natural activity. The spaces communicate to the visitors that
consumption, specifically the high-level consumption promoted by FlatIron Crossing and
Starbucks, is a normal part of everyday life. Integrating the consumption into the space makes
the consumption feel like a natural human activity and hides the negative social, financial, and
environmental effects of consumption from the consumer.
Responses to Spaces and Places
These examples show how spaces and places can send messages to users about what they
should think, feel, believe or do. Sending a message, however, is not a unilateral, unidirectional
process. Just because a place is making a persuasive appeal to visitors, visitors will take its
directives at face value. Users are frequently active participants in placemaking activities. They
may ignore or miss certain directions or intentionally resist the directives. In Chapter One I

43

discussed how de Certeau conceived of people using space through strategies and tactics.
Strategies are the methods through which the person, group or entity in power directs user
behavior while tactics are the ways in which users dissent. He pays specific attention to the act of
walking, noting “The act of walking is to the urban system what the speech act is to language or
to the statements uttered.”96 Through walking a user can resist. Users may take a shortcut or
walk in the opposite direction assumed by the space. By moving through physical space in ways
different from how they are intended, users can avail themselves of tactics to resist the strategies
of the place. A hypothetical example would be walking on the left side of a hallway instead of
the right side.97 Doing so resists generally accepted social practices but it may be for a good
reason. The items a person needs on a shelf may be on the left side of an aisle instead of the
right side. A repeated pattern of people walking on the left side of the aisle may indicate that the
design of that area is inadequate for users’ needs and therefore they are enacting tactics to make
the place fit their needs.
Tactics can be further understood in the context of polysemic text interpretation. As
Leah Ceccarelli argues with her characterization of polysemy, not all audience interpretations of
messages are the same. Rather, polysemy suggests “the existence of plural but finite denotational
meanings for a single text.”98 Raymie McKerrow adds to Ceccareli’s definition of polysemy to
implicate power in polysemic interpretations of text. McKerrow defines a polysemic
interpretation as “one which uncovers a subordinate secondary reading which contains the seeds
of subversion or rejection of authority, at the same time that the primary reading appears to
confirm the power of the dominant cultural norms.”99 McKerrow’s conception of polysemy
includes de Certeau’s concept of tactics. As people react to spaces in varying ways, they enact
different tactics in response.

44

In the use of tactics, the materiality of the body can become paramount. For instance,
Bernard J. Armada examined the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee and a
protest across the street. The sole protester was a woman named Jacqueline Smith who wore
tattered clothes and held signs lamenting the loss of King’s ideals, including one stating “Poverty
is Violence.”100 Armada argued that the presence of the protest encouraged museum visitors to
engage in a more critical reading of the museum, rather than taking it at face value. In de
Certeau’s terms, Smith was engaging in a tactic, upending the strategic power relationship
between the viewer and the museum by her embodied presence.
People come to spaces from their own standpoints, which affect their interpretations.
This does not, however, negate the persuasive nature of a space. Spaces can reinforce a view or
encourage the viewer to reconsider their perspective. For example, a young earth creationist’s
view of the world may be reinforced by the Creation Museum, while a secular person would
likely find it ridiculous. A space such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial can have multiple
meanings to one person or different meanings to different people, which helps explain the
societal context in which it is situated. As Carole Blair, Marcia Jeppeson and Enrico Pucci state
about the Memorial, it “does not suggest one reading or the other, but embraces even
contradictory interpretations. The Memorial both comforts and refuses to comfort. It both
provides closure and denies it. It does not offer a unitary message but multiple and conflicting
ones.”101 In this way, the monument to the veterans reflects public views and sentiment about
the Vietnam War. Other spaces can have different meanings to various groups. Thomas R.
Dunn explored how an article of material rhetoric can be read differently by multiple groups in
his reading of the statue of Alexander Wood, the victim of a gay sex scandal in the early 1800s,
in downtown Toronto. Dunn argued that interpretation of the statue through multiple

45

perspectives was necessary to understand the statue because it had multiple meanings for
different audiences. Dunn notes, “It becomes incumbent to recognize both the official and
resistive readings that are made possible in the statue and that collectively inform its
meaning(s).”102 Understanding the complexity of the discourse created by the statue requires the
perspectives of multiple voices.
The study of spaces, places, and materiality as rhetorical adds new layers to the study of
rhetorical scholarship. These messages are particularly important to understanding Morgan
Library because studying these types of artifacts complicates our notions of persuasion. Except
in very rare cases, such as the Creation Museum, spaces and places lack directly persuasive
messages. Instead the messages of a space or place are more subtle and indirect. Such messages
can have just as strong of an effect on the audience receiving them. When people are viewing a
space or interacting with a place they are not expecting to be persuaded. Their guards are down
which makes them more susceptible to the persuasive messages of a space or place. Just like
George Pullman states, “As with all other forms of persuasion, subtlety begets success. You
have to disarm before you can charm.”103 It is important to consider libraries in this context. As
I discussed in Chapter One, most people do not consider the library to have a persuasive or
rhetorical message. As they enter it, therefore, their defenses are down. Library users, therefore,
are predisposed to perceive of the library as ideologically neutral, when in fact, it is not.
Libraries as Sites of Cultural Production
One way in which libraries entrench epistemic values is through preservation and
presentation of material. In addition to considering the physical and material space as a site of
power and knowledge, this thesis will delve into larger issues surrounding information and
power. Morgan Library will be considered in the larger context of both physical archives and the

46

Foucauldian conception of the archive. Both scholars and everyday library practitioners have the
power to understand, critique and influence ideology. These goals can be accomplished by
taking an approach in which an individual reflects on the cultural products and practices present
in their object of study and considers the larger societal implications thereof. This thought
process is called praxis and it is found in the scholarship regarding both rhetoric and library and
information science.
Raymie McKerrow reinvigorated the concept of praxis in rhetorical studies, advocating
for a postmodern turn in rhetorical criticism that focused on “twin critiques of domination and
freedom.”104 McKerrow argued that critical rhetorical scholarship should critique both
domination and freedom, demonstrating how the discourse under study functioned to promote
and/or repress certain ideologies. Rather than a back-and-forth struggle, McKerrow conceives of
power as fluid, flowing among different individuals and/or institutions. It is the job of the critic
to examine the implications of the discourse, uncovering the ethical implications of social
systems. A similar conception of praxis exists in library and information science. Library and
Information Science scholar John Budd defines praxis as “the critical, rational, interpretive,
epistemic, and ethical work of a discipline or profession. Praxis refers to action that carries
social and ethical implications and is not reducible to technical performance of tasks.”105 Budd
believes that a true praxis (as opposed to practice) of library and information science requires not
just an ability to answer reference queries and catalog resources, but the desire to reflect upon
these activities for their ethical implications.
Praxis can be considered in the context of two definitions of the archive. When
considering the definition of “archive,” information professionals and the general public likely
think of a place to store documents. Archival practioners define their work as a material storage

47

location. As archival scholar Laura A. Miller notes, “Archives are that small portion of all the
information, communications, ideas and opinions people generate that are recorded and kept.
Archives are tangible products, whether they are physical or electronic, visual, aural or written.
Archives must exist in some concrete form in order to be preserved and used.”106 Miller’s
definition places archives in a very specific cultural role. Archival work is focused on the
technical task of making information accessible.
While this is one definition of an archive, it is limiting in its scope. The archive also has
a social dimension. Michel Foucault provides a more expansive definition of the power, scope,
and relevance of the archive:
The archive is first the law of what can be said, the system that governs the appearance of
statements as unique events. But the archive is also that which determines that all these
things said do not accumulate endlessly in an amorphous mass, nor are they inscribed in
an unbroken linearity, nor do they disappear at the mercy of chance external accidents;
but they are grouped together in distinct figures, composed together in accordance with
specific regularities; that which determined that they do not withdraw at the same pace in
this, but shine, as it were, like stars, some that seem close to use shining brightly from
afar off, while others that are in fact close to use are already growing pale.107
According to Foucault, the archive is more than just a climate controlled room and white gloves;
it is what is perceived to be the entirety of human knowledge. Foucault argues that in order for
human knowledge (“the archive”) to be functional, it must be organized. Such organization,
however, distorts the contents of the archive, making some pieces more apparent than others. In
this way, archival spaces like libraries have deeply rhetorical natures in that, as Kenneth Burke
claims, they select, deflect, and reflect particular social assumptions.108 In this way, the archive is
also a site of power; within the archive, multiple forces of power engage in a fluid exchange
making ideas more or less visible within the archive.
Foucault’s archive is more than physical or digital storage; it is a socially constructed
representation of memory and reality that contains ideas ranging from scientific research to
48

everyday, common sense knowledge. Rhetorical scholars need to access the archive to
understand the texts they examine or produce, thus making the archive an essential part of the
inventional process. Even the most basic rhetorical criticism—a Neo-Classical analysis of one
speaker and one speech—requires accessing the broader historical archive. To assess if a
speaker thoroughly understood “the available means of persuasion,” the critic needs to know
what means of persuasion were available: information found within the archive. As Barbara A.
Biesecker states, “[the archive] always already is the provisionally settled scene of our collective
invention, of our collective invention of us and of it.”109 The archive is a privileged and
incomplete record of the ideas, conversations, and ideology of humanity, and its power comes
from disseminating its contents.
To understand Morgan Library as an archive, both interpretations of the archive need to
be considered. Morgan Library does serve the practical functions of the archive Miller describes.
It stores information and provides a mechanism for retrieval. Applying the Foucauldian lens to
the practical function, the choices the faculty and staff at Morgan Library make about how to
store and retrieve information affect what information is more or less apparent. In the context of
the physical environment at Morgan Library, the faculty and staff are making rhetorical, placemaking moves affecting the practical usage of the library.
Returning to issues of space and place in libraries, both practical and critical, the spaces
in which users access the archive become part of the archive themselves. A library is part of the
larger Foucauldian conception of the archive. For students, staff, and faculty at Colorado State
University, Morgan Library provides much of their access to the greater archive, placing the
library in a position of power within the institution. In concordance with a Foucauldian
conception of power, it is important to note that Morgan Library provides access to not just

49

scholarly knowledge but “everyday, common sense” as well. Users approaching the help desk or
setting an appointment with a librarian to discuss their research are accessing the library staff’s
knowledge of research techniques. The research skills taught to a library user affect how they
use Morgan Library and other information sources going forward. Strategically, places of
archival reference, such as Morgan Library, can make a rhetorical statement about their view of
the “correct” way(s) to use information by presenting the archive in a certain way. For example,
Morgan Library has moved the general stacks off of the main floor of the library and made other
design elements, such as computer spaces, comfortable furniture, the help desk, and Morgan’s
Grind more prominent parts of the visual field. This can communicate the archival priorities of
Morgan Library to visitors. Considering these varying conceptions of power requires a critical
praxis to understand how Morgan Library (or any library) affects its users’ conceptions of the
larger archive.
Synthesis: The Larger Themes
In this thesis I will consider the seemingly disparate concepts of invention, space and
place, and cultural production as closely linked. By reviewing the literature, it is understood that
invention is not an isolated process. A person or group of people engaging in rhetorical
invention needs to be located somewhere in physical or digital space. They need to be using
some form of material object to record their thoughts which can range from a notebook and pen
to a laptop computer to a powerful desktop computer designed for video editing. As people
engage in rhetorical invention they are creating their own rhetorical text and usually interacting
with the rhetorical texts of others in a cycle of cultural production. And where does that cycle
occur? In some sort of built environment.

50

Invention, convergent or otherwise, cannot occur without spatiality. In the contemporary
moment, however, it may seem strange to think of invention, especially convergent invention, as
spatially bound. All a person needs to invent is a computer (or a phone or a tablet) and,
depending on the battery life, a power source. For example, as a graduate student in a college
town, I have several choices about where to put my laptop and write my thesis. I can sit
anywhere in my apartment, at one of the four coffee shops within walking distance, in my office
or various places on campus. Even some of the local bars have WiFi and power sources. This
variety of choices of spaces to convergently invent means that my inventional experience is very
bound to spatiality. Every time I open my laptop to work I am actively deciding in what space I
wish to invent, even if it is simply a choice between the kitchen table and the couch. The themes
in this literature review of rhetorical invention, space and place, and cultural production interact
with each other, reinforcing and changing themselves. To think of them distinctly is to not think
of them at all.
Rhetorical and Empirical Methods
As stated earlier, Chapter Three is a rhetorical analysis of Morgan Library and Chapter
Four discusses the results of behavior observations and survey data about library usage.
Therefore, it is accurate to think of this thesis as using an empirical mixed-methods approach.
While I will use the term “empirical” to refer to the research methods present in Chapter Four to
distinguish them from the rhetorical methods in Chapter Three, I wish to emphasize that I am not
discounting rhetorical criticism as an empirical activity. I am, instead, using the word
“empirical” as a shorthand label for the survey and behavior observation methodology used in
Chapter Four.

51

Methods in Conversation
Electing to use a mixed-methodology for a project with strong rhetorical elements is
relatively uncommon within the Communication Studies discipline. Many scholars prefer to
focus their research in either rhetorical or social scientific methodologies. I, however, believe
that the divide between the applications of these approaches is unnecessarily wide. Other
scholars have attempted to bring together rhetorical and social scientific methodologies with
successful results. For example, research in cognitive linguistics (a field allied with
communication studies) has taken a social scientific approach to study how people perceive
metaphors, a traditionally rhetorical text.110 Similarly, John A. Bateman argues that effectively
analyzing “page-based documents” such as magazines, webpages and newspapers requires
empirical analysis of the page layout and that empirically analyzing these elements uncovers
rhetorical appeals about organization.111 While these approaches are not mainstream, they do
provide evidence that research which incorporates both rhetorical work and social
scientific/empirical methodologies can be epistemologically productive.
I chose to conduct my thesis research using multiple methodologies for two reasons.
First, I wanted to use the empirical methods to develop the criticism and vice versa. For
example, some of the data gathered from behavior observations (such as library users moving
furniture) influenced the critical work. I used some of the critical work, specifically de Certeau’s
concepts of strategies and tactics, to influence how I wrote the survey. For example, one
question asked what people do in the library other than schoolwork to gauge what types of
strategies they may be using. While Chapters Three and Four are distinct from each other, their
thought processes do overlap. This is especially reflected in the organization of each of these

52

chapters. Chapter Four discusses the same rhetorical themes of Chapter Three, allowing readers
(and myself as a writer) to make a close link between the criticism and empirical work.
Previous scholars have attempted to link rhetorical criticism and empirical work in
different ways. One attempt was the prescientific notion of rhetorical criticism in which a
scholar would attempt to use rhetorical criticism to predict potential research questions for
empirical study. In John Waite Bowers’ view the prescientific approach to rhetorical criticism
means that critics think of ideas that are later tested using more scientific methods. He states,
“the rhetorical critic’s principal task is to produce testable hypotheses which, when verified, will
have the status of scientific laws. It ignores, though it does not prohibit, the critic’s evaluative
activities.”112 If this criticism were done in the prescientific way, Chapter Three (the criticism)
would inform the questions asked in Chapter Four (the empirical data) and the results in Chapter
Three would be tested by and bound to the results in Chapter Four.
My approach differs from the prescientific notion of rhetorical criticism. Instead this
thesis uses rhetorical criticism as an empirical activity to tell the reader something about the
world. Rhetorical criticism stands on its own instead of being the precursor to empirical work.
The empirical research, however, acknowledges that rhetorical texts do not come preconstructed. As Michael Calvin McGee notes:
Critical rhetoric does not begin with a finished text in need of interpretation; rather, texts
are understood to be larger than the apparently finished discourse that presents itself as
transparent. The apparently finished discourse is in fact a dense reconstruction of all the
bits of other discourses form which it was made. It is fashioned from what we can call
“fragments.”113
According to McGee, the critic needs to first create “the text” before analyzing it. Rhetorical
texts do not exist in a vacuum; even a text that seems cut and dry (like a single speech) has
context surrounding it that the critic needs to take into account. Morgan Library and the

53

practices within, of course, are not as simple of a rhetorical text. This is evident when returning
to Carole Blair’s definition of rhetoric as discussed in the literature review. She states, “I take
‘rhetoric’ to be any partisan, meaningful, consequential text, with the term ‘text’ understood
broadly as a legible or readable event or object.”114 Taking Blair’s definition and putting it into
conversation with de Certeau’s strategies and tactics, a tactic becomes a meaningful text. A
student engaging in a tactic of taking a nap in the library becomes both meaningful and a
readable text under Blair’s conception of rhetoric. Students’ usage of Morgan Library, therefore,
is a rhetorical text. This usage, however, cannot be read as a rhetorical text until all of the little
pieces of data are put together in an aggregate—that is, until I as the critic assemble the
fragments needed to turn individual naps, coffee purchases, group meetings, social networking,
Netflix viewing, and socialization into the rhetorical text of Morgan Library. In this thesis I use
the empirical research methods described above to access the fragments to create the rhetorical
text. It is a symbiotic, not pre-scientific, relationship.
The second reason I wrote this thesis using multiple methodologies was to conduct an
epistemological and methodological experiment. I am attempting to bring critical and empirical
methodologies in close conversation with each other. As I write, I am interested in not only the
insights these methods provide about Morgan Library, but the insights this methodological
choice can provide. As McGee prophesizes, “I think it is time to stop whining about the socalled ‘post-modern condition’ and to develop realistic strategies to cope with it as a fact of
human life, perhaps in the present, certainly in the not-too-distant twenty-first century.”115 In
1990 McGee is predicting that as we move through time towards the twenty-first century texts
will become more fragmented and that rhetorical scholars will need to develop critical
perspectives to deal with these texts. That century is here. In this thesis I am taking up McGee’s

54

challenge and trying one method to deal with an increasingly fragmented contemporary
condition. In the conclusion (Chapter Five) of the thesis I will return to the methods section and
comment upon the insights that can be gleaned by putting these methods together and potential
future directions for research.
Rhetorical Methods
Chapter Three will be a rhetorical analysis of Morgan Library. This analysis will focus
on the strategies (to use de Certeau’s term) of Morgan Library. In conducting my rhetorical
analysis of the library I am not using a specific methodology pulled from a textbook. My initial
methodological inspiration was close-textual criticism, described by Carl R. Burgchardt as:
“Look at the text and say something smart.”116 Using my expert knowledge of libraries, I
decided to apply the tenets of close-textual reading to Morgan Library.
To apply this method more effectively, I observed other scholars following this same
path. One of the core articles I used to inform my analysis was Blair, Jeppeson and Pucci’s
article “Public Memorializing in Postmodernity: the Vietnam Veterans’ Memorial as Prototype.”
This article was one of the first to conduct a study of a memorial as a rhetorical text and provided
a model of how to do a rhetorical criticism of a non-traditional text. Another key inspiration was
the work of Greg Dickinson. I was fortunate to take a class with him, “The Rhetoric of Everyday
Life,” in the Fall of 2013 and his leadership of the discussions in that class shaped my view of
materiality and spatiality.117 His academic work also provided a model for how to think about
and conduct this kind of research. His article “Joe’s Rhetoric: Finding Authenticity at
Starbucks” was a useful case study in how to analyze the rhetoric of a specific place. After taking
this inspiration, I attempted to follow another one of Dr. Burgchardt’s suggestions: “Say
something that is not obvious.” These edicts guided my reading of Morgan Library in Chapter 3.

55

Empirical methods
In addition to methods of rhetorical criticism and in order to better assess how students
are using the library, I applied empirically based methods to observe and categorize behavior,
specifically surveys and behavior observations. While Chapter Three focused on the strategies
of Morgan Library, Chapter Four was devoted to how users respond to these strategies. Both the
survey and behavior observations were designed to provide access to the users’ tactics.
Survey
Surveys (Appendix II) were distributed to public speaking students during February,
2014.118 I sent each public speaking instructor an email with a brief description of the project, a
link to the survey, and a six-digit confirmation code to check student participation. Instructors
were asked to reply to the email if they gave the survey out to their classes and to tell me the
section numbers they taught, the number of students in the section and how much, if any, extra
credit was given for participation. The email was sent on February 6, 2014 and the survey closed
on February 28, 2014. Public speaking students were chosen as the sample population because
public speaking is the basic communication course at Colorado State University and draws a
broad variety of students from other departments. It is commonly accepted practice to use
students in basic courses as research subjects in the social sciences and humanities so this
sampling practice fits with other researchers’ techniques.
The survey begins with an informed consent document. Page two asks how frequently
students use different locations and services in the library. Students can choose “daily,” “1-3
times per week,” “weekly,” “once or twice per month,” “once or twice per semester” or “never.”
Using the same options for frequency, page two asks students how frequently they use the library
overall and at different time periods: morning (6am-noon), afternoon (noon-6pm), evening (6pm-

56

midnight) and night (midnight-6am). Students are then asked their three favorite locations in the
library. The page also asks what other locations they use to do research, study alone and study
with others and for what other purposes they use the library. The final page asks for
demographic information including class year, major, where they are from, their gender and if
they have any disabilities which may affect their use of the library. At the end of the survey,
participants are given a 6-digit code to email to their instructor to confirm they have taken the
survey without compromising their anonymity.
This survey is designed to be anonymous to get honest answers from students. There are
several reasons to believe student might distort their answers if not given anonymously. Some
students may feel that library usage is a “good” thing and thus exaggerate their library usage,
especially if their instructor has access to their responses. In addition, the research is designed to
get at tactics in the library. Page two asks, “What do you do in Morgan Library besides study or
research? Please be as detailed as possible in your response. Your answers are anonymous so
please feel free to be honest.” Students who use the library for activities other than what they
perceive to be its “intended purpose” may not answer honestly. The question is designed to get
at behavior ranging from napping to more frowned-upon activities such as viewing pornography,
drinking alcohol or having sexual encounters. Such activities, however, are an important part of
understanding library usage and should be discussed honestly.
Behavior Observations
Behavior observations were conducted as another way to understand users’ behavior.
The observations were designed to provide insight into how users interacted with each other and
their environment. One of the important tactics I wished to observe was the use of furniture in
different and unintended ways. Overall, I was curious about how people repurposed their

57

environment. It would be difficult to ask people to self-report these behaviors as they may do
them without thinking. Behavior observations, therefore, were the most effective way to
understand these tactics.
I began conducting behavior observations January 22, 2014 and continued through
February 28, 2014. I scheduled 3-5 hours of observations per week at times ranging from 8am to
8pm. Due to my unavailability for several weekends, I did not conduct any weekend
observations. During my observations I sat in various areas of the library for times ranging from
10-20 minutes. I took handwritten notes on the behavior I observed, the personal lens through
which I was interpreting the behavior, and my interpretation of the behavior. If I found
something unique and interesting I took a picture of it to add to the thesis.119 To protect the
privacy of students I did not record observations of what was on a person’s computer screen. I
also did not observe private behavior, such as what students check out, behavior in the restroom
and any private interactions between students and staff or between staff members. All behavior
observed was public.
While observing I was not looking for large, overarching patterns in library usage across
times of the semester and times of day. I did not have enough observational time to adequately
develop that depth of information. What I was looking for, however, were smaller pieces of
everyday life. I was curious about things like where students chose to take a nap in the library, if
they left their work on the whiteboards and the ways in which they moved furniture. Behavior
observations are uniquely positioned to capture these moments of usage.
Conclusion
Brian T. Sullivan may have predicted the death of the academic library, but the online
responses to his article in The Chronicle of Higher Education indicate that many academic

58

librarians disagree. Bess Sadler, a librarian at Stanford University, took exception to his
arguments. She stated:
I think the author has mistaken transformation for death. Academic libraries have indeed
undergone huge changes in the kinds of services they offer, but for every service no
longer needed, other services for which there is more demand have taken their place.
Statistics specialists, digital humanities design consultants, computational research
experts, subject specialists in emerging fields like nanotechnology engineering, these are
just a few of the librarians I have worked with in the past few years. I'm a librarian, but it
might not be obvious at first glance, because I’m also a software engineer working on
ways for research teams at Stanford (and elsewhere! All our software is open source) to
put their research data on deposit at the library for long-term preservation.
Librarianship is re-inventing itself, but it’s far from dead.120
Her comments, and the comments of many others on the article, indicated that librarianship is
not a stagnant profession, but an evolving one. Librarians will continue to adapt to new
technology rather than sticking to the old.
In this chapter, I provided a summary of the literature that helps inform the questions I
am asking in this thesis. I reviewed information on the history of academic libraries, rhetorical
invention, the rhetoric of space and place and examined libraries as sites of cultural production. I
also discussed the rhetorical and empirical methodologies I will be using to answer questions
about Morgan Library. In the next chapter, I will begin the analysis work, examining how the
creators of Morgan Library envisioned convergent rhetorical invention in the twenty-first
century.

CHAPTER THREE: MORGAN LIBRARY AS A STRATEGIC SPACE OF CONVERGENT
INVENTION

When scholars talk of “everyday life” they are generally not taking this phrase literally.
As discussed in the previous chapter, “everyday life” consists of daily practices, such as going to
the grocery store, driving a car, or going to a job. There are, however, some practices that are
literally “every day.” One of those practices is using the bathroom. For many people this
activity does not necessitate a second thought. For others, particularly those who are disabled or
queer, public restrooms can pose many difficulties. For instance, people who do not feel
comfortable using traditional restrooms may choose not to attend events where they will be out
for a long time, requiring them to use a public restroom. Restroom usage is also a public
demonstration of gender, forcing those who do not identity as cisgender to succumb to a
potentially dangerous and public binary.121 In CSU’s campus newspaper, The Rocky Mountain
Collegian, Tyanna Slobe stated the campus needed to make more restrooms gender inclusive.
She pointed to Morgan Library’s Study Cube to help make her case:
We need more options when it comes to bathrooms so let’s start with the study cube.
The Study Cube has one bathroom on each floor. Each is for individual use only and has
one toilet and one sink. Other than their locations on different floors, there is nothing that
distinguishes the two—nothing, that is, except that one is labeled for women and one for
men.
In addition to being arbitrarily gendered, both of the bathrooms in the Cube are very
visible. Anyone sitting against the south wall in the building can see people entering and
leaving.122
Other student columnists picked up Slobe’s point and the issue has been revisited in the
Collegian.123 One student even created a Change.org petition to make the restrooms gender
neutral.124 These students are going through the generally recognized channels to make change
on campus.
60

Just like the assigning of bathrooms in Morgan Library can be viewed as having larger
political, social, and rhetorical implications, how other spaces are designed, created, promoted,
and filled by faculty and staff have equally important effects on library users. In particular, in
this chapter, I will discuss the spatial and material strategies of Morgan Library as an institution
to promote its vision of convergent invention. To do so, I will return to de Certeau’s notion of
strategies and how authorial forces, like library designers, encourage particular ways of using
library space. I will argue that Morgan Library is articulating its vision of convergent invention
through the use of place-making gestures evident in the themes of bodies, consumption and
leisure.
Further Defining “Convergent Invention”
In Chapters One and Two, I articulated the neologism convergent invention, which I
defined as the “cross-platform and multimodal creation of a rhetorical text which accounts for
external factors on the creator(s).” The cross-platform and multimodal part of the definition
refers to the different media used in creating a rhetorical text. The rhetorical text being created
does not have to be multimedia itself to qualify as convergent invention. For example, a student
writing an academic essay may consult journals, webpages, newspapers and videos to create
their argument. Furthermore, the phrase “rhetorical text” should be taken broadly. Because this
thesis focuses on an academic library, it is likely that the people within the library are creating
academic texts such as papers and oral presentations. “Rhetorical texts,” however, should be
taken to mean any piece of communication designed to influence an audience. The
“multimodal” part of this definition takes into account that the environment will have an effect
on the inventive process. People are unlikely to be focusing solely on the task of invention and

61

will be influenced by outside stimuli. They could be listening to music, conversing with friends,
responding to phone messages or eating a snack. Convergent invention considers these factors.
In this chapter I will argue that Morgan Library uses place-making gestures to promote its
vision of convergent invention. Understanding these gestures, however, requires an
understanding of the library’s audience: the contemporary college student and reader. If we
return to Bennett’s first two paradigms of library design (reader-centered and book-centered), a
“reader” is defined simply as someone who picks up a physical paper and book reads it.
Historically, the process has been centered on the physical book. Today, books (whether
physical or on an e-reader), are only one part of reading. The National Writing Project describes
the new type of reader as “one who reads across different media and understands reading as an
act of sharing, deconstructing, and making meaning.”125 This definition shifts what it means to
read. Websites, videos, discussion forums, social media and apps are also key elements of being
a contemporary “reader.” This is a substantial shift and symptomatic of the quickness in cultural
change in the past fifty years.126 Today’s readers are reading convergently.
The staff at Morgan Library is aware of this fact. As the library staff prepared for the
renovations they thought about how the design could incorporate spaces specifically for
convergent invention. As Dean of Libraries Patrick Burns notes regarding the design:
Elements of that design include more and better seating for studying, a 24x7 staffed study
space addition, a reconfigurable collaboratory for group learning, spaces specially
designed for multimedia development, an art lounge, internet video conference rooms
and classrooms allowing the most distinguished teachers and researchers to reach our
constituents from remote locations, more quiet study area, more advanced technology,
print on demand for books, an improved entryway, and many other features that will
enhance learning and discovery at CSU.127
While not all of these elements made it into the final product, from this quotation and the
appearance of several of the above elements in the finished product it is evident that convergent

62

invention was a major factor in the design. What is less evident, though still influential, in the
design, however, are the strategies that Morgan Library used.
Before I begin investigating strategies, I want to emphasize that I do not see strategies as
“bad” or “manipulative.” I see them instead as intentional moves to construct an environment
that the person or group making the strategy wants to create. These strategies can be beneficial
to both the creators of the strategy and the people impacted by it. One prominent example is
Black Friday shopping every year. These events can be chaotic and potentially dangerous.128
During Black Friday 2013, several big box retailers attempted to contain the crowds through
various strategies.129 These retailers were all engaging in strategies to make an effort to keep
Black Friday safer for all. I do not believe that these strategies should be viewed in a negative
light. By engaging in strategies to keep consumers somewhat organized, these retailers are
attempting to make the Black Friday experience safer for everyone. I believe that it is the ethical
responsibility of the retailers to help keep everyone as safe as possible during the event. Using
strategies to direct people and stagger traffic is a great way to work towards this goal. As I
analyze Morgan Library I am not thinking about strategies as negative or oppressive. In fact, a
person or group controlling a space can use strategies to improve a space. As I consider the
strategies present in Morgan Library, I will turn an eye to their effects on the place, the users and
the library faculty and staff.
Themes in Morgan Library
Much like the issues raised about gender-neutral restrooms in Morgan Library are a small
part of a larger societal move towards inclusivity, the everyday practices in Morgan Library are
representative of larger social trends and practices. It is important to understand convergent
invention on the level of the everyday. To better understand the vision of convergent invention

63

articulated by Morgan Library, I will investigate these strategies through the themes of bodies,
consumption and leisure.
Bodies in Spaces
It is not just students’ minds, but also their physical bodies that inhabit Morgan Library.
In the last two decades, rhetorical scholars have recognized that bodies can function as a
rhetorical statement. Carole Blair summarizes the history of bodies in rhetoric:
The body has been of tertiary concern to rhetoric traditionally, e.g., in rare considerations
of action—which seems to be the mid-late twentieth century’s version of the lost
cannon—or in an occasional examination of how bodies were used rhetorically in the
social movements of the 1960s. Bodies have become a more prominent concern in
criticism in the past few years, for various reasons. Probably the first and most
influential source of interest in bodies has been feminism, followed closely by the general
tendency toward post-Cartesian positions in this and other fields. Some versions of
poststructuralism, especially those rendered by Foucault, Lyotard, DeCerteau, and
Deleuze have called renewed attention to materialism in general and to the relationships
of discourses, political agency and bodies.130
In the history of rhetorical theory and criticism, the verbal act of speech has been privileged over
the physical body. In recent scholarship, however, materiality has also held a prominent role.
Scholars have realized that rhetorical and communicative acts can be understood by looking at
the human body. Bodies can also be examined in the context of strategies. At Morgan Library
bodies are directed by the library’s strategies. People move and act in certain ways based on the
strategies of their environment. In addition, convergent invention is spatially and physically
bound. While this form of inventional behavior may be virtual, people are required to interact
with physical objects, such as computers, keyboards and touchscreens to actually engage in
invention. The physical has not been removed from convergent invention. As such, the library
not only offers sites for convergent invention, but also deploys strategies for directing users to
them and encouraging visitors to occupy them.

64

Creating Settings for Inventional Bodies
One way in which Morgan Library promotes convergent invention throughout the
building is by creating several different settings to encourage student bodies toward convergent
invention. All of these settings for convergent invention have one common theme: access.
There are open spaces to use desktop computers, silent study areas, group study rooms and
collaborative meeting places. Users can also access different staff offices. Documents, book
stacks and various collections are located throughout the building.131 Users can take advantage
of all of these things. Access is vital across many components of convergent invention. Library
users need access to online resources, which is facilitated though the availability of computer
workstations, a reliable internet connection and outlets for people to use their own computer
devices. Access to printed materials is made possible through open stacks, an updated catalogue,
staff that reshelve books and directions to certain areas of the collection.132 More broadly, in
order to access the aforementioned resources, users need a place to sit. Without a place to
occupy while using the resources, access within the building is limited. People can access
electronic resources remotely or take their books back to another location to work. This is a
legitimate choice users should be able to make, but being forced to do so means that the library is
not providing full access because there is no access to physical space.
Providing access to usable space appears to be a design priority in Morgan Library. In
order to direct users to various areas within the building, Morgan Library enacts a variety of
different directional strategies. Colored lines, which then become part of the design of the wall,
help point people in the correct direction. A more complete building directory appears by the
various elevators. Library users are also directed by various signage in the building. The walls
feature directions to various places in the library, such as computer labs, work areas, restrooms

65

and parts of the stacks. Users can follow colored lines to their destination. In addition, other
signage directs users on how to behave in certain places. Upon entering the basement and other
silent study spaces (such as the silent study room on the third floor), users are notified by a large
sign at eye level that it is a quiet study area so they can modify their behavior accordingly.
Another sign by the first floor computer lab informs students that only covered drinks (no food)
are allowed in this area. The monitor on the first floor by the entrance to the main computer lab
also directs library users. This monitor shows which workstations are occupied (by bodies) and
which are free, helping direct traffic especially during busy times. The directions allow people
to use a space that meets their needs at the time. For example, people who would prefer a quiet
place to work individually will seek out space in the basement or one of the silent study rooms
on the third floor. If a user is new to Morgan Library, they could easily find a space to meet their
needs by looking at the signs
It is also important to note that the library provides multiple iterations and types of spaces
for encouraging convergent invention. It helps users because they have the agency to choose the
spaces in which they want to work. This gives users control over their inventive process as well
as some flexibility. For example, a person could work alone for an hour prior to a meeting, then
move to a study room to collaborate with a group. Enacting these strategies is beneficial to the
library. Giving people a variety of settings in which to invent means that more people will see
the building as useful and come to it. If the building is being used, the administration and
funding powers that be will perceive the library as a valuable campus resource and continue to
fund it appropriately. In addition, the strategy of having different areas with varying
expectations of behavior means that library staff has to do less monitoring of the space. People,
for the most part, can be expected to police themselves due to social pressures.

66

Enticing Users’ Bodies to Occupy Settings of Invention
Another way in which Morgan Library appeals to bodies is to encourage those bodies to
occupy these settings for convergent invention once they have located them. As discussed
above, an important part of libraries providing access (and thus, an environment for convergent
invention) is providing a place for users to sit and work. The library environment needs to be
comfortable for users. This invitation to bodies in done through three kinds of material appeals
through furnishings: comfortable, flexible, and communal (i.e. collaborative) furniture.
One noteworthy aspect of furniture in Morgan Library is how comfortable it is. Instead of
only rows of stationary study carrels and tables lining the halls, Morgan Library also features
comfortable chairs, small portable tables, and ottomans. The casual furniture provides a place for
people to sit and work (or relax) in a more comfortable position. These furnishings also signal to
the users that they are in a more casual and comfortable environment. For example, the sole
purpose of an ottoman is putting one’s feet up. By accepting a material invitation to put one’s
feet up, the user is engaging in the relaxed behavior invited by certain areas of the space. More
“serious” seeming spaces are available (such as the study carrels and tables) but these spaces are
not the only option for library users.
In addition, the mobility of the furniture allows people to move it to where they need to
go with very little trouble. As such, these spaces are flexible to users’ inventional needs. From
the perspective of the library, this limited mobility allows people to move the furniture without
moving it too far. Users have agency, but not too much agency in that they can rearrange the
entire library. The library strategically responds to the tactical movement of furniture. In Figure
3.1 it is obvious that users have moved various chairs around a singular table. Later, after the
semester, the library decided to put the tables and chairs back where they officially “belong.”

67

Figure 3.2 shows the reconfigured space. The table in Figure 3.1 was where the two ottomans
are located in Figure 3.2. Tactics have met strategies and order has been restored to the furniture
in Morgan Library.
Lastly, the library entices users into these spaces of convergent invention by making them
ideal for connected and collaborative inventional work. Since convergent invention often
requires user to access and synthesize the texts and ideas of others with their own, spaces of
convergent invention by necessity must invite multiple bodies to occupy one single inventional
space. An excellent example of this material rhetoric is the third floor Collaboratory. The
Collaboratory features flexible seating designed to be reconfigured based on the needs of the
current users. Users can move the couches closer together, move a portable whiteboard into their
working area or sit around a table so group members have a place to put their food, drink, phones
and/or laptops. Because it is in an open environment (unlike a private study room) the place
invites collaboration between other users who were not in the original group of people working
there.
Taken together, the most immediate ways in which Morgan Library encourages users to
practice convergent invention is by building spaces for this purpose, directing users to them, and
enticing them to occupy those spaces when they arrive. One of the important ways in which this
happens is through providing places that appeal to the physical body. The body is vital to
inventive behavior because without a physical presence it is impossible to engage ideas. As we
will see, however, the library also promotes convergent invention in other important ways.
Multiple Forms of Consumption
In addition to encouraging bodies to occupy and use spaces of convergent invention,
Morgan Library further promotes particular kinds of convergent invention through providing

68

spaces of consumption in some traditional and nontraditional ways. In some ways, libraries have
been designed as places of consumption since their inception. Eyes read pages and consume their
ideas, hands flip through books, stacks display and arrange books for bodies to encounter and
consume. The library purchases, retains, and preserves books and materials intended for user
consumption. Books, maps and other resources are to be used rather than admired from a
distance.133 Library users are encouraged to continue their consumption of library resources
outside of the physical premises though the offering of remote access to databases and other
resources. Within reasonable policy parameters libraries call out to be used, encouraging people
to visit and utilize the available resources. Even in a library, where resources and knowledge are
provided for free, consumer behavior still occurs. This is not necessarily just a gift granted by
the institution, but can also be self-serving to libraries. Ann Thorp argues that designers have an
incentive to design consumerist spaces, because in a society that consumes less, designers will be
out of a job.134 Libraries are no different. Consistent usage of the library indicates that its
intended audience (public or academic) finds it useful in some way, hopefully leading to
increased or sustained funding.
While libraries have always been a place of consumption, contemporary library spaces
like those in Morgan Library now foster new, less traditional forms of consumption that promote
this space in particular as a site of convergent invention. In many ways, this is a response to the
digitization of information traditionally housed and only accessible in the library. However, as
library collections increasingly go online and places like coffee shops entice customers to access
these collections within these commercial spaces, libraries have sought out ways to make the
library once again the space in which convergent invention should happen. This has required
libraries to offer different objects to be consumed by users. In Morgan Library, the new library

69

user consumes more than just texts; they consume technology to access inventional materials,
food to promote ongoing social and embodied forms of invention, and even spaces (such as
private study rooms) in which to engage in collaborative and/or convergent invention.
Technology Consumption
Technology is inherently bound both to materiality and convergent invention. Without
technology it is impossible to consume a broad variety of media. The technology offered in
Morgan Library provides students with new ways to access this media. In addition to desktop
computers, Morgan Library provides laptop computers and iPads for checkout. Users can check
out an HP, Mac or Chromebook laptop for up to six hours to use in the library or the Behavioral
Sciences Building. iPads can be checked out for a week and can be connected to wireless
networks both on and off campus. Recently (in April 2014) Morgan Library introduced Wacom
drawing tablets for users to check out for up to three days. All of these technologies have an
important component of materiality. The various computer options have different form factors.
With these different form factors come a variety of ways in which a person may choose to use
the technology. A person may choose to use one of the desktop computers so they can utilize a
larger screen space for viewing multiple documents. That same person may choose to use a
laptop (their own or the library’s) for working on a shorter assignment or responding to email in
a more casual place, such as a comfortable chair. An iPad might be utilized for collaborating
with a group on an assignment because it does not block a person’s view of others at the table.
These choices can affect the inventive process. If a person is struggling to use new technology
or experiencing “technical difficulties” while inventing some of their thought process will be
taken off of the intellectual work at hand and focused on making the technology work.

70

By providing these kinds of technology, Morgan Library is also directing the ways in
which people consume it. This is strategic on behalf of the library. One way to think about this
strategy is instead of considering what technology is present considering what is not. Morgan
Library has chosen to provide iPads instead of Android tablets. They have chosen not to make
Linux based laptops or desktops available to their students.135 By providing some types of
consumer technology and not others, Morgan Library is shaping how its users consume
technology. Morgan Library is directing people to consume one product instead of another.
This choice is inevitable: it is unrealistic to expect Morgan, or any library, to provide access to
every new technological gadget available. It is simply not practical or affordable for them to do
so. That being said, the types of technology Morgan Library chooses to provide do direct
consumption.
This, however, is my critical perspective. The ways in which Morgan Library is
strategically communicating about technology usage may send a different message to students.
As a critic and technology enthusiast, I am looking at what is not present in the library. Students,
however, are likely to consider what is present and to see a variety of technological options. One
reason is because it is different than what they already own. If a student owns a Windows-based
computer, using a Mac is a different experience. If a student does not own a tablet, using that
form factor is a new experience, leading them to perceive it as a new and novel. In addition, the
library’s own signage leads to this perception. Signs at the front desk encourage excitement
about new technology, encouraging students to “check out” the library’s new gadgets. The
phrase “check out” works on two different levels. The first meaning is colloquial. It beckons
students to look at and try the new technology. The second meaning is more library related.

71

Students literally “checkout” the materials using their CSU ID cards. Both meanings come
together to encourage students to be excited about and use the new technology.
This shaping is not limited to the walls of Morgan Library or even the campus at CSU.
Providing technological access to people gives them the opportunity to try new technology
without having to invest in it for themselves. Trialability is an important component of how
people adopt new technological innovations. Innovation theorist Everett Rogers defines
trialability as “the degree to which an innovation may be experimented with on a limited
basis.”136 If a person is considering adopting a new technological innovation, they are more
likely to adopt something they can try before they buy. The ability to try an innovation makes
people feel more secure in investing their time, money and data in it.
Morgan Library’s vision of convergent invention indicates that the library is not just a
place to collaborate with others but to try new ways of doing so. By providing various kinds of
technology, Morgan Library is providing its users with free trialability of new products. This
trialability directly affects what people choose to consume, even when outside of the library. For
example, when Morgan Library recently added Chromebooks to their laptop selection I was
curious about how they worked. Having only seen advertisements for them and never used one
in person, I decided to check one out. After using it to grade student work and respond to email
(while listening to music on Pandora), I decided that while the Chromebook was interesting, it
was not a technology that would work for my inventional needs.137 Through trying the
Chromebook in Morgan Library I gained an insight into the ways others may use it to engage in
convergent invention.

72

Food Consumption
Morgan Library is also a site of food consumption. Coffee shops, like Morgan’s Grind,
are relatively new in libraries. For the majority of the history of libraries, food and drink has
been outright banned or at the very least, highly restricted. Now Morgan Library is not just
allowing people to eat and drink inside, but selling their users food and beverage, thus condoning
its consumption. This act furthers the rhetoric of Morgan Library as a site of convergent
invention. This happens in four ways: as an attention getting technique, by making libraries a
place of sustenance, by drawing on the history of coffee shops, and by competing with similar
spaces off campus.
First, the availability of food consumption directs people to Morgan Library. 138 If a
person is hungry and/or desires a caffeinated pick-me-up, they will go to a place that has those
options for sale. Morgan’s Grind is a convenient location for a lot of people on campus. It is
centrally located on a high traffic area (the Plaza), meaning that it is not very far away from
important spaces such as classrooms, offices and labs. With the closure of the Lory Student
Center, this space has become more important for such traffic. When people come to Morgan
Library to get their coffee or snack they are greeted by the large entryway. If they look up, they
can see the second and third floors on display with users working (or appearing to work) on
inventional activity. In addition, users who come to Morgan Library for other purposes may
walk in and smell the coffee coming from Morgan’s Grind and be encouraged to stop by and get
a cup. Morgan Library draws people in with caffeine and then materially reminds them of the
multitude of resources available within.
Second, by offering foods and coffee for users, the library also can keep people in the
building and engaged. If a person is hungry they will have difficulty focusing on the task at

73

hand: convergent invention. A hungry student is likely choose to leave the library and find
somewhere to eat instead of staying in the building. Morgan Library realized that food and drink
consumption, however, come at a cost. Coffee cups and food wrappers create a large amount of
waste for the library’s custodial staff. To remedy the problem, the library has strategically
placed many trash and recycling receptacles throughout the building. These are large bins, as
evidenced in Figure 3.3. The bins draw users’ attention and provide them with a place to throw
their trash.
Third, Morgan Library directs users to purchase a very specific type of food and beverage
that has a long history of enticing rhetorical forms of invention: coffee and coffee shop fare.
Students have a variety of dining options on campus, including other coffee shops, dining halls, a
convenience store, and even a bar. By providing a coffee shop, Morgan Library draws users to
consume a certain kind of food and drink. In his book, The Structural Transformation of the
Public Sphere: An Inquiry into Bourgeois Society, Jürgen Habermas discusses how coffee houses
in Europe were the sites of public sphere discourse.
The bourgeois public sphere may be conceived above all as the sphere of private people
come together as a public; they soon claimed the public sphere regulated from above
against the public authorities themselves, to engage them in a debate over the general
rules governing relations in the basically privatized but publicly relevant sphere of
commodity exchange and social labor.139
The public sphere was a place for members of the bourgeois society to get together and discuss
issues of the day, serving to moderate discourse between the state and the general public.140
Even if users are unaware of this specific history, the cultural awareness of coffee shops as a
place of discourse is still largely in place. Going out for coffee is still a ritual in the business and
academic worlds. Coffee shops create a natural place to take a break and have a more casual

74

conversation. The act of drinking allows for natural pauses in discussion where people can stop
and think about their next comment.
Fourth and finally, the relaxed material feel of a consumer-based (i.e. consumptive)
coffee shop encourages visitors to participate in the social and affective dimensions of invention
that are promoted outside of libraries while still within the library space. Traditionally, libraries
have discouraged the type of behavior common in coffee shops: food and drink consumption,
socialization, and meeting in groups. Morgan Library, however encourages all of these
activities. There are quite a few coffee shops within one block of campus which cater to
students. These businesses are in competition with Morgan Library for student traffic. If
students, however, can get the same experience on campus, there is no reason for them to go
elsewhere. Students in Morgan Library can act as if they are in a consumer zone without
stepping off campus.
Libraries have always been sites of consumption in that library users consume books and
other materials within. Morgan Library, and other contemporary libraries, are changing this
perception. Consumption within Morgan Library is not only related to books, magazines,
newspapers and academic journals, but technology and food. Both of these types of
consumption contribute to the overall environment in Morgan Library as one of convergent
invention.
Integration of Leisure
Finally, material elements of Morgan Library encourage users to see the space as a site of
leisure and play, two elements which foster convergent forms of invention. Thorsen Veblen, an
economic theorist of leisure from the late 19th century, argued that the leisure class was defined
by their separation from industrial processes, such as working in a factory. Today, I would argue

75

that a similar conception of the leisure class exists, defined by separation from not just industrial
labor, but working in jobs such as fast food, cleaning, and manual labor. Veblen explains the
socioeconomic distinction between the leisure and non-leisure class, noting:
From the days of the Greek philosophers to the present, a degree of leisure and of
exemption from contact with such industrial processes as serve the immediate everyday
purposes of human life has ever been recognised by thoughtful men [sic] as a prerequisite
to a worthy or beautiful, or even a blameless, human life. In itself and in its consequences
the life of leisure is beautiful and ennobling in all civilised men's [sic] eyes.141
Some of the defining characteristics of the leisure class are that they have the time, energy and
resources to engage in educational and intellectual activities. Working long, laborious hours and
having minimal education does not engender an environment in which one has the time to
contemplate ideas. The contemplation of ideas is essential to convergent invention. Under
Veblen’s conception, then, students are definitely leisure class, devoting a large portion of their
time to educational and intellectual activities. While it does not seem like it to the students,
being able to complete a long paper is a sign of their place in the leisure class. In this way, the
library facilitates a retaining of the leisure class identity of its users, even if such an identity may
be under threat. Morgan Library is designed to facilitate an appropriate balance between work
and play during a user’s experience.
Play may seem unimportant or not valuable to academic activity, but it is an important
cornerstone to how people learn and create new ideas. Creativity and play have become more
important in the past decade or two. Richard Florida, a scholar on creativity, the workplace and
social class, argues for the rise of a “creative class:” a class of people who work in creative
professions of many kinds, coming up with new ideas. The creative class is generally made of
college-educated students: the exact target of Morgan Library. In his book, Rise of the Creative

76

Class: And How it’s Transforming Work, Leisure, Community and Everyday Life, Florida makes
a connection between play, creativity, and learning. He notes:
Creativity involves the ability to synthesize. Albert Einstein captured this nicely when he
characterized his own work as ‘combinatory play.’ It is a matter of sifting through data,
perceptions, and materials to come up with combinations that are new and useful. A
creative synthesis might result in such different outcomes as a practical invention, a
theory or insight that can be applied to solve a problem or a work of art that can be
appreciated aesthetically.142
Being an effective member of the creative class requires the ability to synthesize information to
create a new idea. This is the task of convergent invention as imagined in this thesis. In order to
facilitate preparation for and membership in the creative class, Morgan Library needs to
acknowledge that real academic work is likely to include some leisure-related or playful
elements and to provide spaces for those elements within the walls of the building. Two
strategies appear in the space that makes this possible: liberal usage policies and the
acknowledgement of other leisure activities.
Liberal Usage Policies
One of the ways in which Morgan Library facilitates leisure is through liberal usage
policies. These policies directly link to the material resources available to library users. Library
users are free to visit whatever websites, within reason, that they choose. K-12 school libraries
block access to social networking sites like Facebook and Reddit and may block access to
YouTube and Pandora internet radio. Morgan Library, conversely, does not block any sites.
Students can access social networks, watch Netflix and listen to music.143 In theory, a person
could occupy a seat and do nothing but visit social networks all day.
This is an important policy to discuss because some sites that are seen as “entertainment”
can serve other academic purposes. This rings especially true in my work as a communication
scholar. Two semesters ago I wrote a rhetorical criticism of a speech in a film. I used two
77

laptops to work on the paper in Morgan Library: one to watch the film on my Netflix account
and one to write the paper. If the library had decided that Netflix served no educational purpose
and blocked access I would not have been able to complete my paper.
In addition, in a convergence culture, a piece of technology does not have one exclusive
purpose. For example, a student could be listening to music and talking to a friend on Facebook
while working on their paper. The student may also be using Facebook to talk to their friend
about the assignment or course. By not blocking these sites the library facilitates such blurred
usages. For example I have done some of my own work, such as writing or grading, while
talking to a friend in another graduate program on Facebook. These conversations can move
from leisure topics (“I’m looking forward to seeing you at NCA!”) to academic work (“I’m
working on a paper about spatiality and invention.”) and back again. Morgan Library facilitates
such usages. The chairs and workstations are organized so that people have some privacy over
their work. The computer monitors could be arranged to allow people, such as library staff or
other users, to examine what a person is doing. Technology use is rather open as well. Library
staff exercises minimal controls over what a person does with the technology they borrow. A
user could borrow an iPad and take it across the country to a conference. They could use the
iPad to watch a movie on the flight there, navigate while at the conference and use it to keep up
with email and social networks in their down time. Provided that they do not lose or damage it
(in which case a fee is assessed), this is a perfectly acceptable usage.
Strategically, these liberal usage policies can make monitoring the space a lot easier. If
Facebook or other social network/entertainment sites were blocked, library staff would have to
answer a lot of requests about how to get these sites unblocked for legitimate academic usage.
Any filter put up by the library would also likely be a target of technologically savvy students.

78

In addition, these liberal usage policies make Morgan Library a place where students want to go.
If students felt highly restricted they may avoid the place all together.
Acknowledgement of Other Leisure
The second way the library appeals to convergent invention through leisure is by
acknowledging other kinds of leisure in the space. Morgan Library acknowledges outdoor
leisure by providing clear views of the natural world. From the lower level on the west side,
students can see the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and the Campus Rec center, both of which
are sites of leisure. Figure 3.4 shows this view from the first floor of Morgan Library. These
sites are especially visible as users climb the main stairs on the north side of the building. To see
the top floors students can only go one direction: West. When walking up the stairs on the north
side of the building users are literally walking towards the mountains, suggesting a framing of
the outdoors. Areas with windows surrounding the courtyard also provide a glimpse of the
outdoors. Visitors can see a birdbath, statue, and benches in the courtyard, indicating a park-like
space of outdoor socialization. The mountains are visible from the entire west side of the library.
Such a framing is vital because leisure in Colorado is generally associated with the outdoors,
including biking, running, hiking and, of course, skiing and snowboarding. Coloradans associate
the outdoors with recreation.144 These visual cues remind the visitor that the “great outdoors” is
still there and still waiting for them when they are done studying. Seeing the Rec Center is a
reminder that recreation and athletic activity are still there when students get the chance to visit.
These more specific reminders to visitors echo the overall message of the importance of
(outdoor) leisure in Colorado. This strategy also references larger themes at CSU. The
University prides itself on being a “green” campus and seeing the outdoors prominently featured
in the library’s design provides a gentle reminder of that mission.

79

This acknowledgement of other leisure allows library users to retain some connection to
the outdoors while engaging in convergent invention. If Morgan Library were completely
disconnected from the world of outside leisure, potential users may feel completely disconnected
from the outside world. They may spend their time thinking that they would rather be doing
other outdoor activities instead of doing their homework and thus, leave the space to engage in
other activities. References to the outdoors, such as the large windows leading to the mountains,
the courtyard and the brickwork inside help make students feel less disconnected. Users can see
elements of the outdoors from many areas of the library and may seek out places with more
outdoor exposure. For example, the Living Room on the third floor near the Collaboratory has a
wide range of west facing windows with great views of the mountains. This room is filled with
natural light coming through large windows and designed with red and brown colors, leading
users to feel more in tune with nature. These elements contribute to an atmosphere of creativity,
fun and leisure, which is helpful for the work of the creative class, and thus, convergent
invention.
One of the key parts of convergent invention is the idea that invention is not simply
sitting down, creating a text and then leaving. Convergent invention is bound to the environment
in which it occurs. In its design, Morgan Library realizes that it is a space not just for pure work,
but for a variety of intellectual activities as well. By providing spaces that allow users to engage
in activities that are not directly work-related as well as providing gestures to the outdoors,
Morgan Library fits into the users’ already existing needs.
Conclusion
Spaces manifest power; therefore it is to the benefit of a space or place to exercise some
strategies over users. Just like retail establishments need to control crowds on Black Friday,

80

Morgan Library needs to engage in strategies to create a manageable and productive experience
for users. These strategies, as discussed in this chapter, are designed to articulate Morgan
Library’s vision of convergent invention. There are two implications to Morgan Library’s
strategies: first, they are useful applications of authority and second, the strategies anticipate and
incorporate the tactics of the users.
First, in the current state of affairs, it appears that the strategies enacted by Morgan
Library are useful deployments of the library’s authority over the place. There is a place for
almost every kind of invention within the walls of the library. From casual observations of users,
they seem to follow along fairly well.145 By encouraging convergent invention, users are
encouraged to do something that is beneficial to them. The space invites users to come in and
stay for a while rather than making the library seem like a place of doom and gloom. This
changes the ways in which people perceive not only the library, but their educational experience
as a whole. For students who are regular users of Morgan Library in any way, the space has the
potential to encourage lifelong intellectual curiosity.
By definition, lifelong learning takes place outside of the collegiate environment.
Morgan Library’s strategies contribute to the intellectual and educational mission of the
university in another important way. The contemporary workspace is starting to look more like
Morgan Library. Students’ experiences using the library as an undergraduate socialize them in
some of the working practices of the contemporary workplace. Startup culture is particularly
similar to the design of Morgan Library. As an article on tech news website Mashable notes,
“Most startups have certain crucial design elements in common. These include employee lounge
areas with cozy seating and colorful accents, snack-filled kitchens where employees can chat as
they refuel and TV monitors used for everything from video-conferencing to gaming.”146 Many

81

of these elements can be found in Morgan Library. For students who will not be working in
startups, more offices are moving towards an open-concept design where people are housed in a
larger room instead of individual offices. Open-concept offices are made of large workspaces
with smaller conference rooms or gathering areas and employees used to a more traditional
workplace must adapt, which can be a challenge.147 While doing schoolwork in Morgan Library
is not a resume line for students, the experience can help them make a smoother transition to the
professional workforce.
Part of the effectiveness of Morgan Library’s strategies is that they anticipate the tactics
of users and address them in their strategies. By making furniture with limited mobility, users
have the opportunity to move furniture to suit their needs, but within predetermined limits. A
food-friendly policy makes it difficult for users to violate the policy—if food and drink are
permitted it is difficult to break the rules. The monitor on the first floor directing users towards
open desktop workstations strongly suggests to users where they should put their bodies. Users,
however, welcome the direction because they are looking for a place to work and being directed
towards an open station saves them time and frustration.
If the space is generally meeting the needs of its users it goes mostly uncontested. With
no reason to engage a tactic to make the space more livable users take very little, if any, direct
action. On the surface, a lack of action seems perfectly fine. Without a reason for taking action,
why should users bother? As someone with a penchant for order and organization, I would
prefer stability to chaos. I like being able to go to a silent study area and know that I will find
peace and quiet and I would be quite annoyed at people engaging in tactics to disrupt my quiet.
Strategies are helpful to control user behavior, but the complete absence of tactics in response
means that the entity engaging the strategies has an abundance of power. Key to de Certeau’s

82

theories is the contestation of the idea that users are passive. In de Certeau’s perception, users do
not just passively move through space; they actively construct it through their actions. If users at
Morgan Library are not using any tactics to move through space, they are not being active users
and leaving the space uncontested.
This is problematic for the same reasons that any other lack of active questioning is
problematic: it leaves one person, group or entity dictating the actions of the other. Even though
the tactics engaged by users inform the current strategies of Morgan Library, there is no
indication that the needs of both the library and its users will remain the same. If users become
complacent, however, then they will not be able to tactically communicate the need for change to
the library. They will use apathetically or take their convergent invention elsewhere. Neither
option is productive. From this rhetorical analysis I believe there is currently a fair balance of
power in Morgan Library, but this balance can always change.
This is not to say that tactics have been rendered unnecessary in Morgan Library. It is
important moving forward however, to consider that Morgan Library has made an effort to meet
the tactical needs of users. Tactics are still important in Morgan Library as the space is not
meeting all of its users’ needs. For example, as of this writing in April of 2014, the restrooms in
the Study Cube at Morgan Library are still gendered. While Morgan Library makes an effort to
provide a space that meets their vision of convergent invention, this space does not always reflect
the needs, wants or desires of the library using population at CSU. Users are speaking out
against this practice.
In this chapter, I examined how Morgan Library spatially articulates its vision of
convergent invention by exploring three rhetorical themes in the library: bodies, consumption
and leisure. Chapter Four will pick up with the same themes analyzed differently. Instead of

83

looking at Morgan Library rhetorically, Chapter Four will use empirical methods to observe
convergent invention at work. I will examine how the space is used tactically to engage (or not
engage) in inventive behavior.

CHAPTER FOUR: TACTICS FOR EMBRACIING OR REJECTING CONVERGENT
INVENTION
One afternoon I walked into Morgan Library with the intention of doing a behavior
observation. After I set down my things, a student approached me. She asked if I was the GTA
(graduate teaching assistant) for her Rhetoric in Western Thought class. I said that I was.148 The
student had some time off because her class had been cancelled and she wanted to do the reading
but her book was at home and a copy of the text, which was supposed to be on reserve, was not
yet ready. After this discovery, she asked me for some help understanding the readings. Given
the primary source texts we assigned, I could empathize with her struggle. We had a casual
conversation about reading classical theory and I gave suggestions that worked for me when I
was reading primary texts for the first time. About twenty minutes later she went on her way and
I sat down near where I had started to observe behavior.
As I began by observation, however, I was preoccupied with the behavior in which I had
just participated.149 I wondered why this student had chosen to approach me in the library.
Morgan Library does not provide an official place or time for office hours; I have an office with
posted times I will be available to meet with students. While I am knowledgeable about
libraries, I am not part of the library staff and am likely not the best person to answer questions
about why a book was not yet available. I wondered what made her feel comfortable enough to
approach me. Was it something about me personally that made her feel comfortable to approach
and ask for help? Or the atmosphere the professor set on the first day of class and the way he
introduced the GTAs? Was it the atmosphere of the library, a place designed to encourage
collaboration?

87

In my view, this rhetorical theory student acted in line with the tactical possibilities of the
library space. Opportune moments are key to de Certeau’s definition of tactics. This student
acted in the moment. She saw me sit down and quickly jumped on the opportunity to ask her
question. This rhetorical theory student capitalized on an important but not so obvious resource
within Morgan Library: the other users. Her tactical act demonstrated a new way of considering
space and resources within the library.150 While I may have been initially annoyed by her
interruption, the act revealed a new way of thinking about spatiality in Morgan Library.
The collaborative atmosphere of the library strategically promoted her act.
By the time I had finished helping her and returned to do my observations I felt
differently about the encounter. It was fun for me to discuss reading the texts with her because I
am passionate about rhetorical theory. As we talked, I felt like we were engaging in the struggle
to understand Plato and Aristotle together. While we were not creating our own text, we were
collaborating on understanding a class concept. The conversation was meaningful academic
work. As a GTA, I love working with students on understanding concepts from class. In order
to have these conversations, however, students usually have to come to office hours or make an
appointment. This conversation was more natural and spontaneous than a planned office hours
visit. At the end of the conversation I appreciated her tactic and had an enjoyable time thinking
about rhetoric. The conversation also helped me by giving me some interesting behavior to
observe. It was a win-win situation for both of us.
In Chapter Three I discussed how Morgan Library uses emplaced strategies to direct
behavior. In this chapter I return to the rhetorical themes of Chapter Three (bodies, consumption
and leisure), but with a new purpose. Through the use of two empirical research methodologies
(survey data and behavior observation) I investigate how the audience responds to these rhetorics

88

in expected and unexpected ways. In other words, through these two methodologies, I will show
the tactical rhetorics that library users utilize to respond to Morgan Library’s rhetorical
messages and its vision of convergent invention. By doing so, I illustrate actually-existing ways
in which students use Morgan Library, how that confirms or disrupts the library’s material
suggestions, and what that means for understanding libraries as material rhetoric. I will begin by
discussing the empirical methods (survey and behavior observation) in more detail. I will then
return to the rhetorical themes of Chapter Three (bodies, consumption and leisure) to discuss
how these themes appear in the empirical research. I will also include a short section detailing
forms of student’s tactical rhetorics that exist outside of these strategic directives. The conclusion
of this chapter will provide some preliminary conclusions about Morgan Library as a text as well
as some thoughts on the effectiveness of the mixed methodology.
Rhetorical Themes Expressed Empirically
In this section I will return to the rhetorical themes I discussed in Chapter Three and
discuss how they do or do not manifest in the empirical data. I am using this organizational
pattern for a few reasons. First, it provides the reader with an easy way to follow the arguments.
Second, methodologically, this organization allows for greater blending of the rhetorical and
empirical data. As I discussed in Chapter Two, an important goal of this thesis is not only to
understand the communication in Morgan Library but to evaluate how a mixed methodology
approach can explain a space or place as a rhetorical text. I am hoping to see how users
tactically respond to the strategies of Morgan Library. The most effective way to do so is to
continue examining the same areas of analysis.

89

Bodies
In Chapter Three I discussed the ways in which bodies are important to the material
rhetoric of Morgan Library. Bodies are inherent in convergent invention: we need our eyes to
see a screen, our ears to hear audio and our fingers to type words.151 Morgan Library uses
strategies to direct the bodies within to certain types of convergent invention. Bodies are
directed towards certain locations, such as open computer workstations, silent study areas or
group study rooms. In addition, bodies are provided with a variety of settings for existence.
Furniture, an essential part of moving one’s body, contributes to the material rhetoric of Morgan
Library by communicating about the places available for convergent invention.
Space Between Bodies
While collaboration was an important part of the rhetorical study, personal space proved
vital during the behavior observations. Students tended to leave space between themselves and
others, especially in quiet study areas. In the basement study carrels users would leave at least
one carrel of space between themselves and others. In addition, users tended to not sit down
with people they did not know. In the basement quiet study area it was obvious that those sitting
at a table knew the other person(s) they were with by their low whispering or interacting in a way
nonverbally that indicated they were familiar with each other. In the more social areas, such as
the second and third floor, people would greet their friends as they sat down and joined them.
Groups also tended to leave space between themselves and others. These behaviors showed that
students kept a socially appropriate distance between themselves and others and desired more
space in silent, solo studying areas.
In Chapter Three I focused on how users could be directed towards areas of the library
and how they could be directed towards collaboration with each other. Observing the behaviors

90

in the silent study areas provides an additional layer of nuance to this observation. Personal
space was an important desire as well. In the context of a student’s life, this makes a fair amount
of sense. Students who live in the residence halls are forced to share close quarters with another
person with whom they may or may not get along. Other students may live in small apartments
or houses and not get a lot of personal space. Going to the library and sitting in a silent area
away from others may not make them completely alone but it is a plausible way to get personal
time. This observation does not negate the importance of strategies for collaboration in Morgan
Library, but it does show that students are tactically using the space to avoid interaction with
others.
Directed Bodies
The direction of bodies and foot traffic is important to the smooth functioning of a space.
During behavior observations, library users appeared to mostly follow the traffic directives of the
space. While entering the main library by the circulation desk users walked on the right side of
the hallway. This kept the traffic flowing in and out of the building. When people ran into
someone they knew, they generally pulled to the side to have a conversation so others could
easily walk around them. Users stayed quiet in the quiet study areas. When this rule was
violated the users violating it were given dirty looks by the others in the space. This frequently
led to a change in behavior. Users rarely had to verbally confront each other to keep the volume
down in the space.
These observations indicate that the strategies used by Morgan Library are generally
effective in creating a self-policing and self-directing place. Part of this success may stem from
users’ earlier socialization in spatial usage practices. In the United States we are socialized to
travel on the right side of a roadway, sidewalk or hallway. It would make sense then that

91

students usually walk on the right side of entrances and exits at Morgan Library. In addition,
users have already been socialized in general library usage practices. By the time people arrive
at college, they have already used a library and thus have learned accepted practices within.
Stereotypes of librarians and libraries still exist and these factors may affect how users act and
react within the space. More narrowly, Morgan Library’s individual strategies are helpful in
enacting a place in which people work on their academic tasks. Users are lead through the space
in ways that make sense. Signage points people towards proper behavior. For example, the quiet
study areas are well-marked so that it is obvious upon entry what types of behavior are expected.
In addition, the directional tools on the walls were occasionally employed to find various parts of
the library. This was a difficult behavior to observe because not all users were looking for a
specific area, but just for a place to sit. I observed a few users go from OPACs to looking at the
walls to figure out the floor on which their book was located.
One directional strategy was a bit of an exception to these conclusions. While most users
followed the directives of the space, one directive tool that was underutilized compared to my
emphasis on it in the rhetorical criticism was the computer station map. Some users glanced at
the computer station map but many just entered the computer lab and wandered around looking
for a station, especially during busier times. After more formal observation, it seems that this
tool was not as useful as it could have been. Sometimes it was flat-out incorrect, showing spaces
as available that were not. Other times it was inaccurate because a user would be sitting at a
workstation without being logged in to the computer. A station may also be difficult to use or
unavailable because a person had taken the chair from it, perhaps to work with a partner two to a
station. The user would have to find a chair for the computer, which may be a socially awkward

92

situation. In addition, users may forget exactly what station they were looking for especially as
they got further from the map.
Going forward, the map is an excellent idea, but perhaps there are some additional
strategies that would make it more useful. Morgan Library could use signage to remind users not
to occupy a station unless they are using the computer there and to ask users not to move chairs
away from other stations. Multiple maps around the computer lab may also be helpful in
directing traffic once users are not close to the map by the stairs. Finally, for any of these
changes to work, the map(s) must be accurate. Users will ignore a finding device that does not
do its job.
Furniture Usage
As noted in the rhetorical criticism, the movement and usage of furniture was key to
using the space in Morgan Library. During observations, furniture was moved to get individuals
closer to their collaborators or further away from others. In addition, users employed chairs in
nontraditional ways. Some users put their feet on chairs across from them. People sitting at
tables without anyone across from them frequently stretched their feet out on to the chair across
the table. Users sitting in larger, more comfortable stand-alone chairs sometimes put their feet
up on smaller desk chairs when ottomans were unavailable or inconvenient. Others used chairs
to store their backpacks or other bags, keeping them off the floor and allowing for easier access.
These actions indicated that furniture is important to users. In addition, furniture usage
belies several other desires and characteristics of library users. Users want to sit in a physically
comfortable position. By putting their feet on other chairs, users are attempting to make
themselves feel more comfortable in the space. Comfort in general is important to students in
Morgan Library. In addition, these usages of furniture indicate that users view Morgan Library

93

as a casual place. If users perceived Morgan Library to be a formal environment they would not
be sitting with a casual posture and putting their feet up on chairs. Users feel comfortable and
relaxed in Morgan Library. For users, this can mean a more comfortable environment in which
to accomplish their tasks. Stressed out users are likely to be less productive users. Without
burdensome expectations of formality, users may relax and create instead of spending excessive
time worrying about propriety.
Strategically, Morgan Library communicates to users that it is a space of casual yet
productive convergent invention. Overall, the users of Morgan Library embraced this message
but in ways that were not wholly expected by the initial reading. The initial reading found that
Morgan Library encouraged collaboration, but users tactically responded by avoiding others as
much as possible. It is hard to collaborate, especially to engage in random, unplanned
collaborations, when a person is trying to avoid talking to others. Morgan Library’s users took
the place’s message of comfort and extended it. Chairs were not designed or intended for feet or
backpacks; they were intended for sitting. By tactically repurposing the available resources in
this way, Morgan Library’s users indicated that not only did they get the message, but they were
willing to make that message and usage go as far as possible.
Consumption
In Chapter Three, I discussed Morgan Library as a place of consumption. While library
users have always consumed books and other materials, the nature of that consumption has
changed throughout library history. I focused on two types of consumption in Morgan Library:
technology and food/drink. I argued that Morgan Library’s technological offerings directed
students’ consumption of technology in-house and also had the power to direct technology
consumption after leaving the library. Food and drink were key aspects of Morgan Library,

94

drawing in users who were hungry and/or desired a beverage. Both of these elements materially
linked Morgan Library to consumptive activity.
Laptops
During the rhetorical portion of the thesis I placed an emphasis on the implications of
Morgan Library’s laptop checkout service. The students themselves made significantly less
usage of this service than I thought. The overwhelming majority of respondents (158, 73%) said
they never use the service. In comparison, students were more likely to prefer the first floor
desktop computers instead of using a laptop. Only 60 (28%) respondents “never” use the first
floor desktop computers while 113 (51.8%) use these computers at least once per month. These
results could be explained by the relative availability of each. According to the library’s catalog,
about 136 MacBooks are available while the library states that the first floor computer lab has
“over 200 PC stations.”152 A desktop is more likely to be available to a user than a laptop and is
easier to acquire (no waiting and checking out materials), so users may prefer the easier option.
In addition, I did not survey users on their behavior regarding checking out tablets.153 This was a
research error on my part and the data gathered would have added to my analysis.
The data indicates that a low percentage of people are checking out laptops at Morgan
Library. This data prompts a reconsideration of my arguments about laptops and other portable
technology in Chapter 3. I argued, using the widely accepted theoretical basis of Everett Rogers’
Diffusion of Innovations theory, that libraries were essential places for the trialability of new
technological innovations. This data does not indicate that such an argument is completely
invalid, but it does prompt reassessment of both the rhetorical analysis and the survey data. On
the rhetorical end, the argument could be based too heavily on my own personal experiences. I
have personally used libraries to trial new technology: I checked out an e-reader from a public

95

library before choosing to purchase one for myself. In addition, I am very interested in trying
out new technology for myself. The moment one of my friends gets a new shiny electronic toy
they know I am going to be begging to take a look. In addition as an advanced library user I like
to try the new services of any library I visit, including Morgan. Perhaps my criticism was too
based on my own personal experiences. Another consideration could come from the data. The
survey sample size was heavily skewed towards first and second year students. Because many
students buy new technology before coming to college, they are not in the market for a new
product and have no reason to consider the innovation. These students, being new to CSU, may
also be unaware of the service or feel uncomfortable using it.
This utilization data provides a clue that my interpretation of part of the library’s
consumption strategy is not similarly interpreted by parts of the user population. I believe that
there are a few explanations for this observation. The skewing of the sample towards first and
second year students may affect which of the library’s services these students choose to use. In
addition, the survey did not include a question about diffusion of innovations because I
developed this rhetorical insight after the survey was approved by the IRB and data collection
was underway. Further research may indicate that students are thinking of the library in this
way. The rhetorical argument, however, should not be completely disregarded. I still believe
that by offering various kinds of technology for users to try, library spaces are optimal places for
trialability to occur. In the light of this empirical data, I still believe that Rogers’ theory has
predictive power and that libraries are likely to serve an important role in the diffusion of
innovations. I also still hold true to my claim that the diffusion of innovations and the concept of
trialability plays an important role in convergent invention as expressed by Morgan Library as
well as libraries as a whole. I believe that these trends may be more profoundly expressed in

96

public libraries instead of academic ones. The strategy may be useful, but not to the individuals
surveyed. More research, therefore, should be conducted to determine the nature of this
relationship.
Food and Beverage
On the other hand, as expected from the arguments in Chapter 3, Morgan’s Grind
appeared to be a social hub in both the behavior observations and survey data. Many students
viewed Morgan’s Grind as an integral part of their library experience. Only 71 (33%) of students
indicated that they never use Morgan’s Grind. Students saw getting food and coffee as an
important part of their library experience at doing so was cited many times in the survey data.
Coffee was generally viewed as a break from the day or a scheduled meeting with friends. The
advertising at Morgan’s Grind plays to the perceptions of these students. Their slogan is “Escape
the daily grind.” This slogan indicates that being a student is hard work and that they need a
place to relax or a special treat to get them through the day.
From the behavior observations, it was evident that Morgan’s Grind was a key part of the
inventive process at Morgan Library. A significant number of students made Morgan’s Grind
their first stop in the library. They would come in to the library, grab a beverage and/or snack
then head to other parts of the building. For these users, getting their coffee could be considered
a ritualistic behavior. Getting the coffee mentally prepares them to sit down and work. The
caffeine can wake a person up, help them concentrate or serve as a placebo that makes a person
feel more awake or productive. These users are providing themselves with a treat, an “escape
from the daily grind” before they get down to business. Other users engaged in a similar
behavior. After getting their beverage and/or snack these users stayed in Morgan’s Grind. They
treated Morgan’s Grind as they would any other coffee shop.

97

From my rhetorical work and real-world observations of the place, Morgan’s Grind does
function as an effective third space for users. Students are interesting users of third spaces.
Many (but certainly not all) college students identify the place where they grew up as “home”
and their college living environments as a secondary home. In addition students do not have a
traditional workplace. They move between classrooms, meetings, the gym, offices, place(s) of
employment and public spaces like Morgan Library. Students complicate the notion of a third
place as one between work and home because their workplaces and homes are not clearly
delineated. For students who are employed on campus, this distinction can be even more
complicated.154 Even with these complications, Morgan Library still fills the essential functions
of a third space. It provides a place that for most students is not their residence (temporary or
permanent) for doing their academic work. This place is a break between the home/residence
and the workplace. It is something different, helping Morgan library fulfill the important
requirements of a third space.
Overall, the empirical data mostly mirrored my interpretations of consumptive activity in
Morgan Library. Students readily embraced the strategies of the space to engage in consumptive
activities supportive of Morgan Library’s vision of convergent invention. The differences,
however, are in the details. Technology access was important to users, but they were not as
interested in new technological advances as I predicted. Instead, users wanted to access
technology with which they were familiar instead of always trying new things. Morgan Library
is making appeals for users to trial new technology, but users did not always embrace these
messages. Users also employed Morgan’s Grind in ways that were not fully predicted by the
rhetorical analysis. I expected users to see Morgan’s Grind as part of their library experience
when instead they frequently saw it as its own entity. Several users indicated that they go to

98

Morgan’s Grind for coffee and/or to meet with friends and then do not utilize the rest of the
library space. The faculty and staff of Morgan Library as well as the leadership at Morgan’s
Grind should be aware of this mixed usage.
Leisure
Users at Morgan Library are encouraged to see the space as one of leisure and play.
College students are members of the leisure class and the creative class. Instead of working in
manual labor, students are completing intellectual labor. Their work is to think about ideas and
create, generally developing solutions to problems. Morgan Library strategically encourages
leisure and creativity through liberal usage policies which allow access to almost any website
and through design linkages to outdoor leisure.
“Killing Time” in Morgan Library
In the survey data it was evident that many students were intentionally using Morgan
Library for activities other than academic work. Many students suggested that they use the
library as a break between classes or as a place to relax. Several students indicated that they use
the library to “pass the time between classes,” “hang out” or even “relax.” Other users made it
clear that the library was a “third space” for them. In the survey one user stated, “I est [sic]
lunch almost every day in the library. It is also a good place to go when there is nowhere else
you can go.” One student stated, “I use it as a time to wind down from classes
before/after/during study. I might play a game or just listen to music. It’s a nice place to have
peace and quiet.” Another student stated, “I listen to music and browse the internet for material
not related to research or studying.” Many other students echoed a similar sentiment. They read
for pleasure, browse social networks, or even take a nap. Some students used the library as a
stopover place between classes. One student stated that s/he uses the library to, “Relax between

99

classes, do some light facebooking [sic] or internet surfing, do personal reading, get coffee, use
the restrooms between classes.” Other students found the library to be not just a good stopover
place, but a safe resting place as well. As one student noted, “I often go there to kill time before
classes. Sometimes to find a quiet place to sleep for a while too.” Students need a place to go
between classes and Morgan Library provides them such a place to go.
Students indicate that the library serves an important function in their lives beyond
academics. These are important manifestations of Morgan Library’s value as a third place for
students. For students with a gap between their classes or between class and other commitments,
Morgan Library provides a place to pass the time and perhaps finish some homework while
doing it. Such a function keeps students in the space, which demonstrates its value. Morgan
Library provides a productive space for students to go during gaps in their day. By making itself
available for these functions, Morgan Library draws users in to the facility. These users are then
open to the library’s persuasive message about convergent invention. This usage of the library
also indirectly benefits the university as a whole. With the unavailability of the Lory Student
Center, students, faculty and staff looking for a place to “hang out” on campus have been
displaced. The library absorbs some of this traffic.
Indoor/Outdoor Leisure in Morgan Library
In Chapter Three, I discussed how parts of Morgan Library lead the user to be reminded
of outdoor spaces of leisure. I argued that the construction of the large three story window on
the west side of the building, the courtyard and the exposed brickwork in the entryway serve to
remind students of the presence and availability of outdoor leisure in Colorado. These messages
are not intended to be directly persuasive, but to create an environment in which users do not feel
wholly disconnected from the outside world so they will stay in the space longer or be inspired

100

by the natural world. Because I am analyzing a more subtle persuasive appeal on behalf of the
place, I did not ask any direct questions about outdoor leisure and Morgan Library on the survey.
Behavior observations, however, yielded some indication that the rhetoric may be working.
Users frequently turned their chairs to face outside, both on the large west wall and over the
courtyard. My observations took place during February so users were not in the courtyard, but
they did face towards it.155 By facing chairs towards the natural world, users are incorporating it
into their inventional process.
These observations in concert with the rhetorical analysis indicate that at least some users
are making the connection between the outdoors and their usage of Morgan Library. For
students who choose to work facing the courtyard or the mountains, the outdoors plays a role in
what they would like to see in their field of vision. Perhaps they take comfort or inspiration from
the outdoor views. Perhaps they are new to Colorado and are not used to seeing mountains so
the view is a novelty. Perhaps the outdoors reminds users that there is life beyond the classroom,
such as working out at the Rec Center. In any case, people are choosing to sit in areas that
facilitate outdoor and/or mountain views and Morgan Library is facilitating it. The connection
has been communicated by the library and received by the users.
From these usages of Morgan Library, it is evident that students do see it as a space of
leisure and relaxation and those students do intentionally come to the space to relax. This usage
does not negate Morgan Library as a space of convergent invention. Readers should be aware
that with the absence of the Lory Student Center, the campus population has lost one popular
space for people to go in their spare time.156 This absence may increase the amount of down
time traffic through Morgan Library. If, however, traffic is re-routed to a place of academic
activity, students may be more likely to engage in inventional behavior. It is difficult to divine a

101

direct line of separation between inventional and recreational behavior. Users may come in to
the library, engage in some web surfing and then move on to their work. Or they may start doing
their work and then get distracted by other media. A user may come in to work on their
homework one day and meet a friend for coffee the next. The space exists for the purposes of
convergent invention, but it is up to the individual user in that moment if they wish to use it that
way or not.
Tactical Outliers
Some instances of library usage did not fall directly under the themes expressed in
Chapter Three and discussed above in Chapter Four. Understanding these behaviors provides
more insight into behavior in Morgan Library. These behaviors are important because they
contribute to the environmental aspects of convergent invention. Convergent invention
acknowledges that inspiration for invention may come from a variety of environmental sources,
so any parts of the environment that inspire users are relevant to inventional behavior. Users
leave messages for others, engage in political and social activism, and do deliberately tactical
behavior. These instances all contribute to placemaking behavior in Morgan Library.
Messages for Others
As students move through Morgan Library they leave messages for others. During my
observations I frequently saw people leaving their work on the dry erase boards throughout the
space. These boards would contain anything from chemical formulas to lists of philosophers.
While leaving this work may seem like a lazy act by students, it was intended to communicate to
others. For example, in Figure 4.1, students have worked on formulas and instead of leaving the
correct answer they indicate that the math yields the result of “WTF?”157 Following the
expression, the students caution their fellow library users: “This is why you become a business

102

major.” This remnant is unlikely to influence anyone’s academic plans but it does provide a
chuckle for the next person or group to use the board. By leaving such a message the writers are
aware that more people are going to see their work. This message commiserates with the people
coming later that academic work is hard and can be a struggle. The message may not help
people with their homework (or declaring a major) but it does indicate that academic work
occurs in the building. These messages may also encourage other users to try the whiteboards
for their next group meeting, facilitating more effective collaboration.
Some white board messages touch upon other campus issues. Figure 4.2 shows a board
in one of the group study rooms on the second floor. The photograph was taken in February
2014. The white board features three messages stating, “because you’re worth it….,” “let it go,”
and “it’s not a bad life just a bad day.” In the survey another student stated, “I like to make
sticky notes with compliments on them and place them in random places.” Out of context these
messages seem like a happy, uplifting way to share a smile with a fellow student. Like the
message above, these messages are commiserating with the stressful difficulty of college, albeit
in a less sarcastic way.
Contextually, however, these messages need to be understood as connecting to a much
bigger issue than the stress of calculus. According to the American Psychological Association,
the number of college students with severe mental health problems has been steadily rising since
the mid-1990s.158 This national trend has been felt close to home. Colorado State University
lost two students to suicide in the dorms during the Fall 2013 semester.159 These events
surprised the campus community and lead to a greater emphasis on not only mental health issues
but general compassion and kindness towards fellow students. This mood was crystallized in an

103

email from CSU President Dr. Tony Frank. President Frank is known for his campus-wide
emails on various issues. After the suicides he addressed the campus stating:
Let’s all work to be a little bit kinder, a little bit more decent, a little bit more responsible
toward each other, acknowledging that while we never fully can understand someone
else’s struggles – while we never actually can walk in their shoes – kindness and
compassion never hurt. Make smart choices. Take care of one another.160
The message is very clear: all students at CSU have a responsibility to each other and that the
university is a strong community as a whole. While the students leaving the optimistic messages
for others may not have been directly thinking of Frank’s email, these words speak to a campus
climate in which students care about others, even those they have not met. These messages may
not be directly relevant to convergent invention in and of itself, but they do contribute to a
campus climate in which students are told that they are important. A small smiley face or a postit note with a complement may be all a stressed-out student needs to take a breath and dive in to
their homework. For a student in greater distress the message may remind them that people care
about their well-being. In an extreme circumstance, these messages have life-saving potential.
Political and Social Activism
Leaving positive messages for other students not only contributes to the campus
community but also is a form of social activism, raising attention about an important issue:
student mental health. Another important usage of both Morgan Library and Morgan’s Grind
that facilitates interest in convergent invention has been student activism on political and social
issues.161 Activists are using the library to get students to think about and discuss broader social
problems. I spent some time watching one example of student activism during my behavior
observations. On Monday, February 24 at 9am a group of students were gathered outside
Morgan’s Grind. These students were gathering support and garnering attention for Body
Acceptance Week. The activities of Body Acceptance Week were designed to get students on
104

campus thinking critically about body image and their acceptance (or lack thereof) of their own
bodies. The students outside Morgan Grind were doing one activity designed to promote just
that. They stopped people as they entered the main library or exited Morgan’s Grind and asked
them to write something positive about their body on a post-it note. The post-it notes were stuck
to the large glass wall of Morgan’s Grind for all to see. Participants were then given a stack of
post-it notes advertising Body Acceptance Week and some promotional literature about other
sponsored activities.
This activism did not go directly against the intended usage of the space, but it is still a
tactical expression. People are coming together to use the space in a way that makes sense to
them. Morgan Library was not explicitly designed for events of political or social activism.
CSU has a place designated for those activities: the Plaza. According to the Lory Student
Center’s website, “The Lory Student Center Plaza is a free speech zone where departments and
registered student organizations can reserve a table to provide CSU's community with
information about events, groups, and topics without monetary exchange or solicitation.”162
Body Acceptance Week would be a perfect example of an activity that would generally take
place on the Plaza. The Plaza, however, was under construction at the time and the event took
place in February when it was cold outside. People are more likely to stop and participate when
they are warm. These students tactically repurposed Morgan Library to hold their event in a
more favorable location.
Active Tactical Resistance
Both the survey and behavior observations indicated that deliberately tactical behavior
was not widespread within Morgan Library. Users were generally operating within the confines
provided by the space. For the most part, they felt as if they space met their needs and did not

105

see a reason to change it. Very few people admitted to actively trying to change the space or
intentionally break the rules. As to be expected, however, some library users did engage in
deliberately tactical behavior. For example, one survey respondent admitted to drinking alcohol
within the library, stating “I have drank alcohol at the library, but I did study at the time. . . .”
This is a deliberately tactical behavior because not only does Morgan Library not sell alcohol,
but CSU is a dry campus. Alcohol is prohibited in all places on campus except for the
Ramskellar, the campus bar. Bringing alcohol into Morgan Library requires some thinking
ahead. The student has to acquire the alcohol, which could take time if they are under 21. They
then have to put it into a container and/or mix it with another beverage to bring it in. Engaging
in a directly oppositional tactic such as bringing alcohol into the library requires forethought on
behalf of the user.
The wording of this response provides some cues that the respondent put some thought
into answering the survey question. The ellipsis at the end indicates that the respondent is
trailing off, potentially sheepish about her or his behavior. The inclusion of the statement “but I
did study at the time” also reads to me that the user feels somewhat apologetic about their tactic.
For example, I do not think a student drinking a beer while studying at an off-campus residence
would respond as reflectively. As I read this survey response I see a student who has engaged in
a tactic but is experiencing cognitive dissonance about their action. While active tactical
resistance and repurposing may be present in Morgan Library, the users may not feel good about
engaging in it.
Overall, all of these tactical outliers do contribute to convergent invention in ways large
and small. Users who decided to engage in political and social activism are using the space to
foster larger discourses and collaboration between library users. The space is being repurposed

106

to allow for these discussions. Other tactics, such as consuming alcohol in the library, make a
slight contribution to the environment of Morgan Library, but they are not directly related to the
production of new ideas through convergent invention. These tactics, however, are important for
understanding all of the activity within Morgan Library and not just the activities related to
convergent invention.
Methods and Sample Sizes
The empirical part of this study utilized two research methods: a survey and behavior
observations. The survey was distributed to public speaking instructors, each of whom had the
choice to offer it to their classes or not. They could award participants up to 10 points of extra
credit for completing the research. Behavior observations were conducted throughout the
building. All research was conducted during the first month of the Spring 2014 semester. The
protocols for both the survey collection and behavior observations were approved by the
Colorado State University Institutional Review Board in December 2013. A copy of the full
survey is provided in Appendix I.
Survey Responses
During the Spring 2014 semester, 44 sections of public speaking were taught with a
maximum enrollment of 24 students per section. At the discretion of the instructor, 18 sections
consisting of 406 total students were given the opportunity to participate.163 Therefore 42.5% of
the public speaking students were invited to participate. From the 406 students given the
opportunity to participate, 218 completed the research, yielding a response rate of 53.7%. Out of
the students given the survey, 158 students (39.3%) were offered 10 extra credit points for
participation, 182 students (44.8%) were offered 5 extra credit points and 66 students (16.2%)
were offered no extra credit points.

107

Despite the positive response to the survey, significant limitations should be noted.
Sample composition was a large limitation of the survey data. While the response rate was high
(over 50% of eligible participants responded to the survey), the population surveyed missed a
few clusters of library users. One hundred and seventy five (80.3%) of students were in their
first or second year of college. Because these students may be taking basic courses (like public
speaking) instead of work toward their major, they are likely to have different library usage
needs than students further along in their degree program. For example, one student responded to
the question “Where else besides the library do you do research?” with “I have not needed to do
research yet.” While public speaking is a basic course, not all university departments require it.
The course is required for students in the College of Agricultural Sciences, Warner College of
Natural Resources and some students in the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Natural
Sciences. The course is not required for any students in the Colleges of Business, Health and
Human Sciences, Engineering, and Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, so students in these
disciplines are underrepresented in the sample.164 Graduate students and faculty are also not
included in the sample.
Despite these limitations, the survey provides important epistemic value for
understanding issues of library usage. One of the benefits of survey research is that it generates a
large amount of data. Surveys are an effective tool for discovering large trends in usage. In
analyzing the data it should be noted that research participants tend to over-report behavior that
is seen as positive (such as voting) and underreport negatively perceived behaviors (such as
smoking or drinking).165 Although research participants were told their answers would be
anonymous, some people may have chosen not to report negatively perceived behaviors to avoid

108

potential disciplinary consequences or because they felt the researcher would not be interested in
the information. Misbehavior may possibly be more widespread than indicated by the data.
Behavior Observations
In addition to survey data, I conducted behavior observations during the Spring 2014
semester from Wednesday January 22 through Monday February 24. During my observations I
sat in a place of the library for at least fifteen minutes and took handwritten notes of people’s
behavior.166 These notes included time, date and location information; a record of the
observation, the lens through which I was observing and a possible interpretation of the behavior.
I did not interact with others while doing the observations. Observation times ranged from 9am
to 8pm on weekdays.
Several limitations should be noted in this method. Behavior observations were
conducted during one month of the year and at limited times. There are some important gaps in
observation. This means that any changes in behavior that occur late at night or on the weekends
were not documented. There is also no documentation of how users utilize the Study Cube after
hours and how the library staff clears out the building when they are trying to close.
Furthermore, there are no weekend observations. I chose to limit the sample to the weekdays in
order to engage in more consistent observations. The observations, therefore, lack detail on how
the library changes over the weekend. Because of ethical concerns, I did not observe any private
behavior in the library, such as bathroom facility usage, the items users checked out or read, or
the sites they viewed on the computer. These behaviors are important to library usage, but they
are a user’s personal business, which they have the right to keep confidential. Behavior
observations also cannot record unobservable behavior. For example, from observation I cannot
tell why a person is using their phone. I can only see that they are doing so. Finally, the

109

observations only covered the first half of the semester. Library usage patterns change
throughout the semester, especially during the last week of class and finals. These observations
do not address those changes.
Nonetheless, the strength of behavior observations in generating useful data was in
recording patterns of small, everyday practices. For example, while observing I regularly saw
people get up to get a drink or use the restroom and leave their stuff at a computer unattended.
In addition, the behavior observations showed what people actually did in the library instead of
self-reported behavior, which may be not be completely accurate. For example, a person may
not think that their behavior of leaving their stuff at a computer station while using the restroom
is consequential and therefore they may not report it in a survey or interview. If it is something
they do without actively thinking about it, they also may not report it. As a researcher, however,
I am very interested in this behavior because it shows how people trust the others around them in
the space. Watching people do things in the library shows how they actually behave rather than
how they think they do.
Conclusion
From the survey data it can be concluded that library usage is widespread among the
student body. Only 3 (1%) respondents said that they never visited the library. The data
indicated that while people did use the space, users had varying interpretations of how it should
be used. Students themselves had polysemic interpretations of the space and individual
respondents to the survey gave a variety of reasons for using the library. This research reaffirms
the idea that a space or place can be many things to different people. With a broader sample size
across all library users more perspectives and interpretations of the space would be heard.

110

In addition, my findings support that not only do users use the library but that they more
often then not use it in accord with the prompts of the space’s material rhetoric. While this
finding is not particularly radical, it does provide some important insight into the place. By and
large, an artistic, rhetorical venture was able to uncover the messages communicated by Morgan
Library and the empirical work was able to show how these messages were received. This
finding indicates that the needs of Morgan Library and the needs of its users are in sync. Morgan
Library is paying attention to what its users need and providing these things for them in the
present moment. Overall, the users and the space are in sync with each other leading to a mostly
harmonious working space.
The data, however, also suggests that while the vast majority of the libraries strategic
work is effective, there are some important reasons that students do not follow these strategic
expectations. One important variation between users is their working preferences. In Chapter
Three I focused a lot on the collaborative and social aspects of Morgan Library. From the survey
data, however, it is evident that not all people prefer to work with others. When asked, “Where
besides Morgan Library do you study with others?” students replied with answers such as “I
don’t,” “I prefer not to study with others,” and “I prefer to study by myself.” It is important to
remember that these users’ needs and preferences are important and that spaces such as the
library should accommodate these preferences. Collaboration is an important strategic message
of Morgan Library. Collaboration, however, is not the only way to convergent invention. A
person can doing convergent invention but working on their own. Users who reject the message
of collaboration may feel like they are engaging in a tactic by working alone or that their
preferences are not as important.

111

In summary, the data gathered by surveying and watching library users indicated that
they found more nuance in Morgan Library than the space was promoting. The strategies present
in Morgan Library seemed to direct users to a more technology-driven, collaborative style of
working which utilized large areas of the space. Users, however, rejected this message in favor
of a more personalized approach. Not everyone wanted advanced technology and collaborative
spaces all the time. Users were self-aware of their needs and appropriated the space to fit their
desires at the time they were using it.
Given the mixed record we find at the end of this analysis, greater critical attention must
be brought to bear on rhetoric, materiality, and convergent invention. Now that I have observed
the strategies of Morgan Library (in Chapter Three) and the tactics of users (in Chapter Four) it
is time to put these methodologies together. In the next chapter I will analyze the implications of
convergent invention on Morgan Library. I will then branch out to the larger social
consequences of an information society in an age of convergent invention.

CHAPTER FIVE: CONCLUSIONS
Forbes business writer Panos Mourdoukoutas loves his local library. He also, however,
claims to spend less time there than before. Instead, Mourdoukoutas prefers a different kind of
establishment, a place that many observers see in direct competition with local libraries for
people’s time, space, and attention: Starbucks. As Mourdoukoutas explains:
Starbucks offers a more pleasant and less restrictive environment than my library. At
Starbucks I can use my laptop to browse over newspapers and journals, enjoy a cup of
coffee under the sounds of new age music and use my mobile phone. I can chat with
other patrons. I can download my favorite e-books. And judging from the popularity of
Starbucks, I’ll probably have plenty of company.167
In first reading Mourdoukoutas’s commentary, I was a bit taken aback. Thinking about my own
experiences at Morgan Library, I realized I had done all of these things in the space. I drank
many cups of coffee, read the newspaper, used my laptop, accessed e-books and checked my
phone. I have talked with friends, students, former students, and even random strangers. I also
had plenty of company. It appeared to me that Mourdoukoutas was a bit behind the times.
After greater reflection, however, I believe it is fairer to say that Mourdoukoutas’
comments revealed a communication breakdown somewhere between himself and his local
library. Perhaps his library is behind the times and has not yet been updated to acknowledge the
demands of convergent invention. Or, it is possible that Mourdoukoutas had not made a visit to
his library in a long time and was unaware of the real changes they were enacting to make it a
space much like he had envisioned. In either event, had Mourdoukoutas visited Morgan Library
in the last few years, I think he may have been more willing to grab a cup of coffee and stick
around. Nonetheless, his article demonstrates that while library (re)designs for social interaction
and convergent invention might have come a long way, perceptions about libraries in popular
culture and the entire population of library users are still evolving.
114

Given the unresolved nature of library spaces and the trends toward convergent media, in
this conclusion, I investigate what I believe happens next. First I will explore the implications of
convergent invention in and of itself followed by an examination of its impact on libraries. Next,
I will return to the mixed methodology of this thesis and discuss how these methods can be used
to answer other questions about communication. Following that, I will examine the implications
for the discipline of communication studies as a whole. I will end this thesis by providing some
useful directions for further research.
Implications for Convergent Invention
Convergent invention fundamentally changes the ways in which people think about the
development and creation of ideas. The difference in how research and writing is conceived of
in a library designed for convergent invention versus one that is not is evident when I reflect on
my experience at the Newberry Library in Chicago. The Newberry is the epitome of an “old
school” library in the reader-centered paradigm. Readers must follow strict guidelines for
accessing materials and using material. There were no comfortable chairs and due to library
regulations about preservation, books had to be read on a table. Laptops were allowed in the
library but their use was restricted. It was difficult to find a reliable internet connection or an
outlet.168 At the Newberry, I was encouraged to look at and record some notes on the materials I
was using (road maps) and save the analysis and writing for later. The arrangement of the
Newberry emphasized the act of reading in the traditional sense. As someone socialized in the
learning-centered paradigm and trained to invent convergently, working at the Newberry was a
challenge. I was not accustomed to focusing on one piece of evidence at a time. Inventing in
this environment forced me to change the mental processes I used as a rhetorical scholar. In
contrast, every library I have used since has allowed for the simultaneous acts of research,

115

analysis, speaking, and writing. I attribute the difference to the nature of the Newberry in that
the archives are open for a limited amount of time and others need to use the space and
resources. This is the nature of the reader-centered paradigm in contrast to the learning-centered
paradigm, in which the user has fewer limits on space and resources.
I believe the learning-centered paradigm and its supportive places like Morgan Library
offer a more productive means of rhetorical invention at this present moment than earlier
paradigms. Ultimately convergent invention changes the thought process we use to create
rhetorical texts. Teaching the thought processes behind invention has been a part of rhetorical
theory and education since Aristotle’s topoi. Contemporary education on rhetorical invention
and argumentation in general focuses on how to bring together a wide variety of pieces of
evidence to draw a conclusion. Technology changes the ways in which we think. For example,
typing an essay requires a different thought process than writing it by hand. If a person is typing
an essay they can drag and move sections around, while handwriting or even using a typewriter
would require a massive re-write. Because it is easier to rearrange the materials, a person can sit
down and type what comes to mind and rearrange it later instead of having to completely rewrite their work. This changes the ways in which people write.
In addition, convergent invention acknowledges the nature of contemporary rhetorical
texts. As discussed in Chapter Two with my discussion of McGee, the contemporary rhetorical
text has fragmented. While perhaps rhetorical texts were never “whole” or “unfragmented,” with
the rise of the internet and convergent media today’s texts are more fragmented than ever before.
Even the basic speech has become fragmented. A rhetorical scholar needs to not just consider
what is said in the speech but how it is disseminated and shared. Consider the example of a big
campaign speech. The rhetorical critic not only needs to examine the content of the speech itself,

116

but the context(s) of the speech. Where are people seeing the speech? In what context? What
are they saying about it to their social networks? What do the YouTube comments say? How is
the speech parodied or discussed elsewhere, such as on comedy shows like Saturday Night Live
or The Daily Show? Contemporary rhetors are aware of the new ways in which their content is
consumed so they create speeches that respond to these new ways of viewing a speech. For
example, Barack Obama incorporated Twitter hashtags into his 2012 State of the Union
address.169 Viewers at home could follow his tweets and discuss the speech with other Twitter
users by adding the hashtag #SOTU. People were able to engage with others all across the
United States during the speech by using social media. All of these issues are relevant to the
persuasive message and therefore should be considered by rhetorical scholars.
The implications of fragmentary texts are not limited to communication scholarship.
From my perspective as a rhetorician, communication is inherent to all human actions and to all
scholarly disciplines. Communication does not have to be verbal or written; it can involve many
different senses. As evidenced by the topic of choice for this thesis and the supporting literature,
I believe that communication, persuasion, influence and rhetoric are pervasive forces in our
everyday lives. With that established, I believe disciplines across the liberal arts and the
humanities are focusing on rhetorical texts in different ways. Philosophy and rhetoric have
always been in dialogue. An important part of understanding foreign languages and literatures is
to comprehend communication in another language. Theatre and literature symbolically
communicate messages. The liberal arts, however, are just one part of the university. Students
and scholars from all disciplines are piecing together fragments to invent and learn convergently.
Many of the drawings left on the whiteboards that I observed while writing Chapter Four were
from scientific or mathematical study. The students who were working in that group

117

collaborated to understand an idea. While understanding how to do a certain kind of math does
not directly lead to invention, rhetorical or otherwise, students need to learn the basics to move
on to more complex ideas. Students learning in Morgan Library are pulling together fragments
of communication to understand how they work. This activity is at the heart of learning in the
disciplines and the heart of convergent invention.
Convergent Caveats
There are, however, some important caveats to convergent invention that should be
discussed in order to have a full understanding of the concept at hand. Convergent workspaces
are expensive and have potential environmental negatives. This is not to say that convergent
workspaces are wholly problematic. The full extent of these trends has yet to be observed
because convergent invention itself is not very old. Scholars going forward, however, should
consider these impacts. One of the impacts of convergent invention is the ripple effect of the
consumption that occurs within. In a global economy, a cup of coffee or an iPad consumed in
the United States has effects across the world. One impact may be in electricity use.
Convergent workspaces need to be careful to create energy-efficient spaces and encourage smart
environmental practices among users. In addition, food and beverage can have environmental
impacts. Making food and beverage available increases the amount of waste produced by a
space, which means more energy to recycle, compost or transport this refuse to a landfill.
Laptops, e-readers, gaming consoles and smartphones are made in factories overseas with
questionable labor practices.170 These negatives are not directly visible to the individual using
the workspace but it is important to consider the global impact of this trend.
In addition, convergent invention privileges certain working preferences over others.
When an extroverted, collaborative working environment is held as the ideal, people with a

118

preference for individual and solo work may suffer. In some situations introverts may seem
devalued, less productive or not “team players.” Naomi Karten states “extroverts sometimes see
introverts as withholding ideas, making minimal contributions to group efforts, and being distant
or aloof.”171 This perception may harm introverts in both schoolwork and the workplace. In an
open plan workplace, another type of space for convergent invention, people who need their
space may have a difficult time finding a place to have time for themselves. Individuals with a
preference for introversion may find these workplaces stressful, thus reducing their productivity.
One way in which introverted people may cope with their desire for solitude is to leave the
workplace and retreat to another location that better suits their needs. If the person is not visible
in the office, even if they are available online, colleagues and employers may perceive them as
distant. Collaboration is incredibly valuable to academic and business enterprises, but spaces
should also provide areas for people to have their own personal space. In order to combat overt
or inadvertent privileging of extroverted preferences, places of work need to be mindful of how
their strategies contribute to the needs of all people.
Finally, socioeconomic status plays an important role in convergent invention. In order
to “[read] across different media,” as the National Writing Project states, readers need to have
access to different kinds of media.172 While libraries do provide this access, people without it at
their fingertips at all times may be less apt to use it. Computer usage is also related to
educational attainment and income level. According to Pew’s study of the internet and
American life, only 66% of people with a high school education or less use computers at their
workplace, school, home or elsewhere compared with 89% for those with some college
education and 94% for those with a college education (or more). Household income is a dividing
factor. Only 66% of adults with a household income of $30,000 or less use a computer

119

compared with 84% in the next highest income bracket ($30,000-49,999).173 These are not just
statistically significant bumps but socially significant as well. Going forward scholars should be
aware of these divides and the social justice issues surrounding convergent invention. This may
also prompt those promoting convergent invention to identify ways in which these inequities can
be remedied.
In this section I argued that convergent invention functions as an effective response to the
needs of contemporary invention and contemporary rhetorical texts. Convergent invention is
necessary for a world in which all rhetorical texts have fragmented and scholars across all
disciplines need to bring together the pieces to draw conclusions. In addition convergent
invention incorporates technological innovations that people are actually using into the
inventional process. Rather than attempting to change people, convergent invention adapts to
them. While convergent invention is an effective response to current needs, scholars need to be
aware that it is not perfect. Technology has the potential to cause harm to the environment, shut
out people who prefer to work alone and contribute to socioeconomic inequality. Scholars
should move forward with convergent invention but also be aware of potential problems that
could arise.
Implications for Libraries
Libraries are important sites for the development of convergent invention. They have
been keeping pace with the times and changing with the information revolution. Through the
example of convergent invention, this thesis demonstrates one way in which this is the case.
While I focused specifically on Morgan Library, an academic institution, there are implications
for libraries and institutions across the board. In this section I will discuss the implications of
convergent invention for Morgan Library, academic libraries and libraries as a whole.

120

For Morgan Library
In my overall assessment, designing for convergent invention benefits Morgan Library.
In the contemporary moment with fragmentary texts and a deepening reliance on technology,
designing for convergent invention aligns the needs of users and Morgan Library. Users require
a space to access technology and resources while spaces and places need ways to manage their
users. By creating a space in which the needs of both are met, Morgan Library can foster
productive academic activity. While these benefits should be obvious from earlier in the thesis,
other benefits of Morgan Library’s design choices extend beyond users and faculty in the present
moment.
One of the important design choices in Morgan Library is the offering of a variety of
study spaces. Users have the choice of where they want to study and do their academic work.
This is important because users’ needs change with the type of invention they want to do. I
believe that Morgan Library is currently doing a good job at staying with the times and the
contemporary best practices in library design, but the faculty and staff need to remember the
basics. I am concerned that the space may not come to reflect the needs of its users. In
particular, I am worried about the presence of silent study space. While some areas are
designated for silent work, I believe that Morgan Library has done the minimum necessary.
Silent study space may not be glamorous, but it needs to be preserved. As user needs change,
Morgan Library should consider conducting periodical surveys and perhaps interviews and focus
groups as well to determine if the space is still meeting user needs.
Morgan Library also plays an important role on campus. It is an accessible place where
students can go to work on their academic work. In the survey data, several respondents
indicated that they use it as a common meeting place on campus. It has also absorbed student

121

needs other than those dictated by convergent invention. When the Lory Student Center reopens
in Fall 2014, I expect to see a change in usage of Morgan Library. Students are likely to be
drawn to the remodeled student center because it is new and they want to see what it is like. In
addition, the new LSC will have more food options than Morgan Library, including not only a
coffee shop but several food options and a bar. This may draw traffic away from Morgan
Library and Morgan’s Grind. Faculty and staff, therefore, need to be concerned with how their
usage patterns will change. I believe that if this research was conducted next academic year, I
might observe a downturn in behavior not related to convergent invention because another site
for this behavior exists. Morgan Library may be repurposed because student traffic is displaced.
This analysis indicates that Morgan Library is not just part of the educational experience, but the
social experience of Colorado State University.
Designing for convergent media in Morgan Library is also a net positive for the library’s
reputation amongst its peer institutions. Historically, Morgan Library has not had a good
reputation with the leading academic library organization, the Association of College and
Research Libraries (ACRL).174 Academic libraries are frequently in conversation with and about
each other through academic journals, conferences and interpersonally. Morgan Library is
looking to change and improve its reputation. In addition, Morgan Library is drawing positive
attention with one innovative program. On the second floor the Adult Learner and Veteran
Services offices offers a program called the Ram Kidz Village. Student-parents can drop off
their children with the service and stay in the library to do their schoolwork. According to
program director Tina Hopkins-Dukes, this is a unique service for academic libraries. Other
libraries looking to add a similar program have contacted her.175 This not only pushes library
design and services further, but adds to the reputation of both CSU and Morgan Library. Ram

122

Kidz Village is an innovative use of space that allows student-parents to do their own inventional
work while knowing their kids are occupied. This forward-thinking program has taken the needs
of an ignored population, student-parents, into consideration and filled their spatial needs. The
innovative thinking encouraged by places like Morgan Library has come back to improve the
library itself.
In addition to considering the needs of the library contemporarily, library designers need
to attempt to prepare for the potential needs of the library in the future. In an era of paradigm
shift in which book-centered libraries are converted to learning-centered libraries it is difficult to
anticipate the future needs of a library space. Contemporary library remodeling projects and new
construction are trying to be as flexible as possible to accommodate an unpredictable future. As
library architect Steven M. Foote explained, “The desire is for spaces that are efficient, that can
be used by combinations of faculty and students in both private and group configurations
simultaneously, equipped with adjustable, multi-media formats and tools, and that can easily
change over time.”176 Library spaces need to be as flexible as possible so that future librarians
and users with different requirements can modify the spaces to meet their current needs. The
design of Morgan Library takes these factors into account. There are many group study rooms
for students to use as well as classrooms on the first floor. These classrooms can be upgraded
with new technology when the present items go out of date. Electricity use and access is and
will likely continue to remain an issue for Morgan Library and its users. Outlets are strategically
placed around the space allowing for more access and greater flexibility in the future.
For Academic Libraries
The trend of convergent libraries as exemplified in academic libraries across the country
will likely continue. Academic researchers in the field of library and information science have

123

paid particular attention to the spatial needs of library users in recent times. With the ascension
of the learning-centered paradigm the most popular journals about academic libraries (portal:
Libraries and the Academy and College & Research Libraries) have had a slew of articles
dedicated to library remodeling and the spatial needs dictated by technology. As more libraries
are designed in the convergence centered learning paradigm that paradigm will become more
entrenched. Students will come to expect certain designs, facilities and services and libraries
will produce them to meet the demands of students and the administration that wishes to lure
students to campus. The learning-centered designs that foster convergent invention will
reinforce themselves as they become more popular. Libraries have adapted to survive and will
need to continue to do so in the future.
One important adaptation is the consideration of future needs. Much like I discussed in
my analysis of Morgan Library, academic libraries need to consider that their needs today are
likely to be different from their needs five or ten years down the road. Flexible space is an
important part of convergent invention in the contemporary moment. Libraries should consider
how their spaces can stay flexible as needs change. As a library faculty and staff approaches a
renovation, remodeling, a new space design or even the purchase of new furniture, they should
make changes with an eye to flexibility. Renovations and new construction can be expensive
and wasteful undertakings. Faculty and staff need to take future uses into account when
designing their spaces.
In preparing for both present and future usages of library space, faculty and staff need to
keep in mind that while digitization may reduce the need for as large of a book collection, books
will still remain part of the academic library for the foreseeable future. Many college and
university libraries serve as repositories of institutional, local, state and even national historical

124

documents. Academic libraries also hold on to older and rare academic works that may be out of
print and/or not available digitally. While most people will not have a reason to go back into the
historical archives to view the history of the university or the town in which it is located, these
archives are important preservation sites for future generations. Older academic works may not
be frequently used, but they are still important parts of academic study.177 The library does not
just exist to provide its users with a place to work in the present moment, but to preserve
information for the scholars to come. Academic libraries need to hold on to these records.
Libraries should try to digitize what they can, but in many cases this would prove impossible due
to the kinds of artifacts available or the cost of doing so. While academia can be a home for
radicals, it is also a place of the preservation of tradition.
For Libraries in General
Overall, I believe that convergent invention provides libraries with an opportunity to
expand their services and their reach into the community. Whether it is the general populace
served by a public library, a campus served by an academic library, a school served by a library
media center or a specialized library serving a specific group or interest, libraries can only make
a positive impact if potential users know the types of resources and services they can provide. In
order to make an impact to their full potential, libraries need to make their services clear to their
target audience. Misconceptions about the value of the library, like those of Panos
Mourdoukoutas, could lead users away from the library in a time when the library is expanding
the most. The material rhetoric of the library may draw users into the space and compel them to
stay, but in order to be affected by the rhetoric users need to be exposed to it. It may seem
strange that an institution designed to be free of cost needs to advertise, but doing so may invite
more people into the space.

125

Another important consideration for libraries is what to do with older books that are no
longer needed in the collection. Libraries need to engage in a process called weeding to remove
old books from the collection. Books are removed if they are old, in poor shape, or no longer
meet the collection development goals of the library.178 Weeding is important because it
provides an up to date collection for users to search while removing unnecessary items taking up
space.179 With more books, especially popular literature, being offered digitally libraries are
weeding out redundant parts of their collections. Once these books are removed from the
collection libraries face important questions of convenient and environmentally conscious
disposal.180 Books are becoming a less central part of the library and it is important that libraries
have a way to get these books out of their collections. Libraries without a way to get rid of these
older books may continue to hold on to them, which means that floor space is being used
inefficiently. Other libraries may move these books to an off-site storage location, but this costs
time and money for institutions. As a whole, the library profession needs to consider how to best
deal with this issue.
Librarians in any sector need to engage in a reflexive praxis about their work. Because
convergent invention is a new paradigm there are potential effects of which librarians, scholars
and users may yet be unaware. This is not to say that librarians and other information
professionals should be hesitant to move forward with innovation, but that they should take some
time to think of the possible implications. As I discussed in my views on the caveats of
convergent invention earlier in this chapter this new paradigm has the potential to negatively
impact the environment, alienate people who prefer to work alone and deepen the socioeconomic
divide. Practioners should be cognizant of these potentials for harm as they move forward with
their work.

126

One way to be aware of potentials for harm is to pay attention to the tactics of users. No
matter how good libraries get at creating strategic spaces, users will almost always find a
different use for them. For example, Morgan Library was not explicitly designed as a place for
people to take a nap, yet users frequently take naps within the space. One of the themes in The
Practice of Everyday Life that drew me to de Certeau was his belief in subverting the authority of
a space. I believe there is some pleasure for users in subverting authority and operating on one’s
own terms. Users should not follow the rules of a place simply for the sake of doing so, but
because those rules make sense and improve the environment of the space. Users, however,
should not remain oblivious to their environment and they should make the choice to rebel if
their needs change. I predict that such tactics will occur if and when the current paradigm of
library design is deemed insufficient for developing inventional needs. Library faculty and staff
need to pay attention to these tactics because they indicate that something is not working for
users.
Implications for Method
An important part of my scholarly goals for this thesis was testing epistemology. I was
curious if the highly theoretical rhetorical work of de Certeau (and others) could be combined
with a more empirical approach. De Certeau provides some interesting thoughts on how people
move through space, specifically through their use of strategies and tactics, but his thoughts are
based in his observations and not systematic data. Part of my intentions with this thesis was to
determine if strategies and tactics could be observed in a more systematic way and to see what
kinds of conclusions about rhetoric and behavior could be drawn from this analysis. I found that
the theory and the empirical application overlapped in an epistemically productive manner.
Overall, I believe that mixed methodology research has strong potential within rhetorical

127

scholarship and I encourage researchers to consider this approach. In addition to providing
insights about Morgan Library as a text, this deployment of method provides some insights on
epistemology as well.
The Limits of Strategies and Tactics
While engaging in these and other tactics, users are squarely on library property. As de
Certeau indicates, “The space of a tactic is the space of the other. Thus it must play on and with a
terrain imposed on it and organized by the law of a foreign power.”181 The tactical act takes a
place and repurposes it to better fit the needs and desires of the user(s). Methodologically,
dividing strategies and tactics creates a bit of a false dichotomy because tactics have an effect on
strategies. As de Certeau notes:
Tactics are procedures that gain validity in relation to the pertinence they lend to time—
to the circumstances which the precise instant of an intervention transforms into a
favorable situation to the rapidity of the movements that change the organization of a
space, to the relations among successive moments in action, to the possible intersections
of durations and heterogeneous rhythms, etc.182
The entities responsible for producing strategies (in this case, Morgan Library) respond to tactics
by incorporating them into their strategies. This process is what Giles Deluze and Félix Guattari
call deterritorializations and reterritolizations. As they note, “As a general rule, relative
deterritorializations (transcoding) reterritorialize on a deterritorialization that is in certain
respects absolute (overcoding).”183 In other words, deterritorlalization and reterritorialization
describe how control of a space shifts between different entities. Deterritorialization can be
linked to de Certeau’s tactics in which users take away previously established control.
Reterritolization is linked to strategies in which the entity in charge of the space replaces it with
a new kind of control. Strategies and tactics, deterritorialization and reterritolization are not
static forces; they are fluid and respond to the messages of the other.

128

This process of strategies and tactics influencing each other through deterritorialization
and reterritolization can be seen in Morgan Library. The furniture is easily moved around to
accommodate different groups. An item like an ottoman is easily moved to another location.
People who wish to nap can find comfortable furniture, including couches, on which to do so.
Nowhere in the published library policies is napping prohibited nor are there signs not allowing
it. Morgan Library has anticipated the tactics and incorporated it into its strategies, making these
bodily activities part of the expected practices of everyday life in the space.
A methodological issue regarding strategies and tactics becomes evident from this
analysis. It is difficult to fully separate a strategy from a tactic because they so strongly interact
with and influence each other. During my writing process I had difficulty sorting observations
into strategies and tactics. For example, I struggled with the introduction to Chapter Four in
determining if the rhetorical theory student approaching me was engaging in a strategy or a
tactic? How should I interpret the act of approaching a GTA outside of office hours or class?
Was it an act encouraged by the space, and therefore a strategy, or was it a repurposing of the
available resources in Morgan Library, and therefore a tactic? I believe it had elements of both.
It was strategic in that Morgan Library is a place that encourages collaboration. It was also
tactical in that my purpose of being in Morgan Library was not collaboration but observation.
The act could be framed in multiple ways.
Strategies and tactics are a valuable way of thinking about spaces and places, but scholars
need to be cognizant of the overlap between these concepts. In the future, scholars should spend
some time discussing strategies and tactics individually but then they should bring these findings
together to see how they interact, similar to my work in this thesis. In addition, while de
Certeau’s work is highly theoretical from the rhetorical perspective, scholars should also

129

consider how to research specific strategies and tactics. I believe that some empirical methods
may help identify strategies. For example, an interview with a member of the design team of a
space could identify some of the intentional strategies used to direct usage. Extended behavior
observations could bring less obvious strategies to the forefront. De Certeau’s work is incredibly
useful for identifying the ways in which people use space, but scholars should consider that
strategies and tactics are not discrete entities and that work outside of rhetorical methods might
be the most effective for understanding both strategies and tactics.
Mixed Methodology Rhetorical Research
This thesis shows that the combination of rhetorical and empirical methods can be used to
draw conclusions about communication that is fragmented. Usage patterns, materiality and the
rhetoric of space and place are very fragmentary texts. This research provided access to those
fragments by synthesizing the experiences and usage patterns of many students. In short, this
method allows critics to do the job (in another way), as McGee states, of constructing a text for
analysis.
I believe that doing a mixed-methodology study, such as the one conducted here, is an
excellent way for a critic to construct a fragmentary text. While this interpretation is not within
the original scope of McGee’s work, I would encourage rhetorical scholars to extend his
concepts to find ways of constructing fragmentary texts. As an expert library user, my casual
observations of the space are tinted by my experiences. Having systematic observations of
behavior and survey data allows me as a critic to construct a more detailed text. From this data I
can put together a more accurate picture of usage in Morgan Library. Without conducting
behavior observations or surveying people I would have very little idea as to what they are doing
in Morgan Library. The fragmentary nature of this everyday behavior may lead some scholars to

130

determine that it is outside the purview of rhetorical scholarship and may instead belong to the
disciplines of interpersonal or organizational communication. Under a framework of materiality,
however, I would disagree. Materiality assumes that the physical is rhetorical and therefore the
ways in which people use their physical resources is rhetorical as well. Just because a text is
difficult to delineate does not make it less rhetorical.
Strategies and tactics are primary examples of the kinds of fragmentary rhetorical acts
and texts amendable to this mixed methods approach. While some of these behaviors may be
publically observed in a permanent form (such as a “Quiet Study Area” sign), many of these
strategies and tactics are not so readily observable. For example, from my own college
experience and just common sense I assumed that alcohol consumption occurred in the library.
While CSU is technically a dry campus, alcohol will be present and students, such as the one
discussed above, are known to “flask” it into various locations including the library. My
commonsense everyday hunch, however, is not sufficient evidence for academic research and
critique. The only way to access this student tactic and confirm that alcohol consumption
happens in Morgan Library is through a survey.
Through behavior observations I was able to see another tactic: users using furniture in
unconventional ways. During my observations I saw users rearranging furniture, putting their
feet up on chairs and sitting on tables. Unlike bringing alcohol into the library, which requires
planning and forethought, moving furniture is not something most users devote time to thinking
about. They simply pick up the chair or ottoman, move it to the desired location and carry on
with their day. This is significant, because if students were asked if they engaged in any
“resistive” or “rule-breaking” acts they would think to list alcohol consumption as one but not

131

furniture moving. Paring a survey with behavior observations allowed different kinds of tactics
to come to the forefront.
Given what I view as the success of this approach in this thesis, I believe this and similar
methodologies may be useful for other rhetorical texts. Some suggestions for future research
may be to understand how people interact and communicate in a place designed for a communal
purpose. For example, a scholar could study how people in a religious congregation use their
worship space. I would suggest a mixed methodology approach to examine spaces and places
that people visit on a regular basis to get a sense of habitual practices. This is different from
examining a museum or memorial that has a lot of unique visitors and not as many repeat
visitors. In general, I would suggest that scholars should consider a mixed methodology
approach to behavior that they perceive as a rhetorical text. I perceived the behavior of users in
Morgan Library as a rhetorical text under de Certeau’s description of people moving through
spaces as a calculated act. I realized, from my reading of McGee, that this behavior was not just
a rhetorical text, but a highly fragmented one. My job as a critic then, was to take this highly
fragmented text and create it. I chose to do so through empirical methodologies.
Implications for the Discipline of Communication Studies
This research returned to one of the canonical cornerstones of rhetorical studies:
invention. Even 2000 years after Aristotle wrote On Rhetoric and Cicero delineated the five
canons, rhetorical invention remains a vital part of communication scholarship and it is unlikely
to lose its importance in the future. As John Muckelbauer notes in his aptly titled book The
Future of Invention:
In raising the problem of the future for invention, we are faced with the task, not simply
of inventing a new and different concept of invention, but of refiguring futurity itself. As
a result, such an effort cannot content itself with overwriting or replacing a more
traditional concept. It cannot present itself, for example, the most recent, upgraded
132

model of the future. In fact, in a very particular sense, such an invention, while certainly
not the same, cannot be considered different at all.184
Rhetorical invention will not just be relevant in the future; it will create it. The process of using
rhetorical invention to talk about the future and what it may be like is part of creating that future.
The topics discussed while conceiving of “the future” have changed since ancient times, but
rhetorical invention remains central. Just because technology has undergone a radical change
does not mean that the old teachings are not relevant. Rhetorical scholars should pay attention to
how old theory can shed light on new processes.
More narrowly, I believe this research opens the door to a new niche in communication
scholarship. As discussed in the literature review of Chapter Two, communication scholars have
taken to studying memorials, museums, and archives as rhetorical artifacts. These artifacts are
designed to present a certain ideology to those viewing them. I believe looking to libraries in
similar ways would benefit the scholars who have developed this line of inquiry. While
museums and memorials may be viewed as having a specific “agenda,” libraries are generally
viewed as being apolitical and non-ideological places dedicated to intellectual openness and
access. This assessment simplifies the role of libraries. Providing access to information,
instruction on how to use it and the technology with which to do it are ideological and potentially
political undertakings. Communication scholarship on the rhetorical messages of libraries is
important because it helps uncover these meanings. When users are unaware that they are
encountering a persuasive or influential message, their guard is down and they are more
susceptible to persuasion or influence. The popular assumption that the library is “neutral”
means that users are very susceptible to influence in how they engage in rhetorical invention.
Communication scholars, especially those working in the materiality of space and place, are
well-equipped to provide this essential critique.
133

In addition, scholars in Communication Studies should look outside the discipline to
discuss new and different rhetorical texts. I personally believe that Rhetoric and Library and
Information Science are natural academic allies. Scholars in Library and Information Studies
examine how information gets disseminated, organized, made available and hidden from others.
While these concerns may not have previously impacted rhetoric, with rhetorical texts being
spread online, the ways in which texts are encountered (or not encountered) affects the ways in
which they are perceived. Current work, both in this thesis and elsewhere, shows that
information is both mediated and rhetorical and that access to it shapes how people view the
world. Scholars in library and information science focus on how that information gets into
people’s hands or gets lost along the way. While this is important work, I feel that the critical
aspect is sometimes lost. As a scholar with a background in both communication studies and
library and information science, I would like to see our critical bent applied to the information
age. Information usage is an important text for critical analysis.
Future Research
The work in this thesis only begins a broader conversation at the intersection of libraries,
invention, and rhetoric. Indeed, several areas for future research become apparent as this thesis
comes to a close. First, while many writers have lamented the impending death of the library,
these predictions are simply not true. Therefore, continued research on the evolving nature of
libraries in the face of these claims becomes vital. Library engagement is vitally important
across various strata of society. According to the Pew Research Internet Project, the majority of
Americans are engaged with their (public) libraries. Their data indicates that 30% of Americans
above age 16 can be described as “highly engaged” with their public libraries. Thirty-nine
percent of Americans fall into “medium engagement” categories. The data indicated that only

134

14% of Americans over age 16 are not engaged in any way with their public library. 185 With
86% of Americans having some engagement with their public library, scholars need to continue
to pay attention to these vital parts of society.
Second, while this thesis addresses academic libraries, similar research into the rhetorical
aspects of other types of libraries should continue. In particular, two important types of libraries
have been left out of this research: public libraries and K-12 school libraries. Public libraries
such as BiblioTech, have been designed to allow for greater access and usage of technology.
Even small libraries have added access to technology, such as e-readers. When I was in college I
volunteered at Brandon Public Library, a one-room library in a rural Wisconsin town of less than
1000 people. They offered e-readers to their users and it was there that I first tried one for
myself. Both Morgan Library and the Brandon Public Library are engaging in convergent
invention: they are just doing it differently.
In addition, I believe the concept of convergent invention needs to be further developed
and refined. Higher education is not the only site of rhetorical invention. While this thesis uses
an academic library as the starting point, it would be erroneous to think of academia as the only
relevant place of convergent invention. More research into convergent invention should focus on
the inventional needs of children. Inventional behavior does not begin in high school or college.
A child with a crayon can create a rhetorical text. This research can be conducted in both public
libraries and K-12 school media centers. It is important to research the information behavior of
young people because they are just learning how to use the vast quantity of resources available to
them. In addition, these environments affect the ways in which parents, guardians and other
caregivers teach the next generation about how to use information. As Dresang and Koh explain:
Youth information behavior is a complex process of interplays among various factors,
such as young people’s cognitive status, identity formation and value negotiation, and
135

social interaction within a context. Reaching beyond technological determinism, the
typology of youth information behavior identifies children’s engagement in and
interaction with digital media as the interplay of cognitive, noncognitive, and
sociocultural factors.186
All of these factors are crucial to the environmentally centered focus of convergent invention.
As children learn to use information technology they are developing habits that will influence the
rest of their lives. It is important for researchers in communication, and library and information
science and education to think critically about the library spaces in which youth are using
information and technology.
While I chose the convergent invention of children as an example, it is important to see
how this type of invention is used in many other settings. Convergent invention has the
possibility to open doors, but also to shut them. More research should focus on how convergent
invention, as articulated in various library spaces, invites or discourages certain groups of people
from participating. For example, a study could focus on how convergent invention can improve
or limit access for individuals with a wide range of disabilities. Another study could discuss how
the local library improves technological literacy or excludes technical neophytes.
Overall, I believe research in this area should also take a social justice perspective.
Information access is critical to how people interact with the world and make decisions. This
does not, however, mean that such access is completely neutral. Various hierarchies shape the
ways in which people access information and these hierarchies frequently represent existing
power structures in society. As Matthew Hindman states in his book The Myth of Digital
Democracy:
Again and again, this study finds powerful hierarchies shaping a medium that continues
to be celebrated for its openness. This hierarchy is structural, woven into the hyperlinks
that make up the Web; it is economic, in the dominance of companies like Google,
Yahoo! and Microsoft; and it is social, in the small group of white, highly educated, male
professionals who are vastly overrepresented in online opinion.187
136

To fully understand the social implications of convergent invention it is essential to consider who
is being left behind. While writing this thesis I have thought of a few areas in which people may
be out of a society based on technology. Convergent invention depends on technology and so
much access to technology depends on socioeconomic status. As I discussed earlier in this
chapter, access to the internet is hampered by low socioeconomic status. Access may also be
limited by a person’s location. While a digital library such as Bibliotech is helpful to lowincome urban areas, low-income rural areas are likely to face different challenges. Some of
these challenges include a lack of information infrastructure (such as poor or no internet service)
and large distances to public libraries. To improve access for all people in the United States
future research should also investigate any divide between rural and urban areas. In addition, a
lot of materials are written in English. It would be wise to study how language barriers are
formed or broken by convergent invention.
Finally, I would encourage future research into the role(s) libraries, both public and
academic, play in the diffusion of innovations. Libraries provide a place for people to try new
technology but it is unclear if providing access in the library impacts the purchasing decisions of
users. A study of library users would provide more information in this arena. In a world of
convergent invention, libraries are places of consumer behavior. As I mentioned in Chapters
Three and Four, I believe that libraries are, or have the potential to be, places where people trial
new technological innovations to determine if they want to adopt them for themselves. A more
systematic study of this process using Everett Rogers’ theories in Diffusion of Innovations would
provide libraries with a more accurate picture of how their services are used.
It is also important to consider libraries as spaces of diffusion of innovation for economic
reasons. With the advent of convergent invention there is a deeply woven connections between

137

for-profit technology companies and nonprofit, public service libraries. I am not trying to argue
that such a connection is a negative. Both sectors have the chance to benefit from each other. It
should, however, be considered that libraries may become a space even more increasingly
dominated by corporate interests. These corporate interests may then gain the power to dictate
aspects of technological adoption by libraries with these choices not being made in the best
interests of the library or the library’s users. As libraries become more convergent it would be
wise to pay attention to these potential conflicts of interest.
Conclusion
Despite his limited use of his local library, Panos Mourdoukoutas argues it should not try
to compete with Starbucks. Instead, he values the contribution of both institutions to his local
community. To demonstrate the value of both, he makes an interesting suggestion:
But why compete? Why not partner? Simply put, Starbucks and local libraries
supplement each other nicely—they are both “third places” with different rules of
conduct, catering to different community segments. That’s a good reason to have a
Starbucks store in every library. With digitalization turning traditional books into
collectors’ items, it’s about time for libraries to develop a new business model, utilizing
their resources more efficiently and effectively, making less space for book stacks and
solitary rooms for traditional readers and more space for Starbucks-style space for the
modern reader.188
In this statement, Mourdoukoutas brings together several themes of the contemporary library,
both public and academic. He discusses that libraries and Starbucks are both third places with
different roles. Mourdoukoutas also acknowledges that libraries are a business and need to
operate under financial constraints. While libraries are not-for-profit, part of a larger non-profit
(such as a college or university) or a government entity, they do need to make prudent decisions
in management. Finally, Mourdoukoutas draws out what can be an unpleasant truth: that
libraries and corporations are merging more than ever before.

138

What Mourdoukoutas fails to realize, however, is that many of his ideas are going into
practice in libraries across the country. BiblioTech, for example, went all-digital as a business
decision. By going digital they are able to provide more materials and services to their lowincome neighborhood. Other libraries are opening themselves up as community centers. For
example, the public library in the town in which I grew up completed a remodeling project
within the past two years. One of the key additions was space for community meeting rooms.
Groups such as scout troops, community service clubs and even the local knitting guild can use a
room for their get-togethers. The library also added a coffee cart where library users can donate
money for a cup of joe.
These libraries and many like them are demonstrating that the library is still a vital part of
schools and communities. Many scholars and columnists, some cited within this thesis, have
written pieces lamenting the death of the library, the “third place,” and general community in the
United States of America. With the advent of Google, who needs libraries and librarians? The
answer? A lot of people. Maybe even all of us. As I write this conclusion in Morgan Library I
am seeing visual confirmation that the library is not dead. The information profession could
have rolled over and given up with the advent of the internet. Instead, librarians and other
information professionals have embraced the information age. By creating the learning-centered
paradigm of library design and embracing the new methods of convergent invention, the library,
public and academic, digital and print, has remained a vital part of contemporary society. The
information age has not killed the library; it has expanded it.

In the 20th century rhetorical scholars challenge the centrality of persuasion to rhetoric.
Scholars consider that persuasion may include less direct appeals designed to influence the
viewer rather than directly persuade her or him. In addition, feminist scholars critically examine
the concept of “persuasion” as a whole. For example, Cindy Griffin’s theory of invitational
rhetoric encourages people to explain their perspectives and explore the perspectives of others
rather than jumping straight to persuasion.

include “adult content,” the book also straightforwardly addresses issues facing teenagers, such
as sexual expression and drug use. By challenging the book’s presence on school reading lists
and in libraries, the people doing so are not just discussing the book, but contributing to a larger
social discourse on how we discuss controversial issues.

Criticism in these areas is not limited to instances of overtly problematic rhetoric.
Many ideological critics and criticisms turn to less obvious and more insidious examples of
racism, sexism, hetronormativity and ableism. As I will discuss in other parts of this thesis,
when a person’s defense are down, they are more susceptible to a persuasive message.

The reader should note that ethos was to be created internal to the speech and is not
based on an audience’s previous knowledge of the speaker or their position in society. In
describing ethos Aristotle notes, “And this should result from the speech, not from a previous
opinion that the speaker is a certain kind of person.” (38-39). In contemporary times, we view
ethos as both internal to the speech but also created by outside forces.

While relieving oneself is a necessary everyday experience, doing so in public has
larger political and social implications. As queer scholar Issac West notes, “Public bathrooms
are far from a trivial concern given that face-to-face publicity is enabled and constrained in
important ways by the availability of safe and accessible public bathrooms.” See Isaac West,
“PISSAR’s Critically Queer and Disabled Politics,” Communication & Critical/Cultural Studies

123

The issue was first raised in an editorial by Tyanna Slobe in April 2013 (Ibid.). Slobe
argued that the CSU campus needed more gender-inclusive spaces for students who do not
identify with the gender binary. The issue was revisited on September 9, 2013 by Anna Mitchell
and October 23, 2013 by Michaela Jarrett.

As a critic, I think it is important to point out the relationship of both myself and my
readers to such a change. Reading has not only been redefined, but redefined in my (our)
lifetime(s). As a youth I spent my days with my nose in a book; today, I would be missing
essential elements of what constitutes a reader. At the ripe old age of twenty-four, I am not even
sure I am allowed to use the phrase “redefined in my lifetime,” but it is true.

Several retailers engaged spatial strategies to make crowds safer for all. Best Buy taped off
pathways on the floor to point consumers towards certain merchandise. Wal-Mart staggered
sales events to avoid a large rush of people at once, starting some deals at 6pm and 8pm on
Thanksgiving Day and another event at 8am Friday. Target purposefully spread its bargains
throughout the store so shoppers would not be congregating in one area

Most contemporary libraries feature an open stack design where users are free to look
through the available collection of books on the shelves. In some libraries, the book stacks are
hidden. Users must request the books they want to read and staff members bring out the books.
Closed stacks allow books to stay more organized and better preserved but at the cost of easy
accessibility. In addition, open stacks allow users to browse. Because classification systems put
books related to similar topics close together, browsing can lead to users discovering more books
related to their topic.
133

Some archives stored within libraries are designed to promote preservation instead of
widespread and frequent use. That being said, the overwhelming amount of items in a college or
university library are designed to circulate to the library users.

Linux is an open-source operating system generally used by people with a more
advanced computer usage skill set. This analysis would be more interesting if the library chose
to provide Linux based computers because there are a variety of forms (“distributions”) of Linux.
Morgan Library would not only be choosing to offer Linux, but choosing the form to offer,
further directing the technology usage of its patrons.

I did, however, think the Chromebook might be good for my mother who does not
currently own a computer but is considering getting one in the future. She looks to me, her only
child, as someone who is technologically savvy and can help her make a good choice. Morgan
Library’s decision to purchase Chromebooks for users in Colorado has the potential to influence
my mother’s adoption (or lack thereof) of this technology in Wisconsin.

This student has given her verbal permission to appear in my thesis.

It should be noted that I could have declined to spend a great deal of time with the
student because I was on my own personal time and not in office hours, class or a scheduled
appointment. Personally, however, I frequently struggle to say “no” to helping someone, even
“off the clock.”
150

Upon further observation, approaching people (even people a person does not know)
and asking for help is a fairly common practice in Morgan Library. I observed some students
approaching others for help and some other students even approached me. During my
observations two students approached me about specific coursework. One asked me if I was the
GTA for News Writing and one asked if I was in their Biology class. Neither of these were true,
but the users did approach me. Another user asked for my help on some citations while we were
sitting at adjacent computers in the first floor lab. She heard me have a brief conversation with
one of my graduate school classmates, inferred I was a GTA and asked me for help on her
assignment. These examples all show that approaching other users in Morgan Library to ask for
help is a common occurrence.
151

It is important to realize that for some students with disabilities, these actions may not
apply or may be more difficult. This is still an important issue of materiality, because a person’s
body is affecting how they engage with technology to do rhetorical invention. Morgan Library
takes these material issues of invention and disability into account by providing assistive
technology rooms for students with disabilities.

Unfortunately for my research, Morgan Library began to offer more options after my
study had concluded. Two of these options were the Chromebooks and Wacom drawing tablets.
Surveying students on their usage of these would have added more nuance to my analysis.
154

For example, when I worked at the campus library as an undergraduate I had difficulty
using the building for academic work because I thought of it as “employment” rather than
“scholarly activity.” I worked a lot of hours and was trained to do multiple positions, so even if I
was there to do my own schoolwork, I was frequently asked questions related to library business.
155

I wish I could have observed this behavior throughout more of the semester. I think
that people may change the direction they face based on the weather. In addition, I believe that
people may face the windows more frequently as the seasons change. They may be excited
about the first snowfall or the first few warm days of spring. Unfortunately due to the time
constraints of completing this thesis I was unable to conduct the necessary observations to
determine the nature of this relationship. Future research in this area would be benefitted by a
longer period of research.
156

It may have been a productive exercise to ask students how the construction of the
Lory Student Center affected their use of Morgan Library. Many of the respondents, however,
were first year students, so they have not ever had full access to the LSC. A broader sample size
may have gotten at this issue more accurately.

Student gatherings tend to happen on the plaza by the Lory Student Center. With the
construction and loud machinery, however, a great deal of this traffic has been diverted. In
addition, the students wanted people to stop and talk for a while, which would have been difficult
in the cold of February.

Another interesting facet of the Newberry Library was their security procedures.
Unlike most institutions where a person goes through security before entering, Newberry Library
users undergo a security check while exiting to be sure that they have not brought any materials
out with them. Every time I left, I had to show the security guard the inside of my laptop, my
backpack and my lunchbox to make sure I had not taken anything out with me.

I used a fair bit of old theory in this thesis. For example, in Chapter Two I cited John
Waite Bowers chapter on the prescientific function of rhetorical criticism. Morgan Library
owned the book but stored it off-site due to low usage. Without access to this older and lesserknown article, however, I would have a difficult time accessing and citing this important piece of
152

literature to describe my methodological and epistemological approach. By preserving a copy of
this text, Morgan Library is contributing to my scholarship.

While I am all in favor of preserving old books, some items simply do not belong on
the shelves of a public library. The blog “Awful Library Books” (www.awfullibrarybooks.net)
features examples of weeded library books from all types of libraries. In addition to laughs, it
provides solid evidence of the importance of weeding.
180

When I worked at the library in college, we decided to get rid of a room of Chemical
Abstracts. These documents were available online and very rarely circulated. To get rid of the
books, I spent a full week moving them down to our loading dock on a book truck and then
throwing them into the back of a pickup. They took up the entire bed of the pickup. This is a
significant amount of waste and a large amount of energy to expend to remove and recycle the
books. While there is no way around the necessity of getting rid of the books, the process should
be critically considered.
