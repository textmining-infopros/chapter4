MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY

ABSTRACT

•

This case study investigated the availability of 746 award-winning and honored titles, from eight
ethnic-specific children's literature awards in the branch libraries of the Allegheny County
Library Association (ACLA), and examined librarians' perceptions on the acquisition and use of
such literature. Findings suggest the collection development policies advocate for diverse library
collections, where practice does not always comply. Librarians usually choose books in favor of
the majority, continuing the inequality in the amount of children's books reflecting the dominant
population over the marginalized groups. Despite professed difficulty in the attainment and
circulation of multicultural children's literature, librarians agree more should be available and
promoted in their libraries. This study advocates increasing the education and training of
librarians in cultural competency and diversity because today' s library patrons are more
ethnically diverse and all children need to experience mirrors and windows in the books
available to them.

CHAPTER!

Children need windows and mirrors. They need mirrors in which they see themselves and
windows through which they see the world.
-Rudine Sims Bishop, Perspectives, 1990

Introduction

Attention on the demand for and lack of representation of diverse people in children's
literature has been on the rise. Both Multicultural Children's Book Day and the grassroots
organization We Need Diverse Books recently launched in 2014. "The attention they [the We
Need Diverse Books campaign] have brought to this issue has been phenomenal," (Horning,
Lindgren, & Schliesman, 2015). Within the past few years, publications like National Public

Radio, The Huffington Post, and Chicago Magazine have discussed the topic of multicultural
children's books. The New York Times also featured two pieces on the topic in their March 15,
2014 issue, one by multiple award-winning, including the Virginia Hamilton Award for Lifetime
Achievement, and best-selling children's book author, Walter Dean Myers. He revealed:
In 1969, when I first entered the world of writing children's literature, the field was
nearly empty. Children of color were not represented, nor were children from the lower
economic classes. Today, when about 40 percent of public school students nationwide are
black and Latino, the disparity of representation is even more egregious. (n.p.)
Historically, children of color rarely found themselves in the books they read. Larrick
(1965) affirmed that there were "6,340,000 non-white children learning to read and to understand
the American way of life in books which either omit them entirely or scarcelymention them" (p.
62). Larrick examined 5,206 children's books published from 1962-1964. She states, "Over the
three year period, only four-fifths of one percent of the children's trade books from the sixty2

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
three publishers tell a story about [African-Americans] today" (p. 64). Building on Larrick's
work, Rollock released an annotated bibliography, The Black Experience in Children's Books in
1979. Later, in 1984 Rollock published an updated version. Here she reported .
The volumes of material on the African American experience for children which were
available in the late 1960s and early 1970s has dwindled to a trickle of titles by the same
familiar authors. This social consciousness the Civil Rights Movement once aroused now
seems dormant and has receded to the passive quiet of the years prior to the 1960s (p.4).
In addition to mainstream publications, scholarly works increasingly focus on the lack of
diversity in children's literature today. The number of multicultural children's books being
published today is only slightly greater than the Larrick's seminal work from 1965 and Rollock' s
work in the 1984.

The Cooperative Children's Book Center (CCBC) at the University of

Wisconsin-Madison, conducted a survey of the 3,200 children's books published in 2013.
According to the CCBC, only 93 children's books published that year contained primary or
important secondary Black or African-American people. Factoring in nonfiction and children's
books including other minorities such as American Indian/Alaska Native, Latino, and
Asian/Pacific Islander, the number of books that include people of color climbs to a mere 253.
The CCBC (2015) will
count a book as "about" if the main character/subject is a person of color, or if we are
able to determine based on examining a book that a person of color features significantly
in the narrative. So a novel in which the main character is white will be included if we are
able to determine a secondary character of color is important in the story ("How we count
section", para. 2)

3

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
In 2014, the CCBC reported an increase in multicultural children's literature from previous

years. Out of 3,500 books published, 396 children's books were about people of color. In 2015,
the number increases again to 501 children's books about people of color. Martin (2004)
contends while only a small number of children's books published each year include cultural
diversity, they are more widely available than in the past. However, the number of books does
not seem to reflect the diversity of the students in today' s public schools in the United States.
Problem Statement

The overall number of students of color, those who identify as African-American or
Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, Latino, and Asian/Pacific Islander in public K-12
classrooms, now surpasses the number of students who identify as white. In 2015, the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES) displayed data that shows children of color now make up
50.8% of the K-12 public school population in the United States. This growth in ethnic diversity
of school age children holds strong implications for the community libraries that serve them.
In response to growing diversity of the U.S. population, the American Library
Association (ALA), recurrently updates its "Diversity in Collection Development: An
Interpretation of the Library Bill of Rights". The most recent amendments occurred on July 2,
2008 and on July 1, 2014 to officially encourage librarians to include materials that reflect the
wide variety of diverse perspectives. Specifically it states,
Library collections must represent the diversity of people and ideas in our society ...
Librarians have an obligation to select and support access to content on all subjects that
meet, as closely as possible, the needs, interests, and abilities of all persons in the
community the library serves. Librarians have a professional responsibility to be
inclusive in collection development (n.p.).

4

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Yet, according to Rawson (20 11) when librarians are adding books to collections they commonly
rely on preassembled title lists which are often insufficient in representing multicultural
diversity. Bishop (1990) asserts multicultural children's literature should be available to children
of color. Bishop further explains that children of color need to see themselves and their culture
reflected in the books and all children, children of color or not, need to learn about other cultures
in this increasingly diverse society. Similarly, Jansen (2015) states, "The goal of a public library
is not just to serve as a mirror for our community, but to serve as an open door to the world"
(n.p.). Kurz (2012) asserts few studies "have focused on the extent to which practicing librarians
are actually collecting multicultural books" for their collections (p. 6). Thus, the availability of
multicultural children's literature and collection development practices needs to be examined.
Purpose of the Study

Public libraries are a valuable resource for students, especially those who have limited
books at home, and for teachers, looking to supplement their classroom and school library's
collections. The purpose of this research is to conduct a case study regarding the availability of
ethnic-specific, award-winning multicultural children's literature in the branch libraries of the
Allegheny County Library Association (ACLA) and investigate the children's department
librarians' perceptions on the acquisition and use of such collections.

"A case study is an

empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon in depth and within its real-life
context" (Yin, 2009, p. 18). Additionally, this study will examine the collection development
policy documents of the libraries. This study may help librarians evaluate their children's book
collections as well as reflect on their collection attainment processes. Furthermore, this study
will add to literature by further understanding the availability of multicultural children's
literature in public libraries and the communities they serve.

5

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Significance of the Study

This study intends to contribute to the limited body of knowledge on the availability of
multicultural children's literature by searching for the amount of ethnic-specific, award-winning
and honored books, available in public libraries. "Today's libraries provide a wide range of
opportunities for people with diverse needs and interests" ("Joint Conference of Librarians of
Color", 2011, p. 94). Abdullahi (2007) believes that "a salient role of libraries is to promote a
more equitable and just society, and that diversity is worthy of affirmation" (p. 459). Yet,
Benton (20 15) contends an aperture exists "in the professional literature related to the
availability and accessibility of multicultural children's literature in public libraries" (p. 9). This
study will determine which ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored children's books are
available in the community libraries of the Allegheny County Library Association (ACLA)
system. This research will also illuminate the community race and income demographics each
library serves. Moreover, focus group interviews of the children's department librarians will
reflect on the collected data and discuss obstacles and opportunities that arise in collection
development. Asking local librarians to view the multicultural children's collections of ACLA
libraries, as well as the respective racial and income demographics of the libraries' service
regions, will allow the librarians to evaluate their collections and reflect on their collection
practices. This research may influence librarians and teachers to provide culturally inclusive
literature for their patrons and students as multicultural children's books are need for critical
pedagogy and multicultural education.

Because stereotyping, prejudice, and social biases

emerge in early childhood (Ausdale & Feagin, 2001, Bigler & Liben, 2007), it is imperative to
study the types of multicultural reading materials available to children elementary and pre-teen
students.

6

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Conceptual Framework

Critical Theory and Critical Race Theory (CRT) provide the theoretical foundation for
this study.

Critical race theory in education and culturally responsive teaching tenets also

underpin this study.

Multicultural children's books represent various races and ethnicities.

Librarians and teachers often have different backgrounds than of the students they serve. In
2010, according to the American Connnunity Survey Estimates Applied to Institute for Museum
and Library Services and National Center for Education Statistics Data, 85% of credentialed
public librarians were white. Delgado and Stefancic (2012) assert CRT in education explains
some of the inequities in resources for people of color and for those identifying as white.
Geneva Gay (2000) and Gloria Ladson-Billings (1998) build on the ideas proposed in CRT to
present culturally responsive teaching and to outline ways the instruction of teachers and
librarians can better meet the needs of students who are non-white. Using multicultural
children's literature is one.
Research Question

The purpose of this exploratory, qualitative case study is to first display the availability of
multicultural children's literature and the demographics of each library's connnunity and
secondly to describe librarians' perceptions on the collection and collection development
practices for the children's literature department.

The following research question will be

answered.
Given data on the amount of ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored multicultural
children's literature in the libraries of the Allegheny County Library Association and the
racial and income demographics of each library's connnunity, what challenges and
opportunities do local librarians perceive regarding the acquisition and use of such

7

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
collections?
Limitations and Delimitations

Some limitations and delimitations present themselves in this research. This study will
examine the holdings of specified children's books, award-winning and honored multicultural
children's books as defined in the next section of this chapter and described thoroughly in the
following chapter. Library collections can change daily because librarians continually add new
books and weed out older, rarely used, or damaged books. Though the neighborhoods and
communities the where the libraries are situated do vary, they are all located within Allegheny
County, thus generalization of the results of the study may be limited.
This research study will only search for ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored
books. It is probable other multicultural children's books that have not been awarded, exist in
the collections of the ACLA. Demarcating the ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored
books ensures that the multicultural authenticity and quality of each book are not questioned
because they are all chosen by special selection committees composed of children's literature
experts and other authorities of various racial backgrounds.
The researcher recognizes numerous intersectionalities of social identities exist, yet
research studies need boundaries. This study highlights race and income information rather than
all demographics of the libraries' varied communities. Limiting demographics is appropriate
because the researcher is inspecting ethnic-specific, award winning and honored children's books
at branch libraries in different neighborhoods of Allegheny County. These libraries have
different service populations. The libraries may also have varied collection sizes and budgets
possibly affected by its local community income. The librarian focus group interviews may

8

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
disclose information on how their budget and community median income may be related to their
children's literature collection.
Definitions

Award-winning. The present study will use winner and honor books from the following
eight literary awards- the Americas Award, the American Indian Youth Literature Award, the
Arab American Book Award, the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature, the Carter G.
Woodson Book Award, the Coretta Scott King Book Awards, the Pura Belpre Award, and the
Tomas Rivera Mexican American Children's Book Award.

Availability. For this study, availability indicates a book title owned by a library in print
or non-print form and able to be checked out by library patrons. This will be determined by the
presence or absence of the book in the library Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC).
Black. This term represents "persons with any black African lineage" and the ethnicity of

those students of color who identity as Black or African-American (Davis, n.d., para. 2).
Furthermore, this study will use a capital "B" emulating Mcintyre (1997) who states,
I use the upper case "B" for Black and the lower case "w" for white in reference
to racial identity because, as Harris (1993) argues both have "a particular political
history all the 'white' and 'Black have been defined oppositionally, they're not
functional opposites. 'White' had incorporated Black subordination; 'Black' is not
based on domination... 'Black' is naming that is part of counter hegemonic
practice" (p. 1710).

Children's literature. For the purposes of this study, children's literature includes books
written for audiences from birth through age 18; it includes both children's literature and young
adult literature, which often coincide depending on a child's reading ability, maturity, and

9

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
interests. Children's literature is widely used to describe literature for children from birth through
early adolescence (Short, Lynch-Brown, & Tomlinson, 2014). Young adult literature is written
for the approximate ages of twelve through nineteen (Cart, 2010). The literary awards used for
this study include books for children as well as books intended for young adults. This study is
focused on the honored and winners of certain ethnic-specific and multicultural awards, thus all
books that won the awards in this study will be included, whether they are intended for children
or for young adults.

Children (or people) of color. This umbrella term describes all children in the United
States who do not identify as white (Anglo) and/or children whom are not recognized as white by
the white community. This includes, American Indian, Asian-Pacific American, Black, Latino,
and multiracial children. Similarly, the terms people of color, person of color, and patrons of

color refer to adults and children from these groups. The researcher, like Ladson-Billings and
Donnor (2005) uses "these unitary racialized labels for political and cultural purposes.
Identification with the racialized labels means an acknowledgment of some of the common
experience group members have had as outsiders and others" (p. 284).

Critical theory. Jensen (1997) devised the following concise definition of critical
theory.
The Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School is a critique of capitalism, its appropriation
of the surplus value of the collective, and its commodification of every aspect of our
modern society. It provides a better understanding to present social conditions, how these
conditions evolved, how they are transformed, how they interact with each other, what
laws govern their transformation, and how they maintain their validity. This complex task
is achieved through a multi-discipline approach that combines perspectives drawn from

10

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
many different fields of study. (para. 1)
Critical race theory (CRT). A framework used to analyze inequalities in practices.

Delgado and Stephanie (2012) define CRT state the "critical race theory (CRT) movement is a
collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the relationship
among race, racism, and power" (p. 2). CRT "foregrounds race as the central construct for
analyzing inequality, and it offers educators and students alike with an alternative perspective in
identifYing more effective solutions to the challenges students of color face in school" (Zamudio,
Russell, Rios, & Bridgeman, 2011, p. 2).
Critical race theory in education. A framework used to analyze educational practices to

address the inequalities and implement a pedagogy that is culturally inclusive (Ladson-Billings
& Tate, 1995).

Cultural competence. As defined by Montiel-Overall (2009a) for the field of Library

Information Science, cultural competence is
the ability to recognize the significance of culture in one's own life and in the lives of
others; and to come to know and respect diverse cultural backgrounds and characteristics
through interaction with individuals from diverse linguistic, cultural and socioeconomic
groups; and to fully integrate the cultural of diverse groups into services work and
institutions in order to enhance the lives of both those being served by the library
profession and those engaged in service (p. 189-190).
Culturally responsive teaching. As defined by Gay (2000), culturally responsive teaching

is
using the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, frames of reference, and performance
styles of ethnically diverse students to make learning encounters more relevant to and

11

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
effective for them. It teaches to and through the strengths of these students. It is culturally
validating and affirming. (p. 29)
Ethnic. The researcher borrows Bhopal's (2004) definition of ethnicity, "a group a person
belongs to, and either identifies with or is identified with by others, as a result of a mix of
cultural and other factors including language, diet, religion, ancestry ... traditionaily associated
with race" (p. 443). In this study the term is used to describe and differentiate book awards.
Honored. This term describes committee-selected children's books which were highly
regarded and "honored", but not awarded "winner" status.
Librarian. This term describes a trained professional, typically with a degree in Library
Information Science, who is in charge of any specialized body of literature at a library.
Multicultural literature.

Multicultural literature has multiple definitions. As Short,

Lynch-Brown, and Tomlinson (2014) define it as
literature by and about groups that have been marginalized and disregarded by the
dominant European-American culture in the U.S. This definition includes racial, ethnic,
religious, and language minorities, those living with physical and mental disabilities, gays
and lesbians, and people living in poverty. (p. 218)
According to Callins (2006), multicultural literature focuses on people of color such as AfricanAmericans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanic Americans, or religious
minorities like Amish or Jewish, on regional cultures like Appalachian or Cajun, on the disabled,
and on the aged. For this paper, multicultural literature is that which incorporates peoples of
diverse, other than white, backgrounds defined by the previously mentioned awards.
Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC). The online database available to the public which
hosts the bibliography of a library's collection.

12

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Transitional books. Children's books defmed by Hughes-Hassell, Barkley, and Koehler

(2009) as "books recommended to support readers as they move from easy readers to more
complex chapter books" (p. 2).

factors that may influence children's library collection development. Information about the
multicultural book awards to be used in the study will be discussed. The ethnic-specific awards
incorporated into this study include American Indian Youth Literature Award, the Americas
Award, the Arab American Book Award, the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature, the
Carter G. Woodson Book Award, the Coretta Scott King Book Awards, the Pura Belpre Award,
and the Tomas Rivera Mexican American Children's Book Award.
Allegheny County Library Association will also be included.

An overview of the

include the multicultural literature in the surveyed libraries and the collected demographic data.
It will also identity patterns and themes that emerge from the collection development policies
and the librarian focus group interviews.
Chapter Five will complete the study with a discussion oflearning from the findings from
the research. Chapter Five will then offer implications from the study and suggestions for further
study. References, appendices, and tables will follow this chapter.
Summary

This introductory chapter discussed the nsmg public and scholarly interest in the
availability of multicultural children's literature. Krashen (2004), after exploring research on
voluntary reading as well as research on the role of public libraries, found that increases in the
diversity of the literature in library collections accessible to the patrons can result in increased
reading and reading enjoyment. Wood and Jocius contend (2013) "it is essential to make a
concerted effort to provide enough textual variety so that students can have the chance to see
themselves reflected in the books that are available in classroom and school libraries" (p.665).
Walker-Dalhouse (2008) asserts the body of research about multicultural literature is insufficient.
Thus, a need to evaluate the availability of multicultural children's literature, in the collections of
public libraries exists.
This study will investigate the availability of multicultural children's literature, as defined
earlier in this research paper, and as represented by winning and honored books of the Americas
Award, the American Indian Youth Literature Award, the Arab American Book Award, the
Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature, the Carter G. Woodson Book Award, the Caretta
Scott King Book Awards, the Pura Belpre Award, as well as the Tomas Rivera Mexican
American Children's Book Award, in the many public libraries of the Allegheny County Library

Association by searching the online public access catalog (OPAC). This study will view those
findings as well as the income and racial composition of the community in which the libraries are
located. Document analysis will be conducted on the collection development policies made
available by the libraries. Furthermore the librarians, who assist with the children's department
collection development, will be interviewed via focus groups. Critical theory and Critical Race
Theory (CRT) provide a lens through which the study will be conducted. The following chapter
will provide a comprehensive literature review related to the value of multicultural children's
literature, the importance of public libraries, and collection development factors. An overview of
each of the children's ethnic literature awards included in this study and of ACLA will be
discussed. The study's theoretical frameworks comprised of critical theory, Critical Race Theory,
Critical Race Theory in education and culturally responsive teaching will conclude Chapter Two.

Introduction

This study intends to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the availability of
multicultural children's literature in public libraries by answering the following question.
Given data on the amount of ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored multicultural
children's literature in selected libraries of the Allegheny County Library Association and
the racial and income demographics of each library's community, what challenges and
opportunities do local librarians perceive regarding the acquisition and use of such
collections?
Though statistics from the Cooperative Children's Book Center (CCBC) show there is little
multicultural literature being published for children, it does exists and it is out there. Can patrons
find it at their local libraries? This chapter reviews the pertinent literature as it relates to the need
to evaluate the availability of ethnic-specific, award-winuing and honored multicultural
children's literature in public libraries as well as librarian perceptions of the challenges and
opportunities regarding multicultural children's book collections. Presented here is an extensive
look into the value of multicultural children's literature, the importance of public libraries and
issues affecting libraries' collection development. Because this study demarcates multicultural
children's literature by using ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored books and libraries
within Allegheny County, information regarding the ethnic-specific children's literature awards
as well as some information on the Allegheny County Library Association (ACLA) is included.
Concluding the literature review is a discussion regarding Critical theory, Critical Race Theory

16

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
(CRT) and Critical Race Theory in education and culturally responsive teaching, the frameworks
from which this study will be conducted.
The Value of Multicultural Literature

Multicultural children's literature is a medium for understanding oneself and one's world
and offers "affirmation, visibility, and insight into the world in which they live" (Homing,
Ligren, & Schliesman, 2014 n.p.). Because "children seek to understand and interpret racial
differences" (University of Pittsburgh School of Education Race and Early Childhood
Collaborative, 2016, p. 1), it is important that children's books reflect the diversity that exists in
societies today.

Multicultural children's literature presents diversity to which children can

connect and affirm both cultural and social identities. Multicultural children's literature also
grants children opportunities to learn about others who are different. Rudine Sims Bishop (1990)
coined the metaphor equating literature to mirrors, windows, and sliding glass doors.

This

metaphor is found throughout the scholarly and general literature and will be discussed here.
Bishop (1990) asserts children's literature should depict diversity of people and
experiences and claims children's literature can provide readers the chance to see themselves and
their culture reflected in the stories they read. Colby and Lyon (2004) state, "Students need to be
able to make connections between literature and their everyday lives" (p. 24). This type of
exposure at an early age validates children and their place in the world. Multicultural books are
tools that can assist in forming identities when children find themselves reflected in books
(Bishop, 2007, 1997). Like looking in a mirror, students of color feel recognized and understood
when their culture is acknowledged (Boles, 2006). The scholarly literature shows the children
agree.
Hefflin (2003) illuminates how children feel about books m her work presenting

17

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
interviews of four African-American third-graders. As Hefflin reported, one student said, "I
mostly always see White people and animals in books" (p. 176). When the students did read
books about African-Americans, the readers zealously shared the stories with their friends and
family (Hefflin, 2003). In an additional article suggesting guidelines for the use of AfricanAmerican literature, Hefflin and Barksdale-Ladd (2001), recount another African-American
student expressing how she appreciated "seeing people in the book that are my same color. I like
seeing black people in books because mostly they have white people in commercials and
shows ... you don't see a lot of books that have black people" (p. 811). Reimer (1992) began her
report on multiethnic literature with a telling student quote, '"Just look around this library. You
don't ever see books about kids like us.' (African-American fifth grade girl)" (p. 2). More
recently, Barry (2013) reports similar sentiments from the students in her study. One student
who identified as Hispanic asked, "Why can't they ever have books relating to me?" and an
African-American student added it was "harder to find [stories] about people of my race" (p.
360). Glasgow (2004) discussing Appalachian culture and its representation in youth literature
expands, "They need to be able to identify with the subject matter and recognize themselves in
the fictional characters" (p. 64). Additionally, Barry (2013) reports that 67% of the Hispanic
females and 88% of the African-American females from her study wanted more ethnic-specific
reading material.
Grace Lin (2016), award-winning children's and young adult author and artist asks, "A
book can show you the world, but it can also show you a reflection of yourself. But what
happens if you never see anyone in a book that looks like you?" (n.p). She then explains
There was nobody that looked like me in school. There was nobody looked like me in the
movies. There was nobody that looked like me on TV, or in the magazines. And most

18

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
importantly, there was nobody that looked like me in the books that I loved. In fact, the
only book I ever saw with an Asian person in it was this one [show The Five Chinese
Brothers]. . .. I felt like I was nobody ... I felt like I could never be anyone important ...
Gangi (2008) corresponds these findings in her work.

She investigates "literacy

textbooks and professional books- along with, awards, school book fairs andDbook order
forms, and children'sDliterature textbooks" and finds they "marginalizeD children of color" (p.
30). She explains, "Lack of equity in representation places an unbearable burden on children of
color" (p. 30).

Wood and Jocius (2013) concur. They advocate for critical literacy for young

black males by using "culturally relevant texts, collaboration, and critical conversations" (p.661 ).
Wood and Jocius (2013) assert "it is essential to make a concerted effort to provide enough
textual variety so that students can have the chance to see themselves reflected in the books that
are available in classroom and school libraries" (p. 665).
Celebrated and award-winning children's book authors like Walter Dean Myers and
Sharon Flake also contend that children need to read and have access to multicultural books that
accurately reflect their own ethnic and cultural background. Myers (2014) reflects how children
who read his stories "have been struck by the recognition of themselves in the story, a validation
of their existence as human beings" (para.! 0). Similarly, Flake (2007) discusses her experience:
One reason I believe these boys gobble up such books is because finally someone is
telling their story, or that of people who look like them and live where they live. . .. we've
got to give them books that remind them of home-of who they are. When this happens,
they fly through books-even the most challenged readers. (p. 14)

19

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Multicultural children's literature, like a mirror can reflect culture and help children identify with
their culture. Like a window, multicultural literature allows children to peer through and view
other cultures.
Seeing different cultures develops an understanding of experiences of those with whom
we interact. Desai (2011) states, "Children's literature is a transparent window on the future- a
way to glimpse how the literary imagination constructs cultural value" (p. 42). Bishop (1990)
asserts the opportunity to learn about people from other cultures and people who have life
experiences that are unfamiliar to the reader lies within multicultural literature.
The University of Pittsburgh School of Education Race and Early Childhood
Collaborative (2016) found "young children are thinking about race" (p.9). Accordingly, having
multicultural resources is especially beneficial for young students because this is when they are
beginning to form their cultural viewpoints and their prejudices (Mosely, 2010). Moreover,
"Multicultural children's literature can affirm cultural and social identities" (Crowley, Fountain,
& Torres, 2012, p. 28). "For children who are white, these books offer different perspectives

from their world" (Boyd, Causey, & Gaida, 2015, p. 380). Yokota (1993) advises the best way to
introduce children to the value of different cultures is through fiction, where "cultural
information can be present in virtually every aspect... [and] naturally and truthfully woven into
the story" (p.l56). "Young children of color need supports to develop positive racial identities"
(University of Pittsburgh School of Education Race and Early Childhood Collaborative, 2016,
p.9). Hefflin and Barksdale-Ladd (2001) concur, "Literature is a powerful medium. Through it,
children construct messages about their culture and roles in society" (p. 81 0).

This helps

children develop empathy towards peers and nurture meaningful relationships in classrooms and
playgrounds. Multicultural children's literature can promote acceptance of individual differences

20

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
and increases a child's awareness and knowledge about the world (Agosto, 2007). Lu (1998)
contents multicultural literature allows children to value unique qualities of other ethnic groups,
eliminates cultural ethnocentrism, and develops multiple perspectives. Hall (2008) affirms that
"carefully selecting what we read aloud and place in classroom libraries, . . . [can foster]
children's literacy development, empathy, and acceptance of themselves and others" (p. 8).
Likewise, Hall's statement translates to public library collections and storytimes.
A children's literature collection that includes people of different ethnicities presents a
more realistic picture to a child. Data displayed in 2015 by The National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) states children of color now make up 50.8% of the K-12 public school
population in the United States. Gay (2010) states,"
The ethnic, racial, cultural, social, and linguistic diversity that is growing by leaps and
bounds in U.S. schools and society is a defining feature of our lives, even though we
often try to deny its existence or minimize its significance" (p. 143).
The increasingly diverse population is evident in U.S. classrooms. The availability of
multicultural children's literature should represent the same diversity (Naido, 2014). Moreover,
Estrin (20 15) states "there is wide agreement that children of all backgrounds will benefit from
bonding with characters of diverse races, ethnicities, religions ... " (n.p.).
Quality multicultural children's books can dispel misconceptions and break stereotypes
associated with a specific culture. University of Pittsburgh School of Education Race and Early
Childhood Collaborative (20 16) state, "racial identity for young African American children is an
urgent concern and more resources are needed" (p. 2). Yokota (1993) contends multicultural
literature "provides [children with] vicarious experiences from cultures other than their
own .. .influencing their decisions about how they will live in this culturally pluralistic world"

21

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
(p.156). Dowd (1992) also maintains "...from reading, hearing, and using culturally diverse
materials, young people learn that beneath surface differences of color, culture or ethnicity, all
people experience universal feelings of love, sadness, self-worth, justice and kindness" (p. 220).
Beaty (1996) argues how "Teachers should consider those races, ethnicities, and cultures that are
not represented in their classrooms and offer children's books that depict the world 'outside' so
children can see a more global picture" (as cited in Hall, 2008, p. 83 ). Some authors of color
have had to convince teachers and librarians that their books are not just for children of color, but
can be appreciated by everyone, including white children (Harris, 1991 ).
Though there is much value in multicultural children's books, diversity in the literature is
lacking. Each year the Cooperative Children's Book Center (CCBC) studies and reports the
diversity represented in children's books. The CCBC reported an increase in 2015 in the
publication of multicultural children's books.

Specifically, of the 3,400 children's books

published in 2015, only 265 books were about Africans/African-Americans yet this is an increase
from 2014 which had 180. The number of books representing Asian Pacifies/Asian Pacific
Americans totaled 112. A mere 42 were about American Indian/ First Nations and 82 of the
3,400 children's books published in 2015 were about Latinos. Thus, out of the 3,500 children's
books published in 2015, only 501 were about people of color, 14.7%. This is an increase from
2014, the total amount of books about people of color was 396, 11.3%. Table 1 highlights the
CCBC results.

Additionally, McGowan, (2015) reports on an examined 455 children's picture books published
in 2012 and found 75% of the main characters were white.

Multicultural books are needed to

supplement the "unbearable whiteness" in classroom literacy instruction in the United States
(Gangi, 2008).
Ullucci (20 10) maintains "the assumption that multicultural education and racially
conscious teachers benefit children of color" (p 130).

An educator's lack of background,

awareness, and preparation to be culturally competent, can prevent the choosing and providing of
appropriate literary materials. Additionally, Hughes-Hassell, Barkley, and Koehler (2009) found
that the underrepresentation of people of color implies racism, perhaps subconscious, but racism
nonetheless. University of Pittsburgh School of Education Race and Early Childhood
Collaborative (20 16) assert young children of color the experience "daily messages, explicit or
subtle, from individuals or institutions: you are not as good, not as lovable, not as beautiful, and
not as smart as the dominant race" (p. 1). Teachers need awareness first, then preparation to
begin to correct the constraints due to lack of culturally inclusive books. Benton (20 15) declares,
"All children can benefit from reading about people from other cultures and ethnicities, and the
public library is an important resource for finding such literature" (p. 40).

23

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Importance of Public Libraries

Public libraries are valuable in many ways. Abdullahi (2007) believes that "a salient role
of libraries is to promote a more equitable and just society, and that diversity is worthy of
affirmation" (p. 459). According to Tumuhairwe (2013), "the world today needs culturally
competent institutions which are able to provide cultural competence guidelines within the
library and information science/studies (LIS) profession for purposes of promotion and
development of collections for less privileged groups of people" (p.1 ).
Libraries are an essential source for a wide variety of reading material (Krashen, 2011 ).
Gray (2009) noted that African-American students did not have many culturally relevant books
available to them at school. Many teachers supplement their curriculum and classroom and
school libraries with materials from local public libraries (Gray, 2009).

Krashen (2013) says,

"the necessary condition for encouraging reading is access to reading material" (p. 21 ).

Feger

(2006) found the use of culturally relevant literature was linked to increased students' motivation
to read. "The more I had incorporated culturally relevant literature and non-fiction into the
curriculum, the more my students' engagement in reading had increased" (p. 18). Additionally,
Whitehead (2004) investigated the effects of students' access to print through public library card
ownership and found "the students who had library cards and that visited their community library
outperformed students who did not" (p. 165); they outperformed the others in reading
performance and attitudes. Because reading is connected to academic success (Krashen, 2004),
and because many students and teachers use public libraries, children's multicultural literature
for children should be available in public libraries (Garrison, 2012; Kurz, 2012).
Many students lack access to books at home or even in school which makes public
libraries a significant source of reading material for many (Krashen, 1995, 2004, 2011;

24

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Whitehead, 2004). Additionally, Horrigan (2015) reports the majority of the public, 78%,
"believe that libraries are effective at promoting literacy and love of reading" (Horrigan, n.p.).
Public libraries provide vital services to communities (Ly, 2010; Horrigan, 2013). They offer
more than book borrowing; libraries offer numerous free resources like internet and computer
access, meeting spaces, varied programs and events, and children's literacy programs. Plus,
public libraries are important to residents oflow-income communities (Ly, 2010). Additionally,
"Low-income Americans, Hispanics and African-Americans are more likely than others to say
that a library closing would impact their lives and communities (Horrigan, 2015, n.p).
Furthermore, snrveys have shown that patrons and community residents find that public
libraries improve quality of life and are a good use of tax revenue. 95% of Americans ages 16
and older agree that the materials and resources available at public libraries play an important
role in giving everyone a chance to succeed" (Horrigan, 2015, n.p.). The Pew Research Center
(2013) reports:
Americans strongly value the role of public libraries in their communities, both for
providing access to materials and resources and for promoting literacy and improving the
overall quality of life. Most Americans say they have only had positive experiences at
public libraries, and value a range of library resources and services (Zicknhr, Rainie,
Purcell, & Duggan, para. 1)
The American Library Association (20 15) communicates that despite the public popularity of
libraries, many are facing "funding challenges" (p. 10) and taut budgets which negatively
impacts the development of literature collections in libraries. The County-City Library Service
Panel, comprised of representatives appointed by the boards of the Allegheny County Library
Association (ACLA) and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh concur with the ALA. In 2014, a

25

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
report on Allegheny County Library services states, "The public library still matters greatly in
the 21st Century. Demand for the free and varied services libraries provide continues to grow in
spite of a constant struggle to sustain financial support from government and other sources"
(County-City Library Service Panel, p.l ).
Issues Affecting Collections

There are many issues that affect library collections; budget cuts are one. Most libraries
are familiar with decreasing budgets and funding issues (Schmidt, 2004). Most librarians are all
too familiar with how that deficit can influence collection development (Rodrigues, 2006;
Tjournas, 1993). In times of economic distress, decreased library funding and low budgets often
occur (Schmidt, 2004). Confounding this issue is that public library usage rises as the economy
declines (RooneyDBrowne, 2009). The literature shows other factors besides shrinking budgets
that can influence a public library's collections.
Librarian bias and lack of awareness or lack of cultural competence may also be an issue.
For the field of Library Information Science (LIS), Montiel-Overall (2009a) defines cultural
competence as
the ability to recognize the significance of culture in one's own life and in the lives of
others; and to come to know and respect diverse cultural backgrounds and characteristics
through interaction with individuals from diverse linguistic, cultural and socioeconomic
groups; and to fully integrate the cultural of diverse groups into services work and
institutions in order to enhance the lives of both those being served by the library
profession and those engaged in service. (p. 189-190)
Montiel-Overall (2009b) declares, "understanding how to provide services to diverse groups is a
major challenge facing 21st century librarians" (p.l). Additionally, Garrison (2012) reports that

26

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
some of the librarians in her study admit that they do not purchase certain multicultural books for
their libraries because there are no residents of that cultural group in their community, or if there
are, they do not come into the library. Montiel-Overall (2009a), discussing cultural competence
for libririans, contends that a "greater understanding of cultural issues will result in increased
library use" (p. 176).

Moreover, other studies suggest that teachers, either consciously or

unconsciously, may not be inclined to use culturally authentic multicultural books (Jipson &
Paley, 1991; Wollman-Bonilla, 1998).
A librarian's job includes many responsibilities; one of the most substantial is collection
development. Considering the needs of the library patrons has been an important part of
collection development since the early 1900s (Schmidt, 2004). Because librarians could not read
every single book published, some use prefabricated resources such as review journals, vendors,
and award lists to assist in building their collections. According to Garrison's (2012) review of
the literature, librarians draw from resources such as review journals and award lists to make
informed decisions of book titles when choosing materials for their collections. Hoffert (2007)
found librarians often use vendors to assist with book selections.
Rawson (20 11) asserts when librarians are adding books to their library collections, they
frequently rely on preassembled title lists which are insufficient in representing of multicultural
diversity. Gangi (2008) cautions this method and asserts the Caldecott and the Newbery award
lists:
guarantee any author or illustrator a lifetime revenue stream, as virtually all libraries
purchase the winning titles, they are displayed in most bookstores, and teachers rely
heavily on them.

In a society as pluralistic as ours, this automatic reliance on the

Newberys and Caldecotts should be questioned because the "committees that decide on

27

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
the Newberys and Caldecotts are made up of librarians who, like teachers, are mostly
White and middle class and, therefore, more likely to choose books that resonate with
them. (p. 31)
Teachers, students, families, and the general public should be able to find quality multicultural .
children's literature at their local public library.
Landt (2013) cautions that "Not every piece of literature featuring multicultural
characters is an appropriate choice" (p.4) Generalizations and stereotypes can be common as
authors try to reflect individuals within varied cultural groups and it can be difficult for a person
of an outside culture to evaluate them (Guevara
, 2003). Therefore, this study focuses on ethnic specific, award-winning and honored books.
Each award has a committee comprised of varied experts who evaluate the contending books for
authenticity and quality.
Literature Awards

There are numerous literary awards that honor the authors and illustrators of exemplary
children's books. Gangi (2008) asserts that the Caldecott Medal and the Newbery Medal "are
the most prestigious... [because] virtually all libraries purchase the winning titles, they are
displayed in most bookstores, and teachers rely heavily on them" (n.p). Yet, the Caldecott and
Newbery awards are excluded in this study. Gary (1984) found negative African-American
stereotypes in Newbery Medal and Caldecott Award books published between the years 1963
and 1983. "While excellent books that reflect diversity can certainly be found among the ranks
of the Newbery and Caldecott winners and honor books" (Boyd, Causey, & Gaida, p. 381, 2015),
Oberdick (2009) suggests "that the most recent Caldecott Award and Honor books do not display
a variety of races and cultures thus making the books as a whole not very multicultural" (p. 49).

28

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Though the Caldecott Medal and the Newbery Medal are the most recognized awards, they are
not culturally or etlmic-specific. This study seeks to find the availability of multicultural
children's books in public libraries, thus literary awards that honor specifically etlmicity or
etlmic groups will be used.
Portrayals of characters and cultures in quality multicultural literature need to be
authentic and accurate (Harris, 1991; Yokota 1993). Yokota (1993) explains "cultural accuracy
means that issues are represented in ways that reflect the values and beliefs of the culture.
Cultural information included within a book's pages can help readers gain a 'true sense of the
culture" (p. 159). Kiefer (20 10) states
teachers and librarians need to read and evaluate books in ways that are reflective of
sensibilities toward many diverse lived experiences. To be sensitive to matters that are
offensive or hurtful to different cultural groups is not enough. It is imperative that we
understand how a text and/or illustrations can lead to the creation of reinforcement of
stereotypes and how those stereotypes then become fodder for personal and institutional
manifestations of racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, ableism, or anti-Semitism. (p.
73)
Utilizing ethnic-specific children's literature awards is an effective way to identify quality
multicultural children's books (Garrison, 2012; Kiefer, 2010; Kurz, 2012; Short, Lynch-Brown,
& Tomlinson, 2014). Boyd, Causey, and Gaida (2015) confirm, "Award-winning books have

been considered by experts and judged for cultural authenticity and accuracy, among other
determinants of quality" (p. 382). Each award described below utilizes specified criteria
delineated by a selective committee to ensure accuracy and authenticity.
This study focuses on award winners and books listed as honored or honorable mentions

29

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
of specific ethnic-awards including the American Indian Youth Literature Award, the Americas
Award, the Asian/Pacific American Youth Literature Award, Coretta Scott King Book Award,
Pura Belpre Award, and the Tomas Rivera Mexican American Children's Book Award. In order
to include representation of non-fiction children's books and because of its overall multicultural
value, the Carter G. Woodson Book Award, though not specific to one ethnicity, will also be
included in this study. This next section briefly describes each award.
American Indian Youth Literature Award. In 2006, the American Indian Library

Association (AILA), founded the American Indian Youth Literature Award (AIYLA), an
affiliate of the American Library Association (ALA), "as a way to identifY and honor the very
best writing and illustrations by and about American Indians" (American Indian Library
Association, para. 1). Although the AILA is affiliate of the ALA, its award, the AIYLA, is not
listed among the other awards on the ALA website. Presented every two years, in three
categories- picture book, middle school, and young adult, the awards "identifY and honor the
very best writing and illustrations by and about American Indians" (American Indian Youth
Literature Award, p. 1). The criteria described by the American Indian Library Association
states the winning books "will present American Indians in the fullness of their humanity in the
present and past contexts" (American Indian Library Association, para. 1).
The Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature. The Consortium of

Latin American Studies Program, (CLASP) started the Americas Award in 1993 in order "to
encourage and commend authors, illustrators and publishers who produce quality children's and
young adult books that portray Latin America, the Caribbean, or Latinos in the United States,
and to provide teachers with recommendations for classroom use" (Americas Award, para. 1).
CLASP presents up to two arroual book awards, which may be fiction, folklore, non-fiction, or

30

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
poetry as well as a commended list of titles (Americas Award, n.d.). Any the children's and
young adult literature fiction or nonfiction winners and honorees will be included in this study.

The Arab American Book Award. According to its mission statement, "The Arab
American Book Award is a literary program created to honor books written by and about Arab
Americans. The program generates greater awareness of Arab American scholarship and writing
through an annual award competition and educational outreach" (Arab American National
Museum, "About the Arab American Book Award", n.d.) Created in 2007, this is the newest
award included in this study. The Arab American Book Award committee includes previous
winners, librarians, and Arab American scholars who review book submissions and decide on the
winners and honorees (Arab American National Museum, "About the Arab American Book
Award", n.d.).

The Asian/Pacific American Youth Literature Award. "The Asian/Pacific American
Librarians Association (APALA) was established at the 1980 American Library Association
(ALA) Annual Conference in New York. It was incorporated ... in 1981 and initiated affiliation
with the ALA in 1982" (Yamashita, 2000, p. 88). APALA founded the Asian/Pacific American
Award for Literature. This literary award was established in 2001 during the first conference
with the Chinese American Librarians Association. This award aims "to honor and recognize
individual work about Asian/Pacific Americans and their heritage, based on literary and artistic
merit" (Awards, para. 1). The Asian/Pacific American Youth Literature Award allows five
categories of awards: adult fiction; adult nonfiction; children's literature; young adult literature;
and picture books. (Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association, 2011). Only the children's
literature, young adult literature and picture books categories will be included in this study.

The Carter G. Woodson Book Award. The National Council for the Social Studies

31

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
(NCSS) founded the Carter G. Woodson Book Award in 1974 because "there was a paucity of
books relating to racial and ethnic minorities. In addition, authors and publishers of such books
rarely received the recognition that their efforts merited" (para. 2). The award is presented to:
the most distinguished social science books appropriate for young readers that depict
ethnicity in the United States. Sponsored by the National Council for the Social Studies,
the national professional organization for social studies educators. The purpose of this
award is to encourage the writing, publishing, and dissemination of outstanding social
science books for young readers that treat topics related to ethnic minorities and [race]
relations sensitively and accurately. Books relating to ethnic minorities and the authors of
such books rarely receive the recognition they merit from professional organizations.
(National Council for the Social Studies, About the Carter G. Woodson Book Award,
para. l)D
While this award is not ethnic-specific, it is included for it's multicultural value and nonfiction
representation.
The Coretta Scott King Book Award. In 1969, a discussion regarding the absence of any
African-Americans to win the Newbery Award or the Caldecott award, prompted the creation of
the Coretta Scott King Book Award, making it the oldest ethnic-specific youth literature award
in the United States (Smith, 2009; Yokota, 2011). The first Coretta Scott King Award was
issued in 1970. An illustrator category was added to the award in 1974. Later, the John Steptoe
Award for New Talent was added in 1995 "to recognize exceptional work from new AfricanAmerican authors and illustrators" (The history of the Coretta Scott King book awards, para. 6).
Winners and honorees from both are included in this study for the the Coretta Scott King
Awards.

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY

The Pura Belpre Award. Founded in 1996, the Pura Belpre Award is named after Pura
Belpre, the first Latina librarian at the New York Public Library. The is presented "to a Latino
writer and to a Latino illustrator whose work best portrays, affirms and celebrates the Latino
cultural experience in an outstanding work of literature for children." (About the Pura Belpre
Award, para. 1). The Pura Belpre Award is "co-sponsored by the Association for Library
Service to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library Association (ALA), and
REFORMA, the National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos
and the Spanish-Speaking, an ALA affiliate." (About the Pura Belpre Award, para. 1).

The Tomas Rivera Mexican American Children's Book Award. The Texas State
University College of Education created the Tomas Rivera Mexican American Children's Book
Award. The award was created in 1995 "to honor authors and illustrators who create literature
that depicts the Mexican American experience" (Rivera Book Award, para.!). Given annually to
the author/illustrator of the most distinguished book "written for children and young adults (0-16
years)" (Criteria & Timeline, para.!), that authentically reflects the lives and experiences of
Mexican Americans in the United States" (Criteria & Timeline, para.2).
The youth literature awards described above include a myriad of ethnic diversity. They
offer a reliable way for teachers, librarians, and the general public to find high quality literature
for children and young adults (Kiefer, 2010; Short, Lynch-Brown, & Tomlinson, 2014; Yokota,
2011).

Thus, ethnic-specific, award-winning, multicultural children's books, an important

resource, should be available in public libraries like the members of the Allegheny County
Library Association.

ACLA
In 1991, "A Quiet Crisis: Libraries in Allegheny County" was published detailing the

33

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
state of the public libraries located within Allegheny County. At that time, each library was
working independently of one another. This was inefficient as some libraries lacked funding and
left many citizens without access to public library services (Lucchino, 1991 ). The report, by
Lucchino (1991) states, "Libraries and their supporters must unite" (p. 43) to improve services
and increase funding. Support from the community was raised and a centralized coordination
and communication structure was required. The Allegheny County Library Association (ACLA)
was established, becoming a corporation in 1994. "ACLA has succeeded in becoming a model
for delivering service across 130 municipal boundaries" (Who We Are, n.p.).
"Through its coordination, ACLA expands the resources of local libraries beyond what
they could accomplish individually" (Who We Are, n.p.).

Though each library is managed

independently and has separate boards of directors, the libraries now collaborate and support
each other to work more efficiently. They share books, ebooks, and a technology infrastructure
sustained by the eiNetwork. This network allows patrons to use the interlibrary loan service to
request and receive books from other ACLA locations.
Examining the holdings of ACLA libraries and their collection development policies, and
exploring what challenges and opportunities librarians perceive regarding the acquisition and use
of their multicultural children's collection, intends to contribute to the dearth of knowledge on
the availability of multicultural children's literature in public libraries. The theoretical
frameworks underpinning this study further support its value.
Critical Theory
Critical theory is a philosophy that involves being critical of the established views of
society, which means examining beliefs that might favor privileged people. Creswell (2014)
citing Fay (1987) explains how "critical theory perspectives are concerned with empowering

34

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
human beings to transcend the constraints placed on them by race, class, and gender" (p. 65).
Critical theory was developed by a group of scholars deemed, the Frankfurt School in the
years surrounding World War II (Butin, 2010) and has a rich history. The inaugural critical
theorist, Max Horkheimer, believed a capitalist society could only be transformed by becoming
more democratic, because "all conditions of social life that are controllable by human beings
depend on real consensus" (Horkheimer, 1972, p. 249-250). Agger (1991) agrees and suggests
"capitalism deepens false consciousness suggesting to people that the existing social system is
both inevitable and rational." (p.l 08).
Critical theory provides a specific interpretation of Marxist philosophy and addresses the
relationships among education, culture, society, and economy. Leckie, Given, and Buschman
(201 0) contend, "LIS is interested (in one way or another) in how society, people, institutions,

(including but not limited to libraries) governments, and information technologies work, and the
interactions among them" (xiii). Thus, Benoit (2007) offers critical theory as a model to evaluate
Library Information Science (LIS).
Furthermore, library information science is also very interested in the betterment of
society, from the development of national information policies, to the provision of userfriendly and equitable access to information, the inclusion of diverse and/or marginalize
clienteles, the support of citizen lifelong learning, the nurturing of the library in the
community, and many other proactive areas of research and practice. (Leckie, Given &
Buschman, 2010, xiii)
Critical Race Theory

Larrick's 1965 landmark study, "The All-White World of Children's Books' and the
1985 premier annual investigation by the Cooperative Children's Book Center demonstrate that

35

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
diversity, or lack of diversity, in children's literature has been a topic of interest for decades.
The statistics from the Cooperative Children's Book Center (CCBC) display how the majority of
children's literature is still predominately about white people. Students' reading choices
advantage white children and exclude children of color because children of color are underrepresented (Gangi 2008, Hughes-Hassell, Barkley, & Koehler, 2009). Thus, race becomes a
factor when looking for children's literature.
Critical Race Theory (CRT) according to Yosso (2005), "is a framework that can be used
to theorize, examine and challenge the ways race and racism implicitly and explicitly impact on
social structures, practices and discourses (p. 70). Critical Race Theory (CRT) analyzes the role
of race and racism in perpetuating social disparities between dominant and marginalized racial
groups (DeCuir & Dixson 2004; Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995). Delgado and Stefancic (2012)
assert CRT in education explains some of the inequities in resources for people of color and
those identifying as white.

Critical Race theorists concur that racism is engrained in the

structures of various American systems (Delgado and Stefancic, 2012; Ladson-Billings & Tate,
1995). Zamudio, Russell, Rios, & Bridgeman (2011) affirm, CRT proposes a "race-conscious
approach to understanding educational inequality and identifying potential solutions" (p. 2).
Critical Race Theory first appeared in the literature after the Civil Rights movement. As
Yosso states (2005) "CRT scholarship focused its critique on the slow pace and unrealized
promise of Civil Rights legislation." (p.72). The sluggishness of racial reform became apparent
to scholars, Derrick Bell, Alan Freeman and Richard Delgado who explored the hegemony and
developed the underlying tenets that would later become Critical Race Theory (Delgado &
Stefancic, 1993, 2012; Ladson-Billings, 1998). Delgado & Stefancic (2012) explain CRT as a
movement and:

36

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
a collection of activists and scholars interested in studying and transforming the
relationship among race, racism, and power. The movement considers many of the
same issues that conventional civil rights and ethnic studies discourses take up, but
places them in a broader perspective that includes economics, history, context, groupand self-interest, and even feelings and the unconscious. Unlike traditional civil rights,
which embraces incrementalism and step-by-step progress, critical race theory
questions the very foundations of the liberal order. (p. 2)
In addition, Glenn, (2002) contends that though American citizenship has been idealized as
universal and inclusive, it has been used to create boundaries of inclusion and exclusion,
excluding large groups of people in practice. Examining races and regions during 1870-1930 in
the United States with large non-white populations, such as "African Americans in the South,
Mexican Americans in the Southwest, and Asian Americans in Hawaii" (p. 16), Glenn, (2002)
noticed "how U.S. citizenship and labor systems affected these three groups and how the groups
struggled against exclusion and oppression" (p. 16).
Crenshaw (1995) contends that CRT demonstrates how "deeply the Issues of racial
ideology and power continue to matter in American life" (p. xxxii.) Crenshaw also notes that
CRT scholars sought to explain the inequitable social structures that were created to maintain the
subordination of people of color and the supremacy of those in power. Additionally, Glenn
(2002) declares "a central feature of the U.S. economy has been its reliance on racialized and
gendered systems of control" (p. 5). Delgado and Stefancic (2012), further explicate that CRT
elucidates the hierarchical system which favors whites and results in unequal ways of living for
minorities and results in racism described as "the common, everyday experience of most people
of color in this country" (p. 7).

37

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Later, educational scholars sought to apply Critical Race Theory in order to understand
inequities in schools such as "controversies over curriculum and history" (Delgado & Stefancic,
2012, p. 7). The Critical Race Theory in Education movement had begun.

Critical Race Theory in education. Gloria Ladson-Billings and William F. Tate
"were discouraged with the educational literature that presented race as either merely an
ideological construct or an objective condition" (Zamudio, eta!, p.7). Ladson-Billings and Tate
(1995) amalgamated scholars' work on Critical Race Theory in the legal realm and utilized it to
examine issues present in the field of education.
Zamudio et a!. (20 10) confirm the "CRT in education movement mirrors the earlier
movement with Critical Legal Studies to develop an analysis that places race at the center of the
problem of inequality" (p. 8). Critical Race in education theorists "see contemporary racial
inequality as an outgrowth of a history of oppression" (Zamudio eta!., 2010, p. 4). Critical Race
Theory in education provides a framework to examine such oppression by analyzing educational
practice addressing the inequalities and implementing a pedagogy that is culturally inclusive and
responsive (Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995). Mellor (2013) states
Critical theories of education are philosophical, political, and pedagogic responses to real
world circumstances, which attempt to shift the purposes, scope, aims, and delivery of
education to enable cultural and social transformation through the progressive growth of
individuals. (p.l64)
CRT educators work towards expanding truths to include the history and experiences of people
of color (Zamudio eta!., 2010). "One of the greatest contributions of CRT is its emphasis on
narratives and counterstories told from the vantage point of the oppressed ... retelling history from
a minority perspective" (Zamudio et a!., 2010, p. 5)

38

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Librarians and teachers often come from backgrounds that are different from the children
they serve. In 2010, according to the American Community Survey Estimates Applied to
Institute for Museum and Library Services and National Center for Education Statistics Data,
85% of credentialed librarians were white. In 2011, according to the statistics provided by the
National Center for Education Information, 84% of the nation's teachers were white. Thus,
getting to know and considering the historical and cultural backgrounds of the students they
serve, becomes essential for librarians and teachers to reach diverse learners. (Tidwell &
Thompson, 2008). Critical race theory claims that race is a lens through which the education of
diverse students should be viewed (Ladson-Billings & Tate, 1995).

Zamudio et al. (2010)

declare "CRT [Critical Race Theory] is the medicine for education" (p. 6). Kurz (2015) reminds
us, "Many of these educational areas are tied to LIS (Library Information Science) in the form of
public funding, provision of services to communities of color, the lack of diversity in the
profession and the collection development of multicultural materials" (p. 33). Consequently,
critical race theory in education and the principles of culturally responsive teaching apply to
librarians and the books and services they provide to their child patrons.

Culturally responsive teaching. Gay's (2000) research findings, theoretical claims,
practical experiences, and personal stories of educators researching and working with
underachieving African, Asian, Latino, and Native American students assisted her in establishing
culturally responsive teaching. Culturally responsive teaching, as described by Gay (2002), is
"using the cultural characteristics, experiences, and perspectives of ethnically diverse students as
conduits for teaching them more effectively" (p. 106). Culturally responsive teaching "is not the
content, but rather the way in which you can reach your diverse learners." (King, 2015.)
Additionally, Gay (2000) details culturally responsive teaching as utilizing the

39

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
cultural knowledge, prior experiences, frames of reference, and performance styles of
ethnically diverse students to make learning encounters more relevant to and effective for
them. It teaches to and through the strengths of these students. It is culturally validating
and affirming. (p. 31)
Reminiscent of cultural competence, culturally responsive teaching recogruzes the
importance of including students' cultural references in all aspects of learning (Gay 2002,
Ladson-Billings, 1995). Culture can include race, religion, gender, ethnicity, and economic
backgrounds. Scholars contend that linking the students' personal culture to the classroom is
imperative for academic achievement (Gay, 2000, 2002, Hollins, 1996, King, 2014, LadsonBillings, 1994). Cultural background and practices shape thinking (Hollins, 1996). The linking
of culture and classroom, serve as tools for learning in and outside of school (Gay 2000).
Furthermore, Ladson-Billings (2009) confirms, "culturally relevant teaching is a pedagogy that
empowers students intellectually, socially, emotionally, and politically by using cultural referents
to impart knowledge, skills, and attitudes" (p. 20). Tatum (2000) asserts the "problem of how to
increase literacy in achievement of African-Americans is embedded in social, cultural, economic,
and historical dynamics" (p. 53). Culturally responsive teaching addresses these dynamics.
Gay (2000) revealed five components that distinguish those teachers, or librarians, who
engage culturally responsive practices. These elements include "developing a knowledge base
about cultural diversity, including ethnic and cultural diversity content in the curriculum,
demonstrating caring and building learning communities, communicating with ethnically diverse
students, and responding to ethnic diversity in the delivery of instruction" (p. 106). Additionally,
Gay (1975) states
Ethnic materials should be used to teach such fundamental skills as reading, writing,

40

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
calculating, and reasoning. Students can learn reading skills using materials written by
and about blacks, Mexican Americans, Italian Americans, and Jewish Americans as well
as they can from reading "Dick and Jane" . (p. 179)
Echoing the components of culturally responsive teaching, Abdullahi (2007) quoting the
"excellent advice" of Samovar, Porter, McDaniel, and Roy (1998) for those in multicultural
settings (p. 457). They state
(1) Teachers should be aware of what they "bring" to the classroom; (2) It is important to
know as much about the cultural backgrounds of students; (3) Assessing students'
acculturation levels will help teachers determine how much their students are involved in
their own culture as well as the Anglo-American culture; (4) Teachers can maintain an
open dialogue with the students; (5) A key characteristic of the component teacher is
empathy. (p. 458)
Ladson-Billings (2009) describes culturally responsive teachers as those who "help students
make connections between their local, national, racial, cultural and global identities" (p. 28).
Abdullahi (2007) describes librarians as "change agents whose job is to facilitate the growth of
knowledge and development of other human beings" (p. 456). Abdullahi (2007) suggests in
order to prepare future librarians for diversity, those educating them must "articulate a vision of
teaching and learning in a diverse society" (p. 458). Therefore, culturally responsive teaching
tenets apply to public and school librarians interacting with the students and patrons as much as
it does teachers.
Summary

The review of the literature presented above demonstrates that multicultural children's
literature is both valued and desired. It supports the idea that multicultural children's books

41

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
should be available in public libraries. The accessibility of multicultural children's literature in
public libraries has not emerged in the literature nor has librarian perceptions on such
collections.
Multiple factors influence collection development and selection decisions which possibly
leaving out multicultural titles.

Using the winning and honored titles from ethnic-specific

children's literature awards discussed above, will assure that the titles to be assessed in this study
portray diverse characters and cultures that are accurate and authentic. This qualitative case
study aims to delineate and analyze the award-winning and honored multicultural children's
literature in the Allegheny County Library Association community libraries and investigate the
acumens librarians have concerning multicultural collections. The following chapter will discuss
the research methodology to be implemented to explore the amount of ethnic-specific, awardwinning and honored multicultural children's literature in ACLA library collections and the
librarians' perceptions on the challenges and opportunities regarding such collections.

When you absolutely positively have to know, ask a librarian.
-American Library Association
Introduction

Chapter Two provided an examination of the research and literature pertaining to
multicultural children's books. While scholarly works demonstrate the need for multicultural
children's literature, little exists on the availability of those books in public libraries. The
purpose of this study is to describe the availability of ethnic specific, award-winning and
honored multicultural children's books in the juvenile literature collections of the Allegheny
County Library Association (ACLA) libraries, then inquiry the perceptions of librarians
regarding the challenges and opportunities of the multicultural children's collections. Examining
the multicultural book availability and the perceptions of the librarians on that availability will
add to the existing research.
As the United States continues to become more ethnically diverse, students need more
diverse characters in order to see themselves in the pages of the books they read. Multicultural
literature presents characters to which our diverse children can connect. Scholars agree that
multicultural children's literature is valuable to young readers (Al-Hazza & Bucher, 2008; Gay,
2003; Menodza & Reese, 2001). However, students' reading choices advantage white children
and marginalize children of color because children of color are under-represented (Gangi 2008,
Hughes-Hassell, Barkley, & Koehler, 2009). Numerous "educators urge for a culturally relevant
curriculum that portrays all groups accurately and authentically" (Morgan, 2011, pp. 357-358),
thus librarians, teachers, and pre-service teachers and librarians should know what quality
multicultural books are available to supplement and enhance their curriculum. An awareness of
the presence or absence of multicultural children's literature in these libraries may also
43

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
demonstrate a need to include multicultural children's literature in the youth collections of the
libraries regardless of the community demographics. Jansen (2015) reminds us, "The goal of a
public library is not just to serve as a mirror for our community, but to serve as an open door to
the world" (n.p.). This chapter describes the proposed data collection, instrumentation, and data
analyses methods needed in this investigation to compile the qualitative data that will answer the
following research question:
Given data on the amount of ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored multicultural
children's literature in the libraries of the Allegheny County Library Association and the
racial and income demographics of each library's community, what challenges and
opportunities do local librarians perceive regarding the acquisition and use of such
collections?
Type of Methodology

A case study is needed for this research in order to gain "an in-depth understanding" of
the above question (Creswell, 2012, p. 98). This exploratory case study will employ document
analysis and focus group interviews with semi-structured, open-ended questions to gain a deeper
understanding of what ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored multicultural literature is
available and what perceptions the librarians have regarding such collections. As a qualitative
methodological approach, this case study "allows investigators to retain the holistic and
meaningful characteristics of real life events" (Yin, 2008, p.4 ). Plus, Creswell (20 14) states that
qualitative research designs suit transformative writers because they have "a strong stimulus to
pursue topics that are of personal interest- issues that relate to marginalized people and an
interest in creating a better society for them and everyone" (p. 21 ).
Comprehensive data collection, which includes descriptive techniques to determine the

44

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
availability of the specified multicultural literature in the children's and youth collections in each
community branch of the ACLA will begin the procedures. Data regarding the amount of the
ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored multicultural children's literature will be collected
and documented by the researcher via the OPAC, which is continually maintained by the
eiNetwork for ACLA and Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh systems. Chapter 2 provided
information on each of the ethnic-specific book awards included in this study. The researcher
will gather and organize titles of the award winners and honorees from each award's website
making comprehensive lists. The researcher will also gather and organize information from the
United States Census Bureau website, Census Viewer, and City Data to investigate and record
the racial demographics as well as the median income information of the local communities
served by each library as determined by the neighborhood and library zip codes. Additionally,
document analysis will take place. Collection development policies of ACLA libraries will be
analyzed. ACLA libraries maintain their own websites that offer varied information about their
specific resources like programming and local community. Some of the library's sites offer
collection development policies. The researcher will collect the available policies and analyze
all collected documents.
After assembling and scrutinizing the data, focus group interviews will be conducted with
semi-structured, open-ended questions in order to examine the perceptions of the librarians
regarding challenges and opportunities in the acquisition and use of multicultural children's
literature. Children's librarians are chosen for focus groups not only because they interact with
the members of the community, but also because they make the book purchasing decisions. The
librarians will provide insight into the findings and "will best help the researcher understand the
problem and the research question" (Creswell, 2014, p. 189).

45

This study includes 45

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
neighborhood ACLA libraries. Each of these ACLA branches has a children's department
librarian who will be invited to participate in one of proposed focus group sessions. The openended, semi-structured focus group questions prepared by the researcher are shown in Appendix
A.
Why This Methodology to Study This Question

This study seeks first to evaluate the availability of ethnic-specific, award-winning and
honored multicultural children's book in public libraries and second, to examine the challenges
and opportunities perceived by librarians regarding the acquisition and use of multicultural
children's books. This is a multifaceted topic that needs a qualitative approach. Curry (2015)
defines qualitative research as "a strategy for systematic collection, organization and
interpretation of textual information" that incorporates " inductive approaches to generate novel
insights in phenomena that are difficult to measure quantitatively" (n.p.).

Creswell (2014)

claims, "qualitative approaches allow room to be innovative and to work more within researcherdesigned frameworks. They allow more creative, literary-style writing" (p. 21). Using an
exploratory, qualitative design that employs open-ended, semi-structured questions, allows for
"in-depth analysis of complex and layered issues" (Butin, 2010, p. 80).
This proposed qualitative case study design will utilize semi-structured, open-ended
questions with children's department librarians, a homogeneous group, as participants of a focus
group, which "can be used in order to explore new areas of research or to examine subjects wellknown to the participants" (Freitas, Oliveira, Jenkins, & Popjoy, 1998, p. 6). Focus groups allow
for deeper understandings and "take into consideration opinions and perspectives that may not
initially be visible or obvious" (Butin, 2010, p. 76). Krueger and Casey (2014) state, "focus
groups can provide insight into complicated topics" (p. 19), topics such as the availability of

46

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
multicultural children's literature in public libraries, the demographics of the community of the
library and perceptions of the librarians about those collections. Additionally, document analysis
of the collection development policies will add value to the study. Creswell (2014) suggests
using "data collection types that go beyond typical observations and interviews" (p. 190). The
qualitative design of this study proves pragmatic to address the aforementioned research
question.
Proposed Instruments or Protocols

Data regarding the availability of the multicultural children's literature will be collected
using the online catalog and organized on spreadsheets created by the researcher. Each of the
library community's race and median income figures will be collected from the United States
Census websites, Census Viewer, and City Data and entered onto spreadsheets also created by
the researcher. Microsoft Excel will be employed to create the spreadsheets in order to organize
textual data and demographic information. Collection development policies will be collected
from the library websites and will be analyzed. Focus group interviews with semi-structured,
open-ended questions will be conducted with ACLA children's department librarians to gather
information on their perceptions of the challenges and opportunities of collection development to
augment the inquiry. The focus group portion of the study will be recorded with permission and
the researcher will follow a semi-structured scripted list of open-ended questions. These
questions are found in Appendix A. Interviewees will be queried for potential factors influencing
their collection development and selection decisions. The interviews and collection development
policies will be examined for patterns and emerging themes will be developed based on the data.
The participants for the interview segment of this research study will be drawn from the 45
libraries included in this study from the Allegheny County Library Association. The researcher

47

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
will contact the director of each library to assist in locating the proper librarians. Detailed
procedures are outlined later in this chapter.
How Validity and Reliability Will Be Addressed
Creswell (2014) recommends including multiple approaches, which "enhance sources
that "enhance the researchers ability to assess the accuracy of the findings" (p. 201 ). This study
incorporates document analysis of collection development policies and focus group interviews of
librarians regarding the acquisition and use of multicultural children's books. The researcher will
follow an internal review board (IRB) approved, semi-structured list of questions for the focus
group interviews, which will be submitted and approved by the university faculty member who
serves on the dissertation committee of the researcher. These questions will then be piloted with
at least two experienced librarians to forecast and avoid potential problems. The researcher will
then make any needed adjustments to the questions. The focus group sessions will be recorded
and then transcribed so the researcher can review the data as many times as needed in order to
review for accuracy. The participants will be reminded that confidentiality is assured as stated in
the IRB approved Informed Consent letter. This letter can be found in Appendix B.
Data Collection Procedures
The researcher will adhere to the following procedures to assemble literature collection
information and community demographic information.
I. Prepare spreadsheet programs for data collection and organization.
2. Compile lists of award-winning and honor children's books to be assessed in the study.
3. Assemble the list of the libraries in the Allegheny County Library Association system to
be included in the study, noting the zip codes in the surrounding communities serviced by
that library.

48

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
4. Gather demographic data from the United States Census Bureau websites, Census
Viewer, and City Data for the zip code of each library to be included in the study.
5. Use the online public access catalog (OPAC) to determine the availability of the books in
each library included in this study.
6. Analyze and interpret the data and prepare tables to share information with librarians
during the semi -structured focus group interviews.
The researcher will follow these procedures to gather library collection development
policies.
1. Visit all of the individual ACLA library 'websites to find their collection development
policies.
2. After collecting the policies, print each.
3. Analyze the documents for patterns and themes.
The researcher will prepare for the focus groups interviews following the following steps.
1. Call the ACLA branch directors and librarians to request permission and support in
continuing the study and identifying potential interview participants, the children's
department librarians.
2. After collecting the librarians' emails via the library websites or phone calls to the
libraries, recruit the librarians to participate via email to take part in the study. This will
include details about the study and the proposed choices focus group days and times.
Four days with varied times will be scheduled. IRB approved informed consent
paperwork will also be included.
3. Schedule groups of 4-8 ACLA librarians, "small enough for everyone to have
opportunity, to share insights and yet large enough to provide diversity of perceptions"

49

Books used in the study. The researcher will begin the study by compiling multiple lists

of all of the winning and honored children's and young adult books from each of the eight
ethnic-specific awards described in Chapter 2. For this study, "children's literature" includes
books written for audiences whose ages range from birth through 18. Older titles from the 1960s
or 1970s will be included in this study, as many stories are considered timeless classics. The
ethnic-specific awards included are the American Indian Youth Literature Award, the Americas
Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature, the Arab American Book Award, the
Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature, the Carter G. Woodson Book Award, the Caretta
Scott King Book Awards, the

Pura Belpre Award, and Tomas Rivera Mexican American

Children's Book Award. Though the Carter G Woodson Book Award is not specific to one
ethnicity, it is included in this study because of its overall multicultural value and representation
of nonfiction works. Table 2 below displays information on the awards presented in this study.

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY

Each of the above ACLA libraries employs children's librarians and/or young adult/teen
librarians. These librarians' job responsibilities include collection development, which includes
purchasing new titles for their respective department.
The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh (CLP) system, though located in Allegheny
County, was excluded from this study for a few reasons. CLP consist of 18 branch locations in
various areas of Pittsburgh's city limits and contains well over a million and a half holdings.
CLP operates a central purchasing system meaning, one librarian at CLP is responsible for the
collection development and purchasing of the items for the children's and young adult
collections of those 18 locations. Some ACLA libraries have the name "Carnegie" in their title
but are not part of CLP.
Data Analysis Procedures

Analysis of the data collected for this investigation will follow a two-step
approach. The researcher will analyze the information on the availability of books collected from
OPAC and the
demographic information from United States Census Bureau as well as Census Viewer
and City Data, after entering the data into spreadsheets and tables.

This will include

investigating the percentages of the multicultural award-winners and honored books in the
library collections as well as looking at the racial make up and income data of each library's
area. Each focus group participant will receive a copy of the chart to facilitate discussion of the
issues. Table 4 below displays a sample visual overview.

The researcher will transcribe notes from each of the focus group interviews.
Formal data analysis will occur when all of the focus group sessions are complete and the
researcher listens to the recordings and reads the transcriptions. This will include note taking,
highlighting meaningful quotes, and searching for important themes. Using a deductive lens to
examine the data explicitly, the researcher will note common themes among the librarian
participants' answers. The answers to questions eliciting specific answers like "With what
children's book awards are you familiar?" will be noted. Then, the researcher will conduct
deductive content analysis searching for emerging themes and patterns.

libraries. This study will elucidate the amount of ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored
multicultural children's literature in the collections of the Allegheny County Library Association
(ACLA) libraries, thus adding to the sparse research. By utilizing focus group interviews, the
findings from this qualitative study will gain insights into the perceptions of ACLA librarians
regarding the multicultural children's literature collections in their libraries. Data from the
interviews will be examined for patterns and then analyzed for themes that may emerge. The
focus group interviews will foster a deeper understanding of the children's book data and provide
themes by allowing the librarians to share their diverse experiences. Also being examined for
patterns and themes are the available collection development policies. The main frameworks
supporting this comprehensive study include critical theory and critical race theory. "Critical
theory is in contrast to traditional theory that explores and confirms the status quo whereas
critical theory challenges the status quo and strives for a balanced and democratic society"
(Asghar, 2013, p. 3123). Brooks (2009) declares that critical race theory is a tool for literary
analysis. The next chapter will contain a comprehensive discussion of the findings, while
Chapter Five will present the implications of the study and recommendations.

Introduction

This qualitative case study sought to identify the availability of ethnic-specific, awardwinning multicultural children's literature in the libraries of the Allegheny County Library
Association (ACLA) and sought to explore children's department and youth librarians'
perceptions on the acquisition and use of such multicultural children's literature by answering
this research question:
Given data on the amount of ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored multicultural
children's literature in the libraries of the Allegheny County Library Association and the
racial and income demographics of each library's community, what challenges and
opportunities do local librarians perceive regarding the acquisition and use of such
collections?
This chapter will present an overview of the context and disclose the major findings of this
study.
Overview of Context

The researcher collected both the data on the availability of the award-winning and
honored multicultural children's literature for the specified awards and the demographic data for
each library's community. The researcher also gathered available collection development
policies from ACLA libraries. The researcher then conducted focus group interviews that were
transcribed for content analysis. Details on these procedures follow.

56

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY

Collecting book availability data and community demographics. The researcher
accessed each book award's website to identity winning and honored titles for the ethnic-specific
awards included in the study. The awards included are the American Indian Youth Literature
Award, the Americas Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature, the Arab American
Book Award, the Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature, the Carter G. Woodson Book
Award, the Coretta Scott King Book Awards, the DPura Belpre Award, and Tomas Rivera
Mexican American Children's Book Award. The titles were recorded effecting comprehensive
lists.

Next, the researcher created Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, one for each award, and

imported the list of ACLA libraries and the list of titles, to record the availability of the honored
titles in each library. Using the online public access catalog (OPAC), titles were entered and
tallied according to the home library listed for each title. OPAC, which is recurrently maintained
and updated by the eiNetwork for all ACLA libraries, displays the type of book (audio, CD, etc.)
and the libraries in which any searched book resides. The researcher verified book availability,
or unavailability, by also searching for each title in the OPAC by its author. Book availability
was recorded on the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet calculated percentages of award totals.
Figures 1-8 in Appendix D display total percentages of award winning and honored books
available in the 45 ACLA libraries.

Similar steps were followed to gather community

demographics.
The researcher created a table using Microsoft Word to organize library and community
demographic data. The list of ACLA libraries was imported into the table. Next, library zip
codes and communities served were gathered from library websites and entered onto the table.
The researcher located demographic data by searching United States Census Bureau websites,
Census.gov, Factfinder.census.gov, as well as Censusviewer.com. Provided percentages were

57

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
then entered into the table. For the few libraries with more than one location, the researcher
calculated weighted percentages for the different locations' zip codes and recorded those
calculated results on the table for the library. Upon completion of gathering the community
demographic data, the researcher created a new table.
This fmal table presents the community demographics along side the library holdings of
ethnic-specific awards being evaluated. This complete table, Table 11, which displays
information for all ACLA libraries, can be found in Appendix F. Statistical analysis of the data
set is not in the scope of this study. To avoid overwhelming the focus group participants, the
researcher presented a sampling of ten libraries' findings during the sessions. The names of the
libraries were removed. This sampling is represented in Figure I. The purpose of Figure I was to
give the focus group librarians a general picture of each library's community demographics and
the percentages of each award available in each library, as well as a sampling of other ACLA
libraries for observation and comparison. The table was also helpful in facilitating discussion
during the focus group sessions. Librarian perceptions on the availability will be discussed later.
The researcher chose the ten ACLA libraries purposefully to include the focus group
participants' libraries. There was one additional library added. The researcher chose this library
because its median income was close to another in the sample. Librarians' perceptions and
observations of the availability data and community demographics were recorded.

depicts what was presented to focus group participants.

Gathering collection development policies. The researcher obtained eleven collection
development policies. One policy represented the ALCA organization as indicated by its title,
Allegheny County Library Association Countywide Collection Management Statement, while
the other ten collection development policies were specific to. branch library locations and
obtained from their websites. Butin reminds scholars that documents, such as these collection
development policies, are "the 'face' and thus representation of the individual or organization
that makes it public" (p. 99), The researcher analyzed the policies noting repetitions and finding
patterns and similarities.

59

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Organizing and conducting focus group interviews. The researcher developed the list

of questions for the focus group interview. These semi-structured, open-ended questions were
designed to gain a deeper understanding of the librarian participants' perceptions regarding the
collection of ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored multicultural literature. Krueger and
Casey (2014) state, "too often questions are thrown together, are not properly pilot-tested, and
the results are of limited benefit" (p. xiv). Thus, the researcher pilot-tested the questions and
focus group procedures with two colleagues, both school librarians, one a former public
librarian. Here the researcher determined it was best to only present a sample of the library book
and community fmdings, rather than data for all 45 libraries. The researcher also added an
additional question, Question 11. What relationship if any do you have with local school systems
and its teachers? The full list of questions is found in Appendix A. The list of questions,

research methodology, and research steps were then submitted for IRB approval.
Upon gaining university IRB approval, the researcher then coordinated, organized, and
conducted the focus groups. After, determining and securing varied library locations around
Allegheny County and assorted date and times, the researcher emailed invitations to the children
and youth librarians of the ACLA libraries. The invitations included details about the study and
the options of four focus groups being offered around the county. Also attached to the email
were consent forms.

The invitation and consent forms are presented in Appendix B.

As

librarians responded with their preferred date and time, the researcher scheduled participants into
four focus group sessions. The researcher confirmed with the librarians and thanked them in
advance for their participation. This letter is included in Appendix C.
After receiving the interview invite, one library director contacted the researcher and
proposed conducting a focus group at their approaching staff meeting. The meeting included the

60

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
children's and youth librarians. The researcher accepted this opportunity. A total of four focus
group sessions were conducted.
At the start of each session, librarians completed demographic forms, which were
collected by the researcher with the consent forms. The researcher reminded participants to
"chime in" whenever they wanted to share their input. The sessions were audio-recorded using a
Sony Digital Voice Recorder. The same open-ended, semi-structured questions were asked at
each session. The researcher asked the first two questions about book awards prior to distributing
the chart indicating awards and availability to the participants. The first two questions are
1. With what children's book awards are you familiar?

2. How important do you believe award lists are for developing your collection? Do you
use these award lists when selecting books for the children's collection? Which ones and
why or why not?
After these first two questions, the researcher distributed and explained the community
demographics and library holdings displayed above in Figure 1.

The researcher chose ten

libraries, the libraries of the participants as well as one additional that had a comparable median
income to one participant's library. Providing a chart with information for only ten libraries
avoided confusing and overwhelming the participants with too much data and facilitated easier
understanding of the presented information. After receiving the chart, one participant exclaimed,
"Oh! I am not a good-like I can't interpret data!" The researcher explained and clarified the
chart and answered participant questions before proceeding with the interview session.
During each session, the researcher took measures to remain neutral while listening
attentively "not only for the content of focus group discussions, but for emotions, ironies,
contradictions, and tensions" (Grudens-Schuck, Allen, & Larson, 2004, n.p). The researcher

61

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
stayed objective while listening to the participants' answers, nodding, jotting notes, and asking
for clarification only when needed. Sometimes the researcher repeated the question and gave
cues such as, "Hmm... interesting" to elicit "thicker" input and participation from other
librarians (Butin, 2010, p. 97, 98). At the end of each session, one participant received a raffled
gift card for $50 to an online retailer, which had been offered as an incentive to participate in a
focus group. Later, the researcher mailed handwritten thank you notes to the participants.
Audio files were promptly stored on a password-protected computer and deleted from the
recording device. The researcher was sure to redact identifiable participant information to
safeguard confidentiality prior to sending the files to a third party transcriber.

Once the

transcriptions were completed and received, coding began.
Coding procedures. Using an iterative process, the researcher "develop[ed] codes only

on the basis of the emerging information collected from participants" (Creswell, 2014, p.199).
This "traditional approach" allowed for scrutinizing the data for patterns and themes inductively
(Creswell, 2014, p.199). First, the researcher simply listened to the recordings of each focus
group. Next, the researcher listened to the audio while reading along with the transcribed
interviews for text accuracy. While formal analysis did not occur at this time, the researcher took
note of pertinent quotes and highlighted similarities.
The coding then began as the researcher used a deductive lens to analyze overt
information and common answers. Short answers to questions in the focus group interview
protocol noted in Appendix D, like "With what children's book awards are you familiar?" and
"Do you use these award lists when selecting books for the children's collection? Which ones
and why or why not?" were noted and descriptive statistics were used to record frequencies. The
researcher reread the four focus group transcripts several times, noting and sorting recurring

62

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
answers throughout the different focus groups, consequently uncovering patterns and codes. The
codes were then sub-coded and organized into the encompassing themes.

Data for this

qualitative study are words or key phrases that represent the essence or key attribute of
narrative/verbal information. The data was analyzed into codes, or segments of the data that are
similar in some way, and sub-codes, segments of data that are similar in some way and relate to
the code. The findings from the four focus group interview sessions are discussed later in the
chapter.

Presentation of Data
Analysis of collection development policies. The researcher accumulated eleven
collection development policies, one representing ACLA and ten documents representing ACLA
branch libraries. These policies outline collection development criteria, selection methods, and
analysis and maintenance guidelines, aiming for the "common goal of providing quality library
service to the residents of Allegheny County" (Allegheny County Library Association
Countywide Collection Management Statement, p.l ). Most of the policies, eight of the eleven,
reference or even included the American Library Association's Library Bill of Rights. Though
only eight collection development polices made specific mention of the interlibrary loan (ILL)
service, all of the ACLA libraries participate. This sharing feature makes it possible for ACLA
libraries to "expand and increase their impact, outreach, and service to the residents" (Allegheny
County Library Association Countywide Collection Management Statement, p.6).
The policies also describe criteria for library materials as well as collection analysis and
maintenance guidelines. The policies were consistent asking for the collections to "reflect the
needs and interests of the local communities" and "reflect the cultural, linguist and ethnic
diversity of Allegheny County" (Allegheny County Library Association Countywide Collection

63

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Management Statement, p.l ). According to the policies, balancing the collection is also
important. Finally, the policies suggested librarians used their "professional judgment" when
weeding the collection and offered lack of circulation, condition, and age of the materials as
considerations when analyzing and weeding the collections (Allegheny County Library
Association Countywide Collection Management Statement, p.7). A synopsis of this information
is found below in Table 5. Much data from the four focus group sessions echoed this data. These
and further findings are detailed.

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY

Librarian participant demographics. This study used focus group interviews to
examine librarians' perceptions on the acquisition and use of multicultural children's literature.
Because this study is grounded in critical theory and critical race theory, the demographic
characteristics of the librarian participants is important to note. All sixteen public librarian
participants completed the questionnaire by specifYing the following characteristics.
Participating librarians all identified themselves as female and white. This I 00% total
echoes the 2010, American Community Survey Estimates Applied to Institute for Museum and
Library Services and National Center for Education Statistics Data, which showed 85% of
credentialed public librarians were white. All librarians participating in this study had completed
a Bachelors level of education and the majority, thirteen of the sixteen, had earned a Masters
degree. In the age category, five participants identified themselves 61 or older, two identifYing
as over 70. Two participants specified they were in the 51-60 age category and six in the 41-50
age range. Three librarians indicated they were under 40 years of age. There was a wide range in
years of service. Experience in the library field spanned from nine months to 45 years of service
in the field. Table 6 outlines the demographics for the participants.

Focus group findings. This study used focus group interviews to examine librarians'
perceptions on the acquisition and use of multicultural children's literature.

The interview

questions are included in Appendix A. Some questions provided data easily analyzed deductively
and provided descriptive data. These interview questions were specific and therefore elicited
specific responses such as the names of children's book awards known to the participants.
Further exposure to the data allowed the researcher to use an inductive analytic approach to
digest data gathered from the other questions presented during the focus group sessions. The data
revealed codes and sub-codes, which fell under three main themes. The researcher labeled the
main themes as Acquisition Challenges, Challenges in Use, and Opportunities. Table 7 lists the
final codes and sub-codes under each theme.

Before the codes and sub-codes are discussed, presented next are the known children's literature
awards, librarian perceptions of multicultural book availability, and librarian relationships with
schools will be described.

Known awards and importance to collection. The first question in each focus group
session was "With what children's book awards are you familiar?"

Librarians identified

numerous book awards. Many of the awards confirmed by the librarians are acknowledged by
the ALA, the American Library Association, and its divisions specifically, the ALSC, the
Association for Library Services to Children and YALSA, the Young Adult Library Services
Association. The awards recognized by the ALA via their web pages, which were mentioned in
each of the four focus groups, include the Caldecott Medal, the Newbery Medal, the Geisel
Award, the Caretta Scott King Award, and the Pura Belpre Award. Of those five, two are
ethuic-specific and included in this study; they are the Caretta Scott King Award and the Pura

68

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Belpre A ward. These were also the only two awards under investigation in this study identified
by any of the librarians during the focus group sessions. While the American Indian Youth
Literature Award is an affiliate of the ALA, the award is not presented amongst the other listed
awards on the ALA's webpages. Table 8 displays the awards mentioned by the participants and
whether or not the ALA recognizes the award as indicated by inclusion on their webpage lists.

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
More information was found when the librarians shared their perceptions and observations about
the demographic and book availability chart.

Perceptions of book availability. The availability of the award-winning and honored
books from each of the eight children's book awards included in the study varied greatly
between awards and between the ACLA libraries. The percentages were charted (See Appendix
D and Appendix E) and presented to the librarians as described earlier in this chapter. Table 9 at
the end of this section displays a synopsis of the amount of books included in each award and the
highest and lowest percentages found. Librarians had assorted reactions to the availability of the
different awards. Some librarians were disappointed with their library's award-winning and
honored books multicultural books. One participant stated, "I'm not surprised by the statistics.
We're a very small library, with a small budget." Another said, "For the Coretta Scott King
Award we're at 28%. That's pretty bad." Yet other participants were pleased with some of their
availability stating, "I think we've done very well" and "36% with the Asian Pacific American
Award for Literature, that's high". As one librarian stated, "I think we're trying to be inclusive
despite our demographics."
Some observations librarians shared mentioned both their population and specific awards.
Noting her patrons' preferences, one librarian commented, "I'm not surprised that we have a
high percentage of the Coretta Scott King, simply because most of our regular patrons are
African-American patrons. So we have many requests for characters who are African-American
or biracial." Another participant shared this, "What I find interesting is that we have like no
Hispanic people. It's pretty much black and white in [name of community] but we have more
books for Tomas Rivera and Pura Belpre than we do for Coretta Scott King." While another
librarian observed and shared her thoughts.

70

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
OK, Library 3, like it doesn't make me feel as bad because they have a higher. .. 8.9
percent ... of their population, is African-American. But they have a smaller selection of
books that would-you know Coretta Scott King Award books.
Librarian participants expressed interest in why other libraries had higher percentages of
availability of some of the books. One librarian assumed, "Well they also have more money
probably, like in their budget as well."

Another stated, "Library 4 has 90% of the Arab

American Book Awards. So I would think they would have some patron input on how to
purchase those. Versus us, we may not get as much patron input."
Despite the mixed reactions and varied observations, all participants shared they were
"glad that they [the available ethnic-specific award winning and honored books] are there".

Relationship with the schools. The researcher asked the focus group participants to
describe their relationship with the local school system and its teachers. Almost all librarians
71

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
noted favorable relationships with the local schools and teachers using descriptors like "good",
"very good", "pretty good" and "super". Many described visiting the schools to promote their
library's summer reading programs. One librarian participates in "Career Day at the middle
school".

Another participant described being "invited to do Read Across America Day,

celebrating Dr. Seuss's birthday. We each get to visit a classroom and read to them". Librarians
" really do try to support the schools".
Three librarians stressed the importance of having positive relationships with the school
administrators. One stated, "The principal makes a huge difference in everything. If the principal
is not enthusiastic about it, it's [the relationship] not going to happen." Another participant
described her relationship with her library's local school district and it's administration.
I have a super relationship with [name of district] schools. It's amazing. I don't know.
I've never seen anything like it. And I worked at ACLA and I think libraries- it would
be amazing if libraries had that kind of relationship. We have it from the superintendent
down, who comes to our meetings.
In contrast, two participants noted unfavorable relationships. One described her relationship
with the schools and as "patchy". The other participant who shared thoughts on an unfavorable
relationship stated,
It is always a fight, an uphill battle. I hate to be Debbie Downer, but I mean, it really is. I

don't understand it because we are providing a service to them, to take some, you know,
to take some off their shoulders. I've done assemblies where the principal's like this
[body language of checking a watch] on her watch while I'm giving it.
The focus group sessions revealed other challenges faced by the participating ACLA librarians.

72

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Acquisition challenges. Acquisition was defined as obtaining materials for the library's

collection. Librarians discussed challenges they faced when acquiring children's literature for
their collections.

Selection resources.

The first maJor challenge m the acquisition of multicultural

children's literature identified was Selection Resources.

Selection resources are defined as

sources used to choose materials for the collection. Each focus group mentioned utilizing four
sources for selection. They include award lists, review journals, patron requests, and other media.
Award lists and review journals were popular sources used by the participants, because as one
librarian from the first focus group stated, "I'm looking for accredited, reviewed sources for
buying books." While most librarians in the focus groups agree that award lists and review
journals are useful in providing a "good barometer of knowing what quality literature is out
there", only two lists mentioned by the participants, the Coretta Scott King Award list and the
Pura Belpre Award list are ethnic-specific and thus present exclusively ethnic-specific books.
The remaining lists and review journals used for selection mentioned by the librarians during this
study are all-inclusive and often lack muJticultural materials. Table I 0 below specifies the
awards and reviews the participants shared during the sessions.

An additional resource for selecting materials mentioned in all four of the focus group
sessions was requests. Requests are defined as suggestions the library/librarian use to purchase
specific materials, came from teachers and patrons. Librarians attempt to predict patron requests,
"I also check to see what Amazon is kind of pushing. Because I think those are the things that
the public is going to come in and ask for."
This leads to the final resource used in acquisition, other media. Other media, defined as
alternative library resources such as online reviews, librarian blogs, or hashtags assist m
acquisition. A hashtag is a word or phrase following a hash or pound sign used to demarcate
communications on varied topics. One librarian reported:
I seek out a lot of alternate sources. So I follow a lot of hashtags actually to get booklists
that would be from some very nontraditional publishers because of my community, and
because a lot of the--you know, like the "thousand black girls read hashtag". And that
sprung out a lot of booklists that connect me with a lot of different publishers.

74

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
The hashtag referenced here is #1000blackgirlbooks which was started recently by an eleven
year old girl, Marley Dias, who set out to collect 1,000 books about black girls (Barack, 20 16).
Selection procedures. Additional acquisition codes that emerged from the focus group
data can be labeled under Selection Procedures. Selection procedures are defined as actions taken
when choosing books to build the collection. None of the librarians referenced utilizing a formal
selection process when discussing processes and procedures when building their collections.
Throughout the four focus groups, only two librarians made brief mention of their library's
collection development policy.

One stated "I'm kind of a newish librarian and I'm not as

familiar with the collection development policy at my library" while the other stated, "we have a
formal collection development policy that just outlines, basically you buy things you think
people will read." Throughout the sessions, all groups reported the desire to select books that
balance their collection.
Balance can be defined as an even distribution of quality, popular, and diverse literature.
The researcher utilized words and ideas gathered from the focus group discussions. This presents
a challenge for many of the librarians. One participant explained:
I think that we do need to do a better job of incorporating more diverse material. But it's
very hard to strike a balance between the quality stuff that as a librarian you feel should
be on the shelves, and the stuff you know will circulate. Especially when you have a
limited amount to spend.
Another librarian agreed, "So it's very difficult to choose which titles will both circulate and be
representative of the community." Similarly, another participant stated:
We're a very small library with a small budget. And I don't know what the criteria for
purchasing materials was before I came on a couple years ago. But the vast majority of

75

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
stuff we purchase is the stuff that's going to circulate. And even though our population is
fairly diverse, the things that circulate tend to be the popular franchise stuff, which itself
is not diverse.
Another librarian posed this question:
The demographics of this area do not promote a lot of interest in books of those
[multicultural] natures ... You're between a rock and a hard place by doing, and having
the right stuff there, and exposing your community to it, but they're not taking it out. So
is it a waste of money, or isn't it?
Participants also described budget as a factor in their selection processes. Budget denotes
financial considerations that may affect acquisition of library materials. Librarians reported that
Pennsylvania has regulations that determine what librarians can spend on their collections, "PA
mandates 12% goes to your collection. You're at a risk of losing your state funding if you don't
maintain that 12% ratio". One participant from a smaller library stated that smaller libraries have
smaller budgets "So you know, you have to be super selective. You can't just order one of
everything." Another focus group member echoed this stating, "We have to be careful how we
spend our money, spend it wisely".

While other librarians had plenty, "I am very lucky here

that we have a good budget. And I can afford to buy things that-and take a chance on things"
Personal preference emerged from the focus group data as an additional sub-code. A
librarian's personal preference can influence her selection of titles when adding to their
collection. One participant aptly reveals, "Well I try to buy my books because I think they're a
good book regardless of who the main characters are." Another librarian plainly states, "I wasn't
going to buy it [a Newberry winner] because it wasn't something I'd like to read." Librarians
vary, thus their personal preferences will diverge.

76

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY

All librarians also reported using vendors to acquire books for their collections. Vendors
are defined as booksellers connected to the library. When purchasing books, some librarians are
confined to getting the bulk of their children's books via their vendor/s. One focus group
reported that the vendors often lack multicultural materials, "because we are pretty much
constrained to use [the vendor], if [the vendor] hasn't picked it up, we won't be able to find it".
Conversely, other librarians had more freedom to purchase books from venues such as an online
retailer or local store:
We do [names vendors] but I am allowed to buy from Amazon and I'm allowed to go to
Scholastic Book Sale. I'm allowed to go to Barnes and Noble and buy a book. And I
know some libraries are not allowed to do that.
The above examples display challenges in selection procedures librarians face when building
their collections.
Challenges in use. Challenges regarding the use of multicultural children's literature
surfaced from the focus group data.
Circulation and weeding. Circulation is defmed as the use of library materials that can be
borrowed or checked out. Librarians often examine the circulation information of the materials in
their collections to assess the use and popularity of the items.
Lack of circulation is the main reason multicultural children's books can be weeded, or
removed from the collection. One librarian discussed
We use the catalog obviously to check on circulation. And sometimes like certain books
just don't eire in our library and they might eire like mad at different places. I think too

77

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY

like the place-where your library is and who your patrons are I guess, and maybe their
background.
Repeating her sentiments, this participant explained her considerations of circulation and
weeding.
I think the only way to tell how a collection is used is by inventorying it and weeding it.

And that's where you get the stats as to how often a book is going out or not. You can
look at the book, look at that title, and if it's not [being circulated]- and that's why I said
what I did before. I could buy those books but they're not going off the shelves. And
eventually then they just get discarded. And they've not been used. And that's
unfortunate that's what happens.
Many librarians commented on the perplexing lack of circulation of multicultural children's
literature. One librarian expressed consternation.
I will go on record with my name and say this because it is appalling to me. However, I

could have 100% of all of these [award winning and honored multicultural books], and I
could then, within a year, weed I 00% of all of them because in my library, if you have a
face of color on the cover you are not going to go out, 99% of the time. And it doesn't
matter if it is Martin Luther King or if it is a picture of a black mermaid. It's not going
out.
A different participant expressed her puzzlement.
You know, it's interesting because we have a fairly sizeable black population in our
municipality itself. But for whatever reason they don't use the library. So we also have
been weeding a number of good titles with multicultural characters on the cover. And
they just-they haven't gone out in four years, that's our criteria. But then we'll put them

78

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
in a cardboard box, just, you can take them for free and they're gone within two days. So
I don't understand why they sit on the shelf and no one wants them. But once it's free to
take home people take them.
Most in the focus group discussions specifically expressed a desire to solve the "challenge to
make it something they want to read."
Weeding also occurs if a book is tattered or deemed unsuitable. "One of the huge
functions of weeding is not just to get books that haven't circulated, but also to find books that
might not be the way you want to represent your library." She continues this sentiment in a
dialogue with another focus group librarian.
Participant 1: I have absolutely weeded books that might have been perfectly good, like
they're not because they're like moldy or whatever. But I'm just like, nope, this is just
not appropriate for my community. This is not something I want represented in my
library. So I had to definitely pull the books. And not as like an, "Oh, I don't think you're
mature enough to read this." Not in a censorship way, but definitely in a like, we have
moved on from this. This is not something that is reflective of current attitudes and
cultures. And it's not like an archivist thing.
Participant 2: Yeah not old enough to be historic.
Participant 1: Just old enough to be really offensive. But I would wonder how many
libraries have books like that still on their shelves. Because I have gone through my
collection multiple times and I still find things.
Lack of circulation poses a challenge in the use on multicultural children's literature. Personal
attitudes and experiences of the librarians also can affect the use of multicultural children's
literature.

79

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY

Personal views and experiences. Personal Views and Experiences is another sub-code
which emerged from the interviews. Personal views and experiences are defined as subjective
attitudes about, involvement with, and knowledge of multicultural children's literature.

A

participant aptly stated, "everyone has a different opinion about what [their] collection should
look like." Thus, library collections are varied. The librarians in the focus group interviews
shared their views on and varied experiences with multicultural children's literature. Talking
about selection, a librarian describes part of her process.
Well I try to buy my books because I think they're a good book regardless of who the
main characters are. But I do try to get some of the- always try to get some of the Coretta
Scott King books if I hadn't purchased them up to the point where you know, they won
the award.
Another participant stated, "If it's one I like, I'll put in on display." Similarly, this participant
specified, "I wasn't going to buy it [a Newberry winner] because it wasn't something I'd like to
read." Conversely, this librarian has a different approach. "I also insist on buying people of
color to put on the books. So I do that too to try to even it out. Because I think you are--I don't
know-they [the library patrons] don't need what they need." A participant from a different
library agreed, "I think we're trying to be inclusive despite our demographics." While one
librarian acknowledged, "I don't necessarily consider multicultural all the time," another
librarian stated this:
I feel like it's [viewing the availability chart from the researcher] a good wake up call to
us. I feel like when I build my collection I'm really hyper aware oflike where politically
I fall, and genre wise, like the things I love to read, and the political things I believe. That
I am always like OK row hard the other way and make sure I have . . . And I don't feel

80

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
like I do that gender wise and like racially. But it's a good reminder to be like I have to
think about that too, to be really aware of that.
Participants agreed that having multicultural children's literature as part of their
collections is "an important thing."

Some expressed the desire for more and how their

multicultural children's collection "definitely needs beefed up." Some participants expressed
concern that obtaining these types of books is difficult stating, "You have to hunt for these.
These are buried." While another librarian commiserated, "I don't have a specific resource ...
it's just knowing where to fmd it. .. How do we find it? Where? How do we enhance it?"
Librarians sometimes shared varied opinions on the appropriateness of some
multicultural literature.
Participant A: Folktales back in the seventies and earlier were very often written by
people not of that culture who had never researched that culture.
Participant B: Yeah, Five Chinese Brothers can really put the back up of anyone who is
Chinese.
Participant A: Right. Tikki Tikki Tembo is another one.
Participant D: But they're such grand stories [laughs].
Another participant shared this.
I know I have done that [removed books from the collection] a lot with our American
Indian [books]. Like I've gone through a lot of those books and I was like, "This is
awful." ... like that Brother Eagle, Sister Sky. I pulled it because it circulates all the time
but it's incredibly inaccurate. And I wasn't, didn't want that to be perpetuated.
Participant 1: What title was that?
Participant 2: Brother Eagle, Sister Sky.

81

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Participant 1: Oh.
Participant 2: Incredibly popular. Incredibly inaccurate.
Participant 1: Yeah weren't the illustrations the wrong tribe or something?
Participant 2: Yep. All over the place.
Similarly, another librarian proved conscientious of her choices. In reference to consulting an
author's blog she states:
She usually gives a pretty good review as to the authenticity about what's being
discussed. And for me, if I'm going to take a chance on a book, I want for a culture I'm
not a part of, I want to see how authentic it is. So, I will look at what she's seeing
sometimes on books that have been very controversial as far as stereotypes go.
Two participants shared pertinent self-censoring experiences. Self-censoring is when one
controls of what s/he says or does in order to avoid annoying or offending others, but without
being told officially that such control is necessary. The first narrative involves helping a child
find a book.
I had a little girl who was I believe Asian-American in with her mom and her ... looking
for some easy readers that you know would be fun. So I showed her where to browse and
everything. And while I was in that section I kind of like passed by a-Grace Lin hasyou know Asian-American author, has Ling & Ting, they're like twin sisters who aren't
exactly the same, who have often different personalities. . . . These are easy readers. . ..
They're like, "Here's your introduction to a book." But I almost pulled it off the shelf to
hand to her and then I didn't. Because I like was-I guess afraid of being too on the nose
like, "Oh hey, you're an Asian kid. Here's a book about Asian kids", especially with her
parents right there. . .. And I was worried. I was very self-conscious in my position of

82

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
like, you know, white lady librarian handing you these books and making this call that of
course you would want this one because you're one of those people. And on the other
hand, I don't know, I'm still a little conflicted about that. ... I just want to put that out
there that sometimes we do self-censor. And maybe it was a good thing. But maybe it
was also like I could have given her this reader that she might have enjoyed about like,
you know the cute story about sisters. And I felt I censored myself out of like fear of
them reacting badly to me, which is, I don't know just like self-consciousness on my part.
And maybe that's letting my own, you know, letting myself get in the way of putting a
book in front of a kid that could have enjoyed it.
The second account of self-censoring entails a read-aloud experience.
I go once a month to read at [local public housing community]. I was going to read Last
Stop on Market Street, which won the Caldecott [honor] and Newbery and we were like

all excited and whatever. But then I felt weird about reading it to them because here I am
an old white lady coming in and telling these little black faces-and reading this book
about them and them getting on the bus, like they don't have a car. And then they're
going to the food pantry and whatever. I just, I couldn't do it. I changed and did
something else because I just felt uncomfortable doing that. ... I just felt uncomfortable.
And I felt like my uncomfort with that was going to somehow affect them or something.
So I just, I didn't want them to think this is what I thought that their lives were about.
That they were poor and they went, you know, didn't have a car and they rode the bus
and their grandma took them to the food pantry to get their Sunday dinner. I didn't want
them to think that I thought that. Which was, I don't know ...

83

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
The varied views and experiences expressed by the librarians during the focus groups also
present opportunities.
Opportunities. An additional topic that was discussed during the focus group sessions is

labeled as Opportunities. Opportunities are defined as prospects for multicultural children's
literature.
Use multicultural resources for selection. The librarians revealed resources for the

selection of specifically multicultural children's and young adult literature. These resources can
assist in assessment and selection of multicultural children's literature. Resources stated were
blogs, websites, hashtags, publishers and the award lists, all for diversity in literature.
Specifically mentioned were Reading While White, We Need Diverse Books, blogs by Debbie
Reese, #1000 BlackGir!Books, and Lee and Low publishers. Participants also mentioned the
newly known ethnic specific award lists presented by the researcher earlier in the session. One
librarian stated, "I need to get familiar with these awards-I wasn't-as I said, except for the
Coretta Scott King Award, I wasn't familiar with these other awards." Another participant
agreed, "staff awareness is one part of it".
Opportunities in the usage of multicultural children's literature also emerged from the
focus group data.
Add multicultural literature to programs. Participants mentioned highlighting the diverse

literature making "it something they [their patrons] want to read". One librarians recalled a
special program, "We did this [program] a couple summer's ago. We highlighted different
cultures in the world." Her colleague added, "I thought it was the best one ever." She replied, "It
was!" Other focus group participants suggested adding diverse children's literature to their
varied programs such as story time, summer reading programs, summer reading lists, "book

battles" and displays. Also proposed was highlighting authors and illustrators of diverse
backgrounds by having them as special guests.
Summary of Key Findings

This chapter first specified the context of the study and then presented its findings. The
researcher revealed an analysis of the collection development policies and the demographics of
the librarian focus group participants, followed by the community demographics and awardwinning and honored multicultural children's book availability in ACLA libraries. A sampling
of that data was presented to the librarians during the focus group sessions. Librarians divulged
their observations and perceptions on the availability of the awarded multicultural children's
books. Also presented in this chapter were the children's literature awards mentioned by
participants during the focus groups sessions. Relationships between the participating ACLA
librarians and the local schools were described as well.
Other findings from the focus group transcripts uncovered themes and codes. The main
themes that emerged from the focus group sessions are labeled as Acquisition Challenges,
Challenges in Use, and Opportunities. Codes falling under the theme of Acquisition Challenges
include Selection Resources and Selection Procedure. Codes falling under the theme of
Challenges in Use include Circulation and Weeding and Personal Views and Experiences.
Codes falling under the theme Opportunities include Using Multicultural Resources for Selection
and Adding Multicultural Children's Literature to Library Programs. The following chapter will
discuss these fmdings by identifying important learning developed through the study and its
application and implications to theory and practice, as well as recommendations for further
research.

Introduction

Public libraries are a valuable resource for students, especially those who have limited
books at home, and for teachers who want to supplement the collections in their classroom and
school library. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), children of
color now make up more than half of the K-12 public school population in the United States.
This increase in ethnic diversity of school age children holds strong implications for the
community libraries that serve them. Children's literature should be diverse because young
readers need books that serve as mirrors and windows. Multicultural children's literature, like a
mirror, can reflect diverse children and their culture; as a result they see their culture is valued.
Like a window, multicultural literature allows readers to peer through to view and value other
cultures. "All children need both" (Bishop, 2012 p. 9).
This qualitative case study identified the availability of ethnic-specific, award-winning
multicultural children's literature in the libraries of the Allegheny County Library Association
(ACLA) and sought to explore children's department and youth librarians' perceptions on the
acquisition and use of such multicultural children's literature by answering this research
question:
Given data on the amount of ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored multicultural
children's literature in the libraries of the Allegheny County Library Association and the
racial and income demographics of each library's community, what challenges and

86

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
opportunities do local librarians perceive regarding the acquisition and use of such
collections?
The processes of this study, surveying the library holdings for award-winning and honored
multicultural children's books, assembling the community demographics, appraising the
libraries' collection development policies, and conducting focus group interviews, amassed the
findings presented in Chapter 4. They will be discussed here, as they relate to the research
question, the literature review, and theoretical frameworks presented in Chapter 2.
Recommendations for future research will follow.
Restating the Pnrpose of the Stndy

Children's literature should depict diversity of people and experiences (Bishop, 1990)
and should be on the shelves of public libraries (Benton 2014, Jenson 2015). "It is essential to
make a concerted effort to provide enough textual variety so that students can have the chance to
see themselves reflected in the books that are available in classroom and school libraries" (Wood
and Jocius, 2013, p. 665). Therefore, the availability of multicultural children's literature as well
as librarians' perceptions and practices need to be examined. The purpose of this case study was
to critically investigate perceptions of the children's department librarians regarding the
availability, acquisition, and use of ethnic-specific, award-winning multicultural children's
literature in the branch libraries of ACLA. The awards included are the Americas Award, Arab
American Book Award, the American Indian Youth Literature Award, the Asian/Pacific
American Award for Literature, the Carter G. Woodson Book Award, the Coretta Scott King
Book Awards, the DPura Belpre Award, and the Tomas Rivera Mexican American Children's
Book Award. Though not ethnic-specific, the Carter G. Woodson award is included because of
its overall multicultural value and representation of nonfiction works. This study adds to the

87

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
literature by further understanding librarian's perceptions on the availability, acquisition and use
of multicultural children's literature in public libraries and hopes to influence how librarians
evaluate their children's book collections as well as reflect on their collection attainment
processes.

Important Learning from the Stndy
Presented below are important concepts accrued from this study's fmdings presented in
detail in Chapter 4. Each section will provide a pertinent discussion of the concepts followed by
key learning statements.

Collection development policies.

The researcher investigated eleven collection

development policies, one representing ACLA and ten documents representing varied ACLA
branch libraries.

These public policies serve as the guidelines for the library's collection

development criteria like selection methods, and analysis and maintenance. "Good collection
development policies should emphasize a variety of things, but one of them should most
defmitely be diversity" (Jansen, 2015, n.p.). The researcher found conflicts within these policies
and between the policies and the librarians' practices. The policies were consistent in asking for
the collections to "reflect the needs and interests of the local communities" and to "reflect the
cultural, linguist and ethnic diversity of Allegheny County" (Allegheny County Library
Association Countywide Collection Management Statement, p.l). However, according to the
focus group participants the interests of the local patrons do not reflect the diversity of Allegheny
County, suggesting these two guidelines contradict each other.

The librarians claimed the

patrons do not check out the multicultural children's books. One participant stated, "And even
though our population is fairly diverse, the things that circulate tend to be the popular franchise
stuff, which itself is not diverse." Another librarian from the same session continued, "So it's

88

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
very difficult to choose which titles will both circulate and be representative of the community."
Another librarian regretfully asserted
In my library, if you have a face of color on the cover you are not going to go out 99% of
the time. And it doesn't matter if it is Martin Luther King or if it is a picture of a black
mermaid. It's not going out.
The librarians, all in favor of more multicultural literature, were perplexed. One participant
posed this question to her group, "do you build a collection that you really think helps the
community? Or do you build a collection that the community wants?" The American Library
Association (ALA) Library Bill of Rights would answer, "A collection that helps the
community." The ALA's Bill of Rights, specifically referenced in most, nine of the eleven, of
the ACLA collection development policies states, "Books and other library resources should be
provided for the interest, information and enlightenment for all [emphasis added] people of the
community the library serves" (Library Bill of Rights, n.p.). Tumuhairwe (2013) concurs stating
librarians, "are custodians of information and are mandated to provide this information equitably
to all library users with different cultural backgrounds" (p.l ). However, if one looks at the
collection numbers, the default to Whiteness (Sue, 2006) continues despite the policies and
librarians desire for diversity in the children's literature.

Sue argues how "whiteness is

considered to be normative and ideal and automatically confers dominance [for the] fair skinned
people in our society" (as cited in Lum, 2010, p. 52). The librarians usually choose books in
favor of the majority,
You know, I read about reviews, I look at our circulation data, and what I know what the
patrons are asking for. And we try to come up with a few things to balance it ... But
usually if it's an author I know circulates, or a character that people ask for, that is going

89

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
to get priority over something that has laurels. Because I know that it's worth our money
[because it will circulate] more than a lot of those books are, as sad as that is.
Thus, the inequality in the amount of children's books reflecting the dominant over the
marginalized groups continues.
Librarians claim the lack of circulation of the multicultural books also contributes to the
disparity. The diverse books that are provided are often weeded because they do not circulate
often enough. According to the collection development policies, "The goal of weeding is to
maintain a balance between standard classics and the currently popular while eliminating
incorrect information and worn or infrequently used materials. It is important to note that
weeding is always based on professional judgment." (Allegheny County Library Association
Countywide Collection Management Statement, p. 7). Lack of circulation leads to weeding so
the conflict within the policies and practice becomes expounded.

While the policies advocate

for multicultural literature, they also guide librarians to use their professional judgment and
discard what is not often used. While the collection development policies reference the ALA's
Bill of Rights which includes the "all" recommendation cited previously, ethnically diverse
books are not being represented adequately in the children's literature collections.
Key Learning Statement:
When library policy and practice are misaligned, the default to whiteness is often the outcome.

Amount and availability of multicultural children's literature. The amount of ethnic-

specific multicultural children's literature, as measured by award winners and honorees, varied
vastly depending on award and library. For example, the availability of the Coretta Scott King
Award honored and awarded books, a total of278 winners and honorees, ranges from one library
having a mere 14% to another library having the highest amount, 57% of the Coretta Scott King

90

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Award titles. The highest percentage of the Pura Belpre Award found was slightly higher than
the Coretta Scott King Award at 60%, while the lowest availability of the Pura Belpre was 18%.
The lowest percentage recorded was 2% for the Carter G Woodson award. One library held 90%
of the Arab American Book Award winners and honorees. The Arab American Book Award list
contained only 10 books; so that library possessed nine of the ten titles, while most, 22 of the 45
libraries, had only 20-30% or two or three titles. The librarian serving that library (which held
90%), wondered aloud about the collection she inherited.
I'm surprised at how many of the Arab American Book Awards my library has. And I
wonder if we haven't gone out of our way to pick those up, or was that established more
recently, or like? ... I'm kind of a newish librarian and I'm not as familiar with the
collection development policy at my library.
At the time of the focus group interview, she had been working at the library for only six months.
The tables and graphs presented in Appendix A display percentages of the awards'
availability in each library. The small spikes of higher availability are encouraging; however, the
overall amount of etlmic-specific, award winning multicultural children's literature is lacking.
One librarian scrutinized her library's holdings and community and commented
But what I find interesting is that we have like no Hispanic people. It's pretty much Black
and white in [name of town]. But we have more books for Tomas Rivera and Pura Belpre
than we do for Coretta Scott King. So that's interesting to me. I'm curious what led to
that.
In that community, African-American patrons looking for characters that look like themselves
have less of opportunity than the white or Hispanic and Latino patrons. Critical race theorist
Delgado and Stefancic (2012), state the hierarchical system which favors whites and results in

91

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
unequal ways of living for minorities, is part of the racism described as "the common, everyday
experience of most people of color in this country" (p. 7).
The lack of multicultural literature presented by the numbers and noticed by the librarians
displays how the majority of children's literature available in public libraries is still
predominately about white people. The low percentages displayed present evidence of the
previously stated default to whiteness.

This lack advantages the majority and adds to the

inequity of available resources for people of color, as described by critical race theorists.
Students' reading choices advantage white children and exclude children of color because
children of color are under-represented (Gangi 2008, Hughes-Hassell, Barkley, & Koehler,
2009). There should be more multicultural options available for our young readers, making
patrons' choices more equitable. The discrepancy illustrates the need for what is known in the
scholarly literature as mirrors and windows (Bishop, 1990). Multicultural children's literature
provide opportuuities
Some librarians know the importance of mirrors and window. One participant explains, "I
also insist on buying [books with] people of color... I do that to try to even it out because I think
you are- I don't know. They don't know what they need." A participant with high percentages of
multicultural children's book availability described her situation,
We're very wealthy and very white.... It's like we're compensating a bit like "Hey,
look! Let's put some of these books in front of people that you know, maybe wouldn't
think to pick that up." I think we're trying to be inclusive despite our demographics.
Additionally, other librarians enjoy highlighting culturally diverse books. Participants shared a
special program they executed, "We highlighted different cultures [each week]". Her colleague
added, "I thought it was the best one ever." She replied, "It was!"

92

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Other librarians were unfamiliar with the need for windows, citing their population
demographics, mostly white, presented less need for multicultural children's literature. "The
goal of a public library is not just to serve as a mirror for our community, but to serve as an open
door to the world" (Jansen, 2015; n.p.). Abdullahi (2007) describes librarians as "change agents
whose job is to facilitate the growth of knowledge and development of other human beings" (p.
456). Varied multicultural literature options can help children see value in others that may seem
different feel and help children feel valued when they see themselves in the books. As Estrin
(2015) states "children of all backgrounds will benefit from bonding with characters of diverse
races, ethnicities, religions ... " (n.p.).
During the focus group discussions, participants offered varied explanations for the
overall lack of multicultural literature. Librarians noted the varied sizes of library collections
across the county; smaller libraries have smaller collections. They also noted varied library
budgets as a factor contributing to the lack.
The libraries with more multicultural literature can easily share it with the other libraries.
ACLA' s interlibrary loan (ILL) allows patrons to get books from any library across Allegheny
County. ACLA does " ... support lifelong learning of a diverse public through collaboration,
cooperation and resource-sharing facilitated through the eiNetwork" (Allegheny County Library
Association Countywide Collection Management Statement, p. 3).
Key Learning Statements:
An inclusive attitude positively impacts a library's collection and multicultural book circulation.
Action is required to change collection and circulation practices.
The concept ofmirrors and windows can act as a beacon for librarians.

Relationships with schools. During the focus group sessions, librarians shared

93

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
information regarding their relationships with the local schools. Most relationships described by
the participants were positive and mutually supportive. Librarians visit the schools to participate
in events like career day and to do read-a-louds which promotes the library.

The better

relationships had support from the schools' leadership. Participants expressed the role of the
principal or the superintendent as being crucial to making connections to the teachers and
children via the schools. Schools without these connections can miss out on beneficial librarian
support.
The librarians support the teachers by supplying books to students and teachers, and
assisting them with assignments; specifically mentioned were assignments during Black History
Month and Asian Heritage Month.

One librarian discussed purchasing multicultural books

specifically for teachers stating, "I also work with a lot of the teachers in our school district
because they actually have a very restrictive budget. Our teachers have a more restrictive budget
than I do!" This type of collaboration benefits the children.
Gay (1975) contends "ethnic materials should be used to teach such fundamental skills as
reading, writing, calculating, and reasoning" (p. 179). Teachers employing culturally responsive
practices such as "environmental inclusion" and the "teaching of cultural figures" need authentic
multicultural book options (King, 2015a, n.p.). Similarly having better relationships may be
bring more patronage and circulation of multicultural children's literature.

Key Learning Statement:
Positive relationships with school leadership can foster healthy school - public library
relationships where librarians assist teachers with culturally responsive practices like using
multicultural literature.

94

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY

Challenges and opportunities in acquisition and use. The librarians revealed explicit
challenges in acquiring and using multicultural children's literature. One glaring problem is that
the participants only knew two of the eight ethnic awards included in the study. The only two
ethnic awards identified by the librarians included in the study are the same two listed among the
numerous other awards on the ALA web pages. While most librarians almost always purchase
the yearly winners for the Newbery and the Caldecott awards, the focus group librarians attested
they are unfamiliar with the ethnic-specific awards used here.
One librarian additionally stated,
Well, except for the Coretta Scott King Award I did not make any kind of effort to buy
any of these other awards yet. We seem to have some of them .... I wanted to know if we
got them-I don't want to say by accident, but I didn't know they were an award winner.
It is difficult to obtain quality, as indicated by being honored or awarded, multicultural literature
if the existence of ethnic-specific awards is unknown. Additionally, when discussing resources
for book selection, only a few librarians offered alternative sources to find diverse literature.
Some librarians assumed that multicultural children's books were only for patrons of
color. When discussing observations on the circulation of the multicultural books, one librarian
stated, "You can't look at what the little Chinese girl and the little Indian boy are going to take,
'Oh what are you reading today honey?"' Another librarian referenced the predominantly white
demographics of their community, "The demographics of this area do not promote a lot of
interest in books of those natures", as a reason for not having ample ethnic-specific award
winning and honored children's books. This suggests the librarians are unfamiliar with the
importance of the mirrors and windows concept.

95

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Other challenges in acquiring and using multicultural children's literature were more
implicit. Similar to weeding, in addition to using professional judgment, librarians use their
personal preference to make choices on what to add to their collections. All of the librarians
participating in this study identified themselves as female and white. This lack of staff diversity
may account for some of the lack of book diversity. Often the librarians choose what they think
is a good book. "I try to buy my books because I think they're a good book regardless of who the
main characters are".

Others choose what they think will circulate.

Personal views and

experience as well as implicit bias may be influencing them in choosing mirrors for themselves
and the majority over other choices.
Moreover, librarians' lack of cultural competence can inhibit the use of the diverse
literature. "Cultural competence is a highly developed ability to recognize the significance of
culture in one's own life and in the lives of others" (Montiel-Overall, 2009, p. 3). One librarian
cancelled her plans to read the latest Newbery and Caldecott winner, Last Stop on Market Street
to a group of children who reside in a local public housing community. She assumed the book
would be insulting because the characters got on a bus and went to a food pantry. She also
assumed it was true of them and they would be ashamed to ride bus or visit a food pantry.
Similarly, another librarian avoided suggesting books with Asian characters (the Ling and Ting
series by Grace Lin) because the child was also Asian. She feared offending the child and the
child's parents.

Both examples demonstrate librarians being uncomfortable interacting with

races different than their own. Both librarians would benefit from opportunities of training in
diversity or cultural competence.
There are additional opportunities, many offered by the participants in the study, to
increase the acquisition and use of multicultural children's literature.

96

and

#lOOOBlackGir!Books. Traditional resources used for book selection produce traditional results,
not enough diversity. Others mentioned using the list provided by the researcher. "Ethnicspecific youth literature awards are valuable tools that librarians can use to help identify books to
include in their collections" (Benton, 2015, p. 112).
The librarians in the focus groups also suggested adding more multicultural literature into
their reading. programs, summer reading lists, and to their in-house displays. One participant
proposed highlighting the diverse literature by hosting special programs with authors and
illustrators of diverse backgrounds. Additionally, when visiting the schools, the librarians can
also choose ethnically diverse literature to read-aloud to the students and suggest more
multicultural titles to teachers.
Another opportunity is to diversify the staff.

One librarian advocated for this

opportunity,
I think it's important, and I think this is important in like elementary education too is [to
hire] more nonwhite, non-female teachers and librarians. Because we've all heard them
say the best way to get a boy to read is for a boy to see another boy reading. So-l mean
we're all white women.
Key Learning Statements:
Overall, librarians are unaware with the ethnic-specific literary awards.
Lack ofstaff diversity can sway a deficiency of book diversity.
Librarians are unfamiliar with the mirrors and windows concept.

97

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Lack ofprofessional development in cultural competence can inhibit the use of multicultural
literature.
Implications for Policy and Practice

Implications drawn from the findings and interpretations are many. Revisions to the
collection development policies should be made in effort to correct the contradictions discussed
earlier in this chapter.

The policies also need to be more than words on paper in making

multicultural literature a priority. Furthermore, the librarians need to be familiar with and follow
the policies to ensure the collections "reflect the cultural, linguist and ethnic diversity of
Allegheny County" (Allegheny County Library Association Countywide Collection Management
Statement, p.l ).
Patrons should be able to enter their local library and easily find "mirrors and windows"
on the shelves. Librarians in the study agreed more ethnically diverse literature is needed; yet
many did not know how or where to get it citing constraints by vendors and resource lists that
lack multicultural options. Nevertheless, Crowley, Fountain, and Torres (2012) suggest seeking
out specialized publishers and contend "conscious decision[ s] to purchase these books,
consumers can demand materials from major publishers, forcing them to respond by creating the
number of books that feature characters of color" (p. 31 ). Thus, librarians need to use
multicultural resources for book selection. What's more is students should should find the
Another implication is that collaboration among the librarian professionals from the
different libraries across the county could boost success in the acquisition of multicultural
children's literature, especially if they take advantage of the brilliant opportunities expounded
during the focus groups, and certainly the resources. Some of ACLA librarians participating in

98

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
the study were familiar with many multicultural resources such as websites and blogs, while
others had no awareness. Sharing of reputable resources is crucial if things are to improve.
Additionally, some librarians proved more comfortable and adept at using ethnically
diverse children's books while others avoided utilizing it. Collaborating with one another would
prove beneficial in this aspect as well. The librarians included in this study providing services,
all identified as white women. One librarian displayed unawareness of her cultural insensitivity
stating stereotypical and inaccurate stories like Tikki Tikki Tembo are "such grand stories" with a
chuckle. Conversely, another librarian promptly removed Brother Eagle, Sister Sky from her
shelves because it also contained inaccuracies.

Collaborating with each other would be

beneficial for all.
This study found a need to increase the education and training of librarians in cultural
competency and diversity. Librarians would benefit from cultural competence training and
learning the related culturally responsive teaching tenets as well. "There is a critical need to
develop cultural competence among LIS professionals to address social, linguistic, and academic
needs of culturally diverse individuals who represent a population most in need of library
services" (Montiel-Overall, 2009a, p.199).

Training in cultural competence is imperative

because as Montiel-Overall (2009b) referencing Peterson (1996) states
few library and information science (LIS) professionals are prepared to deal with the
enormous responsibility of transforming libraries into institutions which truly meet the
needs of diverse populations since particularly since the community served are generally
ethnically and culturally different from those providing services (p.1 ).
"Cultural competence guidelines do not exist for the LIS profession" (Montiel-Overall, 2009b,
p. 1) yet Montiel-Overall' s offers a framework presented in her article Cultural Competence: A

99

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
Conceptual Framework for Library and Information Science Professionals. ACLA offers regular
professional development trainings on varied topics such as battle of the books or autism
spectrum programming, and offers quarterly youth services meetings. These professional
meetings would provide suitable opportunities for collaboration and cultural competence
training.
Moreover, having specified checklists of best practices could assist ACLA's librarians in
ensuring the ample acquisition and unrestricted use of multicultural children's literature. Many,
if not most librarians purposefully choose and use the mainstream award winners such as the
Caldecott and Newbery Awards. Having a prescribed course of action including highlighting
these ethnic-specific awarded books, will allow more mirrors for today' s diverse patrons.

Part

of that course of action could include community involvement in selection and promotion.
Having a diverse group of community members reviewing, discussing, brainstorming can also
assist librarians.
Another implication is the vendors, which supply the libraries with the bulk of their
children's collections, need to offer more multicultural choices. Librarians need to demand more
multicultural literature from the vendors and the vendors need to supply it. In addition, library
directors of the libraries need to condone purchases from sources outside of the convenient
vendors. Some librarians have the freedom to purchase from online sites and some do not.
Lastly, the American Library Association must recognize and support the use of etlmic
resources since librarians rely on the ALA for information such as news, events, and advocacy
resources and more. Focus group participants only knew two awards included in this study;
these are the only two the ALA has on their website. The ALA needs to promote these awards as
they do the others children's book awards. Adding the ethnic-specific children's book awards to

100

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
the ALA websites, like their Book & Media Awards page, will increase visibility and awareness.
Because the librarians were unfamiliar with the ethnic-specific book awards, providing books,
"for the interest, information and enlightenment for all [emphasis added] people of the
community" (n.p.) as the Library Bill of Rights suggests, proves more difficult and unlikely.
The ALA should also focus on their
"Changing demographics globally require rethinking and retooling libraries to meet the needs of
library users by creating multicultural institutions represented by culturally competent
professionals" (Montiel-Overall, 2009, p.lO).
Recommendations for Further Research

This study investigated the availability of awarded and honored multicultural children's
books in ACLA libraries and librarians' perceptions of the challenges and opportunities related
to the attainment and utilization of such literature. A future study could explore the circulation
statistics of the available multicultural titles, including the use of inter-library loans of the books,
and interview library patrons for a more in-depth understanding. A replication of this study
could investigate the availability of awarded and honored multicultural children's literature in
elementary school libraries or school reading curriculums or even on the shelves of local
bookstores. A parallel study could investigate possible connections regarding achievement in
schools near community libraries abundant in multicultural children's literature. A similar study
comparing the availability percentages of the ethnic-specific awards to the availability
percentages of the more established, mainstream awards, such as the Caldecott and Newbery,
could prove worthy. Research could be conducted to examine the effects of library budget and
library size in relation to the amount of multicultural children's books and promotion of those
books. Scholars may be interested in examining librarians' cultural competence training, and if

101

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
that correlates to higher amounts of multicultural children's literature available in the collections.
Statistical analysis on the multicultural titles included in the review journals employed by
librarians when purchasing books could be another possibility. Results of a library's community
survey could better illuminate issues related to patrons' attitudes and preferences and the
collection of that library.
Limitations

The researcher acknowledges limitations in this case study. The researcher recognizes
her potential biases and remained objective and conscious of them throughout the study. All
sixteen focus group librarians self-identified as female and white; all 45 libraries were in
Allegheny County.

This small sampling presents a lack in generalizability for this study.

Moreover, this research provided the availability of specific award-winning and honored
multicultural books in ACLA libraries. It is most probable additional multicultural children's
books that have not been awarded, exist in the collections of the surveyed libraries.
Summary of the Chapter

This final chapter discussed pertinent concepts gained from the study's findings and
presented key learning statements. In regards to children's literature collections, when library
policies and practices are misaligned, the default to whiteness is often an outcome. Collection
development policies need to be more than words on paper in making multicultural literature a
priority. While the ACLA librarians agree multicultural books should be plentiful in the
children's and youth collections, there is a lack of ethnic-specific, award-winning and honored
multicultural children's literature in the majority of ACLA libraries. A lack in staff diversity
(All focus group participants were white women.) can influence a lack of book diversity, as
evidenced by the views of the all-white, female participants. Furthermore, lack of cultural

102

MULTICULTURAL CHILDREN'S LITERATURE: A CASE STUDY
competence training can inhibit the acquisition and use of multicultural children's literature.
Overall, librarian participants are unfamiliar with the ethnic-specific literary awards, also with
the mirrors and windows concept. Multicultural children's books, like a mirror can reflect
culture and help children identity with their culture. Like a window, it allows children to peer
through and view other cultures.

Subsequently, librarians would benefit from cultural

competence training as well as collaboration with each other so patrons are able to enter their
local library and easily find abundant "mirrors and windows" on the shelves.
Conclusion of the Study

This qualitative case study investigated the availability of 746 award-winning and
honored titles from eight ethnic-specific children's literature awards, in the collections of
Allegheny County Library Association (ACLA) libraries and examined librarian perceptions
regarding the acquisition and use of such books using focus group interviews. This study also
surveyed ACLA collection development policies. While the collection development policies
advocated for library collections to "reflect the cultural, linguist and ethnic diversity of
Allegheny County" (Allegheny County Library Association Countywide Collection Management
Statement, p.l ), many librarians expressed difficulty in obtaining and circulating multicultural
children's literature. Even with the difficulty, librarians agree more multicultural children's
literature should not only be plentiful, but also promoted in their libraries' juvenile collections.
The lack of multicultural children's literature is indicative of the social disparities providing for
the dominant populations and brings to question the role of race and racism, though perhaps
unintentional, in the perpetuation of disparities between the dominant and marginalized groups.
"Multicultural children's literature can affirm cultural and social identities" (Crowley, Fountain,
& Torres, 2012, p. 28). "For children who are white, these books offer different perspectives

from their world" (Boyd, Causey and Gaida, p. 380, 2015). Today's diverse demographics
"require rethinking and retooling libraries to meet the needs of library users by creating
multicultural institutions represented by culturally competent professionals" (Montiel-Overall,
2009, p.lO). Because today's library users are more ethnically diverse, it is imperative that all
children experience mirrors and windows in the books available to them.
