Abstract
Composition Students’ Research Experiences at a Rural Community College:
A Qualitative Case Study
Elena B. Heilman, Ed.D.
Drexel University, May 2014
Chairperson: Holly Carpenter

This qualitative case study investigated community college students’ experiences
with conducting research for academic research papers in transfer-level composition
courses at a rural community college. Little information exists on how rural community
college students enrolled in transfer-level composition classes approach the process of
searching for sources for an academic research paper. Neither instructors nor librarians
know if existing theoretical models match their students’ experiences, what their
students’ academic research paper processes are, how students choose and evaluate
information sources, or what major challenges and frustrations they encounter. The
following research questions were posed: 1) What are the Yuba College English 1A
students’ research experiences when creating academic research papers? 2) What
processes do students follow when conducting academic research? 3) How do students
choose and evaluate their sources? 4) What challenges and frustrations might they
encounter?
This study was informed by information literacy theories, existing models of
information-seeking behavior, and previous research on student use of online resources
for research. The researcher collected 33 reflective essays from three sections of the
English 1A class during Spring 2013, and conducted two focus group interviews with
ix

four participants each and three individual interviews during Fall 2013. Upon coding and
analyzing data for emerging themes and recurring ideas, the following three major
themes emerged: 1) Research Process, 2) Library and Help, and 3) Mental Process. The
results were as follows: 1) Students struggled with finding, evaluating, and using sources
for their research papers; 2) Respondents followed an established process in order to
complete their research assignments; and 3) Study participants did not seek help
throughout their research process. Recommendations for practical action are made for
librarians, instructors, and community colleges. The study concludes with
recommendations for future research to include other composition courses taught by
other instructors, other courses, and urban community colleges.

Chapter 1: Introduction to the Research
This study focuses on understanding community college students’ experiences
while conducting research for academic papers in transfer-level composition courses. A
case study approach is used to understand what steps or processes students follow, what
challenges they encounter, and how they evaluate their potential and final cited sources.
The goal of this study is to better inform information literacy instruction at the
community college level.
This chapter begins with a statement of the problem to be researched followed by
a description of the purpose and significance of the problem. It then describes research
questions and conceptual frameworks of relevant literature streams which formed the
basis for this case study. The chapter closes with a discussion of researcher assumptions
and the limitations of the study.
Introduction to the Problem
One of the reasons undergraduate students enrolled in composition courses are
assigned research papers is to gain information literacy and critical thinking skills
transferable to future academic and personal tasks (Corder, 1981; Norgaard, 2003; Perry,
1970). As a result of these research experiences, students are expected to learn how to
locate and evaluate academic sources, as well as how successfully to search for
information. The Association of Academic and Research Libraries (ACRL) includes
these competencies among the skills of information literate individuals (Association of
College and Research Libraries, 2013). According to a widespread information literacy
definition used in the library science field, the information literate person “must be able

2
to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use
effectively the needed information” (American Library Association, 1989).
Promoting lifelong learning and critical thinking skills is among core missions of
community colleges as well as other higher education institutions (Cohen & Brawer,
2009; Snavely, 2008). One of the stated objectives of general education in community
colleges, identified as early as 1952, is the ability to “use methods of critical thinking for
the solution of problems and for the discrimination among values” (Cohen & Brawer,
2009, p. 375). The Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges in
California (ACCJC) created a similar list of general education objectives in 2001, one of
which is “the capability to become productive workers and lifelong learners: skills
include oral and written communication, scientific and quantitative reasoning, critical
analysis/logical thinking, acquisition of knowledge, computer literacy, and ability to
work with others” (Cohen & Brawer, 2009, p. 375). Clearly, community colleges
consider teaching critical thinking and lifelong learning to be two of their central
missions.
The regional accrediting agencies are influential forces endorsing information
literacy. ACCJC, for example, uses information literacy instruction as one of its
accreditation standards, ensuring that information literacy activities are included in
learning outcomes assessments and institutional reviews. ACCJC Standard IIC1B
mandates that in order to be accredited, institutions should provide “ongoing instruction
for users of library and other learning support services so that students are able to develop
skills in information competency” (Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior

3
Colleges, 2012). This pressure from accrediting commissions helps to keep community
college administrators and faculty focused on information literacy instruction.
Conley (2009) conducted extensive research on college readiness for the
Education Policy Improvement Center. He identified a variety of student success skills,
also called “key cognitive strategies” (p. 5), which have been consistently recognized as
being vital for college students. These cognitive capabilities include reasoning, analysis,
interpretation, and problem solving. These skills, when coupled with another set of skills,
understanding available college resources, positively contribute to student success.
Promoting critical thinking skills, or “the habits of mind” are vital to student success
(California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office, 2012, p. 29).
Information literacy is considered a component of critical thinking, and
individuals who are able to find and critically think about information are likely to be
more successful in college and as lifelong learners. One can see a strong connection
between information literacy and student success as promoted by the California
Community Colleges Student Success Task Force. Learning more about student
experiences with academic research may help shed light on the levels of information
literacy achievement among transfer-level community college students.
Statement of the Problem to Be Researched
While both empirical studies and theoretical models exist on how university
undergraduate and graduate students approach the research process for writing an
academic research paper, little information is available on how rural community college
students enrolled in transfer-level composition classes approach the process of searching
for sources for an academic research paper. Few if any studies have examined whether

4
existing theoretical models match rural community college students’ experiences, what
these students’ academic research paper processes are, how students choose and evaluate
information sources, or what major challenges and frustrations they encounter. Without
this knowledge, true innovation in teaching and library practices, in the rural community
college context, is likely to be limited (Jacobs & Jacobs, 2009; McGuinness, 2006; Tuttle
& McKinzie, 2007).
Purpose and Significance of the Problem
Purpose
The purpose of this case study is to explore the experiences of rural community
college students conducting research for academic papers for a transfer-level composition
course. The researcher sought to uncover deep subjective accounts of these student
experiences. Study of this process will assist both rural community college librarians and
English instructors in becoming better able to support students in their research
processes.
The study is grounded in information literacy definitions, existing information
literacy models, and previous empirical research on students’ use of online resources.
Previous research on student online research behavior was extended to include a rural
California community college district. Findings might provide insights to educators about
the trajectories of students’ research projects as described by study participants
themselves. Additionally, given the statewide discussion on student success and student
learning outcomes, the study findings might add valuable information to both
conversations.

5
Significance of the Problem
An existing body of literature on student use of online resources suggests that
students prefer using free websites to library databases, considering free Internet search
engines faster and more convenient (Bell, 2004; Biddix, Chung, & Park, 2011; Corbett,
2010; Fast & Campbell, 2005; Griffith & Brophy, 2005; Judd & Kennedy, 2011;
Williams, 2006). Williams (2006) in a study of over 3300 participants found that 80% of
students started their research process by using Google, compared to 6% using the
library. Judd and Kennedy (2011) found that medical students lacked information literacy
skills causing them to use unsophisticated Google and Wikipedia searches resulting in
poor quality sources. On the other hand, a number of studies report that students use
library databases on a regular basis (Gabridge, Gaskell, & Stout, 2008; Head &
Eisenberg, 2010; Thompson, 2007). However, most research findings demonstrated that
students prefer convenience to quality evidenced by choosing to use web sites instead of
library databases (Bell, 2004; Biddix et al., 2011; Fast & Campbell, 2005; Griffith &
Brophy, 2005; Judd & Kennedy, 2011; Williams, 2006). These findings concur with
Marchionini’s (1992) suggestion that “humans will seek the path of least cognitive
resistance” (p. 156).
Despite an abundance of literature on students’ information literacy skills, the
majority of researchers have studied four-year college and university students. Few
studies of community college students have been produced, none of which describe rural
California community college students (Karas & Green, 2007; O'Brien, 2011;
Zaborowski, 2008). Transfer-level composition courses are pivotal in that many of these
students will be transferring to universities or entering the workforce shortly after taking

6
this course. Their level of preparedness for effectively completing future research papers
after taking an English 1A course is indicative of their true preparedness for universitylevel undergraduate research, as well as their preparedness as lifelong learners in the
work setting.
Past research samples have been drawn from urban districts, high school or
university campuses, and college campuses in other states. However, little research has
focused on community college samples, particularly rural community colleges in
California. Community college student populations typically differ from students at 4year colleges and universities in a number of ways: there are more part-time, older, first
generation, and immigrant students at community colleges than other institutions of
higher education (Cohen & Brawer, 2009). The researcher seeks to extend existing
studies to include a rural California community college district. Thus a study of
California rural community college students’ information literacy skills, examining the
words and stories of the students themselves, will provide a valuable contribution to
existing literature.
Research Questions
This study seeks to answer the following questions:
1. What are the Yuba College English 1A students’ research experiences

when creating academic research papers?
2. What processes do students follow when conducting academic research?
3. How do students choose and evaluate their sources?
4. What challenges and frustrations might they encounter?

7
The Conceptual Framework
Researcher Stances and Experiential Base
I have been employed as an academic librarian at Yuba College for over five
years. My responsibilities include assisting all students at Yuba College to conduct
coursework-related research. I have also worked closely with many English 1A students
who have to complete research for their academic research papers. Additionally, at
instructors’ requests I provide library and Internet research sessions.
My philosophical assumptions are grounded in the epistemological approach.
Creswell (2007) views the relationship between the researcher and his or her research as
interconnected rather than independent. The researcher experiences “closeness” instead
of “distance” from the researched (p. 247). I anticipated that my role as a practicing
librarian would mix with students’ views, and I needed to bracket my own assumptions
and perceptions.
Social constructivists rely heavily on the views of their study participants
(Creswell, 2007). As a social constructivist, I attempt to “understand the world in which I
live and work” (Creswell, 2007, p. 20). Therefore, the fact that this study is conducted at
a research site where I have been employed over the past five years is entirely
appropriate.
A qualitative approach is a necessity for uncovering deep subjective accounts of
student research experiences. A qualitative approach is typical for social constructivists
(Creswell, 2007). As an academic librarian, I believe it is important to gain insight into
the experiences of students conducting research for academic papers. Qualitative studies
focusing on a specific issue are instrumental case studies as they “serve the purpose of

8
illuminating a particular issue” (Creswell, 2008, p. 476). To gain an in-depth
understanding of students’ research experiences, I incorporated various forms of data
collection, including individual and focus group interviews, students’ reflective essays,
and the researcher journal.
I believe that information literacy is a vital skill students need to develop while in
college. While many definitions of information literacy can be found in the literature, I
favor the traditional librarian definition of information literacy as the ability “to recognize
when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively
the needed information” (American Library Association, 1989, para.1). In line with much
existing research, I believe that information literacy makes lifelong learning and
academic and professional success more likely for students to achieve. However, I also
believe that student voices are not always heard in academic studies related to
information literacy and believe that really hearing these voices will allow for deeper
understanding of student learning and its outcomes.
Conceptual Framework
This study is informed by the following research streams: information literacy
definitions, information seeking models, and student use of online resources (Figure 1).
The first two streams are theoretical, and the third stream synthesizes previous empirical
studies related to student use of online resources.

Figure 1: A conceptual framework: theory and previous research

In order to understand how students are demonstrating information literacy skills
based on their research paper experiences, one needs to be aware of the large number of
sometimes contradictory information literacy definitions. Various disciplines and even
professionals within the same discipline differ in their understanding of what information
literacy is, adding further complexity to information literacy and information seeking
research. Existing theoretical models of users’ information-seeking behaviors and
previous empirical research on student use of online resources may help to further inform
this study. This project aims to contribute to a body of empirical literature on student
information literacy skills by studying academic research paper experiences of students

10
enrolled in a rural community college transfer-level composition course. For these
reasons, these three research streams have been chosen for this research project.
The existing body of literature on student use of online resources is available and
relevant to this research. Some studies find that college students choose to use free
Internet websites instead of library databases citing convenience and familiarity with free
search engines (Bell, 2004; Biddix et al., 2011; Fast & Campbell, 2005; Griffith &
Brophy, 2005; Head, 2013; Judd & Kennedy, 2011; Thompson, 2003; Williams, 2006).
Williams (2006) states that 80% of students started their research process by using
Google, compared to 6% using the library. Judd and Kennedy (2011) find that medical
students lack information literacy skills causing them to use unsophisticated Google and
Wikipedia searches resulting in poor quality sources. On the other hand, a number of
studies report that students use library databases on a regular basis (Blackman, 2003;
Thompson, 2007), while others add that students are satisfied with their library use and
experiences (Avdic & Eklund, 2010; Blackman, 2003; Koohang & Ondracek, 2005;
McLean & Dew, 2004; Oulanov, 2008).
The term “information literacy” is multifaceted and has numerous definitions,
both complementary and conflicting (Kerr, 2010). Information literacy is sometimes
described as a set of skills, or as a critical thinking capacity, or a learning outcome, while
others define it as a thinking and feeling process, or a lifelong competency. Behaviorist
and constructivist approaches to education offer conflicting interpretations of information
literacy. According to the behaviorist approach, information literacy instruction focuses
on information finding procedures as well as information sources choices. Breivik and
Gee (1989), Doyle (1992), and Zurkowski (1974) are among the prominent advocates of

11
this framework, and Dixon-Thomas (2012) confirms that the majority of practicing
librarians subscribe to this approach to information literacy instruction. However, a
common criticism of the behaviorist approach is a process-based, constructivist
framework for information literacy. Kelly (1963) introduced the constructivist
framework, and its advocates in the field of information science include Kuhlthau (2004),
Marcum (2002), Norgaard (2003), and Simmons (2005), among others. The present study
was informed by both the behaviorist and the constructivist frameworks.
The relevance of information behavior models is explained by Wilson (1999), who
defines an information behavior model as “a framework for thinking about a problem
[that] may evolve into a statement of the relationship among theoretical prepositions” (p.
250). Over the last several decades researchers have been attempting to understand users’
information seeking behaviors through the use of models. The “information behavior”
concept is rooted in the 1960’s research on users and information use, and dozens of user
behavior theories have been developed over the last two decades across several
disciplines (Pettigrew & McKechnie, 2001). Some of the commonly used information
seeking models are as follows: Bates’ Berry Picking model (1989), Dervin’s SenseMaking Approach (2003), Ellis’ Model of Information Seeking Behavior (1989),
Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process (ISP) (2004), Taylor’s Levels of Need (1962),
and Wilson’s Model of Information Behavior (1999). Chapter 2 of this study compare the
aforementioned information seeking models.

Use
“The way that customers interact with library” (Hernon, 2010, p. 36).
Assumptions and Limitations
The researcher assumed that study participants would answer interview questions
truthfully. Because students would just have completed their research projects, the
researcher also assumed that students would still remember their experiences conducting
research. Additionally, she assumed that students would complete their in-class reflective
essay assignments honestly without trying to anticipate what types of answers the
researcher would wish to receive.
This study has four main limitations. a) This study is limited to a small group of
community college students enrolled in transfer-level English composition courses in one
community college. b) Multiple teaching styles may result in different research projects
assigned to English 1A students. For example, some English instructors require the use of
library databases, while others do not impose such a requisite. Therefore, to control the
variable of the teacher’s assignment requirements potentially dictating students’ online
research processes, only course sections using identical assignment requirements were
used for this study. In other words, the population and sample choices limit the
generalizability and transferability of this study. c) Student reflective essays were
collected based on a purposeful sample. The researcher collected these essays based on
pre-arranged class visits to a computer lab to write these essays during assigned class

15
time. d) Finally, this project was led by the librarian with whom students may have
worked throughout the semester to conduct research. Such assumed preexisting
relationships may have impacted participants’ reported responses.
Summary
The purpose of this case study is to gain an in-depth understanding of how rural
community college students enrolled in a transfer-level English composition course
conduct research for academic papers. This study examined what processes (or steps)
students follow when researching for their academic papers, what challenges they
encounter, and how they evaluate their potential and final sources of information. An
attempt was made to compare research findings to existing models of information seeking
behavior in an effort to discover which (if any) of these models match the study
participants’ experiences, and where they may diverge.

16
Chapter 2: The Literature Review
Introduction to Chapter 2
Composition students are often required to write research papers to develop
critical thinking and information literacy skills. As a result of completing these
assignments, students may learn how to search for credible information successfully and
how to locate and evaluate their sources. According to a common definition, the
information literate person “must be able to recognize when information is needed and
have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information”
(American Library Association, 1989, para. 1).
The problem this study seeks to explore is that neither librarians nor instructors
may know exactly how students complete their research assignments. While composition
instructors are able to see final research papers, giving them the ability to judge the
quality of cited sources, students’ academic research processes remain largely hidden
from educators. Teachers and librarians may have little knowledge of whether their
students are exhibiting behaviors characteristic of information literate individuals while
composing academic papers.
A number of information-seeking models have been developed during recent
decades, attempting to describe and understand user information behaviors (Dervin,
2003; Ellis, 1989; Kuhlthau, 2004). Additionally, a body of empirical studies on students’
use of online resources suggests both common and contradictory themes about the ways
students seek information and conduct research (Avdic & Eklund, 2010; Biddix et al.,
2011; Judd & Kennedy, 2011). However, little research addresses rural community
college students, particularly those enrolled in transfer-level composition courses.

17
Therefore, this study seeks to contribute to existing theoretical models and empirical
studies by including rural California community college students.
Literature Review
To better understand students’ experiences of conducting research for academic
papers, this study is conducted in the context of three areas of research. Therefore, this
literature review explores information literacy definitions, highlights information-seeking
models, and reviews previous empirical studies on the student use of online resources.
Theoretical streams on information literacy definitions and information-seeking models
give richer context to the existing empirical studies on student information-seeking
behavior. Thus all three streams are discussed in this review.
The researcher searched for relevant studies in a range of resources related to
education and library science, including ERIC, Education Research Complete, Library
Literature & Information Science Full Text, EbscoHost, and ProQuest Dissertations and
Theses. Additionally, Google Scholar and Web of Knowledge were utilized to expand
possible findings. Due to the rapid technological changes in the library field, only studies
published during the last ten years have been included in the review of the student use of
online resources research stream.
Information Literacy Definitions
Librarians have led information literacy efforts over the past 40 years, and the
majority of information literacy definitions come from the library and information
science field (Saunders, 2010). The term “information literacy” is complex and has
multiple complementary as well as contradictory definitions based on varied theoretical
frameworks, values, empirical studies, and professional practice (Kerr, 2010).

18
Information literacy has been described as a set of skills or abilities, a process, a
critical thinking capacity, and a life-long competency, among other definitions. Some
argue that information literacy is too broad to have a single meaningful definition
(Marcum, 2002). Sometimes information literacy is viewed as a general term for a variety
of literacies, such as technological literacy, visual literacy, digital literacy, media literacy,
numerical literacy, and cultural literacy (Bawden, 2001; Bundy, 2004). As educators
consider learning through different theoretical lenses, they tend to define information
literacy based on pre-established frameworks, such as behaviorist and constructivist
approaches.
Behaviorist approach. The oldest and most traditional definition of information
literacy in the library field stems from the behaviorist approach, which defines
information literacy as a set of skills students need to master (Grassian & Kaplowitz,
2009). The behavioral theory of education, popularized by B. F. Skinner, asserts that
learning is rooted in specific, clear, and quantifiable activities and rules (Leonard, 2002).
In the information literacy context, behaviorism focuses on procedures for finding
information as well as information sources. Librarians educate students on finding
accurate sources, using them correctly, and following the acceptable order in which to
use those sources (Bowles-Terry, Davis, Holliday, & O'Connor, 2010). For instance,
students may be taught that when conducting research they should refer to general
reference encyclopedias or databases first, followed by books and e-books, and then
journal articles. At the same time, librarians may discourage students from using
Wikipedia or other non-scholarly sources. When Bowles-Terry et al. (2010) examined 43

19
information literacy tutorials created between 2004 and 2009, they found that checklists
are commonly used to help students with source evaluation criteria.
In her mixed-method study of academic librarians’ perceptions and practices
regarding information literacy, Dixon-Thomas (2012) confirmed that librarians typically
teach information literacy based on the traditional behaviorist approach to information
literacy. She used the Delhi method in her study of 21 professional librarians in a
Southeastern college system. Dixon-Thomas (2012) found that librarians typically teach
information literacy by utilizing library orientations, private information literacy sessions,
and for-credit courses. These approaches are commonly associated with traditional
teaching based on the behaviorist definition of information literacy. She adds that
librarian-faculty collaboration and the use of current technologies are imperative for
successful information literacy teaching.
Professional associations in the library field have demonstrated leadership in
studying the concept and advocating for information literacy. Typically, they use the
behaviorist approach to information literacy. The most well-known definition was created
by Breivik for the American Library Association in 1989. According to this definition,
the information literate person “must be able to recognize when information is needed
and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information”
(American Library Association, 1989, para. 1).
Zurkowski (1974) is credited for introducing this information literacy concept. He
wrote that “people trained in the application of information resources to their work can be
called information literates. They have learned techniques and skills for utilizing the wide

20
range of information tools as well as primary sources in molding information solutions to
their problems” (p. 6).
Doyle (1992) completed a study that led to the dominant definition of information
literacy, commonly used by librarians today. The purpose of her study was to create a
comprehensive definition and outcomes measures for information literacy. Doyle (1992)
used the Delphi technique for her research. The Delphi technique is a structured
communication method, where the experts answer questionnaires in multiple rounds.
Doyle’s (1992) study participants were individuals from 46 national business,
government, and educational organizations. The generated list of ten information literacy
attributes and learning outcome measures is still commonly used in the library field.
According to Doyle (1992), an information literate person:
1. Recognizes the need for information.
2. Recognizes that accurate and complete information is the basis for intelligent

decision making.
3. Formulates questions based on information needs.
4. Identifies potential sources of information.
5. Develops successful search strategies.
6. Accesses sources of information including computer based and other

technologies.
7. Evaluates information.
8. Organizes information for practical application.
9. Integrates new information into an existing body of knowledge.
10. Uses information in critical thinking and problem solving (p.2).

21
A common criticism of teaching information literacy as a set of skills is that it
such an approach ignores research as a process (Bowles-Terry et al., 2010; Fister, 1993;
Kuhlthau, 2004; Norgaard, 2003). Both Fister (1993) and Norgaard (2003) argue that
when librarians teach information literacy as a set of skills, they contradict what
composition instructors are attempting to teach, confusing students and reducing
information literacy to superficial learning.
Fister (1993) posits that differences exist between librarian and composition
teachers’ approaches regarding the research process. While teachers are concerned with
rhetoric, or constructing knowledge, librarians are interested in how to find information,
or information retrieval. Fister (1993) asserts that librarians may confuse students by
advocating that the research process is merely finding correct sources. She explains that
librarians would be more effective if instead of solely teaching information retrieval, they
would situate research in a rhetorical context. Additionally, she describes ways for
librarians to use this approach.
Norgaard (2003) states that a process approach to information literacy should be
used in lieu of viewing information literacy as a research paper citation compilation
effort. He emphasizes the importance of engagement and partnerships between
composition instructors and librarians and criticizes a traditional product-oriented model
of rhetoric and information literacy instruction. Norgaard (2003) argues that processoriented information literacy, situated in composition and rhetoric, would help students
develop more relevant literacy skills. These abilities would then be applicable to a wide
range of intellectual activities.

22
Marcum (2002) also critiques the behaviorist information-processing theory used
as the foundation of current information literacy initiatives. He argues for the centrality of
the learner experience and thinking in learning theory. Additionally, Marcum (2002)
describes various types of literacies separate from information literacy, such as visual
literacy, digital literacy, and technological literacy. He criticizes existing information
literacy models, promoting “learning sociotechnical fluency” instead (p. 1). By
“sociotechnical fluency” he means a combination of technical skills, social awareness,
and information retrieval capacity related to workplace competencies. Marcum (2002)
concludes that information literacy cannot be sufficiently achieved or measured in its
current definition, because this definition is too broad. At the same time, he argues that
information literacy practice should be focused on technological literacy rather than textbased literacy.
Another common criticism of the behaviorist information literacy model is that it
does not promote critical thinking (Kautzman, 1996; Simmons, 2005). Simmons (2005)
criticizes the behaviorist definition of information literacy adopted by ACRL in 1989,
arguing that this definition externalizes knowledge placing it externally to the learner.
Instead, Simmons (2005) promotes the “critical information literacy” conception, based
on Paolo Freire’s (2000) “critical pedagogy” concept (p. 299). Kautzman (1996)
examines the role of library research instruction within English composition courses. She
advocates for critical thinking skills to be incorporated into the research skills taught in
composition courses. Among other principles, she promotes Deborah Fink’s (1991) Ten
Questions for evaluating and choosing library sources. Based on her reflections on the
effectiveness of her own research sessions, as well as writing theories, Kautzman

23
advocates for team teaching between librarians and composition instructors to teach
critical thinking and research writing.
Constructivist approach. Constructivists believe that knowledge is created in the
learner’s mind, rather than being transferred from a teacher to a student (Grassian &
Kaplowitz, 2009). This approach speculates that students’ prior knowledge forms their
information seeking and thus their information literacy. From this vantage point,
information literacy is seen as a recursive process of applying strategies rather than
through mechanical rules and procedures (Bowles-Terry et al., 2010).
Bowles-Terry et al. (2010) describe a collaborative approach to information
literacy and writing between librarians and writing instructors at Utah State University.
Participants of the study included students in the English 1010 (Introduction to Writing)
and the English 2010 (Intermediate Writing) courses. Bowles-Terry et al. (2010)
highlight their collaboration efforts, which included creating common learning goals,
writing lesson plans, conducting observations, and co-analyzing final student projects and
reflective essays. Bowles-Terry et al. (2010) concluded that successful collaboration
between librarians and writing instructors for teaching information literacy is needed and
possible if both writing theories and information literacy theories are incorporated into
the class assignments. They suggest that students benefit when the library instruction is
expanded beyond being a basic skill to look up articles (a behaviorist approach), to
becoming an inquiry process that facilitates learning (a constructivist approach). They
share Norgaard’s (2003) criticism of traditional approaches to information literacy, such
as one-shot bibliographic instruction sessions, web evaluation checklists, and step-by-

24
step instructions to conducting research. Norgaard (2003) calls these models “ghosts,”
and Bowles-Terry et al. (2010) agree with this statement. They hypothesize that the
aforementioned library “ghosts” support the notion that research means finding correct
information and reporting it back to the instructor (Bowles-Terry et al., 2010).
Kuhlthau (2004) is at the forefront of constructivist thinking about information
literacy. She describes information literacy as a process of constructing knowledge. She
posits that students should be taught the process rather than knowledge. In Kuhlthau’s
(2004) model, students design their questions, modify these questions, utilize a variety of
sources and share their newfound knowledge with other students. They learn by creating
meaning from the research process experiences, which is teaching them information
literacy. In her critique of traditional information literacy concepts, Kuhlthau (2004)
writes, “Information is viewed as a thing or product to be given out, the right answer and
the right source, rather than as an impetus for learning or changing constructs” (Kuhlthau,
2004, p. 3).” Kuhlthau (2004) claims that uncertainty is a common occurrence during the
information search process, which presents opportunities for intervention for instructors
and librarians.
Stock’s (2008) research found that students’ own definitions of information
literacy do not align with Kuhlthau’s (2004) process model. Stock (2008) offers a
qualitative study of Iowan community college students’ experiences and their
understanding of information literacy concepts. Study participants finished a minimum of
24 semester hours of classes and either completed or were enrolled in an English
Composition II course. Additionally, each study participant submitted two research

25
papers, one from an English Composition II course and the other one from a discipline
course, for document analysis. Through interviewing seven students at Des Moines Area
Community College and analyzing student papers, Stock (2008) sought to identify
individual definitions of information literacy. She found that students did not think of
information literacy as a process; instead, they defined it as avoiding plagiarism and
being able to identify different types of resources.
Webber and Johnson (2000) explain behaviorist and constructivist approaches to
information literacy, and provide an overview of seven so-called conceptions of
information literacy. They argue that information literacy is more than a set of skills
meant to be taught using “tick the box” approach promoted in the ACRL Information
Literacy Standards. Webber and Johnson (2000) apply two information literacy models to
business students in a credit course at the University of Strathclyde. This is a
phenomenological study exploring students’ understanding of information literacy.
Findings suggest that during the course students switched from thinking information
literacy was about finding sources and using computer technology to information literacy
being a part of the psychological process. This study highlights students’ changing
perceptions of information literacy and applies different information models to gain a
better understanding of the research process.
Jacobs and Jacobs (2009) describe a new model of information literacy instruction
within the first-year composition program at University of Windsor in Canada. Their
instruction model is based on a learning community concept, where the collaboration
between librarians and English instructors continues throughout the course. The authors

26
criticize the traditional librarian approach to teaching information literacy, promoting a
self-reflective iterative process instead. Jacobs and Jacobs (2009) assert, “Like effective
writing, effective research does not happen in just one sitting but involves iterative
processes such as revision, reworking, rethinking, and above all, reflection” (p. 72).
Throughout their interactions with students, librarians focused on the research process
rather than research tools. Jacobs and Jacobs (2009) explain that research process should
be transparent to make instruction and guidance possible through this process. When only
the final research paper receives the instructor’s attention, important learning and
teaching opportunities are missed.
Critical thinking and life-long learning approaches to information literacy.
According to some, critical thinking is the foundation of information literacy (Kerr,
2010). Brevik (2005) writes that “information literacy is a kind of critical thinking ability;
often the terms are used interchangeably” (p. 23). Tsui (2002) also finds a strong
connection between information literacy and critical thinking. Between October 1996 and
May 1997 she conducted four case studies at higher education institutions, and then
analyzed interviews and observation data collected through these case studies. She
interviewed at least one administrator, five professors, and five students at each
institution, for a total of 55 participants. Tsui (2002) found that critical thinking is closely
connected to the process of analytical writing and rewriting, as well as class discussions.
According to Tsui (2002), “by instilling critical thinking in students we groom
individuals to become independent lifelong learners—thus fulfilling one of the long-term
goals of the educational enterprise” (p. 740). Clearly, critical thinking and information
literacy are distinct but connected concepts.

27
Information literacy, as used interchangeably with critical thinking, is commonly
believed to be the foundation of lifelong learning, empowering “people in all walks of
life to seek, evaluate, use and create information effectively to achieve their personal,
social, occupational and educational goals” (International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutions [IFLA], 2006). In her qualitative grounded comparison
study, Kerr (2010) analyzes the relationship between philosophical concepts and
professional practice of information literacy. Kerr (2010) utilizes Argyris and Schön’s
(1974) theoretical framework for theories of action influencing professional practices.
The purposive sample included 11 university libraries. To study espoused theories
(philosophical theories) and theories-in-use (practical theories), and the relationships
between them, Kerr (2010) completed a document analysis of library mission statements,
information literacy goals, and online tutorials at the aforementioned libraries and
conducted in-depth phone interviews with instructional librarians in those institutions.
Kerr (2010) found that libraries differed in their understanding of information
literacy, yet the main theme of their espoused theories centered on information process
and lifelong learning. At the same time, information literacy theories-in-use were less
congruent and often contradicted librarians’ espoused theories, which was demonstrated
by the gaps between mission statements and teaching activities.
Information literacy as a learning outcome. Information literacy is commonly
listed as a learning outcome by academic administrators and accrediting agencies.
Saunders (2010) completed a nationwide four-phase qualitative study on information
literacy as a student learning outcome. First, she analyzed institutional artifacts to find

28
common information literacy definitions, competencies, and learning outcomes. Second,
Saunders (2010) analyzed the content of self-study reports from 264 colleges and
universities accredited by the Middle States Commission in order to determine how many
and to what extent institutions use information literacy as a student learning outcome. In
the third phase she completed a case study of four institutions accredited by the Middle
States Commission. And finally, she studied an additional 229 self-study reports from
colleges and universities nationwide. Her findings were as follows: (1) because
institutions maintain privacy about their student learning outcomes, including information
literacy, greater transparency and accountability are needed for successful outcomes; (2)
institutional leadership and interdisciplinary collaboration are imperative for integration
of information literacy into the curriculum and its assessment as a learning outcome; (3)
in 76.9% of the institutions information literacy is taught by librarians using one-shot
instructional sessions (a behaviorist approach); (4) information literacy teaching should
be integrated into the curricula.
Holliday and Fagerheim (2006) agree with Saunders (2010), advocating for an
inclusive course-integrated information literacy curriculum across all disciplines.
Holliday and Fagerheim (2006) implemented a two-phase mixed-method study
integrating information literacy into the English curriculum at Utah State University. The
participants of the study were students enrolled in the English 1010 (Introduction to
Writing) and the English 2010 (Intermediate Writing) courses at USU, as well as English
instructors and librarians at USU. During the first step, researchers conducted a needs
assessment for instructional goals and needs, performed student behavior analysis basing
it on current scholarship, and administered both librarian and faculty surveys. The

29
surveys were implemented to compare information literacy learning outcomes deemed
valuable by librarians and English instructors. The list of learning outcomes was
borrowed from the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher
Education. The second phase of the study took place after implementing a new
curriculum. It included student self-assessment surveys, a student focus group interview,
and English 1010 and 2010 instructor surveys.
To summarize, information literacy definitions are many, and they differ based on
various theoretical frameworks, professional practice, and values. The most commonly
used definition stems from the behaviorist approach to education. It defines information
literacy as a set of skills that students need to acquire. The constructivist approach to
information literacy critiques this skill-based definition. Instead, constructivists focus on
information literacy as the information seeking and meaning making process. In addition,
information literacy is commonly identified with critical thinking skills, life-long
learning, and student learning outcomes.
Information-seeking models
Over the last several decades, researchers have been trying to understand user
information-seeking behavior not only empirically, but also conceptually. In fact, as of
2005, more than 72 theories and models of information behavior have been developed
(Fisher, Erdelez, & McKechnie, 2005). Wilson (1999) emphasizes the importance of
information behavior models for understanding user behavior and user experiences,
defining an information behavior model as “a framework for thinking about a problem

30
[that] may evolve into a statement of the relationship among theoretical prepositions” (p.
250).
The “information behavior” concept is rooted in the 1960’s research on users and
information use, and dozens of user behavior theories have been developed over the last
two decades across disciplines (Pettigrew & McKechnie, 2001). Some of the commonly
used information seeking models are as follows: Dervin’s (2003) Sense-Making
Approach, Ellis’ (1989) Model of Information Seeking Behavior, Kuhlthau’s (2004)
Information Search Process, Taylor’s (1962) Levels of Need, and Wilson’s (1999) Model
of Information Behavior.
In information use studies, the concept of sense-making has been prominent since
the 1980’s, and is considered one of the major models of information use (Savolainen,
2006). Sense-making puts emphasis on the complexities which surround informationseeking. Dervin (1983) is a key contributor to the sense-making model. According to
Dervin (2003), reducing uncertainty is the main motivator for conducting research. She is
using a constructivist framework for her model. Dervin (2003) describes sense-making as
a set of both internal (cognitive) and external (procedural) forces or energies, which
either enable the individual to move through the gap-bridging research process or hinder
this process. The gap-bridging means the process of moving from the unknown to the
known. The energies involved in gap-bridging might include motivation, help from
others, or barriers to research. Additionally, Dervin (2003) compares sense-making to a
journey where an individual takes a series of repetitive steps to move through the
demands of time and space.

31
Like Dervin (2003), Kuhlthau (2004) uses a constructivist perspective in her
Information Search Process model. She has been developing and modifying this model
through conceptual and empirical research since her dissertation research in 1983.
Kuhlthau (2004) focuses on high school and college students, as well as public library
users. Like Dervin (2003), Kuhlthau (2004) claims that reduction in uncertainty is the
major motivator for research. Kuhlthau (2004) separates the information seeking process
into six distinct stages or tasks. These tasks are as follows: initiation, selection,
exploration, formulation, collection, and presentation. At initiation, an individual
becomes aware of his or her information need. At selection, a person chooses a general
topic to research. During the exploration stage, a user searches for information in order to
focus the study, which is followed by the formulation stage, when an individual uses
received information to focus his or her research. During collection, a user searches for
and collects information, making informed choices about where to look for additional
information. Finally, during presentation, a person summarizes and presents information
(Kuhlthau, 2004).
Additionally, Kuhlthau’s (2004) model describes the actions, feelings, and
thoughts of an individual conducting research associated with each aforementioned task.
According to Kuhlthau (2004), students start with a feeling of uncertainty, followed by
optimism, confusion, then clarity followed by confidence, and finally, relief, satisfaction
or disappointment. Cognitively, students’ thoughts become more focused as they are
moving through the research steps, while physically, students are moving from exploring
their area of interest to documenting their sources.

32
According to Taylor (1962), a user experiences four levels of need when
conducting research, moving from an unconscious to an articulated need for information.
These levels are as follows: 1) Visceral need (actual but unexpressed); 2) Conscious need
(formulated description of need within brain); 3) Formalized need (expressed statement
of need); and 4) Compromised need (question as presented to the information system and
its limitations). Although Taylor’s (1962) model was created before the widespread use
of computer technology, it might still be relevant today as it addresses human-computer
interactions during the information search process. Similar to Kuhlthau (2004), Taylor
(1962) divides the information seeking process into distinct levels, and like Dervin
(2003), Taylor (1962) posits that the search for information begins with a vague need for
information.
Ellis (1989) created a behavioral Model of Information Seeking Behavior to
understand how users searched for information. Ellis (1989) analyzed informationseeking behaviors of 16 social scientists. He tested his model in subsequent years with
additional populations, and identified six stages of the research process: 1) Starting: the
initial search for information; 2) Chaining: following chains of citations or other forms of
referential connection between sources; 3) Browsing: semi-directed searching on the
topic of potential interest; 4) Differentiating: using differences between sources to
examine them; 5) Monitoring: maintaining awareness of new research on the topic
through the monitoring of sources; and 6) Extracting: methodically working through a
specific source to find material of interest (p. 178). The behavioral nature of this
approach indicates that it does not tackle cognitive or emotional sides of information
seeking. However, an advantage of Ellis’s (1989) model is that like Kuhlthau’s (2004)

33
model, it is strengthened by years of empirical research. Ellis (1989) is extensively cited
in the information behavior literature.
Wilson’s (1999) model of information-seeking is related to Ellis’s (1989) model.
Wilson (1999) explains how information needs occur as a result of the user's needs and
his or her environment. Wilson (1999) refers to his model as a macro-level model,
claiming it is more global than Ellis’s (1989) model. Wilson (1999) nests Ellis’s (1989)
model within his model. Like Dervin (2003), Wilson (1999) emphasizes the importance
and intricacies of context for information seeking behaviors.
Godbold (2006) criticizes Wilson’s (1999) and Dervin’s (2003) models asserting
that both authors describe sequences of behavior stages, while the actual user behavior is
typically non-sequential. Contrary to describing information seeking as a need to
overcome barriers to close the information gap as Wilson (1999) and Dervin (2003)
suggest, she offers a multi-directionality model. Godbold (2006) presents an “information
behavior wheel” (p.12), where users choose to exhibit various non-sequential behavior
stages and processes in order to create the desired knowledge state. Like Wilson (1999)
and Dervin (2003), she refers to the user knowledge gap, but states that users base their
information behavior choices on the perceived size of this information gap. According to
Godbold (2006), if a user decides that the information gap is too large, they may choose
not to cross this gap; if the user perceives the gap to be too small, he or she is likely to
ignore it. Only when users perceive the gap to be the right size will they “build the
bridge” to cross their information gap (p. 13). Thus Godbold’s (2006) major contributions
on the subject are the non-sequential user behavior concept and the need to explore users’
perceptions of their information gap.

34
In his qualitative study of seventh grade students’ Internet searching behavior,
Wolcott (1998) incorporated both the Ellis Model and the Kuhlthau Model in his
research. Wolcott (1998) found that students frequently repeated the browsing and
differentiating steps as described by Ellis (1989), yet their processes were cyclical and
non-linear. This finding is similar to Godbold’s (2006) model and confirms Kuhlthau’s
(2004) observations of research as a non-linear process.
Foster (2004) proposed a new interdisciplinary model of user information-seeking
behavior based on his empirical study of 45 academic researchers at the University of
Sheffield, England. Foster (2004) sought to discover what activities, contexts, and
behaviors were used by interdisciplinary users, how information needs vary, and whether
it was appropriate to apply single-disciplinary models to interdisciplinary populations.
Foster (2004) found that series of processes and contextual interactions were taking place
in a nonlinear way, with neither the beginning nor the ending points of the processes
being identifiable. Foster (2004) posits that his new model explains “anomalous patterns
of behavior” (p. 235) often observed in user information seeking behavior. This finding
confirms Godbold’s (2006) and Wolcott’s (1998) research, while contrasting with
previous information-seeking models. Foster’s (2004) model is unique in that it addresses
interdisciplinary research topics, whereas Ellis (1989), Kuhlthau (2004), and Wilson
(1999) all focus on single disciplines.
Despite the abundance of conceptual models in the literature, there is still a gap in
the knowledge regarding the information-seeking behaviors of rural community college
transfer-level composition students. However, understanding existing models may inform

35
practitioners about how these student experiences relate to the processes and models
described in the literature.
Student Use of Online Library Resources
A solid body of literature on student information-seeking behaviors and
preferences emerged over the past two decades. Most research findings demonstrate that
students prefer convenience to quality by choosing to use web sites instead of library
databases (Bell, 2004; Biddix et al., 2011; Fast & Campbell, 2005; Griffith & Brophy,
2005; Judd & Kennedy, 2011; McClure & Clink, 2009; Thompson, 2003; Williams,
2006). For example, in their analysis of student citations, McClure and Clink (2009)
found that only 16% of citations came from article databases. These findings concur with
Marchionini (1992) suggestion that “humans will seek the path of least cognitive
resistance” (p. 156).
Williams (2006) reported that 80% of students started their academic research by
using Google compared to 6% who used the library. Study participants believed that
search engines were as reliable and useful as library databases for conducting academic
research. Judd and Kennedy (2011) and Griffith and Brophy (2005) found that students
preferred speed and convenience over quality when choosing what resources to use.
Griffith and Brophy (2005) found that only 13% of their study participants used library
databases on a regular basis and 55% never used them. Interestingly, students preferred
web search engines and websites, even though they listed accuracy and reliability of
information as the most important selection criteria (Kim & Sin, 2007). Fast and
Campbell (2005) suggested that while students were aware of Google’s limitations, they

36
still preferred the search engine over the library. Schweber, Kelley, and Orr (1998),
however, found that students were often not aware of available library resources.
Some scholars suggested that students did not use online library resources
because they lacked necessary research skills (Judd & Kennedy, 2011; Porter, 2009).
According to Judd and Kennedy (2011), medical students lacked information literacy
skills causing them to use unsophisticated Google and Wikipedia searches resulting in
poor quality sources. However, in her review of existing research, Thompson (2003)
speculated that not enough research had been done to determine whether students lacked
information literacy skills or simply chose the easiest and most familiar path.
Other studies (Biddix et al., 2011; Blackman, 2003; Foster & Gibbons, 2007;
Thompson, 2007) reported that many students use library resources on a regular basis.
Foster and Gibbons’ (2007) study of students at the University at Rochester found that
over half of undergraduate students used library databases on a regular basis. Blackman
(2003) reported that 94.5% of surveyed students used electronic library databases.
Additionally, Biddix et al. (2011) found that although students began the research process
by using search engines and Wikipedia, they turned to academic library resources next.
In Thompson’s study (2007) of distance students at the University of North Carolina,
students ranked library resources as high as they did Google. Eighty two percent of her
study participants stated that they used library databases for research, while 18% stated
that course related research was not required.
Several studies found that students were satisfied with using library databases
(Avdic & Eklund, 2010; Blackman, 2003; Koohang & Ondracek, 2005; McLean & Dew,

37
2004; Oulanov, 2008). Cassidy and Korah (2010) added that satisfaction with using
library databases instead of search engines was correlated with student age: 23-49 year
olds were the most satisfied group using online library databases. McLean and Dew
(2004), on the other hand, found that all age groups found library databases either
“useful” or “very useful.” Oulanov (2008) studied business students’ perceptions on
Business Source Premier, finding high rates of user satisfaction with that database.
Koohang and Ondracek’s (2008) quantitative study of digital library usability
demonstrated that the user experience with digital libraries was adequate.
A noteworthy theme emerged that students saw the benefit of using library
databases expecting that by using library databases, their papers will be of higher quality
(Appleton, 2006; Avdic & Eklund, 2010). Appleton (2006), who conducted a qualitative
study to measure the perceptions about online library resources among vocational further
education (called continuing education in the U.S.) tutors and students in the United
Kingdom, used personal interviews and discussion groups to assess awareness,
perception, and usage by the identified groups, finding that study participants used and
valued e-resources.
McClure and Clink (2009) studied student digital research practices, focusing on
the ways composition students evaluate online resources. The authors found that students
struggled with evaluating sources, particularly identifying authority and bias. Study
participants were aware that they needed to evaluate their website sources, and listed
domain and website names as their most common evaluation technique. At the same
time, students seemed unconcerned with determining source bias. McClure and Clink

38
(2009) suggested that ways in which students seek information and use online resources
seem to determine their online library usage levels.
Silva (2011) measured the effectiveness of teaching support and instructional
materials designed to improve various types of student literacies in a sophomore level
composition course. The researcher used a mixed-method baseline design for three study
participants during an academic quarter. The researcher analyzed student paper drafts to
understand students’ online searching behavior, perceptions, and attitudes towards
research, as well as their source evaluation techniques. She found that teacher
intervention had little impact on student research and writing practices. Additionally, she
established that students tend to reuse existing research and writing techniques, and
evaluate their sources superficially.
Head and Eisenberg (2010) studied college students’ information-seeking
behaviors and college research challenges as part of the Project Information Literacy,
conducted by the School of Information at the University of Washington. After surveying
over eight thousand college students from 25 colleges nation-wide, the researchers found
that students recognized the importance of evaluating their sources, and frequently used
help from friends and family to do so. Head and Eisenberg (2010) also found that
students viewed starting their assignments as the main research challenge.
In a follow-up study, Head (2013) conducted a study of research challenges and
information seeking behaviors of high school and first-year college students as they
became accustomed to college-level research. She interviewed 35 freshmen attending six
colleges and universities, in addition to administering a survey to nearly two thousand

39
high school and college students. She found that the majority of new students (threequarters) experienced difficulties when searching for scholarly sources, evaluating
sources, and integrating them into writing. Students found library databases complex and
challenging. Some limited themselves to searching on Google, because the library
resources were too complicated for them to use. Head (2013) called students’
information-seeking behaviors “Google-centric” (p. 27), arguing that these high-school
acquired skills were insufficient for successful research in college.
Previous research on the student use of online resources may help to inform this
study. While the investigator attempts to bracket her existing knowledge in order to
analyze data more objectively, it may be helpful to compare findings to the existing cases
presented in literature, despite the fact that existing studies investigated other student
populations. Additionally, this research stream supports the research design and research
methods chosen for this study as it may be useful to understand how similar studies have
been conducted.
Summary
The relevant scholarly literature offers many definitions of information literacy,
because scholars and practitioners are trying to define what an information literate
individual is, and how he or she searches for and uses information. Behaviorist and
constructivist approaches to information literacy are two common conceptual
frameworks. Further, scholars are attempting to understand students’ information seeking
behaviors. Some scholars designed conceptual information behavior models, while others
conducted empirical studies to test these models. Yet another body of literature exists on

40
the ways students use online resources. While findings of these empirical student
behavior studies are somewhat contradictory, the majority of them suggest that students
prefer convenience over quality when choosing their sources, and are often struggling
when trying to evaluate their sources. Some but not all students use online library
resources. In short, the two theoretical and one empirical literature streams help to inform
the research design and methods for the present study.

Chapter 3: Research Methodology
Introduction
The primary goal of this study was to capture and understand community college
students’ experiences with conducting research for academic papers in transfer-level
composition courses. Specifically, this study sought to answer the following questions:
1. What are the Yuba College English 1A students’ research experiences

when creating academic research papers?
2. What processes do students follow when conducting academic research?
3. How do students choose and evaluate their sources?
4. What challenges and frustrations might they encounter?

Chapter 3 describes the research methodology employed in this study. It outlines
research design and rationale, the site, population, research methods, methods of data
analysis and ethical considerations.
Research Design and Rationale
This project uses a qualitative research design. Qualitative research enabled the
researcher to capture lived experiences and understand the complexity of processes and
actions that cannot be reduced to numbers. The nature of qualitative research is inductive.
It “seeks to describe the phenomenon in-depth” (Merriam, 2002, p. 8), thus producing
“richly descriptive” results (p. 5). Qualitative researchers focus on the process through
which meaning is socially constructed (Merriam, 2002). Qualitative research design was
a natural choice for this study because the research questions focused on the students’
lived experiences of the research process.

42
This project was conducted in the form of a bounded embedded single case study.
According to Yin (2009), a case study is an intensive empirical study of a current
phenomenon taking place in a real-life situation. The phenomenon being investigated is
the composition student process of conducting research for academic papers. The case
study is an appropriate research method when the following three conditions are present:
1) “How” or “why” questions are addressed, 2) The researcher has limited control over
events, and 3) The study focuses on a current real-life phenomenon (Yin, 2009). All of
these three conditions are present in this study of composition students’ lived experiences
of conducting research for academic papers. Composition students commonly have to
conduct research for their papers. Thus the researcher will be investigating a typical case
of a common occurrence, providing a further rationale for a single case design (Yin,
2009).
The study design is an embedded case study because the researcher investigated
individual English 1A students as subunits of study. Subunits can significantly enhance
an in-depth analysis, providing insights to a single case (Yin, 2009). However, the
researcher brought individual data together for a holistic view of the entire case in order
to avoid a common pitfall of the embedded design, which is treating each subunit as its
own case (Yin, 2009).
In qualitative research the researcher serves as the major data collection and
analysis instrument. The researcher attempts to avoid imposing his or her own worldview
and mental models onto the research. To minimize this potential pitfall, the researcher
engaged in self-reflexivity, a process of critical self-reflection about assumptions and

43
potential biases regarding the research topic (Merriam, 2002). The researcher should be
reflexive throughout the study process, including study design, data collection, and data
analysis. In the present case, as an academic librarian charged with teaching students
information competency skills, the researcher may have research biases that need to be
exposed in order to improve the credibility of this study. As an advanced researcher with
a degree in library sciences, it might have been difficult for the researcher to understand
community college students’ first research experiences. However, the researcher was
aware of the fact that study participants may not share the same knowledge and have
similar skills as the researcher does, and was mindful of this throughout all aspects of this
study.
To establish internal validity of this study and provide for a better understanding
of the problem, the researcher used triangulation of data collection (Rossman & Wilson,
1985). She collected data through reflective essays, individual and focus group
interviews, attempting to include rich, thick description of data collection methods as
well as collected data.
To summarize, the system being investigated is bounded by the process of student
research for academic papers, the site location, which is limited to one rural California
community college campus, and the choice of study participants, which include students
in five sections of transfer-level composition courses. Individual students represent
subunits within this case.

44
Site and Population
Population Description
The population for this study consisted of students enrolled in English 1A College
Composition and Reading courses at Yuba College. English 1A is a transfer level four
unit course with a research component. The course is required for students pursuing an
Associate’s degree or transfer from the College. In Spring 2013, 17 sections of English
1A were taught. The list of all English 1A sections and instructors was obtained through
the YCCD course schedule online. The approximate number of students enrolled in all
English 1A sections was 459 students. English 1A students are required to complete
either one ten-page research paper or a series of shorter research papers on a current issue
requiring the use of multiple sources, including library research.
A purposeful sampling approach was utilized in this study. Creswell (2008)
explains that purposeful qualitative sampling is used to improve the researcher’s
understanding of the phenomenon (p. 214). English 1A students were chosen for this
purposeful sample because the course requires a college-level research paper;
additionally, this course is required for obtaining any Associate’s degree or transfer from
Yuba College. In other words, any student graduating or transferring from Yuba College
must complete an English 1A course. Although many other courses in Language Arts,
Fine Arts, Social Sciences, and Sciences require students conduct research, English 1A is
the most frequently offered course at the College exemplifying college-level coursework.
The total sample for the study was 44 English 1A students from five sections
taught by the same instructor. Thirty three English 1A students from three sections taught

45
in Spring 2013 submitted a reflective essay at the end of their research projects. Three
students were interviewed and eight students participated in two separate focus-group
interviews during Fall 2013 semester.
Site Description
The YCCD district covers eight counties and about 4200 square miles of territory
in rural, north-central California. Yuba College is a small rural community college
located in Marysville, CA. It was founded in 1927. Yuba College is one of the two
colleges of the Yuba Community College District. In addition to the main campus in
Marysville, CA, Yuba College has educational centers in Clearlake and Yuba City, and
an outreach facility on Beale Air Force Base. Yuba College primarily serves three
counties: Yuba, Sutter, and Clear Lake; all are predominately rural and agricultural
communities. Yuba College offers transfer courses, vocational and technical degrees, and
certificates, as well as self-enrichment and continuing education courses. Yuba College
full-time student equivalent for 2011-2012 was 9986 (California Community Colleges
Chancellor’s Office, 2013).
Several demographic characteristics in the district are noteworthy for this study
sample. The student body is 12% Asian, 5% Black, 24% Hispanic, 49% White, 2%
Native American, 1% Filipino, and 7% Other race. Gender diversity is 62% female and
38% male. The average student age is 27.3, with the youngest student being 13 and the
oldest 85. Students enrolled through the Marysville campus tend to be younger and fulltime compared to other sites in the District (Yuba College Planning, Research and
Student Success, 2010).

46
The focus of this research is on academic research papers and information
literacy. Yuba College identifies critical thinking and information competency as two of
its Institutional Student Learning Outcomes (Yuba College, n.d.). These outcomes are
accomplished through a variety of courses, one of which is the English 1A course. At
Yuba College, all transfer and Associates degree programs require students to complete
the English 1A course, which is a transfer level four unit course with a research
component. This course promotes “the development of analytical reading and the writing
of college-level essays, including critical analysis, rhetorical forms, and collegiate
research” (Yuba College Catalog, 2011-2012). The course objectives are as follows:
1. Write 7,000 to 9,000 words over the course of the semester.
2. Write a college-level essay, using the techniques of writing as a

process.
3. Write an organized essay controlled by a thesis, incorporating various

rhetorical modes and using principles of unity and coherence.
4. Write grammatically correct, stylistically sophisticated sentences.
5. Cite and document sources correctly.
6. Pass the holistically scored departmental final with a score of "3" or

higher.
7. Evaluate sources while conducting research for academic essays.
8. Read, comprehend, and analyze college-level essays, recognizing

authors' tone and inferences (English 1A Course Outline, 2012).
The Yuba College Library also has objectives regarding skills needed for
academic research papers and information literacy. Of the stated course objectives,
academic librarians believe that teaching students how to conduct academic research,
evaluate sources, and cite sources properly are among their primary professional
responsibilities. Information competency is also chosen as the program-level Student

47
Learning Outcome for the college library, which offers an instructional program based on
customized instruction appropriate for community college level students. The library
assesses this Student Learning Outcome by administering instructor surveys at the end of
each semester.
The majority of English 1A students at Yuba College complete their research
papers. In 2011-12 school year, 63.9% of students who were enrolled at census passed
English 1A with a grade of C or better, and of the students who were enrolled at census,
85.1% of students were retained until the end of class, according to Yuba College Office
of Institutional Effectiveness (2012). However, these students’ academic research
experiences remain largely hidden from educators.
Site access
The researcher obtained permission to conduct research through both the Yuba
College approval process and the Drexel Institutional Review Board. First, the researcher
obtained preliminary site permission from Yuba College. Second, the researcher
completed an IRB application including interview protocols and informed consent form.
Next, the researcher had it reviewed for approval by the Drexel Institutional Review
Board. Finally, the researcher obtained the final permission to conduct research from the
research site following IRB approval.
The researcher is currently employed at Yuba College as the full-time librarian.
The researcher was able to reach the English 1A students through direct contact with
instructors, in the library, and via College email. The researcher selected course sections
based on instructor availability and their specific research assignments.

48
The researcher collected data at the end of academic semesters while school was
still in session. During that time, students have already completed their research
assignments, but the experiences were still fresh in their memory; additionally, students
were still easy to reach because classes were still taking place on campus.
Research Methods
This study utilized the following three qualitative data collection instruments:
reflective essays, individual and focus group interviews. Yin (2009) posits that a major
strength of case study data collection is the ability to combine multiple sources of
evidence. Yin (2009) further explains that the main advantage of multiple data collection
instruments is triangulation, or “the development of converging lines of inquiry” (p. 115).
According to Yin (2009), data triangulation offers multiple measures for the same
phenomenon thus increasing the validity of the study.
Reflective Essays
Reflective essays enable an individual to discuss and reflect upon their
experiences after completing a project. Essays give students an opportunity to describe
their experiences in their own voice. Students responded by writing down their
experiences in a semi-structured format answering probing questions on the handout (see
Appendix A). This prompt was modified from an earlier prompt developed by the
University of Redlands Library (University of Redlands, 2013).
Instrument description. Study participants composed reflective essays about
their research experiences when preparing an academic paper. They reflected on their

49
research processes, and described steps taken, expressed their thoughts on academic
research, and shared their source evaluation strategies and research challenges.
Participant selection, identification, and invitation. Three English 1A sections
participated in this activity based on the instructors’ availability. The researcher made
prior arrangements with the English instructor and scheduled a computer lab for this
exercise. To facilitate student participation, reflective essays were typed in a computer
lab during a regularly assigned class time. The instructor invited students to participate,
explaining to them that participation in this activity was voluntary (see Appendix B). The
instructor offered an alternative assignment for those students who did not wish to
participate in this research or who were under 18 years old. Prior to participating in the
reflective essay assignment, each participant read and signed a consent form, passing it to
the researcher. Those students who chose not to participate in research returned their
consent form blank.
Data collection. Students wrote down their experiences in a semi-structured
format following writing prompts given by the researcher (see Appendix A). Participants
had about 50 minutes to write their essays. The researcher collected the essays, and the
course instructor neither had access to the essays nor knew which students completed an
alternative assignment.
Individual Interviews
According to Yin (2009), the interview is an essential data collection method in a
case study. Merriam (1998) posits that this format enables the researcher to respond “to
the situation at hand, to the emerging worldview of the respondent, and to new ideas on

50
the topic” (p. 74). The purpose of the interviews was to engage in dialogue with study
participants to gain insight into their research experiences when preparing academic
papers. Compared to reflective essays, interviews offer an opportunity for more in-depth
reflection and a longitudinal point of reference to include previous experiences and
additional relevant details.
Instrument description. In-depth one-on-one semi-structured interviews were
conducted with three study participants. The interviews occurred shortly after student
research essays were completed in order to capture student memories while these
memories were still fresh. The researcher was looking for deep subjective accounts of
what students thought about their experiences conducting research for academic papers.
The nature of the questions was exploratory, designed to learn more about the Yuba
College English 1A students’ experiences.
The central research question was “What are the Yuba College English 1A
students’ experiences with conducting research for academic papers?” The researcher
probed to find out what processes students followed when conducting academic research,
how students chose and evaluated their sources, and what challenges and frustrations they
encountered. The main advantage of interviewing participants is to gather insights that
would not be possible to obtain through observations given the fact that student research
process takes place over a period of several weeks.
Participant selection, identification, and invitation. Interviewees were chosen
based on their availability and eligibility. Only students 18 or over were selected to
participate in the study. The researcher invited students to participate in the study via

51
instructors’ announcements in class (see Appendix C). Three volunteers were
interviewed.
Data collection. The interviews followed a semi-structured interview protocol
(see Appendix D). This protocol was modified from an earlier prompt developed by Duke
and Asher (2012). The interviews lasted approximately 45 minutes each and were
recorded and transcribed. The probing questions included research obstacles experienced,
research steps followed, sources of information consulted, and help sought, among
others. Prior to participating in an interview, each participant read and signed a consent
form. Students were notified that participation in the study was voluntary. The interviews
took place at an empty classroom, a neutral location on campus. The researcher took field
notes after each interview to gather fresh reflections and thoughts about the interviews.
The researcher kept field notes and transcripts in a locked cabinet for future research.
Focus Group Interviews
Focus group interviews enable group dynamics, uncovering data that may have
remained hidden if only using individual interviews. It gives a “voice” to participants and
allows the researcher to see “the way people see their own reality” (Liamputtong, 2011,
p. 4). Focus group interviews can be effective in capturing shared lived experiences,
thoughts and feelings of study participants (Liamputtong, 2011). Indeed, research is in
part a group process because students are together when they receive research
assignments, they may talk to each other about research either in class or outside the
class. A focus group interview is appropriate for topics which are not culturally
inappropriate, deeply personal, or excessively sensitive (Merriam, 2009), making it a

52
suitable choice for this study. Focus group interviews are advantageous because sharing
an experience by one member often encourages further sharing by other group members.
The researcher may then be able to gain insight into collective aspects of research, thus
enriching collected data.
Instrument description. Two focus group interviews with four students each
were led and facilitated by the researcher. The researcher asked questions, encouraging
answers from each member of the focus group. She attempted to create a “comfortable,
permissive environment” during the focus group interview to encourage open sharing
(Krueger & Casey, 2009, p. 6).
Participant selection, identification, and invitation. Students were invited to
participate in focus group interviews verbally by their English 1A instructor (see
Appendix C). Eight volunteers were chosen to participate in the focus group interviews
based on their availability and eligibility. Only students 18 years or older were selected to
participate. Students were notified that participation in the study is voluntary. Prior to
participating in a focus group interview, each participant read and signed a consent form.
Data collection. The focus group interviews followed a semi-structured interview
protocol using open-ended questions (see Appendix E). This protocol was adapted from
an earlier prompt developed by Dubicki (2010). The interviews took place in an empty
classroom at a neutral location on campus, and lasted approximately one hour. The
interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. To minimize the potential difficulty of
recognizing participants’ voices on the audio recording, each participant was asked to
state their name prior to responding to a question. The researcher took notes after the

53
interview to gather fresh reflections and thoughts. The researcher kept notes and
transcripts in a locked cabinet for future research.
Data Analysis Procedures
Yin (2009) posits that case study research data analysis can be perplexing as it
does not prescribe fixed formulas or recipes for researchers. The researcher utilized a
qualitative approach to data analysis. In qualitative studies, the researcher first gathers
data then organizes it for analysis (Creswell, 2008). Data analysis and data collection
phases are iterative, as the researcher moves back and forth between data collection and
data analysis phases of research (Creswell, 2008). The researcher followed a cyclical,
repetitive process for data analysis.
Yin (2009) suggests that “playing” with one’s data is an important initial step in
data analysis (p. 129). First, the researcher read reflective essays for emerging themes and
repeating ideas. Then she listened to recordings of the interviews. Next, the researcher
read all the interview transcripts and reflective essays for an overview of the phenomenon
as a whole. In qualitative research, the investigator reads data multiple times, to obtain “a
general sense of the data,” while analyzing it each time (Creswell, 2008, p. 250).
At the next stage, Dedoose (2013) computer-assisted qualitative data analysis
software was used to code and categorize textual data from the interviews and reflective
essays. Each identified code was supported with excerpts of relevant quotes. Yin (2009)
states that qualitative data analysis software can be a helpful assistive tool for coding
large amounts of textual data. However, Yin (2009) also warns that researchers should
not solely rely on computerized software for data analysis as it is merely a tool for coding

54
and organizing data. Codes that emerge with the use of computerized software do not
specifically answer more general “how” or “why” research questions, requiring a higher
level of thinking from the investigator (Yin, 2009).
Once all the data was collected and coded, the researcher created a descriptive
framework for organizing this study, which is one of the general data analysis strategies
promoted by Yin (2009). Because the purpose of this case study was descriptive, the
researcher organized coded data by general topics.
Yin (2009) cautions that the most important principle of data analysis in case
study research is “to address the most significant aspect of the case study” (p. 161).
Adhering to this principle ensures that the main issue was not avoided out of fear of
negative findings (Yin, 2009). Thus the researcher was mindful of addressing the stated
goals of this study within defined case boundaries. The researcher analyzed coded data
independently by rereading all textual data, comparing and contrasting themes and
concepts from reflective essays and interviews to each other and to the whole
phenomenon.
Throughout the data analysis process, the researcher was also careful to set aside
her own personal experiences. Giorgi (2009) and Moustakas (1994) refer to this exercise
as bracketing, describing it as essential in qualitative data analysis. Bracketing enables
the researcher to acknowledge her own experiences and not allow them to be engaged
while analyzing data. Instead, the researcher is more likely to be able to focus on the
experiences of study participants.

55
Stages of Data Collection
Upon obtaining IRB certification from Drexel University in March 2013, the
researcher recruited participants and collected reflective essays in April 2013. The
researcher read and coded reflective essays in August 2013 prior to conducting individual
and focus group interviews in October 2013. Once interview transcripts were transcribed,
the researcher continued data analysis in December 2013 through February 2014 as
discussed in the data analysis procedures section of this chapter. The process of data
collection and analysis was iterative, in which earlier data collection and analysis
informed later data collection and analysis.
Ethical Considerations
The researcher sought Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from Drexel
University and Yuba College. The participants’ confidentiality has been protected by
using participant numbers instead of their names. Study subjects joined or chose to
withdraw from the research voluntarily having received adequate information about it.
All study participants reviewed and signed an informed consent form, informing them of
the purpose of the study, potential benefits and potential risks of participating.
Additionally, to protect study subjects, all video and audio recordings and artifacts will
be securely stored and then destroyed based on the process and timeline established by
Drexel University policies.

56
Chapter 4: Findings, Results, and Interpretations
This chapter describes the findings of the study. Additionally, it synthesizes the
study results of the researcher’s analysis through the lenses of the three research streams
from the Literature Review in Chapter 2. Participants’ comments, taken from reflective
essays and interview transcripts, are used to the extent possible to substantiate the
findings. As explained in the methodology section, the participants’ identities were kept
confidential through the use of participant numbers instead of names. The chapter
concludes with a summary of the findings, results, and interpretations.
Participant Demographics
The researcher collected 33 reflective essays from three sections of the English
1A class, conducted two focus group interviews with four participants each, and three
individual interviews. All participants were ages 18 and over. No further demographic
data were collected.
Case Description
The case boundary encompasses the academic research paper process by students
in five English 1A sections at a single rural community college taught by the same
instructor during two consecutive semesters (Spring 2013 and Fall 2013). Individual
students represent subunits within this case.
Findings
The purpose of this section is to provide an understanding of the participants’
experiences as described in their own words (Auerbach& Silverstein, 2003). The quotes

57
presented in this chapter reflect students’ natural voices as they wrote or spoke them.
Coding and analysis of data revealed the three major themes: 1) Research Process, 2)
Library and Help, and 3) Mental Process. The Research Process theme focuses on study
participants’ research activities, including their detailed research steps and some of the
issues and challenges they faced. The Library and Help theme focuses on whether
respondents used the library or any other resources, or sought help to complete their
research assignments. The Mental Process theme provides an overview of what students
thought about their research experiences, how they felt about conducting research, and
what they learned through this process.
Further, themes were broken down into several sub-themes, for a total of five
sub-themes. Subthemes are divided further into several elements. Figure 2 illustrates
three major themes, five supporting subthemes, and 15 elements.

Research Process
The Research Process theme provides an overview of the study participants’
research activities. This theme contains only one sub-theme, Research Steps.
Research steps. Study participants described their research process in detail,
identifying the steps they took when conducting academic search. These research steps
varied, but included seeking information, evaluating information, weeding out
information, incorporating sources into writing, and citing information. Students
generally placed large emphasis on source selection and source evaluation.
Seeking Information. At the Seeking Information step, students discussed types
of resources they searched, technologies they used to access sources, and the rationales
for their choices. Study participants described their information seeking process in much
more detail than other steps.
Among the types of resources searched, Google was mentioned most frequently.
Virtually all study participants stated that they used Google during their research process.
When conducting research online, I usually Google my topic and search for
reliable sources such as articles from the news, journals, or specific websites
pertaining my topic. (P32)
I usually take the same steps every time when writing up a research paper. I first
look up multiple credible sources and gather all my information… There is no
specific website or source that I return to every time, although I do find that
Google.com is a very good starting point for all my research. (P1)
Usually I started on Google and I tried to stay with the legit [sources], the
interviews and stuff. I tried to watch those and I tried to stay away from
Wikipedia and the encyclopedias and all that because they write what you want.
(P35)
My main tool for research has been the Internet. I would just Google whatever it
is that I was researching to find information that I needed. Googling a specific

60
subject, I found it not to be very effective for me, because when you Google
something so much information is given to you and I found myself going through
all the information to weed out all the irrelevant information, this took a lot of
time. Once I found information I needed or wanted to use, I would set it as a
favorite so that I could go back and reevaluate it. (P22)
A third of the participants mentioned using Wikipedia for research. However, students
differed in ways they used Wikipedia for course assignments. Some students used it as a
point of access to other sources, such as articles or web pages, while others incorporated
Wikipedia entries directly as a source of information. In other words, while some
participants used Wikipedia as a resource, others selected it as one of their cited sources.
I didn't know if it was an appropriate source or if it was just ... something from
way out there. Somebody said you can't use Wikipedia because people can go in
and change it… I never knew that … I think that's half where I got most of my
stuff... (P33)
I eventually stopped using ProQuest and stuck with the website Wikipedia
because I could easily look up anything I wanted to and find all the information
that I needed. (P15)
I really liked the online Wikipedia as it had all the important facts I was looking
for to continue my research, such as the name of, Saint Athanasius, who was
credited with accumulating the books of the Bible. (P9)
Others, however, realized that it was not a scholarly resource and used it primarily for
background information and to locate references.
I look at Wikipedia just for the sake of, "I can't find anything else, really" or
there's just a whole novel on the subject rather than just a little page review or
something. I'll just start clicking through the references on Wikipedia. Like there
was one we did that was referenced to [inaudible 00:14:07] home, so I went to
that and I got a bunch of information off that. I was like, "Wow, this is pretty
cool, actually. (P37)
Yeah. That's what I do and then sometimes, if you find something you really like,
you can just go to the website and site it from the website instead of Wikipedia.
(P38)

61
Another student seconded this statement. He specified that he used Wikipedia “to quickly
get an idea of a research topic even if it may not always be accurate” (P18). Then he
explained further,
An example was when I was doing research on Cesar Chavez, and I used
Wikipedia to get a general idea about his life and the major cornerstones in his
life so I could focus on his achievements as an activist for farmworker rights.
Then instead of directly citing from Wikipedia I scrolled down to the references
section at the bottom and cited from the source Wikipedia used after I had clicked
on the hyperlink and reviewed the information. (P18)
On the other hand, a quarter of the study participants indicated that they chose not to use
Wikipedia at all because of its lack of authority and credibility.
Wikipedia, for example, is a website that I feel has zero credibility seeing as how
anyone can write what they want. (P10)
I look for either the .org, .gov, .edu, something that you know is going to be,
hopefully, accurate. It's not just some .com website or from Wikipedia or
something, and then they don't have any references of who wrote the article. (P37)
Making sure it's legit, that's a really, really hard part, especially when Wikipedia
is the one [site] where most people get their information from and anybody can
put whatever they want in there and sometimes it'll have the right information, but
it doesn't matter because anybody can put whatever they want in it. (P40)
Either after searching Google, or in addition to it, about a quarter of the students
attempted to use library databases at least once. Students’ experiences with library
research varied, and are discussed in detail in the Library and Help theme.
The large amount of information available over the Internet caused some students
to feel frustrated when finding and choosing sources.
I enjoy looking subjects up on the Internet, however, there is so much information
on the Internet it is hard to choose which information to use. (P20)
Sometimes I get stuck and don’t know where to find more reliable information.
This happens when I go to multiple sites and the information contradicts each
other and I don’t know which is fact or opinion. (P13)

62
Just finding a good source that has real information. That's just the main thing
because you can put false information on your paper and get a bad grade. (P39)
The second section of the Seeking Information element focused on technologies
students used to seek information. These technologies varied among students and
included personal computers at home, library computes, and smart phones.
I don’t even use the library because I have a laptop and a computer at home along
with a printer. (P13)
Mainly, my research I just do at home because my computer is at home. (P42)
Most of the research that I have done this semester, I have done on my smart
phone. (P7)
At home I barely have an Internet signal… I just go to the library … I sit in there
from 11:30 to maybe 6:00, depending on how long the research assignment is and
I'll get it done because class doesn't start until about 6:00 and my class before that
ends at about 11:30. (P40)
Technological limitations seemed to determine what resources students ended up
using for their research projects.
Until 3 weeks ago I did not own a computer, so doing research was not a simple
thing to do. Most of the research that I have done this semester, I have done on
my smart phone, which honestly is not that smart at all since it is extremely
outdated, so the number of research engines I can use is very limited… When my
only Internet access at home was on my phone, I could not sign into the campus
portal, and thus did not have access to these wonderful websites. (P7)
Most of my studies outside of school have been done independently in the
comfort of my room on my laptop. (P11)
Regardless of the type of computer students used to access the Internet, they all
needed to log in to MyCampus Portal in order to use the library databases off-campus or
through a wireless Internet connection on campus. The library databases could only be
accessed directly through the library website when using computer terminals in the
computer labs on campus. Some study participants reported experiencing various
technical difficulties which prevented them from using the online library.

63
Finding creditable sources for me was so miserable because the online library the
school has to offer seems to only work on the school’s server. My Internet at
home can’t process the online library quickly, efficiently and without errors which
force me to have to stay or come on campus just to do homework. Having a full
time job makes that nearly impossible, if I could do research at home it would be
much simpler and less of a fuss to do a paper. (P24)
When study participants explained the rationales behind their information seeking
choices, convenience seemed to be a main consideration. It also appeared that students
looked for flexibility when considering what resources to use.
I have gone to the Marysville library and found books to do research; however,
mostly I use the Internet because it is more convenient for my schedule. (P8)
The Internet was the only resource that I used in my researches, and it was
convenient for me to use. (P5)
Most of my studies outside of school have been done independently in the
comfort of my room on my laptop. (P11)
Another study participant wrote, “Because of the ease of access to information via
the Internet and because I am sometimes very lazy it is typically easiest to use the
Internet for my information” (P19). Someone else agreed,
I never do a research project or paper without my computer or really, the Internet.
It’s my lifeline for everything these days. To be asked to do a research paper
without the use of the Internet and my bestest research friend: Google would be
absolute torture. (P24)
I limit myself to only using what I find on Google. (P10)
Yet another consideration when determining the convenience of resources was their
portability. In this example, database applications were considered advantageous because
of the ability to bring research along.
Even though the school’s online library could be very inconvenient it’s very
convenient as well. It quickly narrows down my first search to find the best
source, The best thing about it is that I don’t usually need to buy reading material;
it conveniently can be seen on the computer screen as a PDF file. This online
database makes my research experience a manageable one at times. Once I could

64
get an app on my phone for it, then all my needs for research will have truly been
met because I could take my research everywhere I do. (P26)
Because students were used to searching for information on Google in their daily
lives, turning to Google for research assignments seemed like a natural habit for them.
My search engine of choice is usually Google. This is due to the fact that because
of how long I have been using Google I have learned to navigate it fairly quickly,
efficiently and the most important reason of all is because it has become a habit
that after turning on the Internet I immediately go to Google in order to search for
something. (P19)
Evaluating Information. Students made judgments about their located sources
using criteria they themselves established through prior experience in order to decide if a
source is credible. Determining credibility was an essential evaluation step in the research
process, with perceived credibility being a relevant consideration for students. A student
wrote, “Before selecting my tools and deciding which resources where valuable and
efficient for me to explore, I’d verify the credibility of the source” (P6).
Nearly half of the study participants discussed the importance of credible sources
to their successful research. Study participants tried to establish credibility, reliability,
and trustworthiness of their sources by using self-styled research evaluation techniques
they were familiar with. Many students brought up the importance of identifying biases,
but at least half identified it as a significant research challenge.
Sometimes it seems we face a research assignment and just have no clue where to
start or what you can use as a credible source that you end up just not doing it.
(P8)
I usually take the same steps every time when writing up a research paper. I first
look up multiple credible sources and gather all my information. (P1)
Students mentioned encountering a variety of the Internet sources and websites.
They realized that not everything they found online was appropriate for use as academic

65
sources and incorporated their self-styled evaluation techniques. Some looked for
domains as criteria, “The domain, yeah, like .edu, .gov, .org, because those are more than
likely credible references rather than letsparty.com or whatever” (P37).
I have found that .com websites and news stations have too much false
information. I try and stay away from the news depending on what station you are
listening to they all pretty much bias. I find .org websites to be very helpful, it
seems to me a lot of their websites are based on facts. (P2)
I look for either the .org, .gov, .edu, something that you know is going to be,
hopefully, accurate. It's not just some .com website or from Wikipedia or
something, and then they don't have any references of who wrote the article. (P37)
The site. If it's from a school or a newspaper, I usually trust it. (P40)
Sites need to be verified to know what they were… like .org was for government
and that .com was for commerce or commercials or stuff like that. (P33)
Others used different measures, such as “it looks legit.” (P40)
If the author makes basic grammar mistakes or rants and raves, I won’t waste my
time with it and I’ll move on. There’s a certain professionalism that I’m always
looking for when I search through the Internet. (P24)
Still others tried to verify facts and address contradictions by comparing what various
sources claimed. One student lamented, “I have to spend countless hours opening four to
seven tabs on my computer to see if all the information on my topic is somewhat similar”
(P23). Others agreed,
I try to make sure that any information that I use in an essay or whatever, I try and
make sure that it's something that I've seen, not once or twice, but throughout
several different things that I read just to make sure that if ten people say they saw
a flying bat, they saw a flying bat. You get one person you might be a little out
there. (P35)
I'll research something and if I see that one is distinct, has it's own way and then
four others are saying the same thing, I'm going to go with the four other sites.
(P39)

66
I would see if it's on multiple ... the way I judge it, if it's on multiple sites or not
Wikipedia, really. (P39)
I’d have to find at least 2 different sources on the same subject before I could
effectively form a considered opinion about the subject. (P18)
I would research a topic, bring up three or more pages and read what was written
on the topics, if they all read a similar story then I would continue to research
until I felt I had the basic facts of a certain subject down. (P30)
About half of the students acknowledged struggling with evaluating their sources.
In fact, a key reason research was challenging to them was due to the need to evaluate
sources critically.
The con from only using the Internet for your research was that I had to decide if
the articles were legitimately telling me the truth on the information that it was
giving me. Authors seem to tell only one side of the story, and they seemed as if
they did not have enough proof to back up their own storyline. Some authors
seemed to not have enough of their own resources on the topic they were trying to
write about. They would not make clear statements about the subjects, and it
seemed to me as if they were just stating opinions and not actual facts. It was
difficult because they would make their topics or subjects very interesting and
almost believable, but at the same time you had to analysis and breakdown on
what they were writing about. (P5)
I have encountered many obstacles during my research projects, the most
common of which was finding extremely biased information, which makes it very
difficult to find the truth of the event. (P25)
Was I able to recognize bias or contradictions in information sources? It was hard
to recognize bias and contradictions in informational sources. I needed to read
and re-read in order to find out what they were saying. (P3)
Some students stated that they did not understand how to evaluate their sources.
I didn't know if it was an appropriate source or if it was just something from way
out there. Somebody said you can't use Wikipedia because people can go in and
change it… I never knew that… I think that's half where I got most of my stuff.
(P33)
I evaluate the selected material by first drawing out my outline. Making sure that
the material selected was the pertinent one for the essay. (P3)
Weeding out information. Based on their evaluation, students discarded the
sources that they decided were not credible. While individuals identified a variety of web

67
pages in their initial searches, as they were drilling down into research topics students
seemed intentional in weeding out not credible sources based on relevancy. In contrast to
the previous two steps, though, study participants did not say as much about weeding out
information or using sources in writing.
When picking out the information that I want, depending on how I’m trying to
present my paper I will pick out information that I find credible, and at also
exempt any un-credible information. (P1)
To separate the crap from the truth is a bit of a process. (P24)
In order to evaluate the sources, I take a look at similar ones on different sites in
order to see their credibility. This determines whether or not the sources with the
material I need will be used in the final draft of my paper. (P4)
Incorporating sources into writing. Having evaluated and weeded out their
sources, study participants worked on integrating selected sources into their writing. This
step was also listed as the most time-consuming or difficult task for about 10% of the
respondents.
Sometimes you are given a subject that has limited information and you can’t help
but write an essay that has already been written. This is my biggest problem
because I just feel like the material I’m presenting isn’t sufficient for the
assignment. (P28)
Some of the biggest problems I had while researching my papers were reading
and writing papers. (P2)
I have a really bad time writing the paper. I can search information for like a week
and a half before it's due, and then I still just don't write the paper. (P38)
Definitely the thing that takes the longest for me is writing the body of the paper.
(P36)
Citing sources. Citing sources using MLA format is a course requirement. The
ability to cite sources accurately was another difficulty sometimes identified by students,
although not as frequently as other issues. About 10% of the respondents mentioned that
source citation was challenging to them.

68
I just started learning how to cite my work last semester when I took my English 50
class so I’m still trying to understand the process of how that works. Not completely
knowing how to do that in the top of my head also makes it a little harder for me to
complete my research papers. (P15)
It was always too difficult to cite any sources I would find. (P17)
Library and Help
The Library and Help theme describes whether the students used the library or
any other assistance to complete their research.
Library Use. This subtheme describes library attitudes, library non-users and
library users.
Library attitudes. The Library Attitudes element describes the extent to which
students used the library and its resources, or reasons why they chose not to use the
library. The majority of study participants never used library resources. Only a quarter of
the students at least tried using library databases. “I have occasionally used library
electronic resources like JSTOR to find academic journals” (P18) wrote one student.
The library resources were regarded as more credible and authoritative, “library
electronic resources come in handy when I have to cite a more reliable source” (P18).
However, students preferred using Google as they perceived it to be faster and easier to
use.
I have gone to the Marysville library and found books to do research; however,
mostly I use the Internet because it is more convenient for my schedule. (P8)
My search engine of choice is usually Google this is due to the fact that because
of how long I have been using Google I have learned to navigate it fairly quickly,
efficiently and the most important reason of all is because it has become a habit
that after turning on the Internet I immediately go to Google in order to search for
something. (P19)

69
Library non-users. The reasons cited for not using the library ranged from not
knowing about library resources, to being in a hurry or too busy with work commitments
to try them, to experiencing technological difficulties. When compared to the Google
interface, library databases appeared clumsy and challenging to learn, requiring students
to learn the interface and to figure out which of the databases to use. A student wrote,
“Sometimes when searching for an unspecified topic the sources that came up were a bit
cluttered and disorganized” (P30). Students generally preferred the familiarity of the
Google navigation to the perceived complexity of the library databases.
Issues with technology and not understanding how to use databases are commonly
cited as reasons for not using databases.
“P33: “Half the time I can't get on My Portal anyway, because ... something's
been wrong with it.
Researcher: Is it still not fixed?
P33: I tried last week and it still like ... what the heck? … I tried three different
times or four different times ... I still haven't been able to get on there.
Researcher: Oh. So you couldn't use the library databases even if you tried to?
P33: Not from home.” (P33)
Finding creditable sources for me was so miserable because the online library the
school has to offer seems to only work on the school’s server. My Internet at
home can’t process the online library quickly, efficiently and without errors which
force me to have to stay or come on campus just to do homework. Having a full
time job makes that nearly impossible, it I could do research at home it would be
much simpler and less of a fuss to do a paper. (P26)
I've wanted to try that [the online library] but I haven't because [the College] has
their own portal right? I've tried to go on portal and it won't let me on. (P34)
Until 3 weeks ago I did not own a computer, so doing research was not a simple
thing to do. Most of the research that I have done this semester, I have done on
my smart phone, which honestly is not that smart at all since it is extremely
outdated, so the number of research engines I can use is very limited… a librarian
[came] to our class to talk to us about doing research, and he gave us a lot of good
tips, like telling us about the links on the campus portal to websites like JSTOR
and Proquest. When my only Internet access at home was on my phone, I could

70
not sign into the campus portal, and thus did not have access to these wonderful
websites. (P7)
I got onto the portal once because I followed all those steps ... and I went, "oh
okay!" Then I couldn't get back on there again after that. (P33)
Library users. On the other hand, a quarter of students used college library
databases. The most commonly used database, by far, was ProQuest (11), followed by
ebrary (4), JSTOR (4), and Credo Reference (1). ProQuest is a multidisciplinary online
collection of scholarly journals, ebrary is a collection of ebooks, JSTOR is a scholarly
journal archive in humanities and social sciences, and Credo Reference is an online
reference database.
I find myself more using the school library, the Proquest, EBSCOhost, Google
Reference, that kind of stuff, just because it's hard facts rather than beating around
the bush … I have a question to answer, ProQuest or whatever, you can type it in
with the tools for a search engine, what issues or whatever, it gives you the
answer right there in your face rather than really having to beat your face against
the keyboard and try to find factual information through .coms or what not. (P37)
Another participant agreed,
Once my opinion is formed it is time to go to my favorite place; ProQuest.
ProQuest is like a bartender. You walk in order a drink, like a “articles on
immigration reform” and ProQuest serves it up straight away. No hassle, or “did
you mean…”, or “including results from”, and ProQuest is not self-edited like
other websites such as Wikipedia. I like a bartender who gives me what I order
and nothing else. ProQuest allows me to get right to the sources I need without
all the hassle of dealing with other things like “Billy’s Blog on Immigration” or
“Phil’s against foreigners”, basically it cuts out all the waste on the Internet that
maybe helpful when I am looking to form an opinion, but not actually when I sit
down to write the essay. (P27)
Help sought. This subtheme describes whether study participants sought
assistance throughout their research process, and the reasons they did or did not obtain
help. Consistently, students stated that they preferred to work on their research
independently without any help.

71
Reasons for not seeking help. The most common stated reason for not getting
help was self-reliance followed by being too busy with outside work.
Another student wrote,
In college, I never felt the need to ask for guidance on how to discover research
on projects. (P31)
I could have asked for help a lot of times when I was stuck on figuring out how to
do my research papers but I decided to do them on my own. I am self-taught in
many things and are also very stubborn, so, when it comes to the subject of
getting help I don’t. I like to try and figure things out on my own. (P34)
I do almost all my research assignments independently and without any help. If
anything, I probably just ask a friend on what they wrote about if I am completely
stuck and need an idea on how to start. I don’t even ask the instructor for help or a
librarian. I do not use the writing center. It’s hard to find time to visit all these
places when I am a full time student and work. (P13)
No, I research independently. The English subject is easier for me. It's math that I
need help with. (P34)
It’s hard to find time to visit all these places [the library and the writing center]
when I am a full time student and work. (P13)
Even the student who expressed the most uncertainty and insecurity about being
able to conduct research stated, “I was just embarrassed to go in there and ask for help
like that” (P33).
Only two students referred to asking the instructor for help, but even then just for
the assignment details.
When the research topics are not too difficult, most of the time my work will be
done independently, unless I have difficulties understanding the prompts given to
me, then I refer to my instructor for help. (P4)
The only times I do ask for assistance, it may be from the instructor, to further
clarify the instructions. (P1)

72
Students seemed to remember having a library research presentation at the beginning of
the semester. One student wrote,
We were lucky to have the librarian come into one of our class sections and
explain how to use all the different resources and databases. I’ve quickly realized
that if it wasn’t for the librarian coming into one of my classes and explaining
how to use the online library I would have no idea how to find a creditable source.
(P26)
Others seconded this sentiment,
My whole class received guidance at the very beginning of the class on how to
locate or best utilize resources available to us, which was really helpful and
provided us with rich information on how to carry on an accurate research. (P6)
My college Professor first invited a man that works in the Yuba Community
College library, into the classroom to give us an introduction to Internet research
of our college’s online databases. While showing us an on screen information
sheet which had links to the campus Library’s databases he taught us how to
navigate the different Popular Proquest, JSTOR for example then showed us how
we could choose and identify popular essays or articles, even teaching us how to
copy and save or email articles to ourselves if wanted. (P9)
Mental Process
The mental process theme describes what sense participants made of their
research process. It included their thoughts and feelings about research, what they felt
they learned through the process, and what they would have done differently.
Thoughts and feelings about research. This sub-theme describes study
participants’ feelings about conducting academic research and thoughts on the research
activities. It includes two elements, Confidence and Required effort.
Confidence. Students varied in how confident they are about their research skills.
More than a few study participants appeared confident in their ability to locate
information for their research papers.

73
Considering that I have several years of college writing, I feel confident my
methods of research have worked for me. (P32)
I’m also not saying that I like research projects either, but I think I do them pretty
well. (P31)
I think I do just fine on my research assignments. (P17)
A few other students, however, were not as sure in their own research abilities.
My researching ways could be better. (P24)
Most of my experiences on conducting research for this class have been quite
frustrating for me because I’ve never really had knowledge on how to research
anything before coming to college. (P15)
Confidence seemed higher among students who have conducted research before.
Considering that I have several years of college writing, I feel confident my
methods of research have worked for me and I have become successful in
portraying my thoughts on paper. (P32)
Required effort. This element addresses nature of effort (i.e. easy or hard), degree
of difficulty, and time needed to complete research. Students varied in their descriptions
of whether research was difficult or easy for them. One group of students found the
assignment difficult and time consuming, another group found it easy, and the third found
it initially difficult but progressively easier. The first group of respondents characterized
their research experiences as difficult, hard or challenging.
I’ve noticed that my lack of research experience has made it very difficult for me
to research anything. (P22)
My experience with doing research has been anything but easy. (P7)
The assignments that he gave us where challenging and made my brain hurt a lot.
(P21)
In high school, I wrote a research paper about immigration and that was easy for
me, but the Muslim vs. the Islam paper was really hard for me. There wasn't
enough information about Islam vs Muslim. (P34)

74
Research papers are a lot of hard work and time consuming. (P31)
Although researching is often time consuming and sometimes difficult, I have
found that once all the information is finally compiled, it becomes very easy from
then on. (P26)
Some students expressed feelings of dread related to the research process.
English was one of my favorite subjects until I got into an English 1A class here
at Yuba College. Why do you ask that my love for English went astray? My love
for English quickly began to diminish after I was assigned my first college level
research paper. What is the big deal right? College level research papers should be
a piece of cake right? I thought so, but after being assigned one a week, the days
in-between each paper were usually miserable for me. (P26)
At this point in time I am not a fan of English at all but I really hate the thought of
a research assignment. (P8)
At the same time, another group of students characterized research as being not difficult
or even easy for them.
From my experience, I have learned that finding information can be fairly easy, as
long as the topic has ready resources, it is important to pick a subject you can
work with, as using a topic with minimal information available can be very
difficult and time consuming. (P12)
I have found that research is very easy with Google and I can go in depth with
certain aspects instead of reading an entire book and trying to work with it. (P10)
The research projects are not very difficult but they do make you think. (P25)
For some, research appeared difficult in the beginning but became easier with practice as
the class progressed.
As I continue to do more research on the Internet, it becomes much easier for me.
Doing researches on assignment that was hard at first, but after while it just
became a habit and it seemed natural to me. (P5)
Research papers are a lot of hard work and time consuming, however once a
scholar gets the hang of one it can actually become quite easy and even enjoyable.
(P31)
Research assignments in this class have been very challenging, which is good
because it has helped me develop certain research techniques I didn’t know of as
well as improve and expand my knowledge in this matter. (P6)

75
Lessons learned. The lessons learned subtheme describes what study participants
learned from their research experiences, and what they wish they would have done
differently. All students reported having learned something during the process of
completing research assignments. Looking for author biases, obtaining help when
needed, expanding types of resources used, and incorporating new research strategies
were mentioned the most.
Author bias. Virtually all study participants expressed the importance of looking
for author bias, despite the fact that finding this bias may have been a challenge for them.
I have found that .com websites and news stations have too much false
information. I try and stay away from the news depending on what station you are
listening to they all pretty much bias[ed]. (P2)
Another thing I learned was that I used to accept bias information as the truth and
unbiased information as slander, regularly getting the two mixed up. I now know
how to avoid these types of obstacles by keeping an open mind no matter how
convincing the information might be … now that I have acquired more knowledge
I know to read beyond what is there and look for bias and flawed information.
(P25)
Was I able to recognize bias or contradictions in information sources? It was hard
to recognize bias and contradictions in informational sources. I needed to read
and re-read in order to find out what they were saying and I still have that
problem but not as bad as when I first started the class. (P3)
The con to using the Internet was that I had to decipher on what websites seem to
be honest and clear about the topics it covered. Some articles that I found written
by certain authors seem to be bias towards one main subject. (P5)
I found that most of the papers we had had some bias themes to them, like hater
will take over America, or that global warming is the next black plague. I would
have to look at the essay and try to find out what the writers state of mind is.
(P21)
I have definitely changed the way in how I conduct a research paper. I used to fall
victim to the first article that I read and then go on to create a very biased opinion
about the subject matter, and failed to look for contradictions and the writers bias
though the material. Now, however, I am constantly asking the question “why”

76
whenever I conduct research, which I now believe is the most crucial question the
ask yourself when researching any topic you are given. (P26)
Students may have been so aware of the need to identify bias in information sources
because of the instructor’s emphasis on this issue. One study participant wrote, “After
taking English 1A, our professor has really challenged the students to finding and
evaluating information along with recognizing bias” (P32).
Benefits of getting help. In this section, students reflected on the benefits of
getting help and what they wanted from the library. Several students acknowledged that
getting help may have been beneficial to them, and that they should consider using
outside help in the future.
If I had to redo my search assignments I would probably seek the help needed to
learn the sources and techniques needed to write a research paper. (P22)
Next time I need to research I will go to the librarian and ask for help. (P16)
I would go and ask for help, more detailed help that ... just break it down like,
"This is where I'm at. I don't even know how .... I bought a computer and I don't
even really know how to work it”. (P33)
A couple of students expressed a wish that more research training would have been
available to English students.
For future projects I would like to learn how to use more tools to facilitate my
papers, and to try to make them as accurate as possible. (P4)
It would be great if English classes offered one whole class or half or two classes
on how to research and maybe bring in some people to help show students the
best way to go about researching for projects. Sometimes it seems we face a
research assignment and just have no clue where to start or what you can use as a
credible source that you end up just not doing it. I'm unsure if there is such a thing
as research workshops but I believe that it would be helpful for students who do
not know where to start or how to do research. (P8)

77
Since peoples lives are getting overly busy and the Internet seems to be a popular
growing tool if possible I believe online workshops on how to do research would
be great where someone could have the workshop on campus but also record it for
students online to be able to watch and learn if their schedules do not allow them
to attend. Personally if they were to do an online workshop for research I would
love to be the first to sign up and learn more about how to research smarter not
harder. (P8)
Expanding types of resources. Other participants admitted that they needed to
expand their options for finding credible sources and possibly use the online library.
I have discovered that Wikipedia is just one option for research and that there are
so many more places to obtain information. (P8)
I will, in future projects, make more of an effort to find books that I can get my
information from of rather than a web page. (P30)
In the future on research assignments I think it would be better if I used other
sources other than just the Internet. The Internet is a place where almost anyone
can voice their opinion, and there are other sources one could use that could
provide more truths and evidence. (P31)
I see that my life within my English class could’ve been a little easier if I
would’ve looked for more ways to research an assignment. (P31)
I would've used more resources like the library or try to get on portal again to use
the online library. (P34)
I think I am better prepared to write good essays than I have ever been before, and
I think I will use more of the library sources and get out of using Google so much.
(P14)
New research strategies. Some students learned more about how to evaluate
sources and find new resources for their research projects.
I discovered that sometimes the library can have information that may not be
online or just harder to find especially when you want to look back into the past.

The changes I need to make while researching is to head to a library and look up
things in print as well as online. I need to get myself to a library and read different
authors who took the time to write an entire book about this subject. That takes
dedication and their work definitely worth taking a peek at. (P24)

Results and Interpretations
This section summarizes the main results that emerged from the findings and
discusses the findings in light of the literature reviewed. The problem this study sought to
address was that little is known about how rural community college students conduct
research for their research assignments, even though previous empirical studies and
theoretical models attempted to describe college students’ research process in general.
Result 1: Students followed a process in order to complete their research
assignments. The research steps study participants took varied for different respondents;
yet all students mentioned searching for information, selecting and evaluating sources,
incorporating sources into writing, and citing references. Students had a mental map of
what they should be doing in the research process, and they shifted their concepts over
time. For example, many stated to have learned the importance recognizing author bias
during the course of English 1A class. Others stated that having completed the process,
they were more likely to use the library in the future, or ask for help with research.
Almost all students started research by using Google and the majority of the
students limited themselves to the Internet sources. This finding is common in
contemporary literature on student use of information resources (Biddix et al., 2011,
Griffith & Brody, 2005; Williams, 2006). About a quarter of the students mentioned also
using the library databases, mostly ProQuest. Numbers of students using the library vary
in different studies. Griffith and Brophy (2005) found low usage of library databases,
with no more than 45% of their respondents used databases at least occasionally and 55%
never using databases. These research findings contradict a number of other studies
where library use was higher. For example, 82% of students used library databases in

79
Thompson’s (2007) study, and over half of undergraduate students used library databases
on a regular basis in Foster and Gibbons’s (2007) study.
Students used the same self-styled website search and evaluation techniques as
those that worked for them in the past. However, these evaluation techniques were not
always sufficient for their academic research needs and included primarily comparing
website information and checking website URLs. These experiences seem typical for the
students in Head’s (2013) study.
Study participants’ information seeking behavior resembled three models presented
in the Literature Review in Chapter 2. Ellis’s (1989) six stage behavior model is
consistent with some of the findings in this research. Study participants conducted initial
searches, chained sources together by using Wikipedia as a resource, browsed for
additional sources, and used differences between sources in order to examine them.
However, they did not keep track of the new research on their topics, which Ellis (1989)
described in his Monitoring stage.
Dervin’s (2003) sense-making model, described as gap-bridging from unknown to
known through time and space, also seems to match what this study found. In this gap
bridging process, certain factors either expanded or reduced the gap between the need for
information and the information. Examples included students’ internal motivation or lack
thereof, barriers to research (such as lack of skills or issues with using technology, and
getting help from others. Dervin (2003) focused on an individual and the sense one
makes of the information gap when trying to cross it.
Additionally, study participants’ research steps seemed similar to Kuhlthau’s
(2004) six-stage Information Search Process. The students proceeded from Initiation

80
(becoming aware of the need for information), to Selection (choosing a general topic), to
Exploration (looking for sources), to Formulation (focusing research), to Collection
(gathering relevant sources), to Presentation (writing a research paper) steps. However,
unlike Kuhlthau’s (2004) study participants, the respondents in this study did not specify
their exact feelings and thoughts associated with each of the aforementioned steps.
Looking at the findings through a lens of the constructivist approach to
understanding information seeking, one can see evidence of student awareness, changes
in student thought process, and evidence of student critical thinking. These findings
seem to match Grassian and Kaplowitz’s (2009) statement that knowledge is created in
the learner’s mind, and Bowles-Terry et al.’s (2010) finding that information literacy is
achieved through a recursive process of applying research strategies rather than
mechanically following rules.
Information Science theorists commonly criticize the behaviorist approach to
understanding information literacy (Dervin, 2003; Kuhlthau, 2004). Instead, they
advocate for understanding information literacy through the lens of the constructivist
paradigm. In her recent study, Dixon-Thomas (2012) found that librarians teach
information literacy from the behaviorist perspective, by training students on procedures
for finding information in an acceptable order and evaluating sources with checklists.
From a behaviorist standpoint this study’s participants did not exhibit the behaviors
traditionally associated with information literate individuals, and therefore lack
information literacy skills. Simmons (2005) promoted the “critical information literacy”
concept, which suggests incorporating critical thinking skills into library research
instruction (p. 299). The present study’s participants seemed to gain some critical

81
thinking skills after taking their English 1A course, as demonstrated in their statements
about the importance of identifying author biases.
Result 2: Students struggled with finding, evaluating, and using sources for
their research papers. Students reported feeling overwhelmed by the variety and vast
amount of information for their research assignments. Establishing credibility, finding
author bias, and choosing best sources for their papers were particularly challenging. For
the majority of students, search strategies were limited to basic Google searching.
Further, incorporating sources into student writing and creating citations in MLA format
presented additional challenges. Issues with technology and access to the library
resources seemed to contribute to these difficulties.
This result mirrors findings from a recent study by Head (2013), a part of the multiyear Project Information Literacy. Similarly to high-school and college students
surveyed by Head (2013), the participants in the present study demonstrated a “Googlecentric” (p. 27) approach to research. Study participants followed self-styled research
steps and strategies to get their projects completed. Students’ skills appeared somewhat
effective as researchers, but not for college-level research. They used certain limited
techniques to evaluate their sources (such as domain addresses and site comparison).
McClure and Clink (2009) also found that students primarily limited their evaluation
techniques to checking website and domain names. In other words, the information
seeking process seemed common to the members of “the Google generation” (Head,
2013, p. 33).
Additionally, whereas Head (2013) found that generating effective online searches
was the most common difficulty experienced by freshman students, participants in this

82
study did not mention figuring out keywords, formulating efficient online searches, or
even being aware of different ways of searching. Instead, they listed evaluating sources,
addressing technological issues, and incorporating sources into writing as particularly
challenging. It is also interesting to note that while Head (2013) found that her students
floundered with reading and comprehending scholarly materials, the participants in this
study predominantly struggled with identifying author bias.
Respondents recognized the importance of evaluating sources and establishing
authority and credibility, which is consistent with Head and Eisenberg’s (2010) and
McClure and Clink’s (2009) findings. However, in contrast to this research, the students
in McClure and Clink’s (2009) study were not concerned with identifying author biases.
Similarly to Head’s (2013) findings, students in the present study expressed frustrations
when looking for credible information and evaluating their sources. As in the present
study, Silva (2011) found that students evaluated their sources only superficially, and
used searching techniques that they had been previously familiar with. According to
Judd and Kennedy (2011), medical students focused on Google and Wikipedia as their
primary sources of information because they lacked skills necessary to conduct research
using the online library. This might have been the case with students in the present study
as well.
Similarly to Judd and Kennedy (2011) and Griffith and Brophy (2005), the
students in this study preferred convenience over quality when seeking information. Just
like Kim and Sim’s (2007) respondents, participants in this research seemed aware that
library databases offered more credible sources than website research. Students saw the
benefit of using library databases to find more credible sources and to cite sources

83
(similar to findings by Appleton, 2006; Avdic and Eklund, 2010). Yet at the same time,
merely a quarter of respondents used them. On the other hand, Thompson (2007) found
that distance students used library resources as much as they did Google, which was not
the case in the present study.
According to a traditional library science definition, the information literate
individual “must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to
locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information” (American Library
Association, 1989, para. 1). Most of the students in this study demonstrated some level
of information literacy as they were able to complete the requirements for research
assignments. However, study participants struggled with four of Doyle’s (1992) ten
learning outcome measures on information literacy: 1) developing successful search
strategies, 2) accessing sources of information including computer based and other
technologies, 3) evaluating information, and 4) organizing information for practical
application. From the behaviorist standpoint, this result indicates that students lack
information literacy skills needed for college-level research. The ability to find, evaluate,
and use effectively the needed information are all qualities of information literate
individuals.
It appears that students’ information literacy skills assessment varies depending on
whether a researcher uses behaviorist or constructivist models of information literacy.
When Bowles-Terry et al. (2010) examined 43 information literacy tutorials created by
librarians, they discovered that these tutorials included checklists to help students with
evaluating their sources. Although none of the students in this study used checklists in
order to select their sources, they seemed to have some idea about how to evaluate

84
sources. For example, some looked for trustworthiness, while others considered
relevancy or biases. At the same time, nobody verbalized a list of all the criteria one may
need to consider when evaluating online references.
One of the reasons students described research as challenging was due to
technology issues. Study participants used a variety of electronic devices to conduct
research, including personal computers, laptops, and smart phone. Their difficulties
ranged from unreliable to access to library resources via the college portal, to library
links being non-operational, to computer hardware issues, to challenges of conducting
research on a smart phone.
Issues with using technology are not commonly listed in the library literature as
the key reason for college students finding research to be challenging, or choosing not to
use library resources. This finding could be unique to rural community college students,
who may still have limited or no Internet access at home. Additionally, the college itself
may have limited resources to make technology more easily accessible. Examples could
include providing laptops for student use, extending library hours for easier access to the
computer lab, simplifying the access to the College portal, or making it easier for
authenticate student access to library databases.
At the same time, students’ lack of technological skills could be a contributing
factor to study participants’ issues with using technology. Marcum (2002) posits that
“sociotechnical fluency” (p. 1) goes beyond text-based information literacy, and should
include other types of literacies, such as technological literacy. In other words, training
students on how to be able to trouble shoot issues with technology might make them

85
more proficient in using online research tools, including computer software and
hardware, and various electronic devices.
Result 3. Students did not seek help at any point in the research process. The
majority of study participants did not ask for help from anyone, with two exceptions
which were the requests for the instructor to clarify assignments. Even those respondents
that acknowledged they could have benefited from getting assistance still did not ask for
help. This finding aligns with Head and Eisenberg’s (2013) study, in which the authors
found students not asking for help, relying on their own skills and knowledge instead.
Head and Eisenberg (2013) found that first year college students were frequently guided
by the so-called “freshmen-myths” (p. 19), which included a belief that college work
required one to be self-sufficient, and asking for help from an instructor, a tutor, or a
librarian was a sign of failure. Another “freshmen myth” was that research assistance in
the library was a high specialized service and was simply not for them.
This finding contradicts Head and Eisenberg’s (2010) previous study of different
college students. Head and Eisenberg found in 2010 that research evaluation was a
collaborative process, with 61% of college students frequently asking for help from
friends and family members when evaluating information, 49% asking for assistance
from their instructors, and 11% obtaining help from librarians.
The most frequently stated reason for not getting help was self-reliance, followed
by being too busy with other commitments and being embarrassed about needing help.
Most students did their research independently, with only two students asking the
instructor for help. The reasons students did not ask for help varied from self-reliance, to
lack of time, to being afraid to ask for help. Hardly anybody mentioned librarians as a

86
potential source of research help, which in part could be due to a belief that library
research assistance is not for regular students.
Summary
Chapter 4 described research findings, illustrated through participants’ voices, and
discussed them through the lens of the three literature streams from Chapter 2. Three
major themes are outlined in the findings section as follows: 1) Research Process, 2)
Library and Help, and 3) Mental Process. Five additional subthemes were identified. The
following results are included: 1) Students struggled with finding, evaluating, and using
sources for their research papers; 2) Respondents followed an established process in order
to complete their research assignments; 3) Study participants did not seek help
throughout their research process.

Chapter 5: Conclusion and Recommendations
Introduction
The purpose of this research study was to uncover the experiences of rural
community college students conducting research for academic papers for a transfer-level
composition course. The researcher was looking for subjective accounts of these student
experiences with a focus on the research processes, resource selection and evaluation
techniques, and research challenges. This topic is relevant because an in-depth
understanding of this phenomenon could enable rural community college librarians and
English instructors to use more innovation in teaching and enable them to better support
students. The qualitative case study research collected data through student reflective
essays, as well as individual and focus group interviews. Reflective essays and interview
transcripts were coded and analyzed for emerging patterns and themes. The reflective
essays prompts and interview protocols focused on students’ previous experiences with
conducting research, such as specific research steps, source evaluation criteria, feelings
about research, and the use of the library resources. Findings included three themes: 1)
the Research Process, 2) Help and Library Use, and 3) Thoughts and Feelings about
research. Based on the findings, three results emerged: 1) Students followed a process in
order to complete their research assignments; 2) Students struggled with finding,
evaluating, and using sources for their research papers; 3) Students did not seek help
throughout the research process. This closing chapter presents conclusions, answers the
research questions that framed this study, and offers recommendations for practical action
and future research.

88
Conclusions
Understanding individual experiences of students conducting research for
academic papers was the primary focus of this research study. The research questions
posed in this study were:
Research Question 1: What are the Yuba College English 1A
students’ research experiences when creating academic research papers?
This study uncovered an array of student research experiences. Study participants
addressed their academic research needs similarly to how they solve their information
needs in daily life. The initial search process was similar in that they used Google, but it
differed in that they were focused on credibility and bias, and particularly whether the
sources had academic credibility. Students used a variety of resources, with some
respondents combining different types of resources, and others turning to Google and the
Internet exclusively both for convenience and out of habit. A third of respondents
integrated Wikipedia in their research process, either for background information or as a
direct source, while a quarter of respondents also used the online library databases at least
to some extent, mostly ProQuest.
Students conducted their research activities mostly on their personal computers or
laptops at home or on the library computers. Several students conducted research on their
smartphones. Difficulties with using electronic devices and accessing the online library
through the college portal were commonly listed frustrations for students in this rural
college.
Study participants conducted their research independently, without assistance
from librarians, the writing center, the instructor, or their classmates. A few individuals

89
sought help with understanding the assignment, but not research assistance. Students
acted with self-reliance even though many reported difficulty finding and evaluating
sources, incorporating sources into writing, and citing materials. Study participants
generally remembered attending a library research session in the beginning of the course;
however, they varied in how much information from the presentation they were able to
recollect. Students also varied in how much of the new knowledge from the library
session they chose to apply to their research strategies.
Research question 2: What processes do students follow when conducting
academic research?
Students had a mental map that guided them through their research. They felt that
they knew what they were supposed to do to complete research assignments. While the
research process varied by each student, they performed a series of steps, which typically
began with seeking information, followed by selecting sources, evaluating information,
weeding out sources, incorporating sources into writing, and concluding with citing
sources. Student research processes, while detailed, were not sophisticated. When using
the Internet, searching techniques were limited to simple searching, and often did not
extend past using the search engine and Wikipedia.
Study participants indicated that their research process taught them a number of
lessons. They realized that it was essential to identify author bias and critically think
about their sources. Some saw that their existing search and evaluation strategies had
been limited, and wished to learn more about this subject. Others expressed a need to
expand their research choices to include online library databases and other scholarly
resources. Yet another group stated a desire to consult a librarian for future assignments.

90
Overall, one could argue that student thinking about research shifted as a result of
completing their composition course writing assignments.
Research question 3: How do students choose and evaluate their sources?
After conducting their initial searches, students evaluated and selected their
sources based on credibility. Students relied on techniques that they thought worked for
them in the past to choose their sources. They seemed guided by familiarity and
convenience when selecting what resources to use. As experienced Google searchers,
they were accustomed to the Google interface and the Google research experience.
Respondents relied heavily on information found on Google. They tried to find
“unbiased” and “credible” sources while managing their limitations, such as the lack of
available time and limited knowledge and experience with research.
The study participants did not reference using advanced searching, website
directories, journal repositories, or other scholarly Google sources. Nor, moreover, did
they specify looking for relevant keywords or appropriate subject terms to conduct their
searches. Students also did not describe composing successful search queries. None of the
participants specified differences among various types of sources, such as scholarly
versus popular sources, or primary versus secondary versus tertiary sources. Most
students did not distinguish among books, encyclopedias, websites, scholarly articles,
peer review articles, or newspapers. The most commonly named resource was Internet
websites.
The fact that all students reported challenges around evaluating sources indicated
a prevalent deficiency of website evaluation skills. In general, students appeared to lack
understanding of different types of sources and ways to evaluate them. The majority of

91
students were not clear about how to evaluate their sources beyond the basics (such as
examining the domain name of the website). According to a well-established definition,
the information literate individual “must be able to recognize when information is needed
and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information”
(American Library Association, 1989, para.1). Most of the students in this study
demonstrated a certain level of information literacy as they were able to pass the class,
but the effectiveness of their self-styled strategies for academic research is somewhat
questionable.
Research question 4: What challenges and frustrations might they
encounter?
Students identified the following research tasks as most difficult: coping with a
variety and amount of information on the Internet, evaluating materials, incorporating
sources into writing, and citing sources. Access to resources due to technological
difficulties presented another noteworthy challenge for some respondents.
A majority of the respondents stated that they were challenged by evaluating
sources, particularly establishing credibility and finding biases. Choosing authoritative
and unbiased materials from a vast selection of sources available on the Internet was
overwhelming to many respondents. As study participants used familiar evaluation
strategies, they often found that these techniques were insufficient for academic collegelevel research. Further, after students found materials acceptable to them, they wrestled
with incorporating them into research papers. Finally, MLA style formatting presented
yet another difficulty.

92
The fact that study participants struggled with finding, evaluating, using, and citing
sources reflects lack of proficiency in four of Doyle’s (1992) ten learning outcome
measures on information literacy: 1) developing successful search strategies, 2) accessing
sources of information including computer based and other technologies, 3) evaluating
information, and 4) organizing information for practical application. Thus students’ lack
of information literacy skills needed for college-level research caused them to experience
some of the aforementioned research challenges and frustrations.
Technological problems involved accessing library resources via the college
Portal and issues with electronic devices used to access resources for research.
Technology seemed to define types of resources students chose to use. For example,
difficulties with the Portal pushed students to give up or not even attempt to use the
online library databases. The inability to use library databases on one’s smart phone was
another deterrent.
Recommendations
Based on the findings, results, and conclusions, the research makes the following
future practice recommendations for librarians, instructors, and community colleges. The
section closes with recommendations for future research.
Recommendations for librarians
Librarians should consider students’ existing searching strategies and research
practices when providing research instruction in the classroom, in the library, and during
one-on-one research consultations. Additionally, librarians managing electronic

93
subscriptions need to be mindful of the ways in which students use technology to conduct
research. The researcher recommends the following for librarians:
1. Expand library instruction to include successful search queries, keyword versus
subject searching, types of resources best suited for different types of research
questions, and resource evaluation techniques. Knowing the students tend to use
familiar and self-styled research techniques, librarians should highlight
similarities and differences between Google searching and online library database
searching, and build upon students’ existing knowledge during instruction.
2. Offer workshops on additional topics that students identified as challenging, such
as evaluating online resources and citing sources. Although findings demonstrated
that respondents needed supplementary help in these areas, students may not take
advantage of this service as they tend to work independently and value selfreliance. Thus to encourage student participation, librarians could encourage
instructors to offer extra-credit to student participants for attending such
workshops or to bring the entire class to participate during an assigned class time.
3. Demonstrate database searching on a variety of electronic devices. Being mindful
that students use an array of devices to conduct academic research, librarians
could incorporate the use of new technologies into the library instruction by
offering hands-on training on students’ personal laptops and smartphones.
4. Demonstrate remote access to library databases in person and via video tutorials.
Librarians could also encourage students to bring their own devices when meeting
with librarians for research help or library workshops. This would enable
librarians to help students in case they experience difficulties with database

94
access. At the same time, librarians would become more aware of what exactly is
and is not working for students.
5. Improve anonymous research help options. This suggestion could help students
who need assistance but are embarrassed to ask for help. An anonymous research
help box could include an anonymous process for submitting research requests,
such as anonymous online form, online discussion forum, or even a form one
could leave at the reference desk for pick up later.
6. Better promote library resources and services to instructors and students. While
findings demonstrated that there was some evidence of library promotion as
students tended to remember having a librarian visit their class, library promotion
may have been insufficient. Some students might not have used databases and
research help simply because they had not thought about doing it. Additionally, if
librarians are able to persuade instructors to place larger emphasis on using the
library resources and obtaining research help, instructors might incorporate it as a
requirement for students, which would lead to increased library use.
7. Add a single search interface to access library content. This search engine will
simplify students’ library database research experience to resemble Google. A
number of unified search interfaces could accomplish this task, including
Discovery, Summons, QuickSearch, and AquaBrowser, among others. A single
search box through a library search engine would enable library users to find
results from most of the Library’s journal databases and catalog holdings.
Realizing that students are guided by convenience and search for familiarity,

95
introducing a single search interface may encourage more students to use online
library resources.
8. Improve off-campus access to the library databases. Librarians need to work
closely with the Information Technology staff in order to improve and simplify
database access. If technical glitches associated with using the college portal
cannot be resolved, librarians should change how library databases are accessed
off-campus. Proxy servers and virtual private networks are solutions for a single
sign-on remote user authentication commonly used by research libraries.
9. Report the findings of this study on campus and at the state level, including other
community college librarians and professional associations.
Recommendations for instructors
Academic librarians’ interactions with students are limited to those students who
approach them for research help. Therefore, instructors are uniquely positioned to help a
much greater number of students to grow and develop as researchers. Based on the study
findings and results, the researcher recommends the following for instructors:
1. Include detailed procedures for selecting, evaluating and citing sources with
research assignment prompts. While instructors may encourage students to use
library resources, they do not always require that students use the library.
Research assignments could include information about the variety of information
resources and source formats available to students, including online and print
sources.
2. Discuss the nature of the research process with students. Students need to be
aware that research is an iterative process, and the more they conduct research the

96
better they are able to analyze, evaluate, and apply their selected sources, and the
more they understand the research process itself. Therefore, students should not
merely try to remember what types of sources to use, but also through repeating
their experiences they will learn to understand the differences among them,
compare, contrast, and evaluate them.
3. Facilitate class discussions about source evaluation techniques. In those
circumstances when it is not feasible to add formal source evaluation assignments,
informal discussions and information sharing could also be beneficial to
composition students.
4. Require students to evaluate their cited sources as part of the research
assignments. For example, instructors could ask students to annotate their sources
prior to composing research papers. Such an exercise would enable students to
practice their source evaluation skills while allowing instructors to understand
more about students’ evaluation practices.
5. Help to change students’ mental model that research should be conducted
independently. Students demonstrating self-reliance may not ask for help as long
as they believe that they are supposed to work on their own. Instructors could
either offer students extra credit in the course for attending research consultations,
or repeatedly emphasize the value and importance of seeking research assistance.
6. Schedule time in the computer lab for students to practice their research skills.
Instructors could also encourage students to bring their own electronic devices
(laptops, smart phones, etc). Research sessions in the computer lab would allow

97
instructors both to guide students through the research process and to address
challenges with access and the use of technology.
Recommendations for community colleges
College libraries do not operate independently of colleges, and are highly
dependent on their parent institutions to implement changes. Therefore, much of what
librarians are able to accomplish in academic libraries depends on the support of the
college administration. Based on the study findings and results, the researcher
recommends the following for community colleges:
1. Expand the ways information literacy is taught in college. Findings demonstrated
that one transfer-level composition course may not be sufficient for students to
become proficient in academic research. Examples could include offering
introductory level courses on conducting effective college research, providing
library research orientations for new students, including information literacy skills
curriculum in subject specific disciplines, or creating a research skills sequence in
the curriculum for composition courses.
2. Increase library staffing and funding levels to upgrade library resources. In order
to implement innovations listed in the recommendations for librarians, such as
proxy servers, a single search interface, or improved portal access, librarians need
to have adequate levels of financial and human resources.
3. Increase library staffing and funding levels to expand and promote library
services, and collaborate with subject-specific instructors. This will also include
funding for any additional workshop curriculum development and delivery
discussed in the recommendations for librarians.

98
4. Encourage collaboration between instructors and librarians across campus.
Support from the academic leadership, such as department chairs, deans, vice
presidents of instruction, and the Academic Senate, are essential for promoting
and energizing this discussion.
Recommendations for future research
1. The results of this study are limited by the fact that study participants were all
enrolled in sections of the same course taught by the same instructor at one rural
community college in California. These limitations create possibilities for a range
of future research studies as follows:
i) Replicate this study in other composition courses conducted by other
instructors.
ii) Replicate this study in courses taught by instructors in other disciplines, such
as science and social science courses.
iii) Replicate this study at other rural community colleges.
iv) Replicate this study at urban community colleges.
2. The findings of this study indicated that students are using new mobile electronic
devices for their research assignments. A study of student experiences while
completing research on their smart phones and using various research apps could
be beneficial.
Summary
Chapter 5 presented conclusions, answered the research questions that formed the
basis for this study, and offered recommendations for practical actions for librarians,

99
instructors, and community colleges. The chapter closed with suggestions for future
research.
It is the researcher’s hope that librarians and instructors will be able to utilize this
study to better understand information seeking behaviors of rural transfer-level
community college students enrolled in composition courses. The researcher hopes that
findings, results, conclusions and recommendations presented here will offer a positive
contribution to the community colleges’ mission of preparing information competent
lifelong learners.

resources to explore.
1. What specific library search tools (if any) did you use and why did you choose

them?
2. Is there a particular tool that you felt was invaluable to your research during the

creation of this project?
Sources: Selection and evaluation of resources available.
3. How deeply or widely did you explore your topic area before deciding on your

specific sources?
4. How did you evaluate your selected materials?
5. How much of your research was done independently? Did you seek and/or receive

guidance from others in how to locate or best utilize the resources available to
you?
Putting it All Together: Ways in which you used the sources you discovered to support
your thesis or argument.
6. What did you learn about finding and evaluating information on your topic?
7. Were you able to recognize bias or contradictions in information sources? How

did you balance these viewpoints with your own?

109
What You Learned: Your understanding of research and how you may have grown or
changed as an independent researcher.
8. What problems or obstacles (if any) did you encounter while working on your
research assignments?
9. What have you learned about your own style of research, or what changes might
you make when researching future projects?
