(a) Density

These nine parameters will give a
reasonable comparison betweer: :he systems,
since they represent a printing system's main
output characteristics.
The measurements were done using a
Gretag Dl96 densitometer, (with the Status T
Standard and polarization filters), for all the
parameters except the colour gamuts and
reflective curve$, for which a Gretag
Spectrolino spectrophotometer was used,
with the illuminant D65, observer angle 2, DIN
standards.

.

The measurements were done using a
black backgroiind, as stated in the ISQ
standards, and using the papers' white as the
refereilce white, i17 order to aii~ninate any
effects caused by the used papers' colouring
and surface characteristics on the evaluation
of the printed ink (or toner) film tt-ni~kness.~

Reflection density of a print is the
measurement of the amount of ink (or loner)
laid down on paper (or substrate) by a press.
The solid densities of the 4-process colour
patches of the 12 systems were measured
(Figure 1).

(b) Dot Gain
Dot gain is the difference in the dot area
measurements from the film or digits! file to
the printed image. The dot gain of the
4-process colours (Cyan, Magenta, Yeilow,
and blacK) (CMYK) of the 12 systems were
measured, at the solid, 8O0/0, and 40%
halftone patches (Figures 2 and 3) using the
Murray-Davis equation.
(c) Characteristic Curves
The characteristic curve is the relationship
between the dot percentages on the film (or
digital file) and those on the final print. The
dot areas of the 4-process col~urs(ZILIYK) of
the 12 systems were measured (Figure 4).

(d) Contrast
The print contrast is the measurement (on
a scale of 0-100%) of the ability of the printing

process to hold shadow detail. It compares
the density of a solid patch with that of a
halftone patch, which is usually a 75%
screen. The contrast of the 4-process colours
(GMYK) of the 12 systems was measured
(Figure 5).

(el Trapping
Trapping is the measurement (on a scale
of 0-100%) of the ink (or toner) adhesion on a
previously- printed ink or toner film.3 The
trapping of the three-overprint colour patches,
Blue, re& and Red, of the 12 systems were
measured (Figure 6).
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23(1)

(f)

Hue Error

The Hue error value indicates the variat~on
and deviation (on a scale of 0-100%) of the
measured ink (or toner) colour frorn the
theoretically perfect one. Figure 7 shows the
hue error of the three process colours (CMY)
of the 12 systems.
(g) Grayness

The Grayness value indicates the
grayness (gray component) and darkness
variation (on a scale of 0-100Â°/b), between the
measured ink (or toner) and the ideal ones.

Colour Gamuts

Colour gamut is the total range of colours
that can be reproduced with a given set of
inks (or other colorants) on a given paper
stock and a given printing press (or other
colour output) configuration.'
The data here was presented In the CIE
L*a*b* space. The L*a*b* values of the six
basic colour patches (CMYRGB) of the 12
systems were measured (Figure 10).

offset litho Standards will not be appropriate
since the systems and their consumables are
different. However still we'll be referring in
some cases to the is0 12647-2 Standard as
a comparison guide, since it is the most
widely accepted international standard, and
the most related one to the tests we've done
using CMYK files without any colour
transformations, which is the usual, every day
production method in general offset litho
printing.
(a) Density

The density measurements show that:

+

All the (C) colour density readings, with the
exception of those of Infocolor 70, DCP

--

DESIDOC Bullebn of Inf Technol,2003,23(1)

32/D,and GTO, were higher than the one
recommended by the ISC (1.45).
The nearest to the standard was SM 52
(1.47).

+ As for the (M) colour, the density readings
were closer to the I S 0 Standard, where the
CLC density reading was exactly as the
recommended one (1.4).

The density readings of the (Y) colour
were overall the best compared to the IS0
Standard, where Dl had exactly the
recommended value (1). All the results
except those of Dl and Adast were less than
the standard.

4 As for the (K) colour, all the density readings
except those of the SM 52, GTO and Dl,
were higher than the standard (1.75). The
closest to the standard was SM 52 (1.72).
The overall balance between the densities
of four colours for each system was different,
in most cases, from the standard's
recommended one. The density values can
be altered through the software of the front
ends and RIPS.

(b) Dot Gain
The (C) colour's dot gain values at the
40% halftone patch, except that of DCP, were
48

not within the tolerance range (12% to 20%)
recommended by the I S 0 standard. The dot
gains of only CLC (22%) and Chromapress
(21%) were higher than the recommended
standard. At the 80% patch, only InfoColor.
Chromapress and DocuColor 40 were with~n
the range (9% to 15%).
For the (M) colour, at the 40% patch, DCP,
Infocolor and DocuColor 40 were within the
range with DocuColor 40 being the closest to
the target.

values at the end of it indicating that some of
the dots were not printed on the paper at this
area.

DCP, Chromapress, DocuColor 40, Adast and
Oce' were within the range with Adast being
the target- All the rest were
the closest
lower than the range.

GTO was the closest to the ideal linear
curve.

At the 80% patch, only Chromapress, Oce'
,
and Adast were within the range.
For the (K) colour, at the 40% patch, DCP,
Chromapress and DocuColor 40 and Adast
were within the range, with DCP being the
closest to the target. E-Print again was the
lowest (1YO).
At the 80% patch, Dl, InfoColor, DCP and
Chromapress were within the range.
Chromapress had exactly the target value.
The relation between the 40% and 80%
patches' dot gain values for each system was
different, some had both values equal, and
others had the first or second value higher.
Dot gain values can be altered through the
RIP of the systems.
(c) Characteristic Curves

For the (C) colour, Chromapress had the
highest values at the first half of the curve
while CLC had the highest at the second half
of the curve reaching its peak at 60%.
The rest of the systems were nearly the
same, except that E-Print had very low values
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2003, 23(1)

For the (M) colour, Chromapress had the
highest values at the first quarter of the curve,
while Oce' and CLC had the highest at the
rest of the curve, reaching its peak between
60% and 70%.
E-Print had the lowest values, which were
again very low at the very beginning of the
curve.
As for the (Y) colour, Chromapress had
the highest values at the first 213 of the curve,
while CLC had the highest at the last 113 of it,
reaching its peak at 70%.
CLC had the lowest values at the very
beginning of the curve, which were even
lower than the linear 45" curve, indicating that
some of the dots were not printed on the
paper at this area.
For the (K) colour, Chromapress had the
highest values at the first quarter of the curve,
while Oce' had the highest at the rest 314 of
it, reaching its peak between 60% and 80%.
DocuColor 40 had the lowest values at the
very beginning of the curve, which were even
lower than the linear curve, indicating again
that some of the dots were not printed on the
paper at this area.

(d) Contrast
From the contrast, it was clear that all the
contrast values were higher than the
maximum ones of SWOP standald's
recommendations, except the CLC and dce'
'.' ones, where CLC had lower (M) and (Y)
contrasts, and the Oce' had lower (M) and (K)
contrasts.
The lower contrast of CLC and b c e * is
correlated to its high dot gain values.
Here, we are referring to the SWOP
standards instead of the I S 0 ones, where
contxast vaiues are not mentioned in the later,
since it is in a way representing the same
information as the dot galn.
(K) colour contrast was overall the highest,
with ten of the twel\~esystems over (50%), (C)
was second with nine systems over (50%),
1 (M) third with six systems over (50%), and (Y)
' the lowest with only one system over (50%).
Changing the dot gain values, through the
RIPS and software used, can change contrast
values.
(e) Trapping ,
I
The range for the Blue colour was from
68% for SM 52, to 97% for E-Print.
For the Green colour, the range was <from
76% for Adast, to 99Y0for Oce..
As for the Red colcur, the range was from
65% fcr Adast, to 100% for E-Print and
DocuColcr 70.
Overall, the Red colour's trapping was the
best, with seven out of twelve systems having
over 90% trap. All of the electrophotcsgraphic
systems' Blue and most of Red c o ~ o u f straps
~
were higher than the offset litho, Dl and Adast
syste'ms, reflecting the greater adhbsion of
dry toner on previously printed layers, as
compared to the lower wet-on-wet adhesion
of ink f ~ l m s . ~
Adast had the overall lowest values, while
E-Print had the overall highest.
(f)

Hue Error

Magenta colours had the highest error in
all the systems with all of them (except CLC
and Oce') being over 40%.

Cyan colours were second, the range
beingz16%for CLC to 24% for both DCP and
Infocolor 70.
~ g l l o wcolours were the best, with all the
dry toner based systems below 5%, the
E-Print and Adast were 6% the GTO and SM
52 were 8%, and the Dl 10%.

(g) Grayness
Magenta colours had again the higher
values, ranging from 4% for the Adast to 20%
for DocuColor 70.
Cyan colours were second w ~ t h less
grayness, ranglng from 8% to 10%.
Yellow colours were the best, with all the
systems less than 5%, the Chromapress,
DocuColor 40 and 70, Adast, DCP being only
1%.
(h) Spectral Reflectance Curves

'

In the (K) colour curves, there were almost
no differences between the twelve systems.
Only the Chromapress had a hisher
reflectance at the 400 - 420 nm area.
In the (C) colour curves, there were lrttle
differences between the systems.
Again the Chromapress had a slight (a
gradual 10%) increase in its reflectance
between the 400 - 420 nrn area
The SM 52 and GTO had a tiigner
reflectance in the range frorn 500 - 590 K i n
As for the (M) colour curves. there were
also little differences between the systems
within the 630 - 700 nm area.
In the (Y) colour curves, there were little
differences between the systems within the
550 - 700 nm area, where the Dl was the
lowest. Also within the 400 - 480 nm area, the
systems were still close to each other.
the
The
increasing
reflection
of
Chromapress within the 400 - 420 nm area in
all colours, was because of a fhorescence
effect, whicti was inspected under UV light.

Colour Gamuts
The Lightness (L*) values were all veryclose
to the I S 0 Standard recornrnencidtions.

The l~ghtnessvalues of the Red colour
were overall the best w ~ t honly a maxlrnum
d~fferenceof 5 from the I S 0 Standard. The
-

largest difference was that of the Green
colour, with a maximum difference of 11.

+
/

+

The Chroma (C*) values of the (C) colour
were overall the best with only a maxlmum
difference of 5.5 from the I S 0 Standard. The
largest difference was again that of the
Green colour with a maximum difference of
19.
The Hue angles (h*) of the (Y) colour were
overall the best with only a maximum of 3"
difference from the I S 0 Standard. The
largest difference was again that of the
Gr&n colour, with a maximum dlfference of
22".

From the colour gamuts' comparison chart,
(Figure l o ) , most of the above results were
clear. It can also be seen that:

+
+
+

CLC had the largest gamut in the (Blue), (M),
(G) to (C) and (G) to (Y) areas.
DocuColor 40 had the largest gamut in the
(Y) to (R), and (R) to (M) areas.
Dl had the smallest gamut in the (Y) to (G)
area.
r

Most of the dot gain values were outside
the I S 0 tolerance range.
(c) Characteristic Curves

Some of the systems, l ~ k ethe E-Print (In
C, M and Y colours), CLC (in M and Y
colours), had some of the dots missing at
their lower (0 - 20%) halftone patches, and
the E-Print had the same at its higher (C) and
(M) (90% - 100%) halftone patches.

(d) Contrast
All contrast values were higher than those
recommended by SWOP, except those of the
CLC's (M) and (Y) colours.
(e) Trapping
All the (B) and most of the (R) colours'
trapping values of the digital systems were
higher than the offset litho ones.
Overall the (R) colour trap was the best.

ir

All of thegigital (G), (Y) and (R) colours,
most of the (C) and (M) colours, some of the
(B) colofirs were out of the offset litho colour
E* values were measured
which are the colour deviations and
differences between each of the six primary
and secondary colours (CMYRGB) of the
twelve systems and those of the I S 0 12647-2
standard.
From the 72 colours measured, only 6 had
an acceptable below 5 AE* values.
A majority of 29 colours had values
between 5 -10 AE* which is more than the
acceptable value. Ail the rest had AE* values
over 10, which is much more than the
accepted value.

2.3 Summary of Results
From the previous drscussions we can
conclude the-following:
(a)

(b) Dot Gain

Density

Most of the (K), (C) and (M) densit~eswere
h~gherthan those of the IS0 standard while
most of the (Y) ones were lower.
DESIDOC Bulletin of !nf Technol, 2003. 23(1)

(f)

Hue Error and Grayness

(M) colours had the highest hue error arid
grayness values in all systems while (Y)
colours were the lowest.
(g) Spectral Reflectance Curves

(K) and (C) spectral curves of all systems
were similar to each other with an overail
maximum reflection d~fferenceof 10%
The
fluorescence
effect
in
the
Chromapress four colours' reflectance curves
was significant.
(h) Colour Gamuts

(R) colours were the closest to the iSO
standard in lightness, while (C) colours were
the closest in chroma, and (Y) colours ~nhue
angles. (G) colours were the worst In all three
parameters.
The colour gamuts of these d ~ g ~ l a l
systems, which were mostly larger than those
of the I S 0 standard's, can be mapped and
matched to those of the later, by using the
latest colour management software
Since the above ment~oned parameters
are not the only measures In comparli-ig the
output qual~ty, some prel~minary vis ~ a l

assessments were also made on the test
prints. The results are as follow:

o Contouring was acceptable in all the
systems except in CLC and DocuCoior 40.
o Text production for the Helvetica light and
bold was produced perfectly even with the
3-point letters. The same was true for the
Helvetica bold reversed letters. With the
Helvetica light reversed letters, the 3-point
letters were partially filled-in with all the
systems with E-Print being nearly
covpletely filled-in .
o he theoretical width of the smallest
depictable lines were: 8 microns for both the
SM 52 and the GTO, 20 for both the Dl and
the Adast, 31 for E-Print, 42 for DCP,
Chromapress, Infocolor and DocuColor 70,
63 for DocuColor 40, and 64 for both the
CLC and the Oce'.

Visual assessr"ent and acceptability tests
were done on the previously compared
printed samples by the final users. Since the
buyer of a poster, for example, will not
measure the printing parameters. What he or
she will do wiil be picking up the m6st
pleasing and appealing prints from his or her
point of view.
The fluman eye will, at the end of the day,
be the final examiner, tester and decider of
the best pleasing printing results of these
different systems.

E print

The prints used in the previous
comparison tests were shown to a panel of
twenty observers who have different printing
and colour backgrounds and who have been
working in the British and Egyptian printing
industries.
First they were asked to rank the prints
from the best (most pleasing and appealing)
to the worst. Then, in order to determine the
visual acceptability of each system, they were
asked to specify if each of them is accepted
or not, as a match to an Agfa PressMatch Dr),
proof of the same file, prepared from the
colour separated films. Both the films and the
proof were very prepared by Agfa UK. All the
assessments were done under D50 standard
illumination.

Figure 12 shows the relation between both
the visual ranking and acceptability results.

The lowest visually assessed ones (Oce',
CLC and Chromapress) were the worst in
matching the proof, but with a slight change in
their sequence.

Discussion of Results

From the visual assessments of the twenty
observers, it can be seen that Indigo had the
best (highest) overall pleasing results
followed by the SM 52 while the least overall
pleasing results was that of the Oce'. Second
lowekt was the CLC system.

+

The three best visually assessed systems
(Indigo, SM 52 and Xeikon), were also the
best in matching the proof, with the same
sequence.

assessment, and acceptability, came out as
the 3rd best in the ranking.
Indigo was again the best, followed by Doc
70, whlle the Dl was the lowest followed by
the SM 52, although the later was the second
best ~n both the rank~ng and acceptab~llty
assessments.
Figure 13 showed that colour is not the
only factor or criteria in deciding which print or
system is the best, there are many other
factors, such as resolution, gloss and
sharpness, which play a significant role in this
decisiod.
The offset litho inks were less closer in
matching the proof eventhough the proof was
prepared from the films made to be used in
offset litho printing. Gloss played a significant
part in some of the observers' decisions while
others were looking mainly at grey balance,
colour casts, tone reproduction and real
natural colours.

CONCLUSION
Despite the fact that these systems
differed from one another in the qual~tyof
their output, each of them can be the best in
satisfying certain needs at certain market
sectors. It is also expected that durlng the
