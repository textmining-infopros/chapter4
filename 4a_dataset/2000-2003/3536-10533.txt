Web Page Designing: An Introduction
Alka Bansal & Pushpa Raina

Abstract
This article is meant for anyone who views a web page and would like to get
introduced to the subject of web page designing. It introduces the. subject of web
page designing. Steps for developing a web page, website hosting, security policy are
described in brief. A brief description of HTML tags used for designing a web page
is also given.
1. INTRODUCTION
The type of information on the Internet is as diverse as the people interested in it. People
exchange e-mail, participate in discussion groups (known as news groups), socialize (one forum
for such activities being called 'chat'), retrieve data files, access all sorts of information in a wide
variety of formats, and get engaged in e-commerce.
The question arises that where does all this information come from? The answer is 'everywhere'because not only can anyone access information on the net, but also publish it. In one sense,
Internet can be thought as a vast and growing online library in which anyone can publish
anything he wants. .Files on the Internet too need an address for accessing. A file's address is
formally known as its Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
Let us take an example of a URL say http://www.ala.org/events/ev_home.html. An address of a
website is commonly enclosed with an arcane list of symbols beginning with the letters 'http://.'
Here, 'http' stands for hypertext transfer protocol. It is the content identifier (content-id in short).
The content-id tells the browser which protocol or language was used to create the current page.
The browsers may support other protocols, such as ftp://, gopher://, telnet:/ / , etc. The second
part of the same address i.e., www.ala.org/events/ev_home.html identifies the location of the
particular web page or resource.
To understand the location better, it can be divided into two smaller parts the first part is the
domain name or host name. Each computer connected to the Internet has a unique name that
makes it easy to identify it from the thousands of other computers connected directly to the web.
A PC may not have a domain name but the service provider does because it is connected to the
web. (One connect to the web through One's service provider's domain). So the address
www.ala.org refers to the web managing portions (WWW) of a computer called ala.org. The org
part tells that this computer is basically used for organisation purposes. Other popular extensions
include '.com', '.edu' or '.gov', etc., indicating a commercial enterprise, or educational institution,
government, etc. The second part of the location is the name of a particular web resource. This
name looks very much like a directory path because that's exactly what it is. Here, in our
example, the address will connect the viewer to a document called ev_home.html, located in the
events directory of the ala computer .
To have an Internet tour, the most important piece of software one needs is called a browser, a
program that lets a user visit different sites on the net and display their offerings on the computer.

Most popular browsers are Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. One visits a site by
supplying the browser with an address or URL. The browser dowloads the document whose URL
is given on user's computer screen.
The first page appearing on any site is generally called the home page-which is the primary
document of a site giving details about the site and introduces what would follow. From a
particular web page one can access other related sites and information by clicking onto links
which are conspicuous either by a different colour or type (being underlined, etc.).
2. STEPS FOR DEVELOPING WEB PAGE
To develop a content-rich, easy to read and use web page, one has to follow the following steps:
2.1 Purpose of Web Page
For developing a web page that is easy to read and use, one needs to focus on the purpose of the
web page. One has to be very clear about goals and objectives. Maybe the web page is an
informational article, or a web page of an organisation where one has to create a menu page so
that people can access the available resources quickly. One has to have clear idea regarding who
are the target audience of the site.
2.2 Web Page Planning
Planning is a very important part of web page development. One may plan his web pages through
two ways:
Internal Planning-regarding the content included in the web page. It includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Forming the project team
What kind of information is to be presented (home page, informational article, etc.)?
How to present the information (page layout)?
Size of the page for download purpose
Does the page engage the visitor?
Should the page be static or interactive?
Will the contents be useful enough for visitors to refer again?
Information about.last updation?
Future improvements
Tracking results and responding to visitor feedback
Revising page.
External planning is regarding customer base and the Internet itself. It includes the
following:

•
•
•

Will the web page be easily navigated?
How will people visit web page?
How can we make sure that people stay to explore our site?

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15

•

How to popularize the site?

One should note down the resource sites to be incorporated into the web page. The pages offering
additional activities like quizzes, puzzles, games, slide shows, and other additional resource links
can be added to the web page to engage the visitor.
2.3 Designing
2.3.1 Components of Web Page
The components that make up a web page are:
•
•
•
•
•

Text
Pictures
Animated graphics
Audio files
Video files

It is not necessary to include all components on a page. The first priority is to make sure that
pages are fast to download easy to read and well-organized. It is not essential to include animated
icons to make a page visually interesting; some very nice pages have been created using 'only
well-thought-out text and pictures .
2.3.2 Web Authoring Languages
•
•
•
•
•
•

HTML (Hyper text Markup Language)
DHTML (Dynamic HTML)
XHTML (eXtensible HTML)
XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language)
SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language)

2.3.3 Steps for Creating Web Page
The general steps one should follow to create a web page are:
1. Use a text editor like word pad or notepad or web page editor/authoring tools like Microsoft's
Front Page, Macromedia's Dreamweaver, HoT MetaL, Hot Dog to create the pages for the site
and save them as HTML files. These web editors create HTML codes for the text. For example, if
one creates a file named 'abc' in word pad, he has to save the file as abc.html. A brief information
about use of Front Page in web page publishing is given in later part of the article.
The images can be saved in gif or jpg format. For editing of images any of these tools/programs
can be used: Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft's Image Composer, Macromedia's Fireworks, Paint
Shop Pro, etc. A clipart can be used, if graphics are not self-created. Programs like Core! Clipart,
Front Page Clipart, etc. can be used.

2. Prepare/digitize other individual components, e.g., audio/video/graphics/ani- mation files.
Sound or video equipment are needed for creating audio or video files.
•
•

For creating animation, Macromedia's Flash or Macromedia's Shockwave, etc. can be
used.
For including audio/video on web, the following formats can be used:

* Audio file format *.aiff, *.aif,*.au, *.mid, *.wav
* Video file format *.avi, *.mov, *.mpeg, *.mpg
* Streaming format: Allows media to begin playing while it's being downloaded
•

Real audio/video

* Quick time
* Microsoft's streaming
* Shockwave
•

MP3 format

3. If the page requires more advanced features, such as forms that users can fill in, or a
connection to a database of information from which informational pages can be created based on
user requests. (A form on a web page is just like a form on paper. Visitors fill out the form to
order products, give answers to a survey, or other purposes). Based on the information provided
in users' forms, the web page can run CGI scripts, which are the programs that process the
information filled in by the visitors.
4. Use a browser to view the page that have been created. Check that the text is spelled correctly,
graphics look good and that links among the pages work. Repeat these steps until the page looks
presentable enough to publish.
5. Publish the page by putting all of its files (HTML files and graphics files) on a web server.
6. Use a browser, view the web pages as stored on the web server. One should view the page by
using at least two web browsers (for example, Netscape Navigator 4.5 and Internet Explorer 5),
because different browsers format pages slightly differently.
7. Publicize the page, get feedback, get new ideas and repeat the steps.
2.3.4 Structure of Web Page
At the beginning of designing a web page, one should try to organise the information on the site
so that it is easy to find and is seen in reasonable context. The first thing one has to know is
where people are going to start from. Most sites have a home page similar to front door in a
house. Other sites are designed so that people interested in different topics come in via different

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15
© 2001, DESIDOC

pages, often from links on other pages. The simplest site has
just one HTML page.
Controlled Site: If one wants visitors to see in a fixed order
then a linear site is built with no optional path. For example,
one can have a presentation or a story or article.

Tree Structure: Here, the home page serves as table of
contents. The links on that page take the user to a number of
pages, each of which can be a content page or can have a more
detailed table of contents with its own page links. Each page
should have a link back to the one that it branches from, and
possibly a link to the home page.

Equilateral Structure: In an equilateral structure,
every page is linked to every other page, usually by
a group of links at the top or bottom (or both) of the
page. This type of structure enables quick movement
from one page to another. It eliminates the problems
regarding from which page the visitor is coming in;
no matter which page that is, he will be able to
access to the other pages. But, this type of
arrangement has some difficulties like for a site with
a large number of pages, the number of links
becomes unwieldy and to add or remove a page, one has to change all the pages.

Combining Structures: A site can be formed by combining
the above-mentioned structures in a way that makes sense for

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15
© 2001, DESIDOC

the site. The following diagram shows an equilateral set of pages on various topics, some of
which serve as the starting page for a tree structure:
Some of these pages contain links that leap to unconnected pages for ease of users. One has to
make sure that basic structure must be reasonably clear to the visitor.
2.3.5 Guidelines for Designing
The following guiding principles can be kept in mind while designing a web page:
Content
•
•
•
•

Provide useful and valuable information
Consider the high cost of following each and every link and make sure each page has
useful content on it
Create material targeted specifically at the selected audience
Add compelling content-something the visitor is not expecting.

Scope
•
•

Start small. It is better to publish a few excellent pages than a large quantity of partially
complete pages
Gradually add material to the page. Do planning for future expansion.

Links
•
•
•
•

Do not create a page that only has links
Be sure to annotate links so that visitors have a clear idea about what's going to follow
Structure the material so that visitors do not have to follow too many links to get to the
desired information
Include navigational links on every page. At least there should be a link to the home page
on every other page.

Appearance Counts
Along with the useful content, it is important for the layout to be attractive. While designing, the
following points should be kept in mind:
•

Graphics
o If the graphic is larger than a two inch square or a one by three inch rectangle, use
a thumbnail image of the picture
o Use 'thumbnails' (miniature versions of images) if there are many images on a
single page. Visitors can click on these images to see the full-sized versior
o Reduce the colour palette to the lowest possible pallette size to ensure quick
downlo~ of the web page
o Use the same graphics as often as possible. An image that is used repetitively only

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15
© 2001, DESIDOC

needs to be downloaded once. Using a large number of different images will slow
the download time of a web page. It may desist the visitors visiting the web page
again
o Break big images from in to parts for simultaneous downloads
o Don't use more than one animation per page.
Background Colour or Image
Add background colour or a background image, but do not use busy backgrounds.
Even if the text shows up clearly on the background, it can be difficult for people
to read if there is too much text or animation in the background
o Light backgrounds should have dark text and dark backgrounds should have light
text. Be careful in choosing the colours. Not all computers see the same colour
hues
o Make background width 1300-1600 pixels for those with larger screens.
o

Vary Font Colour & Size
o

Use the font size tags to vary the body text and the header tags to vary the size of
the headings and sub-headings and different colours to give good effects.

Credit to Graphic Artist
o

Read the terms artists laid while using an image from their website. Many
appreciate a link back to the website while others do not want.

Citing Text Sources
o

Citing Internet sites which have been used to gather information as resource links
will lend credibility to work. It also prevents one from misusing other people's
work.

Establish Credibility
At the end of each web page, one usually includes the following information:
o
o
o
o

The name of the author of this activity
E-mail address of the contact person for this activity
When was this web page last updated and links were checked
Name of the host or organization.

3. HTML & WEB PUBLISHING
The technology of web publishing has evolved fast from HTML to JAVA. HTML is a document
description language derived from SGML that consists of text and fixed tags, and is the original
and most widely used markup language on the web. Tags describe the attributes of the text and

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15
© 2001, DESIDOC

other content and are used by clients to determine how to display the text or perform other
manipulations. In HTML, both the tag set (the choice of tags) and their semantics (what they
mean) are fixed. A list of HTMl tags is given as Appendix to the article.
While starting to design a web page, the first thing to realize is that what one creates on the
system may not be what is seen by the visitor. The reason may be one of the following or
something else:
(a) The user may have a lower resolution screen with fewer colours and poorer graphics;
(b) The user may not be using same browser with its special extensions;
(c) The user may be using a previous version of the browser.
3.1 Designing of Components of Page
3.1.1 Page text
Headers can be made using the commands <hl>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. HTML 2.0
has relatively little control over the fonts in which the document will be displayed, although the
text can appear in bold or italics. There are other block formatting and font commands listed
below.
3.1.2 Format blocks in a variety of ways
Different browsers may handle some of these tags in the same way; i.e., they may not provide as
much of a distinction as one wishes. The essential block formatting elements are:
<ADDRESS> ...</ADDRESS>
Format an address section
<BR>
Force a line break <P> ...</P>
Specify what text constitutes a paragraph
<CENTER> ...</CENTER>
Centers the text inside it
<PRE> ...</PRE>
Use text already formatted

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15
© 2001, DESIDOC

<BLOCKQUOTE> ...</BLOCKQUOTE>
To quote text from another source
3.1.3 Make most of fonts
Fonts are a very important part of any web page. A page looks better if it has a good choice of
font sizes and styles.
* How to do it
The <FONT> tag is very powerful. With its use,. the size or colour of the font can be changed at
any time. <FONT SIZE=(+ or - size)> will increase or decrease the size of the current font. Here's
one example of making the first letter of each word in title bigger:
<H3><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>IT <FONT SIZE=+2>F</FONT>OR <FONT SIZE=+2>T</
FONT>AT</H3>
Here's what it looks like: TIT FOR TAT
The <TT> tag changes the font to Courier (.if the browser settings are not altered).
3.1.4 Backgrounds & Colours
The simplest and effective way to make a page attractive is to add to a page a nice background.
Colours are specified as a series of three hexadecimal numbers representing the share of red,
green, and blue. For monitors that display fewer colours, the colours selected would be
approximated. In the Hotdog editor, choose colours using sliding bars for the share of red, green,
and blue; it figures out the corresponding hexadecimal values. One can also change the colour of
the text and of the links, before and after they have been clicked. These commands all go in the
<BODY> tag, which comes at the beginning of the document after any header information.
* How to do it
<BODY BACKGROUND="filename">
Suppose we have made logo of an organisation and want to give it as background image. We
will save it as gif file say logo.gif. It will do the job. It's nice to also add an ending </BODY> at
the end of the file.
<BODY BGCOLOR="#RRGGBB">
allows to set the colour of the background to something specific.
<BODY TEXT="#RRGGBB">
sets the colour of all normal text within the document.
<BODY LINK="#RRGGBB" VLINK="#RRGGBB" ALINK="#RRGGBB">

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15
© 2001, DESIDOC

sets the colour of all other text in the document. LINK is just a regular, never before visited link,
VLINK is a previously viewed link, and ALINK is an active link ('The colour when clicked on
it'). Any or all of these three options can be omitted.
RR, GG, and BB are two-digit hex numbers (oo-FF) representing the amount of red, green, and
blue in a particular colour. Since it would be too difficult to have a good defined list of colour
names, hex numbers are used as well, so one can invent own colours. "#FFFFFF" represents
white and "#000000" black.
3.1.5 Creating tables
The table must start with the command <TABLE>. Each row must start with the command <tr>
(for table row) and within the row, each cell must start and end with <TD> and </TD>,
respectively. It ends with the command </TABLE>. If one uses these commands, Netscape and
other browsers that support tables will take care of the rest and have a generic table. One can add
a caption to the table by using the command <CAPTION>, the text you want, and then
</CAPTION>. If you want a header row in the table, use the <TH> and </TH> commands for the
first row.
* Tables Definitions
Define table
<TABLE></TABLE>
Table border (either on or off)
<TABLE BORDER></TABLE>
Table border (one can set the value)
<TABLE BORDER=?></TABLE>
Cell spacing
<TABLE CELLSPACING=?>
Desired width (in pixels)
<TABLE WIDTH=?>
3.1.6 Handling images
Images are an essential part of web pages as they convey a great deal of information. They can
serve as icons on which to click for moving to other places. But many users of the web have
slower speed modems. The graphic that looks great to the designer might make visitors click stop
and move to another page.
A graphic can be mixed right with the text, in which case it's called an 'in-Line' graphic, or one
can have a link to a graphic which will display by itself on the screen. Some browsers can only

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15
© 2001, DESIDOC

handle the latter.
The tag for in-Line images has the form:
<IMG SRC="filename" ALT="Description" ALIGN=top | middle | bottom >
For a visitor who cannot view graphics, designer must write a description of the graphic in the
'ALT=' field that he or she might view. ALIGN specifies if the following line of text is aligned
with the top, middle, or bottom of the graphic.
A common and exciting way to use a graphic is to make it part of internal or external link.
Suppose we have the graphic file apple.gif in. which a picture of an apple has been drawn. And
we want someone to click on this file apple.gif to go to another html file called fruit.htm where
the text describing information about apple is given. The syntax for this would be:
<A HREF="fruit.htm"><IMG SRC="apple.gif ALT="An Apple"></A>
Here we start with the A or Anchor command, put in the reference, and then instead of text we
put the graphic reference. Finally close the anchor command with </A>.
If a user clicks any web page and chooses 'View Source' from the browser menu, the
corresponding HTML code that the user's browser is following to produce the web page will be
displayed. A complete HTML document begins with <HTML> and ends with </HTML>. An
example of web page tagging using HTML is shown in Figures 1 and 2.
Java is a programming language one can use to create small miniprograms called applets that can
be embedded in web pages. Java applets can be played on any type of computer-Windows, Mac,
or UNIX.
Applets are small single-purpose applications that cannot run by themselves; one has to use a
compatible web browser (such as Netscape Navigator, or Internet Explorer) for them to work.
4. FRONTPAGE 2000
FrontPage 2000 is a popular web editing tool, developed by Microsoft for creating, publishing
and managing world wide web pages. The main features of the program are

Creating new web page quickly with templates, themes and wizards
Web Clip Art-to include cliparts
Add Drop Down Menus-they enable the user to choose from several possible options
Bringing existing sites into FrontPage 2000 without losing any of their HTML coding
Editing web pages exactly as they appear in a browser
Switching between normal editing and HTML coding
Verification of links
Turning features of FrontPage 2000 on and off depending on web browser used by page
visitors
Using FrontPage server extensions to add interactive capabilities like surveys, discussions
forums and feedback pages
Supports inclusion of forms and frames .
Connecting the site to Microsoft Access database or Microsoft Excel spreadsheets .
Integrating web with the other programs in office 2000 suite
Editing, cropping and adding transparencies to images within FrontPage instead of using
an image-editing program
It implements sophisticated web technology like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
Javascripts, and ASP (Active Server Pages).

4.1 Components of FrontPage 2000
•
•
•

FrontPage Explorer-tool to create, view and maintain the web
FrontPage Editor-HTML Editor
Image Composer-Graphics editing tool

5. MAINTAINING WEB PAGE
Once an activity is created, one needs to constantly check and revise data to keep it current and
informative. A web page will wither away if host does not revisit it often to improve its

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15
© 2001, DESIDOC

appearance, content, and organization, or to add up-to-date information to it. To avoid chaos, one
needs to establish a clear, simple system for making updates. Every site needs a Webmaster to fix
things that go wrong, respond to basic e-mail, keep the server running, and post updates and
changes.to the site as they evolve. One must remove outdated material and broken hyperlink, etc.
In short, setting up a web page is not likely to be a one time project one can just finish and forget,
it is more of an ongoing commitment
6. PUBLISHING TOOLS
Web editors are good for the laborious task of creating web documents, but they do not
necessarily help out much with the ultimate project of building a coherent site out of its
constituent pages. They might check the links as they exist now, on the computer, but it takes a
special program to help remotely control a site on the server. Such programs can update changed
pages regularly and move pages around without manually retyping all the links to those pages.
These programs are more than web editors. Since they help out with the site management they are
called web publishing programs.
Adobe PageMill: It publishes our locally created pages to the public site. It finds bad links and
corrects links when we re-arrange pages.
Microsoft FrontPage: It is like a basic web editor but has sophisticated site management and
automatic/dynamic content creation.
NetObjects Fusion: It allows to design pages in its own format which it eventually translates to
HTML when all the pieces are put together.
Netscape Composer: It has complete integration with the Netscape package, one can browse to a
page, notice an error, click the edit button, correct the error, click the publish button and post the
page back to the server, after error correction.
7. EXAMPLE
Following example may help one get started in planning a web page of a department. The content
of the page may include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Information about the department-historicalbackground, general description, including
location, message from the Director, organisational philosophy, mission, charter of duties.
Employees' description and activities-name, Qualification, place of work, photographs, email number, address, job responsibility, etc.
Projects assigned to the department.
Products developed by the department.
Achievements, awards.
Publications-house bulletin and newsletters, literary magazine, course catalogue, publicity
material.
Additional information-activities of other groups, services rendered by the library, HRD

DESIDOC Bulletin of Information Technology , Vol. 21, No. 2, March 2001, pp. 3-15

•
•
•

activities -conferences and courses conducted.
For background, the photograph of the organisation building, logo, etc., can be given.
Towards the end of the page, one should give e-mail and phone numbers for any
additional information. A line stating date of last updation of the page should also be
mentioned
To make the page more attractive, scientific puzzles, chat facility and latest news updates
can also be included.
