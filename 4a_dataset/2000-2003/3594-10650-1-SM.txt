Materials Science Research and Development in
India: A Scientometric Analysis of International
Collaborative Output
S Mohan, B M Gupta & S M Dhawan
Abstract
Materials science research in India is analysed for a period of five years
(1995-1999), based on a study of papers published by Indian scientists in
collaboration with foreign researchers, as covered in Material Science Citation
Index (MSCI). The results indicate that materials science in India is broad based
and covers most of the important sub-areas, and is based on inherent strength.
Most of the work involved bilateral rather than multilateral collaboration. The top
collaborating countries were the US, Germany, France, UK and Japan.
Collaborative linkages with developing countries accounted for only about 10% of
the total papers. Ten top Indian institutions contributed nearly 50% of the
collaborated papers. The major areas of collaboration were theoretical studies,
metals & alloys, electronic materials and super conducting materials.

1. RELEVANCE OF MATERIAL
SCIENCE RESEARCH
The materials revolution, together with
information technology and biotechnology is
considered to be the major driving force of a
new industrial paradigm. It is characterised by
two decisive breaks with past practice: (i)
greater input of knowledge in the materials
industry, as opposed to inputs of raw
materials and energy, and (ii) creation of
specific properties for materials according to
need. Advances in areas, such as the
theoretical understanding of physical and
biological matter, experimental techniques,
and processing technology have now enabled
us to have materials designed to meet
specific demands, and these are called the
‘new’ or ‘advanced’ materials. Examples of
these can be found in the new ceramics,
composites, polymers, etc. But there are
other approaches as well. Pre-existing
materials might be adapted or changed to
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23(2)

meet differing requirements (e.g. alloys).
Materials might be investigated and found to
meet new requirements such as in energy
savings, pollution control, safe packaging,
etc. New uses might be found for abundantly
available materials or waste materials.
Traditionally used materials might be
upgraded to perform their functions better.
These advances might enable us to increase
human welfare without increasing energy and
materials input while controlling pollution.
Materials science research has thus
become one of the major driving forces for
change in the modern era, and in order to
maintain or create global competitiveness, all
countries are interested in investing in R&D in
this new area, with the hope of creating new
industrial opportunities. India has also started
major research programmes in the material
science area, involving a large number of
universities and research agencies.

2. THRUST AREAS IN MATERIALS
SCIENCE RESEARCH
The thrust areas of materials science
research follow from the possibility of
designing new materials based on our
understanding of the structure of matter.
Here, our limitations are basically in thinking
of new applications and seeing whether
specific structures can be designed for
meeting these requirements. A second
approach is to strive for understanding of new
physical
phenomena
such
as
superconductivity; applications will follow in a
serendipitous manner. A third approach is to
contribute to currently discernable trends for
reduction in use of materials and energy. All
three approaches can contribute new and
productive research in the area of materials
science.
One of the major aims of materials science
research, is to create new ‘functional
materials’. This term indicates a class of
materials, which are used in various branches
of industry because of the specific tasks that
they perform, for instance, electrical,
electronic, magnetic, optical and other
functions. Examples might be considered of
materials for integrated circuit electronics,
superconductors, optical fibers, integrated
optical circuits, photovoltaics, piezoelectrical
and other electromechanical materials,
thermo-electric materials, memory metals
(i.e., those that when deformed can be
restored to the original shape by heating),
sensing devices materials, conducting
ceramics, magnetic materials and so on. All
these materials, perform specific functions,
and new and advanced industries come into
being as a result of their use. All of them need
a good theoretical understanding of atomic
and molecular processes and can thus be
termed knowledge intensive. Also there are
new materials, which are designed, modified
and changed as a result of understanding of
the underlying processes. Thus polymer
composites, advanced alloys, metals and
metal matrix composites, materials specially
designed to be thermally stable, corrosion
resistant, etc. come into the picture. The
tendency for most modern materials is to
12

become knowledge intensive, i.e., use in
lesser qualities and with greater sophistication
in processing to yield improved materials. The
improvement is defined in terms of useful
properties such as high strength, wear,
corrosion and chemical resistance, and a
number of new functions such as magnetic,
conductive and photonic properties.
Developments
in
manufacturing
technology, and superior technical properties
offered by the new materials often make it
possible to use mineral resources much more
economically. For example, in metallurgy,
near net-shape casting and powder
metallurgy
can
reduce
machining
requirements by more than 50% and
materials by about 30%. The integration of
the information industry with manufacturing
offers further scope for materials saving. The
use of CAD/CAM, adaptive robot systems and
computer modeling of functions will help to
reduce over-design and give just adequate
strength where needed. Such advances in
manufacturing methods and processes
constitute a second major area of research.
A third thrust area emerges from the study
of possible substitutions of one material with
another in order to achieve some given target.
The scope for such substitution is quite great.
Generally the motives are saving of a scarce
and therefore costly resource, or weight
reduction and increased strength with
consequent energy savings in use of a
particular equipment or component. Other
goals may be prevention of corrosion,
environmental compatibility, and specific
properties such as fracture resistance, ease
of processing, ability to function in some
specific environment, etc. It is seldom that the
absolute unavailability of a resource prompts
a substitution. A more common need is to
reduce costs.

3. R&D IN MATERIALS SCIENCE IN

edge in R&D in materials science, in terms of
number
of
institutions,

the area of materials science. Many of them
are in high technology areas, which are
currently considered important internationally.
In addition, there are many universities where
materials science research is carried out.
Private industry also contributes its own share
of research, especially in specific areas, such
as rubber products, synthetic textiles and
cement. Most of the funding for research in
India comes from the various government
agencies, such as the Department of Science
and Technology (DST), Defence Research &
Development
Organisation
(DRDO),
Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Council
of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), All
India Council of Technical Education (AICTE),
University Grants Commission (UGC), etc.
Under the DST, Scientific & Engineering
Research Council (SERC) has promoted
major research programmes in frontline
materials areas with inputs from industrial,
research
and
academic
institutions.
Representative areas include smart materials,
nanoprocessing, advanced ceramics and
composites, surface engineering, powder
metallurgy, computer controlled fabrication
techniques, etc. The CSIR has also
contributed
substantially
to
materials
development in different areas, such as
photovoltaic materials, high performance
composites & ceramics, carbon fibers,
advanced polymers, super conducting and
magnetic materials and so on. The DRDO is
14

also a major player in the field, as are the
Department of Space and the DAE in their
respective areas. A significant effort has been
the development of the Light Combat Aircraft
(LCA),
a
multi-role
combat
aircraft
incorporating state of the art technology
especially in the areas of lightweight high
1
strength alloys and composites . Table 2 lists
the number of projects and the amount of
investments made by different research
agencies in materials science funded through
extra-mural programmes from 1996-97 to
1998-99. There is also significant investment
in this area in various research laboratories
and university departments, which is not
shown here. Thus, while there may be a need
for some reorientation of research, India lacks
neither the resources nor trained manpower
for a significant programme of research into
the development of materials for various
purposes.
In accordance with a general policy of
creating a wide spectrum competence, India
carries out materials science research in a
wide variety of fields. A previous study of
published literature found Indian research in
materials science to be broad based and
carried out in a number of governmental and
non-governmental research institutions and
universities2. According to the study, polymers
were the most prolific area of research, with
32.43 % of published papers, followed by
metals and alloys (26.35%), glass (8.05%)

and composite materials (5.43%). In 1996,
the Technology, Information, Forecasting and
Assessment Council (TIFAC), which is set up
under DST came up with a list of priority
areas of research in advanced materials3. The
major priority areas were considered to be:

Significant research efforts are going on in
all these areas. In addition, efforts are being
made in other application areas, such as
strategic industries with a bearing on defence,
space or nuclear related fields, advanced
sensors, cryogenics, robotics, artificial
intelligence systems, and new manufacturing
techniques such as powder metallurgy. An
advanced center for powder metallurgy has
also been set up. However, production
capabilities in advanced materials areas are
yet to be realized.

4. IMPORTANCE OF
COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH
Despite its efforts at self-reliance, India
has understood the benefits of cooperation
with other developed and developing
countries in scientific research. International
cooperation strengthens national capability by
gaining access to latest developments,
modernising infrastructure, enhancing skills
and promoting the capability of generating
new products and processes 1. Its greatest
benefit could, however, be in benchmarking,
knowing where we stand in a specific field in
comparison with others. It can also be a
means of promoting joint ventures, and for
sharing of capabilities. To take only one
example, India’s success in the software field
would not have been possible without
extensive prior academic and industrial
contacts. Advanced countries also benefit by
the collaboration, since in many areas,
observation of phenomena and control of
variables in a large number of experiments is
essential to eventual success and the
relatively less expensive brainpower in the
developing countries can make a critical
contribution. In many developing countries,
and especially in India, good science
co-exists with outmoded industry, and
collaboration may be one means of
recognising and eventually bridging the
critical gaps.
Cooperation in S&T areas is effected
through a number of means including
exchange of scientists and technical
personnel, joint research and development
projects, exchange of information at various
levels, through organising joint seminars, and
so on. Training of scientists and technicians
and technical assistance programmes are
also important. The collaboration could be
bilateral, regional or multilateral, and initiated
at the government levels or through individual
academic contacts. Bilateral programs for
India exist now with around 45 countries. The
most prominent collaborations are, of course,
with the advanced countries, such as US, UK,
Japan, France, etc. But, a number of
programmes with developing countries and
regional groupings like SAARC also exist.
16

Collaboration at individual level, through
academic linkages, is very important in the
case of the US. In case of Russia, which has
made a very significant contribution to
defence
related
materials
science,
collaboration is mainly at government levels,
through joint programmes and training
programmes, although much of it is not
accessible through published literature.

5. OBJECTIVES
This paper aims to identify the major
areas, sectors and institutions involved in
Indian materials science research that have
collaborative linkages with developed and
developing
countries.
The
areas
of
collaborative research are compared with
national needs and also priority areas
identified by TIFAC. This will help us to
understand to what extent the collaborative
research is helping to meet our national
objectives, conforms to the general
international trends, as well as to learn about
new technological developments taking place
in this area.

6.DATABASE AND METHODOLOGY
Publication data for the study was derived
from the CD-ROM version of the Materials
Science Citation Index (MSCI), brought out by
Institute of Scientific Information (ISI),
Philadelphia, USA for a period of five years,
i.e., from 1995 to 1999. The database covers
around 2000 significant world journals in all
fields of S&T, focussing on materials science
research. The journals covered by MSCI
represent mainstream science. The study was
restricted to co-authored articles, arising out
of India’s collaborative research with all major
developed and developing countries. The
number of such papers was 2587 for the
period 1995-1999. Each paper was analysed
under two broad subject classification
categories, developed at NISTADS and given
in Tables 3 and 4. In this classification, the
first classification category identifies the
research paper in terms of a particular
material, group of materials or work area. The
second classification category identifies the
nature of work that was being done on or for
a specific item in category 1, such as analysis
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23 (2)

& characterization, metallurgical operations,
corrosion studies, etc. Together, the two
classification categories would specify the
kind of research taking place in a specific
area, and would uniquely identify the research
reported in a particular paper. In the
classification used, there are 36 items in
Subject Category 1 and 14 items in Subject
Category 2.

7. RESULTS
In all, 2587 research papers were
published in materials science by Indian
scientists in collaboration with scientists from
62 developed and developing countries
during 1995-1999. Materials science research
is considered as an important area among
national priorities and involves participation
from a very large number of Indian institutions
representing various sectors, agencies and
areas. The research output of these

7.1 Priority Areas of Research
Among the 36 subject classification areas,
the major focus of collaborative research was
as follows. General organic materials
(synthesis as well as characterisation), a field
which is more linked to general chemistry,
produced the maximum output of 285 papers,
followed by general metals & alloys (238
papers), electronic/ionic materials (235
papers), super conducting materials (230
papers), magnetic materials (208 papers),
general polymers (140 papers), and
optical/photonic materials (125 papers). The
theoretical study of materials & structures
also formed an important category (123
papers). Other identified areas of research
were composite materials, with emphasis on
metal-matrix composites, carbon fibers and
carbon-carbon
composites,
polymer
composites, and nanophase structures.
Research into properties of liquids, gels,
foams, etc., which are expected to be
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23 (2)

important in newly emerging clean technology
processes, is also significant. Polymeric
membranes and fullerenes, which have great
potential in new technologies, are yet to take
off significantly in India. Certain areas of
industrial importance, such as building
materials, energy related materials, ores &
minerals, etc., are under-represented in the
Indian collaborative research, presumably
because most of the work in this area is being
done without international collaboration.
However, some newly emerging areas, such
as organometallics, shape memory alloys,
and thermoelectric materials are rather poorly
researched.
Perusal of the classification category 2
(functions, operations and applications)
reveals that under all types of materials
classified according to subject category 1,
analysis & characterisation forms an
important aspect of the research. Most of the
work in organic materials pertains to this type
of work (259 out of 285 papers). For other
areas,
such
as
metals
&
alloys,
electronic/ionic materials, superconductors
and magnetic materials, similar kind of work
also constituted a substantial fraction (about
33% of the papers). Theoretical analysis,
calculations of structure & properties,
observations of phenomena & explanations
also form a very significant category of work.
Predictably, metallurgical operations, heat
treatment and measurement of elasticity
related properties form a significant activity in
metals
&
alloys
category.
Similarly,
measurement of electrical & magnetic
properties is significant in super conducting
and magnetic materials. Research results
indicating the utilisation of any of the studied
materials in collaborative research for a
specific application in some process are quite
rare, indicating that materials science
research in India is not yet of much
commercial importance.

7.2

Nature of Collaboration

Out of the 2587 collaborated papers, 2237
were
bilateral
in
nature,
involving
participant(s) from India and at least one
other country. The rest (350 papers) were
multilateral
in
nature,
involving
the
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23(2)

participation of India and at least two or more
countries.
Among the bilateral collaborative papers,
the largest number (997 papers involving 30
countries) is published by Indian scientists in
collaboration with scientists from Europe,
followed by North America (705 papers
involving 2 countries), Asia (424 papers
involving 11 countries), Oceania (52 papers
involving 2 countries), Latin America (24
papers involving 5 countries), Middle East (20
papers involving 4 countries), and Africa (18
papers involving 8 countries).
Among North America countries, there are
two preferred collaborating partner USA and
Canada, with 636 and 69 papers respectively.
Among European countries, the important
collaborating partners were Germany (266
papers), France (232 papers), UK (227
papers), Italy (84 papers), Spain (30 papers),
Sweden (22 papers), The Netherlands (18
papers), Russia (16 papers), Belgium (15
papers), and Poland (15 papers). Among
Asia, the more preferred collaborating
partners were Japan (216 papers), followed
by Malaysia (88 papers), Singapore (43
papers), China (20 papers), and Bangladesh
(15 papers). Among other regions, the
preferred collaborating partners were Brazil
(17 papers), and Israel (16 papers).
Collaborative research with developing
countries formed only about 10% of the total
papers.

7.2.1 Multilateral Collaboration
Among 350 multilateral papers, the largest
collaboration of Indian scientists was with
USA scientists with 148 papers, followed by
Germany (93 papers), Japan (68 papers), UK
(59 papers), France (59 papers), Italy (48
papers), The Netherlands (19 papers), Brazil
(18 papers), Russia (18 papers), Canada (16
papers), Sweden (16 papers), China (16
papers), and Spain (15 papers).
In these countries, the scientists are
participating in a group consisting of 3 to 7
countries
per
paper.
The
scientists
participating per paper in a group of 3 and 4
countries accounted for 297 papers and 43
papers, respectively out of 350 papers,
19

forming majority of papers. Similarly, there
was a participation of institutions in a group
ranging from 3 to 8 per paper. Again, it was
observed that the group of papers having
institutional participation of 3 and 4 institutions
per paper account for 179 papers and 93
papers, respectively out of 350 papers.

7.3.2 Bilateral vs Multilateral
West Europe as a whole has nearly 50%
more collaborations than the US and Canada
taken together. Eastern Europe, including the
ex- Soviet Union countries, accounted for only
about one-tenth of the collaborations as West
Europe
or
North
America.
Bilateral
collaborations
out-number
multilateral
collaborations by a factor of 3 in West Europe
and North America, but interestingly they are
more or less equal in Europe and Latin
A merica.

7.3

Areas of Priority with Specific
Collaborating Partners

The specific distribution of collaborative
papers under the different subject areas in
any particular country could be due to a
number of factors: (i) a specific requirement
from the Indian side, reflecting the priorities in
Indian research, (ii) a reflection of the
research priorities in the collaborative country,
(iii) indicative of the attitudes in the
collaborating country, that they may permit
collaboration only in general academic or
pre-commercialisation areas, and (iv) a mere
utilization by Indian researchers of whatever
collaborating opportunities existed. Which of
these either single or in combination,
contributes most to the observed pattern
needs to be investigated.
In 784 papers resulting from Indo-US
collaboration, superconductivity (80 papers)
and metals & alloys (79 papers) were the
areas of maximum choice, followed by
magnetic materials (65), electronic materials
(64) and polymers (51). Analysing the
functional categories, we see that the largest
segment of the collaborated papers in the
area of superconductors was in the
theoretical area, calculations of structure &
properties or explanations of observed
20

phenomena (35 papers). Analysis and
characterisation of prepared samples comes
next with 27 papers, followed by property
measurements (9 papers) and chemical
manipulation of the material (6 papers). For
metals & alloys, magnetic materials and
electronic materials, the largest segment was
analysis and characterization, followed by
theoretical calculations and explanations, and
then property measurements and synthesis.
In 359 papers resulting from Indo-German
collaboration, the priority areas were metals &
alloys (51 papers), followed by electronic
materials (40), magnetic materials (31), and
super-conducting
materials
(22),
and
polymers (20). Characterisation and analysis,
and theoretical studies were again the two
largest categories, but there was greater
emphasis
on
synthesis
&
chemical
manipulation of the material as compared with
the case of the Indo-US collaborations.
In 291 papers from India-France
collaboration, the significant collaborative
areas were super conductivity (43 papers),
followed by magnetic materials (41),
electronic materials (23) and polymers (21),
but optical materials (20), and thin films (15)
were also significant. Here, though the two
areas of analysis and theoretical studies
formed the largest two categories, there was
a greater emphasis proportionately on
property measurements and synthesis than in
the case of US and Germany.
In 286 papers resulting from Indo-UK
collaboration, major emphasis was on super
conductivity (43 papers) and magnetic
materials (35 papers) followed by electronic
materials (26 papers), metals & alloys (17
papers), optical materials (12 papers), and
thin films (11 papers), but there was also a
greater emphasis on purely theoretical
structures (31 papers), than in the case of the
other significant collaborating countries.
In
284
papers
from
India-Japan
collaboration
the
main
areas
were
superconductivity (45 papers), electronic
materials (45 papers), metals & alloys (27
papers), magnetic materials (24 papers),
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23 (2)

optical materials (18 papers), and thin films
(17 papers). The category of general organic
materials chemistry had less emphasis in the
case of Japan. Photonics and thin films
research, both of which are of great industrial
importance in the coming future, was
proportionately greater in the case of Japan
than in case of other collaborating countries.
A surprisingly large fraction of the
collaborated papers with Malaysia (95 out of
98) were in the area of general organic
chemistry. This might reflect a tie-up of
specific universities or academic institutions in
India and Malaysia for research in this
particular area.
Collaborations with all these countries also
include substantial activity in general organic
materials as well as theoretical studies. In
general, the bilateral collaborated papers give
greater emphasis on theory and sample
characterisation than other areas.

7.4

Contributions of Major
Collaborating Institutions

A total of 154 Indian institutions, including
universities
and
national
laboratories
participated in collaborative research. The
major collaborating institutions with their
output, number of collaborating countries, and
major areas of their collaboration are given in
Table 6. Of these, 5 institutions contributed
more than 100 collaborative papers each,
while 85 contributed in the range of 1-5
papers. The first 10 institutions accounted for
about 50% of the collaborative papers (1304
out of 2587 papers). The Indian Institute of
Science, Bangalore had contributed 286
papers, the largest number among all
participating Indian collaborating institutions,
followed by the Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research, Bombay (191 papers) and the
Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (149
papers).
Comparing with Table 1, we can see that
some of the most important research
institutions in material science do not figure
highly in the list of collaborating institutions,
since their work is more based on self-reliant
efforts. This indicates that material science
research in India is built on a solid foundation
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23(2)

of national research capability. Collaboration
with different countries has played only
supplementary role.

CONCLUSION
Materials science research has taken off in
India in recent years, but the research is still
confined to academic level. Application
oriented research is minimal. Substantial
activity takes place within the theoretical area.
The preferred areas of collaboration with
major countries were superconductivity,
metals & alloys, and electronic and magnetic
materials. The collaboration appears to be
driven more by academic interest and
opportunities rather than by any consideration
of national priorities for India.
Comparing the collaborated papers with
the thrust areas identified by TIFAC, one
could see a broad concurrence, but not by
any means a one to one correspondence.
The areas identified by TIFAC for research
actually presuppose a higher tech scenario
for India than is warranted by the actual
industrial status of the country. It is basically
driven by the wish to catch up with the
advanced technological sectors. Research in
India also, being done more in universities
and research establishments rather than by
industries, follows the same trends. Thus, one
could see that while the most important
current area from the industry standpoint,
namely metals and alloys, does top the list of
collaborated papers, it is closely followed by
electronic and superconducting materials
which are as yet rather speculative areas
from the Indian industry status.
Areas such as polymer, ceramic and metal
matrix composites need to be strengthened
much further since they are capable of
contributing to industrial production much
more
than
other
areas
such
as
superconducting materials. Certain areas
such as nuclear materials will not be reflected
in the collaborative research output since the
efforts in this area would be almost entirely
within the country, due to strategic
considerations.
