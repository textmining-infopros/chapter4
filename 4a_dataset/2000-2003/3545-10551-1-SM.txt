Resource Description Framework (RDF) for Organised
Searching on Internet

Abstract
This article focuses on the search performance of the existing searCh engines on
internet. Discusses few so\utions for the current searching problems, and suggesrs
the resource description framework (RDF) for organised searching. The paper dm
indudes the usefulness of RDF schema and covers the futuristic vision of RDF.

1. fNTRODUCTlON
The existing World Wide Web (WWW) has
become a platform where one finds information
of his/her interest ranging from household to
serious scientific literature. But finding
information on Web is a matter of tuck, often it
i s like "one puts a hand i n the heap of garbage
to find a gold coin". One solution to this lies
with searching through subject specific
information ports or subject gateways. But the
question is how to find such ports to take off.

1.1

Understanding the Problem (An
Analogy With Real World)

Suppose MCY is fo be found out in a group
of people. One way of doing is going lo
everybody and mark the checked ones. Is it a
feasible idea? On internet, something like this is
the situation with search engines where they
produce a huge bunch of uniform resource
locators (URLs). it is desired for surfer to go
through the long list of URLs. During searching
process, checked URLs turn into different
co\our and user has to spend enormous time in
searching for relevant information on the
internet.

1.2

Solution in Real World

If we take some parameters to categorise
people based on, age, sex, height, etc.,
DFSlDoC BuCtin d l n l Technol,2001,21(4&5)

obviously i t becomes easy to find Mr Y. Now
the question arises, can we do the same
process on web also?
Generating subject specific ports is one of
the approaches to tackle this problem. But such
ports are soon lost and again it is difficult to
find such ports, as these ports wil\ also become
the part of internet and get mixed with
innumerable other web documents. Definitely
interdisciplinary subjects are a big matter of
concern in retrieval.

2. METADATA: IT IS LIBRARIANS'

TIME
Librarians are practising use of metadata
since the very inception of library. One of its
form can be seen in the subject categorisation
and description of documents in a catalogue
entry. The description of a document i s done in
terms of it's title, author, place, publisher, call
number, etc. It seems very easy in traditional
form but the question often asked as how to
implement it on the internet? Who is the
cataloguer? Where to keep such a catalogue?,
and is i t a feasible solution?
There are thoughts about the problem and
different solutions are suggested. A set of 55
elements of Dublin Core (DC)' are defined,
MARC tags are extended for web documents,
usage of metatags are suggested in HTML. But
3

the problem remains same as how to make
search engines understand that a user is asking
for a particular document, and even whether
the tag set suggested by DC or MARC is
sufficient for document description. Even as the
standards mentioned above are being widely
discussed and pushed, then why did MathML
(Mathematical markup language)' and CML
(Chemical markup language)' came into
existence?

rating mechanism about the contents of web
pages. The idea was to filter the unwanted set
of web pages, which contain foul language,
pornographic material, violence, etc. When the
project was initiated it was found that it can be
used for describing the content of web page.
Later on it was made to represent content
understandable by machines. The extension of
PlCS project was PlCS next generation
(PICSNG), which was later called as resource
description framework. The idea was to use
semantic nets to describe the web resources.'

3. WHAT NEXT?
Generation of new subject specific markup
language highlights two aspects of the failure of
DC and MARC. Firstly, the non-implementation
of existing schemas like DC and MARC or
non-standardisation
of
webdocument
description. Consequently, most of the user
communities
are
oblivious
to
these
developments. Secondly, subject specific user
community may not be very happy with
existing schemas like DC or MARC b e c a w
these schemas cannot define com~letelvthe
specific' information conveyed within the
document with few limited tags or in other
words it highlights the inefficiency of these
schemas to map a specific subject.

5. MODELLING DATA IN RDF
Representation of data through RDF is very
easy as it follows semantic nets. A simple RDF
model has three parts.
(a) Resource: Any entity which has to be
described is known as resource which is
equivalent to subject in normal English
grammar. It can be a 'web page' on internet
or a 'person' in a society.
(b) Property: Any characteristic of resource or its
attribute which is used for the description of
the same is known as property, which is
equivalent to predicate in normal English
grammar. For example, a web page can be
recognised by 'Title' or a man can be
recognised by his 'Name'. 'So both are
attributes for recognition of resource 'web
page' and 'person' respectively.

a Uniform resource identifier (URI). It can be a

resource is uniquely identified.

location of definition of elements of schema.
This can be done using a particular statement
within the RDF document.

A property itself can be a 'resource', which
makes a complex representation model of the
data. For example, say Creator of the web page
http://drtc.isibang.ac.in is 'Suchitra' who is
project assistant at DRTC and has an email
suchi@isibang.ac.in as represented in Fig. 2.

There, the RDF document uses 'dc' as
'ndmespace' for the definitions and is available
at the URt http://purl.org/dc/elernents/l.0/
where definition of DC elements is given. So,
RDF document is supposed to read definitions
from the DC website.

There may be more than one Creator of
the webpage of DRTC. An even more complex
system
can be generated using other
metatag, schemas. Fig. 3 gives the pictorial

representation
of
(http://drtc.isibang.ac.in).

In XML, a 'namespace' is represented in the
tag as follows:

6. SYNTAXFORRDF
Basically RDF follows a container package
model. A container can have many packages or
a package itself can be a container.'
RDF follows syntax. The major problem
with XML is that anyone can create a set of tags
which is a hindrance for the structural
standardisation and generation of sema,~tics of
a web document. To have standardisation
concept of metadata,
RDF is a sort of
harmonisation of various metadata schemas, in
other words it acts as a platform for eff~cient
search and retrieval of web documents.

6.1

Haimonisation: Through
Namespace

RDF uses 'namespace'
concept for
identification of
metadata schemas. A
'namespace' is a standard identifier which
suffixes a tag to point out to which schema the
tag belongs. To use the metadata schema
within a document it is must to provide the

xmlns:dc=http://purI.org/dc/elements/l

.O/

<dc:creator~Suchitra</dc:creator~
The above staiement means that 'Suchitra' is
the creator of mentioned document and the tag
<creator> is a Dublin core element. Therefore,
in a document one can define as many
'namespaces' as required and use them. But the
whole document will be enclosed in '3 RDF tag,
and inside a <rdf:Description> which represents
that the document is a RDF document.
For example, a full-fledged RDF entry wilh

can be rendered as:

RDF has already defined few tags for the
document description. One of the tags is
Description',
which
is
represented as
<:Description>, and shows that the packages
inside the <rdf:Description> is the description of
the document. XML provides the facility of
defining attributes. So <rdf:Description> has an
attribute about which says that this RDF
document
is
a
description
of
'http://drtc.isibang.ac.in'.

7. IMPORTANCE OF UDF FOR

FUTURE OF WEB
Currently the web is a mixture of noise and
useful information. It is often difficult to extract
the relevant information out of it. The model of
RDF has been created keeping a broad idea
about the future of the web.
(a) There is no semantic value in current search
engines. One of the objectives of RDF is to
make machines understand the semantics of
the data within a web document. That means
tomorrow if one searches for the term
'computer drivers' the search engine will not
retrieve information as, 'taxi drivers', 'truck
drivers' or 'screwdrivers'.
(b) Tomorrow's web will be having a wide range
of applications. One can 'switch on' the
home microwave machine from his/her
office. The appliance will have intelligent
agents which will function according to the
program for which they are programmed. For
example, if the washing machine could not
identify a particular material of cloth, the
agent will collect the data from the server of
the manufacturer and find the type of
washing the clothe requires. All these
functions will be done by the agents which
will work behind the scene. It is also true that
all house appliances wit1 also have the IP
address and not only that, they will have all
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2001,21(4&5)

the data which will distinguish them from rest
of the world and this will be done using
metadata and in RDF format. Perhaps, this is
a far-reaching scenario.

8. HOW LIBRARIES ARE BENEFITED
Spread of internet has made almost a sort of
compulsion for the libraries to put their
collection on the web or on local intranet.
Definitely RDF provides librarians a unique way
to describe their collection and library both.
Since RDF uses XML encoding, it can be
very beneficial for the data interchange among
the libraries and extraction of data can be done
from databases and promises standardisation
for data interchange.

It is true that internet is the biggest find of
the century, but its unmanageable growth has
played havoc in retrieval. Particularly to those
who are in the profession of information
storage, retrieval and dissemination it poses a
big problem. It is equally true that this growth
has made many libraries and information
centres to go online but the danger is always

Contributor:

there that a useful collection may get mixed
with unwanted collection and thus discovery of
information becomes the primary issue. RDF is
a format which can be used for efficient search
and retrieval. It has been initiated out of the
PlCS project and just 2-3 years old, it means still
it has a long way to go. Already tools are
available on the web which can be used to
write RDF documents without much hassle.
