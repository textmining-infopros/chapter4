Marketing—A Critical Policy for Today's
Information Centre
S. Ganguly & Debal C. Kar
Abstract
The challenge of coping with the changes in social, technological, economical
environment has forced the library and information centres (LICs) to change their
time honoured old practices. Pressure for accountability and the emergence of
enterprise culture has led the library and information professionals to take
aggressive actions for financial self-sufficiency. Hence in the present era, the
library and information managers (LIMs) will have to think of producing an
information product and project it in the market for potential users which will help
to generate revenue. TERI-LIC contributes in different products and services
which are generated in-house. These wide range of products and services are
marketed and disseminated to the end users through an effective marketing
strategy and also in coordination with separate marketing service area. Most of
these products and services are price- based for the self-sustenance of the
centre.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the last decade significant changes
have taken place all over the world, and they
have been posing challenges to various
professions and professionals. It has brought
about a sea change in the library and
information profession.
The conditions of libraries and other
resource centres in our country are not very
impressive. This is due to an acute financial
crisis, budget cuts in establishments and its
subsequent
impact
on
libraries
and
information centre. It is necessary to convince
users, that information has a price label and
to produce, retrieve, disseminate, the
appropriate information and its packaging and
repackaging also incurs cost implication. In
Indian context, one has to keep in mind the
budgetary costs, increased prices for
collection, storage (in terms of space) and
dissemination of information, which altogether
compel to charge nominal fees for information
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(3)

services. Keeping in view the financial
constraints, it is necessary that some of the
cost has to be shared by the users. Many
library and information services struggle hard
to satisfy users within the limits, imposed by a
small budget. In some libraries, no input has
been given to infrastructure development,
which has declined the quality of service. For
survival, self esteem, and self-sufficiency, it is
necessary to create a niche in the society, the
libraries need to concentrate more towards
marketing of library products and services. A
well-planned marketing strategy can only
solve this problem.
Library and information centres have been
already in problems arising out of rising prices
and shrinking budgets. The fresh burden of
generating funds has further complicated their
plight. There are several sources of fund
generation which libraries can tap. These
include:
(a) Library membership fee
15

(b) Charges to library users
(c) Library services and in
computer-based services
(d) Consultancy services
(e) Other services, and
(f) Training and education.

t What in for ma tion re sources are cur rently in

particular

These can be further categorised into
computer-based and non-computer based
sources
Library & information centre (LIC) of Tata
Energy Research Institute (TERI) collects
different types of information from various
primary and secondary sources; both in raw
as well as processed form. This information is
meant for the end users, so it is repackaged
and disseminated to the user's community
effectively and efficiently. It is preferred that
the information collected from different
sources are demand driven.
TERI has a vast collection of energy,
environment, biotechnology, and sustainable
development
related
information.
This
information is collected from far and wide for
the use of in-house research professionals.
TERI-LIC not only serves the in-house users
but also caters to external users. The goal of
the LIC professionals to render high quality
products and services to users at the right
time and at the right place, in the right format
has always been an integral part of the
professional ethos. Therefore, the information
professionals have tried to bring efficiency of
techniques to control and retrieve information
for user's satisfaction with the application of
latest technologies.

2. SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND
INFORMATION CENTRES
Evans1 said that normally, in the special
library or information centre environment, the
focus is on small groups and individuals.
Corporation,
research
institutions,
professional organisations, and the like
seldom have a sound knowledge of the basic
issues related to acquisition and use of
information within themselves, unless there
are regular information assessments or
audits. Some of the key issues are:
16

use?
t How are these re sources used?
t What are the out comes, if any, of their use?
t What equipment is re quired to use the

in for ma tion, and who uses that in for ma tion?
t What is the cost of the information and its

associated equip ment?
t What is the ‘value’ of the re sults?
t What is the cost/benefit of infor ma tion
ac qui si tion and use within the or gani sa tion?
Based on the above mentioned issues,
TERI-LIC periodically do rigorous exercise of
information assessment study, evaluation of
activities to keep abreast with the quality of
information.

2.1 TERI-LIC: A SPECIALISED
CENTRE
The TERI-LIC has emerged as a
pioneering research library and information
source, and its collection includes over 20000
books, reports and conference proceedings in
the field of energy, plant biotechnology,
forestry, natural resources, environment and
sustainable development; around 670 current
journal titles (including over 12000 back
volumes); and a large volume of
miscellaneous
literature,
including
government
documents,
standards,
pamphlets, reprints, press clippings and
annual reports of ministries, companies,
research organisations, voluntary agencies,
and multilateral organisations. The centre
provides comprehensive information services
through its collection and by exploiting
state-of-the-art IT.
The centre not only supports TERI's
programmes but also serves energy and
environment professionals and institutions
globally, providing effective, expeditious, and
value-added information services. Apart from
conventional services, the centre's resource
include a wide ranging CD-ROM collection of
bibliographic and statistical resources and
internet connectivity for accessing worldwide
scientific information and databases. The
centre also provides a daily online bulletin
including newspaper headlines pertaining to
energy,
environment,
biotechnology,
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22 (3)

economy, transport, trade, regulatory issues,
etc., and a calendar of events.
The centre has initiated efforts to establish
an electronic library. Electronic information is
collected from online and off-line sources,
including the internet, and is organised to
build the electronic library collection. In
1999/2000, the centre also initiated steps to
build an electronic archive of in-house
research material as knowledge repository.
A repository of literature on energy,
particularly renewable energy sources,
environment, biotechnology and sustainable
development issues, the centre has been
catering to the varied needs for information
and by building bibliographic databases and
by publishing secondary journals in the
aforesaid areas. Besides data collection and
information analyses, it provides support
services to students, researchers, faculty of
educational institutions, consultants, policyand decision makers, and other end users in
the form of query-based services; prepares
up to date and exhaustive bibliographies on
various subjects in response to specific
requests; prepares the subject index for the
Institute's
publications;
conducts
computerised literature searches; imparts
training to in-house researchers; and serves
as a reference and referral centre.

3. INFORMATION TRANSFER
CYCLE
The primary purpose of libraries and
information centres is to assist in the transfer
of
information
and
development
of
knowledge. Information transfer is an
elaboration of the basic information cycle.
First is the identification stage. Then there is a
need to select the most appropriate
information to acquire. After acquisition, the
organisation organises the information in
some manner. Upon completion of the
organising action comes the preparation of
the information storage, which should mean
the information can be easily retrieved. Users
often need assistance to describe their needs
in a manner that leads to locating and
retrieving
the
desired
information
(interpretation). Finally users draw upon the
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(3)

desired information to aid them in their
activities/work (utilisation), and disseminate
the outcome of the work to the internal or
external environment, or both. If the transfer
process is to function properly, there must be
procedures, policies and people in place to
carry out the necessary operational steps. As
always, there must be co-ordination and
money for the operations what they set up to
do; this is the administrative and managerial
aspect of information work.

4. CHALLENGES FOR
INFORMATION MANAGERS
The challenge of coping with the changes
in
social,
technological,
economical
environment has forced the LICs to change
their old practices. Pressure for accountability
and the emergence of enterprise culture has
led the library and information professionals
to take aggressive actions for financial
self-sufficiency. Hence in the present era, the
Library and Information Managers (LIMs) will
have to think of producing an information
product which is useful for revenue
generation.
Availability of right information for the right
user at right time and at right cost has
become most vital. This scenario has posed
major challenges to the information sector
whose prime function is to satisfy the complex
and increasing demands for information
products and services. LIMs need to
understand that just having information and
storing it will serve no purpose, unless it is put
to an effective use by those who need it. LIMs
will have to bring the users and the
information together. However, increasing
technological advancements is still putting
more and more pressure on dynamic
managers. First, the technology in information
17

work is vastly expanding the scope of their
work. It is now possible to gain access to and
process more information than it was possible
only five years ago. Information networks
have broken time and space barriers. User
expectations are constantly changing and
increasing, and hence creating a demand
driven approach, for more sophisticated, high
quality information products and services.
Information is becoming increasingly
expensive and so is its packaging and
repackaging.
Value
addition
to
the
information, makes it more expensive.

5. CONCEPT OF MARKETING

(c) Fulfilment of the same through designing
and delivering appropriate products and / or
services more effectively.

5.1 Marketing Mix
The marketing mix consists of 4Ps which
can be expanded to 6Ps.
(a)

The product is the heart of the system. It
may be associated with the materials (books,
non-books materials, software etc.) access
channels (reference assistance, computer
searches etc.) and programmes (instructions,
demonstrations films etc).

Brown2 in his paper, mentioned that
marketing activities are a prominent part of
life today. Many people work in marketing
jobs or holding positions with marketing
departments. Most people think of marketing
solely as advertising or selling. In reality,
marketing is much more than selling the
product or services. It is one to one
interaction and an exchange of value in which
both parties ‘gain something’.

(b)

Information professionals may not realise
that they themselves are already engaged in
some marketing activities every day.
Information professionals have to recognize
that creating and following a marketing plan is
an invaluable tool; they should learn how to
harness its power to benefit the corporate
library and the enterprise as a whole.

(c)

According to Theodore Levitt 3, the
difference between selling and marketing is
that ‘selling focuses on the needs of the
buyer’. Levitt goes on to say that marketing is
concerned with ‘satisfying the needs of the
customers by means of the product and the
whole cluster of things associated with
creating, delivering and finally consuming it’.
To
market
effectively,
information
professionals must know their organisation's
business thoroughly to be able to contribute
to its success.
Marketing aims at:
(a) Identification of the client base
(b) Determination of the needs, wants and
satisfaction levels, and
18

Product

Price
Pricing of information services and
products relatively a new concept. It has not
considered seriously since library services
were being provided “free”. But, with the
increased emphasis on accountability and self
sufficiency in relation to resources it has
become necessary to cost the various
activities and to recover costs as much as
possible.
Place
This component of the marketing mix is
the channel that links product and consumer.
When
considering
the
distribution
possibilities, it is important to remember that
the product is removed not only in space from
the location of the consumer, but also may be
removed in time from when the consumer
wishes to use it.

(d)

Promotion

It involves mechanisms by which the
target groups are informed about the
resources available, services and products
offered by the library and information centre.
Libraries and information centres have
traditionally worked to satisfy the needs of
their customers. But today more than ever,
information professionals must be concerned
with marketing their services within the
organisation in order to thrive. More
alternative sources of information exist than
ever before. Although that can mean
information
centres
face
increasing
competition, it also presents an opportunity
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22 (3)

for corporate libraries to help users choose
the right source among the growing number
of services.
TERI-IDS
(Information
Dissemination
Services) area play a vital role in marketing
the finished and processed information
products to the end users. The role has been
discussed later in this regard.

6. ECONOMICS OF INFORMATION
According to Glazer 4, information as a
commodity differs from the typical goods as:
(a) It is not easily divisible or appropriable (i.e.
either I have it or you have it);
(b) It is not inherently scarce (although it is
often perishable); and
(c) It may not exhibit decreasing returns to
use, but often in fact increases in value the
more it is used;
(d) Unlike other commodities which are
nonrenewable and with few exceptions
depletable, information is self -regenerative
of feeds on itself so that the identification of
new piece of knowledge immediately
creates both the demand and conditions of
production of subsequent pieces.
Mason5 provided a starting point for
understanding what is meant by the
‘economic value of information’. He identified
three key elements:
t Ef fi ciency: where information helps the

us ers to do the job faster, more ac cu rately,
and at lower cost (i.e., how to do the job
‘right’)
t Effectiveness: where in for ma tion helps the

per for mance of a task that could not be done
be fore (i.e., how to do the ‘right’ job)
t Responsiveness : where in for ma tion helps
to re spond to customer’s de mands for
s e r v i c e ir re spec tive of ef fi ciency o r
effectiveness.
Because of the unique features of
information as a commodity, attempts to value
information using traditional approaches have
proven to be problematic. Typically, the notion
of value has two components:
(a) Value-in-use: means the benefits of
commodity to the user
(b) Exchange value: means the market place.
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(3)

Consider value paradoxes in economicsfor example, the fact that water is cheap
whereas diamonds are expensive, even
though water is vital to life, whereas
diamonds are not necessary in day-to-day
life. The solution to the paradox is the concept
of supply and demand. Water is cheap where
it is not scarce; where it is scarce, the market
value of water increases. The divergence
between the two types of value is often
extreme in the case of information. Although
information may be obvious value-in-use, it
may be difficult to establish its exchange
value,
because
information
is
not
appropriable or scarce in the typical way. The
challenge has been to create high value for
information.
However, although scarce information may
have value, one of the unique and salient
characteristics of information as a commodity
is that it is inherently not scarce and that its
value-in-use-often increases with use.

7. NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Needs assessment activities are a regular
part of the special library’s programme to a
greater degree than in other types of libraries.
Selective dissemination of information (SDI) is
a technique often used in special libraries. By
developing and maintaining user interest
profiles, the library can continually monitor the
information needs and interests of its service
population, allowing more effective collection
building. The technique also serves as a
public relations activity. Every SDI notification
serves a reminder of the library’s existence
and value. Usually, SDI services are
ineffective for large service populations,
because the services are too costly to
operate; however, several commercial firms
offer SDI like services. The Institute for
Scientific Information (ISI) is one commercial
organisation that offers SDI like services; it
also publishes several indexing and
abstracting tools to which many special
libraries subscribe (e.g., Science Citation
Index printed or online).
Libraries consider the following questions
when they assess the needs of users:
t What in for ma tion us ers need?
19

t What they have ac cess to?
t What in for ma tion they can use ef fec tively?
t How they will pro cure the in for ma tion?
t When they will need the in for ma tion?
t Who wants the in for ma tion?
t Where they need the in for ma tion?

8. INEFFICIENT USE OF
INFORMATION

except in few cases. But the centre has to
incur this expenditure on continual basis.
Therefore, for the self-sustain ability of the
LICs and to meet the geometric increase in
cost structure, they have to produce and sell
value-added products to the customers.

9.2 Cost of Producing Information

Inefficient use of information wastes
money. Many examples of inefficiency can be
found including:

In order to provide correct and timely
information, LIC has to invest and regularly
spend money for hardware, software,
manpower, documents, etc., to keep the
information input base up to date.

store and re trieve in for ma tion
Collection of the same ba sic in for ma tion by

Duplication in storage of the same basic
information.

9. WHY INFORMATION PRODUCTS
& SERVICES ARE AT A COST?
9.1

LIC Earnings

The information gathered by the LICs for
the user community's benefits, comes with a
price tag. No information is available free,

There is a greater demand of information
and financial resources of LICs for
development of information products and
services.

10. INFORMATION ACCUMULATOR
VERSUS INFORMATION USER
Why a information seeker or user (project
expert) needs information? Because, he has
got an assignment to work on. Now the
assignment, which he is going to accomplish,
is for a price. Now there are two options,
either the information seeker has ready-made
information available with him and he passes
it to the end user or he approaches the
information accumulator (LIC professional) for
repackaging as shown in figure 2.
For
example, suppose the information user
receives a project assignment from an end
user for a price, which is a compiled

information on ULSD (Ultra Low Sulphur
Diesel). The information accumulator is now
engaged to gather and repackage information
on ULSD, here the manpower cost is
involved. The information on ULSD is
collected from various sources such as from
internet, literature search of journals, online
database access, etc. All these information
sources carry a price tag, the information
accumulator also charges for his services.
Once the information is compiled on ULSD,
the information accumulator pass the
repackaged information to the information
seeker and gets his share, who further
passes it to the end user for the assignment
cost.

This should include visit or talks of or
demonstration to potential end users
communities, preparation of attractive well
presented brochures describing objectives,
services, etc., of the LICs, publication of
information articles about LICs services and
products in various journals.

11.2 Promotion of Services

11. MARKETING ACTIVITIES OF LIC
FOR REVENUE GENERATION
Professional marketing approaches will
help in achieving maximum utilisation of
information products and services and thus
generate more and more revenue. For this
purpose, library and information managers
have to take initiative and a lot of freedom has
to be given by the management to them in
their pursuit in this thrust area.
In order to generate suitable revenue, it is
suggested that the LICs put a marketing
programme which includes the following
group of activities:

The LICs should develop information that
can be given to potential end users and make
them aware of the same.

11.5 SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses,
Opportunities and Threats)
Analysis
Before devising any marketing strategies,
the LICs should do a detail SWOT analysis of
their products and services. This will not only
help the LICs to market the products easily
and confidently, but also explore the
possibility of market segments and create
niche for themselves. Table 1 shows SWOT
analysis for a small corporate library6.
