Online Patent Searching Techniques: An Overview
Qutbuddin Siddiquee & P Bhattacharya
Abstract
During the year 2000, European Patent Office (Espacenet), United States Patent
& Trademarks Office (USPTO), and Japanese Patent Office (JPO) began offering
online patent search capabilities on their websites free of charge. Some other
websites of organisations like World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO
[PCT]), SIPO (Chinese), KIPO (Korean), orgainisations from Australia, and New
Zealand also provide free search facility. This has resulted in patent information
being readily available to people than ever before due to the revolution in
information technology (IT). Researchers, who never previously considered using
patent data to supplement the basic literature, might be surprised at the wealth of
under utilized information now available at no cost. Free patent databases on the
Internet are useful, particularly as they allow users in numerous locations to
quickly access information. To search these sites searchers should be aware of
the search techniques of boolean operations, truncation, and wildcards. What
skills are required for online searching? This paper tries to provide online search
techniques to the people who want to do a patent search on the internet free of
cost.

1. INTRODUCTION
The advent of internet has made changes
in almost every body's life. It is useful for all
types of people - professionals, scientists,
researchers,
scholars,
industrialists,
businessmen, teachers, and students.

service. These sites make one to think that
one can get an adequate search cheaply and
quickly, and that no legal opinion is needed in
interpreting the results.

The area of patent has undergone a
number of changes because of the internet.
Some aspects of patents have become
simpler, such as finding patent information,
and some have become more difficult, such
as the whole issue of business patent.

Most IT professionals know the advantage
of using the internet for hosting databases.
These include swift potential updating and
amendment of files, and swift searches
through huge amounts of data. Searching can
be portable now due to internet rather than
dedicated to particular machines or in patent
offices or libraries.

The changes in the website to provides
free searches made every user able to do
free and payable search cheap on the web.
However, the main concern raised was the
quality. Many predicted that quality would
suffer as the number of free search sites
increase. Everyone is concerned about the
fact that there are many new, cheap internet
based search sites that are providing a bad

After the existence of internet, online
searching provides many advantages to the
searcher over manual searching which is
listed below:
n Speedy searching and high quality search
n Attractive functions, such as selective
dissemination of information (SDI), PDF
(Portable
Document
Format)
and
document delivery.

n Multiple searches
n User friendly interface, friendly helpdesk,

an easy to use system
n Provide patent information directly to the
end-user through web based technologies
n Inexpensive service and cost.

2. OBJECTIVES
The main objective of this paper is to
provide awareness about the techniques of
patent searching and the listing of freely
available patent databases on the websites
with their types of searches for the patent
professionals and information professionals
who are indulged in patent searching
manually and wasting their time and also to
those who are changing their searching
platform from manual platform to internet or
online.

3. SOME TERMINOLOGIES OF IPR
Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) allows
every citizen of the country to own their
creativity and invention in the same way that
they can own physical property. IPR generally
grant monopoly over the creation using
intellectual labour. IPR laws include
prosecution or securing protection litigation
and rendering of advice. The owner of IPR
can control and be rewarded for his creation,
and this encourage further innovation and
creativity to the benefit of all.
1. Patents
Patents are grants of property rights by the
government to an inventor, which prevents
others from making, using, or selling an
invention for the term of the patent.
2. Copyrights and related rights
Copyright is concerned with protecting
work of the human intellect. These include:
literary and artistic material, writing,
sculptures, technology based work, music,
films and recordings and broadcast, including
software and multimedia. Related rights are
rights that in certain respect resemble
copyright. The purpose of related right is to
protect the legal interests of certain persons
and legal entities who contribute to making
works available to the public. Traditionally,
4

related rights have been granted to three
categories of beneficiaries: performers,
producers and broadcasters
3. Trademark
Today trademarks (often abbreviates as
TM in English) are in commercial usage and
most people could distinguish between the
trademarks for the two soft drinks PEPSI
COLA and COCA COLA. For brand identity of
goods and services allowing distinctions to be
made between different traders, trademarks
are used.
4. Industrial designs
An industrial design is that aspect of a
useful article which is either functional or
aesthetically pleasing such as surface
decoration, pattern or ornament. It may
consist of three-dimensional features such as
the shape or surface of the article, or
two-dimensional features such as patterns,
lines or colour.
5. Trade secretes
Trade secretes is information that the
owner chose not to divulge at all. Formula;
business methods and blueprints are some
types of information which some businesses
choose to keep as trade secretes. An
example of trade secrete is the formula of
COKE.
6. Lay out of designs of integrated circuits
Layout-design is synonymous With
'Topography'
and
means
the
three-dimensional
disposition,
however
expressed, of the elements, at least one of
which is an active element, and of some or all
of the interconnections of an integrated
circuit, or such as three-dimensional
disposition prepared for an integrated circuit
intended for manufacture."
Integrated circuit means a product, in its
final form, or an intermediate form, in which
the elements, at least one of which is an
active element and some or all of the
interconnections are integrally formed in
and/or on a piece of material, and which is
intended to perform an electronic function.
7. Protection of undisclosed information and
trade secrets
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23 (4)

Undisclosed
information
is
such
information which must be secret, i.e., not
generally known or readily accessible to
‘persons within the circles that normally deal
with the kinds of information in question.’
Also, the information must have commercial
value because it is secret and the information
must be the subject of reasonable steps by its
owners to keep it secret.
8. Geographical indication
A geographical indication (GI) is basically
a notice strategy that a given product
originates in a given geographical area. GI's
can be protected nationally either by decree
or by a register.

4. PATENT SEARCH
We can search patents for the wealth of
technical information they contain. They often
contain valuable information, which is not
available in either journal articles or
conference
papers.
Researchers
who
overlook the patent literature run a serious
risk that they will miss important documents
and waste time and money by duplicating
previously conducted search. To overcome
this duplicating problem, researcher conduct
the novelty search.
Online patent search is not an easy task. A
searcher should be a subject expert and
should have knowledge of advanced search
techniques. An online searching charges
depend on the time duration. For a subject
expert the searching of patents relating to
his/her subject becomes easy as well as
cheap in monetary terms. Also it is necessary
to compile a list of search methods and
databases, which will help the searcher for
online searching. An online searcher may
always ask requester to give the answers of
the following questions whenever the
searcher gets a search request.
1. What information already exists on the
search subject?
2. Why do you want this information?
3. How do you hope to use the information?
4. What are you trying to achieve? For
example, to replicate an existing process;
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23(4)

to research new product; to monitor patents
in specific industry, and so on.
Here are some instructions, which make
search organised, quicker and easier:
n Prepare for online searches with the right
n
n
n

n
n

hardware, software, and computer skills
Access online patent searching resources
Narrow online patent searches with
keywords and boolean logic
Perform database searches at Patent
websites which are providing free search
facility
Search International Patent Offices
Do advanced searches at patent websites
like USPTO (American), EPO, JPO
(Japanese), IP Australia (Australian),
IPONZ (New Zealand), WIPO (PCT),
Delphion, CIPO (Canadian), KIPA (Korean)
and SIPO (Chinese), etc.

Always remember: "To do a good search
you should get a good search," so, before
going to patent search, every online searcher
must prepare the strategy of patent
searching. Step-by-step patent searching
strategies is mentioned in the flow diagram
given below:

Background Search for Patent Search
Strategy
A background survey/research of the
innovation is conducted to ascertain its
classification, expertise identification of the
operating principle, any previous work done in
this area, and its virginity. This study also
helps in reducing some technical problem, if
any, for commercial exploitation.
Simultaneously, through a search strategy,
a patent search is conducted to further check
for the novelty. There are three types of
patent search methods:
n Landscape Search
m General search on particular topic
m Latest research progress in a particular
area
n Patentability Search
m Novelty, non-obviousness, inventive
step
m Cover patent and research articles
n Freedom to Practice
m Only patents
m Searching for infringement of any patent
Process for novelty search
n Collect the background information on the
search request
n Ask requester about his research details
n Ask requester his/her definition of a
relevant reference
n Get a list of all possible keywords
n End use of the search results
This helps to design a search strategy for
more relevant and comprehensive search

then enter into that database
n Search the search strategy (SEARCH
Keywords)
n Display (DISPLAY L# ALL 1-20)
Go through abstracts of some references
and refine search strategy, if needed.
To develop the search strategy we use the
background information and try to get a list of
all possible keywords by asking the requester
for his/her definition of relevant references.
We also browse through handbooks/websites
to increase our understanding of the
keywords. Thereafter, we select a particular
online host/website and run a search with the
help of index commands specific to the
database. Generally, boolean operators,
proximity operators and wild cards are used
during the search process. To refine our
search, if needed, we go through abstracts of
some references and refine our search
strategy.

4.1 Techniques for online
searching
(a) Boolean Logic
Internet is a vast computer database. As
such, its contents must be searched
according to rules of computer database
searching. Much database searching is based
on the principles of boolean logic. Boolean
logic refers to the logical relationship among
search terms, and is named for British
mathematician George Boole. Boolean logic
allows the use of AND, OR and NOT (see
figure 2 (a, b, c)) to search for items
containing both terms, either term, or a term
only if not accompanied by another term.
(b) Wildcards and Truncation
This involves substituting symbols for
certain letters of a word so that the search
websites will retrieve items with any letter in
that spot in the word. The syntax may allow a
symbol in the middle of a word (wildcard) or
only at the end of the word (truncation). This
makes it easier to search for related word
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23 (4)

word. In order to successfully search for a
term like "Turbine Blade" it is important that
the search website allow syntax for phrase
searching. Otherwise, instead of getting
documents about turbine blades one could be
getting documents about the words "turbine"
and "blade" both appear but have nothing to
do with a turbine blade.
(d) Field Searching

EDDY OR CURRENT

Figure 2(a):Boolean search for OR operator

All database records are divided into
fields. Almost all patent CD-ROMs or online
database
products
and
the
more
sophisticated patent search sites allow users
to search for items appearing in a particular
field. This can help immensely when you are
looking for a very specific item. Say that you
are looking for a particular title ‘Electronic
Anti-theft device’ of patent in USPTO. We can
do search in USPTO (www.uspto.gov),
searching for “Electronic" AND "Anti-theft" in
title field.

groups, like ‘Woman’ and ‘Women’ by using a
wildcard such as ‘Wom*n’. Truncation can be
useful to search for a group of words like
‘invest,
investor,
investors,
investing,
investment, investments’ by submitting
‘invest*’ rather than typing in all those terms
separated by OR's. The only problem is that
‘invest*’ will also retrieve ‘investigate,
investigated,
investigator,
investigation,
investigating.’

FORCASTING AND
ASSESSMENT COUNCIL
Technology Information, Forcasting and
Assessment Council (TIFAC), an autonomous
organization under Department of Science &
Technology, Government of India, is working
in the field of Technology information,
Forecasting for the last one decade. It has a
Patent Facilitating Cell (PFC), which is very
active in patent related activities in India, also
publishing a newsletter (Intellectual Property
Rights Bulletin), advisory Services, Case
studies.
Database on Indian patents are now
available with Patent Facilitating Centre on
the CDROM discs. The databases relate to
patent applications filed and patent
applications accepted and notified for
opposition. The CDROMs can be run on the
Windows 95 and advanced versions. The
databases are quite user friendly and
equipped with latest search tools and logical
operations. Value addition has been done in
the databases to make the information easily
accessible. The required information for the
databases has been compiled from the
Gazette of India Part III Section 2. Ekaswa-A

CONCLUSION
Twenty years ago a preliminary search
was often conducted by looking through
abstracts in books and on microfilm. But in
the last two decades patent abstract have
been put into computer databases. More
recently the full text and images of the recent
patents have been put into computer
databases as well. The paper has explained
in detail the various techniques of the patent
searching. The important patent sites such as
USPTO, Espacenet, PCT database, PAJ
database are described comprehensively
along with their searching techniques. A query
searching on the basis of patent number is
possible which can help in locating the patent.
The paper also lists out the patent sites where
searches could be carried out without any
cost involvement (Appendix -I).
