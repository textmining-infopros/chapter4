239.50: An information Retrieval Protocol
A. Aruna
Abstract
The enormous growth of various online bibliographic databases on world wide
web O l i n t e r n e t has led the library professionals to learn the diverse data
structures and various search interfaces of these databases for effective
information retrieval. 239.50 is a protocol which reduces the burden of library
professionals by providing one search interface for multiple databases. It also
makes interlibrary loan totally electronic. This paper discusses this protocol in
detail.

1. INTRODUCTION
The development of online bibliographic
databases and the rapid growth of online
services accessible on the internet and world
wide web (WWW) has made it possible to
access lnformation in ways not possible
before. Libraries, whose primary mandate is
to provide information, shifted the emphasis
from collecting the information in hard copy to
accessing information through electronic
resources.
However, the major problem is of variation
in
software
and
hardware.
Library
professionals have to learn the specific
features of each system, i.e., command
languages, search procedures, etc. More the
electronic resources grow; more will be the
confusion on how to access the information of
so many diverse databases. Another problem
is the ability of many diverse database
structures and different application designs to
exchange information electronically.
ANSIINISO
239.50
standard was
developed to share the bibliographical
information electronically and to overcbme the
problems of database searching with many
search languages.

2. WHAT IS Z39.50?

* 230.50 is an American National Standard

for information retrieval. The official name
of the 239.50 standard is lnformation
Retrieval (239.50): Application Services
Definition and Protocol Specification,
ANSIINISO 239.50-1 995.

* 239.50

is

an

open

communication

protocol.
*It
specifies a standard way of
cammunication between two systems for
searching databases and retrieving
information.

* It is platform independent, i.e., it allows

communication between two computer
systems having different hardware and
software. In other words, it allows uniform
access to a large number of diverse and
heterogeneous information resources.

* This

protocol is session-oriented and
stateful in contrast to well-known stateless
internet protocols such as HTTP (used by
WWW) and gopher.

* It corresponds to the clientlserver model of

computing. In this model, two computers
interact in a peer-to-peer relationship

25

where each computer has specific tasks
for the function being performed.

* It allows searching of multiple databases
using a single, standard interface
* It allows 'broadcast searching', which

means user can perform the same search
simultaneously against several databases.

* Not a common command language
Not a user interface nor an application
program interface (API)

* Not a specification for building a database

4. HISTORY
The name 239.50 comes from the fact that
the
National
Information
Standards
Organisation (NISO), a standard developer
for American National Standards Institute
(ANSI), was once the 239 committee of ANSI.
NISO standards are numbered sequentially
and 239.50 is the fiftieth standard developed
by NISO.
NISO approved the original 239.50
standard in 1988 (referred to as 239.501988 or version 1). It was developed as an
application layer of the OSI (Open System
Interconnection)
communication
model.
239.50-1988 is now out-dated and
incompatible with later 239.50 versions. It
formed the basis of the wide area information
server (WAIS) protocol.
Almost at the same time, I S 0 approved for
a 'search retrieve' protocol called 'SR'. This
was almost identical to 239.50 except that it
used
abstract
syntax
notation one
(ASN.l)lbasic encoding rules (BER) as a
protocol data unit encoding and omitted a few
functions. This work was standardized in
1991 as IS0 10162110163.
In 1990, 239.50 Implementors' Group
(ZIG) was formed to develop profiles. Later it
changed its activity to develop and
recommend enhancements to the standards.
In addition, in 1990 a 239.50 Maintenance
26

Agency was also established, at the Library of
Congress. In 1991, a second version of
239.50 was prepared and put out for ballot.
This became 239.50 version 2 or
239.50-1992. It provided basic capabilities
for bibliographic searching and information
retrieval, primarily of MARC bibliographic
records. The standard is capable of building
simple and complex search queries using a
wide range of query qualifiers and search
terms. This version does not support features
currently available in some very sophisticated
systems nor can it be conveniently used for
non-bibliographic records. This version was
strongly influenced by SR and was a
compatible superset to it.
Development of 239.50 version 3 began in
late 1991. In 1995, version 3 was accepted.
Version 3 was much larger than version 2. In
version 2 very little was optional, while the
vast majority of the new functionality and
changes in version 3 were optional. An
additional reason for the bulk and complexity
of version 3 was that it included version 2.
Version 3 was designed as a superset of
version 2, which incorporated the ability to fall
back to the older version 2 specification if the
parties involved did not support version 3 for
the sake of backward compatibility with the
existing base of implementations. The major
new services developed for version 3 were
Scan and Explain. TC PIIP transport service
was also included in this version. In 1994,
IS0 decided to adopt the text of the 239.50
version 3 as an IS0 standard, instead of
amending SR. Recently it was expected as
IS0 23950.

5. 239.50 AND TCPIIP
239.50 was developed on open system
interconnection (OSI) protocol. This protocbl
consists of seven logical layers of hardware
or software (from top to bottom). These are
Application, Presentation, Session, Transport,
Network, Data link, and Physical. Each layer
communicates with the layer immediately
above it and below it. Though the OSI is a de
jure standard (developed on paper leaving the
proof for after establishment), the internet is
ruled by a de facto standard (it was proven
before its establishment as a standard)
DESIOOC Bulletin oflnf Tmhnd,2001,21(6)

TCPIIP. In order to make 239.50 suited to
internet environment, it was necessary to
move it from OSI framework to TCPIIP of
internet. TCPIIP is a five layer protocol with
its layers closely corresponding to OSI layers.
The main difference in layers is that the
Application layer of TCPIIP must perform the
same services of the Application, Present and
Session layers of OSI. Functionally, the
similar layers of OSI and TCPIIP are
equivalent, but they are not compatible. In
1992, shortly after the 239.50 version 2 was
released, a group of
implementors
established the 239.50 interoperability
testbed
(ZIT)
to
make
239.50
implementations work over the internet.
Interoperability testing of various 239.50
implementations through the ZIT made it clear
that the transport services of the internet
could be used successfully for the protocol. A
TCP port number for 239.50 is registered.

6. HOW 239.50 WORKS?

6.1 Client and Server Versus
Origin and Target
There are following two components to the
239.50 architecture:

+
+

Client--called an 'origin' in the standard,
and
Server--called a 'target' in the standard

The 239.50 origin is the search interface
software (client software), .and 239.50 target
is server software. Here one computer (origin)
submits a search request to another computer
(target), which then services the request and
returns the results. The messages sent
between client and server are called protocol
data units (PDUs). The structure of the PDU
is described in ASN.l. The BER are used to
serialize the ASN. 1 structure. Generally all
PDUs work in pairs; in most cases, the client
sends a PDU to the server, which replies with

another PDU. The PDU sent from the client is
usually a request, such as search request or
request to delete search results. Whereas,
the PDU sent from the server is usually a
response, such as details of the search or
confirmation of the deletion of search results.
239.50 is a program to program the protocol.
End user is not aware of it. User interacts with
user interface, which is a part of client
application. The client application converts
the queries accepted at interface into the form
required by 239.50 and communicates to the
server. At the server's end, database
application takes these and converts them
into an appropriate form for running against
the database. Result set is communicated
back. Fig. 1 shows the working of 239.50
protocol.

7. FACICITIES AND SERVICES
239.50 is divided into eleven basic
facilities. Each facility is divided into one or
more services as shown in fig. 2. A service
facilitates a particular type of operation
between the client and the server. out of
eleven facilities, three are core facilities and
they are Initialisation, Search and Retrieval.

7.1 Initialisation
It allows the client to negotiate a
2-association. This includes supported
239.50 features, default character set, default
language, protocol version and user
authentication.

7.2 Search
It enables a client to query databases at a
Server. The search request PDU, sent from
the client to the server, contains the user's
query, in a well-known search format. The
query may contain Boolean operators, fielded
search terms, proximity searching, weighted
search terms, truncation specification,

generalised pattern-matching, etc. The server
takes this query, carries out a search on the
database, and stores the results. It then
sends a search response PDU back to the
client, giving details of the search results. It
should be noted that the search results
themselves are not transmitted to the client.
Only the'details about the search results are
transmitted. Some servers can store the
results of many searches at any given time.
The Bib-1 attribute set is used to define
search parameters for bibliographic records.

7.3

Retrieval

This facility offers following two services:

+

Present: allows the client to request one or
more records from a specified result set.
This includes requesting 'pecific ranges of
search result~(e.g.*
records 10through20).
elements
in a
(e'g'9 titleand
author), specific variants of the record (e.g.,

+

MS-Word and HTML, or English and
French), search term highlighting, etc.
Present service is more useful to the
librarians as it defines how records can be
requested, i.e., MARC, OPAC, etc.
Segment (added in version 3): if the records
requested by a present request do not fit in a
single segment, segment breaks the large
number of records into smaller numbers.

7.4 Result-set-delete
Here, the client request the server to
delete one or more sets of results by use of
the delete request PDU. Server's delete
response PDU contains operation status.

7.5 Browse (added in version 3)
This service is called 'scan' and allows an
ordered list, e.g, alphabetical list of subject
headings or authors to be scanned or
browsed. Scan isa request to bring back a list
-

28

DESIDOC Bulletin d l n f Technol, 2001,21(6)

of headings in order from a specific start point
and allow browsing. Browsing is an important
feature when searching remote catalogues.

7.6 Sort (added in version 3)
Sort facility is a single service carried out
on the server. It allows a client to request the
server to sort a result -set (or merge multiple
result sets and then sort). This way of working
is easier, faster and more flexible.

7.7 Access-Control
This facility covers security measures. The
server as part of a specific operation or the
whole association initiates this. The
accesscontrol requestlresponse mechanism
can be used to support access-control
challenges or authentication, including
password
challenges,
public
key
cryptosystems,
and
algorithmic
authentication.

7.8 AccountingIResource Control
It has following three service:
4 Resource-Control: permits the server to

send a resource-control request, e.g.
notifying the client, that either actual or
predicted resource consumption will exceed
the agreed upon limits. A consent to
continue an operation is sought from the
client-'Can I spend some more of your
money?'
4 Trigger Resource Control: The client
triggers this service and it asks the Server
'how much money is left in the account?'
The response is a resource-control
message with a resource report.
4 Resource Report: The resource report
which is passedto the client can contain a lot
of detailed information including figures on:
Numbers of records in current set so far
+
Estimated complete set size
+
Processing time so far
Estimated cost so faifor this operation
+
Estimated cost if completed
+ Cost for the clientlserver association.

DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol. 2001,21(6)

7.9 Explain Facility (added in
version 3)
Explain facility is designed to maintain a
searchable database of all the features of a
239.50implementation on a server. The client
can interrogate this database and find out
exactly what services and their basic
characteristics are available at the server.
These include general features (description,
contact information, hours of operation,
restrictions, usage cost, etc.), databases
available for searching, indexes, attribute
sets, attribute details, schemas, record
syntaxes, element specifications, sort
capabilities and extended services supported.
It uses the services of search and retrieval.

7.1 0 Extended Services (added in
version 3)
The extended service facility is a major
enhancement to the standard's original SR
objectives. Extended service allows the client
to start-up specific 'task packages' on the
server and to control how they operate. It
provides access to the servic- , outside the
protocol. Presently, the defined features of
extended service are:
4 Database update: A client can insert,
modify, and delete database records, or
elements of a database record.
Persistent result sets,: A client can save
one or more search result lists on a server
for access and refinement later.
4 Persistent queries: A client can save one
or more favourite queries on a server for
access at later time.

+

4 Periodic queries: A client can set up a set

periodic query schedule with the server for
executing the client's query on a regula~
basis.
4 Document ordering (ILL request): A client
can request delivery of a specific document.
When extended service task package
starts, the details are kept in an extended
service database. These may be searched
(via 239.50 of course) in order to see what is
running on the server.

7.11 Termination (added in version 3)
The termination fa~ilityallows the client or
server to close down a 2-Association. The
reasons for the termination can be system
problem, cost limits, security violation, etc.
The client can also ask for a resource report
as part of the close request, i.e., how much
money have I got left in the account?

session' and for a detailed facilities diagram

details, Biblio Tech Review, October, 1998.

8. OBJECT REGISTRIES
239.50 uses registries for various types of
objects, used for interoperability with the
protocol. Theses are referred to via object
identifiers (OID). OlDs are used as
parameters in the various protocol requests
and responses that take place between Client
and server. The three major registries are
query sets, attribute sets and schemas and
record syntax.

8.1 Query Sets
A query is a string of data and associated
parameters that define the records being
sought, the database to search and so on.
The query message sent to the server is
hidden from the user with the client
reformatting normal OPAC style search
statement. The standard at present specifies
sjx query types:

(1) Type 0: designated 'private', allowing two
systems to use a pr~vatemutually agreed
upon query format.
(2) Type 1: queries are expressed by individual
search terms, each with a set of attributes.
Terms may be combinedllinked by Boolean
operators. Terms and operators are
expressed in Reverse Polish Notation
(RPN), i.e., nierarchical search expression.,
sub expressions connected by AND, OR
and AND-NOT. This is used for
bibliographic queries.

(3) Type: commands for interactive text
searching as specified by I S 0 8777.
30

(4) Type 100: Common command language
for online interactive information retrieval
as specified by ANSI 239.58.

(5) Type 101: (extension of type-1) query for
proximity searching
(6) Type 102: ranked list query
(7) Type SQL: SQL query (Cunently under
re view)

8.2 Attribute Sets and Schemas
The attributes (or access points)
associated with search queries are presented
as an attribute set. An attribute set can have
one of several values and these values
govern the manner in which a search
proceeds.
Attribute sets can be logically divided into
two types, domain specific and facility
specific4omain specific being directly
related to attributes associated with individual
communities, whilst facility specific being
essential for implementing certain 239.50
facilities.

8.2.1 Domain Specific Attributes
Following are domain specific attributes:

*
*
*
*
*
*

Bib-1 - Bibliographic
GILS Government information locator
service
STAS - Scientific and technical
DL - Digital library collections
ClMl - Museum collection information
GEO - Digital geospatial metadata, etc.

-

The most popular attribute set is Bib-1. It
was developed for the bibliographic resources
(to view different library systems for searching
and retrieving information in standard and
mutually understandable terms) but now
commonly used for a wide range d
applications.
Bib-1 comprises six groupings
attributes, or attribute types. These are:

+
+

of

Use attributes: defines the access points
for a search (title, author, subject, etc.).
Relation attributes: determines how the
search term entered by the user relates to
values stored in the database index (less
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2001,21(6)

+
+
+
+

than, greater than, equal to, phonetically
matched, etc.).
Truncation attributes: defines which part
of the value stored in an index is to be
searched (the beginning of any word in a
field, the end of any word in a field, etc.).
Completeness a t t r i b u t e s : specifies
whether a search term can be the only value
in an index.
Position attributes: specifies where in an
index field the search term should occur (at
the beginning, anywhere, etc.).
Structure attributes: specifies the form to
be searched for a wordlphraseldate, etc.

8.2.2 Facility Specific Attributes

*
*
*

Facility specific attributes are as follows:
CCL-1 - Common command language
E x p l - For use with an explain database
Ext-1 - for use with an extended service
database

8.3 Response Record Syntaxes
239.50 uses record syntax concept to
transmit the recordsldata. After the search is
completed with some search results, the next
decision is-how
a record should be
displayed. The client can ask server to send
the data in the display format of its choice. If
the server can not send the data in the
requested format, it is possible for the server
to send the record back in some other format
that it is capable of. The protocol
distinguishes two types of response records
that may occur from the server: database and
diagnostic records. Both record types may be
returned in several formats.

8.3.1 Database Records
MARC formats: 239.50 supports most of
the main MARC formats-assigning them an
'object identifier number' so that the Client
and Server can easily understand which
flavour of MARC they are dealing with. These
formats are exchanged in IS02709 format.
USMARC, UNIMARC, UKMARC, CANMARC,
etc. are various MARC formats.
OPAC
(Online Public Access
Catalogue): the OPAC syntax is designed to
DESlDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2001,21(6)

simulate a catalogue card or similar
bibliographic reference format. The OPAC
syntax includes additional fields for the
display of holdings and circulation data e.g.
date due if on loan.
SUTRS (Simple Unstructured Text
Record Syntax) (text only): designed to allow
ASCII text records to be transferred during a
239.50 session. The syntax does not have
any field structures.
GRSI (Generic Record Syntax 1): a
complex tree like structure designed to
represent a database record. Although
complex, it can be used to represent any type
of database records.
Summary: the summary record syntax is
used to present brief records 40 the user as
the first response during the search
operation. Fields include, title, author, call
number place, date.
Explain: Server lnformation syntax. This
syntax is used for querying the explain
database where information about available
services is stored; e.g. databases available,
record syntaxes supported (versions of
MARC), lists of terms available for the Browse
function, payment terms, languages, etc.
Extended: when a user starts an
extended service, the details of the 'task
package' are held in the extended services
database. These details may be queried via
239.50 and information is presented using the
extended services record syntax. lnformation
held is brief (package name, user ID,
retention time permissions, etc.).
SQL-RS: SQL record syntax supporting
SQL3 datatypes (under review)

8.3.2 Diagnostic Records

*
*
*

Error formats: bib-I, diag-1
Resource report: resource-I , resource-2
Accesscontrol: prompt-1, des-1, krb-1

9. 239.50 PROFILES
A 239.50 profile is a set of implementor
agreements, which specifies the use of
239.50 to support a particular application (e.g.
GlLS
or
WAIS),
function
(e.g.
authorltitle/subject searching), community
31

(e.g. library communi.ty, museum community,
chemists); or environment (e.g. Europe,
Canada).
239.50-1995 has many optional features
and is an open standard. It is up to the
implementers to decide upon the more
specific set of 239.50 requirements. he
group of implementers with common interests
agrees upon the set of 239.50 features to be
followed, and form a 239.50 profile.
The advantages of forming a 239.50
profile are listed below:

* Vendor can be provided with specification
to build the software product, or these
specifications can be used in selecting the
software.

* It increases the reliability of results as a

profile will define the attributes and
attribute
combinations, which
are
supported by server.

* It will

reduce the instances of varying
attribute definitions between client and
server.

* Profile will help in standardising the server

configuration i.e., the configuration will be
the same for all servers which confirm to
the profile. This will also help in
configuring client easily as server
configuration will be known which in turn
will improve interoperability and search
results.
There are many well developed profiles
and some are under'development. Some of
them are:
O GlLS profile: 'Government lnformation

Locator Service' profile is the outcome of the
need for users to identify and locate publicly
available government information
resources.
O ATS profile: The 'Author-Title-Subject'
profile aims to improve the reliability of
239.50 search results.
O WAlS profile: The 'Wide Area lnformation
Server' profile specifies rules for access to
WAlS server supporting 239.50 version 2.
It is not possible to discuss all the profiles.
A few popular profiles are listed here:

O ClMl

profile: Computer Interchange of
Museum Information profile
O DL profile: Digital Library profile
O CIP profile: Catalogue Interoperability
Protocol profile
O ZSTARTS profile: a 239.50 profile for
STARTS (Stanford Protocol for Internet
Search and Retrieval).

10.239.50 AND WWW
The point to ponder is when Web is giving
all the solutions to access information
available on internet, what is the need for
239.50. It is true that Web provides, a unified
terminal interface to navigate through and
ability to transfer files. However, for most
current library applications, the user is
typically dropped into a telnet session. A
number of bibliographic services are being
made available through common gateway
interface (CGI) interfaces. A gateway is
written to a server, and the user is offered
forms-based access. This provides access to
a particular bibliographic resource. This work
has to be repeated for each resource. 239.50
comes into picture at this point. An
http-239.50 gateway (239.50 client hosted on
a Web server, referred to as a WeblZ39.50
gateway) allows a number of resources to be
made available through the same interface,
and allows a user to access the bibliographic
resources using their familiar Web browsers.
The browser accesses 239.50 client software
on a Web server. This software presents the
searcher with HTML forms to build the query
and provides other search support
functionality. The gateway uses the
information entered in the form to create a
239.50 message that is sent to one or more
239.50 server systems selected by the user.
The server sends the 239.50 formatted
response to the client software on the
gateway.
The gateway program formats the
structured output from the bibliographic
database in HTML so that it can be returned
via the Web to be presented in a
human-readable format. By providing a user
interface, only the WeblZ39.50 gateway uses
239.50 to communicate to the remote server
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2001,21(6)

synergetic relationship between the WWW
and 239.50. The two worlds are merging
together, with each one growing stronger by
using the best elements of the otherhyperlinks between systems and document
types from the WWW--structured searching
and document discovery from 239.50". There
are a number of 239.50 interfaces on WWW
available for a variety of platforms. These
interfaces allow users to search and retrieve
directly from the Web browser (e.g. Internet
Explorer, Netscape Navigator) without the
need for new software. A short list of the
same is given at Appegdix 2. A schematic
view of 239.50 and WWW is shown in fig. 3.

and not the software on the searcher's
computer. The searcher only needs browser
software to access a gateway service in order
to query 239.50 servers. An application built
on 239.50 is smart to understand the returned
data structure. It tags it for input into a
personal bibliography; takes a record and
searches in another-database for works by
the same author; passes the record 'to a
document request service; and so on. 239.50
allows the
creation of
interworking
bibliographic applications, which share
structured data. .The final output of such a
service is delivered to the user through a Web
interface. The Web begins where the need for
smartness ends. Thus the Web is used to
provide a user interface to particular
resources or applications and 239.50 is used
for interworking bibliographic applications.

11. IMPLEMENTATION
In the International scene, most of the
library system vendors have incorporated
239.50 protocol into their products. The

software and application programming
interfaces (APls) are available in the public
domain for use by noncommercial and
commercial implementors.
A 239.50 can be implemented in libraries
in various ways. If a library wishes to make
its databases and catalogues accessible to
searching by 239.50 clients, it needs 239 50
server software Installing this system can be
complicated and expensive. Libraries that do
not have to have a Z39.50 server to be able
to search other libraries' catalogues and
databases, can go for a 239.50 client. Client
software can be installed in a few different
ways. A copy of the software can be installed
on each computer. It can be installed on a
single computer, with other computers having
access to the software via a network. Another
option is a 239.50 client hosted on a Web
server. When using the services of a gateway,
the searcher only requires a Web browser
and not a 239.50 client system to search a
239.50 server. The Library of Congress, USA
has a 239.50 gateway. It provides access to
the catalogues of many institutions, including
the University of Alberta, USA (which is listed
alphabetically under NEOS). Europgate has
links to a number of European and American
databases. The National Library of Canada's
vCuc gateway provides 239.50 access to the
catalogues of several Canadian libraries. A
list of gateways is available at :

A number of groups of libraries have
recognized the potential of 23.9.50. Projects
have been undertaken in some American
libraries to determine the feasibility of offering
239.50 services and implementing them.
Some of them are: SILO (State of Iowa
Libraries Online) project, Virtual Canadian
Union Catalogue project, Report to the CIC,
DALl (Document and Library Integration)
project, ONE (OPAC Network in Europe)
project.

12. ADVANTAGES OF 239.50

* Any database that is Z39.50-enabled may

be searched by using a single search

interface, a single set of search
commands and search strategies.

* Allows intersystem searching and record
transfer irrespective of different software
and hardware.

* Multi-database

searching using single

search interface.

Q

Virtual union catalogue--a
combined
catalogue of several libraries on diverse
systems (without merging the catalogues)
is possible. 239.50 clients will permit
searching of members' collections with a
single interface.
Interlibrary loans (ILL) process will be
made easier. Extended services for
ordering documents, updating databases
and sorting searches can be defined and
controlled via 239.50.

h Records can be displayed in any flavour of
MARC. In addition, work is going on to use
generic set of data element called Dublin
Core to use as attribute set and record
syntax.
CD-ROM databases from various vendors
could be searched with a single interface.
The time and expense of training users on
multiple interfaces could be reduced.

*

* The

SDI or selective dissemination of
information service could be set to run a
saved search in the catalogues of many
different
libraries
regularly
and
automatically with results being sent to the
user by fax or e-mail.

13. DISADVANTAGES OF 239.50

* Very complex.
* Levels of services supported within and

between the particular implementation
depend on Z-clientlz-server and host
library management system.

Q ' The

differences between the facilities on
2-client and 2-server lead to poor output.

* Multi-database searching leads to

slow
response time and information overload.

14. CONCLUSION
The 239.50 protocol not only rescues a
librarian from learning different search
interfaces for different databases, it also helps
the librarian to improve resource sharing
among libraries by virtual union catalogue and
ILL. Virtual union catalogue does not require
to be merged at one place. The catalogue is
retained distributed. The extended facility of
this protocol makes the ILL totally electronic
i.e., it allows system to arrange for delivery,
including account verification and billing, of an
item to.the enquirer. It provides 'broadcast
searching' (i.e., same search is performed
simultaneously against several databases).
239.50 also allows users to specify search
statement to be saved and run at intervals.
This greatly helps the librarian in providing the
SDI service.
Besides this, the library community has
much to offer in the way of providing structure
to information resources on the internet. The
239.50 standard is a concrete representation
of this fact.
In India, much attention has not been paid
on this. Considering the endless advantages
239.50 protocol to the library community in
specific, it is necessary that we insist for
239.50 support from software vendors and
developers and also start thinking to
implement this.
