Himalayan Information Subject Gateway in Digital
Era: A Proposal for its Development
Anil Singh & J N Gautam
Abstract
One of the major problems in accessing information from internet is that it is very
difficult and time consuming to get reliable and relevant information in the limited
time. An effective and efficient way to provide easy access to quality information
on internet is by developing subject gateways in specific areas. To meet the
information requirement of the scientific and academic community in the digital
era, various departments have developed Subject Gateways in their respective
areas and some are in developing process. This paper suggests a proposal for
developing Himalayan Information Subject Gateway for scientists and
researchers engaged in Himalayan Studies. This paper also gives an overview of
some the subject information gateways.

1. INTRODUCTION
UNESCO’s mandate ‘to promote the free
flow of ideas by word and image’, clearly
indicates that the organisation is called upon
to play in making information and knowledge
freely accessible to all, with the ultimate
objective of bridging the gap between the
information rich and the information poor. In
the IFA Programme (Information for All
Programme) of UNESCO, five areas have
been identified for digital content development
and the third area among these is
‘Strengthening institutions as gateways to
1
information’.
Gateways give an opportunity to
authors/scholars/users for providing an input
of information resource through its template,
though it is further evaluated and assessed by
gateway editors keeping in view the audience
and context/content for inclusion into the
subject gateways. The accepted resource is
then classified, indexed and catalogued. The
internet today contains huge amount of global
information. To access the required, specific,
relevant, and quality information is not an
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23(2)

easy job. The information to be accessed has
a definite purpose and theme. The theme is
usually subject oriented, therefore to have an
access to subject oriented quality information,
one must search through the subject
gateways. Subject gateways have an input of
identified, selected, evaluated and assessed
subject oriented information sources. A
quality input provides a quality output search
and it is easy for the user to decide whether
the output is matching their requirement.
These type of search facilities are created,
designed
and
maintained
by
librarians/information professionals and/or
subject experts with the aim of providing
access to high quality sources of information,
and also contain the full range of subject
oriented internet material which negate the
possibility of repetition in the search results.
The use of traditional cataloguing and
classification techniques aims to ensure
accurate subject description and facilitate the
retrieval of accurate, concise, current and
subject oriented required information sources.
Evaluated/assessed information sources also
provide a complete guide to determine the
3

scope, value, purpose, comprehensiveness,
updation, usefulness and format of the
information source accessed through the
subject gateways on the internet. 2

2. WHAT IS SUBJECT GATEWAY?
Subject gateways are online services and
sites that provide searchable and browsable
catalogues of internet based resources.
Subject gateways will typically focus on a
related set of academic subject areas.

can search by keyword or browse by subject
area. They can do this with the knowledge
that they are looking at a quality controlled
collection of resources. A description of each
resource is provided to help users assess
very quickly its origin, content and nature,
enabling them to decide if it is worth

investigating further.

4. HIMALAYAN INFORMATION
SUBJECT GATEWAY – A
PROPOSAL
The Himalayas have always remained a
source of fascination and inspiration for
people from all walks of life, and have been
deemed to be the cradle of civilisation in the
sub-continent. The variety of culture, terrain,
forests physiography, flora and fauna of this
region has lured the intelligentsia of the world
since times immemorial. However, in the
recent years, the Himalayas have become the
focus of attention of scientists and the
government and efforts are underway for a
better understanding of its highly complex
environmental and ecological systems and to
bring about an all-round development of the
region, which has remained backward
6
throughout the centuries.
In the recent years, there has been
tremendous growth of data and information
particularly in the field of Himalayan
resources. There has been a spurt in number
of research and development institutions at
the national and international level. Most of
these research institutions and universities
possess excellent libraries and information
centres, but there is lack of information
network by which co-ordination and resources
sharing could be effected for the mutual
benefit of each of these exist libraries. As a
result, it has become difficult for an
organisation to collect data and information
required by the policy makers, administrators
and research scientists. Thus, the access to
right information at right time has become
very difficult. The scientific departments of the
Government of India have already started
planning to start information network and
gateways in their respective areas. Some of
these projects are in the process of
implementation and others are in the
7
pipeline.
For the last decade, many subject based
information gateways were set up all over the
6

world. India has also been active in the
setting up of subject gateways and
considerable progress has been achieved in
this area. A number of subject information
gateways have already been set up in India.
We have already discussed some of them.
Since most of the information related to
Himalayas is scattered all over the country,
there is a need to develop a Himalayan
Information Subject Gateway. This gateway
will provide linkages to various libraries,
information centres of R&D institutions,
universities and NGOs working in the
Himalayan region. This gateway will be
developed on the pattern of SPMIGSS. The
system, therefore, has to take into account
the specific information requirement of each
development sector as far as its relevance to
Himalayas is concerned.

5. NEED OF HIMALAYAN
INFORMATION SUBJECT
GATEWAY
The Government too should appreciate
the need for integrating the components of
information infrastructure in the overall
developmental plans. Since the concept of
the ‘Himalayan Information Subject Gateway’
will have to count on the support of the
Government, the later should provide the
necessary encouragement and incentive.
A Himalayan Information Gateway is
eminently suitable for several spheres of
national activities, including planning. Reliable
and timely information for decision-making
becomes increasingly important for India,
where a concept of social welfare has been
developed over the last three decades. Many
organisations have successfully developed
their own information gateways to plan,
monitor or control their research activities,
and these have yielded increased research
proficiency. The Government should surely
benefit from these methods. Apart from
suggesting suitable solutions to the problems
in planning, monitoring, allocation, control and
coordination
of
the
departmental
programmes, one has to consider the special
distribution of these programmes.8 The need
to set up a Himalayan Information Gateway
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23 (2)

therefore, is to be considered in the context of
the rapid development of Himalayan
information as well as the increasing
awareness of their relevance to societal
development.

6. OBJECTIVES OF HIMALAYAN

9. CONCLUSION
One of the many requirements to improve
scientific research in the country is the easy
access to scientific literature. Fortunately the
information technology (IT) revolution has
brought information to our doorsteps. While
institutional and individual access to Internet
in the country is expanding rapidly, published
information is not within easy reach of most of
the scientists in universities and other
research institutions. One of the ways to
make available this published information is
by having a ‘Subject Information Gateway’ on
the internet.10
