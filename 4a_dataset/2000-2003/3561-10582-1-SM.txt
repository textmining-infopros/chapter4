A Sketch of a Code for Developing Computer-Based
Library Information Systems Based on Classified
Catalogue Code of Ranganathan (Part - II)
Madan Mohan Kashyap
Abstract
This paper proposes a code for developing library information systems or their
databases for converging the techniques belonging to the domain library and
information science and the domain of information technology for designing,
developing and implementing computer-based library information systems and
services. The paper explains briefly, various concepts relating to specifying
conceptual schema of a library database; identify and describe the attributes and
data elements of entities that are relevant or needed for creating the library
database records; and finally examines and restates some of the rules of
classified code.

1. SELECT RULES OF CCC IN
AMENDED FORM
1.1 Types and Structure of Entries
An entry has been defined by
Ranganathan as ‘a unit-record in a card
catalogue or printed list’ (cf., Ranaganathan’s
CCC. 5th ed. Chapter FN. A main entry or
book index entry of a bibliographic item of a
classified catalogue generally consist of a or
leading element or access element, such as
name of an author, call number, specific
subject statement, class number, title of a
work, etc., followed by a complete or optimum
bibliographic description about an item. We
shall call this portion of main or book index
entry as descriptive segment of the entry. The
descriptive segment of an entry contains the
primary bibliographic description of a
bibliographic item and can be considered as
basic or unit-record of a bibliographic item to
be displayed on a computer screen or online
catalogue or forming part of a main or added
entry of classified catalogue.

DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(2)

1.1.1 Definitions
Entry: An entry is a unit-record that contains
information (or data) about a bibliographic
item on a card or displayed on computer
screen. A bibliographic record displayed on a
screen, in a card catalogue or documentation
list that provides general or specific
information about a bibliographic item or
items.
Specific entry/record: Entry or record
providing information/data about a specific
bibliographic item.
General entry/record: Entry or record
providing general information/data-not related
to specific bibliographic item(s).
Consolidated
specific
entry:
Entry
mentioning two or more specific bibliographic
items.
Consolidated general entry: Entry replacing
two or more general entries.
Basic entry/record: A unit-record giving
complete or optimum primary information or
data about a bibliographic item, presented in
the form by which the item is to be uniformly
identified and cited. It forms descriptive part
3

of main entry or book index/added entries of a
bibliographic item in a card catalogue.
Main Entry: Specific entry giving complete or
optimum catalogue record of an item. All
other entries—specific or general—relating to
the item, are normally derived from the main
entry.
Book index entry: A specific added entry,
additional to the main entry, by which an item
is represented. It contains an alternative
access element under which a bibliographic
item may be searched, followed by the
complete or optimum bibliographic description
of the item.
Analytical entry: An entry for a part of or
independent contribution in an item (host
document) for which a comprehensive entry is
made referring to it locus that is, the host
document and the place of occurrence in it.
Cross reference index entry: General
added entry referring from one word or set of
words to another synonymous words or set of
words. See and See also entries.
Subject entry: Entry giving information about
subject.
Specific subject entry: Subject entry that
mentions a bibliographic item in which subject
is treated.
Class index entry: Subject entry that refers
from the name of a class to its class number.

1.2

Sources of Information for
Data Entry

The information found in the title page of
an item and its over-flow pages should be the
chief source of information for data entry in an
electronic record or an entry of a card
catalogue (excluding its leading section). It
implies that the choice, rendering and
description of various bibliographic data
elements should be the reproduction of
information exactly provided on the title-page
of bibliographic item, modified according to
prescribed rules, utilising, if necessary, any
relevant information given in the overflow of
the title page. In case of access elements, as
in the case of variant names of an author
(personal or corporate author), collaborators,
subject headings, etc., the data to be entered
and rendered according to the prescribed
rules and based on an authority list
maintained within a library system.

1.3 Organisation of Bibliographic
Description in a Main Entry or
Book Index Entries
One can refer: CCC-chapter FQ: sections
of entry and IS: 2381 - 1978. The description
about a bibliographic item in a main entry or
book index entry (specific added entry) in a
card catalogue is divided into two broad
segments:
(i) Leading segment
(ii) Descriptive segment
In addition to these segments, the feature
heading segment shall also constitute as a
component of a bibliographic list or printed
catalogue.

1.3.1 Leading Segment
Leading segment of a main or added entry
is to consist of an access element-call
number, class number, name, term, code,
etc., under which bibliographic items are
organised in a card catalogue and accessed
by users. The access element constitutes the
leading part of a main or book index entry and
is followed by the descriptive segment
containing descriptive information about a
bibliographic item.
Access elements
constitute search elements and form part of a
dictionary or inverted file of an online
catalogue or bibliographic database. For
example, call number of a monograph, or
class number of a periodical publication
constitute component of the leading section of
a main entry of the classified part of a
classified catalogue. Name of an author,
collaborator, and subject heading, etc. form
the leading section of a main entry in a
dictionary catalogue or a book index entry in a
classified catalogue.

1.3.2 Descriptive Segment
A descriptive segment of a main entry or
book index entry that contains detailed
descriptive information about a bibliographic
item and consist of the following sections
containing values of specified data elements:

(a) Access element-word entry.
8

Data items (b)-(q) are same as given in
section 3.1. Data item (r) of section 3.1 is not
to be included in this entry.

4. RULES FOR CHOICE AND
RENDERING OF ITEMS OF
INFORMATION IN AN ENTRY
We are suggesting the following changes
that may be implemented and followed in the
rules of CCC of Ranganathan for the choice
and rendering of various items of information
in an entry:
The data elements shown in Italics in the
above stated entry formats are optional in the
sense that their contents may or may not be
displayed or included in the entries of a
printed list, in an entry of card catalogue or in
a bibliographic record to be displayed on
monitor.
When the contents (or value) of a access
element has one to one correspondence with
the contents of the item of information
heading then no data may be entered in the
leading section of the book index entry to
avoid repetition of same data in both the
sections, while producing a printed list or
catalogue cards.
While bringing out a printed list, in a
classified order, the leading section may
contain feature heading in place of call
number, and the group of records falling
under a feature heading may be arranged in
alphabetical order. However, information
about the call number of a bibliographic item
may be added at the end of an entry.
Statement of responsibility part of title
section shall contain the name(s) of author(s)
in addition to Collaborators (refer CCC, chap,
FC & FD). If the title page contains the names
of three or more joint authors (both personal
author and/or corporate authors) and/or
collaborators, omit all but the first of each
group of such authors and/or collaborators
and add the term ‘and others’, to indicate the
omission.
Follow
the
Canon
of
Ascertainability, i.e., the information found in
the title page of the bibliographic item and its
over-flow pages should determine the choice
and rendering of contents of this field at input
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22 (2)

stage. However, we must generate the name
of all authors and collaborators associated
with a bibliographic item as access elements
or create added book index entries.
The names of all the personal authors,
collaborators, corporate bodies and meetings
(conferences,
congresses,
symposia,
exhibitions, etc.), responsible for or contribute
to the creation of the intellectual or artistic
contents of a work contained in the item or its
realisation, may be entered for the purpose of
generating book index entries (i.e., added
entries or searchable term), in their respective
fields, which must be defined in addition to
the heading field. The data values of the
heading field need not be extracted to built
dictionary of searchable terms for a database.
Heading field shall be treated as local field
and the names of
personal authors,
corporate
authors,
pseudonyms,
collaborators, title, subject headings (treated
as headings) may be displayed as per CCC
rules in bold letters. The names of personal
authors or collaborators may be displayed or
printed in bold letters in the form
Ranganathan, S R not in the form
RANGANATHAN (S R).
We find that the CCC allows entering the
name of two authors - personal or corporate
or collaborators in the Heading Section, or the
name of one principle author or collaborator, if
a work is authored by more than three
authors or collaborators. AACR-II allows up to
one author.This is an old practice and
perhaps followed keeping in view the
convenience of representing the information
about authors in a printed bibliographic list or
catalogue cards as well as for remembering
or recalling the name or names of authors of
a document (One can not remember names
of all authors. It is however recommended
that the names of all the personal authors
responsible for or contribute to the creation of
the intellectual or artistic contents of an
independent contribution in a bibliographic
item (i.e., article published in a serial or a
contribution in a composite monograph), or its
realisation, may be entered as heading (This
practice is followed by the scientist while

DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(2)

citing the articles, etc., in their works for
obvious reasons).
It is also desirable to enter names of
authors and collaborators (persons, corporate
bodies, meetings, etc.) in such a manner that
we can generate search terms in all possible
access forms. Very often, the names of
persons are rendered different manners by
different cataloguers. Electronic catalogue
environment enables us to generate, with
least efforts all the possible forms. The rule
and directions provide by CCC and/or
AACR-II for rendering the name of persons
belonging to different cultures, region and
locality, institutions, geographical name, etc.
may be used to provide every possible
access approach in a online catalogue. For
example:
Case I
If the names of the authors say- Manjit
Kaur, Man Mohan Singh, Ram Kumar are
rendered (or entered) in bibliographic records
by a cataloguer in the form
^aKaur^bManjit
^aKumar^bRam
^aSingh^bMan Mohan
Treating Kaur, Kumar, and Singh as entry
elements, and to print or display the names in
the form , as shown below:
Kaur, Manjit
Kumar, Ram
Singh, Man Mohan
Then we must generate additional access
points in the form:
Manjit Kaur
Ram Kumar
Man Mohan Singh
Case II
If the names of the authors say- Manjit
Kaur, Man Mohan Singh, Ram Kumar are
rendered (or entered) in bibliographic records
by a cataloguer in the form:
^aMan Mohan Singh
^aManjit Kaur
^aRam Kumar
To displayed or print them in the form, as
shown below:
9

Man Mohan Singh
Manjit Kaur
Ram Kumar
Then it is desirable that we must make
additional entries in the form:
^aKaur^bManjit
^aKumar^bRam
^aSingh^bMan Mohan
To generate additional
elements in the form:
Kaur, Manjit
Kumar, Ram
Singh, Man Mohan
Alternatively

access/search

We ignore the concept of entry element
and treat the name of a person constituting of
three parts of the name or data elements,
namely, ^aFirst part of the name, ^b Middle
part of the name, ^cLast part of the name and
enter the names of persons in the form:
^ aMan ^bMohan^c Singh
^ aManjit ^cKaur
^ aRam^cKumar
^aG.^bC.^c Chowdhury
^ aKondanda ^b Ramaiah^ cChenapati
It may be observed in the name listed
above the entry elements are:
Man Mohan Singh
Manjit Kaur
Ram Kumar
Chowdhury
Ramaiah
and as these name can be rendered in an
entry a headings, in the form:
Man Mohan Singh
Manjit Kaur
Ram Kumar
Chowdhury, G. C.
Ramaiah, Kondanda Chenapati
We can conveniently generate the
following access/search elements from this
type of input
Chowdhury, G. C.
Chenapati, Kondanda Ramaiah
G. C. Chowdhury
Kaur, Manjit
Kondanda Ramaiah Chenapati
10

Kumar, Ram
Man Mohan Singh
Manjit Kaur
Ram Kumar
Ramaiah, Kondanda Chenapati
Singh, Man Mohan
Case III
The names of the corporate bodies and
titles of serials as per CCC rule may be
entered in the form shown below:
Data Entry Format
^aUniversity
of
Delhi^6Department
of^2Library and Information Science
^aHimachal

Court^c(Dharamshala)
^aIndia^2Governor
General^cC
Rajagopalachari
^aIndia^6Ministry of ^2Labour ^3Labour
Bureau
^aMadras^1City^2Mayor^cS Satyamurty
So that the heading or the names of the
corporate bodies and title of serials are
printed or displayed as in the form shown
below:
University of Delhi, Library and Information
Science (Department of-)
Himachal
Pradesh,
District
Court
(Dharamshala)
India, Governor General © Rajagopalachari).
India, Labour (Ministry of-), Labour Bureau.
Madras (City), Mayor (S Satyamurty).
Then we must also produce additional
access points as shown below:
University of Delhi, Department of Library and
Information Science
Department of Library and Information
Science, University of Delhi
Library and Information Science (Department
of-), University of Delhi
District Court (Dharamshala), Himachal

Ministry of Labour, Labour Bureau, India
Madras (City), Mayor (S Satyamurty)
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22 (2)

Mayor (S Satyamurty), Madras (City).
It is recommended that we do away with
the practice dividing names into two parts,
namely, entry element and other name
element for rendering a name-of-person or a
name-of-corporate body at the time of
entering the data values of these attributes or
items of information in an electronic record.
The attribute ‘name-of-person’ may be
deemed to constituted of data elements - a.
first-name, b. middle-name , and c. last-name.
Similarly the attribute name-of- corporate
body may be deemed to constituted of
number of data elements, namely, a. primary
unit, level 1 (may be parent body), b. sub-unit,
level 2, c. sub-unit, level 3., and so on.
It is useful or functionally valuable to trace
the various lingual forms or other variations in
the name of a person, corporate body or
meeting, as well as the alternative names
(including pseudonym) used by a person or
other people associated with the person and
enter these to generate additional access
points (book index entries or added entries).
We find that the names of authors and
collaborators, be a personal author or
collaborator or a corporate body, are rendered
and accessed in varying forms. Cataloguing
codes also have different rules for the choice
of the entry element, and the form and order
of presentation of other name elements. It is
therefor suggested that the name of an author
or collaborator must be entered in heading
field in the form as it appears on the item. It
must also be displayed in the same form in
printed catalogue or card as heading. The
various other forms of presentations,
alternative names by which a person or
corporate body is known or referred, including
the one actually given on the title page of a
bibliographic item may be included to
generate access elements in the repeatable
fields defined for this purpose.

5. ATTRIBUTES AND DATA
ELEMENTS
We know that various type of entities
possess certain common attributes. For
example, the attribute ‘name’ is an attribute
that is commonly possessed by all entity
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(2)

classes. However, the terms used to refer to
certain common or identical attributes of entity
classes may differ, but mnemonically, they
refer to similar attributes possessed by certain
entity-types. For instance, we use the term
title in place name or provide unique code to
identify an entity-type document. The terms,
such as, ‘title’, ‘name’, ‘height’, ‘weight’,
‘price’, ‘date of birth/origin’, and so forth, all
represent the attributes commonly possessed
by various type of entities.
Keeping above factor in mind and based
on the identified attributes and data elements
of the entity classes listed in appendix 1 to
10, a general list of common fields and their
constituent sub fields will be prepared. We will
also designate the fields and sub field as
mandatory or optional, and provide them
unique codes called field tags and sub fields
identifiers. This generalised list of fields and
their codes can be used for purpose of
defining the Field Definition Table (FDT) or
database structure of library information
systems.

6. LIST OF FIELDS AND SUBFIELDS
FOR DEFINING FDT OF A
LIBRARY DATABASE
The attributes or data elements of entities
or objects about which we are interested to
collect data for use are usually defined in the
form of FDT or data dictionary of a database
system. The related attributes and data
elements of entities of interest constitute
fields and subfields of their physical records in
a database. In a FDT, for each field certain
attributes are specified, e.g., a field tag (or
address) and name (or label), sub field
identifiers and their names or labels, the type
of data or characters the field may accept,
length or size of field, etc.
An integrated database is made of records
describing different types of entities. There is
advantage in integrating the different
databases for the different types of entities
associated with an enterprise or organisation
into single database. This can be done by
listing in a single field definition table FDT all
the fields required for creating records of
different types of entities. We can shorten the
11

list by identifying the common one. For
example, The field, say ‘200: Name of the
entity’ can be commonly used to define the
field for the entry of ‘title of a bibliographic
Item’, ‘name of an employee’, ‘name of a
library member’, ‘name of a institution’, name
of library vendor, order no., and so for
creating records of entity-types - bibliographic
Item, library employee record, library
member, institution, library vendor, library
order, etc. For convenience of data entry,
separate electronic worksheets can be
prepared for each entity-type, one for creating
monograph record, another for creating serial
record, another for creating profile of
institution, and so on. The common fields will
appear in each of them.
In an integrated database, there is no
need to include information, redundantly, such
as user’s name and address in the records of
borrowed bibliographic Items on loan.
Because, these facts can always be displayed
or referred to at output stage by linking the
records of bibliographic Items with the records
of library users to whom items are loaned or
issued. However, in certain cases we may not
create distinct database or records of certain
entity-types in an integrated database. For
example, a library may decide not to create
individual records of (or distinct database) of
authors, collaborators and publishers of
bibliographic documents. In such a case
‘name of author’, name of collaborator’, and
‘name of publisher’ may be treated as an
attributes of the entity-type ‘bibliographic
document’ acquired due to its relationship
with these entity-types. However, in case of
other entity-types, such as, vendor, bill, order,
user, staff of a library system, etc., we may
create different databases and inter link the
records to get required relationship data,
wherever necessary.
A common list of fields and their subfields
(data
elements)
that
may
constitute
components of entity records, in an integrated
library database, is given below: (This list is
not comprehensive and provisional, and
needs to be further extended and moulded).

6.1 Data Fields
The fields, as defined below, are
represented in numerical order by three-digit
tag of; CCF: Common Communication

elements that form the fields are represented
by (a) to (z).

« Field 150: Heading (mandatory and

It is a data field of a bibliographic record
whose value is placed at the head of other
descriptive information of a bibliographic item
as displayed in a catalogue entry or in an
output of bibliographic record electronically.
The value of this field is not to be used to
generate search terms or added entries
(general definition). This field is to consist of

chiefly responsible for the creation of the
intellectual or artistic contents of a
bibliographic
item
or
its
realisation.
Alternatively, in some cases, it may consist of
the title of a work or bibliographic item.
The heading field is to be treated as a
local field, whose contents may vary from one
library to another, depending upon the
catalogue code or practice being followed by
a library for the choice and rendering the
headings of a bibliographic item.
Subfields:

(a) Entry element: That part of a person’s or
corporate body’s name under which
it would be entered/displayed in a
record in accordance with the
practice of an agency preparing the
record.

object /URL (uniform resource locator)
of web page.
(In case of non-bibliographic item or other
objects, a given number, label, code, term or
any other nomenclature such as bill number,
order no., letter no., chair no., table no., etc. is
to constitute component of this subfield ).
(b) Other name elements: Other parts of
the name of a person or corporate body

collaborator(s) of a work or bibliographic item
and their variant names (i.e., alternate names
or forms of names, by which an author or
collaborator has been known). The value of
each repeated field is to be used to generate
access point or search elements under which
a bibliographic record may be searched, and
to generate added entries for a card
catalogue.
Similarly, while creating record of
entity-type: library employee, library member,
record this field can be used to represent the
names of parents, children and other relations
of concerned entity. Name of a guide of a
research scholar, Originator of an invention,
manager/chief of a unit, and so forth may

associated with the entity
A corporate body, with whom an entity may
have relationship can be a government, an

While creating a record of a bibliographic
item this field is to consist of name(s) of a
corporate body or bodies responsible-for or
contributing-to the creation of the intellectual
or artistic contents of a work contained in the
bibliographic item or its realisation and
elements of specification (detail). It shall
comprise of all the names of the corporate
bodies associated with a bibliographic item,
as an author, collaborator, or sponsor, and
their variant names (i.e., alternate names or
forms of names, by which they have been
known). In addition, the value of each
repeated field is to be used to generate
access point or search element under which
record may be searched, or to generate
added entries for a card catalogue.
This field can also be used to represent
the names of corporate bodies with whom the
entity has relationship, and whose records do
not exit in the integrated database. For
example, names of associations/institutions a
person is or has been member/employee may
be represented in this field in absence of their
records in the integrated database.
This field shall be mandatory and
