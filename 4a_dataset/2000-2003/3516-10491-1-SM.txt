A Conceptual Model of Biomedical Network in DRDO
R. Chandra, D.C. Tiwari and R.K. Sharma
I

ABSTRACT
Easy and timely availability of comprehensive information catered to the
specific needs of the user is the blood of R&D activities in biomedical field. For the
successful accomplishment of the highly specialised, multidisciplinary programme,
the necessity of having an advanced IT-oriented infrastructure is indisputable. The
need to access current and relevant information transcends the boundaries of the
libraries/technical information resource centres (TIRCs). Though many
computer-assisted communication technologies are available, their provisioning
requires a substantial commitment of resources in terms of staff expertise, computer
hardware (H/W) and software (S/W) and training, which may not be adequately
available at all TIRCs. Recognising the criticality of the need to access current
biomedical information, the authors have conceptualised the establishment of an
advanced informatics centre for biotechnology under 'Microbiology 2000'
programme of the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO). The
proposed facility is planned to be established with the technical and professional
help from librarians, information technologists and subject specialists from life
sciences laboratories of DRDO. The facility is visualised as a technology group that
will perform the dual role of being the facility centre as well as the design centre. In
the second phase of the proposal, the facility may be thrown open for commercial
exploitation. Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS) can play a
pivotal role in this cooperative effort for creation of this facility, which is expected to
tremendously improve capabilities in information handling and customised services
specially in the field of telemedicine.

1. INTRODUCTION
Resource sharing has a long and noble
tradition. Recently, it has become a focus of
interest to the librarians and information
professionals. This can be seen from statements,
such as 'pride in collection has got to be
supplanted by pride in patronage', 'libraries
should think materials as comm'unity resources',
'local ownership to collective access', etcl.
Further, the terms like consortium, network, and
cooperatives have been used to label the
organisational arrangements for achieving a
variety of resource sharing objectives.
In recent times, networking has transcended
from cooperation
among libraries and
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2000,20(3)

information centres to cooperation with the
book trade2. This has stimulated e-mailing
within the context of document delivery
services. As data and information transfer is
increasingly becoming easier and common due
to the upsurge of network facilities and
capability, network users can conveniently
choose any one or more available routes to
access any document. Similarly, cooperation
among biomedical libraries and information
centres has received further boost with
advances in computer and information
telecommunica:ion
technologies3.
The
technology, . particularly
the
satellite
communication, has technically compressed
space and time. The gradual shift from analog
'3

,
to digital in contrast to analog links facilitates
the integration of 'all forms of information
communication within network environment.
These links serve to maximise access and
utilisation of materials and services of the
participating libraries and information centres in
a coordinated network environment at local,
zonal, regional, national and international Iwels.
Literature survey on library cooperation and
networking reveals that the US Library of
Congress (LC) is on the top in the list of success
records and Online Computer Library Centre
(OCLC) and other libraries and technical
information centres follow later. The UK ranks
second with the success achieved by BNB,
BLOMP, LASER, etc. In India, Calibnet, Delnet,
Bomnet, Malibnet, Adinet, Punenet, Balnet,
Mylibnet, and lnflibnet library networks are the
existing attempts in this direction4.

2. NEED FOR AUTOMATED LIBRARY
& INFORMATION SERVICE

NETWORK SYSTEMS
Advancement in science and technology has
given rise to proliferation of scientific literature
and information and the same holds good for
biomedical and allied sciences, including areas
like toxicology, food technologies, agriculture,
materials,
biomedical
devices
and
instrumentation. No library or information
centre is self-sufficient by itself. Therefore,
resource sharing among libraries is a necessity.
Cooperation
among
libraries
and
information centres is largely necessitated
because of the following reasons:

(a) Type of special services to be offered by the
network. These may include electronic mail
and CD-ROM product utilisation
(b) Capability of the network systems to
accommodate new developments
(c) Whether the facilities offered by the network
can be integrated with other information
technoiogy appliances in the library
(d) Reliability of the network services including
those of the central and zonal/regional
computer facilities
(e) Cost of membership participation versus
anticipated benefits

(f) Number and type of libraries participatingin
the network and the extent of overlapping in
the strength of their collections and services
to support record and resource sharing
(g) Security of the data,on the net and access to
only authorised persons.

3. IT REQUIREMENTS FOR

BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES &
TECHNOLOGIES IN DEFENCE
Re-emergence of infectious diseases,
availability of biological and chemical weapon!
as cheap deterrents, terrorist activities, nuclear
capabilities of hostile neighbouring countries
and the high cost of imported biotechnologia
has prompted the Defence Research and
Development Organisation (DRDO) to take,up
an integrated programme for the developmenl
of latest biotechnologies in a big way.

In response to these demands, libraries and
information centres are engaged in cooperative
ventures of all forms, such as interlibrary loan,
exchange, cooperative acquisition, processing
and storage, etcs.

To cater to the bioinformatics requiremen!
of the scientists, it is planned to share the
scarce and costly information resources. Ar
advanced bioinformatics centre is planned ta
be established at the Institute of Nuclear
Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS). The prime
objective of the proposed Biomednet is to sel
up a secure biomedical network connecting life
sciences laboratories of DRDO and decision
makers in DRDO HQrs. Also, sharing resourca
with few non-DRDO information centres 01
repute is envisaged.

Library's decision on adopting a network
and choosing appropriate type of networking
systems is a function of several parameters as
mentioned below:

DRDO is setting up a nationwide network 01
its laboratories and HQrs called DRDO's rapid
online network access (DRONA) system. This
internal corporate network is based on

(a) Continued information explosion

(b) Rising demand for information access
(c) Gradual decline in the provision of financial,
human and material resources.

integrated systems digitised network (ISDN)
services provided by the Department of
Telecommunication (DOT). AlternatiVe services
like Dialup/lNET/VSAT will be used where
ISDN services are not available.
,

Since DRONA will operate behind firewalls,
it will be possible to access the Internet while
protecting
organisation's
data
from
unauthorised non-DRDO personnel. Major
benefits of such a network include powerful
data management, ease of use, cost efficiency
and dynamic workgroup exchange6.
Network requirements of DRDO life
sciences laboratories can be summarised as
follows:
(a) Provision of resources for the biomedical
databases-this comprises bibtiographic/blC
text databases on CD-ROMs/DVDs and
, other existing online databases, besides
generationof databases of defence interests

(b) Resource sharing through databases
(c) Providing easy access to these databases

netwcrk for the
through DRDO's
laboratories located in Delhi and at distant
geographical locations, maintaining network
security
(d) Supporting all existing computer hardware
and software
(e) Implementing data archiving and disaster
recovery

(f)

Increasing the speed at which information
can be shared by users

(g) Supporting
collaboration
groupware and email.

through

Appropriate databases will be created for
answering various queries in specialised
disciplines.

3.1 Technical Features of Data to be
Transmitted
Besides data in textual form, images files
e.g, X-ray, CT, nuclear scintigrams and MR
images will be transmitted across DRDO's
biomedical network. Electronic transmission of
these radiological images from one location to
the other will be desirable for secondary
consultations. Users at different locations may

simultaneously view images. Appropriately
utlised, this tekhnque can improve access to
quality radiological interpretations and thus
significantly improve patient care. This may
allow even more timely interpretation of
radiological images and give greater access to
secondary consultations and improvement in
continuing education.
Many service providers deliver their services
using satellite technology and through public
telephone lines. ISDN is similar to the current
public telephone lines. However, ISDN is
digitally coded which allows for more varied
use. For exampld, through the public telephone
network, though the voice, facsimile and data
transmission services are available, yet these
services are limited by speed and signal
complexity.
In ISDN services,
signal
compression occurs that allows for voice, data
transmission, video, and facsimiles to operate
simultaneously. Thus, one call can replace
several calls for the same service. Besides, ISDN
lines are faster and more efficient than the
currently available public phone network.
However, in near future, we may see phone
companies upgrading their systems to allow for
the ISDN because this service can be easily
installed without phone companies having to
replace their entire system. Rather replacing all
their phone lines, all they have to do is to buy
and install new switching equipment and
interface devices that connect the customer on
a telecommunication network with video
channels having the capacity to send signals
'upstream' to a cable company or whosoever is
disseminating the programmes. Unlike the
current cable service, this system will be of the
quality of a 35 mm movie film and it can
simultaneously provide mixes of voice, text,
graphics, and moving image displays that
qualifies it as multimedia.

energy establishment came as a shock to all.
DRDO cannot afford similar act performed by
hackers guided by either a spirit of adventure or
as an attempt to steal or alter data. The form of

some precautions need to be taken and
appropriate measures have to be'devised to
secure the network against hacking, to prqvent
unauthorised use of computer and networking
system and access to vulnerable and highly
sensitive data. This will prevent serious
monetary and image losses. The security for the
network has to be reliable. The role of the user
of the network is to observe certain
netetiquette like not to communicate with
dubious people, not to open unidentified mails
with vague messages, choose less-obvious
passwords and avoid installing unauthorised
software. Strong encryption technologies,
virtual private networks and firewalls are
expected to improve the overall security of
network systems. Suggested configuration of
firewall is given in Section 4.3.3.

Firewall Configuration

Since networking
is based on ISDN
provided by DOT, it is necessary to provide a
security mechanism for checking unauthorised
accesses- Denial
of access to unauthorised
users will be achieved by access control and
authentication, which is one of the ISDN
services provided by DOT. It ensures that access
to DRDo network cannot normal'^ be made
from telecom lines other than listed.. In addition,
firewalls will be used.
DESIDOCBulletin of Inf Technol, 2000,20(3)

Firewalls are the security gateways that
protect networks connected to the Internet
from intrusion (called 'attack' in security circles)
by unauthorised parties. A firewall is the only
computer on the internal secure network that is
attached to the external non-secure network
(the Internet). The firewall acts as a proxy for
each client on the internal network, hiding its
identity and exposing only a single IP address
to the Internet.
The firewall
performs many
, other security services, such as checking IP
addresses for permission to access the internal
network and denying access to unlisted
addresses1'.

5.1 Telemedicine
Telemedicine is combining telecommunication technology with medical expertise for
the delivery of medical care and education
without regard to location. This concept will be
useful for remote medical consultations, as this
will minimise patient's travel to expensive
tertiary care, continuing medical education and
will result in delivery of quality medical care for
the benefit of 'all. Specific applications of
telemedicine include: ,

DRDO Health Centre can contribute a lot
once this facility is operationalised.

5.2 Teleradiology & Telenuclear
Medicine
Teleradiology is the electronic transmission
of radiological imaging from one location to the
other for the purpose of interpretation and/or
consultation. Teleradiology is the application of
digital technologies of telecommunication and
information management technologies for
electronic
transmission,
display
and
management of radiological images from one
location to the other. Thus, it will be an oncall
facility without onsite support to provide timely
and quality consultative and interpretative
services. There will be greater access to
secondary consultations and this will also
permit simultaneous viewing of images at
different locations thus improving patient care
and continuing education. These services will
be much in demand in view of the excellent
infrastructure in the field of nuclear medicine
and radiological imaging available at INMAS.

6. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
The Biomednet facility is proposed to be
implemented in two phases. In Phase I, after
linking the TlRCs of life sciences,. food,
agriculture, material and biomedical labs of
DRDO, a strong group of information
specialists and subject specialists will be
constituted. The Biomednet facility is visualised
as a facility centre and a design centre. Timely
information exchange on the Biomednet will be
11

initiated, followed by generation of databases
of DRD0s interest.
In Phase II, the facility will be thrown open
to chemical and pharmaceutical industry and
health services for commercial exploitation.
Faster communication channels (like VSAT links)
are planned besides improving the network
parameters and software.

7. CONCLUSION
It is true that underutilisation of the library
collection is largely due to the users not gming
the information in time. If a reader comes to
know the availability of documents required by
him, and also if he can get access to them
quickly, it would not only optimise the use oif
library collection but also would effectively
contribute to the S&T efforts in the country.
Faster and reliable communication system and
information technology has opened new vistas
for resource sharing between the generators
and users of information. Networks provide a
number of navigational tools and associated
services, which could be used by libraries to
access resources at remote places for browsing,
searching and even downloading. Networking
movement is redefining the concept of
collection,
collection
development and
transforming the selection,
preservation,
communication, and liaison functions in
libraries. A powerful new context for the theory
and practice of collection management and
requiring librarians to develop new skills, accept
new responsibilities, and change their ways of
performing various library operations is fast
emerging.
The proposed Biomednet is expected to
bring immense contribution in information
sharing in DRDO. Once fully operational, the
facility may also be open for commercial
exploitation and interaction with the academics
organisations.
