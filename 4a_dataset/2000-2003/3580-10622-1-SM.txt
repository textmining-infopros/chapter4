India’s Collaboration with Australia in Science and
Technology: A Scientometric Study of Co-Authored
Papers During 1995-1999
B.M. Gupta, S.M. Dhawan, P.R. Bose, & P.K. Mishra
Abstract
International collaborations are being viewed as an important instrument for the
advancement of science throughout the world, particularly by the developing
countries. India could well realise the significance of international collaboration in
science and hence has, therefore, signed various S&T collaboration agreements
with many developed and developing countries. With Australia also such
collaboration is starting to take off at the government level, but at the institutional
level it already exists. In this study the scientific collaboration between India and
Australia has been studied on the basis of the number of joint publications
brought out by Indian and Australian scientists, as reflected through co-authored
papers during the period 1995-1999. The study reveals the extent, mode, and
direction of collaborative research between the two nations. It also has been
attempted to crystallise and identify the priority S&T areas for collaborative
research between the two countries. The impact of such collaborative research
has been studied through the analysis of impact factor of publications where this
joint research is published. It has been revealed that the average value of impact
factor per paper for multilateral papers is far above the average impact factor of
all papers. It is also found that in about 38% of the India-Australian collaborated
papers the other countries were also involved, which included the USA, the UK,
Russia, New Zealand, France, Switzerland, and even Italy, Japan and China.
The study revealed the present status of collaboration between Australia and
India in S&T, and such a study can help the policy makers to identify and explore
the future areas of collaboration between the two countries.

1. INTRODUCTION
As members of the Commonwealth, India
and Australia have a shared history and
language, common democratic traditions,
similar legal, financial and Governmental
structures and common interest as Indian
Ocean littoral states. With the increasing
importance of the Asia-Pacific region, there
are concerted efforts on both sides to expand
and diversify bilateral relations. However,
Australian reaction to our nuclear tests in
1998 caused a setback to our relations. The

DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(6)

relations are now back in track and have
acquired a new momentum and vigour.
On economic front, India and Australia
relations are expanding rapidly. Efforts to
promote
bilateral
trade
have
been
institutionalised by the establishment of the
Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC) and the
Joint Business Council (JBC). India and
Australia have also established a Joint
Working Group on Natural Textiles Fibres
(1999) and Joint Working Group on Energy
and Minerals (1999). The Australia-Business
Council conducts a number of programs
3

designed to promote bilateral business links.
The two-way trade figure stands at $2.8 billion
(Australian dollar) in 2000-2001, which
represents an increase of more than 300 per
cent over the last decade.. However, the
trade is heavily balanced in Australia’s favour
as India accounts for 1.7% of Australia’s
exports, 0.6% of its imports and less than 1%
of Australian FDI overseas. India’s exports to
Australia have so far been in traditional areas
like spices, textiles, clothing, footwear, gems
and jewellery, chemicals and metals.
Australian companies have also been able to
demonstrate excellence and technological
proficiency in exporting a range of goods and
services,
such
as
in
the
IT,
telecommunications, financial and health
sectors,
manufactured
products.
The
Australian Government has embarked upon a
conscious strategy to assist Australian
companies trade and invest in India. Austrade
is focussing on five key industry sectors –
automotive
components,
agribusiness,
infrastructure, IT, and mining - each with its
own business program, designed to increase
awareness of Australian industry capability in
India, and introduce Indian business
opportunities to Australian companies. The
total
value
of
approved
Australian
investments in India during August 1991 to
August 2001 was A$ 2903, accounting 2.5%
of the total approved investments from all
countries. The number of Australian joint
ventures in India has grown significantly,
particularly since 1991 when the process of
economic liberalisation was instituted. The
number of joint ventures that were approved
during the period August 1991 to August 2001
was 404., of these 266 collaborations were
financial and 141 technical. Many Indian IT
companies have entered Australia, such as
NIIT, HCL, TCS, Pentasoft, Satyam, Wipro,
Infosys, Aptech, Worlwide, etc. Some other
Indian companies working in Australia are
Dastur Engineering International, Oberoi
Hotels, Asian Patents, Sterlite Industries, etc..

2. INDIAN SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNOLOGICAL
COOPERATION
International scientific collaboration is
being realized as an important instrument for
enhancing the scientific capacity of nations. It
takes a number of forms, including sharing of
research
data,
joint
experimentation,
conferencing, building of databases, standard
setting, equipment sharing, etc. The scientists
collaborate
with
their
international
counterparts for reasons that go beyond
scientific compatibility and complementarity.
Among these factors are geographical
proximity, history, common language, specific
problems and issues of common interest,
support available economic factors, expertise
and research equipment, and laboratories
facilities.
Indian international S&T cooperation
programmes may be broadly classified into
three categories, based on the mode of
funding and relative scientific and technical
strengths of collaborating partners. The first
two categories relate to whether India is a
beneficiary or benefactor. India receives
grants and some of the advanced countries
provide support to science, generally from the
local intellectual and natural resources. As a
donor, India funds R&D in other countries as
a gesture of goodwill and provides consulting
services.
In the third category, the
programmes are implemented on the sharing
1
basis .
At the official level, S&T collaboration
between India and Australia is starting to take
off. A memorandum of understanding in
science and technology between the two
nations was signed earlier during 1986 and
1975. Most of the collaborations between
India and Australia are taking place through
inter-institutional agreements at the agency
and institutional level or through informal
collaborations among scientists. For example,
Council of Scientific and Industrial Research,
New Delhi has collaboration with Australian
Department of Industry, Science and Tourism
in a few research projects of industrial
importance. Similarly, India and Australia
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22 (6)

signed an agreement for collaboration with
Australia in agricultural research and
development in February 1996. Under this
agreement,
ICAR-ACIAR
collaborative
projects were undertaken in the disciplines of
crops, soil and water management, and
animal sciences. Similarly, the Department of
Space of Government of India has an
agreement with its counterpart in2 Australia for
peaceful uses of space research .
As a part of the scientific support, the
Australian government offers few scholarships
to Indian students to study at the
postgraduate and doctoral level at Australian
universities. A large number of Indian
students go to Australia for higher and
professional studies. In 1994-95 about 370
Indian students were granted visas, but this
number crossed 12, 000 mark during 2001.
On an average 5000 to 6000 students go
3
every year . At present, nearly 10, 000
students are currently enrolled in Australian
universities and technical institutes. Australia
has a big infrastructure consisting of 39
universities and 250 technical and vocational
institutes. These institutions have close
linkages with educational institutions from
USA, UK, Canada, Europe and Asia.
Australia offers internationally recognised
education and training with a very strong
practical base.
The S&Tcollaboration between India and
Australia leads to different kinds of output
such as joint research papers, technology
transfer, joint development of products, etc.
The outcome of joint collaborative research is
not really documented in literature sources.
To gauge the outcome of collaborative
research is very difficult. However, the
co-authored papers resulting from the
collaborations give some idea about the
extent, mode and direction of collaborative
research between these two nations in
science and technology. An exercise has,
therefore, been undertaken to study the
extent of collaboration between India and
Australia, the areas of collaborative research
priorities, the nature of research collaboration,
and the collaboration linkages between their
institutions.

3. RESEARCH PRIORITIES
In India, the priority areas of research, as
reflected in distribution of papers are
chemistry, physics, biomedical research,
clinical medicine, and engineering and
technology. The publications output from
1986-88 to 1995-97 increased from 25.7% to
27.3% in chemistry, 16.2% to 20.2% in
physics, and 10.8% to 11.1% in engineering &
technology. For the corresponding period, the
publication output decreased from 15.1% to
13.6% in biomedical research and 12.6% to
12.3% in clinical medicine.
The other
disciplines receiving lesser priority during
1995-97 were biology (7%), earth & space
4
sciences (4.9%) and mathematics (1.1%) .
The share of internationally co-authored
papers in the Indian research output has
increased from 9.5% during 1986-88 to
15.7% during 1995-97. In chemistry, its share
has increased from 6.1% in 1986-88 to 10.0%
in 1995-97. The increase registered during
the corresponding period was from 12.9% to
22.8% in physics, 10.3% to 13.5% in
engineering and technology, 10.8% to 16.9%
in biology, and 13.8% to 25.2% in earth space
sciences. In terms of national research
priorities in Australia clinical medicine
continues to receive highest priority amongst
all disciplines. Its share in total publications
output remained almost the same 29.6% from
1986-88 to 1995-97. The other disciplines
receiving higher priority in Australia during
1995-97 were biology (15.5%), biomedical
research (13.0%), physics (8.9%), chemistry
(8.4%) earth & space sciences (6.7%) and
4
engineering & technology (5.6%) .
The share of internationally co-authored
papers in the Australian publications output
increased from 16.4% during 1986-88 to
27.6% during 1995-97. In clinical medicine,
its share of internationally co-authored papers
rose from 11.5% during 1986-88 to 21.9%
during 1995-97. The increase registered in
the percentage share of internationally
co-authored papers during the same period
for other disciplines was from 13.7% to 21.2%
in biology, 19.8% to 32.1% in biomedical
research, 19.8% to 37.7% in physics, 18.2%
to 27.5% in chemistry, 28.9% to 46.4% in

in engineering & technology, etc .

4. OVERALL PROFILE OF
COLLABORATION
India’s international collaboration in S&T
has shown increasing trend over the years.
India was collaborating with 86 countries
during 1986-88, which increased to 109
countries during 1995-97.
Against this,
Australia’s international collaboration with
different countries increased from 84 to 126
countries during the same period. India’s
research interest in Australian institutions for
collaboration is increasing over the years.
The Australian’s share in India’s International
co-authored papers has increased from 2.6%
during 1986-88 to 2.9% during 1995-97. In
contrast Australia’s has accorded less priority
to India in its internationally co-authored
papers.

5. OBJECTIVES
The aim of this paper is to study the
research collaborations of India with Australia,
using joint co-authored publications data. The
main objectives were: (i) To study the nature
of Indian collaboration in S&T with Australia;
(ii) To identify the broad subject areas of
these collaborations, (iii) To study the impact
of these collaborative research efforts in
different fields of S&T, and (iv) To identify the
major institutions in India and Australia
involved in these collaborative research
programs.

6. METHODOLOGY
The data for the study consisted of joint
publications
resulted
from
India’s
collaboration
with
Australia.
These
co-authored publications were derived from
CD-ROM version of the international
database, Science Citation Index (SCI), for a
period of five years, from 1995 to 1999. The
articles were classified under 10 major
disciplines and 58 sub-disciplines, according
to a scheme suggested by Computer Horizon
6

Inc. (CHI), USA. Each article is classified into
a main discipline and a sub-discipline using
the subject classification of the title of the
journal in which it was published. The nature
of the collaboration was defined as bilateral
and multilateral, depending upon the number
of countries participating in it, as reflected in
the affiliations of the authors. A research
paper was considered to indicate (i) bilateral
collaboration, when there was participation of
only two countries, one India and with
Australia, and (ii) multilateral collaboration,
when the participation was of three or more
countries, including India, Australia, and other
countries. The impact factor (IF) referred in
this study was taken from the Journal Citation
Report (ISI, USA), published annually. The IF
is the measure of citation frequency of any
paper on an average in any journal for a
particular year. IF may be defined as the
mean number of citations to papers published
in the journal in the preceding two years and
is available for approximately 5500 journals
covered in SCI database annually.

7. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
7.1 Distribution of S&T Papers by
Nature of Collaboration
As a result of collaboration between Indian
and Australian scientists from 1995 to 1999, a
total of 322 co-authored papers in S&T were
reported in Science Citation Index (SCI)
database. Thus, on an average there were 64
co-authored publications per year. There was
however,
no
systematic
growth
of
co-authored publications during the period;
although a sudden jump was observed after
1997. Of the total co-authored publications,
62.11% (200 papers) were bilateral in nature,
i.e. those involved the participation of Indian
and Australian scientists. The remaining
37.89% (122 papers) were multilateral in
nature, i.e. involving the participation of more
than two countries, i.e participation of other
countries along with India and Australia as
institutional authors (Table 1).

Of the 322 co-authored publications during
1995-99, 282 papers appeared as journal
articles, 21 as meeting abstracts, 10 as
letters, 5 as reviews, 2 as editorial-material
and 1 each as note and correction.

7.3 Distribution of Co-Authored
S&T Papers by Disciplines/
Sub-Disciplines
7.3.1 Disciplines
The co-authored papers have been
classified under 10 major fields and 58
sub-fields. The distribution of 322 co-authored
papers has been skewed towards Clinical
Medicine, Chemistry, Physics, and Earth &
Space
Sciences,
and
they
together
contributed 72.98% of the total papers. The
Biology, Engineering & Technology and
Biomedical Research together contributed
23.60% of the total papers (Table 2).
It has been observed that the collaborative
research was predominately-taking place
through bilateral efforts in Chemistry, Biology
and Engineering & Technology.
Bilateral
papers accounted for 88.52%, 83.33%, and
76.92% of the total co-authored papers in
these three disciplines. The share of bilateral
and multilateral co-authored papers was quite
close in Clinical Medicine, Physics, Earth &
Space Sciences, and Biomedical Research
(Table 2).

7.3.2 Sub- Disciplines
The distribution of co-authored papers in
each discipline into its various sub-disciplines
was also studied. The results are discussed
as follows:
(a)

Clinical Medicine

The 70 co-authored papers in Clinical
Medicine
are
scattered
across
21
sub-disciplines, with major focus on
ophthalmology (24 papers), general & internal
medicine (12 papers), cardiology (5 papers)
and endocrinology (4 papers).
Eight
sub-disciplines had contributed 2 papers each
and 9 sub-disciplines only one paper each.
Among the 12 sub-disciplines contributing 2
or more papers, the research was
predominantly bilateral in ophthalmology,
endocrinology, and pathology and multilateral
in general & internal medicine, cardiology,
environment and occupational health, and
fertility.
(b)

Chemistry

The 61 co-authored papers in Chemistry
are scattered across 6 sub-disciplines. The
focus was on two sub-fields, physical
7

chemistry and general chemistry, accounting
for 42.62%, and 27.86% of the total chemistry
output respectively.
Next in priority was
inorganic & nuclear chemistry and organic
chemistry, accounting together for 26.22% of
the total output.
The research was
predominately bilateral in all sub-fields,
except in organic chemistry, where there was
equal contribution of bilateral and multilateral
research papers.
(c) Physics
The 53 papers in Physics are scattered
across 7 sub-fields, the major focus was on
general physics, nuclear & particle physics,
applied physics and optics accounting for
30.18%, 30.18%, 18.86% and 13.20% of the

(g) Biomedical research
The 20 co-authored papers in Biomedical
Research are scattered in 7 sub-disciplines.
The major focus was on genetics & heredity
and microbiology, contributing 30% each out
of its total output.
The research was
predominately bilateral in parasitology and
multilateral in virology, nutrition & diet, and
cell biology cytology & history sub-fields.

7.4 Distribution of S&T
Co-Authored Papers by
Impact Factor
The impact of co-authored papers was
assessed through the impact factor of the
reporting journals where such joint research
was reported. The impact factor of
co-authored papers varied from 0.06 and 39.
The average impact factor of the all
co-authored papers has been worked out to
be 2.60; it was 2.52 for bilateral papers and
2.73 for multilateral papers.
Around 36% of the multilateral papers had
impact factor 2.5 and above. The quality of
bilateral research output, on the other hand,
is comparatively low, as only 24.5% of papers
had impact factor 2.5 and above.

10.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
The S&T collaboration between India and
Australia mainly took place through bilateral
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(6)

efforts and accounted for 62.11% of the total
collaborated papers. Clinical medicine,
chemistry, physics and earth & space
sciences were the priority areas for
collaborative
research,
accounting
for
21.74%. 18.94%, 16.46% and 15.84%
respectively of the total collaborated papers.
The joint research under broad disciplines
was highly scattered across various
sub-disciplines: 70 co-authored papers in 21
sub-disciplines were under clinical medicine;
61 co-authored papers in 6 sub-disciplines
were under chemistry; 53 co-authored papers
in 7 sub-disciplines under physics; 51
co-authored papers in 6 sub-disciplines under
earth & space sciences; 30 co-authored
papers (3 sub-disciplines) under biology; 26
co-authored papers (8 sub-disciplines) under
engineering
&
technology;
and
20
co-authored papers (7 sub-disciplines) under
biomedical research.
The focus of joint research under
sub-disciplines was in the following order:
ophthalmology (34.28%) and general &
internal medicine (17.14%) under Clinical
Medicine; physical chemistry (42.62%) and
general chemistry (27.86%) under Chemistry;
general physics (30.18%), nuclear & particle
physics (30.18%), applied physics (18.86%)
and optics (13.30%) under Physics;
astronomy & astrophysics (60.78%) and earth
& planetary sciences (25.49%) under Earth &
Space Sciences; agriculture & food science
(63.33%) and botany (33.33%) under Biology;
and
genetics&
heredity
(30%)
and
microbiology
(30%)
under
Biomedical
Research.
The priorities assigned to different subject
fields had different emphasis under bilateral
and multilateral research. Under bilateral
research, Chemistry, Clinical Medicine and
Biology are the priority areas, accounting for
27% 20% and 12.5%, respectively of the total
joint bilateral co-authored research output.
Under multilateral research, Clinical Medicine,
Physics and Earth & Space Sciences were
the priority areas, accounting for 24.59%
each of the total multilateral collaborative
output.
