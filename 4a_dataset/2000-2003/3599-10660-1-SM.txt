Wireless Media: A New Paradigm
Ashwani Kush & R K Chauhan
Abstract
In this review we have tried to represent knowledge about wireless media, which
is fast emerging as a new area in the field of computer science. Wireless
networks are emerging fast as latest technology, to allow users to access
information and services via electronic media, without taking geographic position
in account. Mobile hosts and wireless networking hardware are becoming widely
available, and extensive work has been done recently in integrating these
elements into traditional networks such as the Internet. We have tried to present
the basic knowledge required for a layman to know about Wireless media
starting from History to most current trends and trends still to come. This effort is
a part of research work by authors in mobile computing. The review is divided
into four parts as history, evolution of cellular networks, wireless devices and
types of wireless media. A tabular representation based on comparative study is
shown for wireless media attributes such as frequency range, cost, installation,
bandwidth and node capacity, etc.

1. HISTORY
Starting from Graham Bell to modern day
telephone a very long distance have been
traversed. We just take a peep into the past to
see how the development process in wireless
media has taken place.
Most closely connected with success of
Wireless communication is Gulielmo Marconi
in 1895 using long wave transmission with
very high transmission power (> 200 KW).
First transatlantic transmission followed in
1901. In 1907 first commercial transatlantic
connections were set up6. First radio
broadcast took place in 1906 when Reginald
A Fessendan transmitted voice and music for
Christmas. In 1915 first wireless voice
transmission was set up between New York
and San Francisco. First commercial radio
station started in 1920. In 1920, discovery of
short waves was done by Marconi. This
reduced size of antennas and high
transmission towers. In 1926 first telephone in
train was available (wires parallel to the
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23(3)

railroad track worked as antenna). First radio
for cars was commercially available in 1927.
1928 was year for many trials for Television
broadcasting. First telecasting started in 1932
from CBS station. Up to this all wireless
communication used amplitude modulation
which offered relatively poor quality due to
interference. In 1933 Edvin H Armstrong
discovered frequency modulation. In 1958
Germany has first network as analog A. Netz
using a carrier frequency of 160 MHz. In
1979, Denmark, Finland, Norway and
Sweden agreed upon NMT (Nordic mobile
telephone) system. It used 45 GHz carrier. In
1983 US started AMPS (advanced mobile
phone system) at 850 MHz. In 1984 Cordless
telephone came. Early 1990 marked use of
fully digital systems. In 1991 came DECT
(digital European cordless telephone) at 1800
2
MHz. In 1991 GSM (global system for mobile
communication) was standardized as a
document of more than 5000 pages. GSM
works at 900 MHz and uses 124 full duplex
channels. It offers full international roaming,
3

automatic location services, authentication,
encryption, high audio quality, etc., and also
S MS (short message service). Again more
efficient in bandwidth systems were
3
5
developed as TDMA (time division multiple
access) in 1996 and CDMA (code division
multiple access) in 1997 4 working at 1800
MHz. GSM has been switched to 1800 MHz,
now called DCS (digital cellular system). In
1997 IEEE 802.11 for LAN at 1.4 GHz was
standardized. 1998 marked the beginning of
mobile communication using satellites, also in
same year European agreed on UMTS
(universal mobile telecom system). UMTS
combined GSM with more efficient bandwidth
efficient CDMA solution.

2. EVOLUTION OF MOBILE
CELLULAR NETWORKS
(a) First Generation Mobile System: It
included
AMPS8 (advanced mobile
telephone system) made available in 1983.
It was first deployed in 1974 in Chicago,
with a service area of 2100 square miles.
Data rate of 10 kbps (Kilo bytes per second)
with 832 channels was offered. Also in
Europe
TACS
(total
access
communications system) was introduced
with 1000 channels and data rate of 8 kbps.
First generation supports voice traffic,
paging data and fax services.
(b) Second Generation Mobile System:
Second generation uses digital multiple
access technology, such as TDMA and
9
CDMA. GSM was introduced in this
category. Examples of second generation
systems are GSM, cordless telephone
second generation (CT2), Personal Access
Communication systems (PACS) and
10
DECT,
PHS (personal handy phone
system). Second generation systems are in
current use around the world. Second
generation systems support voice, limited
data communications, fax, SMS.
(c) 2.5 G Mobile Systems: The move into 2.5
G world will begin with GPRS (general
packet radio service). GPRS is a radio
technology for GSM. Network based on this
technique is known as EDGE (enhanced
data rate for GSM evolution). GPRS will
4

support flexible data transmission rates as
well as continuous connection to network.
11

(d) Third Generation Mobile systems : It is
faced with several challenging technical
issues, such as provision of seamless
services across both wired and wireless
networks and universal mobility. Advanced
multiple
access
techniques
are
investigated in this connection, one based
on wideband CDMA and another that uses
a hybrid TDMA/CDMA/FDMA approach.
Here new network technologies like ATM
(asynchronous transfer mode) backbone,
network management, and service creation
are integrated into existing second
generation core networks. Air interfaces
like Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) and
CDMA2000 are major third generation
radio standards.
(e) UMTS
(universal
mobile
telecommunication system): UMTS is
commonly referred to as a Third generation
system and is targeted to be deployed in
2003. UMTS uses an ATM based switching
network architecture and aims to provide
service for both mobile and fixed
subscribers by common call processing
procedures. UMTS will provide at least 144
kbps for full mobility, 384 kbps for limited
mobility applications and 2048 Mbps for low
mobility applications. UMTS terminals will
be multiband and multimode so that they
can work with different standards.
Cellular, cordless and PCS (personal
communication services) systems follow
different design guidelines. 12
Under cellular telephony comes AMPS
(advanced mobile telephone system), GSM,
DCS (digital cellular system) as major
designs.
Under Cordless category are CT2, DECT,
etc.
Under Low tier category are PHS, PACS,
etc.
Characteristics of Cellular, cordless and
13
low tier PCS are shown in table 1.

3. WIRELESS AND MOBILE
DEVICES
Sensor: A very simple wireless device is
represented by a sensor transmitting state
information. e.g. Switch sensing the office
door
Embedded
Controllers:
Applications
containing simple or complex controllers of
some type as Keyboard, Mouse, Washing
Machine, etc.
Pager: Simple receiver, a tiny display shows
text messages

Wireless media does not use an electrical
or optical conductor. For the data, the earth’s
atmosphere is the physical path for most
cases. When distances, obstructions make
bounded media difficult, then the wireless
media is very useful.

Mobile Phones: Simple phones, small size,
light weight. They are able to handle text,
graphics, color, audio and video
PDA
(Personal
Digital
Assistance):
Accompany a user and offer simple versions
of office software (calendar, mail, notepad,
etc.)

For computer network applications, radio
waves fall into three categories:
t Low power, sin gle fre quency
t High power, sin gle fre quency
t Spread – spec trum

4.1 Radio Wave Transmission
Systems
Radio waves frequency range is 10 KHz
and 1 GHz. In electromagnetic spectrum
range between 10 KHz and 1 GHz is also
called therefore (radio frequency). Radio
waves are of following types:

Table 2 represents basic features of three
14
types.
For all tables in this paper, the term Freq.
Range refers to frequency range. Cost refers
to cost of equipments and is evaluated
against performance it provides. Installation
refers to install guidelines, Installation may
depend on individual situation, general
comparison between media are taken.
Bandwidth capacity is data rates, the range of
frequencies
that
a
medium
can
accommodate. Bandwidth is measured in
terms of the number of bits that can be
transmitted across a given medium per
second. Node capacity refers to how many
computers you can easily attach to the
network. EMI refers to immunity from
electromagnetic interference. It is caused by
outside electromagnetic waves affecting the

³ Short wave
³ Very high frequency (VHF) and FM radio
³ Ultra high frequency (UHF) radio and
Television
Most radio frequency are regulated.
Regulated frequencies ensure clear radio
transmission. Radio waves can be broadcast
omni directionally or directionally. Various
types of antennas can be used for
broadcasting.
Some of most commonly used antennas
are (figure 2):

desired signal, making it difficult for receiving
computer to decode it.

4.2

Microwave Transmission
System

Microwave system uses lower gigahertz
frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum.
These frequencies are higher than radio
frequencies.
They
produce
better
performance and throughput.
Microwave data communication systems
are of following types:
t Ter res trial
t Satellite

Terrestrial use directional parabolic
antennas to send and receive signals.
Microwave links connect separate buildings
where cabling is difficult or expensive.
Satellite systems transmit signals between
directional
parabolic
antennas.
Main
difference between satellite system and
terrestrial system is that in a satellite system
one antenna is on a satellite in
geosynchronous
orbit
about
50,000
kilometers above the earth. Because of this,
satellite microwave systems can reach the
most remote places on earth and
communicate with mobile devices. LAN sends
a signal through cable media to antenna,
which beams the signal to the satellite in orbit
above the earth. The orbiting antenna then
transmits the signal to another location on the
earth or, if the destination is on the opposite

side of the earth, to another satellite, which
then transmits to a location on earth. There
are some propagation delays which may
range from .5 to 5 seconds. Table 3 shows
some features of the two microwave data
communication systems.

4.3

Infrared Systems

Infrared media uses infrared light to
transmit signals. Light emitting diodes (LED)
transmit the signals, and photodiodes receive
the signals. From electromagnetic spectrum,
infrared uses terahertz range (high frequency
range). The remote controls of different
electronic devices uses this technology.
Though infrared signals have a good
throughput, but problem is that they cannot
pass solid materials, also they are diluted by
strong light sources. Infrared allows both
point to point and broadcast transmission.
Point to point allows better transmission rate,
but devices must be within its location, and on
other side, broadcasting gives more flexibility
but rate of data transfer is slow. Table 4
represents basic features of two types of
infrared transmission.
Point to Point: Infrared beams can be tightly
focused and directed at a specific target.
Careful alignment of transmitter and receiver
is required.
Broadcast: Broadcast infrared systems
spread the signal to cover a wider area and
allow reception of the signal by several

5. MOBILE APPLICATIONS
Future Wireless communication is going to
help the user in a lot of ways. A few future
applications are projected here.
n With help of mobile devices you will be
able to download e-mails, update
schedules, change meeting times,
transfer files thus helping in office
environment.
n Most flight reservations can be done
online. Next step will be, when you enter
airport, the airline reservation system
would be able to respond to your mobile
device. When you enter the terminal, your
device will communicate to airline system
and all your formalities regarding,
boarding pass, etc. will be taken care of.
n Home devices could also be wirelessly
enabled.
A
user’s
device
could
communicate with home devices to
unlock doors, activate lights and home
audio and video entertainment units,
adjust heating/cooling settings to preset
preferences and also deactivate security
alarms.
n User driving a car in a foreign state can
receive e-mail messages via wide area
wireless system installed in the car.
n Wireless RF (radio frequency) tags can
be used in shopping malls and can be
used to provide pricing, sale and stock
information. This will enhance shopping
lifestyle
and
increase
inventory
productivity.
n Also in modern battlefield wireless
communication
has
become
very
important.

CONCLUSION
This technical review gives a brief
reference about, what is a wireless
environment and how have we reached to the
current small, presentable cellular devices. A
lot of technological revolution has taken place
in the span of time to reach at modern
wireless media. This media can now transmit
8

audio, video and text and that too with much
faster speed and accuracy. We studied
different range patterns for wireless medium
and assigned metric parameters such as cost,
installation, frequency range, bandwidth
capacity, node capacity and EMI (immunity
from electromagnetic spectrum ).
It was inferred that:
t Com puter net works ap pli ca tions uses Ra dio

frequency range (from 10 KHz to 1 GHz),
which falls into three categories as Low
power-single fre quency, High power-Single
fre quency and Spread-spectrum.
t Microwave data com mu ni ca tion syst e m
uses lower GHz frequency range for
transmission, uses terrestrial medium and
sat el lite me dium.
t Infrared uses terahertz frequency range
(high range) for trans mis sion, uses point to
point and broad cast sys tem.
Taking maximum metrics into account, is
was seen that Satellite medium is better
option than Terrestrial and Point to point
transmission is better than Broadcast
transmission. Future use of mobile devices in
daily life has also been discussed and it is
further emphasized that all this still need a lot
of security features to implement and also a
better QOS (quality of service). Our future
study is based on these parameters.
