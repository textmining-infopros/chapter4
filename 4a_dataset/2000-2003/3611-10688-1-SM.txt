Mailing Lists 
Shamprasad M Pujar, GK Manjunath, Mahesh N Juttiyavar 
Abstract 
Mailing lists are vital communication tools used by the academic and research community for sharing knowledge and to discuss latest developments and related issues in specific subject area. These also serve as forum for seeking technical assistance or sharing such knowledge in an informal way by cutting all the geographical barriers. This article intends to highlight the usefulness of mailing lists, with a special reference to librarians, highlights the issues related to  the mailing lists and also annotates the popular mailing lists in the field of library 
and information science. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Internet not only offers a rich source of information, but also serves as an excellent tool for professional interaction and collaboration. The mailing lists, which are the by-products of internet, serve as important tools for collaborating research and professional activities among faculty, scientists, researchers, students, etc.  These provide means for a group of users to establish an e-mail forum on any topic of common interest. Mailing lists enable members to exchange information or make queries about specific topic with all the other members of the group. These lists are also used for distributing newsletters to the registered/subscribed members. These lists are becoming popular among library professionals too for similar above discussed activities. Mailing lists are synonym to list servers and internet newsgroups.  
2. WHAT IS A MAILING LIST? 
A mailing list is a group of e-mail addresses identified by a single name or single ID. When an e-mail message is sent on  this ID/name, it is automatically forwarded to 
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2003, 23(6) 
all the addresses on the list. In other words, all the members on the list get the same message. The result is similar to a newsgroup  or forum, except that the messages are transmitted over e-mail and are therefore available only to the members on the list. The  software used for the management and distribution of mailing lists to the subscribers is known as 'List Server'.  
In addition to sending the messages over e-mail to the registered members, messages will also be made available online on the website of the designated service provider for  a specified period. However, access to non-registered members depends on the way  mailing lists are set up. If open to the public, anybody can view the messages. If not, one has to register with the list for accessing the messages. Similarly, newsletters can also be sent using the mailing lists service to the registered members by various organisations and websites at regular intervals. 
Mailing lists are of two types—moderated and un-moderated. In case of moderated list, a moderator does verification of mails before forwarding to the members of the list. Moderator censors irrelevant e-mails such as

unethical, abusive mails or Spam and also such mails sent by members who have un-subscribed the service. In case of un-moderated lists, no body verifies the content of e-mails; they will be immediately distributed to all the members in the list. Even  through un-moderated lists co-exist; their number has come down in recent days because of Spam and other kind of annoying and business mails.  
Figure 1 and 2 show the diagrammatic representation of mailing list. 
Although several mailing lists can be subscribed free of cost, some list servers charge a nominal yearly fee. A new subscriber registers with the list server through registration page. Any one can subscribe to any of the mailing lists depending on his or her interest. Subscription information will be usually available on the websites of the service providers. Data

validator validates details of the subscriber and the details are transferred to the database after successful validation. Similarly  the subscriber’s e-mail addresses will be removed from the database, once they 'unsubscribe' from the list. 
Whenever any e-mail message is sent to the mailing list, the message is automatically forwarded to all the subscribers of that list, in many cases with the approval of the moderator.

4. USE OF MAILING LISTS 
Mailing lists help librarians in information dissemination to their members and professionals alike. The information could be about library services, products, newsletter, events, placements, etc. These also help to a greater extent in knowledge and resource sharing activities among librarians. 
4.1 Marketing of Library Services  
Mailing lists can be used to market library services/products which otherwise would be marketed using printed brochures, thus making it cost effective. Another advantage would be its reach. It can reach any number of participants simultaneously with same cost. 
4.2 Discussion by Professionals 
Mailing lists can be used as tool for professional discussions and to inform events  such as conference, training programmes, etc.  
They have also been used as forum for seeking solution to some of the local technical  problems, creating awareness about the new technology, availability of free software or journal and some time to find out availability of certain specific documents. In other words these serve as tool for knowledge sharing. One good example of such a list or forum is lis-forum of NCSI, Bangalore. 
4.3 Sending Newsletters 
The mailing lists are now being immensely  used to send e-newsletters to all the registered members. These e-newsletters will have same characteristics as their print counter parts with same coverage. In view of the cost saving, the members can be encouraged to write articles on contemporary topics. 
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2003, 23(6) 
4.4 Resource Sharing 
Mailing lists can be effectively used as tool  for resource sharing among the libraries. Information about weeded out books, back volumes of journals or availability of duplicate issues of journals can be brought to the attention of the participating members. Some times the personal collection of academicians is offered to the libraries free of charge. Therefore, even the non-library professionals who are in the academics may also be encouraged to participate in the forum. 
5. MAILING LISTS IN LIS

6.  PARTICIPATION IN MAILING 
LISTS 
The first level of participation or involvement starts with registration and observing the discussion by the other members. It creates awareness about the topic and the protocols also known as 'Email etiquette'. Then starts the transition, from observation to the active participation. There are two ways of participation in the second level. First, by making the query and secondly  by answering some one else's query. The objectives of the mailing lists can only be achieved by active participation either by sending a query or by answering it. Even a write up about the new developments without any query can also be termed as active participation. Regular interaction with the members develops a sense of belongingness and encourages other mute observers to participate actively. 
7. HOW TO RUN A MAILING LIST 
Mailing list may be run by anybody by using any of the free internet based services like Yahoo Groups, but one needs to sign up for the service. Before starting a particular mailing list one should be clear about his or her topic of interest and find out whether there is any such list already in operation. Search for existing lists on a specific topic may be done on the net by using any of the search engines or directories. It is better to avoid duplicating the efforts in the same topic.  However, running list at local level would be a  good idea in spite of the presence of similar lists at the international level. This can be used mainly for discussing issues specific to a  particular geographical location or particular group or association. 
Some of the Internet sites, which host mailing lists free of cost, are: 
n http://www.freelists.org (only technology 
related) 
n http://www.topica.com

========5========

n http://groups.yahoo.com 
n http://www.yourmailinglistprovider.com 
One may also run mailing list on their own server using any of the free mailing lists software. Mailman is one such software available in public domain at http://www.list.org 
CONCLUSION 
Mailing list creates a sense of belongingness among professionals, assist in reviving the contacts and bring people together to work for a common cause. It strengthens the bond of librarianship thereby motivating members to share knowledge among with fellow librarians. Lastly and most importantly, the active participation makes any  list lively, interesting and informative. On the contrary, many of the lists get contribution only from very few members while others are silent observers.
