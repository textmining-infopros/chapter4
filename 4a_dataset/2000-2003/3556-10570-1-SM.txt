publishing and the related methodology up to their pros and cons. It is one-step
guide for the Hindi website development. It provides comprehensive instructions
and real world examples, for special coverage of the topics on Hindi website
designing and offers advice for developing a truly dynamic Hindi website, on
parallel lines to which any multilingual website can be developed. This article is
of interest to web developers interested in building dynamic, interactive Hindi
websites and for those who are looking for a quick, effective way to build
embedded fonts for the web.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Defence Research and Development
Organisation (DRDO) has its website on the
internet, for the last few years. The website is
designed, developed and maintained by
&
Defence
Scientific
lnformation
Documentation Centre (DESIDOC). The site
is currently publishing its contents in English.
Being a widely used site, efforts have been
made to create its Hindi version so as to
make it accessible to a larger number of
interested users. Creation of a website,
especially in Hindi, is a very complex task and
needs command over language in which
website will be designed, various fonts and
other related technologies; this article covers
the technical specifications and evaluation
criteria for the Hindi Website and increases
the curiosity to cruise into the technicality of
developing the website in Hindi.
The paper is a detailed description of the
technicalities involved in the development of a
Hindi website so that a person having the
basic knowledge of web development even
can create the site in Hindi or any other
regional language. This article is designed
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2002,22(2)

keeping this in mind that the reader of this
paper should not face any problem in coming
up with his regional language website due to
lack of proper literature and the technicalities
at one place. Considering the problems faced
by many users in designing of a multilingual
website, this article was designed to pave a
straight and flawless path for the readers.
The prerequisite for developing a Hindi
website, is basic knowledge of web page
designing which is not a difficult task.
Designing of a web page is as simple as
creating a document using Microsoft Word.
There are many HTML editors which are used
for web page development; some of the
frequently & commonly used are Microsoft
Frontpage and Macromedia Dream Weaver.
Many HTML Editor are freely available on the
internet. One can also design a web page
using MS Word 2000.

NEED FOR MULTILINGUAL
WEBSITE

English is not going to serve effectively in
every place the world over. Multilingual sites
are websites that have country-specific
3

language content. Paralleling the growth of
the public internet is the spread of intranets
and extranets throughout the global
enterprise. Businesses are enabling their
information systems, moving mission-critical
business applications to p~werful private
networks based on web technologies.
Systems for order processing, inventory
tracking, supply chain management, and
invoicing are moving to the web. Enabling
systems to tap the power of the web offers a
key competitive advantage to global
companies who need to conduct business
across geographies and time zones. In a
global place where customers, suppliers, and
co-workers are international gnd located
worldwide, multilingual content is integral to
effective and efficient communication.
As internet technologies permeate the
enterprise and the web continues to evolve
into a global mass medium, the profile of the
internet user is rapidly changing. There is a
direct
correlation
between
increased
international usage and decreased viability of
the English-only web. Today users are coming
online with all levels of technical and linguistic
aptitudes, making multilingual content a key
ingredient to a successful global web strategy.
is a global
World Wide Web (W)
medium and websites should also address
the
non-English-speaking
audience,
otherwise the efficacy of any web presence is
reduced. Web users may first search for
content in their native language and will
switch to English only if they can't find the
information they are seeking. Multilingual
content adds a layer of richness and
functionality to any site. Creating a
multilingual website is one of the best ways to
transcend linguistic barriers and 'directly
speak' to the target viewer's language. Major
search engines such as Yahoo, Lycos, and
Excite offer a good case in point. They all
allow for multilingual searching and the
content with in search categories is tailored to
the interests of each place.
The basic architecture of site will also
influence how one prioritise what to localise
and for which place. The site may be
database-driven, static, application-rich or
4

more likely some hybrid. It may contain
frequently updated content published at
predictable intervals, or may incorporate
erratic or constant data streams. Publishing a
multilingual site ensures that content will be
accessible and acceptable to local visitors,
allowing them to uttlise the site.

3. TECHNICAL FEATURES
In delivering a multilingual website, apart
from translation of images and text, there are
also various technical considerations to take
into account when providlng multilinguak
content for visitor. One of the most important
consideration is to be aware of how the visitor
interacts with the site to find the information
he needs. If a visitor can fill out a contact
form, order items generated by a database,
one should make sure that he can find the
information that he needs for them, as well as
effectively respond to their inquiries.
One does not need to completely localise
all the content within a site. For example, a
database used for online ordering that stores
the size, color and styles of various products
would not require localisation. The user
interface would have to be translated in to th'e
target place language, but the items the user
is selecting and the items that are being
referenced in the database would remain in
English.

3.1 Browsers and Font
Visitors can see only that text in a web
page, which uses those fonts, which are
installed on the visitor's computer. For those
pages published in English and other
European languages, Aria1 and Times New
Roman fonts are often used because they are
standard fonts supplied with Microsoft
Windows for PCs and also with Apple
Macintosh computers. These fonts also
support most European languages and the
user can set their browser to their own
language. Pages published in other
languages such as Japanese or Russian use
fonts supplied with the specific language
version of Windows or Mac operating system.
If a web page is designed using a font that is
not installed on the visitor's computer, the
browser will substitute another default font in
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2002,22(2)

its place. For English this means that the text
will still be meaningful even if the font has
changed, but other languages like Hindi will
often be displayed as meaningless English
characters because the required characters
for that language are missing.

3.2 Technologies for Publishing
Hindi Website
To deliver a multilingual website, three
methods are available. Using which one can
publish his website in Hindi. But each of them
has some associated disadvantages of which
a detailed description is given in following
paragraphs. The technologies for publishing
any multilingual website are:
o lmage Display
o Font Downloading
o Font Embedding

3.2.1 lmage Display
This is the simplest solution for presenting
Hindi script on a web page. A section or page
of typed or hand-written Hindi can be scanned
into image-processing software and made
into an image file for the web. The most
popular image file format for this is GIF
(graphical image format) because the number
of colours in the image can be reduced to
make the image file size smaller. An image of
text could be reduced to just two colours,
black and white, but because the Hindi script
is quite intricate it may be better to use 16
colours so that the outlines of the characters
is smooth (a process known as anti-aliasing).
Disadvantages
A large amount of text would require a
large Image file or number of files, which
would make the page slow to load in the
user's browser. Any alterations or updation in
the text require a completely new revision to
be produced, scanned, and made into an
image file. Although creating an image map
around words which can make links, the
image would require more memory if these
link words were to be in another colour. lmage
files of text generally offer poor reproduction
in printed format so the user will not be able
to make a good print out of the page.
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2002,22(2)

Large images, video clips, and flash
movies can take an inordinate amount of time
to download for any users who may still be
using a 14.4 or 28.8 kbps modem. Thus a
slow modem with poor telephone lines and
costly internet access fees means that site
may suddenly have a very frustrated user.
Good web design takes these issues into
account while creating a site.

3.2.2 Font Downloading
One way to ensure that a web page is
displayed correctly is to allow the users to
download the required Hindi font in which the
website will be designed. The page publisher
can provide the Hindi font file for download or
a small program that will install the font
directly onto the user's computer. Once
installed, the page will be displayed in the
correct Hindi font whenever the user revisits
the page. With the font installed, the time it
takes for the browser to load the text is the
same as for any English language page.
Disadvantages
Some Hindi fonts are available in the
public domain and have been used by several
web publishers, but as there is no common
coding standard for Hindi fonts, it is possible
that several fonts will be required to view
various web pages published using this
method. So the users have to install many
fonts required for viewing correctly different
websites. It can take several minutes for the
user to download and install the required font.
Different versions of the font are required for
both Apple Macintosh ana PC platforms.
There is currently no Hindi font compafibles
on both systems.

3.2.3 Font Embedding
This is the most popular method for
publishing Hindi web pages on the internet in
which the font is embedded with web pages.
A company named Bitstream has developed
WebFont Wtzard that allows any font to be
'embedded' on a web page. It works by
converting the text into a graphical format
which can be displayed using a 'font player',
now a component of the Netscape browser,
but also available for MSlE via a download.
Microsoft provides WEFT tool for creating a
5

dynamic font object to embed any font in web
pages but these pages can only be viewed
from MSIE. All online newspapers and portals
are using font-embedding technique on their
sites.
Netscape and Microsoft each has its own
technology for embedding fonts. Both
browsers MSlE and Netscape Navigator are
using different technologies. However, there
are some ways to make pages to be
displayed correctly in both browsers. The
technique is discussed at the end of this
article.

3.3

Types of Font

The basic font formats available so for are:
o Postscript Type 1 is the veteran font format
from Adobe.
o TrueType was originally developed by
Apple and is now built into the Macs and
PCs operating systems. It makes better
on-screen display.
o OpenJype is a newer format created by
Microsoft and Adobe that attempts to
merge features of Postscript Type 1 and
TrueType.
Postscript Type 1, TrueType, and
OpenType fonts can not be embedded in its
native format. These fonts have to be
converted into one of these new formats
before using:
o Embedded Open Type (E0T)-from
Microsoff
o Portable Font Resource (PFR)-from
Netscape and Bitstream
The above two formats are the new font
standards, each of them has some limitations:
Neither works with all the font formats nor is
supported by every web browser. PFR format
is supported by Netscape Navigator but to
view PFR format fonts in MSlE (Wlndows
only), the user must be willing to install an
ActiveX control (provided by Bitstream).While
EOT format is supported by MSlE and for this
format users dont't have to install any ActiveX
control. TrueType fonts can be converted into
EOT and TrueDoc (PFR) formats. These EOT
and PFR formats are called dynamic fonts.
6

3.3.1 Dynamic fonts
Dynamic font is the special type of font
that provides web masters to develop content
of their sites using any font they have in their
systems. Dynamic fonts are autol-natically
downloaded along with the web pages in
which they are embedded, in the user's
temporary directory as image files do, instead
of relying on the default fonts that users have
in their browsers, with the assurance that
those pages will be displayed in a browser
with their font formatting intact. Internet fonts
and Web fonts are aliases for dynamic fonts.
These fonts are especially useful in case
of web pages containing Indian language
contents because it is not always possible
that the Hindi language fonts used to develop
these web pages will be installed on the
client's machine. If the Hindi language web
page is using a font, which is not present in
the client's machine and the web page does
not contain any dynamic fonts then the page
will not be in a readable format and will show
meaningless characters using default fonts.
Dynamic Fonts files are browser specific. It
means that these files are different for MSlE
and Netscape Navigator. Moreover, dynamic
fonts files are supported only by MSlE 4.0 &
above and Netscape 4.03 & above.
Currently, Dynamic Fonts are available for
all
Microsoft
Windows
platforms
(Win9x/NT12000) and Macintosh platforms on
the client side. The server side can be
runnlng any web server on any operating
system. Navigator uses the PFR format, and
MSIE uses EOTfiles.

4. METHODOLOGY
4.1 Using Dynamic Fonts
4.1.7 Requirements
The development of a multilingual web site
contains various resources. Hindi web page
can be designed using a number of specific
requirements. The first requirement is that
user should have knowledge of using any
HTML editor or MS Word. This article can not
cover HTML basics as a complete book will
be needed for it and in this little article it IS not
possible. The second requirement is True
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2002.22(2)

Type Font. This font will be used for web
page designing so select the suitable Hindi
font. Third is the HTML Editor which best
suites the needs. Nowadays many editors are
available
like
Microsoft
Frontpage,
Macromedia Dreamweaver and even MS
word has the facility to save documents as
HTML page. Fourth requirement are the tools
(WEFT and WebFont W~zard)for converting
normal font into dynamic font. Final
requirement is the web server where web
pages will be uploaded. Web server can be
on any operating system.

4.1.2 Step-wise Procedure
(a) To design a web pages in Hindi install a
True Type Hindi font in the system. A Hindi
font can be downloaded from internet or a
new font created using any font creator
program.
A sample keyboard layout of Hindi
language is shown in fig 1 and fig 2 is an
example with shift key
(b) Now type a web page using the selected
Hindi font in any HTML editor i.e., Microsoft
Frontpage, Macromedia Dream Weaver or
Netscape Composer. Also any MS Word
document can be converted in HTML
format.
(c) Create a dynamic font object ( eot file)
using WEFT tool and portable font ( pfrfile)
from WebFont Wizard.
Fig 3. is an example of DESlFONT created
by DESIDOC.The step-by-step procedure
of creating dynamic font using both tools is
given in the next paragraph.
(d) Make the following changes in html
document:

Figl. Sample keyboard of Hindi language
DESlDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2002,22(2)

First change in HTML document is to add
link tag to associate the PFR with web page.
A link tag tells the browser to associate or
'link' another file with an HTML document. In
this case, the link tag tells the browser where
to find the font information in the PFR for
rendering the fonts on the screen. Place link
tags in the document between the <head>
and </head> tags. It can be copied from the
ReadMe.html file generated each time when
a PFR file is created. For example if a
dynamic font is created as desifontpfr then
<link> tag looks like this:
<link REL="fontdef"
SRC="http://poppy/desifont.pfr">
Where poppy is the name of server. Add
this link tag in the header of HTML document.
The SRC attribute is the bnly part of the tag
that changes. It identifies the name and
location of the PFR. Use absolute or relative
paths, depending upon how to 'structure web
site.
Add one <link> tag for each PFR to be
used, and make sure to add it in each page
that uses this font. Although the browser
stores the PFR in the cache, include the
<link> tags on each page of site to make sure
the browser always has the font available.
Next change is to specify the font to be
used in the web pages. There are many
methods for specifying a font within HTML.
Two possible methods include:
Use of a font tag and specifying a face
attribute
o Use of a cascading style sheet (CSS)
In the first method of specifying a font is to
specify formatting attributes for the text in the

font tag. The face attribute specifies the name
of a font. Other font attributes include color
and size. Here is an example of a font tag that
specifies a face attribute.
<font face="DESIFONT" size=2>
insert some text here
</font>
The second method of specifying a font is
the use of style sheet. Cascading Style Sheet
(CSS) can be used to specify fonts in HTML
documents. Three types of CSS can be used
i.e., inline, embedded, or linked style sheets.
There are several ways to specify a font in a
style sheet. One method is to use the
,font-family attribute. Here is an example of a
CSS that uses the font-family attribute to
format the tags.
<STYLE TY PE="text/cssn>
P{
Font-family: "DESIFONT
}
</STYLE>
If EOT and PFR both type of dynamic
fonts are created then following script should
be used to associate both files in the web
page. To automate this process, add the
script in all web pages. In this case there is no
need of writing a link tag and style sheet, as
already stated, this script will automatically do
these things. This script will automatically
detect the client's browser and will provide
links to .eot and .pfr according to browsers. In
the case of Netsscape it will provide link tag

to pfr file and if it is MSlE then it will write
style sheet for .eot file.
<script language=']avascnpt">
akm = parselnt(navigator.appVersion);
if (akm >= 4)
{
if (navigator.appName == "Netscape")
document.write("<linkrel='fontdef'
src='http://delhi/web/desifont.pfr'>");
else
{
document.write ('<style type="text1css1'>'J;
dbcument.write (' @font-face (');
document.write
('
font-family:
DESIFONT'+"\;");
document.write (' font-style: normal'+"\;");
document.write (' font-weight: normal'+"\;");
document write (' src: uri("http://delhhveb/
DESlFONO E O V ');
document.write
document.write ('</style>');
(I)');

</script>
(e) After appropriate changes, HTML pages
should be uploadedwith PFRand EOTfiles
on web server as usual. Keep in mind that
transfer of PFR files should be using binary
(not ASCII) transfer mode. If PFR files are
transferred using ASCII mode, the browser
can not read the PFR file. This embedded
font should now be working in both MSlE
and Netscape Navigator browsers.

4.1.3 Other Settings
4.1.3.1 MIME Settings for PFR Type
Files
In order to host a site that uses PFR web
fonts, the web server must be set up to
recognize the PFR MlME type. The MlME
type is application/font-tdpfr which has file
extension pfr. The Netscape Enterprise
server already has this MIME type defined. If
Windows NT 4 server is being used, and web
server is internet information server (IIS) then
\IS Server Management Console is used to
set the MlME type in the 'File Types' section
of the server's 'Properties'. To set the MlME
type open IIS Server Management Console.
Select server computer in the right window.
Select 'Properties' in the left pane. Click 'File
Types'. Under Extension, type pfr. Under
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002,22(2)

MIME type, type applicationlfont-tdpfr. Click
'OK' and exit IIS Server Management
Console and Restart the server.

4.1.3.2 WebFont Player for MSIE
This section is for those who don't want to
create an EOT dynamic font want their pages
to be viewed in MSIE. Viewing PFR dynamic
fonts in MSIE for Windows requires WebFont
player. The player is built into Netscape
Communicator for W~ndows,Macintosh, and
UNIX. For site visitors who use MSIE for
Windows need to download WebFont player,
host this WebFont player on his web site or
give it a link to bitstream site. Site visitors only
need to download the player only once.
To link to the WebFont Player, insert the
following lines of code in the document HEAD
(between the <head> and </head> tags).
Insert these lines after the LINK tags for PFRs
add these lines
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="javascriptV
src="http://poppyAdserver.js">
</SCRIPT>
Add these lines to every page that uses
dynamic fonts. Where src attribute points to
wherever WebFont player files including the
file tdserver.js are stored. WebFont player is
freely downloadable from Bitstream's website.
Download it and install in web server.
A sample page created in Hindi language
using DESIFONT is displayed as Fig. 4.
This is the complete procedure of creating
a web page in Hindi language. The next
section will cover the operations required
using both tools.

5. OPERATION
This section will cover each step of
creating a dynamic font from a normal font.
The step by step procedure of creation of a
dynamicfont is given below:
o Microsoft WEFT 3
Bitstream's WFW
Both tools have their importance in
creation of a dynamic font because WEFT will
create a file with .eot extension and WebFont
Wizard will produce a file having .pfr
extension. In the previous sections it is
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,2002,22(2)

Fig 4. Sample page created in Hindi
language using DESIFONT
described that .eot file will be used for MSIE
and .pfr file for Netscape Navigator. So this
section will cover the process of creation of
dynamic fonts using both tools.

5.1

Microsoft WEFT 3

Web Embedded Font Tool (WEFT) is
provided by Microsoft and freely available on
Microsoft website. This tool is used for
creation of dynamic fonts from a normal true
type font. As previous sections describes
about dynamic fonts this tool is used for
creation of EOT font. This font will be used for
MSIE. Creation of a dynamic font using
WEFT is very simple method. Download
WEFT from Microsoft website and install it.
After installation, start it, in the first screen it
will prompt for name and email address. On
the next screen (fig 5.1.1), it will ask to enter
location of the web pages to embed fonts.
Enter the location of web page or use browse
button and click' Add' to add the pages (fig
5.1.2).
In this process it will automatically include
those pages whose link is given in this page.
It will also accept URL in the form of http:ll
else use the browse button to specify any
web page from hard disk. When pages will be
added the panel will show a tree view to those
page.
If there are more pages then add them. If
there are pages that show up don't need
embedded fonts to appear, select the page
9

Fig 5.1.1 Add web pages
and click 'Exclude'. After adding all pages
click 'Next' to continue.
Now WEFT will analyze all pages and it
scans for all the fonts currently used on these
pages. After the analysis is complete, a list of
all the fonts used on these pages will be
displayed.
Next to each font name, there is an icon
showing whether the font can be embedded
or not. A brief explanation appears for each
font in the 'Info' column. The 'Embed' column
tells if each font is currently set to be
embedded. 'Chars' column displays the
number of characters used for each font on
those pages. Select the required fonts to
embed by eliminating all the others by
selecting them and click 'Don't Embed'. If it is
required to embed an additional font that isn't
shown in the list, click the 'Add' button (fig
5.1.3).

Fig 5.1.3 Select font
Embed only those characters used on web
pages, not the entire font, this will keep the
generated file very small in size. But it is not
always useful such as if anyone wants to
generate file and that will be used for every
page regardless of character sub setting he
should select no sub setting required.
Because if anyone selects a sub setting, then
each page will require new file because it
should have characters included in that page.
After selecting font to be, embed click
'Next' button this will show 'Create Font
Objects Screen' (fig 5.1.4). Enter the location
where dynamic font file to be saved. It also
supports FTP, so it can even save the file
directly to the server.
In WEFT there is a provision for users to
create dynamic fonts for their websites so that
web pages using these dynamic fonts can
only be viewed from their websites and this

domain names from where this dynamic font
will be served.

To create a PFR file bitstream provides
WebFont Wizard (WFW) tool. A trial version
of this tool can be downloaded or purchased
from Bitstream. Now start WebFont Wizard by
double-clicking WebFont Wizard icon to start
the application. In the first screen (fig 5.2.1) it
will show some helpful instructions about how
to create a dynamic font. Click 'Next' to begin
creation of dynamic font.

Fig 5.1.5 Binding domain names
For each URL, click 'Add' to add it to the
list. Add all domain names where this font will
be used. This font can be used from these
sites only; no other domain could use this
font. When finished, click 'OK. Check the box
labeled
'Show

6. INTERACTIVE PAGES
This is an advanced topic for those users
who are already in the field of web designing
and wants to design their interactive web
pages in Hindi/Multilingual language. So
before starting to design an interactive Web
pages in Hindi, users must have some
knowledge of any scripting language and their
static web page in Hindi should be wor)itng
properly. Interactive pages are those pages
used for taking information from users and
render conformant and relevant output using
that information. In the process of designing
interactive pages there are two main steps:
(a) To design a form that will accept data from
users, and
(b) Handling that data and giving output using
that data.
When users will submit their data using
that form the data will be handled by a script
on the server. This script will read data
entered by users and process it and then give
result page. These pages are designed using
any scripting languages i.e., ASP, JSP, PHP
and PERL. As shown in this article. In static
pages embed .pfr and eot files in headers of
all output pages. An example of an interactive
web page is given in Appendix A.

world but even to rural areas. The web
provides the campestral agencies with
constant and global exposure, heightening the
need for careful attention to rural branding
and product marketing. The question is no
longer when or whether to go ahead with
meeting the requirements of our societal
community; it's how to manage the process to
derive the greatest benefit from our global
web presence. If anyone approaches site
design with nationalistic mindset, taking
structure, artistic, and content into account, he
will ensure an architecture that can support
any Indian language he wants to go for, and.
to begin with, Hindi can never be second
choice. Web is a global medium, if anyone
doesn't address the national Hindi speaking
audience, the potency and patronage of his
web presence will be diminished. Creating a
Hindi website for nationalistic, public-spirited,
and zealous target surfers is one of the best
ways to transcend linguistic barriers and
articulate his language.

Appendix A

T h ~ s appendix has some informat~on about designing of interactive web pages using
Hind~IMult~ilingual
language. After completing the process of designing static web pages users want
to design their interactive web pages. Before designing interactive web pages in Hindi users must
ensure that their static pages are working fine then they should proceed. This appendix will
demonstrate the step by step procedure of design~ngan interactive page:
Step 1. Create form using any HTML editor like FrontPage, Macromedia Dream Weaver, etc. (fig 6.)
HTML for the above form is given below.

Step 2. Now write script for processing this form
Web designer can use any scripting language like ASP, JSP, PHP or PERL. When the user will
submit that form the data will be processed by this script and after processing result will be
displayed in Hindi. To use these script users must have some knowledge of PERL because this
example uses PERL Script.

After processing, this script will generate the output as shown in Fig 7.
This example shows that user can enter data in Hindi language but he should also know keyboard
layout of this font. But if user cannot type in Hindi language, a virtual keyboard layout can be provided
on the screen atop his pages, from which he can select specific key by a click of the mouse. But this

Fig 7. Output after processing the form
can make the input process too slow. Another option available with the site developer is to provide a
transliteration software in his web page where the user can type Hindi in phonetic English like 'MEW
BHARAT MAHAN' and it automatically gets converted in to the Hindi scripts as "Maora Baart Mahana".
