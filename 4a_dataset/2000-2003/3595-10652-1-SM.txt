INTRODUCTION

Today, libraries are functioning under
constantly changing environment and face a
variety of complex challenges like information
explosion, IT revolution, network evolution,
shrinking library budgets, escalating prices of
documents, high level of user expectations,
availability of information resources in diverse
media and so on. IT offers a wide range of
opportunities, which could provide solutions to
some of these major challenges. Rapid
advances in modern technologies have
greatly improved the capabilities of storage,
processing,
retrieval,
repackaging,
communicating, sharing, and managing the
explosive growth of information effectively
and economically in libraries. Use of IT in
libraries has become inevitable in an era of
information explosion and the emergence of a
wide range of new technologies in order to
satisfy the changing complex information
needs of users.
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2003, 23(2)

Libraries have been using IT in general
and computer technology in particular, to
automate a wide range of administrative and
technical processes, build databases,
OPACs, networks and provide better services
to their users. The use of IT for better
management of information in all types of
libraries has grown significantly in recent
years. This widespread use of IT in libraries
has created a profound impact on all aspects
of the present library environment.
Central Universities (CU) are universities
established by Acts of Parliament by
Government of India. They impart education
on a wide range of general, special, technical
and professional disciplines in variety of
courses ranging from Diploma/Degree to
Doctoral level in the country. Libraries form an
important integral part of central university
education system by providing suitable
information material useful for study, teaching,
education, and research purposes. CU
25

libraries in India are actively involved in using
IT to computerise their operations and offer
information services to their users. Therefore,
a study was conducted to survey the use of IT
in CU libraries in India. This paper presents
the analysis of the data gathered through the
survey.
In the survey, the following 16 Central
Universities were considered/chosen from
different parts of the country:

2. LIBRARY COLLECTION
Library
collection
forms
a
sound
foundation for efficient services. The details of
collection of CU libraries are presented in
Table 1. Delhi University Library System
(DULS) is an integrated network of 30
libraries including five divisional libraries, four
faculty libraries, four special libraries, 13
departmental libraries and four zonal libraries,
which are maintained at the expense of UOD.
The Aligarh Muslim University Library System
is a centralised system consisting of a main
library viz. Moulana Azad Library, four college
libraries, 50 department/institutes libraries
and 14 libraries of the halls of residence.
These libraries are simply extensions of the
central library located at different places in the
campus for the convenience of teachers and
students. They function under the full
administrative and technical control of
university library.
As can be seen from the Table 1 that
DULS has the largest collection of 14 lakh
books including back volumes of periodicals
followed by AMU with 9,80,000 books and
BHU with 7,67,383 books. On the other hand,
BBAU has the smallest number of 1000
books. BHU, UOD, UOH, and NEHU have
good collections of more than 3,000 theses in
each library, while JNU has a good collection
of audio visual materials. UOH, IGNOU,
NEHU and TU have also acquired CD-ROM
databases. Regarding back volumes of
periodicals, JNU Library has the largest
number of 1,48,552 volumes followed by BHU
with 1,01,756 and UOH with 69,000 volumes.

3. CURRENT PERIODICALS
In periodicals, DULS subscribes to the
largest number of 3000 current periodicals
followed by BHU with 1,301 and JNU with
1000 periodicals. It is worth noting that TU
has reported having 85 periodicals in floppy
disc and 21 in CD-ROM discs followed by PU
with eight and one respectively.

members working in 14 CU libraries. Out of
14 responded libraries, DULS has the largest
number of 400 staff members followed by
JNU with 160 and NEHU with 85.
Of the 1,214 library staff, there are 12 (1%)
university librarians (ULs), 30 (2.5%) deputy
librarians (DLs), 94 (7.7%) assistant librarians
(ALs) (including documentation officers and
two information scientists), 248 (20.4%)
professional assistants, 415 (34.2%) library
assistants and remaining others 415 (34.2%)
includes
semi-professional
and
other
supporting staff. The data analysis reveals
that the CU libraries are managed by a good
team of professional and non-professional
staff.
The supervisory staff drawing UGC scales
in the cadres of ULs, DLs and ALs constitute
11.2% of total staff. More than half of the
library staff comprising professional assistants
and library assistants belongs to middle level
staff. The remaining one third of staff include
semi-professional and supporting staff.

LIBRARY BUDGET

Finance is the lifeblood of any
organisation. Annual budget is an important
indicator of financial commitment of any
library. CU libraries spend significant amount
Table 5. Library budget (in lakhs)

for acquisition of books, subscription of
periodicals and implementation of IT. The
details of the budget of CU libraries are
presented in Table 5. The table shows that
DULS’s budget for acquisition of books and
periodicals during 1997-98 was four crore
rupees followed by JNU with Rs. 1.38 crores
and UOH with Rs. 1.18 crores.
Nine CU libraries reported IT budget
figures, have spent Rs. 677.87 lakhs for IT
during three years from 1995-96, 1996-97
and 1997-98. PU reported to have spent Rs.
35.6 lakhs for databases during 1995-98.
According to INFLBNET Directory (2000), all
the CU libraries shown in Table 4 were
provided funds except BBAU. In addition,
UGC provided special grants to some CU
libraries. This clearly shows that CU libraries
in general, are spending significant amount
on IT and are using new technologies. The
situation, may further be improved as libraries
are likely to invest more on IT in future.
Further analysis revealed that out of total
amount, a lion’s share has gone for IT
hardware and less amount was spared for
software. IT maintenance and training were
allotted very meager amounts. This confirms
the findings of several earlier studies which

reported that inadequate funds were allocated
for training staff in the use of IT.

7. INFRASTRUCTURAL FACILITIES
The data gathered from questionnaire
responses regarding the infrastructural
facilities available in CU libraries is presented
in Table 6. This table shows that all the 14
(100%) libraries surveyed have telephone, 12
(86%) have xerox and e-mail, seven (50%)
have fax, internet and six (43%) have
scanners. In addition to the items mentioned
in the Table 6, UOH has V-SAT, voice input
devices and film projector, IGNOU has video
conferencing, PU has V-SAT and VB has
telex facilities. Infrastructural facilities form a
sound basis for effective communication both
within and outside the library. Since most of
the CU libraries have the basic infrastructural
facilities, they would facilitate the introduction
and use of IT in these libraries.

8.

AUTOMATION PLANNING

Strategic planning is a key to the
successful library automation implementation.
Therefore, this section is intended to cover
the kind of planning approaches and policy
considerations taken into account by CU

libraries to support the introduction and use of
IT. In order to identify planning approaches to
library automation, the survey included
questions about what are the important
objectives of library automation, who has
participated in planning, what steps they have
taken for implementation and, what are the
important factors considered in choosing a
software. Each of these questions contained
a variable number of choices and the
respondents were asked to prioritise them
beginning with one in the order of importance.
All these numbered responses were totalled
and averaged to get Mean scores. These
scores were used as a basis for assigning
ranks to the choices. The mean score closer
to one is the most important one and the rest
are in the decreasing order of their
importance.

8.1 Library Automation Objectives
In order to identify the goals for library
automation, university librarians were offered
10 choices plus ‘any other’ and asked to
prioritise each choice in the order of their
importance (one is the most important). The
result is presented in Table 7.

The most important objectives of library
automation rated by respondents are: to
improve access to collection, to improve the
quality of existing services and to reduce
routine and time consuming clerical works.
The other objectives are shown in the table
according to their descending order of their
rank. The least regarded objectives are to
improve prestige and visibility of our library
and to reduce the number of staff required. It
clearly shows that libraries are more
concerned to improve user services.
Of all the automation objectives, improving
access to collection received the highest rank
as it is the primary objective of any library.
This confirms the findings of Borgman1 who
surveyed library automation progress in six
Central and Eastern European countries.

8.2 Personnel Involved
The success of library automation largely
depends upon the persons involved in its
planning and implementation. Respondents
were, therefore, asked to rank the persons in
the order of their involvement in automation
planning and implementation process. Table 8
indicates the range of staff involved in the
automation planning and implementation
process. The first position goes to the head of
the library i.e., university librarian, followed by
deputy librarian with second rank and
assistant librarian with third rank. The other

persons participated include information
scientist and other professional staff.

8.3 Steps Taken for Library
Automation Implementation
The basic knowledge of technology is
essential for successful planning and
implementation of library automation. There
are a variety of ways to gain knowledge of
using IT in libraries.
Table 9 shows the steps taken for library
automation implementation. The highly rated
steps are: sending staff for training courses,
visits to automated libraries and consultation
with other librarians. This indicates that
training has been identified as the most
important step as it is a crucial to the
successful library automation implementation.

8.4 Automation Software Selection
Software package play a key role for the
success of library automation. There are a
number of factors, which influence the
selection of a particular package. Table 10
shows the important factors considered in
selecting a library automation software
package.
The first three ranked factors are: software
that is the easiest for library staff and users to
use, supports the cataloging record format
most used in the country, and is in use at
other libraries in the country. The other
reason indicated by one library is that the
software is integrated and comprehensive.
This shows that the user-friendliness has
been accorded as the major factor for
selection of software in CU libraries.

9. CONSTRAINTS IN AUTOMATION
IMPLEMENTATION
Library automation is an expensive,
complex and continuous process involving
various
constraints
faced
in
its
implementation. In order to identify various
constraints faced in library automation
implementation by CU libraries, the
respondents were offered 10 problems plus
‘any other’ and asked to rank each problem in
the order of their severity using one as the
most important. Table 11 indicates the ranked
order of the number of constraints faced in
library automation. The highly ranked
constraints
were
inadequate
financial
resources, lack of well-accepted standard
software package and non-availability of IT
trained personnel. The problem of inadequate
funds has been confirmed in the studies
reported by Burton2, Hauptman and
Anderson 3 and R.P. Kumar4. The least ranked
problem was non-availability of consultancy
services followed by resistance of library staff.

10. TYPE OF HARDWARE IN USE
The number of computers used in a library
serves as an indicator of the level of library
automation implementation. To identify the
types of computers being used by the CU
libraries, the respondents were requested to
indicate the computer facilities available and
also the number of computers used in their
libraries. The data analysis indicates that
most of the respondents except two indicated
using some sort of computers and the result

is presented in Table 12. When these were
analysed according to size, most of CU
libraries are using personal computers (PC)
while mini computer is used only in UOH and
none had main-frame computer.
Regarding the use of PCs, out of 14, the
largest number i.e., 11 (79%) libraries are
found using computers, two are in the
process of procurement and one did not
report the number of computers available in
the library. These 11 libraries have a total of
169 purchase ranging from one to 53 with an

average of 15 PCs per CU library. There are
altogether 30 terminals in five libraries
providing OPAC service. In addition, the table
demonstrates that eight (57%) libraries have
computer network and five (36%) libraries
have CD network too.

11. SOFTWARE IN USE
Another measure of IT utilisation is studied
with respect to application software packages
used in CU libraries. Responses indicate that
13 (93%) libraries use different operating

systems, word processors, application
software and programming languages. The
result of the analysis of responses is
presented in Table 13.
Regarding operating systems, 13 (93%)
libraries are using both MS-DOS and
Windows and nine (64%) are using UNIX.
With regard to word processors, 12 (86%)
libraries use MS-Word, 11 (79%) WordStar,
and five (35%) use Word Perfect.
The application software indicated as
being in use for creating and maintaining
internal databases are dBase III plus,
CDS/ISIS and commercial library software
packages. CDS/ISIS (freely distributed by
UNESCO) is the most widely used software
by many libraries. Almost 12 (86%) libraries
are using CDS/ISIS, eight (57%) LIBSYS (a
commercial software package), five (35%)
dBase III plus/IV and four (28%) libraries use
ILMS/SOUL developed by INFLIBNET of
UGC. This finding confirms the results of the
5
surveys reported by INFLIBNET Centre
6
(2000) and Lakshmana Moorthy . In addition,
DULS uses Troodon and IGNOU uses
Foxplus. Regarding programming languages,

four CU libraries use C, two each Basic and
Pascal.

12. COMPUTERISED LIBRARY
OPERATIONS
The mere availability of IT in a library is
not enough, unless these technologies are
put to use for solving problems of work
environment. In order to obtain a benchmark
on the progress of implementing automated
systems for housekeeping operations, the
survey offered a list of functions and asked
the respondents to mark the computerised
operations in their libraries. Although, the
question asked for a list of operations
currently in use, responses appear to include
planned as well as current operations.
Table 14 shows that the most widely used
library operations reported by 12 (86%)
libraries are word processing followed by 11
(79%) in-house database creation, 10 (71%)
cataloguing and nine (64%) retrospective
conversion, eight (57%) serials control, seven
(50%) acquisition and OPAC. The other
applications in descending order are
budgeting,
management
information,
circulation, and statistical reports. In addition

to these, the other services provided are
publications by DULS, network access by
UOH and indexing and abstracting service by
IGNOU, etc. The data analysis reveals that
the majority of libraries surveyed use IT to
various operations.
Of all the operations, word processing is
widely used in CU libraries. This finding
agrees with Mustafa7 (1985) who made a
study on the use of microcomputers in 114
university libraries in USA.

12.1 Automation Implementation
Regarding the method followed for library
automation implementation, Table 15, shows
that eight (57%) libraries have adopted a
single function approach in a phased manner
in developing their computerised systems and
two
have
stated
for
simultaneous
implementation. Half of the libraries have
integrated all modules of library operations.
Overall it is observed that CU libraries are in
favour of integrated approach in a phased
manner. In the process of automating library
functions, out of four responded libraries,
three have accorded first priority to
cataloguing.

Respondents were asked to indicate the
operations they maintain in parallel both
automated and manual systems, six (43%)
libraries indicated cataloguing and serials
control followed by circulation by five (35%)
and acquisition by four (28%). From this it is
observed that CU libraries will maintain both
manual and automated systems parallelly for
a specified period until the reliability of the
new system is established.

13. DATABASE DEVELOPMENT
Creation of databases of books, serials,
theses is a pre-requisite for online library
operations and networking. As an indicator of
automation, respondents were asked to
indicate the databases they created for public
use such as books, serials, theses along with
the number of records in each database. The
results are presented in Table 16. As can be
seen from the table that many CU libraries
have made considerable progress in
database activity as most of them have
created one or more local databases.
However, databases are not developed
corresponding to their huge volume of
collections.

NEHU initiated library computerisation in
1986 followed by UOH, IGNOU and JNU in
1989. The remaining CU libraries started
computerization after 1995 and made
significant progress during last five years,
which may be more faster in the next couple
of years.
The most remarkable fact is that the UOH
has developed a database for complete
collection over 1,82,000 records of books and
69,000 back volumes of serials followed by
JNU with 95,940 records, DULS with 80,000,
PU with 70,000 and IGNOU with 65,000
records in books database.

14. BIBLIOGRAPHIC STANDARDS
Standardisation is essential in the field of
computersation for compatibility, exchange,
economy in cost, efforts and sharing of
resources. The ISO has brought out some
standards for mechanisation and automation
in documentation. Sharing resources in an
automated environment requires agreement
on standards among the participants
especially for the content and structure of
records to be exchanged or merged.
Exchange of catalogue records is based on

several related international standards for
record description and structure.
Standards for record content and structure
are to be followed for successful development
and use of databases and to facilitate sharing
of resources. To find out the bibliographic
standards
followed
in
CU
libraries,
respondents were offered choice of formats
and asked to indicate the formats used in
their libraries. The result of the analysis of
data is presented in Table 17. From the table,
it is found that eight (57%) libraries are using
CCF, followed by one (7%) each using ISO
2709, MARC, MARC compatible, local format
and LIBSYS format. Regarding sources used
for retrospective conversion of catalogue,
many stated that they have converted their
records by their own staff only and not used
any electronic database sources.
The trend is different in Western countries,
where libraries make maximum use of
external CD-ROM and network databases for
conversion of their records into machine
readable form. The reason for this could be
that the libraries in the West follow standards,
which would facilitate easy downloading of
data.

15. RETROSPECTIVE
CONVERSION OF CATALOGUE

16. COMPUTERISED LIBRARY
INFORMATION SERVICES

In order to know the extent, the library
catalogue were converted into machine
readable form, respondents were offered
choices and asked them to indicate how
much of their catalogue has been converted
into machine readable form. The result is
summarised in Table 18. As can be seen from
the table, that only four libraries have
converted all of their records and the rest are
at various stages of progress.

To measure the degree of automation in
information services, the survey included
questions about the computerised information
services offered by each library. The result is
present in Table 19. This table shows that
seven libraries provide accession list, six
internet service, five each reference service,
and CD-ROM service, four each online
service, ILL, and CAS, etc. The range of
services offered by these libraries varied
between three to seven.

Retrospective conversion of a catalogue is
a complex task which requires not only a lot
of effort and time but also huge financial and
human resources. This is more so with CU
libraries because of their large size holdings.
Therefore, the retrospective conversion of
catalogue work is progressing steadily in CU
libraries.
Respondents were also asked to indicate
which method they followed for retrospective
conversion of their catalogue. As can be seen
from the Table 19 that six libraries have done
with existing staff, two each with temporary
staff and contract basis.

16.1 Databases Used
Databases form sound foundation for
providing efficient information services in a
library. Respondents were asked to indicate
type of databases used in their libraries for
providing information retrieval services to
users. The summary of analysis of databases
used is presented in Table 20. The table
shows that six libraries used inhouse
databases and CD-ROM databases followed
by four libraries using online databases and
three libraries used INFLIBNET databases.

survey has asked to indicate the number of
computers made available to users to use
online catalogues, online and CD-ROM
databases and internet within the library.
Table 21 indicates the availability of
computers and facilities accessible by the
39

end-users. As can be seen from the table that
six libraries have provided computers for end
users. The total number of computers
provided by four libraries is 17 ranging from
two to eight. Regarding facilities accessable
by end-users within the library, five libraries
provide access to OPAC, four each CD-ROM
search service, electronic mail and internet.

about their future plans of using IT in their
libraries. Most of the CU libraries have
indicated their enthusiastic future plans of
using IT extensively for computersiation.
These future plans ranged widely from initial
level of introducing IT, computerisation of one
or more new functions, integration of all
operations, development and participation in
networks and resource sharing and provision
of internet services to the advanced level of
developing digital libraries.

17. NETWORKING AND
RESOURCE SHARING
One of the major objectives of
computerisation is to facilitate networking and
resource sharing. In order to assess the
progress made by CU libraries towards
networking
and
resource
sharing,
respondents were asked to indicate their
accessibility as well as level of participation in
networks.
The Table 22 shows that five libraries have
access to INFLIBNET, four ERNET, three
NICNET, DELNET and INET each. Regarding
participation in networks, seven libraries
participate in LAN while five in MAN.

18. FUTURE PLANS
Finally, the respondents were asked an
open-ended question soliciting the details

CONCLUSION
The survey has provided a useful
summary of current state-of-the art of using IT
in CU libraries in India. The survey confirmed
that IT has deeply embedded in the
management of information in university
libraries. It has become a powerful tool in the
management of routine library operations and
services. The analysis has shown that the use
of technology in CU libraries is increasing
steadily and significantly. The level of
response shown to the present survey
indicated that CU libraries continue to be
more interested in using IT in future. The
respondents clearly indicated an awareness
of current developments concerned with

automated library systems even in those
libraries where IT has not been used much.

to provide need-based, value-added services
to their users.

Use of IT in libraries has become
inevitable in an era of information explosion
and the emergence of a wide range of new
technologies. Effective use of IT in libraries
helps in performing their operations and
services most efficiently. In India, many
libraries have been adopting IT applications to
library operations for providing efficient
services and participating in networks for
sharing resources. Implementation of IT to
library operations is a complex and
continuous process. It requires imaginative,
intelligent planning and huge investment of
financial as well as human resources.
Libraries intending to use IT have to plan
systematically well in advance for successful
implementation to derive maximum benefits
and minimise problems. To keep pace with
the developments, libraries need to re-define
and re-evaluate their roles and make
consistent and systematic efforts to make use
of the new technologies in order to satisfy
variety of complex information needs of users.
The role of the libraries in future would be
heavily involved in adopting modern
technologies and repackaging of information
