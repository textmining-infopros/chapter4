Design and Development of Web-Enabled
Databases in Libraries With Special Reference to
RDBMS: Selection of Tools and Technologies
Ram Kumar Matoria & PK Upadhayay
Abstract
There are a number of ready-made library automation software packages in the
market. However, many of these packages lack web interface and, thus, do not
provide library database access (OPAC, etc.) through web. Moreover, these
commercial packages provide less flexibility to librarians for make desired
changes to the existing databases and to publish the same on the web.
Therefore, designing in-house databases in libraries by using common relational
database tools (RDBMS) like MS Access, SQL, DB2, etc., as back-end solutions
is an area of deep concern.
This paper discusses the merits and demerits of the currently available RDBMS
software for library applications as back-end solutions. The paper also discusses
the various tools/technologies required/available for publishing the library
databases over web. It has also been emphasized to use the technology that is
more user friendly, easy to design, requires less programming skill thus, suitable
for librarians to setup web-enabled solutions in the libraries.

1. INTRODUCTION
Application of computers certainly has
improved the ways in which we acquire,
process, store and disseminate information in
libraries. As a result, we have automated
house-keeping operations, catalogue and,
user services in libraries. Moreover, with the
advancement in the network technology
during last decade, we have started providing
user services through various online modes
viz. e-mail, FTP, Telnet, etc. These
static/interactive modes of data/information
sharing over network have improved the
library services and, their popularity among
the users.
During 1994, libraries began to show their
presence on the internet by setting up their
web sites. In the beginning, libraries built their
web pages by providing mainly static
information. However, in the late 1997,
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(4 & 5)

libraries began re-engineering their web
pages with the intention of providing
information from databases in a dynamic
manner1 . Today the advancements in web
and database technology have enabled the
libraries to share/publish the data/information
directly from the databases over the internet.
Now web has become a dynamic platform for
information delivery over the internet and very
useful for libraries to provide various user
services.
This paper intends to provide an overview
of the database tools available for designing
in-house databases in the libraries as well as
the web technology for publishing such
databases over the web. Besides, the paper
discusses the need of developing in-house
databases in libraries, advantages of
web-enabled databases, and selection of
database tools from RDBMS (relational
9

database management system) commonly
available.

2. IN-HOUSE DATABASES IN
LIBRARIES
There are a number of ready-made library
automation software packages in the market
which can be used to automate the library
functions and user services. However, many
of these packages lack web interface and,
thus, do not provide library database access
(OPAC, etc.) through web. Moreover, these
commercial packages provide less flexibility
to librarians for making desired changes to
the existing databases and to publish the
same on the web.
An in-house designed database system
provides
full
flexibility
to
the
developer/administrator/librarian
and
is
simpler to install, maintain and, use without
having to rely on external support, and also is
highly customizable and can be designed to
meet local needs 2. Librarians can also
participate in design/development process as
now a days easy and user-friendly database
tools are available with in-built web interface.
As per the survey conducted in order to
get a clear understanding of the current role
of library web master, 100 percent of the
respondents felt that librarians should have
some role in web site design and
maintenance 3 .

3. BENEFITS OF WEB-ENABLED
DATABASES
Web-enabled databases have certain
advantages
over
other
means
of
sharing/publishing information over internet.
These
advantages
are
common
to
bibliographic databases also where libraries
can put their OPACs and other databases on
4
web. According to L.J.Haravu ; Kristin
5
6
Aantelman and; Chong Ho Yu , the benefits
of web-enabled databases are as follows:
q Global/wide access to data with a single
user in ter face
q Format independent access of data (text,
graph ics, au dio, video, etc.)

Besides,
Ortiz-Repiso7
and
Norm
8
Medeiros have written excellent papers on
differences between traditional v/s innovative
means (web OPACs) of library catalogs, while
B. Ramesh Babu, et al 9 have presented an
overview of web OPACS with their
advantages in libraries.

4. DATABASE TOOLS
In the early days of database
development, it was the flat-file system to
store data in a single file by using field
separators and record separators. Later, such
flat-file systems were facilitated by an index in
which a single index file stored keywords and
pointers to the records that were stored in
main file. This made retrieval more efficient,
still flat-file systems were seriously inefficient.
It showed data-redundancy, poor data control,
and did not supported complex data types
10
(audio, video, graphics, etc.) .
After 1960s, two database models were
developed in quick succession to solve the
limitations of flat-file systems. These
database models were Hierarchical Database
Model and Network Database Model. The
Hierarchical Database composes of a root
segment, parent segments and child
segments. This model depicts a set of
one-to-many relationships between a parent
and its children. However, this model has
number of limitations. It does not include ad
hoc querying capability and, a multi-parent
relationship is difficult to implement, as in a
many-to-many relationship. The Network
Database Model attempted to deal with many
of the hierarchical model’s limitations. The
network
database
structure
easily
accommodates the multiple child, although,
its structural complexities often limit its
effectiveness and efficiency. Both of these
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 2 2(4 & 5)

database models are obsolete now mainly
because of their incompatibility with web
environment and have been replaced by
RDBMS.
RDBMS
is
the
current
database
implementation standard being used for
publishing information on the web. It includes
the following features which make it suitable
for web environment:
(a) Provide extremely useful tools for database
administration;
(b) Adhere to powerful query language SQL
(structured query language) developed by
Microsoft Corporation;
(c) Compliant with ODBC/JDBC and other
database interface tools;
(d) Work in client/server mode;
(e) Offer distributed database and distributed
processing options; and
(f) Have referential integrity controls to ensure
data consistency and, thus, suitable for web
environment.
It is easier to design applications in
RDBMS due to the following features:
n Requires less programming skill
n Availability of third party tools, and
n Inbuilt web interface.
These all features of RDBMS have made
them ideal for library applications to setup
bibliographic
database
solutions
and
publishing them over the web.
In the early days of library systems
development, vendors have designed library
applications software by using pre-relational
database technology. Still some library
systems suppliers are continuing to maintain
and develop such products. These proprietary
library applications software have their own
advantages and disadvantages. However, in
the
library
management
systems
marketplace, there is a growing trend towards
the use of RDBMS as shown in the figure 1.
and figure 2. (Source: Biblio Tech Review:
Database Updates, 12

As per the Gartner list of database
management systems, there are 140 products
from 67 vendors ranging from pre-relational,

Some of the common RDBMS which can
be used to design in-house databases in
libraries are MS Access, SQL Server, Oracle,
Informix, Sybase, File Maker Pro, SAS, etc.
However, the selection of suitable RDBMS for
library applications depends on the particular
library requirements, kind of applications
(bibliographic/full-text/numeric),
the
application
level
(database
level/data
warehouse level), magnitude of data (number
of records/length of fields), nature of data
analysis (basic statistics, i.e., sum, average,
mean/advance
statistics)
and,
comprehensiveness and inter-operability.
Other points to be considered while selecting
database tools for library applications are
easiness, user-friendliness, flexibility and low
cost.
In most of the cases in libraries where
bibliographic databases are dealt with,
commonly available consumer database
products such as MS Access, and File Maker
Pro are sufficient. These products can support
up to 1GB of data and provide cheaper
solutions. However, these database tools are
suitable for small databases and not useful for
large databases, hence provide limitations in
web environment. There are specific
database solutions for large databases
available from MS SQL Server, DB2, Oracle,
Informix, Sybase, etc. These database tools
support up to several terra byte of data;
permit thousands of simultaneous users; work
in client/server mode; show natural affinity
towards web environment and, thus, suitable
for
large
bibliographic,
web-enabled
12

databases in libraries. However, to design
full-text databases in libraries where large
files are to be stored and retrieved, these
tools do not offer good solutions as most of
these tools support 200-255-400 characters
field length. Although, many of these tools
allow unlimited entries in memo field, the data
inside a memo field are not searchable and
thus, offer limited utility. In this respect, MS
SQL Server has extended the searchable
field length up to 8063 characters and thus,
provide solutions for moderate full-text
databases.
As a common trend , a number of libraries
have been using open source software
available either free or on nominal prices.
These database management systems
include the most common mySQL, mSQL
and, recently updated PostgreSQL. These
database tools are easy to work and run on
various platforms such as UNIX, Lynux, NT,
etc.
Besides, there are some library specific
text retrieval database tools for management
of full-text large files, generally known as
‘Free Form Databases’, provide powerful
search engine. Although, in some ways they
are at the opposite end of the RDBMS, little
database structure imposed on the designer
and, thus, provide an easy and readymade
database structure. However, they provide
some limitations in achieving integration in the
modules other than searching such as
cataloguing,
classification,
management
module, etc. These software are BRS/Search,
Basis Plus, Status, etc.

5. WEB TECHNOLOGY
World Wide Web or WWW or web,
sometimes
wrongly
mentioned
as
synonymous to internet, is a sub-set of it and
is
a
most
promising
mode
of
publishing/sharing of data/information. Now,
the web has emerged as the dominant
protocol over internet due to its special
features like easy interfacing of diverse
platforms/technologies;
provision
to
incorporate text, graphics, audio and video,
etc.; permitting to access data/information in a
non-linear way and; jumping from one
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 2 2(4 & 5)

document/resource to another through
hyperlinks. The superiority of www over other
modes of online sharing viz. e-mail, FTP,
Telnet, Gopher, etc., has been well explained
11
by Paul Scully . In fact, web has provided a
single user interface to facilitate the user
interaction with the databases or systems
resources.

6.1

The web uses unique URL (universal
resource locator) address which facilitates the
access of information seamlessly across the
diverse platforms in a client-server mode. The
actual data represented in a structured way
reside in a powerful computers called server,
while the latter is equipped with server
tools/software to populate the information
over web. The client/user equipped with web
browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer
(MSIE) and Netscape Navigator, etc., which
interact with the server through common
communications protocol TCP/IP over high
speed network/internet. In fact, the client/user
sends its query to the server while the latter
processes the request and gets the
response/results from the database and
sends it back to the client/user over the web.

Web server is the software that helps in
sharing the system resources/files over the
internet through web browsers. The latter
communicate with a web server via the
standard Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol
(HTTP). In fact, web servers receive queries
from the client, process it, get data from
databases and send it back to the client over
web. The popular web servers are Apache,
Microsoft IIS, iPlanet from Sun-Netscape
alliance, and newly developed Zeus from
Zeus Technology Ltd.

6. COMPONENTS OF WEB-BASED
SYSTEMS
Following components are required for
web-based systems (figure 4):

Web Browser

It is a software that helps users to interact
with the server for sending queries and
getting results over the web. MSIE and
Netscape are the most popular web browsers,
both of these are available free.

6.2

Web Server

Although web servers are increasingly
found as components within full-featured
server operating systems, there are some
basic selection points that should be
highlighted. These points are scalability and
performance; high availability and reliability;
interoperability and open standards; system
administration and; security12 . In fact, there
are not much choice in the web server
segments as many of them come along with
database tools, show natural affinity with the
database tools from same vendor, and some

work
better
with
certain
platform/operating systems. According to the
widely followed Netcraft13 (www.netcraft.com/
survey) web survey, approximately 60 percent
of web servers run Apache, with Microsoft’s
IIS and the Netscape/iPlanet web server as
its major competitors. However, Gartner2
studies have given Netscape/iPlanet a larger
share of public web sites, followed by Apache
and Microsoft/IIS. Apache is being used for
the public sites of companies such as Merck,
A merican Express, Texaco, Chrysler, and
others. However, it is easier to find both
Microsoft/IIS and Netscape/iPlanet as the
servers for large corporate public web sites
when using the lookup facility offered by
Netcraft
(www.netcraft.com).
Also,
for
intranets, most counts credit Microsoft/IIS and
Netscape/iPlanet as the leaders, followed by
Apache, IBM’s Lotus Domino Go server, and
others. Among hot e-commerce sites,
E*Trade runs the Netscape/iPlanet server,
eBay runs Windows/IIS, and Amazon runs
Apache (the Apache-based Stronghold
Secure Server), according to the Netcraft web
survey 14.

6.3

Web Authoring Tools

Basic web server software does nothing
except it sends HTML data in response to a
browser request. However, certain other
web-authoring and scripting tools are required
to extend the functionality of web server to
extract the data from databases. These
web-authoring
tools
(HTML
and
its
derivatives; and other Markup languages,
etc.) and scripting tools (Perl, C++, Java
Script, JScript, VBScript, etc.) are required to
write web pages and scripts to interact with
back-end databases. In early days of
web-based applications, CGI (common
gateway interface) programs were used
extensively to extend the server functionality
by allowing web users to interact with the web
server to request specific data from the
databases. Although, writing CGI program is
difficult and requires programming skill,
however, it works with high reliability. Now a
days, a number visual editors are available to
generate the web pages and write scripts
automatically. The common editors are
14

Microsoft Front Page, Visual Interdev,
Netscape Composer, Web Builder, etc.
Besides, other technologies have been
introduced to communicate with the back-end
databases. These technologies are Microsoft
Active Server Pages (ASP ) and Java Server
Pages (JSP) from Sun Micro Systems. Both
the technologies have combined the HTML
codes with the scripts in a single page and
thus, making it easier to interact with
back-end databases.
During last few years, object-oriented and
component based solutions were added to
further make it easier to interact with the
back-end databases. These solutions include
Microsoft COM/DCOM, ActiveX Data Objects
(ADO); OMA and CORBA (Common Objects
Request Broker Architecture) from Object
Management Group; and Sun’s
EJB
(Enterprise Java Beans), Java Applets (for
client) and Java Servlets (for server), etc.
Besides, some database connectivity tools
such as ODBC and JDBC have also emerged
as in-built features of operating systems, etc.

6.4 Free Wizards and Third Party
Tools
Writing HTML codes and scripts for
database interaction is the most difficult part,
requires programming skill, systems logic and
manipulation
planning,
especially
for
non-computer professionals. However, a
number of free wizards and third party tools
are available on internet which can generate
hundred of lines of codes automatically with a
single click, thus, making it easier for
non-skilled users to set up web-enabled
database solutions in libraries.
Some of the free wizards are Rule Zero
(http://www.Rulezero.com), Power ASP (http:
//www.Powerasp.com), Active Server Pages
Tools & Components (http://www.web-savant.
com/users/kathi/asp/tools.html), etc. Besides,
Microsoft FrontPage also provides database
wizard to generate ASP pages/VBScripts
automatically to interact with back-end
databases, while Visual InterDev provides a
visual interface to develop a web-enabled
web site with minimum efforts.

7. CONCLUSION
Now a days, libraries are using web
technology extensively for user services to
provide dynamic services to the remote users.
Web technology currently available is helping
the libraries to achieve their purposes.
Although,
web
technology
available,
especially from Microsoft, is easier to setup
the applications. It requires less programming
skill and, is suitable for librarians. However,
there is a need for librarians to get extensive
exposure
with
the
computer
and
communications technology in general and
web
technology
specifically.
The
advancement
in
database
technology
especially RDBMS has made them ideal for
library applications. These RDBMS provide
simple architecture, easy to design and are
equipped with flexible data exchange
interface and, thus, present ideal solutions for
web-enabled databases in libraries.
