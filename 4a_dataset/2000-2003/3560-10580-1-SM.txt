Application of Growth Models to Science and
Technology Literature in Research Specialities
Praveen Sharma, B.M. Gupta, Suresh Kumar
Abstract
The paper discusses the application of three well-known growth models, namely
exponential, logistic, and power to the growth of world literature in physics,
chemistry, and electrical & electronic engineering research, as reflected in
international databases in these three fields from 1907 to 1994. The growth
models are classified and characterised on the basis of two growth-rate functions
9
as suggested by Egghe and Rao . The methodology suggested by Egghe and
Rao in identifying a growth model has been reviewed with the help of case
studies on the growth of literature in the three major fields. The results obtained
through the analysis are not found to be in full agreement with the results
expected using Egghe & Rao methodology. The present study emphasises the
need to undertake more rigorous research on the time series data on
publications growth of various fields to test the utility of these growth rate
functions.

1. INTRODUCTION
1

Cole and Eales published their first study
in 1917 on the development of comparative
anatomy over three centuries, covering the
period since 1550, with disaggregation of the
data by country and topical sub-area within
the field. They were among the first to utilise
the published literature for constructing the
quantitative profile and indicators of a
research field. This pioneering effort was
subsequently strengthened by two agricultural
2
scientists, Wilson and Fred who published a
study in 1935 of the growth and development
of research activities on the nitrogen fixation
of plants. After a gap of two decades, interest
in quantitative studies of science again
resurged. Derek Solla de Price3 a historian of
science and physicist by training, strongly
advocated the idea that, while we might not
be able to read all the scientific publications
that appear, we might learn something about
science by merely counting them. He actively
suggested studying scientific developments
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(2)

with quantitative methods using demographic
and bibliometric data. Price 4 studied the
growth of physics literature by counting the
number of abstracts in Physics Abstracts from
1900 to 1950. He found that, except for
interruptions during the two world wars,
physics publications have been increasing
exponentially, with a doubling time period of
about 12 years. Along with this, Price also
took different types of statistical data on
science and technology, such as journals,
manpower, expenditure, etc., and has shown
that an exponential growth model fits in all
types of growth of such statistical data.
The proliferation of scientific literature
appearing throughout the world has quite
naturally promoted a truism on the part of
observers and specialists, that the escalation
in growth of scientific literature could not
follow an exponential function indefinitely.
This very high level that has been reached for
sometime led them to think that inevitable
slow down would take a form of logistic curve
17

at some point of time in the growth of a
research field.
The pioneering efforts of Price’s work
brought
legitimacy
to
the
scholarly
examination of the literature of specialities,
partly because his conclusions conceded
with, and indeed reinforced, the widely held
belief that the proliferation of science
seemingly knew no bounds. In recent years,
studies of emerging fields of science and
technology, using bibliometric data, have fairly
become common. The nature of this research
is quite diverse and there is no single
research method that has come to the
forefront. However, in general, there are two
basic approaches. The first approach derived
from the works of Price and few other
scholars, seeks to model the growth of a
research field by measuring its annual growth
of publications and authors. The second
approach is quite different, in that it uses the
citation as a unit of analysis. Citation-based
studies seek to understand the interlocking
nature of citation patterns as a means of
observing the growth and development of
clusters of scholars who may ultimately come
to form the basis of a new field. Several
scholars undertake both type of studies, the
attention to the latter has been increasing
more recently in the field.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Many scholars have studied the
application of selected growth models to the
literature growth in research specialities. May 5
explored the growth of mathematical literature
since 1868. He found that the number of
mathematics publications per year (measured
by the counts of titles abstracted) has grown
from 800 to 13000, at an average compound
interest of about 2.5% per year, doubling
about four times a century. Similarly, he
found that cumulated growth of mathematics
titles grew from 41,000 in 1867 to 41,900 by
the end of 1965, and followed an exponential
model, with few deviations only during world
wars.
Jean Tague6, et al studied the
application of linear, exponential, and logistic
models in the growth of literature as listed and
covered in indexing and abstracting services
in science and technology and social
18

7

sciences. Efthomidis analysed the growth of
OPAC literature from 1970 to 1985, and
showed that it could be a good example of
logistic growth. Wolfram8 et al tried linear,
exponential and power models to the growth
of 20 years publications in several databases
belonging to science and technology, social
sciences and humanities. According to them,
the popular models of exponential growth is
no longer appropriate to represent literature
growth of last twenty years. Instead, linear
and power model performed quite well in such
literature growth. The latter growth model, in
particular was found to perform best, because
it has the advantage of modeling the growth
behavior of both linear and exponential
models. Egghe and Rao9 went a step further
and reanalysed the Wolfram data and
explored the applications of few growth
models in all the data sets of Wolfram and
observed that the power model explains very
well the growth of science and technology
literature. The Gompertz model, on the other
hand, explains very well the growth of social
sciences literature. They suggested a novel
method of classifying various growth models,
on the basis of two new growth rate functions,
which also provided a clue in the selection of
growth model, which might fit in any given
observed data.

3. CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF
MODELS
Once we have broadly defined the nature
of growth models available in the literature,
the next question arises as how to identify a
particular model or models that may possibly
fit in a given growth data of a discipline or
speciality. Egghe and Rao 9 have suggested a
methodology by which one can get a clue in
this direction. They have defined two new
growth rate functions. These two functions
are defined as:
α 1 (t) = f(t+1)/f(t)
α 2 (t) = f(2t)/f(t)

for t = 1,2,3,4...

α 1 (t) or α 1 is the first growth rate function
and α 2 is the second growth rate function.
The function α2 in fact compares the growth
after double time period (from t to 2t). The
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22 (2)

relation between α 1 and α2 is given by the
following equation:
α 2 (t) =α1 (2t-1) α1 (2t-2).. α 1 (t)…..
If there were in total N observations (i.e.
t=0, 1, 2, N-1), there would be N-1 values for
9
α 1 and N/2 values for α2. Egghe and Rao
have also derived and plotted graphs of α 1
and α2 for the following growth models:
exponential, logistic, power, Ware, and
Gompertz. They have also given plots of α 1
and α2 of the various models in terms of the
following classification: (1) increasing, (2)
constant, (3) decreasing, (4) increasing and
then decreasing.
Using the criteria suggested above and the
trends obtained through plotting the first
growth rate functions of the observed data
sets, we have selected three models, namely
exponential, logistics, and power model for
our analysis and studied their application in
the growth of world research papers in
physics, chemistry and electrical & electronics
engineering.

4. NATURE OF GROWTH MODELS
Many scholars have tried to fit different
type of growth curves to data on publications
and authors. Few models, which are likely to
fit in the observed data and their
characteristics, are briefly introduced as
follows:

4.1

Exponential Growth Model

Exponential growth represents an increase
with a fixed proportion of total population for
each unit of time, expressed in percentages
or doubling time. It also assumes a constant
growth rate. Mathematically this function is
represented
as
follows.
A
graphical
representation of this function is given in
figure 1 (Figures 1 to 5 are taken from source:
Egghe, L & Ravichandra Rao, I.K.
Classification
of
growth
models
Scientometrics, 1992, 25 , 5-46).

Figure 1. Exponential growth
t = 0. The constant growth rate from time t to
t+1 is e a1 .

4.2

Logistic Growth Model

Logistic growth assumes that the growth
rate is proportional to the product of present
size and future growth. This cumulative curve
takes a S-shaped pattern. Compared to the
exponential growth, here an upper limit to the
growth curve exists. It follows a slow
inception, followed by steep growth and then
a
long
period
of
saturation.
The
non-cumulative curve shape is symmetrical
about its point of infection. A graphical
representation of this function is given in
figure 2. Mathematically this function is
represented by the following equations:
a1 t

f(t)=F/[1+{F/f(0)-1}e

]

Where F is an upper limit or asymptotic
value to the growth curve and a 1 > 0.
The differential equation for the above can
be written as:
df(t)/dt = a1 [1 – f(t)/F ]*. f(t)

-a1t

f(t)= a2 * e
(Note: a1 is written as a1 also)
df(t)/dt = a 1 * f(t)
where f(t) is cumulated publications at time
t and a1 >0 is a constant. The term a 2
represents number of publications at time
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22(2)

19

4.3

Power Model

This model is represented by the equation:
f(t) = a 0 + al * t a2 (Note: a 2 is written as a2 also)
Where a 0, a 1 > 0. The parameter a 2
defines the shape of the curve. Three
different types of curves are formed
depending on the following values of a2:
For 0 < a 2 < 1, the curve is concave,
For a2 = 1, the curve is linear,
For a2 >1, the curve is convex.
A graphical presentation of this function is
given in figures 3 to 5. The differential
equation for the power model is:
df(t)/dt = [(a2/t) * f(t)] – (a0 * a2 )/t

5. DATABASES AND
METHODOLOGY USED
For studying the growth of publications in
a discipline, the sources normally used for
getting data are printed bibliographies,
indexing and abstracting services, and
computerised
databases
(available
in
CD-ROM media). There are, however, few
sources available, which have a long history
of coverage of developments of a particular
discipline or speciality.
It is necessary to have a long time series
data on the growth of development of
research field to study the application of
growth models in their growth data effectively.
Keeping this in mind, we have selected the
following three research fields for analysis:
(a) Physics research output as reflected in
Physics Abstracts, from 1907 to 1994
(referred as Phy or Physics).
(b) Chemical sciences research output as
reflected in Chemical Abstracts, from
1907 to 1994 (referred as Chem or
Chemistry) and
(c) Electrical & Electronic Engineering
research output as reflected in Electrical
and Electronic Abstracts, from 1907 to
1994 (referred as Engg or Engineering).
Few characteristics of these source
databases are given in Table 1. The
methodology used in the paper is described in
the following steps:
(a) The two growth rate functions have been
calculated from the annual growth data of
publications of the three research fields
under consideration.
(b) The growth rate functions are derived,
plotted and matched with the growth rate
functions of the known growth models.
The nature of growth model, which
possibly may fit in the cumulative growth
data on publications of the three research
fields, is identified.
(c) The actual fitting of the different growth
models is explored in the cumulative
growth data of publications for the three
research fields.
(d) The fitting of the specific growth models is
matched with the results suggested by
growth rate functions. To what extent there
are similarities or dissimilarities in the two
approaches are then discussed.

7. DISCUSSION AND RESULTS
When the first growth rate function α1 was
plotted for the physics, chemistry, and
electrical & electronics engineering data files
(figure 15 to 17), it showed a decreasing trend
for all three data files, giving an indication that
power or logistic model may fit to the data.
The plots of second growth rate function α 2
(figure 18 to 20) showed an increasing trend
for all three cases, indicating that either of the
two models namely exponential or power
model (a2 > 1, a0 > 0) may fit to the data. No
combination of α1 and α2 from the list given
in the paper could be matched to the
corresponding model. Since α1 is decreasing
in all cases and α2 is increasing in all of them,
the power model with parameters a0 > 0, 0
< a2 <1 should be the preferred one if one
goes by growth rate formulations. But in the
present case, the selected (power) model
gave a2 > 1 and not a2 < 1.

The coefficient of determination R2 of most
model fits is comparable for Physics,
Engineering and Chemistry. Exponential
model gives slightly better fit. The results
obtained in terms of fit statistics from the
application of the three models in physics
data file indicate that logistic model

(R2=0.999), power model (R 2=0.997), and
2
exponential model (R =0.994) have all shown
the good fits in the data.
The good
performance obtained in case of power model
is in full agreement with the indications or
clues given by both growth rate functions.
However, it is quite difficult to say why the
logistic model (where only the first growth rate
function has given a clue) given best
24

performance and the exponential also shown
good performance (where the second growth
rate function has given an indication). This is
in partial agreement with the suggested
indicators given by growth rate functions.
According to the results obtained in terms
of fit statistics from the application of the three
models in chemistry data file, exponential
model (R 2 =0.996) is observed to fit best to the
data file. The good performance obtained in
case of exponential model is in agreement
with the indications obtained through the only
second growth rate function α2.
As can be seen from the results of fit
statistics of the three models in engineering
data file, the power model (R 2=0.999) and
logistic model (R2=0.999) are observed to fit
best in the data file. The results obtained in
case of power model are in full agreement
with the indications (given by both growth rate
functions). In case of logistic model, the
results are in partial agreement with the
indications given (by only first growth rate
function α1 ) .

8. CONCLUSIONS
According to Egghe and Rao, the two
growth rate functions α1 and α 2 proposed by
them should give sufficient indication of the
type of model which should fit best in a given
data set. It is also implied that the best model
that fits to a given data will be that model
where both the growth rate functions indicate
the same model selection. In our analysis,
where we have applied three models, namely
exponential, logistic and power models, the
following conclusions are made:
(i) The power model fits best to all three data
files. This is in full agreement with the best
model suggested by both the growth rate
functions but for α 2(t) the trend is not
increasing and then decreasing. We have
a decreasing trend of α2(t) for all three data
files which suggests power model with
a2 <1 but we obtained a 2 >1 in all three data
files when power model was applied;
(ii) All three models fit well to the Engineering
data file. These results are in full
agreement in case of power model and in
partial agreement in case of logistic model;
and
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 2002, 22 (2)

(iii) Power and the exponential model fit best in
the chemistry data file. This is in partial
agreement with the best model suggested
by the growth rate functions.
Based on the analysis and observations
made, it can be concluded that the results
obtained in our analysis are not found to be in
full agreement with the expected results,
which should come through the methodology
suggested, by Egghe and Rao. We therefore
suggest that a more rigorous research on
growth of publications of different research
fields should be carried out to test the utility of
these two growth rate functions in selecting
the right growth model which may best fit in a
given data.
