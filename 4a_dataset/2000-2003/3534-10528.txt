Use of IT in University of Agricultural Science Libraries
of Karnataka: A Comparative Study
B.U. Kannappanavar & Vijayakumar M.

Abstract
The paper highlights the use of hardware and software facilities in University of
Agricultural Science Libraries in Karnataka. It also highlights the access of networks,
information services and barriers in infoimation technology (IT)'applications. A
survey conducted on two agricultural universities tibraries in Karnataka, namely
University of Agricultural Science Library, Dharwar and University of Agricultural
Science Library, Bangalore found that none of the University libraries under the
study i s having databases and full implementation of IT applications in their libraries.

1. INTRODUCTION

2. ANALYSES

With the recognition of the impact of
information technology (IT) in library and
information science (LIS) in providing faster
access to the global information, the libraries in
academic institutions are much interacting with
IT. However, it has not developed its roots well
in the developing countries like India.
Particularly, in Karnataka, it is still in developing
process in agricultural universities. To collect the
required data for this study, a aurvey was
conducted on two agricultural universities
libraries in Karnataka, namely, University of
~ ~ r i c u l t u r aScience
l
Library (UASL), Dharwar
and University of Agricultural Science Library
(UASL), Bangalore. The analyses of the survey
are provided here.

2.1

Collection

Major share of the collections of .the
agricultural university libraries in Karnataka have
been in the form of books. On the other hand,
journals and non-book materials have occupied
the second and third position respectivel*!. Only
UASL, Bangalore, is having audio/visual material
(Table 7).

To derive the benefits arising through the
appJjcations of IT, most of the librariesand

varied types of computers and communication

requirements to respond quickly and to
disseminate the information to the users. The
list of hardware installed at the agricultural
university libraries of Karnataka is provided in
the Table 2.
It can be ascertained from Table 2 that both
the agricultural university libraries of Karnataka
under the study have installed microcomputers
having floppy drives and CD-ROM drives. No
libraries under the study have local area
networks (LAN) facilities and online access
facilities.

establishment into activation, proper software
facilities are required by the universitylibraries
to serve uptodate information to the clientele.
Tabie 3 provides the software used by the two
libraries. (t can be noted that none of the
libraries is having Pbrary software packages.
These libraries are having DOS and Windows
as operating systems. For development 'of
databases for their library activities, certainly
they require library software packages, either
CDS/ISIS or LIBSYS or others to satisfy the
information needs of academicians, which is
not available at present in these libraries.

Library Services

The agricultural university libraries are
considered as the setvice agencies to the
academic and scientific community as well as
to the fanners. The faculty, scholars, students
and the agriculturists have been served with
different services in their libraries through
manual and cornputerised information retrieval

Network Access

Table 7 provides the information about the
names of networks at national and international
to which the University libraries have access to.
It can be noted from the Table 6 that, only
UASL, Dharwar, has access to agriculture
research information system (ARIS) and
Internet, whereas UASL, Bangalore does not
have any access to networks as such.

Administrative Activities

libraries under the study has used computer

Based on the observation of the study, a few
points are suggested to improve the IT

application
information services to the users in the
agricultural university librades in Karnataka.

J

n

Audio-visual and non-print collections are in
very low proportion. Hence, the UGC which
is a major funding agency, should insist the
libraries to develop such collection by
allotting special grants for the same.

n

Though the agricultural university libraries of
Karnataka have hardwarp and software
facilities to some extent, but the results are
not reaching the users community to the
expected extent. This might be due to lack
of trained manpower and unawareness of
the INFLIBNET programmes. Now-adays,
INFLIBNET is providing a substantial grant to
u n k s i t y libraries for their automation. To
overcome this, librarians must approach
INFLlSNff for grants for their library
automation, and the library personnel at all
level should be trained in IT applications.

inadequate trained staff in IT applications, lack
of support from the authorities, lack of IT
knowledge on the part of users and annual
maintenance cost of IT equipment and products
affect the collection development 'and are the
barriers for IT application.

Impact of IT Application

Table 10 presents the impact of IT
applications on libraries. A total of six variables
have been identified and librarians are asked to
give their opinion on these variables. Both the
librarians expressed that the variables like
improvement in the quality of library service,
and efficiency of the library can be done when
it is used in the libraries. It makes integration
within the organisation, improves the
communication, helps in effective resource
sharing, aqd attracts the library users.

4. CONCLUSION
Though the programmes have been meant
for serving the information needs of
academicians, the outputs have not yet reached
the academic community due to non-access of
the INFCIBNET programmes. Apart from this,
there are many network facilities available at
national and International levels, which are not
