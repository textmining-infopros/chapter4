INTRODUCTION

Biotechnology comprises any technology
that uses living entities, in particular animals,
plants or microorganisms. According to the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) biotechnology includes
any technique that uses living organisms
(or parts of organisms) to make or modify
products, to improve plants or animals, or
to develop microorganisms for specific uses1.
The biotechnological inventions can be
classified broadly into the following categories:
(a) inventions relating to an organism or
material such as living entities of natural or
artificial origin (animals, plants, and
microorganisms), biological material (plasmids,
viruses and replicas, and parts of organs,
tissues, cells, and organelles), and naturally
occurring substances from living entities,
biological material and parts thereof;
(b) inventions relating to the process for the

creation of a living organism or production of
other biological materials; and (c) inventions
relating to the use of such organisms or
biological materials. Figure 1 illustrates the
domain of biotechnological research and its
application areas.
Biotechnology in industry mainly comprises
chemical or pharmaceutical substances or
processes pertaining to the plant and animal
kingdom. Its pharmaceutical applications include
production of regulatory protein, blood products,
vaccines, antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies,
and DNA hybridisation probes. Biotechnology
has contributed to the diagnosis, prevention
and control of animal diseases, animal nutrition
and growth promotion, and genetic improvement
of animal breeds. In plant kingdom, it has
led to the improvement of specific plant species,
and use of microorganisms for crop improvement.
Its aquaculture applications include use of
marine microorganisms with unusual capabilities,
fish culturing, and prevention and control of

fish diseases. Environmental applications of
biotechnology include pollution control and
toxic waste treatment, microbial mining and
microbial enhanced oil recovery. In electronics,
biotechnology has led to bioelectronics, e.g.,
biosensors and biochips.
Genetic engineering has emerged as
the most important areas of research.
Essentially, it is only one possible method,
for artificial modification of the hereditary
material of animals, plants, and microorganisms.
It makes the practical use of the fact that
genetic make up of all living things, from the
most primitive viruses through the entire plant
and animal kingdom to mankind, is determined
by the sequence in which just four nucleic
acids are arranged in their DNA. Today, molecular
biologists can not only identify these sequences
and decipher (determine) their biological function,
but also intervene to modify or clone one
genotype, isolate individual genes and also
transfer them to bioreactors. Many biotech
patents are directed to specific proteins and
the DNA that codes for the protein. Important
breakthroughs have happened in genetic
engineering with some of them being granted
patents also2,3 . A few of these have been
elicited below:


32

Genetically engineered bacterium capable
of breaking down multiple components

of crude oil. This bacterium was granted
patent by the United State Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) in 1980. This
invention had 36 claims.


Cloned sheep (Dolly).



Genetic modification of mouse to make
it susceptible to breast cancer and, therefore,
particularly suitable for testing cancer
drugs. The invention was granted US
patent (4,736,866) in 1988 to Leder and
Stewart of Harvard College. This patent
had 12 claims and was licensed to DuPont.



Tracy, a sheep whose germ line contains
a genetic construction comprising a human
gene plus ‘promoter’. Tracy’s milk glands
produce proteins identical to human ones,
which can then be removed from the
milk by using known processes. Proteins
that can be extracted are human insulin,
tissue plasminogen activator and alpha
antitrypsin—a very important drug for
treating mucoviscidosis (severe lung function
impairment).



Control of plant gene expression. A broad
patent (55 claims) covering genetically
modified plant was granted US patent
(5,723,765) in 1988 to the US inventors.
Essentially, this is a method of creating
transgenic plants wherein expression of
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(6)

certain plant traits could be externally
controlled.




Concentrated stem cells, which are
undifferentiated or partially differentiated
cells, which can be developed into a
number of other cell types, have been
patented in the US.



Partial gene sequences including ‘expressed
sequence tags’ (EST’s), which are
components of genes being expressed
at a particular time, can now be sequenced
by machine.

PATENTING OF BIOTECHNOLOGICAL INVENTIONS

Some of the biotechnological domains
being patented today are: genetic engineering
process; method of producing organisms;
method of isolation of microorganisms from
culture medium; method of mutation; biologically
pure cultures; mixed cultures; Eukaryotic
cells; tissue or organ cultures; mutants;
transformants; plasmids; process for making
monoclonal antibodies; and cell lines for
making monoclonal antibodies. However,
patenting has also raised important issues.
For example:



The transgenic research mouse designed
as a laboratory model for cancer studies
at Harvard under NIH funding was patented,
and licensed to DuPont, which further
sought strong controls over it and other
forms of modified mice.

Corn, alfa-alfa, radicchio, cotton seed,
soyabean, tomato are some of the common
food
items
that
have
been
genetically modified.

Strong intellectual property rights (IPRS)
in biotechnology are of critical importance
for the continuous growth of the biotechnology
industry. Significant investment in the
biotechnology has been attributable to the
patenting system which first officially started
to allow patents for living matter such as
microorganisms in 1980 [Diamond vs Chakrabarty
(1980) 26 USPQ 193 changed the direction
of patent laws in the US by holding claim
to a bacterium valid. In essence, Chakrabarty
developed a genetically engineered bacterium
capable of breaking down multiple components
of crude oil]. Biotechnology has emerged as
one of the most important domain of patenting.
It is also one of the most important area of
conflict between developing and developed
economies.





A number of very basic inventions,
fundamental methods, research techniques
and tools significant for product development,
have been made and granted patents 4 .
In many cases, there were initial doubt
about patentability, but the doubts have
regularly been resolved in favour of
patentability [at least by the US Patent
and Trademark Office (USPTO)].

DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(6)

Private firms are filing patent applications
for newly identified DNA sequences including
gene fragments before identifying a corresponding
gene, protein, biological function or potential
commercial product. The patents on isolated
gene fragments can block foreseeable
commercial products such as therapeutic
proteins or genetic diagnostic tests that will
be more likely to be required for the use of
multiple fragments. Receptors are useful for
screening potential pharmaceutical products.
As receptors are being granted patents, it
makes it difficult to understand the therapeutic
and side effects of potential products at the
preclinical stages. Similarly, promoters are
inserted into plants along with the new substantive
genes and that encourage the plant to express
these substantive genes.
There is also the issue of overlapping
patents. For example, claims covering the
use of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
maize—maize that contains a gene from a
bacterium that kills insects—have been awarded
to the (a) first firm to clone the Bt gene, (b)
to the first firm to put it in any plant, and
(c) to the first firm to put it in a crop plant.
Microbiological inventions include new
products, processes, uses and compositions
involving biological materials. These inventions
cover methods to isolate and obtain new
organisms, improve their character, modify
them and find their new and improved uses.
33

Patenting of new microorganisms is based
on their differences with the characters and
uses. Known microorganisms are restricted
to new uses wherever patent laws permit
such protection. The same is the case with
genetically modified microorganisms. Genes
and gene products are treated similarly to
chemical compositions. Patenting of animal
and human genes quite often attracts issues
regarding public order and morality.

2.1 Conditions of Patentability for
Biotechnological Inventions
Usually, to be patentable, patent laws
require a new invention to comprise an inventive
step and industrial applicability. Also, inventions
must be repeatable. Disclosure under the
patent system must enable others to repeat
the technical solution described in the patent.
Determination of what has been specified
(claimed) in the invention and whether
specifications and claims disclose a credible
utility for the claimed invention is a guiding
principle. If no credibility has been asserted
(disclosed) and any utility is readily apparent
to one of normal skill, the application should
normally be rejected.
The examiner determines whether asserted
utility (by the applicant) is specific and substantial,
and if so, determines whether such asserted
utility is credible. In determining credibility,
the examiner should consider whether or
not there are similar or equivalent materials
and/or procedures available for achieving that
utility. However, distinction between ‘discovery’
and ‘invention’ is difficult to make in the field
of biotechnology. It is also not clear how
‘microbiological’ processes differ from ‘essentially
biological’ ones. Article 28.2 of TRIPS extends
the rights of process patentees to the product
directly obtained from the patented process.
It is not clear however, if patented microbiological
processes would give their owners productpatent-like rights over the products produced
directly with the use of these processes.
New microorganisms isolated for the first
time from the natural surrounding can only
be patented if they differ in character from
the known microorganisms and have a new
or improved use or function. Claims to
34

microorganisms have been allowed on the
grounds that they are the products of
microbiological processes.
Standards of novelty and non-obviousness
are difficult to set for living organisms. Most
developed countries now recognise that novelty
is met if the claimed biotechnological product
or process does not exist in the prior art.
Sufficiency of disclosure is met for
microorganisms by depositing microorganisms
in any of the internationally rcognised depository
under the Budapest Treaty.
Article 27(2) of the TRIPS Agreement
has excluded certain inventions from the
patentability on the ground of morality. These
include protection to human, animal or plant
life or health or to avoid serious prejudice
to the environment provided that such exclusion
is not made merely because exploitation is
prohibited by domestic laws. Provisions of
Article 27(3) of the TRIPS Agreement further
allows members to exclude from patentability
diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical methods
for the treatment of human or animals, plants,
and essential biological processes for the
production of plants and animals. However,
members must provide opportunity for patenting
of microorganism and non-biological and
microbiological processes. Therefore,
microorganisms are patentable with regard
to process of their production and use.

2.2 Patenting of Biotechnological
Inventions in the Indian Patents
Act
The Indian Patents (Amendment) Act
2005 has specified [under Section 3(a) to
3(j)] inventions that will not be considered
as a patentable subject matter in India 5 .
Two of the Clauses 3(c) and 3(j) are important
in the context of patentability of biotechnological
inventions. Clause 3(c) states that “The mere
discovery of a scientific principle or the formulation
of an abstract theory or discovery of any
living thing or nonliving substances occurring
in nature” will not be considered as patentable
invention. This provision of non-patentability
is common to patent laws of other countries.
The Clause 3(j) states “plants and animals
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(6)

in whole or any part thereof other than
microorganisms but including seeds, varieties
and species and essentially biological processes
for production or propagation of plants and
animals as non-patentable invention”. This
provision differs from the patent laws of countries
like the US, the European Union, and Japan
who follow liberal patent standards and where
patents are also granted to genetically modified
animals and plant varieties. This exception
of non-patentability is allowed as per TRIPS
Agreement provided member countries provide
alternate effective system for protection of
plant varieties patentable subject matter in
India 5. Two of the Clauses 3(c) and 3(j) are
important in the context of patentability of
biotechnological inventions. Clause 3 (c) states
that “The mere discovery of a scientific principle
or the formulation of an abstract theory or
discovery of any living thing or nonliving
substances occurring in nature will not be
considered as patentable invention”. This
provision of non-patentability is common to
patent laws of other countries. The Clause
3(j) states that “Plants and animals in whole
or any part thereof other than microorganisms
including seeds, varieties and species and
essential biological processes for production
or propagation of plants and animals as
non-patentable invention”. This provision differs
from the patent laws of countries like the
US, the European Union, and Japan, who
follow liberal patent standards and where
patents are also granted to genetically modified
animals and plant varieties. This exception
of non-patentability is allowed as per TRIPS
Agreement provided member countries provide
alternate effective system for protection of
plant varieties (sui generis system). The
above provisions clearly identify microorganisms
as patentable subject matter and are in
compliance with the TRIPS requirement.

3.

METHODS OF CONFERRING
IPRS TO PLANT MATERIALS

Some of the methods for conferring IPRS
to plant materials are:


The US model of plant patents, which
is distinct from the normal (utility) patents.

DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(6)



Through allowing normal patents on plants
or parts thereof, such as cells.



Through applying a sui generis form of
plant variety protection (PVP).



International Union for the Protection of
Plant Variety style legislation based on
the 1978 or 1991 Convention.



Through allowing patents on DNA sequences
and gene constructs (including the gene),
plants transformed with these constructs,
the seeds and progeny of these plants.

Apart from the use of patents and PVP,
the intellectual property (IP) in plants can
be appropriated by technological means. For
instance, crops such as commercial hybrid
maize cannot be reused if hybrid yield and
vigour have to be maintained. Genetic Use
Restriction Technologies (GURTs) is a term
used to describe different forms of controlling
the action of genes in plants. The so called
‘terminator technology’, which renders the
seed sterile so that it is physically not possible
to grow a second crop, is well known but
other characteristics can also be controlled,
either for agronomic or commercial reasons.
Patents are the strongest form of IP
protection as they normally allow the rights
holder to exert the greatest control over the
use of patented material by limiting the rights
of farmers to sell or reuse seed they have
grown or other breeders to use the seed (or
patented intermediate technologies) for further
research and breeding purposes. For example,
the patent on plant gene expression has
wide control of controlling gene expressions
in plants. However, patent laws can provide
exceptions such as farmer’s exception on
genetic material or compulsory licensing.
Under PVP a lower standard is used 6 .
The variety has to be (i) ‘new’, i.e., never
sold prior to the date of application or priority
date, (ii) ‘distinct’, i.e., clearly distinguishable
from previously known varieties, (iii) ‘uniform’
where the variations in the variety can be
described and predicted and are commercially
acceptable, and finally (iv) ‘stable’, i.e., the
35

variety must be capable of being reproduced
with the same essential and distinctive
characteristics with a reasonable degree of
certainty. Mere discoveries of plants growing
in the wild is protectable provided other criteria
are met. Thus, PVP laws allow breeders to
protect varieties with similar characteristics.

compositions; macromolecular compounds;
and biocide and plant reproduction techniques.
Table 2 highlights patenting activity in
biotechnology in three sub-periods (199094; 1995-98; 1999-2002). Steady increase
in patenting activities in biotechnology can
be observed from the Table 2.

India has rightly opted for PVP through
PVP legislation 2002. It has further specified
a Clause [39(1) (iv)] that states: “A farmer
shall be deemed to be entitled to save, use,
sow, re-sow, exchange, share or sell his
farm produce including seed of variety protected
under this Act in the same manner as he
was entitled to before the coming into force
of this Act and provided that farmer shall not
be entitled to sell branded seed of a variety
protected under this Act”.

Analyses of Indian patenting activity during
2003-04 again shows that in this period also,
pharmaceutical and chemical sectors were
the dominant areas of patenting activity.
Pharmaceuticals had 213 patents (46 per
cent of total patents) during these two years
while chemical sector had 125 patents (27
per cent of total patents). Biotechnology
sector was also well addressed with 48 patents
granted during this period. Other major sectors
contributed insignificant number of patents.

4.1 Indian Patenting Trend
Patents granted to Indian organisations
during 1990-2002 in different sectors are given
in Table 1. It can be observed from Table 1
that chemicals and pharmaceuticals were
the major areas in which Indian organisations
had obtained patents. However, it can also
be observed that Indian organisations also
got patents in biotechnology. Majority of these
were overlapping patents addressing other
sectors (mainly pharmaceuticals). The main
technological domains of patenting activity
in biotechnology were in microorganism

The US, Japan and the European Patent
Office are the three major patent offices
where international firms file patents. However,
in the context of biotechnological inventions,
the USPTO has a long tradition of firms
filing their patents therein because of a number
of factors such as emergence of firms from
the universities, venture capital investments,
and landmark rulings. Thus, by observing
patents granted by the USPTO, a good estimate
of patenting activity in biotechnology can be
obtained. Figure 2 shows patenting activity
in the USPTO by some developed and developing
countries during 1972 to 2006. Differential
scale has been used to properly distinguish
countries that are intensively patenting from
the other with lower patenting intensity. Left
scale depicts the patents granted to India,
China, Brazil, Korea, Russia and Italy. Right
scale depicts the patents granted to the
US, Canada, Great Britain, Japan, Germany,
and France.

Figure 2. Patenting trends in biotechnology by different countries in the
USPTO during 1972-2006.

Figure 2 clearly depicts the US dominance
in patenting in biotechnology. Japan is the
second most prolific country being granted
patent in this area by the USPTO (however,
a steady decline has been observed from
1992 onwards). Among emerging economies,
India shows significant patenting in 200206. Patents granted by the USPTO in
biotechnology in comparison to other sectors
to some developed and developing economies
have been illustrated in Table 3.
Table 3 shows that patents granted to
biotechnology inventions are relatively less
than other sectors. However, they do contribute
to substantial patents in the overall profile
of developed economies. Firms in developing
countries have dominated innovation in
biotechnology with extensive patenting, but
the US has clearly dominated patenting covering
different application areas of biotechnology.
These innovations have high degree of science
linkages and joint partnership between industry
and university.
The patenting activity exhibited by India
in this sector is a positive sign of innovation
activities taking place. It can be observed
that India has shown higher degree of patenting
in biotechnology than China and Brazil. Figure
3 shows that microorganisms or enzymescompositions, thereof, and measuring and
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(6)

testing processes involving enzymes or
microorganisms were the major technological
areas where patenting activities were intensively
undertaken within the biotechnology. These
areas show significant increase in activity
over the years. Another domain of patenting
attention was in fermentation.

5.

CONCLUSION

The study examined the field of
biotechnology and identified some of the
important areas in the context of patentability
in this field. The article underscores the fact
that patenting in biotechnology gives rise to
complex issues as it involves patenting of
living organisms, and how Indian patent provisions
address the issue of patentability in this
subject domain without violating the TRIPS
Agreement.
The study shows that Indian firms have
been able to obtain a number of patents in
biotechnology during 1990-2004 by the US
and Indian patent offices, particularly in the
later period. International comparison of patenting
trends in the USPTO in this area highlights
Indian organisations having higher share then
other emerging economies. However, relative
to technologically developed economies Indian
activity is still insignificant.
