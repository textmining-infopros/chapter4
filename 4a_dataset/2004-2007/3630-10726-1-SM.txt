Free Information Sources and Services on Internet 
for Libraries: A Selective Compilation 
Subhash Khode & Divik Kumar 
Abstract 
Over the last few years, internet has revolutionised the ways by which librarians can provide information sources and services to their users. This paper describes how with the help of internet, librarians provide access to the various types of online information sources and services to their users, which are freely available on internet including e-journals, e-books, online databases, encyclopaedias, virtual libraries etc. The paper also contains various examples of  these sources with their Universal Resource Locator (URLs). 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The use of internet in the libraries is rapidly increasing and is changing the traditional functions and services of the libraries as well as role of the librarians. Internet is being used as an efficient medium for accessing, storing and disseminating of information worldwide. Internet also provides worldwide access to various useful paid as well as free information sources and services such as online databases, library catalogue, publishers’ catalogues, electronic journals, online encyclopaedias, online dictionaries, e-books, e-conferences, virtual libraries, website of organisations, etc. With the advent of computer,  networking and internet, it is possible to access information sources from anywhere at anytime. Many digital libraries, publishers and organisations provide access to their online information sources 24 hours to  global users on internet. Printed information sources are being replaced by electronic information sources and are available on CD-ROMs, online databases, internet and other networks due to developments in information and communication technology. Authors and publishers are also much in favour of making available their articles online  
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2004, 24(4) 
for a fee or free, because studies have shown  that online accessibility of articles have dramatically increased their citation, increasing the journal’s impact factor and the author’s prestige1. 
Internet is also being used as a very important tool to access free information sources and services. Free online information  sources and services can be access on internet without paying any subscription charges to the publishers and users do not need to have any membership in the organisation. Users can access and download required information available on these sources in their computers and can use  for their academic and research purpose only. 
The selection of free websites as part of collection development is activity practised by  many librarians and is an important topic for discussion3. With the introduction and popularity of internet, most of the commercial,  government, educational and research organisations/bodies/institutions such as banks, companies, universities, etc., have developed their own websites and provide latest and useful information including data, services, products, publications, programs and changes related to their fields/subjects.
