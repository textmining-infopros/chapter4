ABSTRACT
This paper attempts to analyse the growth and development of science and
technology (S&T) activities in India, as reflected in publication output covered by Science
Citation Index (SCI) during 1990-2004. The Indian scientists published a total of 1,82,111
papers in SCI covered journals during the above period. The present study analyses
the broad features of Indian S&T by focusing on its publication growth characteristics,
language, format and media of communication, research quality, institutional productivity,
patterns of research collaboration, and broad and narrow subject areas of interests
of Indian institutions and scientists. A broad comparison of India's research output with
select countries, particularly with China, has also been made.
Keywords: S&T, SCI, scientorometric, S&T publications, mapping

1. INTRODUCTION
India has a long and distinguished tradition
in science. The scientific thought and innovative
ideas relating to the technology have been
the part of Indian culture and the basis of
its civilization throughout the history going
back to the Indus valley civilization. Since
then, there have been many great discoveries
and technical achievements in India. It was,
however, only after independence and through
vision and wholehearted support of India's

first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that
science and technology (S&T) was developed
in a conscious way as a major force for
social and economic change in the country.
As a result of the efforts since independence,
the country has achieved a high degree of
self-reliance in several areas.
The development of S&T as a means to
meet vital needs is now accepted as a major
planning objective. Expenditure on scientific
research has gone up substantially from the
17

first plan (1951-56) to the tenth plan. The
central government account for major portion
(around 70-75 per cent) of the total expenditure
on S&T. The total annual expenditure on
S&T is now close to 0.8 per cent of the
gross national product (GNP). There has
been a significant expansion in the education
sector. India's R&D infrastructure at present
is made up of more than 300 universities,
400 research laboratories, 10 academic institutes
of national importance, and 1300 in-house
industrial R&D units. Besides, several other
government departments, private, international
and non-profitable institutions are also engaged
in R&D.
The major R&D agencies/departments
like Department of Atomic Energy (DAE),
Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department
of Ocean Development (DOD), Department
of Electronics (DoE), Department of Space
(DoS), Defense Research and Development
Organization (DRDO), Department of Science
and Technology (DST), Council of Scientific
and Industrial Research (CSIR), Indian Council
of Agriculture Research (ICAR), and Indian
Council of Medical Research (ICMR) account
for major share of research funding. The
main objectives of these R&D agencies/
departments are to support and coordinate
research in their respective areas.
The research is carried out through a
chain of research laboratories/research institutes
under them as well as through research
grants/sponsored projects to higher education
sectors, national laboratories and establishments.
The academic institutes of national importance
like Indian Institute of Science, and Indian
Institutes of Technology (IITs) also play a
major role in carrying out R&D activities in
the country.
Evaluation is one of the key components
of any R&D activity. One well-known productivity
indicator of the R&D is the number of publications
produced by the scientists, institutions and
the country. Analysis of publications provide
some insight into the complex dynamics of
research activity and enables policy makers
and science administrators in framing policies
and directions in which R&D has to be conducted.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Very few studies are available, which
attempt to make assessment of Indian science
in respect of science publications. Eugene
Garfield 1 carried out the first major analysis
of world research output, with particular reference
to third world science publications in 1973,
using SCI database and their citations received
from 1973 to 1978. India and Argentina were
the only two developing countries ranked 8 th
with 7888 papers and 15515 citations, and
25 th with 1526 papers and 4110 citations,
respectively finding place among top 25 countries.
Out of the 353000 articles indexed in the
1973 SCI file, only 16000 articles were authored
from the 93 third world countries.
India accounted for half of all the articles
from the developing countries. Raghuram
and Madhavi2 highlighted the decline in Indian
science in their letter published
Naturein
by analysing Indian contributions in the journals
indexed in SCI during 1980-1995. According
to them, India has not kept pace with the
growth in world science output. India's
publications output was over 13100 papers
in 1981, which declined by 15 per cent by
1995, whereas the world's annual output
increased by 24 per cent during the same
period. India's share in world output was 2.5
per cent in 1981, which dropped to 1.58 per
cent in 1995; its world rank dropped from 8 th
to 13 th during the corresponding period. The
concern for decline in Indian science, was
raised by Arunachalam 3 in his letter, "Is
science in India on the decline", published
in Current Science. He noted that in 1980,
India accounted for 14983 papers in SCI,
which had fallen to 12127 papers by 2000.
It was observed that India's publication
output was steady over two decades and
reached an equilibrium position, whereas
output of other developing countries showed
an appreciable upward trend. Mehrotra and
Lancaster4 analysed different features of Indian
science using 38000 research publications
produced in India during 1979 to June 1981.
Another study was undertaken by Arunachalam,
et al. 5 based on the analyses of more than
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(1)

Garg and Dutt 6 analysed 12156 papers
published by Indian scientists during 1987.
Basu and Nagpaul 7 made a bibliometric
assessment of Indian science based on the
SCI for 1990 and 1994. Kademani, et al. 8
analysed 55313 papers published by Indian
nuclear scientists during 1970-2002 based
on INIS database. Kademani, et al. 9 made
a scientometric assessment of thorium research
in India. India ranked second among other
countries based on INIS database during
1970-2004. Kademani, et al. 10 also made
the assessment of thorium research based
on SCI for 1982-2004 and similar results
were obtained. There are a few bibliometric
studies also on Indian research in different
domains11-14.

3. OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of the paper are to
analyse Indian S&T output in terms of its
broad characteristics, quality of its research
output, characteristics of high productivity
institutions, nature of collaboration, broad
and narrow subject areas of emphasis, and
comparison of India's research output with
select developed and developing countries.

4. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Publications data was collected from
the SCI (1990-2004) published by the Institute
of Scientific Information, Philadelphia (now
a division of the Thomson Corporation). A
total of 1,82,111 publications records from
Indian scientists and institutions were downloaded
and analysed as per objectives of the study.

period (Table 1).
5.1.2 Language, Format and Channels
of Communication
On analysing the language of communication
used by Indian scientists, English was found
to be on top of the list with 1,82,017 (99.94
per cent) publications followed by French
(23), Russian (23), German (21), Chinese
(11), Romanian (6), Spanish (6), Danish (2),
Italian (1), and multilingual (1). Indian scientists
contributed their research publications
predominantly in English with only a few
exceptions. The publications in other foreign
languages were mainly due to collaboration
with respective foreign institutions.
The Indian scientists communicated their
research results in variety of communication
formats (Table 2). More than 85 per cent of

the Indian S&T research was published as
journal articles, followed by notes (4.47 per
cent), letters (3.87 per cent), meeting-abstracts
(2.48 per cent), etc. The total Indian publications
in S&T were published in over 3895 journals.
The maximum number of publications (6848
papers) appeared in Current Science, followed
by Indian Journal of Chemistry-Section B
(3566 papers), Indian Journal of ChemistrySection A (3272 papers), Pramana–Journal
of Physics (1904 papers), etc.
Table 3 gives the list of top 50 productive
journals preferred by the Indian scientists
for publication. These 50 top journals together
contributed 50,968 papers, which constitute
25.53 per cent of the total Indian publications
output in S&T during 1990-2004. Of these 50
journals, the first 15 journals contributed 28,406
papers (14.78 per cent), next 15 journals
11,374 papers (5.93 per cent), and next 20
journals 11, 188 papers (with 5.82 per cent)

5.2 Quality of Research Output
Around 92.33 per cent of the total Indian
publications in S&T during 1990-2004 were
published in the journals with impact factors
(IF) ranging from 0.01 to 35.04, and around
7.67 per cent in journals having zero IF.
A significantly large number of publications
(67.50 per cent) appeared in low-impact journals
(IF = 0.01 to 2.0), 22.92 per cent in medium
impact journals (IF = 2.01 to 4.0), and only
7.55 per cent in high impact journals
(IF > 4). On studying the increase in quality
of papers during 1990-94 to 2000-04, it was
found that while the share of papers in zero
IF journals substantially reduced from 15.21
per cent to 2.03 per cent, the share of papers
published in medium and high IF journals
increased from 14.80 per cent to 22.92 per
cent and from 5.34 per cent to 7.54 per
cent, respectively, showing improvement in
the quality of Indian research with time
(Table 4).

5.3 Broad and Narrow Subject
Area of Publications
On classifying the total Indian publications
output in S&T under 11 broad subjects during
1990-2004, it was observed that maximum
number of publications were in chemistry
(40640), followed by physics (37822), basic
life sciences (15797), engineering (14679),
clinical medicine (14763), earth and environmental
sciences (8027), multidisciplinary sciences
(7771), biology (7700), agricultural sciences
(6,300), mathematics (2247), and social sciences
(329). A broad distribution of Indian S&T
publications classified under 168 sub-fields
under 11 broad subjects is given in

Appendix I. The research output in these
168 sub-fields varied from 1 to 10800 papers.
Of these total sub-fields, 49 sub-fields together
contributed 79.23 per cent of the total papers.
On further classifying these 49 sub-fields on
the basis of output, the first two sub-fields
contributed 21162 papers (11.62 per cent),
the next four sub-fields contributed 29928
publications (16.43 per cent), the next five
sub-fields contributed 24786 publications (13.61
per cent), the next 113 sub-fields contributed
34491 publications (18.93 per cent), and the
next 25 sub-fields contributed 33949 publications
(18.64 per cent).
On further consolidating various subfields under broad subjects, it was found
that Indian scientists had published 40640
papers in chemistry during 1990-2004, which
were spread out across 9 sub-fields, with
maximum number (10800) of papers in
multidisciplinary chemistry followed by organic
chemistry (10362), physical chemistry (5931),
polymer science (4796), inorganic and nuclear
chemistry (4422), analytical chemistry (2066),
medicinal chemistry (1073), electrochemistry
(763), and applied chemistry (427). Similarly
37822 papers were published by Indian scientists
in physics during 1990-2004, which were
spread out in 14 sub-fields, with maximum
number of papers in multidisciplinary physics
(7112) followed by condensed matter physics
(6938), atomic, molecular and chemical physics
(3900), astronomy and astrophysics (3459),
applied physics (3432), crystallography (2566),
nuclear physics (2370), optics (1717), fluids
and plasma physics (1661), particle physics
(1322), spectroscopy (1254), mathematical
physics (924), acoustics (808), and
thermodynamics (359) (Table 5). In mathematics,
Indian scholars published 2247 publications

5.4 Nature of collaboration
On analysing the extent of collaboration
in S&T output during 1990-2004, it was found
that only 10 per cent publications (18224)
involved single authors and 90 per cent
publications (163887) involved multi-authors
indicating very large collaborative output from
Indian scientists.
Over the years, the multi-authored
collaborative papers increased from 48236
(with 88.93 per cent share) to 63847 papers
(with 91.17 per cent share). Among the
multi-authored collaborative papers, the share
of two-authored papers decreased from 39.68
per cent (19143 papers) during 1990-94 to
28.96 per cent (18492 papers) during

2000-04, while the share pf papers involving
more than two authors increased from 60.32
per cent (29,3 papers) to 71.04 per cent
(45355 papers) during the corresponding period
(Tables 5 and 6) .
Out of 182111 publications published in
the country during 1990-2004, only 31186
(17.12 per cent) involved international
collaboration. India's international collaborative
share of papers in country's total output
increased from 12.55 per cent to 21.11 per
cent during 1990-94 to 2000-04. In overall,
compared to the growth rate of 29.06 per
cent of Indian research output during 199094 to 2000-04, the growth rate in international
collaborative publications output was 117.16
per cent during the corresponding period
(Table 7).

5.5 Most Productive Indian R&D
Institutions
Eleven thousand five hundred fifty-five
Indian organisations published 182111 research
papers in S&T during 1990-2004. Of these
35 organisations published more than 1100
publications. On cumulating individual productivity
of institutions, the 10 Indian institutions
contributed 49936 papers (27.42 per cent of
national share), 20 institutions 78557 papers
(43.14 per cent share), 30 institutions 92893
papers (51.79 per cent share), and 35 institutions
100562 papers (55.22 per cent share). Thus,
the productivity of Indian research output
was highly concentrated with only 35 institutions,
which contributed more than 55 per cent
share in national output in S&T. The largest
number of publications (10247) were contributed
by Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
followed by Bhabha Atomic Research Centre,
Mumbai (6782); Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research, Mumbai (5132); Banaras Hindu

University, Varanasi (4487); All India Institute
of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (4201); Indian
Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (3957);
University of Delhi, Delhi (3902); and National
Chemical Laboratory, Pune (3813). Among
the top 35 Indian productive institutions, 11
were research institutes, 10 were academic
institutions of national importance and 14
universities and colleges. Analyses of the
growth and decline in publication productivity
using normalised activity index of the research
institutes, showed that only eight institutes
out of 11 witnessed rise in their activity
index during 1990-94 to 2000-04 (Table 10).
Analyses of the growth and decline in
publication productivity using normalised activity
index of 10 academic institutes of national
importance, showed that only four institutes
(IIT Chennai, New Delhi, Roorkee, and PGIMER,
Chandigarh) witnessed decline and the rest
six institutions witnessed rise in their activity
index during 1990-94 to 2000-04 (Table 11).
The same analysis of the universities and
colleges found that five universities (University
of Delhi, Panjab University, Anna University,
Christian Medical College, and Sanjay Gandhi
Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences)
out of 15 witnessed rise in their activity
index during 1990-94 to 2000-04 (Table 12).

6. CONCLUSION
The paper analysed the contribution (182111
papers) by the Indian scientists covered in
SCI during last 15 years (1990-2004). During
this period, India achieved an average annual
growth rate of 3.05 per cent of its publications
output, which is much less than China (13.58
per cent), but comparable to many developed
countries such as Japan (2.84 per cent),
France (2.37 per cent). In all, 11555 Indian
organisations were involved in these publications,
and the top 10 institutes published 27.42
per cent of total publications. Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, topped
the list among research institutes with 6782
publications. Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore, ranked first among academic
institutes of national importance with 10247
publications, and Banaras Hindu University,
Varanasi, appeared on the top among universities
and colleges with 4487 publications. The
quality of Indian research output as reflected
in IF per paper has improved with time. The
share of papers published in medium and
high impact journals increased from 14.80
per cent and 5.34 per cent during 1990-94
to 22.92 per cent and 7.54 per cent during
2000-04, respectively. The share of international
collaborative papers in total output increased
substantially, rising from 12.55 per cent during
1990-94 to 21.11 per cent during 2000-04.
The maximum numbers of India's collaborative
papers were with the US. The major fields
of publications during 1990-04 were chemistry
followed by physics, basic life sciences,
engineering and clinical medicine.
