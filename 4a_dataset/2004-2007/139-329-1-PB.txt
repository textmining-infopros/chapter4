INTRODUCTION

Uttar Pradesh (UP) is one of the most
important state of India, occupying 2,40,928
sq km 1, which is 7.32 per cent of total area
of the country. It is homeland for 1,66,197,921
people 1, which represents 16.15 per cent of
total population of India. The state has 57.36
per cent literacy rate2, and has made significant
progress in the field of agriculture, science
and technology, industry, and communication.
Today, there are 354 universities and universitylevel institutions 3 in India. Significantly, the
country has also recorded tremendous growth
in LIS education, which is being imparted
from certificate to doctorate level by a number
of institutions.
At present, 167 universities 4 and their
affiliated colleges/institutions are conducting
courses in library science in the country.
Eighty-seven universities/colleges at Bachelor’s
Received 10 February 2007, revised 11 July 2007

level and 89 at Master’s level are conducting
LIS education, respectively. While PhD (full
time) is offered by 49 universities, PhD (part
time) is also offered by three universities.
Eight universities and 12 colleges offer certificate
programmes and six universities and six colleges
offer diploma programme under regular mode
of education. LIS education is also being
offered by the universities under distance
mode of education. Five universities offer
certificate and diploma courses. Out of 34
universities 5 that UP has 14 are offering LIS
education.

PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF
THE STUDY

The purpose of the study was to assess
LIS education in UP, to find discrepancies,
and suggest measures for scientific growth
and development of LIS education in the
state. Objectives of the study were:
41

To trace and analyse growth of universities
and LIS schools in the state
To assess present status of LIS education
with the help of various parameters
To find out key factors responsible for
unscientific growth of LIS education in
the state
To suggest measures for scientific growth
and development of LIS education in the
state.

3. SCOPE OF THE STUDY
The present study is based on several
indicators, i.e., growth of universities and
LIS schools, status of universities, level of
courses, mode of education, and location of
LIS centers in the state. The study was
confined to LIS education being imparted in
the universities and its affiliated colleges. It
excludes LIS education at certificate level in
the universities. The study also excludes
LIS education at diploma level conducted by
Board of Technical Education in the polytechnics
because no exact data at certificate/diploma
level is available. Additionally, study excludes
Bhartiya Shiksha Parishad, which offers BLIS,
MLIS and PhD in library science, as recognition
of its degrees are under court jurisdiction.

4. LIS EDUCATION IN UTTAR
PRADESH
UP has 34 universities but LIS education
is being imparted in 14 universities only,
which represents 41.17 per cent of the total
universities of the state. The details of these
universities have been given in Table 1.

4.1 Growth of Universities/LIS
Schools of UP
Growth of 14 universities, which impart
LIS education in the state over the years,has
been given in Table 2. It highlights several
aspects like level of courses, mode of education,
and location of library schools and status of
universities. It indicates that 14 universities
were established during 1916-2005. The duration
of 1915-1925 was the golden period because
universities like Banaras Hindu University
42

(BHU), Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Lucknow
University (LU), and Mahatma Gandhi Kashi
Vidyapeeth (MGKVP) were established.
Normally, one or two universities were set
up during the decade 1915-1925, but in the
third and fourth decades (1936-1955) not a
single university was set up. However, after
independence, a large number of universities
were established in various parts of the UP.
Table 2 further highlights that LIS education
is being imparted in the state since last 63
years (1942-2005). The first Department of
Library and Information Science (DLIS) was
established in 1942, but no DLIS was opened
during 1946-1955. However, one or two DLIS
were set up in each decade except during
1996-2005 in which seven DLIS were set up
at various part of the state due to demographical,
political, educational, technological and social
reasons. This period may be called golden
period for LIS education in UP.

4.2 Status of the Universities
Status of the universities plays an important
role in the growth and development of LIS
education, e.g., central universities have better
resources in comparison to state/deemed
universities. During the period of 89 years
(1916-2005) different types, i.e., central, states,
deemed universities were established in the UP.
Ten universities in UP, i.e., Bundelkhand
University (BU), Chaudhary Charan Singh
University (CCSU), Chattrapati Shahuji Maharaj
University (CSJMU), Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar
University (BRAU), MGKVP, LU, Uttar Pradesh
Rajshree Tandon University (UPRTOU),
Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishvidyalya (SSV),
Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University
(DDUGU), Veer Bahadur Singh Poorvanchal
University (VBSPU) are state universities.
However, one among them (UPRTOU) is an
open university. It has been observed that
DLIS of central universities are in a better
position in terms of infrastructure facilities
in comparison of state/deemed universities.
UP is lucky to have three central universities,
i.e., AMU, BHU and Babasahib Bhim Rao
Ambedkar University (BBAU). The state also
has one deemed university, Allahabad Agriculture
Institute (AAI) at Allahabad.

is one year. BLISc is the minimum requirement
for admission in MLISc. BBAU, has twoyear MSc in Information Science with minimum
qualification required is BA/BSc/BCom.

Level of courses is one of the indicators
to assess the LIS education in the schools.
A number of courses of different levels have
been included in the study. LIS education
being imparted in the universities in UP is
at four levels, i.e., Diploma, Bachelor, Master
and research (MPhil/PhD). DLIS having various
levels of courses have been shown in the Table 3.

It is remarkable that six universities,
i.e., AMU, BHU, BRAU, LU, BU, UPRTOU
also have PhD programmes in LIS. The MPhil
is being offered by UPRTOU and BU. The
duration of the MPhil programme in BU is
one year. The minimum qualification required
for MPhil is Master’s degree with 55 per
cent marks. UPRTOU offers MPhil/PhD both
full time and part time 6. The full-time MPhil/
PhD is provided to those who are offered a
fellowship by the university or any other
agency, and are registered with the university
to pursue research degree programme on
full time. The part-time MPhil/PhD is offered
to the students who are employed. Duration
of PhD is 2-3 years with MLISc or equivalent
degree as minimum requirement for admission7.

Table 3 indicates that two universities,
i.e., BRAU and VBSPU offer diploma courses.
While central library of VBSPU conducts
diploma course, BRAU is imparting diploma
course in its affiliated degree colleges in
cities like Aligarh, Etah, Mathura, Shikohabad,
Kasganj, Ganjdundwara, etc. The duration
of diploma course is one year after 10+2.
All universities except BBAU impart LIS
education of Bachelor’s level. Eleven universities
offer Master’s degree. Duration of the MLISc

4.4 Mode of Education

4.5 Location of Library Schools

Mode of education is an important aspect.
LIS education is being imparted either in
regular or distance mode education or in
both. Mode of education of various universities
is shown in Table 4. It shows that 12 universities
impart LIS education in regular mode of education.
However, three universities (CCSU, CSJMU,
VBSPU) impart it in regular mode of education
but under self-financed system. LU offer regular
as well as self-financed system. Isabella
Thoburn College affiliated to LU is also imparting
BLIS in regular mode since 1962. LIS education
is also being imparted in distance mode by
the universities and affiliated institutions affiliated
to the universities 8. Only two universities
AAI, UPRTOU offer distance mode of education.
The affiliated institutions, i.e., Centre of Distance
Education, AMU; Institute of Management
Science, CCSU, Sahibabad (Ghaziabad); Rajeev
Academy of Technology and Management
and BSAC both in Mathura offer BLISc and
MLISc under self-financed scheme.

Location of city/town plays a crucial
role and highlights the importance of institution
in geographical context. Locations of LIS
schools in UP have been given in Table 5.
From the university’s point of view, Varanasi
is at the top. It has three universities (BHU,
MGKV, SSV) which offer LIS education. Varanasi
has religious and historical demographical
character. Lucknow also has three centre
universities, i.e., LU, BRAU, ITC (LU). Lucknow
is capital of UP and has thus political,
demographical, social and cultural character.
Allahabad has two universities (UPRTOU,
AAI). Jhansi has one LIS school. The cities
like Etah, Mathura, Shikohabad, Ganjdundwara,
Kasganj also have DLIS affiliated to BRAU.

MISCELLANEOUS ASPECTS

In addition to above, there are several
other aspects like medium of instruction,
system of admission, adequacy of faculty

members, infrastructural facilities, intake,
etc. 9 which affects LIS education. It has
been observed that there are variations in
the medium of education because of status
of the universities. For example, three central
universities (AMU, BHU, BBAU) offer LIS
education in English medium while state
universities offer in both English and Hindi
mediums. Only SSV College offers LIS in
Hindi medium.
Central universities have better resources
in comparison to state/deemed universities.
They have adequate faculty members, computer
labs, library and furniture, and information
technology oriented syllabus. It has been
observed that the universities which offer
LIS education under distance mode of education
have not maintained quality of education. It
has also been noticed that self-financed
institutions have commercial motives so that
they earn more and do not bother about the
quality of professionals 10.

6.

CONCLUSION

Uttar Pradesh has unique position among
28 states and 7 union territories of the country.
It is known for its demographical, geographical,
political, religious, cultural, and historical
characters. The state is developing at a fast
pace and has recorded significant progress
in several fields. Therefore, a large number
of institutions will be needed to meet the
manpower need of the state.

furniture, etc. should not be allowed to
come up
(iv) LIS at diploma level in the university
should be discouraged because concept
of university starts at graduation level
(v) Quality of education should not be
compromised for producing competent
professionals
(vi) To bring consistency in terms of contents
of syllabus, admission policy and
examination procedure, adequacy of faculty
members, non-teaching staff, infrastructural
facilities should be as per the guidelines
of UGC
(vii) Cooperation and coordination among DLIS
and university libraries of the state should
be encouraged to achieve objectives of
LIS education in a better way.

No doubt, to fulfill manpower needs in
the field of LIS, new LIS schools would be
established. If the unbalance in the LIS education
continues, there will be problem of quality
manpower. Hence for scientific development
of LIS education, following strategies may
be adopted:
