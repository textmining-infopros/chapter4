ABSTRACT
The paper examines the growth and evolution of technical competence in the Council
of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) during 1976-2004, as reflected in patents
granted to CSIR scientists in India. The areas of technical competence were identified
and studied using International Patent Classification (IPC) code assigned to each patent.
In all 2841 patents were granted to CSIR scientists during 1976-2004, which were
classified into 352 technical areas. Of 352 technical areas, 46 areas alone contributed
1994 patents. Among these technical areas, 9 areas (1324 patents) were classified as
highly productive, 13 areas (372 patents) as medium productive, and 24 technical areas
(298 patents) as low productive. The analysis also identified areas of emerging
competence and future potential on the basis of evidence of patenting activity, particularly,
during the most recent period of 2001-2004.
Keywords: Technical competence, international patent classification, science & technology,
CSIR patents

1. INTRODUCTION
The Council of Scientific and Industrial
Research (CSIR) is the leading publicly funded
research organisation in the country. It
undertakes research in diverse fields of science
and technology like chemicals, drugs and
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, electronics,
glass and ceramics, leather, mining, minerals
and metals, oceanography, aerospace, and
scientific instruments. The emphasis is on
applied research and development, with the
aim of contribution to the advancement of
science, industry and fulfillment of the societal

needs such as food, fuel, buildings, roads,
etc. The scientists in CSIR are the repository
of knowledge and expertise in several areas
of technological competence nurtured over
the years.
Recently, CSIR took conscious decision
to implement several R&D programmes in
network mode by establishing synergy within
its vast multidisciplinary expertise, often niche
areas and competencies available in the
laboratories, which in turn has enhanced the
need of understanding the significant technical
competence of CSIR.
77

A few studies have looked into the concept
of competencies in the organisational context,
particularly, for firms and corporations 1-4. In
view of the changing economic and global
contexts, a dynamic organisation like CSIR
has to keep pace by continuously upgrading
its competencies and addressing the challenges
of new S&T developments, for example, aeroacoustics and aerospace materials, nanobiotechnology, cell and tissue engineering,
fuel cells, polymer materials, nanomaterials,
and nanocomposites. Selective support and
building up of necessary facilities including
the technical competence and human resource
development are essential for this purpose.
The competence of an organisation essentially
enables understanding of relatively unique
set of skills, which allow organisations to
successfully compete in the current and
future markets5. These competencies usually
describe the general technical capabilities
and skills that would be valuable for the
development of a wide variety of products
and output of an organisation.
The output of CSIR has grown considerably
over the years, both in terms of patents and
publications 6 . It has made significant
contributions in the generation and protection
of intellectual property and has achieved the
status of a leading publicly funded R&D
organisation in terms of patents obtained in
India and abroad. It had filed 260 and 58
patent applications in India and abroad during
1995-96, which increased to 407 and 645,
respectively, during 2005-06. The number of
scientific publications by CSIR scientists in
peer-reviewed journals also increased from
1576 (with an average impact factor 1.264)
in 1996 to 3018 (with an average impact
factor 2.01) in 2005 indicating qualitative
shift in the competence of scientists. The
external cash flow (earnings from
commercialisation of results of research) in
CSIR has also increased from Rs 245 crore
in 2000-01 to Rs 341 crore in 2005-06. Although
the output of CSIR increased, but the active
number of scientists engaged in R&D work
in CSIR decreased from 5,550 in 1995-96 to
4,635 during 2005-06. The competence and
skills of R&D scientists and their continuous
monitoring and strengthening is, thus, the
78

key component to sustain an accelerated
growth of output in CSIR. What are the key
competencies of scientists in CSIR? In which
technical areas of competence, R&D scientists
indicate strong capabilities and strengths,
both over short-term as well as long-term.
A review of the evolution and identification
of strong and weak areas of competences
of CSIR is likely to benefit the re-orientation
of current approach and strategy of preparing
the eleventh five year plan (2007-12) in the
emerging global and competitive context.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Several quantitative studies have been
published using patent data as an indicator
of innovation, technological change, R&D
policy and management 7. Studies have also
examined the patents granted to CSIR scientists
from several angles, such as trends in its
growth and output, productivity patterns, pattern
of collaboration among scientists, the nature
of sources used (patent and non-patent literature)
in citations, and commercialisation of
R&D8-14. There is, however, no study to examine
the international patent class in patent data
as an indicator of technological competence.
The present study analyses patents obtained
by CSIR in India with a view to examine its
areas of technological competence and
productivity of these areas during 1976-2004.

3. OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of the study are: (i)
to identify strong and week areas of technical
competence of CSIR scientists during 19762004; and (ii) to identify technical areas of
future competence and potential to CSIR
scientists. It aims to provide relevant insights
for policy-making by indicating most productive,
medium productive and low productive areas
of competence.

4. DATA AND METHODOLOGY
The data on Indian patents granted to
CSIR scientists during 1976-2004 was taken
from the two databases: (i) Database on
Indian Patents during 1976-2000, (INPAT,
(CD-ROM Version) developed by National
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(1)

Institute of Science Communication and
Information Resources (NISCAIR)15, New Delhi
and (ii) Database on CSIR Patents in India
during 2001-04 (available online) developed
by CSIR Unit for Research and Development
of Information Products (URDP) 16 , Pune.
International Patent Classification (IPC)
is a comprehensive subject classification
system applied to all patents by the patentissuing authorities and is denoted by a set
of symbols17. A complete IPC symbol comprises
section, class, sub-class and main group or
sub-group. Each patent indicates the international
patent class to which the invention belongs.
The technical subjects of inventions dealt
within patent documents indicate either the
intrinsic nature or function of a thing or the
way a thing is used or applied. The thing
may mean any technical matter, e.g., process,
product or apparatus. The technical areas
are defined at the level of a class or a subclass in the International Patent Classification
in a patent.
These classifications were analysed to
indicate the areas of competence of CSIR.
The areas were ranked on the basis of the
total number of patents obtained during 19762004, which enabled identification of productivity
according to technical areas in CSIR. Further,
the areas of sustained competence were
defined as the areas in which there was a

continuity of patenting activity during all the
six block-periods of 1976-80, 1981-85, 198690, 1991-95, 1996-2000 and 2001-04. The
areas of emerging future potential were also
indicated on the basis of analysis of patenting
activity during recent block periods 19962000 or 2001-04.

5. ANALYSIS OF DATA
5.1 Growth in CSIR Patenting
R&D scientists in CSIR obtained 2841
patents in India during the period 1976-2004,
with an average of 98 patents per year (Tables
1 and 2). The annual output in CSIR patents
showed a lot of fluctuations over the years,
which may be associated with frequent reorientation of R&D policies and shifting priorities
in research. The number of patents granted
to CSIR scientists increased significantly
during 2001-04, almost one and a half times
that of 1996-2000. The growth in patenting
is significant during post-WTO period (19962004), wherein the annual average reached
158.4 patents per year from 68.95 patents
per year in pre-WTO period (1976-95). The
result is in consistence with the pattern of
patenting by Indian organisations, which showed
that the annual average of patents in USPTO
rose from just 3.4 patents per annum in the
pre-WTO phase to 34.2 patents in the postWTO phase 12 .

5.2. Major Technical Areas of
Competence
The patents granted to CSIR scientists
(2841) during 1976-2004 are assigned to
352 technical areas. Of these, 46 technical
areas contributed 1994 patents, accounting
for 70 per cent of the total patents of CSIR.
These areas are classified as highly productive
(contributing 50 or more patents), medium
productive (contributing 20 to 50 patents),
and low productive (contributing 10 to 20
patents). In addition, there were several areas
with less than 10 patents in which patenting
continued for two or more block-periods since

1976-80. Detailed analysis of these areas
has not been made, as the patenting activity
in most of these areas was not significant.
5.2.1 Highly Productive Technical Areas
Under the high productivity category,
there are nine technical areas, which have
contributed 1324 patents (47 per cent of the
total). Table 3 lists highly productive technical
areas of CSIR along with the number of
patents contributed during 1976-04. These
technical areas except C12N and B01J are
also called the areas of sustained competence
in CSIR, as patenting activity in these areas
continued during all the six five-year blockperiods (Table 4). The patenting in area of
C12N (microorganisms or enzymes) increased
slowly since 1986-90 and peaked in
2001-04 indicating growing competence. In
the areas of acyclic or carbocyclic compounds
(C07C) and the pharmaceutical preparations
(A61K), there was a spurt in patenting during
2001-2004. In contrast, there was no significant
growth in patenting in three areas, viz., C22B,
B01J, and C01B during 1976 to 2004. The
patenting activity in high productive areas
generally increased significantly in the postWTO period (1996-04).

5.2.2 Medium Productive Technical Areas
Under the medium productivity category
(Table 5), there are 13 technical areas, which
have contributed 372 patents (13 per cent
of the total). Among these technical areas
foods, foodstuffs or non-alcoholic beverages
(A23L) indicated sudden spurt in patenting
during 2001-04, which may be the result of
the impact of the changes in the Indian
patents act on the sector of food and foodstuffs.
Some of these medium productive technical
areas also showed sustained competence.
These include measuring and testing: analysing
materials by determining their chemical or
physical properties (G01N); non-mechanical
removal of metallic material from surfaces;
inhibiting corrosion of metallic material; multistep processes for surface treatment of metallic
material (C23F); surface treatment of metallic
material by diffusion into the surface by
chemical conversion or substitution; coating
by vacuum evaporation sputtering, ion implantation
or by chemical vapour deposition in general
(C23C); and producing (pressing, extraction),
refining or preserving fats, fatty substances
(e.g. lanolin), and fatty oils or waxes including
extraction from waste materials, essential
oils or perfumes (C11B).
5.2.3 Low Productive Technical Areas
Under the low productivity category, there
are 24 areas, which have contributed 298
patents (11 per cent of the total).
Appendix I lists the low productive technical
areas of CSIR. E02D was the only technical
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Techol., 2007, 27(1)

area of sustained competence of CSIR under
this category.

5.3 Least Priority Technical
Areas
The technical areas of least priority were
defined as those in which patenting took
place only up to 1995. These included 32
technical areas with 158 patents wherein no
patents were taken beyond 1995 and included
C23B, B01K, C22D, G01B, C09D, D06M,
F24J, A01B, B41N, E21B, F23D, and G01L18;
and 120 technical areas (34 per cent of the
total) with a total of 172 patents (6 per cent
of the total), wherein there was no continuity
in patenting beyond one block-period and
only one or two patents were taken. It implied
that the research activity in these areas was
either dropped or not pursued or lead to any
patent in subsequent periods.
The patenting activity in 54 such areas
(67 patents) was not pursued beyond a fiveyear period of 1976-80 in 30 technical areas
(32 patents) beyond 1981-85, in 22 technical
areas (22 patents) beyond 1986-90, and in
14 technical areas (14 patents) beyond 199195. These areas did not reflect areas of
technological strengths of scientists in CSIR.
Some of such areas included producing decorative
effects (processes for applying liquids or
other fluent materials to surfaces (B44C),
destructive distillation of carbonaceous materials
for production of gas, coke, tar, or similar
materials (C10B), preserving paintings; surface
treatment to obtain special artistic surface

devices of the electrolytic type (H01G). The
analysis points out that the CSIR system
has kept its vibrancy in patenting by dropping
R&D in certain areas and not pursuing patenting
in a sustained or significant manner in these
areas.

5.4 Emerging Areas of Technical
Competence and Future
Potential
The emerging areas of competence were
defined as those in which patents were obtained
for the first time during a block-period as
well as during the recent block period 19962000 or 2001-04. In pre-WTO period, there
were 13 such areas (with 74 patents) during
1986-1990, viz., A23C, A61F, B22D, C02F,
C07J, H02P, F02B, F23C, A47J, A62C, B05D,
82

B25B, and C12P, and 10 areas (with 22
patents) in 1991-1995, viz. A01C, A01J, A23D,
C05B, C25F, E01C, F03G, F16C, F26B, and
H02J18. During post-WTO period, i.e., 19962000, there were 10 such areas (with 45
patents), viz., C25B, C07K, A21C, C07H,
C03B, B29C, A01H, A23J, A23N, and E21F18.
The number of patents in each of these
technical areas are not significant implying
that the competence in these areas needs
to be nurtured, if the areas are considered
of future potential.
Further, there were certain areas in which
a significant growth was obtained in patenting
during 2001-2004 over and above the level
in 1976-1980. These emerging areas were
defined as the areas of future potential. In
highly productive technical areas, all but the
areas of C01B and C22B were such areas.
Similarly, in areas with medium productivity,
the areas of A23L, C08F, C01G, and A01N,
reflected the areas of emerging competence
and future potential.
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(1)

There were 32 new technical areas (37
patents) during 1996-2000, and 21 new technical
areas (27 patents) during 2001-04 in which
patenting activity took place for the first
time, wherein mostly single patent was taken
during respective period. These areas may
or may not be pursued in the future. New
areas in 2001-04 included the areas of A01F,
A01G, A22C, A23K, A23N, A41G, A43C, A62D,
AG1K, B05C, B27N, B64C, B43K, B60R,
H04K, C22F, F16D, F27, F28F, C03G, and
C02F18. Some of these areas are: manufacture
by dry processes of articles, with or without
organic binding agents, made from particles
or fibres consisting of wood or like organic
material (B27N), details of heat-exchange
or heat-transfer apparatus, of general application
(F28F), and magnets; inductances; transformers;
selection of materials for their magnetic properties
(H01F).

6. CONCLUSIONS
R&D scientists in CSIR obtained 2841
patents in India during 1976-2004, an average
of 98 patents per year. The growth of patenting
in CSIR accelerated since 1995, the year of
signing of the Agreement on Trade related
aspects of Intellectual Property Rights under
WTO. It increased significantly during
2001-04, almost one-and-a-half times that
of in 1996-2000.
The patenting activity in CSIR is distributed
over 352 technical areas. Of these, only 46
areas (nearly 13 per cent of the total) produced
1994 patents (70 per cent of the total). The
nine highly productive areas produced 1324
patents (47 per cent of the total). There was
a spurt in patenting in the areas of acyclic
or carbocyclic compounds and the
pharmaceutical preparations during 2001-04.
The patenting in the area of microorganisms
or enzymes increased slowly and peaked in
2001-04 indicating a growing competence.
The 13 medium productive areas produced
372 patents (13 per cent of the total). The
area foods, foodstuffs, or non-alcoholic beverages
indicated sudden spurt in patenting during
2001-2004, which may be the result of the
impact of the changes in the Indian Patents
Act in the sector of food and foodstuffs.
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Techol., 2007, 27(1)

Twenty-four low productive areas produced
298 patents (11 per cent of the total) during
the period 2001. The technical areas of least
priority were defined as those in which patenting
took place only up to 1995. There were 32
technical areas of least priority with 158
patents. The emerging areas of competence
were defined as those in which patents were
obtained for the first time during a blockperiod as well as during the recent block
period 1996-2000 or 2001-04. In pre-WTO
period, there were 13 such areas (with 74
patents) during 1986-90 and 10 areas (with
22 patents) in 1991-95. During post-WTO
period, i.e., 1996-2000, there were 10 such
areas (with 45 patents), viz., C25B, C07K,
A21C, C07H, C03B, B29C, A01H, A23J, A23N,
and E21F.
There were certain areas in which significant
growth was achieved in patenting during
2001-04 over and above the level in 1976-80.
These emerging areas were defined as the
areas of future potential. In highly productive
technical areas, all but the areas of C01B
and C22B were such areas. Similarly, in
areas with medium productivity, the areas of
A23L, C08F, C01G, and A01N, reflected the
areas of emerging competence and future
potential.
