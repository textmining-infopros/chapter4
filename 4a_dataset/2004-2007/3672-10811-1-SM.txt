    Bibliometric Study of Literature on Bibliometrics 
Swapan Kumar Patra, Partha Bhattacharya, & Neera Verma 
Abstract 
This paper analyses growth pattern, core journals and authors' distribution in the field of bibliometrics using data from Library And Information Science Abstracts (LISA). Growth of literature does not show any definite pattern. Bradford’s law of scattering is used to identify core journals and determines 'Scientometrics' as the  core journals in this field. Lotka’s law was used to identify authors’ productivity patterns. It is observed that authors’ distributions do not follow original Lotka’s law. Study also identified 12 most productive authors with more than 20 
publications in this field.  
1.  INTRODUCTION 
The terms bibliometrics and scientometrics  have been introduced simultaneously by Pritchard, Nalimov and Mulchenko in 1969. Pritchard1  defined the term 'Bibliometrics' as 'the application of mathematical and statistical  methods to books and other communication medium'. Nalimov and Mulchenko2  defined 'Scientometrics' as 'the application of those quantitative methods which are dealing with the analysis of science viewed as an information process'. So, scientometrics is the  measurement of science communication, and bibliometrics deals with more general information processes. Although, famous Bradford’s law (1934) of scattering, Lotka’s law (1926) of scientific productivity are regarded as milestones in bibliometrics, but bibliometrics/scientometrics research actually started in late sixties. Later in the seventies and eighties, bibliometrics research took a distinct shape and emerged as a prominent discipline. Major boost to the scientometrics research was with the publication of the journal 'Scientometrics' in late seventies particularly  devoted to   bibliometrics/sciento- metrics. With the advent of information and communication technology (ICT), web technology and availability of different

databases online, the field of bibliometrics gain a momentum. Increasing CPU speed and online availability of various databases makes bibliometrics research much easier and no longer a manual task. This study aims  to find out the growth pattern, core journals, authorship pattern and productive authors in this field. 
2. METHODOLOGY 
In this work, the data for analysis was downloaded from LISA (Library And Information Science Abstracts)  produced by Cambridge Scientific Abstracts (CSA). LISA  is  an international abstracting and indexing service specially designed for library and information professionals. It covers about 440  periodicals from more than 68 countries and in 20 different languages. It started indexing since 1969 and updated every two weeks. Its subject coverage includes all aspect of Library and Information Science (LIS) including artificial intelligence, book reviews, CD-ROMs, computer science applications, information centres, information management,  information science, information storage and retrieval, information technology, internet technology, knowledge management, librarianship, libraries and archives, library

management, library technology, library use and users study, medical informatics, online information retrieval, publishing and book selling, records management, telecommunications, technical services, world  wide web. The search terms used were "Bibliometrics” OR “Scientometrics” OR “Webometrics” for retrieval of records. Up to September 2005, 3781 records were retrieved  for the bibliometric analysis.  
3. DATA ANALYSIS 
The retrieved data contains mostly journal articles. Only 53 conference proceedings were found. These records are further analysed using Microsoft Excel and Access for getting further bibliometrics indicators. The  results shows that there is no definite pattern of literature growth in the field of bibliometrics.  Scientometics  is the core journal, which covers mostly (41%) of the total literature coverage. Author with single publication is more predominant, about 77 % authors have only one publication and English is the predominant language of publication. 
3.1 Growth of Literature 
The  LISA  started indexing Bibliometrics literature in 1968. After that there was a growth of literature (Fig. 1). The highest literature growth occurs in 1999 where 208 records were indexed. In 2005 till September 106 records has been indexed. For the last 
 Fig 1. Growth of literature 
28 
few years’ trend it can be concluded that literature on bibliometrics has no definite growth pattern. As usual in other subject areas, for the first few years the growth of literature was exponential (1972-78, 1996-98)  after that growth is declining. The exponential  growth of literature in seventies may be due to the emergence of bibliometrics as a new discipline. Usually a new subject field produce  a huge amount of literature at the initial stage of its growth causes exponential literature growth. In nineties the exponential literature growth was due to the advent of computer and information technology and particularly the web technology. With the increasing CPU speed and availability of databases in various  formats foster this growth of literature. However, by observing the last few years’ trend it can be concluded that about 175 reference per year produced in the area of bibliometrics/scientometrics.  
3.2  Language of Publications 
It is also important to note the language of publication. As usual English is the predominant language of publications (Fig. 2).  Out of the 3781 records retrieved up to September 2005, English occupies the first position with 3110 records (82.25%). Russian language is occupying second position with 172 records (about 4.54 %). Also 85 records found in other languages. English is the dominant language in Bibliometrics because

Fig 2. Language of publications 
English is official language in many countries and many conference proceedings are published in English language only. 
3.3  Core Journals 
From the data analysis, it has been found that about 280 journals publish 3781 articles. Scientometrics  is in the top with 1571 articles,  which is about 41.54% of total publications, followed by  Journal of American Society of Information Science and Technology,  which published 197 articles (5.21%) as shown in table 1. 
Bradford’s law

 has been employed to identify the core journals in a given field. Bradford’s law reveals a pattern of how literature in a subject is distributed in journals.  According to Bradford’s law of scattering, 'If 
scientific journals are arranged in order of decreasing productivity of articles on a given subject, they may be divided into a nucleus of  periodicals more particularly devoted to the subject and several other groups of zones containing the same number of articles as the  nucleus'. Bradford’s law is useful for the librarians because it helps in identifying the core sets of journals, which publish the most contents of a given field. So, in modern day financial crunches, a typical Bradford analysis  suggests which journals will be included in a library collection4. Fig. 3 shows the typical Bradford curve where journals are plotted against their productivity. Scientometrics  is identified as the core journal, which publishes  most of the content because it is fully devoted  to bibliometrics/scientometrics. The top four journals contain 50% of the research output.

These journals are  Scientometrics, Journal of the American Society for Information Science & Technology, Nauchno Tekhnicheskaya Informatsiya, Revista Espanola de Documentacion Cientifica.  These journals may be regarded as the important sets of journals in the field.  
3.4  Authorship Pattern 
From the data, it has been found that about 4,000 authors publish 3,781 articles, which is 0.94 articles per author. It means single authorship is very common in this field. About 3,106 (77.65%) authors have only one publication and 470 (11.75%) authors have two publications. Table 2 shows the number of authors and their corresponding publications. Lotka's Law5, an inverse, square  law, is used to find authors productivity patterns. It states that for every 100 authors contributing one article, 25 will contribute 2, 11 will  contribute 3, and 6 will contribute 4 each. There is general decrease in performance among a body of authors following 1:n2. This ratio shows that some produce much more than the average. According to Lotka's law of scientific productivity, only six percent of the authors in a field will produce more than 10 articles. The general form of Lotka’s law5  can be expressed as:  
y=c/xn 
Using this formula and the modifications given by Pao, Fang6,7,8  the value of C for bibliometrics literature is determined to be 0.64 and n-2.09. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Goodness-of-Fit Test shows that bibliometrics  literature does not follow Lotka’s law. Figure 4  shows the Log-Log plot of authors’ number and their corresponding publications.

4.  CONCLUSION 
Bibliometrics is an important field of information science because it represents a unique set of techniques for the monitoring and analysis of information resources and for the management of knowledge in social and organisational contexts. Bibliometric methods are used in studies of properties and behaviour of recorded knowledge, for analysis of the structures of scientific and research areas, and for evaluation of research activity and administration of scientific information. Various statistical methods are applied to study to measure, authorship, citation and publication pattern, and the relationship within scientific domains and research communities and to structure of specific fields. In this sense, bibliometrics is also relevant for researchers, policy and decision makers and also researchers outside  the library and information science (LIS) field

to track the trend in the specific field in their research work. Moreover, bibliometrics studies should be encouraged to evaluate research performance of a particular field of research in a country. Even national science policy can be decided on the basis of bibliometrics/scientometrics study. It is expected that more and more subject experts would take keen interest in this area of study.
