Bibliometric Study of Cancer Research in India  
Swapan Kumar Patra & Partha Bhattacharya 
Abstract 
The paper has done a bibliometric analysis of oncology research in India. The data for the study has been downloaded from national centre for Biotechnology (NCBI) Pub Med. The study analyses literature growth trends. It also examines research activities in different countries worldwide. Bradford law of scattering was employed to identify the core journal, which published Indian cancer research literature. Lotka’s law was employed to study the authors’ productivity pattern. The study also identifies the active institutions in India, which published 
the cancer literature the most.  
1. INTRODUCTION 
There has been significant growth in the research literature on oncology in India. Searching the literature in this area from the International database gives an insight into the pattern of growth of this literature. The paper intends to make a bibliometric study of cancer-based literature being contributed by Indian authors. Bibliometric study is a simple statistical method of bibliography counting to evaluate and quantify the growth of a subject.1  The data for the study was downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Pub Med.2 Pub Med  (Published Medical Literature) is an online version of  MEDLINE, available free to anyone with internet access. MEDLINE  is the National Library of Medicine's bibliographic database covering the fields of medicine, nursing, dentistry, veterinary medicine, health care system and the preclinical sciences. The  MEDLINE contains approximately 12 million records dating back to the mid-1960's.  
2. OBJECTIVE 
Objective of the study is to find: q 
Growth trend of cancer literature in India q Research activities of other countries 
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2005, 25(2) 
q Document types in which cancer literature 
published 
q Authorship pattern 
q Identify the core journals which publish the 
articles  
q Indian institutes which publish 
predominently in cancer research. 
3. METHODOLOGY 
Data was downloaded from the  Pub Med database using the software Endnote7. A blank database format was created using the software Endnote.7  The software has powerful web interface, which can download records into the database. For downloading the data into the database, the search term applied was “Neoplasm” AND Author address= “India”. Neoplasm is the MeSH3 indexed subject heading. As indicated by Lancaster4, main heading can take care of synonyms, nearly synonyms and homonyms. We expected the maximum retrieval of records. A total of 6484 records were downloaded from Pub Med  on 25th May 2004. We found 76 records from the year 2004. As 2004 records are incomplete we had removed those records from the database. Now the database has a total of 
11 

========1========

6408 records. Each record contains English language abstract and bibliographic information (e.g. author, name of journal, author address). 
NCBI indexed only the first author’s address. We take the address listed in the record as the first author’s address for our analysis of author affiliation.  
4.  DATA ANALYSIS 
4.1 Growth of the Literature 
Figure 1 shows literature growth trends in Indian cancer research. Pub Med  has indexed  cancer research articles in 1987. In that year 70 articles have been indexed. After that there is a steady growth of literature. Except for the years 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998 and 2003, where the growth of literature decline from the previous year. After observing for the  last few years trends it can be concluded that on an average around 500 papers were published yearly. 
4.2 Country-Wise Distribution of 
Literature  
A total of 15,37659 records retrieved using  the key word “Neoplasm”. It has been observed that US is the largest literature producing country with 10% of the total literature published  by the US alone. India has a contribution of about 0.4%. Table 1

shows the country-wise distribution of cancer literature. It can be inferred from the table 1 that although in cancer related literature west is dominant, but the cancer related literature is distributed world wide. It means research in  this area is carried out worldwide. Unlike other field of research which is mainly concentrated on only in US and UK, worldwide literature distribution shows that the cancer research is getting attention worldwide. It is also important to note that Indian contribution in cancer literature is very less in comparison to other countries.

4.3 Document Type 
Although NCBI indexed articles in 54 different categories. For the convenience of the user, we have categorized the literature in  five broad type (figure 2) viz journal articles (5643 records), review (279 records), review of reported cases (282 records), randomized controlled trial (81 records) and others (123 records). Other categories include lecture, legal cases, letter to the editor, and so on. Amongst the entire categories, journal article accounts the  maximum. About 5643 articles from the journals, which is around 88% of the literature. This means that Indian cancer scientists are heavily dependent on the journal publication. Possibly it can be said that, this is the only mode of communication among the Indian cancer researchers.  
It is interesting to note that  Pub Med  has not covered conferences, from India. Proceedings of conference, congress and symposia are most important for a subject like  cancer research. This communication channel  is more effective and easier. Pre-conference and post-conference proceedings play an important role in communicating the latest development in the field. We did not find any record of conference coverage. It also shows MEDLINE’s biasness towards Indian conferences and seminars.

4.4 Authorship Pattern 
Lotka’s law5, 6,7  describes the frequency of publication by authors in a given field. It states that the number of authors making contributions is about 1/n² of those making one; and the proportion of all contributors, that make a single contribution, is about 60 percent.  This means that out of all the authors in a given field, 60 percent will have just one publication, and 15 percent will have two publications (1/2² times of 60). Seven percent authors will have three publications (1/3² times of 60), and so on. According to Lotka’s law of scientific productivity, only six percent of the authors in a field will produce more than 10 articles. Lotka’s law, when applied to large bodies of literature over a fairly long period of time, can be accurate in general, but not statistically exact.  The general form of Lotka’s law can be expressed as y=c/xn where y=percentage of authors, x=number of articles published by an author, c=constant and –n=slope of the log-log plot. There are altogether 8508 authors who contributed 6408 articles; on an average 1.32 authors per articles. Among 8508 authors, 4985 authors (58.59%) contributed only one article. 1274 authors (14.97%) contributed two articles and 657 (7.72%) authors contributed three articles. So, it can be said

that Indian authorship pattern in Indian cancer  research is in close conformity to original Lotka’s law. Figure 3 shows the graph in which the number of author is plotted with publication. The log-log plot of author number and their contribution gives a straight line which is a good fit to original Lotka’s law. 
As the authors’ list is long, we selected 19 authors (table 2) who published more than 50 articles. M.K. Nair, from Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, is the most productive

4.5 JOURNALS 
In total, there are 868 journals, which published 6408 articles. Bradford’s law 8,9,10  of scattering can be employed to study journal literature distribution. The Bradford’s distribution is used for identifying the ‘core’ journals. Core journals are central to a subject  because they produce most of a subject’s content. Other way, it is a Bradford analysis, which gives information about the amount and titles of core journals and about the number of journals needed to cover most of the relevant articles in a specific field. By graphically describing the scattering of articles in a specific field to different journals, it should be possible to divide, which journal should be included in a collection to cover a specific percentage of the relevant articles in the field. Because of increasing cost in today’s library and information centers a typical Bradford analysis can suggest the journals to be procured in a library collection, which cover the most articles in a given field. 
Figure 4 shows Bradford plot, where cumulative total of publications is plotted against the logarithm of journal’s rank. On a Bradford plot, the core journals are those whose points lay on the initial curved part of the ‘S’ until tangentially becomes a straight line. Here, we observe that the slope of the curve decrease slightly after the nineteenth journal, so it appears that the top nineteen journals are well in their way to form a core.

Core 19 journals in the order of number of papers published, which published 1/3 of the articles in this area are listed in the table 3. remaining literature is scattered in 849 journals. This shows scattering of the literature. This scattering of information poses  a great problem in information retrieval.  
Looking deeply into the 19 core journals, 11 journals are from foreign publications and rest 8 are from India. Nine journals do not have any impact factor because they are not indexed in SCI. Indian Journal of Cancer published by Indian Cancer Society is the first  ranked journal that publishes about 6% of the total articles. International Journal of Cancer, ranked fifteenth has the highest impact factor   (4.233) in 2001. It can be concluded that Indian cancer research articles are not published in high impact journals. 
4.6 Institutions 
It is also important to explore author’s affiliation in cancer literature. Authors are affiliated to 435 institutes including private clinics and individual addresses. 289 institutes have only one publication.  Table 4 Shows state-wise distribution of literature. Among the metropolitan cities Delhi ranks first. About 50 institutes in Delhi contributed 1640 articles, which is about 25% of total literature. About 57 institutes in Mumbai are in  second position with a contribution of 1147 articles, which is 17% of the total literature.  32 institutes in Calcutta published 281 articles  (5%) and Chennai published 241 (3.76%) of the total articles. We also analyzed records up  to the state level. Delhi is the most productive state with largest number of articles. This is because of high concentration of medical institutes and research centers.  From the north east, we found only 12 articles from Assam, 6 articles from  Manipur and 16 from Meghalayay. This may be due to the less concentration of research centers, universities  or medical colleges in the north east. In the eastern region, the output of research papers is less compared to other regions. As seen, 6 articles from Bihar and 24 articles from Orissa  were found. Among the Union territories, Chandigarh ranked first with 503 (7.85%) papers.

Table 5 lists top 27 institutions according to their number of publications. All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi is  in the top with 1037 papers followed by Tata memorial hospital, Mumbai. 
5. CONCLUSION 
The study is concerned about bibliometric analysis of Indian cancer research as reported in NCBI Pub Med. The study shows that cancer research in India is increasing, with a marginal decrease in the year 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997 and 2003. From the last few years’ trends, it can be said that Indian cancer researchers published around 500 literatures per year.  
Worldwide trend of papers show that the cancer research work is being done on worldwide basis. Still, US is the largest producer of cancer related papers.  
Pub Med  indexes biomedical literature published in different communication medium,  like other field of science and technology. Journal literature (88%) is the single most form of publication among the Indian scientists. Indian conference and symposia on cancer is not covered in MEDLINE. 
Authorship pattern shows a close conformity with the original Lotka’s law, where  58.59% of Indian authors have single publication, 14.97% publish two articles, 7.72% publish three articles.  19 most productive authors are identified who had published more than 50 articles.

Bradford’s law of scattering is employed to  identify core journals. 19 core journals are identified which contains 1/3 of the total articles.  Among 19 journals 11 journals are published outside India. Impact factor of the journals shows that Indian oncology related research publish in low impact journals.  
All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Delhi has produced maximum papers on cancer research followed by Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.
