ABSTRACT
The study examines the broad characteristics of India's physics publications output,
its subject areas of strength and also the extent to which country's research pursuits
have technological orientation. The study is based on contributions by Indian institutions
and scientists as indexed in INPSEC-Physics 1998. The study finds that India's physicsrelated contribution is significantly high (86 per cent) in Science Citation Index (SCI)covered journals, of which 26.4 per cent was in high-impact journals (IF = 1.5). Its
contributions in condensed matter physics and materials science are significantly strong
and also have technological orientation. The study also shows that there are wide
differences in the quantity and quality of publications output across various broad and
narrow subject fields under physics. The physics research activity is led by a select
number of institutions in the country. Out of 435 institutions participating in physics
research, just 20 had accounted for 50 per cent of the total output. The academic sector,
being the biggest of all the sectors in terms of participating institutions, made the largest
contributions to the physics output, followed by R&D sector, industrial sector, and
government sector. However, the share of academic sector in high-impact journals was
at second rank; the R&D sector topping the list. R&D sector also exceeds all other
sectors in terms of publication output per institution.

1. INTRODUCTION
Physics is known to have made severall
contributions to the economy of many nations.
It has been harbinger of the change, but it
has failed, till date, to get the acknowledgement
it deserves for its role and contributions.

This might be because physics has never
been instrumental in bringing about any industrial
activity directly or in generating any industry
on its own. There is no industry like ‘physics
industry’ in the economy of any nation. Physics
has always served as a bridge between knowledge
creation and wealth generation, particularly
55

in high-tech industry. The explosive growth
of information technology (IT), microelectronics,
and telecommunications has its roots in
condensed matter physics, materials physics,
semiconductor physics, and fibre optics. The
knowledge of physics has been instrumental
in the development of enabling technologies
for IT hardware, information processing,
information transmission, and storage. The
semiconductor industry, effectively utilises
the knowledge of solid-state physics, chemical
physics, plasma physics, materials physics
for several applications. Many other industries
are equally dependent on the developments
in physics 1-2 .
By utilising knowledge in physics, some
industries have been able to make landmark
contributions to the national economy of the
country, influencing especially its prosperity
and human life in meeting its needs. For
example, condensed matter physics finds
applications in medicine (x-rays, MRI), shelter
(composites in construction materials), security
(weapon systems), entertainment (films, radio,
television-flat panel display), communications
(pervasive-transistor, integrated circuits, lasers,
fibres), transportation (smart cars, levitating
trains, supersonic aircraft), and energy (solar
cells and fuel cells) 1-2 .
Physicists continue to apply physics
knowledge in other areas for studies on
technological developments. For example
physics has been applied in biology and
medicine for exploring the properties of
DNA, understanding the way proteins are
configured, and making improvements in medical
imaging (imaging lungs using laser-polarised
noble gases) 1-2 .

1.1 Physics Research in India
India has more than a century old tradition
of creating and nurturing physics at the highest
level. The country has produced physicists
of world fame known for their landmark
contributions. Over the years, it has been
able to establish and enrich its academic
and research institutions, their infrastructural
and research facilities, computing and network
facilities, put up a strong teaching and research
56

community and establish national and
international linkages 3 .
This has been possible because physics
research in India is basically an institutional
activity, pursued countrywide with funding
coming from several sectors including academic,
R&D, government, and industry. The academic
sector constitutes universities, institutions
of higher learning, and colleges. The R&D
sector includes scientific agencies/departments
and its constituents including Department
of Science and Technology (DST), Department
of Atomic Energy (DAE), Council of Scientific
and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department
of Space (DoS), Defence Research and
Development Organisation (DRDO), Department
of Electronics (DoE), Department of Ocean
Development (DOD), and Department of
Biotechnology (DBT).
These scientific agencies/departments
though survive on government funds, but they
are autonomous by character. The government
sector includes several ministries/departments
under the state/central government such as
Ministry of Information Technology, Ministry
of Non-Conventional Energy Resources, etc.,
and research organisations under them. The
industrial sector includes private and public
undertakings. By far, the organisations/
institutions belonging to academic and R&D
sectors have been contributing the largest
share (90 per cent or more) to the country’s
total output in physics. The remaining 10
per cent share is contributed by organisations
under government sector, industrial sector,
and others including private, non-profit and
international organisations.
There are nearly 435 physics-based research
institutions in country employing more than
5000 PhDs and several thousands Masters’
engaged in research programmes in the major
areas of physics. A large number of universities
are engaged in postgraduate teaching and
research and doctoral programme. As a result,
around 700 PhDs are awarded each year in
physics. India also has bilateral and multilateral
programmes in S&T with several different
countries including the USA, France, Russia,
Germany, China, the European Union, and
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(1)

the CIS countries. India also has collaboration
programmes with UN agencies like UNESCO,
UNDP, etc. Many of these collaborative
programmes are focusing on different aspects
of physics research.
Even though physics institutions are spread
throughout India, but research activity in
physics is confined mainly to select few
institutions only in the country. These institutions
are regarded as R&D leaders in this area.
Characteristically, these institutions are relatively
better placed as they possess highly qualified
and skilled manpower; endowed with strong
network linkages, command superior research
and technical infrastructure and the stateof-the-art research facilities.
These institutions are known to corner
major share of R&D funds given by Government
of India to support physics research in the
country. This is evident from the extramural
funding data for 1998-99: The Indian Institute
of Science, Bangalore, received 11 research
projects with a funding of Rs 430.29 lakh.
It was followed by National Aerospace
Laboratories, Bangalore (10 projects, Rs 58.30
lakh); IIT, Kanpur (7 projects, Rs 86.61 lakh);
IIT, Delhi (6 projects, Rs 61.31 lakh); IIT,
Mumbai (6 projects, Rs 26.11 lakh); National
Physical Laboratory, Delhi (5 projects, Rs
27.65 lakh); Jadvapur University, Kolkata (4
projects, Rs 18.07 lakh); Roorkee University
(3 projects, Rs13.07 lakh); Pune University
(3 projects, Rs 17.45 lakh); Osmania University,
Hyderabad (3 projects, Rs 23.92 lakh); Jawaharlal
Nehru University, Delhi (3 projects, Rs 12.08
lakh); IIT, Kharagpur (3 projects, Rs 14.99
lakh); Delhi University (3 projects, Rs 31.17
lakh); and Cochin University of S&T (3 projects,
Rs 21.95 lakh) 4 .
The scientific academies of the country
namely Indian Academy of the Sciences,
Bangalore, Indian National Science Academy,
Delhi, and the National Academy of Sciences,
Allahabad also play significant role in catalysing
and promoting physics research. They are
known for organising seminars, conferences,
discussions and dissemination of information
through research journals. In addition, there
are several other associations/societies created
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Techol., 2007, 27(1)

exclusively for serving the cause of physics
in the country. These include Indian Physics
Association, Indian Physical Society, Optical
Society of India, Indian Vacuum Society,
Ultrasonic Society of India, Acoustical Society
of India, Metrology Society of India, and
Materials Research Society of India. Indian
Physics Association also actively celebrated
in 2005 International Year of the Physics
in India, by organising several activities by
promoting physics education and research
at various levels and its utilisation in industry.
India publishes nearly 50 journals in physics
and physics related areas, brought out by
academic/professional societies, research
and academic organisations, and private
publishers.
The funding support pursuit is regulated
directly by scientific agencies/departments.
These agencies/departments also sponsor
research as well as offer extramural funding
in the higher education system including
universities and colleges, deemed universities,
and institutes of national importance. The
extramural funding is also provided even to
national laboratories. Besides, funds are provided
for collaborative research under the bilateral,
regional or multilateral programme.
During 1998-99, the R&D funding agencies/
departments funded 199 projects in physical
sciences. The Department of Science &
Technology funded 60 projects with an allocation
of Rs 1168.88 lakh. It was followed by the
University Grants Commission with 57 projects
(Rs 25.39 lakh); Defence Research &
Development Organisation, 30 project (Rs
199.56 lakh); Department of Atomic Energy,
21 projects (Rs 2234.55 lakh); Council of
Scientific and Industrial Research, 20 projects
(Rs 142.73 lakh); Indian Space Research
Organisation, six projects (Rs 25.39 lakh);
All India Council of Technical Education,
four projects (Rs 37.19 lakh); and Department
of Ocean Development, one project (Rs 6.90
lakh)4.
Evidently India commands a strong
infrastructural base for physics research.
Its R&D institutions are well equipped to
lead India in physics research, in developing
57

physics-based technologies directed at economic
development of the country and at influencing
the quality of human life. In this paper, publications
output of India has been studied at the institutional
level with a view to map India's contributions
to physics, its areas of strength and weakness
in physics research, and their technological
orientation.

2. METHODOLOGY
The study is based on India's contributions
in physics as indexed in INSPEC–Physics
database for the year 1998. INSPEC is
published by the Institution of Electrical
Engineers (IEE), UK. It is the most
comprehensive and leading bibliographic
database providing access to the world's
S&T literature in physics, electrical engineering,
electronics, communications, control engineering,
computers and computing, and information
technology. Over 3500 S&T journals and some
1500 conference proceedings, and numerous
other publications are scanned each year
by IEE for inclusion in the database.
The database now contains over seven
million bibliographic records. It is growing at
the rate of 350000 records per year. This
database has four sections: Section A: Physics;
Section B: Electrical & Electronics Engineering;
Section C: Computers and Control; and Section
D: Information Technology. The INSPEC–
Physics database classifies physics literature
under 10 main subject fields and 60 subfields (Appendix I). For studying the impact
of physics papers, impact factor (IF) data of
the reporting journals were used.
The data on IF were taken from Journal
Citation Reports (JCR) brought by Institute
for Scientific Information. India contributed
more than 25 per cent papers in journals
having IF =1.5 in 1998. I
India's contributions were categorised
into three groups: (i) high impact-those published
in journals having IF =1.5, (ii) medium impactthose published in journals having IF = 0.5
and < 1.5, and (iii) low impact-those published
in journals having IF = 0.5.

3. RESULTS
3.1 Broad Characteristics of
Publications Output in
Physics
3.1.1

Publications Size

The world output in physics has shown
positive growth in publications during 19901998. As reflected in the INSPEC-database
the world output in physics was 156367
papers in 1990, 158220 in 1994, and 193251
in 1998. The publications output posted 1.19
per cent growth between 1990 and 1994,
and 22.14 per cent between 1994 and 1998.
Contrary to the world trend, India's publications
output in physics posted negative growth
during the same periods. India published
4552 papers in 1990, 4211 in 1994, and
4480 in 1998, respectively. India's world share
in physics output was also on the declining
curve: contributing 2.91 per cent in 1990,
2.66 per cent in 1994, and 2.32 per cent in
1998. Evidently, India's publications output
did not keep pace with the growth in the
world output in physics, rather it showed
negative growth during 1990-1998. It is indeed
a matter for concern and serious debate.
3.1.2

Pattern of Communication

Of the 4480 contributions in physics
made by Indian authors, 4183 were in journals
(93 per cent) and 297 in conference proceedings
(7 per cent). The 'journals' seem to be the
preferred channel of communication of Indian
authors. Indian papers were published in
516 journals: 485 foreign journals (83.6 per
cent), and 31 local Indian journals (16.4 per
cent). The countrywise breakup of foreign
journals was: USA (143); UK (140); the
Netherlands (74); Germany (29); Switzerland
(27); and other foreign countries (72).
Of the 4,183 contributions in 516 journals,
3618 (86 per cent) were in SCI-covered journals
(having impact factor in the range of 0.012~28.933)
and the remaining 565 (14 per cent) in nonSCI-covered journals. Of the 3,618 papers in

DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(1)

the SCI-covered journals: (i) 26.4 per cent
were published in high impact factor journals
(IF = 1.5), (ii) 47.1 per cent in medium
impact factor journals (IF = 0.5 and < 1.5),
and (ii) the remaining 26.4 per cent in low
impact journals (IF < 0.5). Out of 516 journals
covered, only 31 were from India. Among
these 31 Indian journals, only 15 were covered
by the JCR; their impact factor was between
0.056 and 0.515; depicting low value journal
impact (Table 1). India's publication profile
in foreign journals form USA, UK, the Netherlands,
Switzerland, and Germany is as follows:
USA: 24 per cent publications were in
143 journals. Of these, 105 journals
had the IF range as 0.115 ~ 1.499, and
38 had IF range as 1.5 ~ 13.439.
UK: 19 per cent publications were in
140 journals. Of these, 109 journals
had the IF range as 0.012 ~ 1.499, 18
had IF range as 1.5 ~ 28.933, and 13
were non SCI-covered journals.
The Netherlands: 16 per cent publications
were in 74 journals. Of these, 52 journals
had the IF range as 0.139 ~ 1.499, 15
had the IF range as 1.5~5.631, and 7
were non SCI-covered journals.
Switzerland: Eight per cent publications
were in 27 journals. Of these, 20 journals
had the IF range as 0.160 ~ 1.499,
and only 1 had the IF as 1.503, and
6 were non SCI-covered journals.

Germany: 4 per cent publications were
in 29 journals. Of these 22 journals had
the IF range as 0.107 ~ 1.423, and 7
had the IF range as 1.5 ~ 3.295.
3.1.3

Publication Productivity Pattern

In all, 435 research institutions across
the country contributed to physics research
in 1998. Of these, 20 institutions account for
50 per cent of the total publications output
by India, 55 for 75 per cent output, and 94
for 85 per cent output. The size of their
contributions varied widely from 1 paper to
272 papers per institution. Based on their
contributions per paper, the 435 institutions
were categorized in three groups (Table 2
and Fig. 1).
3.1.4

Geographic Spread of Physics
Research

Geographically, the physics research activity
is spread across 26 Indian states and union
territories. However, publications output is
not evenly distributed across the states. It
comparatively high in 11 states per state
contribution ranging from 109 to 769 papers.
Collectively these 11 states account 92 per
cent share to the country output in physics
in 1998. The research activity in eight states
was of medium level per state contribution
ranging between 22 and 61 papers. Together

3.2 Mapping of India's
Contributions by Main
Subject fields in Physics
The publications output of Indian scientists
in the 10 main fields of physics was grouped
under three categories-high productivity fields,
medium productivity fields, and low productivity
fields-as depicted in Table 3. The country
average impact of publications output in physics
in 1998 was 1.032. At the subject level it
varied from 0.622 to 2.155. The country share

in high impact journals (IF=1.5) was 26.4
per cent and across the 10 main fields it
ranged between 8.5 per cent and 52.9 per
cent (Table 4).
The relative quality index (RQI) quantifies
publication share in high impact journal relative
to the country average. It highlights the fields
in which India is publishing more high quality
papers. These are: A1–the physics of elementary
particles and fields is 2.0. It implies that
impact of papers in this subject was twice
that of the country average of 1, A5–fluids,
plasmas and electric discharges (1.71), A3–
atomic and molecular physics (1.45), A2–
nuclear physics (1.4), A0–general physics
(1.15), and A9–geophysics, astronomy and
astrophysics (1.04).
Interestingly, these fields are not high
productivity ones but have shown impact
above the country average. It implies quality
in such low productivity fields is indeed very
high. The specific sub-fields of physics which
have contributed to high performance are:
A05-statistical physics (91; 1.769); A11–
fields and particles theory (52;1.925); A12–
particle theories and interaction models
(45;1.985); A13–specific reactions and
phenomena (52; 2.324); A21–nuclear structure
(62;1.817); and A98–stellar systems (84;1.607).
In addition two more sub-fields have done
exceeding well in terms of impact, A47–fluid

dynamics (49;1.723); A71–electron states
(58;1.508) (Table 5; Appendix I). The publications
output in A6–condensed matter: structure,
thermal and mechanical properties, A7-condensed
matter: electronic structure, electrical, magnetic,
and optical properties, and A8-cross-disciplinary
physics each was more than 500 papers. It
was well country average per field (361.8
papers). In A2-nuclear physics the publications
output was though of medium range but it
published 40 per cent more papers than the
country average in high impact journals. These
four physics fields possess high potential
for technological applications. Given their
publications output accounting for 57.7 per
cent country share and their RQI, it can be
inferred that physics research activity in
these four subject fields is indeed very strong.

3.3 Mapping of Contributions by
Different Sectors
The academic sector dominates in
publications output contributing 60 per cent
share to the country output, followed by
R&D sector contributing 37 per cent share,
followed by industrial sector (2.1 per cent
share) and government sector (0.9 per cent
share). The productivity per institution is

highest (29.2 papers) for the R&D sector,
followed by academic sector (8.95 papers
per institution), government sector (2 papers
per institution) and industrial sector (1.88
papers per institution). The quality index of
the R&D sector is 45 per cent greater than
the country average. The quality index on
academic sector ranked second, followed
by industrial sector, and government
(Table 6).
3.3.1

Academic Sector

The 300 institutions under this sector
comprised 108 universities, 10 institutions
of higher learning (IHL), and 182 colleges.
The university segment contributed 56 per
cent of its papers in SCI journals, followed
by IHL (22 per cent) and colleges (8 per
cent). The contribution (papers) in high impact
journals was the maximum by universities
(23 per cent of its total SCI papers), followed
by IHL (18 per cent) and colleges (15 per
cent). The average output per institution was
highest from IHL (66.2 papers) followed by
universities (15.74 papers), and colleges (1.62
papers). The leading Indian institutions under
academic sector are given in Table 7 along
with their individual output and IF values.

under Department of Space (DoS) contributing
in A9–'geophysics, astrophysics, astronomy',
and A4–'classical areas of phenomenology'.
Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory

(SSPL), Delhi (44 papers and IF = 0.168)
were the leading institutions under the DRDO
contributing in A7–’condensed matter: electronic
structure … ', and A8–'cross-disciplinary physics'.
3.3.3 Government Sector
The 21 institutions under government
sector 17 under central government, and 4
under state government) participated in physics
research. Their contributions were 65 per
cent and 35 per cent, respectively. The central
government institutions published 85.71 per
cent of their papers in the SCI–covered journals,
of which 22.2 per cent were in high impact
journals. The state government institutions
published 50 per cent of their papers in the
SCI-covered journals, of which 14.3 per cent
in high impact journals. The average output
per institution was higher for state government
institutions (3.50 papers) than for central
government institutions (1.53 papers).
3.3.4 Industrial Sector
The industrial sector comprising 51
institutions (35 under public sector and 16
under private sector) participated in physics
research. Their contributions were 79.2 per
cent and 20.8 per cent, respectively. The
former published 90 per cent of its output
in the SCI–covered journals, of which 23.81
per cent were in high impact journals. The
latter published 46.7 per cent of its publications
in the SCI–covered journals, but their contribution
in high impact journals was negligible. The
average output per institutions was higher
by institutions under private sector (2.17
papers) than for public sector institutions
(1.25 papers).

4. CONCLUSION
India still publishes 86 per cent of its
physics output in low impact factor journals,
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Techol., 2007, 27(1)

and 26 per cent in high impact journals.
Three condensed matter physics fields account
for 52 per cent of the country output, the
remaining seven physics fields for the 48
per cent output. Only 55 top institutions
account for 75 per cent of the country output,
and just eleven states account for 92 per
cent of the country output. The academic
sector and the R&D sector together account
for 97 per cent of the country output. These
facts demonstrate that physics research in
the country is highly skewed in favour of
select institutions, select sectors, select
subject fields, and select states. India's high
publication output in condensed matter physics
fields, and nuclear physics, which together
account for 57.7 per cent of the country
output, does reflect that physics research
in India has strong technological orientation.
India’s high publication output quality
index is low as they publish bulk of research
output in low impact journals. Weaknesses
of these sorts are common not only to industrial
sector and government sector but even to
academic sector as well. India's research
base in physics, confined to just 435 institutions,
is still too small given the geographical size
of the country. It needs to be expanded.
India needs to focus its attention also on
medium ranking institutions across the country
for encouraging research output both in terms
of quantity and quality especially in physics
areas having potential for industrial and societal
applications.
