ABSTRACT
Any time series is forecasted using a suitable model based on the analysis of
historical data. The value of a model lies in the efficacy with which it performs the task
for which it has been constructed. A model is considered good if it fits the data well.
In other words, models should have good parameter values and fit statistics. Many
researchers have successfully applied various statistical models to analyse the growth
of literature data. However, there is no generalised rule or procedure put forwarded
by these researchers. The question, therefore, arises as to how one compares the
appropriateness of different type of models fitted to the data? The aim of this paper
is to forecast the time series of growth of literature data. Two different approaches
to probe this kind of data have been applied. These approaches are the multiplicative
seasonal model approach and nonlinear model approach where the trend has an
exponential growth form. It has been shown that there is plethora of models that come
out with good fit parameters. This communication thus highlights some basic issues
related to forecast of growth of literature data.
Keywords: Historical data, time senses, dynamic models

INTRODUCTION

A time series is a series of observations
taken sequentially over the time. The order
in which the observations are included in
the data set is very important in a time
series. Unlike regression models, it is the
Received 9 February 2007

ordering property, which distinguishes time
series from other series data. Forecasting
and time series are also distinct. While a
forecast is a view of an uncertain future, the
time series is a description of what has
actually happened. The aim of this paper is
to forecast a time series. This has been
3

done with the construction of a suitable model
based on the analysis of historical data.
Three basic model forms are critical for the
description of time series and forecasting.
These are trends, seasonal/cyclical variations,
and regressions. A dynamic model is a
combination of these basic forms with a
variance law included. Dynamic models allow
changes in parameter values as time passes.
The value of information depends heavily on
the time it is from. Because of many factors
that change with time, any information at a
particular point of time would definitely loose
its relevance at another point of time. It is
equivalent to state that more attention is
paid to the more recent data than the older data.
In model building there is a set of rules,
but not a hard and fast rule as there is no
model, which is the only best model. The
value of a model lies in the efficacy with
which it performs the task for which it has
been constructed. The forecasts made are
nothing but probabilistic statements with a
condition about the present state of knowledge.
Unfortunately, many functions in real-world
situations are nonlinear in parameters. Some
nonlinear functions can be linearised by
transforming the independent and/or dependent
variables. But one often encounters functions
that cannot be linearised, so the problem of
estimating the nonlinear parameter arises.
This paper discusses the approaches followed
in nonlinear curve fitting and demonstrates
a method of linearising and estimating a
nonlinear model.

DATA: A PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATION

The simplest method to collect the
growth data on scientific specialties is either
through computerised database on various
subject fields or printed abstracting services
and bibliographies. There are, however a few
databases, abstracting services, and printed
bibliographies, which have a long history of
development of subject fields. For modelling
the growth of data, it is necessary to have
a sufficiently large time series. Keeping this
in mind, chemical sciences research output
as reflected in Chemical Abstracts for the
4

period 1901-1994 (referred as CHEM) has
been selected.
The series behaves like an exponential
growth series. The seasonal component seems
to have a random effect. The amplitude increase
quite definitely appears to have a direct
relationship with underlying series level. The
techniques of data transformation is one
useful way in which data structures of the
amplitude trend relationship kind may be
directly addressed. Natural candidates for
variance stabilisation in this case are logarithmic
transformation and power transformations.
The number of publications was at the minimum
around 1918. The next low was observed in
1945. From 1918 to 1945, the series behaved
like a skewed curve. From 1945 onwards till
1970 it showed an exponential growth. It
took a dip around 1972 and then again increase
exponentially. Thus, as the level is increasing,
the seasonal pattern is varying more prominently.
The natural logarithmic series shows an
interesting cyclical trend. From 1904 to 1918,
it is the first cycle; 1919 to 1945, second
cycle; and 1946 to 1993, third cycle. Another
prominent thing is the beginning of elevation
just after 1993, which could be taken as the
beginning of the next cycle.

METHODOLOGY USED

Many researchers like Egghe and Rao,
Wolfram-Dietmar, Chu-Clara M. and Liu-Xin,
Gupta and Karisiddappa1-3, etc. have applied
various statistical series to analyse the data.
Few of these models are: Bass model,
modified Bass model, Mansfield model,
Exponential-logistic model, Gompertz model,
and Power model. These models gave good
parameter values and fit statistics, but none
of the researchers were able to put forward
a generalised rule or procedure. West and
Harrison 4 described an alternate model for
this type of series where the seasonal amplitude
increases with level, the multiplicative seasonal
model. The model is nonlinear but may be
analysed in the linear framework using a
suitable transformation. The log-transformed
data, in this case, gives a linear trend. Shumway5
estimated a nonlinear model for the raw
earning series with additive trend and seasonal

components, where the trend has an exponential
growth form.

level
= φ level t-1 + ω t
t
where ω t is an unknown stochastic term.
It is the unknown multiplicative factor φ ,
which make the model nonlinear. The model
may be linearised by using an estimate of
the growth rate at each time. For forecasting
at time t one could set this estimate to be

φt+1 ={E(level t/ data t)}/{E(level t-1/ data t)}
Operationally, we might simplify this
estimate using the online estimated level at
time t-1. {E(levelt-1/datat), in the denominator
rather than the one-step back-filtered estimate.
Curve Expert 1.3 has been used for
analysing the series. In Curve Expert, the
nonlinear models have been divided into families
based on their characteristic behaviour. These
families
and
their
members
are
enumerated below.

3.1 Exponential Family
Exponential models have the exponential
or logarithmic functions involved. These are
generally convex or concave curves, but
some models in this group are able to have
an inflection point and a maximum or minimum.
Exponential
Modified exponential
Logarithm
Reciprocal logarithm

: y = a*exp(b*x)
: y = a*exp(b/x)
: y = a+b*ln(x)
: y = 1/[a+b*ln(x)]
: y = exp[a+b/x+c*ln(x)]

3.2 Power Family
Power family involves raising one or
more parameters to the power of the independent
variable, or raising the dependent variable
to the power of a given parameter. This
family is generally a set of convex or concave
curves with no inflection points or maxima/
minima.

3.3 Yield-density Models
Yield-density models are widely used,
especially in agricultural applications. These
models historically have been used to model
the relationship between the yield of a crop
and the spacing or density of plants. Essentially
two types of response are observed in practice:
the 'asymptotic' and 'parabolic' yield-density
relations. If the response is such that as
density (x) increases, but the yield (y) approaches
a fixed value, the relationship is asymptotic.
If the response is such that there is a distinct
optimum as the density increases, the relationship
is parabolic. Of course, these types of
relationships occur commonly in other scientific
areas, therefore, this family of models is
very useful.
Reciprocal model
Reciprocal quadratic
Bleasdale model
Harris model

: y = 1/(a + bx)
: y = 1/(a + bx + cx2)
: y = (a + bx)(-1/c)
: y = 1/(a + bxc)

3.4 Growth Family
Growth models are characterised by a
monotonic growth from some fixed value to
an asymptote. These models are most common
in the engineering sciences.
Exponential assoc (2) : y = a*[1-exp(-bx)]
Exponential assoc (3) : y = a*[b-exp(-cx)]
Saturation growth
: y = ax/(b+x)

3.5 Sigmoidal Family
Processes producing sigmoidal or
'S-shaped' growth curves are common in a
wide variety of applications such as biology,
engineering, agriculture, and economics. These
curves start at a fixed point and increase
their growth rate monotonically to reach an
inflection point. After this, the growth rate

approaches a final value asymptotically. This
family is actually a subset of the Growth
Family, but is separated because of their
distinctive behaviour.

correlation coefficient). We started by fitting
models in the raw series. We fitted five
models (Table 1) and were able to explain
up to 98 per cent of the variance .

Gompertz model
Logistic model
Richards model
MMF model
Weibull model

The point, which is worth noticing in
Table 2 is that there is a very thin line of
difference between these fits and one wonders
that why a particular model only is
the best model.

just don't fit into nice categories.

which these ‘different’ nonlinear regression
models live.

ANALYSIS

The analysis of this problem has been
classified in three different moulds. All possible
models was explored to fit the given series
and 5-6 models have been listed, which fits
best (in terms of S and r, where S is the
standard error of the estimate and r is the

The third analysis was done on the
basis of Shumway's 6 work where he used
the estimate of the growth rate at each time
for linearising the model. The analysis of
this series used four models and all were
able to explain around 99 per cent of the variance.
Table 3 shows that these fits are the
most parsimonious among the other discussed
earlier. This approach has removed the
nonlinearity in the series, and hence giving
the best-fit values.

DISCUSSION

If one looks this with a critical eye,
some of the equations that have been fitted
are quite complicated. From this it appears
that polynomial models are having some
edge over others. To justify the need of
transformation and to analyze trends plot of
x and y showing the four best models based
on the row series (Appendix I), natural log
series (Appendix II), and Shumway’s work
(Appendix III) were respectively drawn.

Shumway's model, that has been fitted is on
the first differences. Thus, we reduced one
degree of polynomial fitting. The best approach
was to try to plot (after suitable transformation)
the first, second and third differences and
choose the proper degree when differenced
data do not show any trend, (should not be
overdone). Usually one or two differences do
the job. Once we have got rid of trend then
we should try to fit autoregressive or moving
average model, which take into account the
autocorrelations present in the data. This
is called Box-Jenkins's approach. The fitting
done here looks quite good but it is usually
seen that this approach, is not good for
forecasting, whereas in the Box-Jenkins's
approach forecast depends more on the

recent data than on the past date, and thus
giving a better forecast.

CONCLUSION

The big question, which automatically
arises, is how to compare the appropriateness
for the different type of functions fitted to
this data. Should one just fit all the commonly
used functions and see which one fits the
data 'the best'. A good analysis requires
robust techniques in assessing and empirically
developing the model. The data is never
wrong and thus 'statistics' should 'speak'
for the data. One should not lead by assumption
but should try empirical evidence. The data
7

itself suggests as to how and in what form
the history of the series is to be used. In
summary, we have not adhered to pre-specifying
the model but tried to develop the model by
keeping it simple and parsimonious. Nobody
can claim that a particular model is the true
equation of the data in question as the true
equation is only known to GOD and hence
rightly said "All models are wrong,
some are useful!" 6 .
