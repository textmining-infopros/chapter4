ABSTRACT
The paper analyses the growth and publications size of the Indian publications in
materials science during 1993-2001. It also analyses various other features of publications
output such as modes of communication, areas of research priority, research quality,
nature of collaboration, and institutional productivity.
Keywords: Materials science, scientometric analysis, publications size

1. INTRODUCTON
Materials science has been defined variantly
in the literature. According to the 1974 summary
report of the Committee on the Survey of
Materials Science and Engineering (COSMAT)
of the United States National Academy of
Sciences, the materials science has been
defined as a multidisciplinary field concerned
with the fundamental nature of materials
and their applications, with the generations
and application of knowledge relating to the
composition, structure, and processing of
materials to their properties and uses. This
definition recognises three basic elements
in the study of materials: structure, composition,
and processing and properties. The Committee
on Materials Science and Engineering of

the National Research Council in its report,
Materials science and engineering for the
1990s: Maintaining competitiveness in the
age of Materials, provided another definition
in which it added the fourth element–performance.
According to this report, materials science
is defined as the study of materials for controlling
the four basic elements–properties; structure
and composition; synthesis and processing;
and performance, and understanding the strong
interrelationships among them.
Materials science is synonymous with
new and advanced materials. This new discipline
has given rise to several new materials for
weight reduction, optimal utilisation of energy,
cost reduction, and greater efficiency. Their
applications in computers, automobiles,
69

communication equipment, structural products,
etc. have radically altered the quality of our
life in many ways; new appliances are lighter
and efficient, automobiles and aeroplanes
are using less fuel and going faster. Materials
science is now offering advanced materials
by exercising control over the structure of
material even at nano, micro, and macro
scales. Such materials are able to meet the
stringent performance requirement imposed
by most modern technologies such as supersonic
aircraft, space vehicles, etc. Industries such
as aerospace, automobiles, biomaterials,
chemicals, electronics, energy, metals,
communications are still looking for new
improved and more economical materials
and processes for meeting their critical needs.
The economic and strategic impact of such
developments on the society has been so
profound that materials science has come
to be recognised as an independent discipline
in itself. The field continues to expand its
knowledge base for breakthrough in structural
materials, electronics materials, magnetic
materials, photonic materials, super conducting
materials, and biomaterials.
Even information technology owes a great
deal of its tremendous developments to advances
in materials science. It has led to the development
of electronic and optical materials without
which large-scale integration and fibre optic
communication would not have become possible.
Prof C N R Rao, one of the leading science
policy makers of India considers the use of
advanced technology materials as an index
of development. Such has been its contribution
to the society that materials science is now
recognised as a subject of special importance.
India has a long tradition of working in
the field of materials science. A number of
institutions including academic, institutes
of national importance, R&D sector, and industry
are actively pursuing research on different
aspects of materials science. For example,
in the area of metals and alloys, several
institutes such as Defence Metallurgical
Research Laboratory (DMRL), Hyderabad;
Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore;
Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB),
Mumbai; Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC),
70

Trivandrum; Bhabha Atomic Research Research
Centre (BARC), Mumbai; MIDHANI, Hyderabad;
National Metallurgical Laboratory (NML),
Jamshedpur; and IDPL Chemicals Limited,
Hyderabad are engaged in R&D work. Similarly
in area like polymers, some of the institute
engaged in R&D work are National Chemical
Laboratory (NCL), Pune; Indian Institute of
Technology Bombay (IITB), Mumbai and New
Delhi; Central Leather Research Institute
(CLRI), Chennai; etc. Most of the funding
in materials science to various institutions
in India comes from parents bodies as well
as from extramural funding schemes of various
government agencies/departments.
In the past, only few evaluation studies

have been conducted in India.
et Kochar,
al.
has
analysed research output from Indian institutions
in seven categories of materials, viz., metals
and alloys, aluminium, ceramics, composites,
glass, polymers, and wood based on the
database developed by INSDOC through funding
from TIFAC during 1980-89. Mohan 2, et al.
studied the international collaborative papers
of Indian scientists during 1995-99 as covered
by Materials Science Citation Index.

2. OBJECTIVES
The objective of this paper is to study
the R&D output from Indian institutions in
the area of materials science during 19932001 with focus on growth and development,
quality of research, institutional productivity
and quality, collaborative profile, subject areas
of priority, mode of communication, etc.

3. METHODOLOGY AND
SOURCES USED
The results presented in the study are
based on raw bibliographical publication data
(along with their citations data) for the period
1993-2001 extracted and downloaded in February
2004 from the Science Citation Index–Expanded
Version (SCIE) of the Thomson-ISI. The
delineation of the broad and narrow subject
areas in research publications was based
on a set of journals assigned by the ThomsonISI to relevant subject categories. A number
of absolute and relative indices were used

for analysing performance of research in materials
science in India.

4.2 Growth Rate
The country has achieved an average
growth rate of 7.09 per cent annually in the
materials science research during 1993-2001,
which marginally increased to 7.61 per cent
during 1997-2001. It is evident that materials
science research in the country is growing
steadily. At sub-field level, average publications
growth rate annually is much higher, ranging
between 10.4 per cent and 242.5 per cent;
the lowest being 10.4 per cent for ceramics
and the highest being 242.5 per cent for
textile (Table 2). The relatively higher growth
rate of the country as seen at the sub-field
levels in materials science compared to its
7.09 per cent growth rate as well as wide
just 2.82 per cent rise. Comparing growth
rate on cumulative data of three years, textile

4. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
4.1 Publications Size
Publications data derived from the Web
of Science revealed that India published 9545
papers in materials science during 19932001. At sub-field level their distribution shows
wide variations. For example, multidisciplinary
science accounts for the largest share (76.6
per cent) in the total country output in materials
science, followed by ceramics (5.76 per cent),
textile (4.27 per cent), coatings and films
(4.06 per cent), materials characterisation
and testing (3.03 per cent), biomaterials
(1.48 per cent), and wood (0.68 per cent)
(Table 1).

has been the fastest growing area in materials
science witnessing 267.2 per cent growth
during 1993-95 to 1999-2001 followed by
composites (120.6 per cent), biomaterials
(97 per cent), coating and films (91.5 per
cent), materials characterisation and testing
(90 per cent), and multidisciplinary areas
(29 per cent). In wood research, the country
showed decline 28.5 per cent in its publications
growth during the same period (Table 3).

4.3 Sub-field-Wise Analysis
Publications activity of the country in
materials science was studied sub-field wise
to examine and compare to what extent its
publications size in each sub-field under
different periods of study is comparable with
its overall publications size in materials science.
In this, data was computed for measuring
publications activity index. It is a relative
measure and its average value is taken as
one. The value of activity index, if more than
one, indicates that the publications activity
in the respective sub-fields is above the
country average. For value of activity index
less than one, it indicates that the publications
activity in the respective sub-field is below
the country average.
The publications activity in multidisciplinary
science, though has been as rising at 29
per cent sexennially, but compared to the
publications activity in materials science it
has been declining gradually from 1.05 in
1993-95 to 1.02 in 1996-98, and to 0.94 in
1999-2001. The publications activity in wood
compared to national average in materials
science has also been declining gradually,
from 1.57 in 1993-95 to 0.79 in 1996-98, and
to 0.78 in 1999-2001. In all other subjects,
publications activity has been gradually rising.

The same trend is also reflected by the
growth rate in publications output in these
sub-fields (Table 4).

4.4 Media of Communications
Indian scientists published papers in
materials science in 108 journals (both Indian
and foreign) during 1993-2001. Of these, the
top 10 journals accounted for 58.79 per cent
papers, top 20 journals for 76.93 per cent,
top 30 journals for 85.52 per cent, and top
40 for 90.94 per cent papers of the total
output in materials science. It implies that
the country output in materials science is
highly scattered in nearly 68 journals. The
list of top 20 journals publishing India's papers
in materials science are given in Table 5.

4.5 Impact of India's
Publications Output in
Materials Science
The average impact factor (IF) per paper
for the country output in materials science
is not high (0.638) since nearly 91.74 per
cent of its output is published in low impact
journals (IF=0.001–1.999), and 2.7 per cent
output in zero impact journals. Its output
appearing in medium IF journals (IF=2.000–
3.999) and high impact journals (IF=4 and
more) is not very significant (3.57 per cent
and 1.58 per cent, respectively). This trend
is uniform across all sub-fields in materials
science. However, the quality of research
output in materials science is showing marginal
rise with time. Comparing the publications
share of the country in different categories
of journals during 1993-95 and 1999-200, it
was seen that the country’s share in zero
impact and low impact journals have declined

from 94.24 per cent to 91.74 per cent, respectively,
whereas its share in medium and high impact
journals have shown marginal rise from 2.44
per cent to 3.57 per cent and from and 0.34
per cent to 1.98 per cent, respectively. This
indicates that the quality of research in materials
science has marginally increased over the
years (Table 6). On analysing the average
IF for papers in different sub-fields of materials
science during 1993-2001, it was found that

multidisciplinary materials science (0.91),
ceramics (0.90), composites (0.45), wood
(0.33), characterisation and testing (0.30),
and textiles (0.21). In most of the sub-fields
the average impact factor per paper have
increased during 1993-95 to 1999-2001. The
maximum increase (from 0.70 to 1.15) in IF
per paper was reported in case of multidisciplinary
materials science followed by wood (from
0.18 to 0.44), biomaterials (from 0.84 to

(from 0.83 to 0.97), etc. (Table 7).

the rise in collaborative research at international
level from 132 to 565 papers (4.65 per cent
to 14.99 per cent) during 1993-95 to 19992001. The collaboration through bilateral
participation was greater (859 papers, 88.37
per cent) then collaboration through multilateral
participation (113 papers, 11.62 per cent).
However, bilateral research showed decline
(from 94.26 per cent to 86.72 per cent) and
multilateral research showed rise (from 5.74
per cent to 13.27 per cent) during 1993-1995
to 1999-2001 (Table 9).The collaborative share
of research, as seen from the number of
publications, was the largest (37.62 per cent)
in coatings, followed by composites (34.31
per cent), multidisciplinary materials science
(31.45 per cent), biomaterials science (27.66
per cent), etc. The collaborative share at
national level was the largest (27.39 per
cent) in composites followed by coatings
(22.84 per cent), multidisciplinary materials
science (22.64 per cent), textiles (20.83 per
cent), etc. The collaborative share at international
level was the largest in coatings (18.04 per

4.6 Collaborative Profile in
Materials Science
Of the total 9545 papers reported by
India in materials science during 1993-2001,
2910 (30.48 per cent) were through collaborative
research. The country showed significant
rise in collaborative papers from 346 (13.2
per cent) to 1620 (42.9 per cent) during
1993-1995 to 1999-2001. The rise in collaborative
research output (368.2 per cent) was greater
than the rise in country’s output in materials
science research (7.09 per cent) during the
corresponding period (Table 8). Of the total
9545 papers in materials science, 2101 (22
per cent) were through collaborative research
at national level and 972 (10.2 per cent)
through collaborative research at international
level. The rise in collaborative research at
national level was higher from 236 to 1152
papers (9.0 per cent to 30.56 per cent) than

4.7 Institutional Productivity and
Quality
A total of 933 institutions belonging to
academic and mission-oriented research in
the country participated in materials research
during 1993-2001. Of these, top 83 institutions
accounted for 80 per cent research output
and the remaining 850 for just 20 per cent

research output (Table 10). It implies that
the pockets of excellence in materials science
research are highly localised.
Of the top 20 institutions, 12 were academic
institutions (IISc Bangalore; IIT Kharagpur,
Chennai, Mumbai, Kanpur, Delhi; SHIVUK;
BANAUV; COLL-IT-VA; ANNAUM; Delhi
University, Delhi; and RRL,Thiruvanthapuram)
and eight mission-oriented institutions (BARC,
IGCAR, DMRL, IACS, CGCRI, NPL, NCL,
and CERI).

5. CONCLUSION
As seen from publications data in the
Web of Science, materials science research
in the country is not stagnant, but growing
steadily at about seven per cent per year.
Currently, the publications activity is the
fastest in composites followed by textiles,
biomaterials, coating and films, and ceramics.
In wood science, the publications activity is
below the country average. The research
institutions publish mainly in low impact
journals and very little in high impact journals.
It is for this reason that the average impact
per paper of the country in materials science
is low. The collaborative research is growing
faster (368.2 per cent) than the country growth
in materials science research (7.09 per cent).
The bilateral participation in materials science

research is greater (88.37 per cent) than
collaboration through multilateral participation
(11.62 per cent). The pockets of excellence
are localised to select few institutions out
of 933 institutions, which participated in materials
science research during 1993-2001.
