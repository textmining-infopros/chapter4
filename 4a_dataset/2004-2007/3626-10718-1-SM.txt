Reflected in Co-authored Papers 
B M Gupta & Mohinder Singh 
Abstract 
India’s relations with the Latin American countries have been traditionally friendly  and interaction with them is close both at bilateral and multilateral level.  India’s collaboration with Latin American countries has resulted in different kinds of outputs, including joint publications, technology development, technology transfer, improvised products and processes. The joint research output emanating out of research collaboration is an important source of information for mapping India’s collaboration with Latin America, and its impact on different fields. This paper attempts to study the research collaboration of India with Latin America, with the following objectives: (i) To study the nature of Indian collaboration with Latin American countries in S&T, as reflected in co-authored research papers, (ii) To identify the specific subject areas of Indian collaboration with Latin America, (iii) To study the impact of Indian collaborative research with Latin America in different fields, and (iv) To identify the major Indian institutions involved in this collaborative research with institutions in Latin America. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
India’s relations with the Latin American countries (LAC) have been traditionally friendly and interaction with them is close both at bilateral and multilateral level. High-level visits complemented by official and exchange visits have further cemented India’s  relations with the region. In the economic field  a concentrated effort has been made to enhance bilateral co-operation. As a result, India has trade and economic agreements with seven Latin American countries and has set up ‘joint business councils’ with some other countries of the region. In continuation of her ‘Focus LAC’ Programme, Indian exhibitions and joint seminars are organised to discuss and explore the potential of mutual interactions. India enjoys considerable goodwill in the LAC region. At the institutional level, there are cultural, educational and scientific exchange programmes that provide the framework for meaningful co-operation 
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2004, 24(3) 
and interaction between academicians, scholars and scientists. India also provides technical assistance under its ITEC programme to several countries of the region. 
2. S&T COLLABORATION 
BETWEEN INDIA AND LATIN 
AMERICA  
The environment surrounding science and technology world over is changing rapidly with  the emergence of a new world economic order, and which is based on competition, co-operation, and globalisation. The international co-operation is becoming an important policy. Recognising the importance of international co-operation in science and technology, the Government of India had started collaboration in scientific and technological fields both at bilateral and multilateral levels with number of developed and developing countries.

Such international collaborations help in the development of science and technology capabilities of both the participating countries in one way or the other. There is a wide scope  of collaboration between India and Latin American countries, whereby the participating  countries can mutually share each other’s expertise in the S&T knowledge-base. At present, India’s collaboration with Latin America is being undertaken through bilateral and multilateral agreements in science and technology1. Among bilateral collaborations, India and Latin America have taken few initiatives, which are described below. They are also participating in a number of multilateral projects undertaken under the umbrella of international co-operation, through United Nations agencies, such as UNESCO, ILO, WHO, UNEP, FAO, UNIDO, IAEA and the World Bank. 
2.1 
India’s Collaboration Agreements with Latin America in S&T 
The Indian government has established formal co-operative relationships in S&T with Latin American countries in the form of agreements or some other arrangements1, as described below: 
(a) Brazil—An Indo-Brazil Committee was 
established in 1997 in pursuance of the 
Indo-Brazil Agreement on co-operation in 
the fields of science and technology signed 
in July 1985, and the Agenda on S&T 
co-operation, signed in January 1996. A 
series of joint workshops have been 
organised to evolve joint programs in the 
area of climate research and health 
sciences. In addition, a number of other 
MoUs and agreements have been signed 
between the two countries, some of them 
are: 
q ICAR and EMBRAPA for co-operation in the 
field of Agriculture, signed in August 1995 at  
Brasilia. 
q India-Brazil Common Agenda for 
Environment, signed on 27 January 1996 at 
New Delhi. 
10 
q 
Bilateral agreement in the area of Health 
and Medicine, signed on 6 May 1998 at 
Brasilia 
q Ministry of Science & Technology, Brazil 
and Ministry of Information Technology, 
India, on collaboration in information 
technology services and setting up a Task 
force on information technology, signed on 
11 September 2000 at Brasilia 
q Co-operation in Space between Brazilian 
Space Agency and Indian Space Research 
Organization in the peaceful uses of outer 
space, signed on 1 March 2002 at 
Bangalore, and 
q Academic exchange and co-operation 
between Goa University and the Federal 
University of Rio de Janeiro.  
A delegation led by the Prof. Murali Manohar Joshi, Indian Minister of Science and Technology, Government of India, had visited Brazil in July 2001, when a MoU was signed with the Brazilian counterpart on 5 July  2001.  The areas covered in this MoU include biotechnology, bioinformatics, human health, climate research, renewable energy, space sciences, marine sciences, new materials and  industry-research partnership. Subsequently, India-Brazil Science Council and a Programme Management Board, with six members from each side, were set up in 2002. The first meeting of this Council was organised in New Delhi, at which future perspectives on S&T co-operation between the two countries were discussed and a few projects were identified for joint implementation during the next two years.   (b) Mexico— An agreement for co-operation in  
the fields of S & T between the Government 
of India and the Government of the United 
Mexican States was signed in July 1975. 
This programme of co-operation continued 
and was renewed in 2000 for a period of 
three years, up to 2003. The areas 
identified for co-operation under this 
programme were: atmospheric sciences, 
physical sciences, geosciences, 
seismology, chemical sciences, new 
materials, computer science and 
biotechnology. The collaboration is going 
on through the following modalities: (i) joint 
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2004, 24(3) 

========2========

research and development projects, (ii) exchange of specialists, and (iii) organisation of joint symposia, conferences and workshops. Under this collaboration, three joint R&D projects have  been carried out between: 
q University of Hyderabad and  Universidad 
Metropolitana – Izataapalapa, 
q Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and 
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, and 
q Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore 
and its counterpart in Mexico.  
(c) Cuba—An Indian S&T delegation led by 
the Secretary, Department of Science and 
Technology, Government of India, had 
visited Cuba for the first meeting of the 
Indo-Cuban Joint Committee on S&T, set 
up earlier, in the last week of September 
1999. A new protocol on co-operation was 
concluded with Cuba for the period 
1999-2000, which envisaged the 
organisation of two joint workshops and 
initiation/continuation of 10 joint projects. 
Under the Indian ITEC and other 
programmes, about 100 Cuban officials, 
engineers and scientists have visited India. 
Four sessions were held of the Indo-Cuban 
Joint Commission up to 2000 and these 
have led to active co-operation in the field of  
agricultural research, non-conventional 
sources of energy, and some other areas of 
S&T. An Indo-Cuban Interaction in 
Biotechnology was also held during 3-5 
October 2000 in India.  
(d) Peru—The Peruvian President Fujimori 
visited India in 1997 and President of India,  
Dr. K.R. Narayanan visited Peru in 1998. 
During their visits a number of bilateral 
co-operation agreements were signed 
between the two countries in the area of 
Antarctic exploration, agricultural research,  
space research, and software 
development. India also offered 
scholarships for technical training to 
Peruvian students under its ITEC Program. 
Indian and Peruvian scientists have already  
participated in each other’s Antarctic 
expeditions. There had also been bilateral 
visits for joint research in the fields of 
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2004, 24(3) 
agriculture, space technology, and other 
high technology areas. 
(e) Columbia—The President of Columbia 
Andres Pastrana Araugo visited India in 
March 2001. At that time, India had 
announced the technical 
training/assistance to be given to Columbia 
in the area of human resource development  
in IT, provision of experts, and supply of a 
solar energy unit. The Minister for 
Communications & Information 
Technology, Promod Mahajan, visited 
Columbia from 31 March 2002 to 3 April 
2002. During his visit, a MoU on bilateral 
co-operation in the field of IT was signed 
between the two countries.  
(f) Argentina—In pursuance of the S&T 
agreements signed between the India and 
Argentina, a two member scientific 
delegation from India had visited Argentina 
in October 1995. A Programme of 
co-operation in the fields of Agriculture and 
Biotechnology was worked out during the 
visit. 
(g) Venezuela—The University of Los Andes 
had signed a MoU with Jawaharlal Nehru 
University for exchange of scholars in 
1999. The Venezuelan Ministers of 
Education and Science and Technology 
had visited India in March 2001. He 
proposed collaboration with India in the use  
of IT, biotechnology, etc. The Indian 
government provides five scholarships to 
Venezuelans every year for training in 
India. Ayurveda is becoming popular in 
Venezuela. There is a proposal for setting a 
joint Ayurvedic Center in Caracas in the 
near future. 
2.2 Tangible Outputs from S&T 
Collaborations 
India’s collaboration with Latin American countries has resulted in different kinds of outputs, including joint publications, technology development, technology transfer,  improvised products and processes. The joint research output emanating out of research collaboration is an important source of information for mapping India’s collaboration with Latin America, and its impact on different  
11 

========3========

fields. The present paper makes an assessment in this direction, using the data on joint publications emanating from India’s collaboration with Latin American countries. 
Some studies have been undertaken in the  past on the collaborative linkages of Indian science, using publication data from Science Citation Index (SCI). The study by Nagpaul2 was focused on the analysis of transnational linkages of Indian science in eleven scientific fields, with 35 most significant partner countries during 1990 and 1994. The author in collaboration with his colleagues3-7  has conducted a number of studies analysing India’s collaborative linkages, both at bilateral and multilateral level, with Russia, South Asia, South East Asian countries, China, and Australia. The present study also looks at the India’s collaboration linkages with Latin American countries. 
3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 
The focus of this paper is on the study of research collaboration of India with Latin America, with the following objectives: (i) To study the nature of Indian collaboration with Latin American countries in S&T, as reflected in co-authored research papers, (ii) To identify  the specific subject areas of Indian collaboration with Latin America, (iii) To study the impact of Indian collaborative research with Latin America in different fields, and (iv) To identify the major Indian institutions involved in this collaborative research with institutions in Latin America. 
4.DATABASE AND METHODOLOGY 
The data for the study was derived from the CD-ROM version of the international database, Science Citation Index (SCI), for a period of five years from 1996 to 2000. This database covers around 4000 significant journals of the world in all major fields of science and technology. The journals covered  by SCI represent the mainstream science. As a result, this study is restricted to co-authored  articles generated from India’s collaboration with Latin America and published in refereed international journals. The classification of articles has been made in 10 major disciplines and 61 sub-disciplines, according 
12 
to a scheme suggested by Computer Horizon Inc. (CHI), USA. Here each article is classified  into a main discipline and sub-discipline using  the subject classification of the journal in which it is published. 
Scientific collaboration was measured through co-authorship of articles, which signify a formal acknowledgement of the joint research. The nature of collaboration, as reflected in the addresses of the authors in a research paper was defined as bilateral and multilateral, depending upon the number of countries participating in it. A research paper was considered to indicate a: (i) bilateral collaboration, when there was a participation of India along with a Latin American country, and (ii) multilateral collaboration, when there was a participation of two or more countries, including India and Latin American countries. 
5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
5.1 S&T Research Output of India 
and Latin American Countries 
Before studying the status of India’s collaboration in S&T with Latin American countries, let us have a look at the S&T research output of India and individual Latin American countries, as reflected in the SCI for  the period 1991-93 to 2000-02, as shown in Table 1. 
It is evident from Table 1 that there existed  a wide gap between the average research output of India and Latin American countries. There is a systematic increase in the research  output of most of the India and Latin American countries from 1991-93 to 2000-02, except Guatemala and Honduras.  
5.2 Research Priorities 
The priority areas of research in India, as well as some Latin American countries8, as reflected in the publications output of SCI during 1995-97, were as follows:  
(i) India—Chemistry (27.3%), Physics 
(20.2%), Biomedical Research (13.6%), 
Clinical Medicine (12.3%), and Engineering  
& Technology (11.1%); 
(ii) Mexico— Physics (21.0%), Clinical 
Medicine (20.2%), Biology (14.8%),

in 1986-88 to 15.7% in 1995-97 
8. As against this, the share of international co-authored papers of Latin American countries in their total research output was very high. The country-wise increase of the share of internationally collaborative papers from 1986-88 to 1995-97 was as follows: Brazil—from 28.3% to 41.1%; Mexico—from 30.3% to 42.8%; Chile—from 29.7% to 45.8%; Argentina—from 15.0% to 32.5%; Venezuela—from 33.1% to 45.5%; and Cuba—from 50.7% to 57.5%8. 
The number of India’s collaborative partners has increased from 84 countries in 1986-88 to 109 countries in 1995-97, as reflected in the co-authored papers. As against this, the number of collaborative partners of the Latin American Countries, as seen in co-authored papers, has increased from 66 to 114 for Brazil; 54 to 89 for Mexico; 47 to 77 for Argentina; 42 to 76 for Chile; 37 to 60 for Venezuela; and 29 to 56 for Cuba8. 
7. INDIA’S COLLABORATION IN 
S&T WITH LATIN AMERICA 
India’s collaboration in S & T with Latin American countries in general has been increasing over the years.  The increase in the share of the Latin American countries in India’s co-authored papers from 1986-88 to 1995-97 was as follows; Brazil—from 0.6% to 
13 

========5========

2.9%, Mexico—from 0.3% to 1.4%, Argentina-   from 0.1% to 0.2%, Chile—from 0.1% to 0.2%, and Venezuela—from 0.1% to 0%.  As against this, the priority assigned to India in co-authored papers of Latin American countries has increased in Brazil—from 0.9% to 1.6%, Mexico—from 0.7% to 2.1%, Argentina—from 0.6 to 1.2%, Chile—from 0.3% to 0.5%, but decreased in Venezuela—from 0.6% to 0.1% and Cuba —from 0.7% to 0.3%. 
7.1 Distribution of S&T Papers  (a) By type of collaboration 
As a result of collaboration between Indian  and Latin American Scientists, 389 joint co-authored papers in S&T were published as  per SCI database from 1996 to 2000.  
Thus, on an average there were 78 co-authored publications per year. These collaborations have also depicted in increasing trend over these years, from 53 co-authored papers in 1996 to 100 in 2000 (Table 2).

Of the 389 total co-authored papers, only 116 papers (29.82%) were bilateral in nature, i.e., those involved the participation of Indian and any one Latin American country.   
The remaining 273 papers (70.28%) were multilateral in nature, i.e., involved the participation of more than two countries, one Indian and one Latin American and at least one other country (Table 3).

In the 389 joint co-authored papers, India’s  collaboration with Latin American countries was as follows: India - Brazil (229 papers), India - Mexico (179 papers), India - Argentina (96 papers), India - Columbia (83 papers), India - Chile (38 papers), India - Ecuador (23 papers), India - Venezuela (14 papers), India -  Peru (9 papers), India - Cuba (6 papers), India - Guatemala (5 papers), India - Costa Rica (5 papers), India - Honduras (1 paper) and India - Cote Ivory (1 paper) (Table 3). The  total number of joint co-authored papers (Table 3) under these 13 categories is 689 instead of 389 co-authored papers.  This is because of the fact that in many multilateral co-authored papers, India has collaboration with more than 2 Latin American countries simultaneously.  
Except for Brazil and Mexico, a strong multilateral collaboration was found to exist between India and 12 other Latin American countries’ scientists. Under India-Brazil and India-Mexico collaborations, the shares of bilateral co-authored papers were only 21.83% and 29.61% of the total co-authored papers (Table 3). 
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2004, 24(3) 

========6========

(b) Distribution by subject 
The distribution of 389 co-authored papers  under ten broad subjects was highly uneven. Physics had the largest share with 189 papers (48.58%), followed by Clinical Medicine (60  papers,  15.42%), and Earth & Space Sciences (49 papers, 12.59%). Six broad subjects each contributing less than 10 per cent to the total output were: Chemistry (29 papers, 7.45%), Biomedical Research (28  papers, 7.20%), Biology (13 papers, 3.34%), Engineering and Technology (8 papers, 2.06%), and Mathematics (3 papers, 0.77%) (Table 4). 
Among these broad subjects, bilateral collaborations had larger share in three subjects, namely Engineering & Technology (87.5%), Chemistry (68.96%), and Mathematics (66.66%), while in other broad subjects, multilateral collaborations had major  share: Clinical Medicine (96.66%), Earth & Space Science (73.47%), Biomedical Research (71.43%), Physics (69.84%), and Biology (69.23%) (Table 5). 
India’s collaboration with Brazil and Mexico in S&T in particular was more widespread and covered almost all broad disciplines, while its collaborative efforts with other Latin America countries were very 
narrow and focused only in a few disciplines (Table 5). 
Physics accounted for largest share of India’s collaborative research with Ecuador (95.65%), followed by Columbia (91.57%), Argentina (82.29%), Mexico (64.25%), Brazil (63.32%), and Venezuela (57.14%). Clinical Medicine accounted for India’s largest share in collaborative publications with Guatemala (60%), Cuba (50%), Peru (44.44%), Chile (42.10%), and Costa Rica (40%) and third largest with Brazil (10.04%), and Mexico (8.38%). Chemistry accounted for second largest share in India’s collaborative research with Mexico (10.05%) and third largest share with Chile (10.52%). Biomedical Research accounted for second largest share in India’s collaborative research with Guatemala (40%),  Venezuela (35.71%), Peru (33.33%) and Columbia (6.02%) and fourth largest share with Brazil (6.11%). Biology accounted for second largest priority area under India’s collaborative research with Argentina (4.16%). 
7.2 Bilateral S&T Collaborations 
India’s bilateral collaborations with Latin American countries resulted in 116 co-authored papers from 1996 to 2000.  The

7.3.1 Priority of Subject Areas and 
Their Impact Under Multilateral 
Collaboration 
The largest number of joint co-authored papers was published in Physics (132 papers)  followed by Clinical Medicine (58 papers) Earth & Space Sciences (36 papers) and Biomedical Research (20 papers). The 132 multilateral co-authored papers in Physics were spread in 6 sub-disciplines, viz. general physics (61 papers), nuclear & particle physics (48 papers), applied physics (14 papers), chemical physics (4 papers), solid-state physics (3 papers), and optics (2 papers).  The 58 papers in Clinical Medicine were in 19 sub-disciplines, with focus on general & internal medicine (15 papers), environment & occupational health (6 papers), cardiovascular system (5 papers), fertility (5 papers), immunology (4 papers) and  neurology & neurosurgery (4 papers).  The 36  papers in Earth & Space Sciences were in three sub-disciplines, with focus on astronomy & planetary sciences (12 papers). The 20 papers in Biomedical Research were in eight sub-disciplines, with focus on genetics & heredity (5 papers), microbiology (4 papers), biomedical engineering (3 papers)  and virology (3 papers). 
The average value of IF per paper in multilateral papers was 3.68, much higher than that of bilateral collaborative papers. The  papers (7) through India - Peru collaboration have received the highest value of IF (5.18), followed by India - Columbia (5.08), India- Ecuador (4.95), India - Argentina (4.79), India- Mexico (4.22), India - Venezuela (3.85),  India - Brazil (3.76), India - Chile (3.61), India-  Honduras (3.26), India - Guatemala (2.68), India - Cuba (2.19), collaborations. 
7.3.2 Number of Countries 
Participating per Paper in 
Multilateral Collaborations  
A total of 87 countries participated in multilateral collaborated papers, among which  74 countries were from outside Latin America.  These countries participated in various combinations, ranging  from 3 to 28.  Around 48 per cent of the multilateral collaborative 
20 
papers emanated from the team efforts of three to five countries.  The participating teams comprising 11 to 28 countries accounted for only 15 per cent of the total multilateral papers.  Among 74 countries participating outside Latin America, the largest participation was from the USA (185 papers), followed by France (112 papers), Russia (82 papers), South Korea (70 papers),  the UK (69 papers), Poland (64 papers), China (50 papers), Italy (34 papers), Germany (38 papers), and Australia (31 papers). 
7.3.3 Institutional Participation per 
Paper in Multilateral Papers  
The number of institutions collaborating per paper from various participating countries in multilateral papers ranged from 3 to 50.  The participation of three to five institutions was in 38 per cent of the total papers.  On the  other hand, participation of 11 to 43 institutions accounted for 20.51 per cent of all  papers, while in 53 papers, the number of participating institutions varied from 44 to 50. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A study on India’s S&T collaboration with Latin America countries has been presented through the analysis of joint co-authored research papers published during 1996-2000 in journals covered by SCI. As an outcome of these collaborations, a total of 389 joint co-authored papers were published in which 116 papers were under bilateral collaborations and 273 under multilateral collaborations. India’s most significant collaborative partners along with their co-authored out put were Brazil (229 papers), Mexico (179 papers), Argentina (96 papers), Columbia (83 papers), Chile (38 papers), Ecudor (23 papers), Venezuela (14 papers), and Peru (9 papers). Except for Brazil and Mexico a very strong multilateral collaboration  exists between India and 12 other Latin American countries. The most preferred and dominant areas of collaboration have been found to be Physics, Clinical Medicine and Earth  & Space Sciences contributing together  more 75 percent of the India’s collaborative output with Latin America countries.
