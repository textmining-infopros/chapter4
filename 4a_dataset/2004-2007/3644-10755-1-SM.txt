B.M. Gupta & S.M. Dhawan 
Abstract 
Computer science is of central importance to India for its impact on the national economy and society at large, and its role in shaping India as a technology superpower. This paper analyses the status of computer science research in India in terms of publication output, its areas of strength and weakness, and the leading institutions and individual scholars involved in computer science research  
in the country. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Over the years, India has emerged as a major information technology (IT) force in the world. There is a strong national, political, and  administrative commitment to IT as a priority sector. Realizing the special importance of IT, the Prime Minister of India gave a call to make India an IT superpower in the world within next ten years. As an initiating step in this regard, a high-powered National Task Force on Information Technology and Software Development was set up by the Prime Minister’s Office on May 22, 1998, under the Chairmanship of the Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission. This taskforce formulated the draft National Informatics Policy. It addressed several different issues such as national information infrastructure, IT driven governance, IT education especially at college and secondary  school level, information content on internet, laws and regulations for cyberspace, IT research & development, and IT manpower development, etc.  The taskforce had set a vision of software export of around US$50 billion by 2008 from the level of US$1.75 billion during 1997-98.1

Computer revolution in India, which made modest beginnings with Homi Bhabha in TIFR  in the 50’s, took firm roots after the 60’s with institutions like IIT Kanpur starting undergraduate and postgraduate programme in computer science.2  Since then, India has come to establish a strong infrastructure both for teaching and research in computer science. The number of colleges and university departments teaching computer science at the graduate, post-graduate level and Ph.D. level is fast increasing. At present, India is producing 60,000 computer professionals through formal mode of computer education such as   B.Tech/M.Tech/ MCA, etc. Over the years a massive system of non-formal education in computers has since emerged in the private sector, with institutions like NIIT, APTEC, taking the lead. India needs to considerably enhance the production of skilled manpower in the field of IT to develop capabilities to achieve the target  of US$50 billion towards software exports. For this purpose, around one million professionals have to be produced in India in the next few years in this area.1  The graduate  and postgraduate students from India’s educational institutions are fast getting

absorbed in the industrial sector on high salaries and are also sought after in US and Europe. A large number of Indian students are also going abroad for higher studies and to get absorbed in different countries after completing their studies in this area.3 
A large number of institutes and firms from  academic sector, R&D sector, government sector and private sector are involved in computer science research with support of government funds. These organisations are involved in a wide breadth of research problems under all major areas of computer science. These include topics such as: multi-media, workflow automation, virtual reality, and hardware-software co-design. Most of the research problems tackled are of current interest globally. Some of the research  efforts have even attracted international attention, including work on neuro-fuzzy systems, machine learning, genetic and neural algorithms, the modeling and control of  flexible systems, speech synthesis, databases and complex theory.3-4 
Besides spending a considerable amount of money on infrastructure development and R&D activities on their own, these organisations are also getting enormous funds by way of extramural support from several government R&D agencies, including Ministry of Information Technology (MOIT), Department of Electronics (DoE), Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), Department of Space (DoS), All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), Ministry of Human Resource Development and University Grants Commission (UGC).  
Indian computer industry has seen a tremendous growth during the last 10 years. A  large number of Indian firms have established  IT services and have been involved in R&D work and are contributing substantially to national GDP. The three big IT companies in India, which started their businesses in the 60’s and 70’s, are Tata Consultancy Service, Infosys and Wipro. The exit of IBM in the 70’s had indeed provided a challenge to the Indian  IT industry and the industry did rise to the occasion. MNC’s are also looking to India in a  
4 
big way, and are making huge investments to set up R&D centres in the country. A lot of them are carrying out a significant proportion of their R&D work in India, and hence contributing to overall growth and success. The big global IT companies such as Oracle, IBM, SAP, Philips, Texas Instruments, etc., have already established their development centres in India. Some of them are even collaborating with academic institutions in India for education and research.

Evidently, computer science is of central importance to India for its role and impact on the national economy and society at large, and in giving India a leading edge in emerging as a technology superpower. The national IT policy and funding support at governmental level in this area should help catalyze computer science manpower of high caliber for research in the country. This paper presents the status of computer science research in India in terms of publications output, its areas of strength and weakness, and the leading institutions and individual scholars involved in computer science research in the country. Amongst the earlier studies in this area, Das and Kranjai6 conducted a study based on 1408 papers published by Indian scientists in international journals on computer sciences from 1991 to 2000, using Science Citation Index (SCI)  as a  base. This study was restricted to only developing a rank list of organisations conducting research and contributing research papers in this area.  
2. DATA SOURCE 
Data on publications in computer science from India pertaining to the period 1994-2001 were downloaded from the INSPEC database. It is the most comprehensive and leading bibliographic database providing access to the world’s scientific and technical literature in physics, electrical engineering, electronics, communications, control engineering, computers and computing, and information technology. The Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEE) scans  over 3500 national and international S&T journals and some 1500 conference proceedings/seminars, and numerous other 
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2005, 25(1) 

========2========

publications each year for inclusion in its database. This database now contains over seven million bibliographic records and is growing at the rate of 350,000 records per year. 
The  ‘Computer and Control’ Section under the INSPEC database has seven main fields and 23 subfields. The main fields (along with the subfields) are: 
(a) General and management topics (General 
control topics, general computer topics, 
and management topics)  
(b) Systems and control theory (Mathematical 
techniques, systems theory and 
cybernetics, and control theory) 
(c) Control technology (Control and 
measurement of specific variables, control 
equipment and instrumentation, and 
control applications) 
(d) Numerical analysis & theoretical computer 
topics (Numerical analysis and computer 
theory) 
(e) Computer hardware (Circuits and devices,  
logic design and digital techniques, 
computer storage equipment and 
techniques, analogue and digital 
computers & systems, Computer 
peripheral equipment, and  data 
communication equipment & techniques) (f) Computer software (Software techniques 
and systems) 
(g) Computer applications (Business & 
administration, information science & 
documentation, natural sciences 
computing, engineering computing, and 
other computer applications).  
The study quantified the impact of research in computer science in terms of three indices:  
(i) Percentage share of country output in 
SCI-covered journals,  
(ii) Percentage share of papers in high impact 
journals (IF = 1.5 or more) and low impact 
journals (IF  = 0.5 or less), and  
(iii) The average impact per paper.

3. RESULTS 
3.1 Publication Dynamics and 
Communication Pattern 
The research output, as reflected in INSPEC-database, revealed that Indian scholars published 4690 papers in computer science during 1994 to 2001. Of these, 3143 papers (67%) had appeared in journals and the rest 1547 (33%) in conference/seminar proceedings. Of the journal papers, 2028 (64.5%) were published in Journal Citation Report (JCR)-covered journals, and the remaining 1115 (35.5%), a significantly high share, in non-JCR covered journals. Given the high level of investment in the R & D in the IT sector in India over the years, a high rise in research publications in this area is natural expectation. But the increase registered was only marginal from 2299 papers during 1993-97 to 2391 publications during 1998-2001. 
The 3143 papers in computer science had appeared in 575 scholarly journals originating  from 24 countries. Of these, 2311 papers (73.5%) were in 524 foreign journals and the rest 832 papers (26.5%) in 51 Indian journals.  Amongst papers in foreign journals, the largest share (808 papers) had appeared in 155 UK journals, followed by 676 papers in 187 US journals, 463 papers in 89 Netherlands journals, 63 papers in 17 Singapore journals, 58 papers in 17 German journals, 38 papers in 11 Switzerland journals,  27 papers in 12 French journals, 24 papers in 9 Polish journals, etc.

4.  DISCUSSION 
There is a wide gap between the quantitative and qualitative performance of research in computer and control science research in India and this gap also persists even at the subfields level. This is more so because a significant proportion of country’s publications output is reported in non-SCI-covered journals. Its publications share in SCI-covered journals is low and confined to low and medium range impact factor journals. It is a matter of concern that its share in high impact factor journals is only marginal. The high productivity fields and the high impact fields are not the same. This disparity once again highlights the gap between the quantitative and qualitative performance of research in computer science. 
The reasons for the gap could be attributed to the need for protecting IPR interests or it may be due to lack of focus in research, lack of practical applications of research, or lack of accountability. It could also be that research efforts are directed at reinventing the wheel, the purpose being manpower development, increasing competence, and keeping the faculty up-to-date with current techniques.    
Although software industry in the country seems to be going stronger and also growing fast, it is surprising that R&D activity in computer software is neither high in the academic sector nor in the R&D sector. The low impact of this field (computer software) 
DESIDOC  Bulletin of Inf Technol , 2005, 25(1) 

========8========

vis-à-vis other computer science fields is a matter of concern. The leading areas of research across various sectors are not similar. In the academic sector the leading areas of research are systems & control theory and computer applications. In R&D sector, these are computer applications, and systems & control theory. In government sector, it is computer applications and in industrial sector it is computer software. Interestingly, R&D activity in computer hardware is also not a priority area of research of any sector. 
Currently, computer science research is driven mainly by academic sector. This is more so because three-fourth of country’s output in computer & control science is contributed by academic sector, and the remaining one fourth by institutions from many other sectors such as R&D sector, government sector, industrial sector.
