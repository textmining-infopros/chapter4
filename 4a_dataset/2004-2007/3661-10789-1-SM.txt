DBIT is a useful tool for library professionals, information managers, information scientists, and information specialists, computer personnels and researchers with a vision for development in IT. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The content analysis is definitely a case of information analysis. Therefore the term content analysis and information analysis are used as synonyms. Such process is applied to single coherent sources of information and largely it is only the 'elements of general framework' that guides work of rearranging systematically  selected portions for the purpose of condensation. The product of the process is quite distinct from coherent and unified body of information made out of loosely aggregated units.  
1.1

2. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
All the issues of the January 1997 to November 2002, with six each year were collected for the study. Both the methods of research in content analysis i.e., quantitative (or descriptive) and inferential have been use in evaluating the bulletin.  
3. ANALYSIS & INTERPRETATION 
Table 1 (included as appendix 1) shows distribution of general issues and thematic issues. Out of 33 issues, 16 are general issues and 13 are thematic issues. There is no thematic issue in 2001 & 2002 (vol. 21 & 22). The DBIT's concentration on thematic issues provides a great opportunity for young professionals to learn the advances in the latest IT  developments in library and information science; as the journal is peer reviewed.
