ABSTRACT
The mission-oriented R&D sector covers institutions both under R&D agencies/
departments and socio-economic ministries/departments of the Government of India.
The paper describes the role and contribution of mission-oriented R&D in the overall
research output of the country. The paper analyses various features of R&D sector
such as its publications growth and output, impact of research, strong and week subject
areas, collaboration profile, and major institutions and their quality.
Keywords: Mission-oriented, R&D sector, publications, science citation index

1. INTRODUCTION
The mission-oriented R&D sector in
India comprises two categories of research
institutions: those managed by autonomous
R&D agencies/departments, and those managed
by socio-economic ministries/departments
under the central/state governments. The
important R&D agencies/departments in the
country are: Council of Scientific & Industrial
Research (CSIR), Indian Council of Agricultural
Research (ICAR), Indian Council of Medical
Research (ICMR), Defence Research &
Development Organisation (DRDO), Department
of Science & Technology (DST), Department

of Atomic Energy (DAE), Department of Space
(DoS), Department of Biotechnology (DBT),
Department of Electronics (DoE), and Department
of Ocean Development (DOD).
The autonomous R&D agencies/
departments have a specific mandate to plan
and organise R&D activities in the country
and are required to play a significant role in
strengthening the knowledge economy of the
country. The primary aim of these agencies/
departments are to carry out basic and applied
research, besides making direct contribution
to the technological needs of the country in
35

the chosen areas like atomic energy, space
sciences, engineering, medicine, agriculture,
etc. These agencies have established a vast
network of research institutions across the
country for pursuing R&D. They also provide
extramural funding to institutions from other
S&T sectors, enabling them to undertake
research pursuits of interest and relevance
to the country. Some of the institutions under
these agencies/departments also undertake
postgraduate and PhD programmes and are
recognised as ‘deemed universities’ by the
University Grants Commision.
The research institutions under the socioeconomic ministries/departments of the central/
state governments undertake research in
selected subjects relevant to their parent
ministries/departments. The major socioeconomic ministries/departments are: Ministry
of Health & Family Welfare (MHFW), Ministry
of Mines (MoM), Ministry of Human Resource
Development (MHRD), Ministry of Information
& Communication Technology (MoIT), Ministry
of Environment, Forests & Wildlife (MoEN),
Ministry of Textiles (MoTX), Ministry of Water
Resources (MWR), Ministry of Non-Conventional
Energy Sources (MNES), Ministry of Power
(MoP), Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas
(MPNG), and Department of Culture (DoCU).
They have also established a small network
of research institutions across the country
for pursuing their R&D agenda and also provide
extra-mural funding to institutions from other
S&T sectors, but mainly to address their
own research needs.

2. MAIN OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of this paper are:(i)
to analyse the overall status of R&D institutions;
(ii) to identify the areas of their strength and
weakness; (iii) to analyse the quality of research,
as reflected in average impact factor and
citations per paper; (iv) to analyse the
collaborative profile; (vi) to make qualitative
and quantitative assessment of the major
participating institutions; and (vii) to compare
the strength of R&D sector vis-à-vis other
performing sectors in the country.

3. SOURCE DATABASE AND
METHODOLOGY
The publications data used in the report
is derived from Science Citation Index (SCI)–
Expanded Version available online in Web
of Science. Indian publications data of six
years (1985-86, 1993-94, 2001-02) was
downloaded from the above mentioned database.
The total number of publications downloaded
for the study were 85383. For measuring
institutional productivity, the study used integercounting method. Journal publications included
in the study were classified by subject content,
using the classification scheme of ThomsonISI for defining the main subject fields and
its sub-fields. Two types of indicators, namely
absolute and relative have been used for
bibliometric analysis of the publications data
covered in the study.

4. ANALYSES AND RESULTS
Based on the coverage of Indian publications
in the SCI, 23153 publications published in
1985-86, 27088 published in 1993-94, and
35142 published in 2001-02 were identified.
These publications were contributed by various
institutions belonging to different sectors
such as institutes of national importance,
universities and colleges, mission-oriented
R&D organisations, industries and others.
The mission-oriented R&D sector institutions
had contributed the second largest publications
to the country's output in S&T in 1985-86,
followed by INI, and industry sectors. However,
universities and colleges contributed the largest
share of publication to the country output in
S&T. This pattern of contribution persisted
during 1993-94 and 2001-02 also (Table 1).
The R&D agencies/departments contributed
more publications compared to socio-economic
ministries/departments. While the publications
share of R&D agencies/departments increased
gradually from 85.3 per cent in 1985-86 to
88.8 per cent in 2001-02, the publications
share of socio-economic ministries/departments
declined from 15.2 per cent in 1985-86 to
12.9 per cent in 2001-02 (Table 2).

Compared to other S&T sectors, the
mission-oriented R&D sector had shown the
fastest publication growth rate (102.9 per
cent) during 1985-86 to 2001-02. The R&D
agencies/departments had shown faster
publication growth (111.27 per cent) during
1985-86 to 2001-02, compared to the socioeconomic ministries/departments (73.05 per
cent). However, both had higher publications
growth rates than the average growth rate
of the country (51.78 per cent).

4.1 Profile of R&D Agencies/
Departments
Among the R&D agencies/departments,
CSIR made the largest contribution (32.9
per cent) in 1985-86, 37.5 per cent in 199394 and 36.2 per cent in 2001-02, respectively.
The DAE ranked 2 nd and maintained steady
publications share: 27.2 per cent in
1985-86, 26 per cent in 1993-94, and 26.7
per cent in 2001-02, respectively. The DST
ranked 4 th in 1985-86 and 3 rd in 2001-02 by
contributing 15.23 per cent publications share
to R&D sector agencies/departments.
ICAR ranked 3 rd in 1985-86 and 4 th in
2001-02 in publications output. Its publications

share, however, declined from 17.36 per cent
to 10.08 per cent during the corresponding
period. The DRDO ranked 6th and contributed
2.8 per cent publications share in 1985-86
and ranked 5 th and contributed 4.5 per cent
in 2001-02. The DoS ranked 5 th in 1985-86,
dropped to 6th rank in 2001-02, by contributing
4.74 per cent and 4.38 per cent publications
share during the corresponding period. The
ICMR had also shown decline in its publications
output from 4.39 per cent to 3.57 per cent
during the corresponding period. DBT though
ranked 8 th in the country, but its publications
share showed a significant rise from 0.11 per
cent in 1985-86 to 2.13 per cent in 2001-02
(Table 3).
Among the R&D agencies/departments,
the DBT has shown the fastest publications
growth rate during 1985-86 to 2001-02, followed
by DoE (500 per cent), DST (263 per cent),
DRDO (242 per cent), CSIR (132 per cent),
DAE (107 per cent), DoS (95.1 per cent),
ICMR (72 per cent), and ICAR (22.7 per
cent). Except for DAE, DoS, ICMR and ICAR,
all other R&D agencies/departments had shown
publications growth rate above the average
publication growth rate (111.2 per cent) of
the R&D agencies/departments (Table 3).

4.2 Profile of Socio-economic
Ministries/Departments

4.3 Impact of Research Output
of R&D Sector

Among the socio-economic ministries/
departments, the MHFW made the largest
contribution (38.38 per cent) in 1985-86,
40.53 per cent in 1993-94 and 46.73 per
cent in 2001-02, respectively. The MoM and
MHRD ranked 2 nd and 3 rd by contributing
7.24 per cent and 6.21 per cent publications,
respectively in 2001-02.

4.3.1 Is R&D Sector Publishing Enough
Research Output in High-Impact
Journals?

The MoIT, which was at the rock bottom
in rank in 1985-86, with only 0.3 per cent
publications share, ranked 4 th in 2001-02,
with 5.96 per cent share. The MoEN relatively
maintained stagnancy (5.81 per cent in 198586 and 5.85 per cent in 2001-02), despite
a slight dip in 1993-94 (4.93 per cent).
The MoTX had shown similar decline in
publications share (from 5.41 per cent in
1985-86 to 2.37 per cent in 2001-02). The
research institutions belonging to other socioeconomic ministries/departments had contributed
less number of publications (from 0.12 per
cent to 1.9 per cent) during the corresponding
periods (Table 4).
38

The mission-oriented R&D sector institutions
had been publishing bulk of their research
output in low impact factor (IF) journals (IF
between 0.001 and 1.999), though their
publications share in such journals had declined
(from 77.8 per cent in 1985-86 to 80.1 per
cent in 1993-94 and to 70 per cent in 200102). Their publications share in medium impact
journals (IF between 2 and 3.999) had been
relatively small, but rising (10.6 per cent in
1985-86, 12.3 per cent in 1993-94, and 19.3
per cent in 2001-02). Similarly, their share
in high-impact journals (IF between 4 and
above) had also been rising (1.25 per cent
in 1985-86, 2.5 per cent in 1993-94, and 7.3
per cent in 2001-02). Besides, their publications
share in zero-impact journals had been declining
(10 per cent in 1985-86, 5 per cent in 199394, and 3.2 per cent in 2001-02). The gradual
rise in publications share of mission-oriented
R&D institutions in medium and high impact
journals, coupled with their corresponding
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(1)

decline in low and zero impact journals indicated
a slight rise in the quality of their research
output (Table 5).

corresponding periods (Table 6). The R&D
agencies/departments registered higher average
IF in comparison to the socio-economic
ministries/departments. Their average IF was
above the average IF of the country and that
of socio-economic ministries/departments was
below the average IF of the country (Tables
7-9).

4.3.2 How Does Research Output of
R&D Sector Compares with Other
Sectors?
The mission-oriented R&D sector showed
the highest average IF per paper compared
to other sectors in 2001-02. Their average
impact factor per paper was 0.869 in 198586, 0.944 in 1993-94 and 1.454 in 2001-02
and was above the country's average impact
factor of 0.748, 0.805, and 1.229 during the

Of all the R&D agencies/departments,
the DBT had shown the highest average
impact factor per paper (1.398 in 1985-86,
1.986 in 1993-94, and 2.743 in 2001-02),
followed by DST (1.334 in 1985-86, 1.193 in
1993-94, and 1.928 in 2001-02) and ICMR

The MHFW ranked 1 st in publications output
in 1985-86, slipped to 2 nd position in 200102. The majority of the institutions of socioeconomic ministries/departments had shown
average impact per paper less than the average
IF per paper of the country. It implies that
they did not publish enough research papers
in medium and high quality journals
(Table 11).

4.3.3 How Frequently the Papers
Published by the R&D Sector
are Cited?
Nearly 93-94 per cent of R&D sector
publications received either low to medium
or zero citations. The share of highly cited
papers had been relatively small (6.23 per
cent in 1985-86 and 6.96 per cent in 199394). Nearly 28 per cent of its publications

output in 1985-86, and 24.7 per cent in
1993-94 received zero citations. Nearly 39
per cent of its papers in 1985-86 and 38 per
cent in 1993-94 were in the low citations
frequency range, and nearly 26 per cent of
its papers in 1985-86 and 29.9 per cent in
1993-94 in the medium citations frequency
range. Thus, the bulk of output did not have
high citation performance, as papers were
published mainly in low to medium impact
journals and not enough in high impact journals
(Tables 12 and 13).

However, for the socio-economic ministries/
departments, the citations trend was slightly
different. Their share of high impact papers
was still smaller, between 2.7 per cent and
3.7 per cent, compared to 6.8 per cent and
7.4 per cent, respectively for R&D agencies/
departments (Tables 14 and 15).

4.4 Subject Profile of R&D
Sector Institutions
Physics, chemistry, engineering, and
basic life sciences were the dominating areas
of research in the R&D sector. Its publications
share in these disciplines had been above
the R&D sector's average (10 per cent) in

The citations performance of the R&D
agencies/departments was also on the same
pattern as of the R&D sector as a whole.

each discipline and showed consistent rise
during 1985-86 to 2001-02. The publications
share increased in physics (from 18.7 per
cent to 23 per cent), chemistry (from 17.2
per cent to 22.6 per cent), engineering (from
18.3 per cent to 19.1 per cent), and for
basic life science (10.2 per cent to 12.2 per
cent) during 1985-86 to 2000-01 (Table 16).

compared to other S&T sectors, had been
below the country's average (0.78 in 198586, 0.90 in 1993-94, and 0.92 in 2001-02),
indicating that chemistry has still not emerged
as a strong area of research of R&D. Likewise,
R&D sector is also lagging in engineering,
where its activity index had declined from
1.07 in 1985-86 to 0.96 in 2001-02. Similar
decline in activity index (from 1.05 in 198586 to 0.72 in 2001-02) was noticed in clinical
medicine. It indicates that R&D is loosing
its grip in these subjects.

Compared to other S&T sectors, the
activity index of the R&D sector publications
in physics was 1.07 in 1985-86, but rose to
1.19 (19 per cent above the country average)
in 2001-02, indicating the emergence of physics
as a strong area in R&D. In basic life sciences,
although its activity index was above the
country's average (1.16), but it had remained
stagnant during 1985-86 to 2001-02
(Table 17). The activity index of chemistry,

Agricultural sciences, earth & environmental
sciences, biomedical sciences, biology,
mathematics and computer science have
been the low productivity areas of R&D sector.
Its publications share in these subjects had
been less than its average publication share

per discipline and had declined over the
years. The publications share of this sector
declined in agriculture (from 15.8 per cent
to 10.2 per cent), earth & environmental
sciences (from 9.8 per cent to 8.6 per cent),
biology (from 9.7 per cent to 4.8 per cent),
and mathematics (from 1.9 per cent to 1.5
per cent) during 1985-86 to 2001-02. In computer
science and biomedical sciences, its publications
share has remained stagnant (Table 17).
Despite the declining publications share
in agricultural sciences, the activity index
(1.26 in 1985-86 and 1.06 in 2001-02) of this
subject in R&D sector had been above the
country's average. It indicates that the R&D
sector has been gradually loosing its competitive
edge in this subject. The activity index of
the R&D sector in other subjects, such as
biology, biomedical sciences, computer science,
and mathematics had also been declined
and was below the country's average (Table17).
Earth & environmental sciences in spite of
its declining publications share, continued
to show activity index above the country's
average (1.55 in 1985-86 and 1.33 in 200102). This shows that the R&D sector has
maintained competitive edge in the subject
(Table 17).

In sum, it may be stated that the R&D
sector has competitive edge over other S&T
sectors in physics, basic life sciences, and
earth & environmental sciences. The growth
rate of publications in agricultural sciences
(30.8 per cent), earth & environmental sciences
(78.3 per cent), biology (0.47 per cent), and
mathematics (62.6 per cent) were far below
the average growth rate of the country (102.9
per cent) during 1985-86 to 2001-02. Computer
science, however, registered average growth
rate (100 per cent) near to country's average.
As agricultural sector is recognised as a
major source of economy for the country,
research in this area should be accorded
top priority. It is worrying that R&D sector
had witnessed consistent decline in its research
efforts in agricultural sciences.
4.4.1. Publications Output of R&D
Agencies/Departments
Physics, chemistry, and engineering
had also been the leading areas of research
of the R&D agencies/departments and their
publication trends had shown similar pattern
to total R&D sector institutions. The publications
output in clinical medicine, however, had
declined from 5.9 per cent in 1985-86 to 4.8
per cent in 2001-02 (Table 18).

R&D agencies/departments, the contribution
of CSIR had been the largest (1948 papers),
followed by DAE (1524 papers), ICAR (973
papers), DST (497 papers), DoS (266 papers),
and DRDO (157 papers) during 1985-86. The
CSIR and DAE also remained at the top two
positions during 1993-94 and 2001-02, followed
by DST, DoS and DRDO during 1993-94 and

Compared to other S&T sectors, the
activity index of the R&D agencies/departments
in 2001-02 had been above the country's
average in agricultural sciences, basic life
sciences, chemistry, computer science,
engineering, mathematics, and physics. This
picture was quite different from that of activity

2001-02 (Tables 20 to 22). The priority areas
of research, based on the number of papers
published, during 1985-86 of R&D agency/
departments were as follows: (i) CSIR–Chemistry,
engineering and basic life sciences, (ii) DAE–
Physics, engineering and chemistry, (iii) DST–
Physics, chemistry, and earth & environmental
sciences, (iv) DOS–Engineering and earth &
environmental sciences, (v) DRDO–Engineering
and physics, and (vi) ICMR–Clinical medicine
and biomedical sciences. The priority areas
of research also remained the same during

1993-94 and 2001-02, with the following
exceptions: DST gave higher priority to
engineering compared to earth & environmental
sciences, DoS to physics compared to
engineering, and DRDO to chemistry compared
to physics in 2001-02.
Thus, it is evident that the priority areas
of various R&D agencies/departments are
well defined and did not change much during
sixteen years period from 1985-86 to
2001-02.

Publications Output of Socioeconomic Ministries/Departments

Clinical medicine and biomedical sciences
had been the priority areas of research for
institutions belonging to the socio-economic
ministries/departments. In clinical medicine,
the publications share increased from 18.5
per cent in 1985-86 to 35.8 per cent in 200102 and in biomedical sciences from 12.2 per
cent to 15.9 per cent during the corresponding

period. Besides, earth & environmental sciences,
basic life sciences and engineering had also
been the priority areas of research of this
segment, but their publications share had
declined/remained stagnant. This segment
of R&D sector had shown significant decline
in the publications share in biology (from
13.6 per cent to 7.1 per cent) and agricultural
sciences (from 16.7 per cent to 7.0 per
cent) during 1985-86 to 2001-02
(Tables 23 to 24).

research output was 66:34 during 1985-86
and to 61:39 in both 1993-94 and 2001-02.
It implies that the R&D sector had paid
greater emphasis on international than national
collaborative research activity in 2001-02,
compared to 1985-86 (Tables 28 to 30).The
DRDO and DBT largely confined collaborative
research at national level. In collaborative
research at international level, DAE contributed
its largest publications share (43 per cent),
followed by ICMR (36 per cent), DOS (35 per
cent), DST (35 per cent), ICAR (30 per cent),
and CSIR (27 per cent), respectively in 198586. In 1993-94, the ICMR ranked at the top
(48.3 per cent), followed by DAE (47.6 per
cent), DoS (44 per cent), ICAR (40 per cent),
DST (38 per cent), DBT (36 per cent), and
CSIR (28 per cent). In 2001-02, the DAE
ranked at the top (48 per cent), followed by
DST (43 per cent), ICMR (37 per cent), DoS
(37 per cent), CSIR (31 per cent), DBT (30
per cent), ICAR (22 per cent), and DRDO
(20 per cent)(Table 30).

cent) during 1985-86 and 2001-02. R&D agencies/
departments witnessed the similar trend and
showed 11.27 per cent growth in collaborative
papers and 11.1 per cent in their total papers
during the corresponding period. The socioeconomic ministries had shown growth (54.4
per cent) in their collaborative research output.
Among R&D agencies/departments, in
collaborative research output the CSIR, DAE,
and DST constituted the largest share during
1985-86, 1993-94, and 2001-02. The publications
share of CSIR and DAE remained constant
around (31-32 per cent), whereas DST showed
a significant rise in its share from 10 per
cent in 1985-86 to 19 per cent in 2001-02.
The other scientific agencies/departments
had contributed only a smaller and marginal
publications share in the total collaborative
output. The collaborative research by R&D
sector, both at national and international
levels, had undergone a marginal shift. Its
ratio of national to international share in

5. FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Of all the S&T sectors in the country,
the R&D sector is the second largest in
terms of publications output in S&T. Two
main constituents of the R&D sector differ
in their research priorities. The R&D sector
comprises two main constituents: R&D agencies/
departments and their institutions and R&D
institutions of socio-economic ministries/
departments.
Physics, chemistry and engineering are
the priority areas of the R&D agencies/
departments. Clinical medicine and biomedical
sciences are the priority areas of institutions
of socio-economic ministries/departments.
R&D sector has performed better, compared
to other sectors of S&T, in physics, basic
life sciences, and earth & environmental sciences.
The R&D sector has gained competitive edge
in these particular areas over other S&T
sectors, in terms of overall publications activity.
However, in other areas, it loses out to other
S&T sectors. Biomedical sciences, chemistry,
clinical medicine, computer science, engineering,
and mathematics are the low priority areas
of the R&D sector, compared to other S&T
sectors. Although the sector's output in chemistry
and engineering had been quiet high, but
still it was below the country average in
terms of activity index.
R&D sector has shown the fastest
publications growth rate of 102.9 per cent
during 1985-86 to 2001-02, compared to other
S&T sectors. Its growth rate was twice the
average publications growth rate for the country's
output of all S&T sectors (51.7 per cent).
The INI sector ranked 2nd (79.8 per cent),
followed by Industry (72.26 per cent), and
universities and Colleges (35.6 per cent)
sectors. Of all the socio-economic ministries/
departments in the R&D sector, the MHFW
had made the largest contribution. It contributed
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Techol., 2007, 27(1)

38.3 per cent publications share in 1985-86,
31.6 per cent in 1993-94 and 46.7 per cent
in 2001-02. Of all the R&D agencies/departments
in the R&D sector, CSIR had been the largest
contributor, followed by DAE, DST, ICAR,
DRDO, DoS, ICMR, and DBT.
Nearly three-fourth of the R&D sector
publications output continues to be published
in low impact journals. The R&D sector published
nearly 77 per cent output in low impact
journals in 1985-86, 80 per cent in 1993-94
and 70 per cent in 2001-02, but its publications
share in such journals has shown consistent
decline. Average impact factor per paper of
R&D agencies/departments is more than the
publications of socio-economic ministries/
departments. The average factor per paper
of R&D agencies/departments was 0.901 in
1985-86, 0.971 in 1993-94, and 1.479 in
2001-02, whereas for socio-economic ministries,
it was 0.706, 0.768, and 1.357 respectively.
The DoCU, MHFW, and MICT showed average
impact factor per paper above the country's
average in 2001-02. R&D agencies/departments
showed better citations performance, compared
to the socio-economic ministries/departments.
The share of research output by R&D agencies/
departments that received 20 or more citations
per paper was 6.8-7.4 per cent, higher compared
to 2.7-3.7 per cent of socio-economic ministries/
departments.
In terms of citation impact, DST institutions
ranked at the top among the R&D agencies/
departments. In 2001-02, it received highest
citations per paper (3.698), followed by
DBT (3.464), DAE (3.438), ICMR (3.038),
CSIR (2.767), DoS (2.511), DRDO (1.424),
ICAR (0.966), and DoE (0.333). The citations
window used for computing citations performance
of various R&D agencies/departments was
2 to 3 years. In terms of citations impact,
DoCU supported institutions ranked at the
top among the various socio-economic ministries,
as their research output received the highest
citations per paper (23.5) in 2001-02, followed
by DCP (3.31), DoC (3.17), MPNG (3.11),
MoIT (3.09), MHFW (2.16), MoP (1.35), MoM
(1.32), MoEN (1.29), DoCO (1.29), MoE (1.27),
MWR (0.83), MoTX (0.44), MoT (0.43), and
DCA (0.29). The citations window used for
53

computing citations performance of various
socio-economic ministries was 2 to 3 years.
Collaborative research profile of the socioeconomic ministries is better, compared to
R&D agencies/departments. The R&D agencies/
departments contributed 7.96 per cent share
of collaborative papers in the total output in
1985-86, 15.45 per cent in 1993-94, and
46.2 per cent in 2001-02. On the other hand,
socio-economic ministries contributed 15.9
per cent, 26.3 per cent, and 59.2 per cent
during the corresponding periods. CSIR, DAE,
and DST continue to dominate their counterparts
in terms of their publications output from
collaborative research. Their share had been
largest compared to other agencies during
1985-86, 1993-94, and 2001-02. But the
collaborative publications share of CSIR and
DAE remained constant (around 31-32 per
cent) during the three periods of study. DST,
however, showed a significant rise in its
collaborative share from 10 per cent in 198586 to 19 per cent in 2001-02. Other agencies
contributed only smaller share in the total
collaborative output.
Collaborative research output is growing
faster than the rate at which the total output
is growing. The R&D sector as a whole had
shown faster growth in collaborative research
output (10.17 per cent), compared to total
output by the sector (10.3 per cent) during
sixteen years between 1985-86 and 200102. Both the segments of the R&D sector
had shown the similar trends. However, the
growth in collaborative research output of
R&D agencies/departments (11.26 per cent)
was higher than that of socio-economic ministries
(54.4 per cent).
Collaborative research at the international
level is growing faster than at national level
in the R&D sector. In 1985-86, contribution
of R&D sector at national and international

54

levels was in the ratio of 66:34, which changed
to 61.39 in 2001-02. It implies that collaborative
research at international level received greater
attention in 2001-02.
R&D agencies/departments seem to
be pursuing the same agenda, since 198586. This is evident from the fact that the
priority areas for research of various agencies/
departments did not change significantly during
16 years period from 1985-86 to 2001-02.
The R&D sector has 26 high-productivity
institutions, which published 100 or more
papers during 1985-86, 1993-94, or 200102. Of these, the top 10 institutes ranked
on composite quality index are Jawaharlal
Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research
(JNCASR), Bangalore; Institute of Physics
(IOP), Bhubaneswar; Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai; Physical
Research Laboratory (PRL, Ahmedabad; Indian
Institute of Astronomy (IIA), Bangalore); Saha
Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP), Kolkata;
Centre for Chemical and Molecular Biology
(CCMB), Hyderabad; SN Bose National Centre
for Basic Sciences (SNBNCBS), Kolkata;
Indian Association for the Cultivation of Sciences
(IACS), Kolkata; and National Physical Laboratory
(NPL), New Delhi.
Given the special role played by agricultural
sector in strengthening the GDP of the country
and seeing the consistent decline in agricultural
sciences publications, it is desirable that
agricultural research be accorded higher priority
in research. Collaborative research in the
R&D sector, especially at international level,
must be encouraged for accelerating the
pace of growth in S&T and for ensuring quality
and quantity output. The R&D sector may
place special focus on its weaker areas of
research, such as biomedical science, chemistry,
clinical medicine, computer science, engineering,
and mathematics to improve the performance
of the country in these areas.
