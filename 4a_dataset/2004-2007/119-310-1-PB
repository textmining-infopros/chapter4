ABSTRACT
The paper analyses the cumulative output in science and technology during 1993
to 2003 of different regions/countries in the world. It also analyses the contributions
made by the developed and the developing countries in the different broad subject fields
to identify their strengths in the different fields of research.

Keywords: Science & technology, third world countries, developed countries, S&T publications

1. lNTRODUCTlON
Science and Technology (S&T) efforts
are far from evenly distributed around the
world. The gross expenditure on research
and development (GERD), GERD as a
percentage of gross national product (GNP),
and the broad indicators of the input into
S&T manifest this picture. In terms of the
expenditure on research and develo~ment
(R&D), the less developed c ~ u n t r i e s ' s ~ e n t
about 19 per cent of the total world expenditure
compared to their 30 per cent share of the
world's GDp (based on data from 1997 to
2000). On an average, 1.85 per cent of their
national GDP was spent on R&D. The lesser

t

developed countries devoted less than I per
cent (0.9 per cent) of their GDP to R&D.
Although the less developed countries account
for 79 per cent of the world's population,
they represent only 27 per cent of the total
number of researchers in the world. There
are 10 times more researchers (per million
inhabitants) in the developed countries than
in the less developed countries.
Three out of every 1000 inhabitants in
developed countries are researchers, while
only three out of every 10,000 inhabitants
are researchers in the less developed countries
(UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2003).

The Paper is a part af the study on Measures of the Progress of Science in India: An Analysis Of the
Publication Output in Science and Technology, sponsored by the Office of the Scientific Adviser to the
Government of India.

Input data such as GERD, GERD per
capita, GERD as a percentage of GDP, and
researchers per million inhabitants are not
adequate by themselves to make a pertinent
evaluation of the efficiency and performance
of a national S&T system. The output from
the national S&T systems, considered equally
important parameter of R&D evaluation, has
been measured and evaluated in this paper
using publication indicators'.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Very few earlier studies attempted to
make global comparison of world science,
as reflected in the publications output. Eugene
Garfield2 carried out analysis of world output,
with particular reference to third world
publications of 1973, using Science Citation
Index (SCI) database and their citations received
(from 1973 to 1978). In this study, US was
found to have shown the maximum share
(43 per cent) of publications (and more than
50 per cent citations share), followed by the
UK, the then USSR, FRG, France, Japan,
and Canada. lndia (with 7888 papers and
15515 citations) and Argentina (with 41 10
papers and 4110 citations) were the only
two developing countries ranked 8th and
25th among top 25 countries. Out of the
353000 articles indexed in the 1973 SCI file,
only 16000 articles were authored from 93
third world countries. lndia accounted for
half the articles from the developing countries.
However, India's contribution was comparatively
poor, when citation impact of its research
output was considered.
Acomparative study, titled 'The Scientific
Wealth of Nations' by May3, based on SCI
database covered 8.4 million papers and 72
million citations appeared in 4000 journals
since 1981 to 1994 from 79 countries. It
showed that from 1981 to 1994, the world's
output of papers increased by 3.7 per cent
per year; 15 countries (including G-7 countries)
accounted for 81.3 per cent of the total
papers. The US and the European Union
(EU) published 35 per cent and 32 per cent
papers of world share, respectively. lndia
with 2.4 per cent and China with 0.9 per
cent share of papers and 0.7 and 0.3 per

cent share of citations were at the 8th and
13thp~~ition,
respectively. In terms of percentage
share of citations of these countries, the
ranking was similar, except for lndia and
China. In terms of relative citation impact
(RCI, citations per paper divided by country's
average), the US ranked first. The five major
countries in terms of publication share invested
more in R&D than the other countries. The
smaller countries with high ranking in RCI,
notably Switzerland and Sweden (2" and
3rdrank by RCI) were relatively high investors
in R&D. lndia and China had low R&D investment
and also had a low RCI (0.27 each) and
were ranked 66th and 65th, respectively. In
terms of RCI data across 20 broad subject
fields, USA ranked first by citation share in
all the subject fields, while UK was second
in 15 of the 20 subject fields. The rankings
were more varied, when a better quality measure,
revealed comparative advantage (RCA), was
used. On the basis of this index, UK had
comparative advantage in pharmacology, clinical
medicine, plant and animal science, and
neuroscience. The asian countries showed
prominence in research related to certain
industries, such as engineering, computing,
chemistry, and materials. Some countries
like Australia, Canada, New Zealand and
South Africa showed prominence in research
based on natural resources.
Another study, titled, 'The Scientific Impact
of Nations', by David ~ i n used
g ~ publications
and citations data reported in SCI. In this
study, a more selective parameter was used;
the top one per cent highly cited publications
under seven categories including: clinical
medicine, pre-clinical medicine and health,
biologicalsciences, environment, mathematics,
and physical sciences were studied. David
King used data from 1993-97 and 1997-2001
for viewing the growth of scientific output.
Thirty-one countries (including G8 and 15
countries from the European Union) together
accounted for the 98 per cent of the world's
highly cited papers, while remaining 162
countries contributed less than 2 per cent
only. Among the US and the EU, the former
had a higher disciplinary footprint than latter.
The footprints from the EU were more symmetrical
and slightly more than the US in physical
.

sciences and engineering, but less in life
and medical sciences. Russia and Japan
were relatively stronger in physical sciences
and engineering, and France in mathematics.
Germany had highest impact in the physical
sciences in contrast to the UK, which had
a strong impact in medical, life, and environmental
sciences. The 2004 rank order places lndia
at 22nd, China at lgth, South Korea at 20th
and Russia at 16th, Brazil at 23rd, South
Africa at 2gth,and Iran at 31St place. According
to David King, citation rankings could hide
important developments, particularly in countries
like China and India, which have developed
their science base rapidly and effectively
over the past few years.

On comparing scientific output and R&D
expenditure, North America showed a relative
decline from 1990 to 2000 in both respects.
Asia showed sharp increase in R&D expenditure
and publications. Oceania and Latin America
increased their share of publications, while
maintaining an unchanged R&D expenditure.
Europe also increased its share in publications,
but lost ground in expenditure. Africa showed
an alarming drop in both publications and
expenditure. Also, the share of physics, chemistry
and engineering papers was significantly higher
in the new industrialised countries in Asia,
while clinical medicine and biomedical research
made a larger part of the publications of the
developed countries.

Another review5analysed the impact factor
(IF) per paper of the publications of major
countries covered in SCI from 1999 to 2003.
In this survey, US was placed at the top,
followed by the UK, Canada, Germany, France,
Italy, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan,
China, and India. Their ranking order did not
change much, but their impact per paper
had improved with time. For example, the
average IF during 1999 to 2003 per paper
improved in case of lndia (from 1.38 to 1.86),
China (from 1.56 to 2.17), South Korea
(from 2.0 to 2.62), Taiwan (from 1.85 to
2.42) and Singapore (from 1.92 to 2.56),
respectively. Compared to developing countries,
the average IF during 1999 to 2003 per paper
had improved in the US (from 5.61 to 6.22),
the UK (from 4.64 to 5.46), Germany (from
4.26 to 5.13), and France (from 4.08 to
4.75), respectively.

A recent study on Academic Ranking of
the World universities-2003~ranked the top
500 universities among the 2000 world
universities, based on more stringent criteria
and the range of disciplines covered. The
study used the following parameters to rank
universities: (i) number of noble laureates
on the faculty of physics, medicine, and
economics from 1911 to 2002, (ii) highly
cited researchers in 21 broad subject categories
from 1981 to 1999, (iii) articles published
in Nature and Science during 2000-2002,
(iv) articles in the SCI Expanded and the
Social Science Citation Index, and (v) the
academic performance of each faculty member,
where the indices (i) to (iv) were weighted
by the number of the faculty members.

Another study published in UNESCO
UIS Bulletin ( 2 0 0 5 ) ~presents a bibliometric
analyses of 20 (1981 -2000) years of world
scientific production as reflected by the
publications indexed in the SCI, with particular
emphasis on developing countries.
According to this study, developing countries
saw a steady increase in their share of
scientific production from 7.5 per cent of
world's papers in 1981 to 17.1 per cent in
2000, against the steady decrease of publications
of developed countries from 93.6 per cent to
87.9 per cent during the corresponding period.
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Techol., 2007, 27(1)

Based on equal weighting to the above
five criterion, the top 100 universities in the
world comprised 58 universities from the
US, 29 from Europe, four from Canada, five
from Japan, two from Australia and one from
Israel. In Asia-Pacific among the top 90
universities, 35 were from Japan, 13 from
China, 13 from Australia, eight from South
Korea, six from Israel, five from Taiwan and
three from India.

3. OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of the paper are to
analyse: (i) the publications share of different
regions/countries in world output, (ii) the
comparative share of developed and developing

countries in different subjects, and (iii) the
comparative strength of developing countries
in publications output and citation impact
by subject.

4. SOURCE AND METHOD-

OLOGY
For comparative study of Indian research
output with other countries, the 11 years
combined publications and citation data of
146 countries during 1993 to 2003 were
analysed. The publications data for the purpose
were derived from the Web of Science database
(downloaded in February 2004) and from ISIThomson Press Report on Essential Science
Indicators.

5. ANALYSES AND RESULTS

5.1 Publications Share of

Different Regions/Countries
in World Output
For a decade, North America had been
the largest contributor to the scientific
publications output in the world. But more
recently, Europe has overtaken it. It contributed
the largest publications share (43.6 per cent
world papers and 40.8 per cent world citations)
of which 36.8 per cent world papers and
37.9 per cent world citations were from Western
Europe and 7.3 per cent papers and 2.88
per cent citations from Eastern Europe.
Compared to Europe, the America contributed
35.4 per cent world papers and 45.8 per
cent world citations, of which 33.6 per cent
papers and 44.7 per cent citations were
from North America and only 1.84 per cent

papers and 0.97 per cent citations were
from CentralISouth America (Figs 1 and 2).
The Asian share of publications in the
world output was 16.9 per cent (10.4 per
cent world citations) of which the largest
share (10.5 per cent papers and 7.55 per
cent citations) was from far East Asia, followed
by South Asia (2.06 per cent papers and
0.71 per cent citations), Middle East (1.48
per cent papers and 1.15 citations), and
South East Asia (2.96 per cent papers and
0.99 per cent citations). The Oceania region
contributed only 2.77 per cent share in world
publications and 2.52 per cent citations share.
In contrast, the smallest share (1.2 per cent
papers and 0.58 per cent citations) to world
output was from Africa (Figs 1 and 2).
India is one of the top 19 countries
contributing one per cent share or more to
the world output. These top 19 countries in
the world account for 86.2 per cent world
papers and 91.4 per cent world citations. Of
these, the US contributed largest publications
(29.18 per cent) and accounted for 40.13
per cent world citations. The UK, Japan
Germany and France each contributed 5 per
cent to 9 per cent of the world papers,
whereas Canada, Italy and Russia contributed
3 per cent to 4 per cent each.
China, Australia, Spain and the Netherlands
each contributed 2 per cent to 3 per cent
of the world papers, while India, Sweden,
Switzerland, South Korea, Belgium, Israel,
and Poland each contributed one per cent
to 2 per cent to the world papers. The next

to 0.99 per cent share each to the world
output. Their combined publicationsand citations
share was 10.15 per cent and 6.8 per cent,
respectively. Of these, 11 countries (Denmark,
Finland, Austria, Turkey, Norway, Greece,
Czech Republic, Hungary, Ukraine, Portugal,
and Ireland) were from Europe, two (South
Africa and Egypt) from Africa, two (Brazil
and Argentina) from SouthAmerica, two (Taiwan
and Singapore) from Asia and one each from
North America (Mexico) and Oceania (New
Zealand) (Table 1).

classified into 19 broad subjects. Their
publications share in world output and in
world citations were analysed by these broad
subject. Among the developing countries,
materials science ranked top (21 -60 per cent
share) followed by agriculture (19.56 per
cent), chemistry (17.75 per cent), engineering
(17.39 per cent), physics (15.91 per cent),
plant and animal sciences (15.76 per cent),
mathematics (14.49 per cent), computer science
(13.34 per cent), and pharmacology and
toxicology (12.76 per cent) (Table 3).

5.2. Developed versus

The developing countries have acquired
significant ranks among the top 20 in world
output in select subjects. For example, India
ranked first among developing countries in
publications output in four subjects: agriculture
(4th rank in the world list, 5.63 per cent
share to the world output), plant and animal
sciences (8th rank, 3.13 per cent share to
the world output), energy and environment
rank, 1.97 per cent share to the world
(1lth
output) and biology and biochemistry (14th
rank, 1.51 per cent share to the world output).
It ranked 2" in materials science (8thrank,
3.56 per cent share to the world output),
chemistry (8th rank, 3.62 per cent share to
the world output), physics (gthrank, 2.26 per
cent share to the world output), geosciences
( l l t hrank, 2.31 per cent share to the world
output), pharmacology and toxicology (13th
rank, 1.89 per cent share to the world output),
space sciences (13th rank, 1.55 per cent
share to the world output), mathematics (8th
rank, 3.56 per cent share to the world output),
molecular biology and genetics (lgth rank
and 0.76 per cent share to the world output),
and immunology (20th rank, 0.7 per cent
share to the world output). It ranked 3rd in
engineering ( l l t hrank, 2.39 per cent share
to the world output) and microbiology (17th
rank, 1.42 per cent share to the world output).

Developing Countries
Out of 146 countries covered in Essential
Science Indicators database, 48 are developed
and 98 developing. The combined publications
output of developed countries during 1993 to
2003 was 87.27 per cent accounting for 94.74
per cent world citations, whereas developing
countries contributed only 12.73 per cent
publications accounting for 5.36 per cent
world citations.
Among the developed countries, the top
seven accounted for 64.38 per cent world
papers and 75.17 per cent world citations,
the next seven countries accounted for 13.9
per cent world papers and 12.72 per cent
world citations, and the next seven accounted
for 5.45 per cent world papers and 4.8 per
cent world citations. The combined output
of these 21 developed countries was 83.8
per cent world papers and 92.74 per cent
world citations (Table 1).Among the developing
countries, the top seven countries accounted
for 8.84 per cent world papers and 3.39 per
cent world citations, the next seven countries
accounted for 2.01 per cent papers and 1.07
per cent citations, and the next seven accounted
for 0.8 per cent world papers and 0.33 per
cent world citations. The combined output
of these 21 countries was 11.65 per cent
world papers and 4.78 per cent world citations
(Table 2).

Developing countries that faired better
in terms of relative citation impact in different
subjects are shown in Appendix I.In fact,
the developing countries (particularly India
and China) that showed higher productivity
have not done well in terms of relative citation

impact. On the other hand, the Latin American
countries, though contributed medium level
research output, have done better in terms
of relative citation impact compared to Asian
and African countries. Among Asian countries,
South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore made
greater relative citation impact in differrent
subject fields than china, India, Thailand
and Malaysia. Among Africa, only South
Africa made high impact in few subject fields
(Appendix 11).

6. CONCLUSIONS
The developing countries contributed 12.73
per cent share to the global research output

and attracted 5.36 per cent share in world
citations as seen from the world output during
1993-2003. But in some select subjects their
contributions are larger: materials science
(21.60 per cent), agriculture (19.56 per cent),
chemistry (17.75 per cent), engineering (17.39
per cent), physics (15.91 per cent), plant
and animal sciences (15.76 per cent),
mathematics (14.49 per cent), and computer
science (13.34 per cent). Similarly, in select
subjects they attracted higher citations share:
materials science (13.13 per cent), engineering
(11. I 5 per cent), agriculture (9.63 per cent),
chemistry (9.55 per cent),

science (7.58 per cent), space sciences
(5.94 per cent), geosciences (5.72 per cent)
and pharmacology and toxicology (5.46 per
cent). Among the developing countries, China,
India, Brazil, South Korea, etc., have gained
top ranks, but in select subjects only. For
example, China ranked 1" among developing
countries in terms of its publications output
in material science (4th rank in the world
list), mathematics (5Ih rank), chemistry (7Ih
rank), physics (7th rank), engineering (7th
rank), computer science (8" rank), pharmacology
and toxicology (1Oth rank), space sciences
(12Ih rank), geosciences (1Oth rank), biology
& biochemistry (15Ih rank), and psychiatry1
psychology (20th rank). Brazil acquired lsl
rank among developing countries in neuroscience
and behavior (13th rank in the world list),
molecular biology and genetics (16Ih rank in
the world list) and immunology (17thrank in
the world list). South Korea acquired first
rank among developing countries in publications
output in only microbiology (12thrank in the
world list).
Among developing countries, lndia ranked
at the top in terms of research output in:
agriculture (4th rank in world list, 5.63 per
cent contribution), plant and animal sciences
(8thrank, 3.13 per cent), energy and environment
(11th rank, 1.97 per cent) and biology and
biochemistry (14th rank, 1.51 per cent). It
ranked 2" following China in materials science,
chemistry, physics, geosciences, pharmacology
and toxicology, space sciences, mathematics,
molecular biology and immunology. In terms
of relative citations impact, both lndia and
China lag behind other developing countries,
particularly Latin American countries, South
Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and South
Africa.Developing countries require concentrated
efforts for improving the quality and quantity

of research output. These countries need to
build up more effectively their scientific capacity,
competence, and knowledge base to bridge
scientific and technological gap with developed
countries. Achieving this will depend in part
by increasing investment in R&D and higher
education sector (strengthening educational
and R&D infrastructure),and in part by increasing
deployment of qualified and competent S&T
manpower, greater interaction among the
various S&T sectors, and increased scientific
cooperation among developed countries.
