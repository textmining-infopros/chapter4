ABSTRACT
Library and information professionals today need to acquire knowledge and skills
in information and communication technology (ICT) as the services of more and more
libraries are now centering around information technology, especially in educational
institutions. Application of ICT in academic environment in India has increased gradually
in the recent decades, more particularly in Tamil Nadu. This paper examines the ICT skills
among librarians in engineering educational institutions in Tamil Nadu. The analysis of
the data represents the extent and the level of ICT skills possessed by the librarians
of these institutions.

INTRODUCTION

Developments in the ICT have made
profound changes in each and every field.
These developments are also known as
computer/information/communication/Internet/
multimedia revolution, binary age, information
age, information society, information
superhighway, and digital age. The changes
are evident all over the world, and its effects
being felt in every walk of life and in every
field of knowledge. The field of library and
Received on 26 March 2007

information science (LIS) is also not an exception
to this phenomenon.
In the changing environment, every library
grows in terms of reading material, equipment,
space, staff, readers, etc. The library and
information scenario is changing at a dynamic
pace; there is a paradigm shift from print
media to web media; from ownership of documents
to access to information; intermediary to
end-user model of services; and from location
of specific libraries to digital/virtual/hybrid
55

libraries. Similarly, there is a change in the
needs and interests of the readers. Hence,
the role of library and information professionals
has also changed dramatically. To meet the
current requirements, library professionals
must be able to perform various tasks coping
up with the changes in technological environment.
This paper aims to present the ICT skills
possessed by the librarians working in the
universities, deemed universities, government
colleges, government-aided colleges, and selffinancing engineering colleges of Tamil Nadu.

1.1 Engineering Education in Tamil
Nadu: An Overview
Tamil Nadu is one of the constituent
state of Indian Republic. The first and foremost
engineering college in Tamil Nadu, College
of Engineering (now named as Anna University),
Guindy, Chennai (formerly Madras), was
established in 1886. This was followed by
a number of colleges established by the
state government, government-aided, and selffinancing managements. At present, there
are about 255 engineering educational institutions
in Tamil Nadu out of which 222 colleges are
in self-financing category. There are six
engineering educational institutions exclusively
for women also.
These institutions can be classified as
the universities (3), deemed universities (14),
government (13), aided (3), and self-financing
engineering colleges (222). Some of the leading
and self-financing engineering colleges
established in the early eighties have been
elevated to the status of deemed universities.
They are Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore;
Sathyabhama Institute of Science and
Technology, Chennai; Shanmugha Arts, Science,
Technology and Research Academy (SASTRA),
Tanjore; Amritha Institute of Technology and
Science, Coimbatore; Avinashilingam Institute

RELATED RESEARCH

Review of the literature shows a few
studies on skills of the library professionals
published in India and other countries. Marion1
analysed the online employment advertisements
to determine current professional requirements
for technologically oriented jobs. Prathiba
Naran2 has outlined the skills of the librarians,
which make them suitable for a variety of
positions in the diverse fields such as software,
database and information area, publishing
trade, and outsourcing opportunities. Kumaresan3
projected the emerging scenario of LIS
professionals in the Indian environment and
emphasised the future challenges of the
librarians with added knowledge of network
and information retrieval systems. Jones 4
stressed the importance of IT literacy for the
professionals working in library and information
centres. Nick Joint 5 stated that the skills
required in the digital libraries are more
heterogeneous, fluid, and fast changing. He
emphasised the needs of different training
philosophy with constructive approach to teaching
and learning which digital library training might
also include.
Shiholo and Ocholla6 outlined the changing
trends of training needs of informational
professionals in Kenya and argued that core
knowledge and skills for information providers
have to be reviewed regularly. Nyamboga,
et al. 7 surveyed the skills of professionals
working in the university libraries in Kenya.
Nyamboga 8 also examined the training
opportunities for library and information
professionals in India and stressed the need
for developing information skills and information
literacy programmes. Rajalakshmi 9 outlined
the skills required by the LIS professionals
in the 21st century in the context of ICT
implications.Bawden, et al. 10 examined the
approach to the education and training of
librarians in digital libraries and the competencies
required for creating and managing digital
libraries, and assessed these competencies
vis-à-vis LIS education in the UK and Slovenia.
Kannappanavar and Kumbargoudar11 analysed
the management skills in the light of ICT
among LIS professionals in agricultural
universities in India. There are few surveys
DESIDOC Bull. Inf. Technol., 2007, 27(6)

conducted in libraries in India in the recent
decade, but not a single study of ICT skills
of librarians in Tamil Nadu has been reported.

ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

7.1 Sample Size
Two hundred twenty-five questionnaires
were distributed among different categories
of engineering institutions in Tamil Nadu.
The responses have been classified in the
Table 1. Out of 225 questionnaires, 171 were
responded. A majority of them (161) were
from the self-financing institutions.

7.2 Background Information about the
Libraries Surveyed
Out of 171 libraries surveyed, 42.1 per
cent were established during 1996 and 2000.
Nearly one-fourth of these were established
at the beginning of the new millennium. By
and large, about one-third of the samples
were established before 1995.
Only 77 engineering educational institutions
have been certified by the agencies like the
International Organisation for Standardisation
(ISO), or the National Board of Accreditation
(NBA) of the All India Council of Technical
Education (AICTE), or both. In India independent
accrediting agencies (NAAC, NBA) evaluate

higher educational institutions on the basis
of their strengths in curricular aspects, teaching
methodology, research facilities, infrastructure,
and student-support mechanism. While NAAC
grades arts and science colleges and universities,
NBA offers accreditation to the institutions
offering courses in engineering, management,
architecture, pharmacy, hotel management,
and country planning. Table 2 shows that
engineering educational institutions in Tamil
Nadu are keen in getting accredited either
by a national agency or by an international

organisation to exhibit quality and competition.
The libraries of these institutions have varied
collection such as printed books and journals,
and also e-collections such as e-books, CD
ROM products, e-journals, and e-project reports.

7.3 Background Information about the
Librarians
One hundred and forty-two professionals,
out of 171 respondents have postgraduate
qualifications. One hundred ten persons are
holding MPhil as professional qualification
(six out of them have PhD degree also).
Their professional experiences range from 5
to 15 years (Table 3). One hundred and thirtynine respondents were in the age group of
less than 40 years. However, seven out of
171 librarians were above 50 years
(Table 4).

7.4 IT Skills of the Librarians
The survey was aimed to know the level
of ICT skills possessed by the respondents.
Data in the Tables 5 to 11 shows the knowledge
of librarians about operating systems, software

Table 4. Classification of the respondents
according to age and sex

packages and programming languages, library
automation software, web awareness and
online facilities/services, besides the technical
skills and managerial skills. The figures indicated
in the tables show the total number of library
and informational professional with ICT skills,
who have been rated based on a five-point
scale as fully known (5), known (4), uncertain
(3), not known (2), and not at all known (1)
(Table 5).
Table 5 shows that a majority of the
library professionals were conversant with
DOS and Windows since their weighted arithmetic
mean (WAM) values are 45.87 and 42.66,
respectively. Only few professionals possess
skills in the UNIX and LINUX. It reveals that
LIS professionals were familiar with popular
operating systems such as DOS and Windows,
a mandatory requirement for using PCs.
Table 6 shows that the LIS professionals

possess skills in as many as eight software
packages and programming language, but
the degree of skill varies. The professionals
evinced interest and proficiency in MS-Office
package such as MS-Word (48.7 per cent),
MS-Excel (48.06 per cent), MS-Access (44.20
per cent), MS PowerPoint (43.33 per cent)
with first four ranks, respectively.
Table 7 shows that the respondents have
fair knowledge of library automation softwares.
For online facilities most of library professionals
were preferring OPAC/Web OPAC. About
39.2 per cent of them indicated that they
were aware about these facilities, which is
very essentials in today’s environment. It
was followed by CD ROM search; e-mail;
Internet surfing and search engines.
Table 9 indicates the technical skills of
the library professionals. It shows that creating
a catalogue and metadata are the prime
choices of the respondents. It is followed by
OCR, user interface design and image
technology. More than 55 per cent of the
respondents were having fair knowledge of
all managerial skills (Table 10).

7.5 Means and Methods of Acquiring IT
Skills
Table 11 shows that formal education,
informal education (distance education),
education through colleagues, self-study, training
at work place, training by suppliers, attending
IT programmes, and workshops were the
main sources of acquiring ICT skills by the
library professionals under the study. Selfstudy (74.9 per cent) is a popular mode
among librarians as medium of learning and
updating their knowledge and skills of ICT
in the engineering educational institutional
libraries. It is followed by methods such as

7.6 Constraints to Acquiring IT Skills
Table 12 depicts that work overload of
the librarians (84.8 per cent) is the major
constraint in acquiring ICT skills. This is
followed by negative attitude of the higher
authorities (69 per cent) and limited opportunities
(56.7 per cent) in the second and third rank,
respectively.

CONCLUSION

The study shows that the library and
information professionals working in engineering
educational institutions in Tamil Nadu in
one way or the other are acquiring considerable
basic skills in ICT. But they need to concentrate
more on network-based services and digital
library services. In order to enhance the ICT
skills among library professionals few
suggestions have been made here:
