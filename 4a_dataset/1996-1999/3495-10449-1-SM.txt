Role of lnformation Technologies in Electronic lnformation
Transfer and in Providing Value-added lnformation Services
V Sreenivasulu

Abstract
lnforrnation technology plays an important role in electronic. message
transfer, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic files transfer protocols,
transfer of voice, text and images through ISDN, remote electronic
information access and retrieval, and the enforcement of research,
education and distance learning through 'virtual global university'. In future,
these information technologies can engage in interactive TV, picture phones
and TV/PCs purchase. Findings of a survey, conducted to determine the
potential. use, non-use and non-availability of IT service in different
libraries/documentation centres are also given.

INTRODUCTION

information and active advice repositoryaccessible from anywhere with
improved indexing, extortion, retrieval, and data
mining techniques. It will be a library without
walls such as internet-based world wide web.

The spectrum of information technology (IT),
includes devices and strategies running from
computers to communications, from video
games to virtual reality, from desktop publishing
to digital photography and from highend to
high definition TV. lr~formationtechnology may
be called as the mother of technologies. IT has
created or made possible the availability of
awesome quantities of information. IT provides
a number of value added information services
and facilitates electronic information transfer.

2.1

The most common example of this
technology is electronic mail. The objective of
electronic messaging technology is to allow the
efficient transfer of messages of all kinds
between the users of networks. Voice mail is
also a form of electronic messaging. lnternet
mail supports transfer of text files only and
multimedia internet mail system (MIMS) use still
animated video images, graphics and text to
pass messages. lnternet mail and MIMS are yet
to be adapted widely.

ELECTRONIC INFORMATlON
TRANSFER

Information
and
communication
technologies, etectronic devices and systems
enable computers and people to be connected
in order to share information resources. These
technologies facilitate transfer of electronic data
or information from one place to another, one
person to another and from traditional library to
the
universal library-a
vast distributed

2.2

Electronic Data Interchange

Electronic data interchange (EDI) is the
direct computer-tocomputer exchange of
electronic information. While this is a general
definition, ED1 is really focused on transfer of

electronic information normally provided in
digital documents. The benefits of using ED1
over traditional mechanisms include cost saving,
speed, error reduction and security.

2.3

Electronic File Transfer through
Protocols

If the user wishes to acquire a specific or
complete information from a digital source then
file transfer operation is usually preferred.
Electronic file transfer allows pieces of
information to be transferred that may not exist
in print or other traditional media. File transfer
mechanism enables efficient transfer of both
text and non-text characters. Thus, informafion
transfer can take place completely and
efficiently. Commonly used protocols are FTP,
TCP/IP for Internet, and file transfer access and
management (FTAM) for OSI-based information
systems. TCP/IP protocol is well suited protocol
for data transfer and communications.

2.4

Remote Electronic Information
Access and Retrieval

Remote electronic access is user's ability to
make use of an information provider's services
at a distance. It enables information to
economise their operations without eliminating
access for distant users. Thus, a large number of
users can be served without extensive need to
travel.
While remote access technology requires
information specialist training. Electronic remote
access requires user training, computer
professionals and also user's data terminals for
connection via a modem and telephone lines or
data networks. Electronic remote access also
implies
a
reliable,
highquality
telecommunication infrastructure.

2.5

Digital Convergence and
Connectivity

Digital convergence is .the technological
merger of several technologies in the form of
various devices for exchanging information in
the electronic, or digital format used by the
computers. The industries are computers,
communications,
consumer
electronics,
entertainment and mass media.

Wired or wireless communications links
offer several options for information- and
communication. The ability to connect
communication devices by telecommunications
lines to other devices and sources of
information, known as connectivity, provides
number of services such as telephone related
services-fax,
voice
mail,
e-mail,
teleconferencing, video conferencing, resource
sharing, electronic data exchange, online
information services for research, e-rnail, games,
electronic bulletin boards ,services (BBSs),
global Internet for information gathering,
discussion and new groups. In future, these
technologies can engage in interactive TV or
video through set-top boxes, picture phones
and TV/PCs.

2.6

ISDN

ISDN
is
a
set
of
international
communication standards for transmitting voice,
video, text, images and data simultaneously as
digital signals over twisted-pair telephone lines.
The main benefit of ISDN is speed. It allows
people to send digital data ten times faster than
the modern modems deliver on the analog
voice network.

2.7

Virtual Global University

By using IT like video networks or virtual
classrooms the distance learning would replace
lecture halls and scheduled class time-tables.
Students can take video field trips to distant
places and get information from remote
information centres and libraries. lnformation
technologies link information providers and
researchers.

USE OF IT IN LEADING
I N D I A N LIBRARIES

A survey to determine the potential use,
non-use of information technology by users.and
library professionals to solicit their opinions,
and to know the availability of each information
technology services/facility in their libraries
documentatiorr centres (including DESIDOC,
INSDOC, NASSDOC, National Council of
Applied Economic Research, American Center
Library and British Council Library) was
conducted. The objective of this survey was to

CONCLUSION

The transfer and diffusion of electronic
information
in
providing value added
information services is central to the success of
the
information technologists,
computer
engineers and software
specialists. Better
understanding the generation, transfer, diffusion
and use of electronic information is an
important component of the strategies used by
IT industry would contribute to increase the
productivity,
stimulating innovation, and
improving the professional competence of
