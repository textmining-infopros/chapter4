Multimedia Information Resources Available on
Internet in Libraries
Compiled by
Dr CK Ramaiah*
The popularity of the world wide web and
the incredible rapid growth of the web
technology could not be imagined a decade
ago. Web is a globally hyperlinked electronic
environment on which a lot of latest
information is available in almost all subject
areas. Keeping this in mind, an exhaustive
information search was conducted on lnternet
to compile a list-of various web sites providing
information on the use of multimedia systems
for library applications.
This list is organised in four sections which
contains selected library related multimedia
resources available on the internet. These
include full text of the papers presented in
conferences; reports, media resources, digital &
virtual libraries available on Internet, important
multimedia applications, multimedia collections
of different libraries, internet-based multimedia
library services, etc.

(1) Multimedia Digital' Libraries: digital
multimedia libraries, digital li6rary services,
interactive multimedia online services, etc.,
available on internet.
(2) Integrating Multimedia into Libraries
Management and Access Issues: issues
related to management and access of
multimedia digital libraries are listed in this
section. Also included several conference
reports, papers, internet site address where
multimedia links are given, conference
lecture presentations and multimedia
conferencing applications archives.
(3) Instructional Multimedia Resources on
web: multimedia instructional & training

presentations,
instructional aids are also given in this
section.

titles, pu8lishers, frequency, type and the
