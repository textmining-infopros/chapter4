Ahmedabad Library Network-ADINET
SR Thakore*
ABSTRACT

The paper describes the databases being developed by ADINET and
the information and communication services it presently offers and
plans to offer in the near future to its member libraries and other
users. ADINET, although a very recently started network (formally
inaugurated in February 1995), has taken quite a few initiatives to
play a very useful role in library resource sharing and in information
dissemination.

1. INTRODUCTION
Ahmedabad Library Network (ADINET)
was formally inaugurated in February, 1995
when a Memorandum of Understanding
was
signed
between
the
National
Information System for Science and
Technology (NISSAT) and ADlNET at
Ahmedabad. ADINET is the fifth library
network sponsored by NISSAT in the
country and aims to bring about
cooperative mode of working amongst
more than 150 libraries and information
centres in and around Ahmedabad. Using
modern tools of information technology,
AOINET will not only help library users but
individuak too, of different professions in
getting access to information of their
interest. Coordinated efforts for suitable
collection development will result in
sizeable
reduction
of

duplication of subscriptions. E-mail facility
being provided by ADINET will enable the
members to exchange information with
others within the city and outside.

2. DATABASE ACTIVITIES
Creation of a centralised database, i.e., a
union catalogue of holdings of libraries in
Ahmedabad i s an important activity of
ADINET. The centralised database will
contain a number of databases pertaining
to serials, books, theses/dissertations,
non-book material and subject experts with
their fields of specialisatior;. Inputs are
collected from various libraries in whatever
format/medium they are available and then
they are keyed in the ADINET host
computer
as
per
standard
format
recommended by INFLIBNET to maintain
uniformity.
In a short span of less than a year, the
following databases have been created and
are being constaitly updated.

2.1

- Ahmedabad Library Network-ADINET

Institute Master

This database contains information
about
74 libraries in Ahmedabad.
Information about more libraries will be
added in phases.

2.2

Journal Master

This
database
presently contains
bibliographic
information
about
serials/journals titles currently subscribed by
74 libraries of Ahmedabad for the year
1995. The contents pages of journals,
abstracts of articles, and inclusion of back
volumes will be taken up gradually.

2.3

Book Master

Generation of Union Catalogue of
Books is a herculean task due to the sheer
number of books to be entered in
computer after filling up the mandatory
fields and authenticating each entry against
any mistakes. In the first phase it i s
proposed to collect book data from about
ten libraries in Ahmedabad which are
already computerised and enter ih6m into
the host computer.

3. SERVICES
Services to be offered by ADINET can
broadly be categorised as under.

3.1

Library Related Services

ADINET will enable libraries to give the
following services to users more effectively.
3.1.1 On-iine lnformaticn Search

Information can be searched by the
participating libraries by accessing the
Union Catalogue database. This catalogue
initially wili have the holdings of periodicals
only. Gradually holdings of books,
dissertations,
reports and
important
non-book materials will also be added to it.
58

3.1.2 infer-Library Loan

ADINET will enable a user to find the
location of a periodicals/books/reports of
his interest Once located, they can then be
borrowed on inter-library loan.
3.1.3 Photocopying Service

When requests are received for journal
articles, they can be photocopied and sent
to other libraries at specified cost.
The Inter-library document
service has been started.

delivery

3.1.4 Current Awareness Service

Current awareness service can also be
provided from cominercial databases which
are availab!e in some libraries in mach!ne
readab!e form.
3.1.5 information Service

By generating usefu! databases and
procuring commercial databases, all the
members can be provided access to the
latest biblio~raphicand factual information.

3.2

Other Services

3.2.1 E-mail Service

INFLIBNET has already installed an
e-mail software in its computer. Mall boxes
for ADINET members can be opened in this
computer. jilst by dialling into the
INFLIBNET e-mail number, one can post
messages mean: for other members 2nd at
the same tinie reiiieve messages received
from others. This service will be of
particular help in case an institution wants
to send notices/messager to several
institutions. It i s proposed to subscribe to
ERNET so that ADINET members can
excharlge e-mail with others in India or
even abroad.

3.2.2 Bulk fin Board Service
information about popular lectures/talks,
conferences, seminars, etc. which are

organised by various institutions can be
given on a bulletin board. ADlNET will
provide a facility for posting notices about
such events so that others can read them.
Members can also highlight some
breakthroughs achieved by them or pose
problems faced by them on bulletin board
so that other members working on similar
fields can respond.

4. P R O M O T I O N O F LIBRARY
AUTOMATION
Library automation has two main
components viz.; (i) Computerisarion and
(ii) Networking. Computerisation would
greatly help a library to offer speedier
services to users and strearnline various
library operations. But for accessing other
libraries/infoi.mation
centresjdatabases,
networking i s required. Library may have
computers and networi<s but exchange of
information
also
depends
on
the
cooperation and willirlgness of librarians.
For a city library network to succeed, there
bzs to be cooperation among the librarians.
To irlctilcatc the spirit of cooperation and
spread awareness about library automation,
ADIKET provides a platform to librarians of
Ahmedabad to interact. This is done
through monthly meetings held at different
institutions.
For most of the libraries in Ahmedabad,
computerisation is a new work culture
altogether. Library professionals need to be
trained in this area while the users are to be
educc~tedin the use of computerised
libraries and information centres. This i s an
important activity without which library
automation will not succeed. ADlNET
therefore,
organises
various
training
programs at nominal charges for the benefit
of library pr~fessionalsand others. Training
programs on use of CDS/ISIS for library
coniputerisation and e-mail have been
organised in last one year. A workshop on
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Jechnol. 1996.16(2)

AACR - 2 i s planned for the near future.
Such training programs will be a regular
activity of ADlNET in future.
To help the libraries in avoiding
unnecessary duplication in the journal
acquisitions,
ADlNET
compiles
and
circulates every year a union list of current
periodicals
in
Ahmedabad
libraries.
However, such reductiol: ; duplication can
be achieved only if the libraries are sure of
getting copies of the journal articles
promptly from other libraries. Towards this,
ADINET has started a document supply
service through which libraries can get
documents from other libraries without
employing their own scarce manpower for
the work.
For information exchange, ADINET with
the help of NISSAT has initiated steps to
provide e-mail facilities to 30 Ahmedabad
libraries this year using ERNET of DOE. A
list of the Ahmedabad institutions whose
libraries will be provided with this facility is
given in Annexure - I.

5. F U N D I N G
ADINFT is promoted by NISSAT which
has provided grants for the establishment
and operation for the first two years. The
only other source of funding i s through
annual subscriptions from members.

7. PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED
One of the major problems faced by
ADINET in the initial stages of central
database creation was getting inpuis from
different libraries. Postal requests to
librarians to send their library data to
ADINET hardly elicited any response.
Reminders too were of no use. This
problem was solved by sending persons to
various libraries for collecting data. Monthly
meetings too helped a lot in this matter.
Many libraries do not have computers.
They send data in, either typed or
handwritten form. Further they cover very
few fields. This increases data entry

workload at ADINET. But these problems
will gradually ease as more and more
libraries get computerised.
Another
major
problem
is
non-availability of telephone connections in
libraries. Most of the libraries do not have
direct telephone connections. Even after
applying for a telephone connection it is
impossible to guess as to when the library
will get such connection.
Since city library networks like ADINET
do not receive any grants (except from
NISSAT for first two years), it is impossible
to recruit staff on regular basis. Mere
subscriptions are not of much help. So,
work has to be carried out with persons
employed on fixed stipend who are always
on the look out for permanent jobs. So, the
work suffers due to frequent change of
employees.

8. CBNCLUSlON
ADINET i s a recent city library nztwcrk.
A lot of progress has been made in the first
year itself since its establishn?erlt. Sc.-!c
initial problems have been oic:cc.ne.
lnspite of sonle handicaps effo, t s are being
made to make ;t a truly useiuinework.
