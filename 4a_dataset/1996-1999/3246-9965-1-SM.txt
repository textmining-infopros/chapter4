ABSTRACT
The paper describe the objectives, topical content, and reasons for
developing a course on digital libraries. The Internet is changing the
way librarians view information sources. The idea of the library as a
place is being questioned while the 'library without walls" is rapidly
emerging. The course provides a broad overview of technicai and
professional issues related to digital libraries. It leads students through
a theoretical discussion o f various facets, and gives practical
experiences with tools necessary for creation and use of information
resources in networked digital formats.

1.

THE ACADEMIC SETTING

The State University o f New York at
Buffalo (SUNY at Buffalo), of which the
School of lnformation and Library Studies
is ranked among the
(SILS) is a part,
top public research universities in the
US. It has more than 27,000 students
and 4500 faculty and offers 91
undergraduate, 99 master's and 90
doctoral degree programs. SUNY at
Buffalo is a member of the prestigious
Association of American Universities.
The School of lnformation and Library
Studies (SILS) is one of about 15 major
academic ilnits within SUNY at Buffalo.
Communication should be addressed to :
A Neil Yerkey, School of lnformation and Library Studies
379 Baldy Hall, SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA

Its primary function is to prepare
graduates for positions in all types of
libraries and information agencies. In
addition,
it
grants a Post-Master's
Certificate and has a joint doctoral
program with the School of Education.
It is moving toward establishing its own
doctoral
program
in
library
and
information studies, and has recently
established the Centre for Applied
Research in Library and lnformation
Science to co-ordinate and conduct
research of practical benefit to libraries.
It currently has about 252 students in
its master's level program. SILS is fully
accredited by the American Library
Association.

Yerkey - Course in Digital Libraries

One of the foundationzl philosophies
of SlLS has been to develop a curriculum
that reflects the merging of the science
and technology of information, print,
non-print, and computer media within
librarianship. It was one of the first
library schools to offer courses on online
searching when that technology was in
its infancy. Besides teaching students how
to use technology within libraries, SlLS
also recognised the need to train people
to understand, work with, and contribute
expertise to the 7nformatization1of society
outside the library walls.

2. CHANGES IN LIBRARIANSHIP
Librarians have been moving away
from the idea of the library as a
storehouse of information, and toward
the idea of libraries as places where
information is managed (11- Librarians
embraced 'newer media' such as films,
filmstrips, video and audio cassettes. They
realised that information was contained
in many forms other than print on paper.
Even so, the profession until recently
viewed the library as a place where
information 'containers' are acquired,
organised, shelved, and retrieved.
More recently, librarians began to use
online search database systems, such as
Dialogue and Medline, to extend the
boundaries of the library's resources. They
embraced remote, shared systems like
OCLC, and developed online public
access
catalogues
(OPACs)
with
connections to the OPACs of other
libraries. The walls of the library began
to be less solid. Still, until recently,
librarians were mostly concerned with
containers. They thought of information
as a thing and efforts were directed
toward organising the things that contain
information. Even the goal of newer

techniques like online searching was
ultimately to help retrieve things like
articles, reports, and books [2]. Only
very recently, due to the emergence of
global networks, have librarians had the
capability to conduct real information
retrieval, as opposed to container retrieval.

3. THE lNTERNET
The Internet is changing the way we
view information sources. Not on$y i s
the idea of the library as a place being
questioned, but librarians are finding they
must learn how to organise, manage,
use, and provide access to containerless
data and ideas. Personal computers are
now usually part of a network of
computers and often part of a network
of networks, spanning the globe. Until
recently, the few who were experimenting
with networks were computer scientists,
government-sponsored researchers, and
hobbyists
who
could
brave
the
complexities of the newly emerging global
village. For most it was out of reach,
economically and practically.
Now, interconnectivity is much more
widespread. Computers are less expensive,
people are becoming more computer
literate, and systems are becoming simpler
and more accessible. These changes have
far-reaching implications for the workplace
and society. Computers are changing the
way we communicate and how we think
about intellectual property and the
ownership of information. It is forcing
us to re-examine our ideas about
information, libraries, and librarianship.
The lnternet is not the first or only
computer network. It i s certainly not the
best organised, or the easiest to use. It
can best be described as a sprawling
mass 0.f computer connections that

Yerkey - Course in Digital Libraries

somehow works. It is the first attempt
at a "Global Network," connecting millions
of computers in more than 50 countries
(100 more countries have some kind of
indirect connection).
It is actually not
a single network, but many regional
networks connected by a backbone of
several
supercomputers
which
communicate via satellite and fiber. More
importantly, the Internet is a community
of 20 million people, and a vast library
of information. People around the world
are able to contribute their. thoughts and
knowledge to the community, and
everyone else can draw off their
knowledge 131.
Some of the services provided on the
Internet are:

Archives : Holdings of bibliographies,
documents, newsletters, software, and the
like.

Recently, the idea of the "digital library"
has moved to the forefront o i discussion
and research. This was due in part to
the activities of the Library o i Congress
in helping to establish a National Digrtal
Library Federation. In ,Mav 1 995, the
Commission on Preservation ~ n d,.lccess

Yerkey - Course in Digitai Libraries

(a private organisation whose mission is
to develop and support :oilaboration
among libraries to ensure a( ccss to and
preservation of resources in ail formats),
the Library of Congress, and 14 other
research libraries signed :he National
Digital Library Federation Agreement [4].
The purpose was to "bring together-from
across the nation and beyond-digitised
materials that will be made accessible
to
students,
scholars
and
citizens
everywhereVRef 4, p. 251). The
participants
agreed
to
establish
a
collaborative
management
structure,
develop a co-ordinated approach to
fund-raising, and formulate cooperative
selection guidelines.

Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA),
through
a
joint
initiative,
announced the funding of several digital
library development projects,
mostly
among academic institutions. The focus
of the digital library initiative is to
dramatically advance the means to collect,
store, and organise information in digital
forms, and make i t available for searching,
retrieval,
and
processing
via
communication networks. Each project is
described briefly below. (More information
may be found at the World Wide Web
addresses (URCS)shown.) The differences
in how the grantees define "digital library"
are especially instructive.

+ The
The Library of Congress has long
maintained many information resources
on the Internet. These include electronic
exhibits, the American Memory Project,
ftp sites, country studies, LC Online,
indexes to Federal Government resources,
and a link to the Library's Thomas
Legislative System. More recently it has
embarked on a plan to digitise its
collections relating to American history.
It has also been addressing copyright
issues through development of an
electronic copyright management program
1-51.
Other libraries have embarked on similar
projects. The British Library began an
in 1993 to
"Initiatives for Access>roject
investigate hardware and software platforms
for the digitization and subsequent
networking of a range of library materials. It
includes a patent information system,
"Electronic Beowulf" digital manuscript,
photographic collections, and an OPAC [ 6 ] .

On September 27, 1994, the National
Science Foundation (NSF), the Department
of Defence Advanced Research Projects
Agency
(ARPA),
and
the
National

University of hllichigan project
defines digital libraries as "electronic
libraries in which large numbers of
geographically distributed users can
access the contents of large and diverse
repositories of electronic objects.
Electronic objects include networked text,
images, maps, sounds, videos, catalogues
of merchandise, and scientific, business,
and government datasets. It w i l l
concentrate on earth and space sciences
(URL:http://http2. sils.umich.edu/UMDL/
HomePage.html)."

e Stanford University i s developing the
enabling technologies for a single,
integrated, virtual library, allowing users to
access information through in~rfacesthat
hide the unimportant details of diversity of
materials and provide ways to navigate
and manage the information space in a
consistent and unified way. Stanford's
project will include a mix of virtual and
traditional libraries (URL: http://www-

diglib.stanford.edu/diglib).
e The University of California at Berkeley is
producing a prototype digital library with
a focus on environmental information. its
goal is to develop a system in which large

Yerkey - Course in Digital Libraries

numbers of geographically distributed
users can conveniently access the entire
contents of very large and diverse
repositories of electronic objects. These
repositories will exist i n locations
physically near or remote from the users,
and will contain objects comprising text,
images, maps, sounds, full-motion videos,
merchandise catalogues, scientific and
business data sets, as well as hypertextual
compositions of such elements (URL:
http://elib.cs.berkeiy.edu).

As can be seen, the terminology is by
no means settled. Drabenstott [7j points
out that the literature contains words
like "digital library," "electronic library,"
"virtual library," "library without walls," and
"ionic library " to refer to the library
of the future. Additionally, these terms
have different meanings among the
different interested parties involved:
To some i t suggests computerisation of
traditional libraries. To others, i t calls for
carrying out of the functions of libraries
in a new way, encompassing new types
of information resources; new approaches to acquisition, cataloguing, interaction,
etc.
To
computer
professionals it is a distributed text-based
or multimedia information system. Some
see it as linked multimedia objects that
encompass humanity's store of information. Some see digital libraries as the
space in which people communicate,
share, and produce new knowledge and
knowledge products (81.

a The University of Illinois believes the
international network will evolve from
distributed computer nodes to distributed
information sources supporting object
interaction. Users will browse the Net by
searching digital libraries and navigating
relationship links, as well as share new
information within the Net by composing
and publishing new objects and links. The
Net will thus appear as interconnected
spaces of information objects (URL:http:/
/www.grainger.uiucedu/dli).
a Carnegie Melion University is developing
an online digital video library, allowing
users to access, explore and retrieve
science and mathematics materials from
video libraries. This project is more
concerned with connecting to an existing
storehouse and accessing the information
in television videos (URL:http://fuzine.
mt.cs. cmu.edu/im/iformedia.html).
et

The University of California at Santa
Barbara is working on a project called
Project Alexandria which is primarily
concerned with maps and geographical
images and geographical information
systems (URL:http://alexandria.sdc.ucsb.
edu).

These project descriptions demonstrate
the emergence of a new paradigm for
information storage, access, and deliverythat of the "virtual* or "digitalVibrary.
DESIDOC Bulletin of lnf Techno/,1996,16(1)

This statement reflects two different
but complimentary ways of thinking about
the concept. One i s to think in terms
of digital products in traditional libraries.
That is, the definition of a digital library
is a more or less traditional library that
uses CD ROMs, online searching, online
public access catalogues, e-mail, and
other electronic products and tools to
serve its clientele. Indeed, libraries are
increasingly using digital products, tools,
and resources to serve very traditional
functions. Part of the ever-growing body
of literature i s concerned with the issues
revolving around this side of the concept

191.
The other approach i s to think more
in terms of virtual libraries. This approach
focuses not on traditional libraries in
library buildings, but rather on online
35

ie in Digital libraries

information resources used by people in
all kinds of settings. Virtual libraries
sometimes "look" like traditional libraries.
An exariple is the Internet Public Library
developed by the University of Michigan
School of lnformation and Library Science
(URL:
http://ipl.umich.edu).
More
typically, virtual libraries are personal, ad
hoc creations, developed to meet the
informational and recreational needs of
one individual or a small group. They
might be related to a specific project
or developed and maintained throughout
a lifetime of research and interest by
an individual. Or, virtual libraries might
be developed for public use in much
the same way public libraries have been
developed.
There are, however, commonalties
among the variety of projects and the
multiple definitions being offered for the
"digital" or "virtual" library:

e Geographically distributed users.

e Barge and diverse collections.
+a information represented by a variety of

electronic objects.
5

"Seamless" access.

McClure has pointed out that "the
virtual library would allow users to
seamlessly connect and interact with
information with no regard to geographic

location or time"101.
no containers, no staff. Librarians of the
digital library of the future should assume
the role of information manager, both
in creating and facilitating access to a
variety of information objects across
multiple platforms.
Libraries as places will continue to
serve useful informational and communal
functicns. Also, containers of information

will be around for a long time, and
they will continue to be seiected,
acquired,
catalogued,
indexed,
and
referred to. In fact, among the definitions
and descriptions of digital libraries,
Nunberg describes the electronic library
as :
An aggregation of catalogues, lists, and
indexes o f documents o f every
imaginable type, organised according to
myriad schemes of classification, and
linked and cross-indexed for searching,
so that they come to behave as a single
database in which the lines between
individual collection and catalogues are
blurred [I 1 1.

5. COURSE DESCRIPTION
Because we believe traditional libraries
will be part of the mix, the course in
Digital Libraries developed at SlLS includes
some discussion of the impact of digital
products in traditional library settings but
emphasises the changes being instituted
by the creation of virtual libraries on
existing cultural, social, organisational,
economic, intellectual, and technical
infrastructures for information delivery.
Students taking the course will acquire
the skills necessary to develop, organise,
use,
and
evaluate
the
electronic
information products which comprise
digital libraries.
As a working definition for the course,
we define digital libraries as electronic
libraries in which large numbers of
geographically distributed users can access
the contents of large and diverse
electronic
objects.
repositories
of
Electronic objects include networked text,

fair use, collection development, and
information mediation.

The course provides a broad overview
of technical and professional issues related
to digital libraries. It provides both
theoretical discussion of various facets,
and practical experiences with the tools
necessary for creation and use of
information resources in networked digital
formats.

e Understand technicat aspects related to
storage, transmission, and retrieval of
digital information, such as networking,
protocols, client/server environments,
digital storage formats, compression,
retrieval, and presentation.

This course was offered as a three
credit-hour, 15 week course at the
Master's level. Students were expected
to already have an understanding of
basic Internet resources such as e-mail
and bulletin boards or listservs.
Most
of the class time was spent in lecture,
discussion, and presentations by outside
experts. Some class time was used for
hands-on instruction and demonstrations,
and there were a few field trips to view
digital projects in the area.
The main project for the course
consisted of working in small groups to
develop a digital product or virtual
information
structure.
The
projects
consisted of creating World Wide Web
pages for area libraries or other
information
agencies,
developing
information areas on the Buffalo Free-Net,
creating digital multimedia programs, and
the like. Students also wrote individual
papers describing the process, and each
group conducted a class demonstration
and presentation of its projects.

The course outline presented above
attempts to balance breadth s f coverage
of the many issues involved in creating
digital libraries with exploration of
particular issues and techniques through
additional readings, assignments and
projects.
The technology continues to
change rapidly; therefore the course
emphasises acquainting students with the
broader organisational, social, economic,
and cultural contexts within which
decisions concerning digital information
products must be made, rather than
focusing
on
specific
technical
implementations.
Peter Graham reminds us that libraries,
digital or traditional, must be committed
to organising, storing and providing
information for periods of time longer
than human lives. They are not simply
networks full of databases nor buildings
full of books; they should be organisations
designed for the long term 1121, We
believe this perspective is necessary if
the digital libraries of the future are to
be designed to truly serve the needs
of information seekers rather than to
simply seek the limits of what is
technically feasible.
