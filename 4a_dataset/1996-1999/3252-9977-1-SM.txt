DELNET : The First Operational Library Network in lndia
HK Kaul*
ABSTRACT
This article describes the objectives and establishment of DELNET.
Various activities of DELNET, such as, promotions of database
creation among member lib:rries, resource sharing and
standardisation are discussed. lnformation o n funding and the
hardware/software infrastructure i s also provided along with
databases and services.

In Delhi, libraries have been growing
very fast in number and size during the last
four decades. They cater to the specialised
and general clientele and are of various
types. These include institutional libraries,
research libraries, government libraries,
public libraries, departmental libraries
besides the libraries of the universities,
colfeges and schools. During the recent
years, increase in information has led to
increase in the demands of the users. It has
been noticed that in this era of information
explosion, libraries in lndia are generally
ill-equipped to handle and retrieve
information effectively. The financial
resources and the space requirement for
housing library collections are limited in
almost all of the iibraries. The option left
with the forward looking librarians has been
to promote the sharing of resources by
automation and networking. With this

objective, in January 1988, the india
International Centre initiated'efforts for the
establishment of Delhi Library Network
(DELNET).
DELNET is the first operational library
India. Sponsored by the
network i
National Information System for Science
and Technology (NISSAT), Department of
Science and Technology, Covt. of India, it
was started as a project of the lndia
Internatitanal Centre in 1988 and later
officially registered as a society in )une
1992.

The main objectives of DELNET are to
promote sharing of resources among the
libraries by developing a network of
libraries,
storing
and
disseminating
information,
offering
computerised
information services to users, and to
coordinate efforts of suitable collection
development and reducing unrlecessary
duplication wherever possible.

PJESSAT had gEVe6 ggeanls for projects,
supplied madems and s s f ~ a r e ,and paid
for the EWNEY ernail connectivity. This
funding was good for activating interest in
neworking. Fin&9lg/, for making DELNET
operationak, National Bnfoamaties Centre
(NiC) provided hardware, s ~ f ~ a rand
e
financial assistance for recruiting staff,
internet access, etc.
DELNn is presently supported @f
NlC,
Planning Com:~ission through its grarts.
The India International Centre has atlotted
space and other Facidikies wit hi^ its
premises.

D E L N n at present has 57 libraries as its
members. The libraries that have more than
10,000 books are taken as I~stitutiona!
Members and those that have less than
10,080 are given Associate Institutional
Membership. DELNET has 50 institutional
members and seven associate institutional
members. The membership is progressively
increasing and
includes
universities,
embassies,
colleges,
government
departments,
institutio~s awd
public
libraries. Some institutions from far off
places like Sb?irnla, Bhopal and Psndicherry

Rave aiso joined DELNEG as members. A fist
of DELNR members is given
in Annexure-E.

The feasibility report was compieted in
1990. Thirty five libraries were included it1
the survey for the purpose of the report.
Efforts were later made to implement the
recommendations of the report in phases.
The '0 Phase' was subsequently prefixed to
these phases to include establishment of
e-maii facility. However, departures were
made in the implementation of the project
due the meagre financial inp~ttsavailable
and the siow growth of membership and
also to suit the demands of the users.

hoped that in the years to come, DELNET
would be able to save more foreign
exchange for the country through sharing of
periodical resources .
in 1991, a courier service was started on
contract with a private agency for inter
library lending among the participating
libraries but it was not very effective.
Recently, DELNET has introduced its own
courier service with the financial help of
NIC. It is hoped that the service will be
well-used by the libraries.

5.3

Standardisation

A standardisation committee of DELNET
has been meeting from time to time with
the chairmanship of Dr SS Murthy of
DESIDOC, DRDO. The standardisation
committee decided for standardisation in
the following areas:

I.

Communication format for intercha;ige
of bibliographic data,

m) Inter-library loan and user services,

2.

Input output format,

n) Document transfer/copying facidities, and

3.

o) Access to iocal, national and international
databases.

Resource Sharing

DELNET established a Committee on the
'rationalisation of acquisition of foreign
periodicals' in Delhi libra.ries as per the
guidelines of NISSAT. Efforts of the
Committee led to saving foreign exchange
worth Rs. 10 million by rationalising
subscriptions to foreign periodicals for
1991, 1992, and 1993 through resource
sharing.
This was mainly achieved in the fields of
physical sciences, medical sciences, and
agricultural sciences. The Chairman of the
sub-committees for these disciplines took
keen
interest
in the
rationalisation
programme. The committee is now calied
Committee on Resource ,Sharing. It is

It was felt that standardisation in case o i

standards in the beginning. It was decided
that the classification schemes generally in
use in the lndian libraries were Colon,
Classification,
Universal
Decimal
Classification,
and
Dewey
Decimal
Classification.
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
impose
a
standard
classification scheme on all libraries. About
80 percent of the requests received by
OCLC were either by author or by title as
revealed by Mr Frederick Kilgore, past
president of the OCLC, at a DELNET
meeting, the committee felt that a similar
pattern of requests may emerge in DELNFT
aiso. Out of the remaining 20 percent of
the requests, about 15 percent would be by
subject headings. For searches by class
numbers, of all the three schemes, the
participating library could search by the
classification numbers or it could pass on
such requests fo DELNET central office for
necessary action.
It was
therefore
considered that it would not be necessary
to impose a standard classification scheme
on the participating libraries. Hovever,
preference i s given to Dewey numbers in
the DELNET union catalogue.
With regard to the standardisation of
subject headings and the creation of
thesaurus for DELNET, the committee
decided that LCSH would be used primarily.
Specialised libraries may use additional
thesauri that are availab[e in each major
discipline such as social sciences,
humanities and science and technology. It
was considered that a thesaurus for
DELNET would eventually be created that

lndian terms also.

Databases Created

5.4

DELNET has so far created four
databases which are available online to
member libraries and other DELN'ETusers.

This union catalogue is growing in size.
A user can get information by author, title,
subject, descriptors and Dewey class
numbers. At present, the union catalogue of
books has 1,68,253 bibliographic records
with 1,76,297 locations data in it. By March
1997 about four lakh additional records will
be added to the union catalogue.

5.4.2 Union List sf Current Serials
DELNET created in 1991, a union list of
current serials available in Delhi libraries,
with the support of NISSAT and with the

it has been found that eofiecting data

of two bibliographers and one data input

The standard cost for each entry sf book

without his involvement it was Rs. 7.02.
Keeping in view the demands for r e m

is getting ready. DELNET software team
has to be constantly in touch with more
experienced software experts from time to
time.
a+ The staff that work for six months or more
with DELNET start getting offers of
permanent positions from other
organisations with more salaries. We
frequently recruit, and train new staff but
find it hard to retain them. Also, since
DELNET is under a project, it is unable to
attract well-trained library professionals
who are equally good at computer
applications and communication.
+B

Lease lines and the telephone lines, when
out of order, create a great pressure as
complaints rise from users of e-mail and
union catalogue.

t~ Library staff in member-libraries many a

tirne carry out adjustments in modems or
computers causing temporary stoppage,
which result in more pressure on the e-mail
unit of DELNET.

7. CONCLUSION
t i may be mentioned that DELNET has
emerged as the first operational cooperative
network incorporating all the disciplines-

DESlDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 1996. 16(2)

Science and Technology, Social Sciences
and Humanities-in
its
ambit. Each
member-library is contributing towards the
progress of DELNET. More attention is
being now devoted to the monitoring of the
standards of the bibliographic databases
that are being created in different member
libraries in Delhi. Without maintaining
adequate standards, it would be impossible
to merge the databases into a single
DELNET daiabase. We therefore hope that
as the work progresses further, the DELKET
user
librarians
will become more
conversant with the technology, standards,
use of e-rnaii, and networking. DELNET
database are ilsed not only by the libraiians
and schoiars in Delhi but also by those
outside Delhi.

The growth of DELNR- has been
evolutionary in nature. It took us nearly
eight years in the promotional process. We
hope that the efforts made by DELNET and
the participating i~stitutionswiJl result in
ensuring a siubstantiaf growth of DELNFT in
the corning years with additional o ~ f i n e
databases, more data added to the existing
databases, and wiih the avaiiability of
or'ine
access
through
internet
to
iaternationai databases.
