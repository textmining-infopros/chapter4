INTRODUCTION

Design and development activity of library
software packages in India started in a big way
during mideighties with the introduction of
CDS/ISIS software package of UNESCO in
Mian libraries by the National Information
System on Science and Technology (NISSAT),
New Delhi. NlSSAT organised a number of
short term training courses on applications of
CDS/ISIS on library and information activities to
make senior professionals aware of the benefits
of amputerisation in libraries, to train library
staff to make it operational in the libraries and
to develop computer culture among the
librarians and information scientists From the
experience of use of CDS/ISIS, MINISIS, etc.,
m e of the libraries and information centres
dcweloped/got developed their own software,
such as DESIDOC developed Defence Library
Management System (DELMS) during 1988 in
COBOL language under multiuser Unix
environment and implemented it at Defence

Science Library (DSL) in DESIDOC. Also
Catman was developed by the lndian National
Scientific Documentation Centre (INSDOC),
New Oelhi and implemented at National
Science Library (NSL) in INSDOC. Sanjay
package was developed for small libraries by
DESIDOC under NISSAT project to popularise
COS/tSIS and to develop a model automated
library by implementing it at Technology
Bhawan Library in DST, New Delhi, etc. Now,
libraries are fully aware about the needs of
computerisation and many software packages
are available for their use depending upon the
needs. However, selection of a suitable
software for library is a problem because of lack
of good, and uptodate comparative studies on
software packages. Thus, some attempts have
been made here to evaluate some of the
software packages used ih indian libraries and
information centres based on published
literature, demonstration in conterences.
practical experience, personal discussions, e:c
This study may help other libraries in selectir:g
the software for their automation.

LIBRARY SOFTWARE
PACKAGES IN INDIAN
LIBRARIES

Besides CDS/ISIS, Minisis, etc., a number of
library software packages have been designed
and developed indigenously'd
and these are

being used in various Indian libraries a*
information centres. Some of the libran,
software packages are given in Table 1.
Since there are many software packages and
mav not be possible to
all the
software packages in detail) only a few selected
software packages including recently developed
ones are discussed below i n brief:

D ModularitpThe package comprises seven
modules (Data administration, query,
circulation, acquisition, serials control,
technical processing and library
administration) designed to handle all
functions of a library and information centre.
Since the package has different modules, the
library can implement complete package or
acquire stand-alone module(s) depending
upon the needs of library to implement, and
remaining mod,ules can be implemented and
integrated with the existing module(s) as and
when need arises.

0 Object Oriented Design-The package has
been developed based on object-oriented
design which offers qualitatively superior end
product.

a CCf Compatibility-The

package adopts
common communication format (CCF). It
incorporates all mandatory fields of CCF
which facilitates irnportlexport of data from/
to Granthalaya to/from various platforms.
Export and import of data to and from ISO2709 and ASCtl format is possible.

a Dictionary Concept--Dictionary facility is
providedin the package for data elements like
publishers, keywords, accompanying
materials, etc.

a Powerful Query and Search Facilifies-The
package is provided with sophisticated tools
for retrieval of information by different search
parameters. Search can he conducted by
using boolean logic operators. Search terms
can be typed or selectedthrough dictionaries.

o Ease of use-The package is easy to learn and
use. It provides on screen nlessages to help
users.
INSOOC is marketing and promoting this
package for library automation in India. The
11

package has already been implemented at

2.7 Suchika (ver 1.O)
Suchika is an integrated software package
for library automation, designed and developed
during 1996 by the Defence Scientific
Information
&
Documentation
Centre
(DESIDOC), Delhi for its Defence Science
Library and other libraries/technical information
centres (TICS) of Defence Research &
Development Organisation (DRDO), scattered
ail over India. The purpose of developing this
software is to auiomate all the DRDO
fibraries/rlCS, to create and maintain a DRDO
libtaries holdings' database and help the
libraries to folbw uniform standard practices.
The package has been developed in C*
languzge in MSDOS and UNiX versions
keeping in view the requirements of big and
small libraries of DRDO. The package is menudriven and user-friendly. The package conforms
to international standards like Common
Communication Format (CCF), lS0-270%
AACR2 and allovrs data conversic;n from
CDS/ISIS, etc.
Suchika has powerful search facilities
Search can be conducted on any field by
specifying the field(s) or through the various
indexes like author, subject, keywords, report
no., patent no., etc. Query may be typed or
selected by using the concerned index. Boolean
search operators can also be used. Suchika also
provides facility for free text searching. search
results can be displayed according to desired
format, and after s k ~ e c t i nthe
~ relevant record?
printouts can also be taken. Suchika has inbull1

facility for data validation and data-duplication
checking. This package has been developed in
modular form, such as acquisition, circulation,
OPAC, serials control modules. Therefore, its
implementation is quite easy. Either all the
modules may be implemented at one time, or
module-wise implementation can also be made
depending upon the needs of library. The
package (both DOS and UNlX versions) has
been implemented at Defence Science Library
and it is under implementation in other DRDC!
IibrariesfllCs. DESIDOC, being a Government
agency, has decided to offer this software
package to non-DRDO libraries also at nominal
price to help them in their automation.

EVALUATION OF SOFTWARE

Evaluation of library software package is a
very complex process. For evaluation of
packages, all the packages must be used by the
evaluation team under the same conditions but
it may not be possible practically due to various
factors. CDS/4SIS and MlNiSlS are not included
here for evaluation because these software
packages are well known internationally and a
lot of literature has already been published on
these software packages. Some attempts have
been made earlier on the evaluation of library
software pa~kages"~'but after that many
software packages have been added and their
evaluation is not available. Thus, attempts have
been made here to evaluate a few important
software packages on the basis of published
literature, demonstration of software packages
in conferences/exhibit~ons and practical use,
etc The software packages are evaluated here
from the aspects of hardware requirements,
operating system platform, language of
development, various facilities available related
to library activities, search technique, data
storage technique, etc. The main purpose of
evaluation of software packages is to provide
some idea to libraries for selecting a suitable
sof tware.

3.1

Hardware and Operating
Systems

For implementing software in a library, a
suitable hardware is needed according to
operating system (0s) of the software.

Availability of suitable hardware in Indian
libraries i s a problem mostly due to
non-availability of funds or non-priority to
libraries. Thus, a library selects software either
according to hardware facility available at the
institute or the software which requires less
costly hardware. Operating system of software
is also selected according to the needs of
library, skill of manpower, availability of
hardware, etc. Hardware requirements and
operating systems for some of the software
packages are given in Table 2.

3.2

Programming Language of
software

Programming language is elso t a k n into
consideration at the tirne of deveioprnent or
procurement of software because many
facilities such as fixed field, variable field
length, variable format, search facility, etc, are
provided in the software by using suitable
programming , language. Every language or
RDBMS has some special features. Software
packages for libraries written in older, higher
programming languages, such as Cobol,
Fortran, Basic, etc. generally face problems
in their
maintenance,
upgradation,
customisation, etc., due to non-availability of
suitable manpower, not niuch interest of young
computer scientists in these languages, e!c.
Thus selection or development of software
should be made properly. Table 3 shows some
of the software packages and their language of
development.

3.3

Search Response Time and Data
Storage Techniques

Response time of the search module of a
software depends on the foliowing factors:
(a) File organisation, file access

(b) Operating system
(c) Hardware platform
(d) Rackend sofhvare used
(e) Number o i records in the database
Data storage techniques also play a vital
role in search response time. It' has been
experienced that invert file structure is faster
than B-tree structure and B-tree structure is
faster than RDBMS. Thus sottware's search

Activities
Superiority of
the software packages
depends
upon
their
capabilities and
versatility. Software providing more facilities to
automate different activities in library and
information centres may be treated most
suitable for libraries as compared to those
having limited facilities. Table 4 shows the
facilities provided in a few software packages.

3.5

Software Upgradation/
Customers' Support

Software maintenance, its customisation and
upgradation depending upon the needs of
library are very important. This service may be
good in case of software package like Libsys,
LIBRIS, etc. developed and marketed by a
private company, for their survival in the market.
However, in case of software packages
developed and marketed by Government.
agencies like DESIDOC, INSDOC, NIC, etc., i t
may not be possible to pay serious attention on
these asDects unless some urivate comDanres

4.

CONCLUSION

Till now rnany library software packages
have been developed in India as mentioned in
Table 1, to cover more and more areas of
library automation and information retrieval
functions in a single-user, multiuser, and LAN
environment. Among these software packages,
the recently developed software packages, such
as Suchika and Granthalaya are found to be
quite user-friendly, versatile and cheaper for
library automation, specialiy in case of big
libraries and ~nformdtroricentres because they
cover almost all the aspects o i Ilbraiy
automation in an integrated manner
f-lowever, Libsyps is also very powerful
because it provides tacility for articles indexing,
abstracting, SDI, etc, also in addition to library
automation but ~t may be costlier than Suchilia

and Granthalaya as it is developed by a private
company.
Sanjay is the cheapest one covering all the
aspects of library automation, but it is suitable
for small libraries only. Basisplus and Techlibplus
is also suitable for big libraries but its hardware
requirement is costlier. Now there is a need of
more powerful software packages with more
iacilities in view of many libraries networks
coming up in the country in near future.
