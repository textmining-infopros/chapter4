'Report from the Bombay Library Network
Ramani*
Abstract
This paper offers relatively unusual form of a report from the Bombay
Library Network (BONET). instead of reporting the number of
members, list of lectures given, etc. (some such details are given in
Annexure for the readers who are interested in them) This paper
presents the essence of lessons learnt by running the BONET over
last few years. BONET has been able to contribute to the activities
concerned with the absorption of new technology by practitioners in
the library and information science. Future plans including electronic
publishing, are also given.

1.

THE OLD VISION

We now have full library networks in a
number of cities, thanks to the vision of
NISSAT of the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research. At the national level, we
have the INFLIBNET, to serve the
universities. In the early days of planning
these networks in India, the vision of a
library network was that of an inter-!ibrary
service
provider,
encouraging
and
facilitating inter-library activities. It was
expected that they would help us control a
big increase in library expenditure, by
promoting the sharing of books and
periodicals. Over the years, however, it has
become clear that this objective is not
being realised to any significant degree. So,
the question arises: What should we expect
out of library networks?What are they for? I

will briefly list some of the problems
networks are facing:

e Library networking i s best done when
libraries are themselves computerised,
offering at least an online catalogue

a+ The motivation for sharing the resources
of the library of a privileged institution with
users of other libraries is altruistic; this is
often stifled by the interests of the users,
who do not wish their library give others
more than what it receives in return;
resource sharing is difficult to enforce
e Library networking alone cannot solve our
readers' problems; an increasing
expenditure on books and periodicals is
unavoidable in India; resource sharing has
its limits

+

Creating
- a library networking culture is not
a one year job; it takes timeHnd resources
to spread the culture.

So, what should we expect out of library
networks? I will argue that we should not
forget the old vision, but should be realistic
about it.

2. THE NEW VISION
It is worth reviewing the concept of a
library network, and asking what should we
get from them now? We know that what
they kill deliver as per the old vision is
limited, but are there other services that
they can and must provide? I offer my list in
the following paragraphs.

2.1

Help in Starting Up

The first step i s always the big step. The
libraries in lndia are getting used to e-mail,
with a few exceptions of libraries which
have been using e-mail for many years now.
The biggest impact will be in making e-mail
routinely available to every library, and in
encouraging its use for inter-library
activities. I believe that every Indian library
network, at this stage, should focus on this
responsibility and ensure that all its
members become regular users of e-mail.

2.2

Information Retrieval

Very few of our libraries have
bibliographic databases for
enabling
researchers to identify documents of
interest. CD-ROMs are making these
databases more easily accessible. However,
there will always be ten libraries without
good bibliographic databases for every one
that has them. The cost of CD-ROM
equipment is not the central issue, it i s the
cost of the subscriptions.
To the extent that the libraries can share
bibliographic databases, they can achieve a
lot. Unlike sharing of books and bound
volumes, here you can give without
denying the information to yourself. You are
giving access, not giving away the database!
42

2.3

Getting Reprints over the
Network

Scholars and researchers will never be
satisfied with the few hundred journals that
each big library in lndia subscribes to. The
number of active periodicals exceeds
50,000 easily. So, a very common need of
the library user is to get a photocopy of a
paper he knows about, but cannot lay his
hands on. The cost of a copy for scholarly
use is a few hundred rupees, but the cost of
getting it from abroad over fax could be Rs.
2,000! Getting it by airmail will take too
long. In any case the paperwork required
for getting such a copy of a reprint is quite
high. A library network can arrange to get
these over the network. It can set up
appropriate arrangements with ovt-rseas
suppliers as well as with sister libraries in
India. Specialised software i s now available
for this purpose. The paper is usually
photocopied, and then scanned. This
creates a computer data file, which is sent
over e-mail, to be reconverted into a printed
image at the other end, and printed on a
laser printer. Since e-mail transmission i s
usually inexpensive, the operation becomes
eminently worthwhile. This is an example of
resource-sharing that fits in very we!l with
the old model of a library n e ~ o r k .

2.4

Information and Know-how

The world is getting to be quite complex.
As soon as you wish to share database, you
run into questions of intellectual property
rights (IPR). The supplier of the database
may not allow you to share them without
additional payment. Even if you wish to give
away photocopies of articles, you will need
to know the IPR issues involved. While
budgets have been, and will continue to be,
a problem for libraries, technological
know-how often turns out to be a more
serious constraint. Whether it is about IPR
issues, purchase issues, or computerisation

Ramani - Report from the Bombay Library Network

issues, a united community of librarians and
others interested in sharing information and
know-how, is better equipped to cope with
them than individual libraries. A library
network can, and must, offer information,
know-how, consultation and training related
to technology. A library network should
offer information to its members on all
network resources. Very often, this has to
be done pro-actively through a series of
periodic meetings. Ultimately, the user
community should be able to learn about
the new media, about local resources and
network resources. The library network
should train the staff of member libraries
well enough that they, in turn, train their
users.

library is no more limited to the old media
than any othei part of a university. The
library should provide leadership for the
exploitation of the new media. The library
network plays a very important role here.
By making the new facilities available, by
encouraging member libraries to adopt the
new media, the networks can play a
catalytic role. I take up a few special forms
of electronic publication, and deal with
them individually in the few following
paragraphs.

2.7

Electronic Newsletters

The flow of information in this field has
to be increasingly international. The efforts
required, and the costs involved, in
organising seminars and workshops are
substantial. A library networking group can
play a catalytic role in this, bringing
together members frequently for valuable
updates.

Have you heard of an Indian electronic
newsletter that i s produced in the country
and distributed widely here? I have not! We
need them. Library networks should create
them and support them, in addition to
publicising
international
newsletters
available in electronic form. The skills
needed to activate contributors, edit the
contributions, disseminate the information,
and control the discussion, are all valuable.
These are not going to be the monopoly of
library staff, but they will surely have their
share of all this.

2.5

Seminars and Workshops

Network P u b l i c a t i ~ n

The network i s not merely a tool for
making better use of Information resources
in a classical form. The network has
become a big source of information itself.
Electronic archival of technical reports,
reprints and dissertations has become
common. More visibility is gained for a
laboratory through a welldone home page
on the world-wide-web than through an
expensive annual report. More preprints are
shared by e-mail than by post. Increasingly,
more time is spent reading "news groups"
on the network than in the library!
The
question is:
Is information
dissemination through these new media the
concern of the library, or of the computer
centre, or of others? I would argue that the

Electronic Archives

Almost every paper being published
today is prepared by the author on a
computer, and almost every dissertation.
We still allow every author to throw these
files away at the end, and keep only the
paper copy! How can we do this? By
creating an electronic archive for each
community of library users, perhaps at the
library level, or perhaps at the level of a
library network, we can avoid this wastage.
A document preserved in the digital form
can be transmitted by e-mail at almost no
cost and very rapidly. It can also be
preserved forever at low cost. Such new
ideas can be spread and exploited only with
the help of library networks. Many archives
offer world-wide access through the file

transfer protocol (ftp) to anonymous users.
Running such an ftp site and stocking it
with information of local relevance is an
important responsibility. The library network
should also carry out this responsibility.

2.9

The World-Wide-Web

This
relatively
new
medium
of
multimedia
communication
is
very
promising. Offering access to remote
collections of text, sound and visuals over
computer
networks,
the
web
has
revolutionised information dissemination. I
would expect every library network to run
its own web server and to instruct the staff
of its member libraries in the art of creating
and maintaining web pages and/or web
servers.

3. CONCLUSION
What is a library network? It is not a
mere tool for facilitating resource sharing! It
has to be an organisation for information

and know-how sharing. It has to be a
demonstration site and training centre for
new communication media and new
technology. It has to offer consultancy and
assistance. It has to be a meeting place and
a coordination centre. It has to be a
repository for an electronic archive and for
other network resources. We can now talk
of second generation library networks. They
can meet the new needs of the libraries and
communities of library users.

4. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
