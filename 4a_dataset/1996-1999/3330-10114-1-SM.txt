Collection Development in NISTADS Library
Anita Bali*

Abstract
This paper describes the collection development program in National
lnstitute of Science, Technology and Development Studies (NISTADS) library.
The library had good financial support but it could not meet all the
requirement of its user community due to the exponential growth of
literature, rising price of books and periodicals and shortage of space. An
appropriate collection development plan was developed by resource sharing
with outside libraries and making use of available information technology.

INTRODUCTION

Special libraries these days, face specific
challenges owing to exponential growth in
publishing, increasing cost of publications,
increasing user demands, budget constraints,
space shortages, etc. In view of these factors
collection development policy for the selection
and acquisition of literature becomes very
important besides efficient techniques of
storage and retrieval, maintenance (including,
care and repair of publications, occasional
weeding
out
programs),
inter-library
cooperation, and reprographic services. Finance
is the most important deciding factor in the
selection of literature. No library is likely to have
funds to buy everything published or even to
buy all the most worthwhile publications. Hence
the greatest care is to be exercised in spending
the funds available for acquisition of literature.
The principal library collection for most
scientific and technical libraries are of books
including society publications, periodicals,
standards, , patents, reprints, trade literature,
maps, translations, microfilms, etc.

NISTADS AND ITS LIBRARY

The Council of Scientific and Industrial
Research (CSIR), realising the need for well
thought out science policy inputs into the
national planning process, constituted in 1974
the Centre for the Study of Science, Technology
and Development (CSSTD). This centre was
subsequently given the status of an autonomous
institute of CSIR and renamed as the National
lnstitute of
Science,
Technology
and
Development Studies (NISTADS) in 1981. In
1982,
the
Centre
for
Management
Development (CMD), which was till then
working as a part of CSlR Headquarters, was
also merged with NISTADS. Science and
Technology (S&T) is being increasingly
recognised as instrument of change and for
achieving a set of socio-economic and political
objectives. In this context, several crucial
problems and policy issues of S&T and its
interface with the society need to be analysed.
The understanding of these problems requires
long-term perspective and multidisciplinary
approach involving analytical tools and
techniques on the one hand and a broad
spectrum of economic, social, historical and
15

cultural dimensions of S&T on the other. The
Institute's research programs thus cover various
facets of the interactive processes of the science
technology society development nexus-broadly
called Science and Technology Studies (STS).
The main objectives of NISTADS are:
(a)

To carry out researchin the areas of science,
technology and society (STS).

(b) To provide consultancy services and
undertake sponsored research and
commissioned studies for international and
national agencies, central and local
government bodies, industries and other
organisations concerned with policy
formulation, planning and management of
science and technology.
(c)

To provide training to scholars and
functionaries from lndia
and other
developing countries in the areas of
Institute's specialisation.

(d) To undertake cooperative research projects
and provide research opportunities to
scholars through various schemes.
(e)

To add to general fund of knowledge in STS
through
publications,
seminars,
conferences, lectures, etc.

(fJ

Information dissemination in its areas of
specialisation.

Being a multidisciplinary organisation the
institute considered it essential to build up a
viable information system to meet the
information needs of researchers both in lndia
and other devehping countries. Therefore, at
the time of inception, the CSSTD established an
information unit which formed the campus of
NlSTADS library since 1980.
The basic collection of any special library
consists of reference books like encyclopaedias,
dictionaries,
handbooks,
directories,
etc.-(documents
vital to the subject of
specialisation of the library) scholarly journals
and reports. NISTADS library which may be
referred as a socio-scientific library and is
different from other S&T libraries in some
respects. For instance in a S&T library, books,
journals and reports on a specific discipline are
required but since NISTADS works in
16

multidisciplinary/
interdisciplinary research
activities, the collection i s built around the
following major themes:
Technological and social change,
S&T indicators and scientometrics,
Resource planning and utilisation for regional
development,
Studies for CSIR,
Mathematical modelling for science and
technology studies,
Sociology of science,
lnformation systems and S&T archival
resources,
History and philosophy of science, and
Public attitude towards understanding of
science.
The present budget of the library is Rs. 24
lakhs, and i s managed by staff of six persons
consisting of a librarian and five professional
staff.
Dr SR Ranganathan's, famous fifth law of
library science 'library is a growing organism',
has proved true at NISTADS. The library started
with a small collection of books transferred from
CSIR headquarter's library and in the initial
years, sustained on gifts and exchange of
documents. From the year 1982, it started
getting regular btidget. The budget of NISTADS
library has been increasing every year and
increase in the budget has resulted in the
growth of collection of books, journals, reports,
etc.
There has also been steady increase in the
staff strength of the institute. Annual increase in
the budget and the corresponding development
in the collection of document, etc., has been
shown in Table 1 and the annual increase in the
scientific/technica\ personnel of the institute is
shown in Table 2.

(d) Through books exhibitions within the
institute; books displayed in the lnstitute by
vendors at regular intervals.
(e) Through book fairs.

Books are selected by individual scientists
and their selections are put up before the library
cornmiaee consisting of members from different
research groups. The library committee takes
into consideration the subject content of the
books and the budget. After discussion among
the members, selections get finalised. The
committee recommends the purchase of
selected books to the Director. The Director too
gives a closer look to the list and approves the
relevant documents. The final list of the books
approved is received back by the library. All
efforts are made to avoid purchase of duplicate
copy of the books by checking the approved list
with library catalogue. In this process of three
tier filtering, the library is able to acquire only
the most relevant books.

Periodicals are vital to the work of a research
organisation, and these require judicious
selection. Periodicals are more important than
books for researchers and specialists. As
research activities are worldwide and are
increasing day by day, more and more
periodicals are being published from all over the
world with a view to disseminate the growing
research information. According to an estimate,
about one lakh periodicals are being published
all over the world. (Statistical yearbook, Unesco,
1988) Selection of the most useful periodicals
becomes extremely difficult because of huge
number of titles covering the area of ones
interest and high specialisation of individual
journal.
Moreover journal selection or
acquisition is not a one time decision. To utilise
the periodicals resources, a library has to have
complete run of back volumes or at least five
years' consecutive collection. Because of this
special nature of periodicals, the financial
burden spans through more than one year. The
procedure followed in NISTADS library and the
important considerations for acquiring a
periodical are:
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Techno/, 1997,17(2)

IThe present and future research programs to
be supported by the institute.
The relative significance of particular journals
in a subject area.
The journals enjoying special patronage or
preferences by the local clientele.
Periodicals are acquired by subscription, gift,
exchange or through institutional membership.
However, majority of them are acquired
through subscription. At present the library
subscribes to 287 periodicals in different
subdisciplines of STS studies, of which about
150 are core journals.
To provide further access to periodical
literature, over and above the subscribed titles,
library also subscribes to indexing and
abstracting services. Indexing and abstracting
services are the most important bibliographical
tools for controlling periodical literature. A few
indexing/abstracting services subscribed at
NISTADS library are:

Cumnt Contents (CC) : CC contain
contents pages of journals. It gives access to the
table of contents of the latest journal issues
published and saves valuable time spent in
locating information vital to research needs. CC
covers about 1100 top journals and also books
published. It is published every weekjfortnight
in seven sections out of which NISTADS library
subscribes to two sections-Arts & Humanities,
Social and Behavioural Sciences. The other
important feature of the CC is its title word
index, author index and address directory and
publisher address directory. These features help
in locating relevant articles and getting the copy
either by sending request to authors or ordering
the copy of the issue to publisher or getting
through lnstitute for Scientific Information or
any document delivering agencies.
Guide to Indian.Periodical Literature :It i s
an alphabetical subject author index to articles
in the social sciences and humanities appearing
in lndian periodicals. It i s an extremely useful
service especially because of the regularity of its
publication program. It is a quarterly service
with annual cumulation.
lndex India : lndex India, a quarterly
documentation list of lndia on material in

English-combining in one sequence Indian
newspaper index, lndex to Indian Periodicals,
lndex to foreign periodicals, lndex to composite
publications, lndex to the biographical profiles,
lndex to book reviews, Index to theses and
dissertations cumulated annually.

ISIS :This is a quarterly periodical in the area
of History of Science. The special feature of this
journal is extensive book reviews in each issue
and annual current biblography. This serves as
important book selection tool as well an index
for a specialised library like NISTADS.
Current Literature on Science of Science
(CLOSS) :A monthly journal published by the
NISTADS, New Delhi. It reports contributions
and development in the field of science and
technology studies. It aims at an international
readership ranging from scholars, scientists and
technologists to policy makers, and planners.
The journal disseminates current information in
the form of abstracts, book reviews, digest,
news and notes. A feature of the journal is the
special attention given to the concerns of
developing countries.

2.2.3 Technical Reports
Next to books and periodicals, the report
literature i s an important primary source of
information particujarly for a sociescientific
library.
This new medium for communication of
information came into being during the World
War II due to scarcity of paper, restrictions in
distribution, and delay in bringing out
periodicals. Reports not only solved the
problems then, but proved quite useful even
after the War. Reports may be either technical,
(originating from R&D activity) or non-technical
(reports issued from governmental or Non
governmental agencies). The availability of large
number of reports and their important,
demands that care be taken to acquire, only
those reports which are directly relevant to the
research work of the organisation.
In NISTADS library, reports are acquired
directly from the issuing agency. However,
agents have been appointed by certain foreign
agencies such as the National Technical
Information Service (NTIS) and Oxford Books
20

and Stationary Company for distribution of
reports in India. Priced reports are generally
purchased and reports are also acquired on
exchange basis, institutional membership,
comp\imenbry or as depository. Secondary
publications keep abreast of the latest reports
published in different subdisciplines and are
used for report selection.
Technical reports are accessioned in the
same way as are books. These are generally
arranged on the shelf by corporate author and
under each organisation according to serial
number of the report member assigned by the
issuing ageney. A detailed catalogue by
corporate authors, personal authors, title report
number and subject is maintained for reference
purposes. At NISTADS, report collection is
housed separately.

Networks

It i s said that now we are living in a 'global
village', due to the impact of information
technology. A similar situation is faced in the
modern libraries and here we have 'libraries
without walls'. At NISTADS library, this is
achieved by participating in Delhi Library
Network, Scientific & Industrial Research
Network and also by accessing Internet.
Network in its broadest sense means the
electronic
information
access
among
interconnected nodes. When applied to library
activity, it means anything from the
organisational resource sharing agreements
established among nearby libraries to
automated networks such as t h operated by
bibliographic utilities. In one sense, networks
existed even before the advent to information
technology in the form of inter-library
agreements (arrangements). But the modern
technology brought efficiency into these
arrangements. For example, from any one
library which is member of the DELNET, one
can access the catalogue of other member
libraries. Other facility offered by DELNET is
online list of currently subscribed periodicals in
its member libraries. Similarly, SIRNET offers a
union catalogue of 800 libraries periodical
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technd, 1997,17 (2)

,holdings and also provides journal content page
service on subscription basis. In other words,
the network acts as complementary to NISTADS
library and takes care of peripheral subject area
interests. Though NISTADS has Internet
connectivity, the library at present i s not in a
position to exploit it for meeting Its information
demands.

Compact
Disk-Read
Only
Memory
(CD-ROM) is an electronic format for storing
information on a small laser disk. CD-ROM
requires the interfacing of a CD-ROM player
and a micmcomputer. The CD-ROMs generally
contain huge volume of numeric, bibliographic
or textual information. By using keywords,
descriptors or formulating search strategy one
can quickly locate the rewired information.
The electronic media of storage of
information has revolutionised the role of
library-which was once the storehouse of
knowledge in the society. It is now possible for
individuals to own an encyclopaedia or huge
dictionary. However, still users have to depend
on libraries for expensive databases which are
either available on-line or on CD-ROM.
At .NISTADS, the library has CDROM of
Company lnformation called Investment
Decision Support System (IDSS). This provides
current information about 2000 companies
which are registered with Bombay stock
exchange. Apart from financial information this
CDdatabase c w e n annual reports, chairman's
speeches and newspaper dippings relating to
companies.

23 year history. The reports span the science
and technology-related subjects covered by
OTA over the year-including defence, space,
energy, environment, education, transportation,
health, agriculture, tekcammunications and
advanced materials. The collection can be an
important research tool for science and
technology policy analysts and decision makers
for many years to come. This CD-ROM
cdection contains over 100,000 pages of full
text and graphics, including all OTA report as
well as information about the agency's
organlsational structure and history.

Efforts are being made to colka
encyclopaedias,
such as
Encyclopaedia
Britannia on CD as well as Microsoft Bookshelf
(covering dictionary, thesaurus, almanac,
encyclopaedia, attas, etc.).
Since CD-ROM technology helps in relieving
libraries from the problem of storage space.
NISTADS library is considering procurement of
journals/back volumes on CD. The library has
identified following services which provide
social science periodicak fulktext on CD for
subscription in coming years.

Social Science Inder/Fulf Text an disk
(UMIJ:This provides information in all areas of
social sciences with abstracts and indexing,
from 400 titles covered in the HW Wilson
company's Social Sciences Index and full

full text coverage provided from 1989. It is
updated monthly.

CONCLUSION

Libraries today face a challenging task of
meeting unlimited information demands of
their users with limited financial resources. The
demands of user are justified because of
information explosion in every subject area. It is
the balancing act of selective inhouse collection
development and use of information technology
which can quench the thirst of research
community. A step towards this has been taken
at NISTADS library.
