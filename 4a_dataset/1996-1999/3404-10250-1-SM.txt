LEGAL DATABASES tN INDIA

The dwebpment of law libraries and hw
information centres in India has beeFl r a h r
slow. Law libraries in India can be classified into
three categories:
(ij Libraries as part of academic institutions like
law collegesy law faculties and bw
departments in the Universities, with a total
number of at present 349;

(ii)Law libraries as part d judicial infrastructure
such as Supreme Court High Courts, Lower
Courts and Bar Associations; and
(iii) Legislativelibraries as a part of Parliamentand
State Legislative Assemblies.

3.1

Court Libraries

Court libraries serve the Judges who sit in
courts and lawyers who appear before them.
These Court libraries vary considerably in their
collection and services. Many subordinate
courts, in fact have no libraries. This was well
illustrated by Justice PB Sawant in a decision of
the Supreme Court:
me reasons which prompted this court to
direct the grant of residence-cumlibrary
allowance to every judidal officer was that it
was found that there was no provision br a
judges' library in most of the Courts of the
subordinate judicial officers. As a result t h q
have either to depend upon the library
maintained by the Bar, if any, or to go without
the assistance of the books. At many places,
particularly, at the Talult/Tehsil level, there is not
even an adequate Bar library available. It is
difficult to understand the attitude of the State
Governments towards the prwisions of the
facility of law books and journals to the judges
when the judges whose duty consists of
interpreting the law and applying it to the facts
before them. It is like asking the artisans to work
without tfwir tools. The law h k s not tO speak
of the 0th- books are the essential tools of the
judges. The minimum that is expected of the
State is to provide wery court with the
DES/m

dhd T-,

199&1C(4)

u p U t e texts of commentaries on the relevant
statuksandlawpWnalswhiEhrep~tt~
of the High Courtr and the Supreme Court for
the exdusive use of the judges. The
Gavwnments consistentty Failed to provide this
primary facility to the cwrtslrs.

3.1.1 High Court Libcaries
The oldest High Court libraries are located at
Cakutta, Bombay and Madras. These libraries
h m g o d colkUons of legal reports and legal
commentaries. The eighteen High Courts in
country do have workable library collections
although no survey has ever been made of
these libraries It mn be said that collection of
these libraries, are just enough to meet the local
needs of a particular High Court. Shwtage of
finance and lack of professionally trained
librarians has resulted in the slow development
of High Court libraries.

3.1.2 Bar Associations' Libraries
Alongwith Judgerylibraries, Bar Association
of all the High Courts and Supreme Court have
their own libraries for lawyers. A peculiar aspect
of these lbraries is hat they are headed by
some clerks and peons who have learnt their
jobs by doing it and without any training.
Services to clientele is the most negligible
aspect in all the cases.

3.2 Supreme Court fudges' Library
The Supreme Court Judges' Library was
established in 1938. It has a collection of about
2,50,000 kgat documents, which includes
books, monographs, commission reports,
government publications, centre and state
legislation and other tegislatiw material. it
subschs to about 300 Indian and foreign
reporting and academic journals and has a staff
strength of 70 including 16 professional
librarians. The clientele of the library are
Hon8bk judges, Senior Advocates, Court
Managers and law researcherr ot d i f h t
universities doing academic research.
Supreme Court Judges' Library is a grid of
libraries. In addition to Central taw Library, it
ako maintains wmkabh collection in f 1 Bench
Libraries and 26 residential libraries of Hon'ble
judges. Supreme Court judges' Library is
essentially a reference and research department

Inhation
Comgutcrisltion w a s in Supreme Cawt
started in 1992. Supieme Cwrt bdges' Libnry
has introduced nmv techmbgy in a p h a d
manner with t h r e distinct pmjects under hs
planned programme:
(i) Case Indexing:
(ii) Cwrent Contentc (Academic Articles);
(iii) Legirblion.

The ldges' Library identified the data&
of about 25.000 decided cases from 1950
onwards and approximately I500 cases
npor#abIe/mn r e p t a b l e annuah. Hence, the
judpnen$/or&rs reported in Off~ialReport
i.e., Supwrne Court Reports and o t k r

3.2,3 SUPUS: Retrieval System
An irnpwtult featurn of the SUPLIS is tnc
retrieval mechanism developed on tne basis of
rnfrwmaih seeking need of users. This system
has k e n created on the b ~ s i sof queries and

alkws the ustr to sckci t f n mined wtions of

desk4 casejcases for having full details of the
judgements. For this, one can enter the case
numhr to get ihe full detail in a welt daigned
screen.

3.2.4 SUPLIS: Data Conhnls
SUPtlS contains the fdlowing inbrnation
a b w t the casts and judgements deliwred by
the w
x Cwrt. It facilitates retrieal d
infcwrnation in conderabk deiail, satisfying the
rids of users who haw differerrt

{ w i i j k l j d Headings
(ix) Famous name of the Judgements/Carcs and

(x) Words/P hrases/ Maxims.
As explained above, the system provides a

very powerful retriwal mechanism. A decided
case can be accessed through any of the above
fields/sub fields, and certain sub menus are
immensely helpful in delimiting the search to
the specific requirement of the user. Some of
the fields s u h as citation, subject heading,
famous name of the judgements and
words/phrases/maxims satisfies the different
approach to information. In a casefiudgernents,
'Equivalent Citation' field is a popular reference
tool for lawyers. SUPLIS indexes four more
journals in addition to Supreme Court Reports
as enumerated under the field 'Citation'. These
citations enable the lawyers to retrieve more
varied and complete information about the
cases from journals which are selective in their
reporting of cases. Another field 'Petition
Number' is useful for the judicial sections of the
court where file location is a day to day
requirement and files are arranged according to
numbers. The option 'Subject Headings' helps
in retrieving the text through words which
appear in the headnotes. While selecting this
option, the facility of Boolean search is provided
in SUPLIS. Headnotes are prepared by subject
experts and they contain legal +errns used in
decided cases.
Supreme Court Judges' Library and NIC are
jointly refining, improving and updating the
SUPLIS and its software for better functioning
and retrieval. For the case history, status and
current information concerning the validity of
the decided cases, library has added new
features of 'Citator of Cases'. The library is also
in the process of adding to the database
Appeal/Review/Over-rule/History and Citation
of High Court judgements. The Supreme Court
has taken an initiative in launching a challenging
project of full text of Supreme Court's decided
cases, which would be perhaps a pioneer step
in legal information and it would also shape the
future of the courts functioning in this part of
the World.

3.2.5 IUDIS (JudgementInformation
System)
On 8th March 1995, the then Hon'ble Chief
Justiceof India inaugurated the release of JUDlS
26

connecting all the 18 Htgh Courts through
satellite based computer communication
network. jUDlS prwides free-text based retrievai
system of the decided cases from 1950
onwards. It is a comprehenshe online Case Law
Library. It helps to find relevant precedent on
any subject that is judicially considered by the
Supreme Court. It has complete choice of
retrieval fields available in SUPLIS with
additional free choice to choose your own set
of typical words which you feel are part of the
text of the case. JUDtS can be accessed from
any of the 750 nodes of the NICNET across the
country and High Courts computer cell.
NIC has announced the release of JUDlS
CD-ROM for the benefit of legal fraternity of
Judges, lawyers, and legal researchers. It is a
user-friendly supplement to the online jUD1S
developed by the NIC and Supreme Court. It
contains all reportable cases published in official
report of the court namely; Supreme Court
Reports from t 950 onwards.

JUDIS-CD-ROM is available in two versions:
Unix and Windows. The unix needs the
institutions having Unix based servers for
providing multiuser access. Windows version,
which has Graphic User Interface, serves the
needs of individual users who have window
based system. JUDIS-CD-ROM proyides
retrieval through various field : Title, Judge,
Time, Act and Free Text. Search information can
be entered in the Query by Example (QBE)
screen. Boolean operator efficiently retrieve the
required case with (And, Or, Not) indicators.
Users can type commands instead of filling
in a QBE screen; a command query window is
provided with easy to learn commands. One
can retrieve through subject heading (e.g.,
Defamation), phrase and maxim (e.g., Res
judicata with period restriction of search years
such as 1995-1997; Boolean (i.e., And, Or, Not)
operation (e.g., Librarian and Parity). After
receiving the appropriate response to a query
one can see the records of the full text with
print-out facilities.

3.26 Computerisation of Library
Operations
Supreme Court judges' Library is also using
new technology in its routine functioning.
