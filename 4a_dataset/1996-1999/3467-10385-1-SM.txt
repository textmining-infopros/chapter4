(ENVIS). It describes the responsibilities and activities of ENVlS Focal Point
and Centres. The author concludes with the futuristic views of ENVIS.

1.

INTRODUCTION

lnformation is a resource, which together
with physical, economical, technical and human
resources is a must for national development.
Sustainable development, which has evolved as
the goal for human welfare in recent times,. is
rooted in the availability of right information to
the right person at the right place and at the
right time. The need for information arises at aH
levels, from that of senior decision-makers, at
the national and international levels to the grass
roots and individual levels.
Environmentally sound decisions, which are
a must for achieving sustainable development,
are not possible in an information vacuum.
Environmental information is, therefore, of vital
importance. Realising the importance of
environmental information, an Environmental
lnformation System (ENVIS) was established by
the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 1982
to provide. information to decision-makers,
policy-planners, scientists, etc., all over the
country. Disiemination of information to the
users is the most vital component in the whole
system for the users' satisfaction.
ENVIS is a* decentralised network
information system consisting of a Focal Point in
the Ministry for cwrdinating the activities of a
DEsfooCBulletin of Inf Technd, 1999,19(2)

chain of 24 subject specific centres (known as
ENVIS Centres) located in various prestigious
institutions/organisations all over the country.
The list of existing ENVlS centres alongwith the
subjects allotted to them is given in Annexure-I.

ENVIS AS INFOTERRA
NATIONAL FOCAL POINT

Based on the functions of the ENVIS, it has
been designated as a National Focal Point
(NFP) and a Regional Service Centre (RSC) of
INFOTERRA of UNEP for the South Asia
sub-region, a global environmental information
network which stimulate and support exchange
of information within and between the nations.
Almost all membercountries of United Nations
are partners of this network.
The following are the responsibilities of the
ENVIS as a National Focal Point and Regional
Service Centre of INFOTERRA Network:

(NISSAT), Biotechnology Information System
(BTIS) and several other similar networks for
exchany of environmental information as well
as to avoid duplication of efforts in the
concerned fields. ENVIS also makes use of large
number of computerised databases developed
by scientific institutions all over the country. In
order to search the various databases both
nationally and internationally, ENVlS has
created a website which could be browsed at
http ://~.nic.in/envfm/envis.

ENVIS AS AN IMPLEMENTING
AGENCY FOR SDNP

ENVIS Focal Point in the Ministry has been
identified as an implementing agency for
UNDP's Sustainable Development Networking
Programme (SDNP). The SDNP has been
DfiIDOC 8ulktin of Inf Techml, 1999,19(2)

initiated with financial support from United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and
International Development Research Centre
(IDRC), Canada for a period of three years.
The goal of the programme is to promote
the process of sustainable development through
organised accessibility to and exchange of
information among all concerned parties viz.
academic and research institutions, NGOs,
government
bodies
and
business
establishments. To achieve this goal, the
following objectives have been set:
(a) Establish and operate a distributed
clearinghouse: to answer and channel
queries related to sustainable development.
(b) Organise an SONP Association: this
Association will be open to individuals and
institutions concerned with exchange of
information on sustainable development.
The programme is in its initial phase of
implementation. The SDNP Secretariat has
been set up in the Ministry and the work for
operationalising SDNP is going on. During its
initial phase of implementation, the SDNP plans
to undertake the following activities:
0 Recruitment of staff for the secretariat
0 Set up SDNP home page on world wide web

and develop SDNP web site around subject
areas related with sustainable development

o

Maintain directory of information providers

0 Develop and maintain databases for

Q

providing easy access to information on
sustainable development
~~~t
dircussion groups on specific
subject areas.
9

In addition to these, necessary systems such
as inventory of information providers;
dimination of information (both manual and
automated); collection, storage and retrieval of
information in useable format; record of
queries, etc., will alsobe evolved.

The ENVlS in the Ministry has been
identified as host of SDNP. The ENVlS Focal
Point in the Ministry networks with twlenty-four
ENVlS centres located in various parts of the
country. These centres have been collecting,
analysing and disseminating information on
their specialised subject areas related with
environment

Both ENVlS and SDNP share a common
goal of dissemination of information on a
number of subject areas. The ENVlS was
originally envisaged as an inforrnation system in
Environmental Sciences and Engineerins while
SDNP encompasses a broader range of subject
area as sustainable human development. In the
initial creation phase, the SDNP will rely heavily
on the ENVlS network being co-ordinated by
the ENVlS focal point in the Ministry. Both
ENVIS and SDNP have started working together
and the ENVlS Focal Point is providing all the
required support
to the SDNP for
operationalisingthe Programme in the country.
The SDNP aims to identify nodes on various
subject areas and help them disseminate
information to users through print and
electronic media. Some of these nodes will be
identified from existing ENVlS centres.
Information
colection.
analysis
and
dissemination already being done by the ENVlS
centres will prove to be quite useful in carrying
the work further. The SDNP will help these
selected nodes develop their web site, host
their m b site on SDNP web server, help them
develop (electronic) databases and mount them
on the web for easy searching, provide
necessary training to selected personnel for
developing and updating web pages and
uploading them on their respective web sites.
Information Technology (IT) has a greater role

to play in this networking programme. The
SDNP web site will become a starting point for
any user searching information on sustainable
development.
The various divisions of ENVlS as envisaged
earlier for the ENVlS focal point are no longer
in existence or they have been either merged
with other divisions of the Ministry or not at all
operational at this point of time.
It is important to note that both ENVlS and
SDNP have to work together to aavoid any
duplication of efforts and set up a common
goal which can be met by joint efforts of the
E M l S Focal Point in the Ministry and the SDNP
Secretariat.

FUTURISTIC VIEW OF ENVIS

AH ENVlS centres set up under the ENVlS
scheme could be browsed at the URL
htg//~.nic.i~/envfor/kmbfor accessing
existing information in the subject area
concerned. tn order to provide an online
information, almost all the ENVlS Centres are
being networked with the Focal Point and
vice-versa. It is also proposed that a wide area
network (WAN) would be installed at ENVlS not
only to link with Internet but also to liaison with
various other international databases in the field
of environment and its associated areas for easy
and quick accession to the desired information.
It is also proposed to develop CDs for easy
exchange of information to its several network
partners and to other national information
systems. In order to familiarise with the modern
information technologies it is also proposed to
promote, support and assist educational and
professional training programmes under the
scheme to enhance environmental information
processing and utilisation capabilities and to
promote exchange of information amongst
developing countries during the Ninth Plan
period. Besides, all ENVlS network partners
would be substantially supported not only to
develop its homepage but also to set up a
website of their own for easy and quick
accession of relevant information by all
concerned.
