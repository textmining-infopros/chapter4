Notable Features of MALIBNET
R Raghavan* and Jayasri Raghavan**
ABSTRACT
This paper gives a detailed account of the objectives, structure,
products, services of MALIBNET, its linkages with INSDOC and the
users of the Network. MALIBNET is claimed to be a model network
which has become operational in a short span of four months after it
is registered as a society and that too without government support
except that of INSDOC.

The need for interconnecting libraries in
Madras was visualised by Indian National
Scientific Documentation Centre (IP4SDOC)
in 1991. The centre undertook a feasibility
study, which was partially funded by
NISSAT. The study was completed in March
i 992. N o major funding was available from
government sources for realising the
network. However, the Heads of some
major academic and research institutions,
universities and industries in and around
Madras and many others extended
over~vhelmingsupport to the concept of
hlAL1BNET-the
synonym standing for
Madras Library Network.
Based on this support, and their
cooperation, MALIBNET was registered as a
society in February 1993 and the Network
became operational in June 1993.

INSDOC, the CSlR laboratory engaged
in the field of information management and
services, is the executing agency for the
MALIBNET
project.
Through
an
Memorandum of Understanding, INSDOC
has been assigned the responsibility of
setting up the network, developing
information products and offering basic
information services on MALIBNET.

2. OBJECTIVES
A Library Network i s formally defined as
"a set of inter-related information systems
associated with communicatior; facilities
which adhere to more or less formal
agreements and institutional agreements, in
order to jointly implement in for ma ti or^
handling operations, with a view to pooling
the resources and serving the users better".
MALIBNET has been established with
the following objectives:
a Bring about cooperative w o r k i ~ g
,~rnor-igst
the libraries and information ceritrcls in ?he
city of Madras in particular, and in the state
of Tamil Nadu in general;
47

Raghavan & Raghavan - Notable Features of MALIBNET

te Evolve

n e t w o r k o f libraries and
information centres in and around Madras
region initially, and in other parts of the
state later;

te Facilitate sharing of resources among the

libraries and information centres and
promote information dissemination;
te Establish appropriate linkages with other

regional, national and international
libraries, information and documentation
centres and networks of such libraries and
centres;
a Organise
conferences,
lectures,
workshops and seminars in the fields of
interest.

3. NEED FOR RESOURCE
SHARING
Cooperation is a vital social activity
characterising the human civilisation. The
aim of any cooperative endeavour is to
achieve what the members of the group
cannot achieve individually. Resource
sharing amongst
libraries aims at
extending access to ail the resources and
services of the member libraries to a
wider category of users in the region. The
libraries would then cease to function as
isolated units.
The obvious advantages of resource
sharing among the geographically adjacent
libraries are many, they are:

e avoiding unnecessary duplication of
information materials and efforts

e possibility of developing specialised
activities, specifically concentrating on
some particular functions, and

e maximum accessibility to information
without losing the individuality of libraries.
48

3.1

Resource Libraries

Madras has about 60 important libraries
besides information centres like INSDOC.
About 15 of these libraries have holdings of
1,00,000
documents. A
total
over
investment 'of about ten crores is being
made on acquisitions every vear. An
estimate shows that nearly 40 percent of
the information acquired is redundant.
Table-l brings out the level of redundancy in
current journals being subscribed in a set of
50 libraries in Madras. With the libraries
networked
and
resource
sharing
implemented, each user on the network
can access to a very vast amount of
literature and redundancy can be brought
down significantly, diverting the investment
saved
to
other
productive
and
developmental activities.

3.2

Management

MALIBNET is governed by a Governing
Board comprising of President, Vice
President, Executive Director, Secretary,
Treasurer and members. The Society has
several eminent personalities as rnembers
on the Governing Board. Currently, Dr SB
Sundaresan, Member of the Sfate Planning
Commission, Tamil Nadu is the ;;resider>t,
Dr M Anandakrishnan, Vice Chancellor,
Anna Ufiiversity, Madras i s the Vice
President, Prof T Viswanathan, Director,
INSDOC, New Delhi is the Executive
Director and other members are drawn
from the Heads of Institutions such as
Indian Institute of Technology, Madras,
Central
Leather
Research
Institute,
University of Madras, Tamilnadu Veterinary
& Animal Sciences University, Institute of
Mathematical Sciences, lndira Gandhi
Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam
and distinguished scientists such as Dr MS
Swaminathan Annexure. The Governing
Board meets once in four months to review
the activities of MALIBNO.

4. NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
MALIBNET became operational from
june 1993, in less than six months from the
date o f its inception. It has a central
network service centre (NSC) installed at
INSDOC Regional Centre, CSlR Complex,
Madras. All the member institutions are
linked with the MALIBNET host system
through telephone links. The network
structure of MALIBNET is shown in Fig 1. A
library or information centre may be directly
connected to NSC through telephone lines
or may be clustered and connected through
X.25 data communication interfaces. w i t h i n
an institution, a library may be connected
on local area network (LAN) to facilitate the
L A N users to access MALIBNET.

5. DATABASES
At present four databases are being
supported on MALIBNET from its own
resources. In addition, a number of
databases from INSDOC are also made
available on MALIBNET.

7. CONCLUSION
MALIBNET has reached to operational
stage from the concept stage in a short
span of time. Four factors have contributed
to this: An overwhelming institutional
support at Madras; the specialised services
of INSDOC made available through a
strong and clearly defined linkage between
MALIBNET and INSDOC; the flexible and
quick decision making process of the
society;
and
the
highly simplified
procedural formalities. With more support
from institutions and industries MALIBNET
can provide more usefui services which can
reach a much wider spectrum of user
community. In the absence of any
MALIBNET i s
Government
funding,
undoubtedly a model to be emulated by
other cities in lndia for evolving their library
networks.
