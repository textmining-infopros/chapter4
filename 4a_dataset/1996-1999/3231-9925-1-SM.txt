The Indian Database Scenario Portrayed Through INDAB
SN Sur* and BG Sunder Singh**

Abstract
There is a marked shift from predominantly library based bibliographic
information services to the generation of more factual, referral, numeric and
multimedia information products. Yet, comparing with the global
developments, we, the Indians are just at the starting line. In this article,
portrayed through INDAB the indigenous database efforts, their growth 81
status, availability, opportunities for development, and related strategies have
been analysed. It concludes that given some areas of strength and planned
growth, India should have increased opportunities in information services in
the years to come.

In response to a growing demand for
information services in the country in the 1960fs,
many. library and information centres started
providing various kinds of information services-of
which the abstracting/indexing services were
aimed at providing both current awareness and
selective
dissemination.
These
were
predominantly produced inhouse and by manual
methods. By the 1980's, the diffusion of
microcomputers, useful software and the
necessary skill development in library/information
centres had brought out improved production
methodologies and d e l i i of these services in
machine readable form. The provision of
information services still remained, and continues
to be so, in the domain of traditional providers
such as libraries and information centres and
largely accessible to inhouse users.

By the early go's, one could see changes in the
national outlook. The changes in terms of
liberalisation effect the way we have to do
business, while change in terms of globalization
stimulate how we generate knowledge and
therefore wealth. As a result of these changes,
there has been a perceptible increase in the use of
computers and telecommunication facilities-not
only in inhouse data processing but also in
providing information access and delivery to a
wider user population. Apart from the diffusion of
inforrnation technology at the workplace, there
have been a number of efforts to organise
indigenous information of utility and provide a
competitive edge to individuals and institutjans.
Besides the government funded initiatives in
different sectors, there is also a visible
participation from the public as well as private
sector institutions in providing information
services. Such services are now accessible not
only in local mode but also on a wider geographic
area-partially through improved marketing and
partially due to increased choices of information
delivery. For instance, apart from the traditional
bibliographic iriformation services through print
media, one now finds a migration to the digital

Yet
comparing wilb the global developments, we
are just at the starting line. For instance, in spite
of over 398 effotts kncrwn and recorded in
INDAB, on)). one database, i.e, CMlE Dabbase
is avaihMe on DIALOG. Given some areas of
strength and phnned gmwt)l, lndii should have
i m a s e d opportunities in infwmation services
in the years to come.

Descriptions and discussions on the various
aspeas of indigenous infwmation scenario may
be found ek~here.'''~"The INDAB database
is a conxiow effort to identify potential database
activities in the cwntry through data obtained
directly from the database producers; and where
this was m t posh&, pertinent data had to be
collated fmn the mmibble sources. The intention
was to identify the disparate efforts and on the
basis of the i n b t i o n dkcted, nurture and
deveiop such efforts into wider utilities and
facilitate a phnned devdopment of information
services on a national

&.

The reason to cover abstracting & indexing
services, directories and databases together at
this juncture is obvious. The traditional
bibliographic/referral services are generated in
machine readable form as byproducts of their
print equivalents. Simihdy, those which were
only in print media hiwe been or are in the
process of k i n g converted to their machine
readable forms.

Initially, INDABI attempted to
information from several sources like:

collect

U Directory of l d i n Scientific Periodicals.
INSDOC, 1990,
National Union Catalogue of Scientific Serials in India (NCICSSI). INSUOC, 1991.
Directory of periodicals published in India.
Sapra & Sapra, 1989.

13 Ulrich's international Periodicals C)irectory,
1994.

In addition to these sources, responses from
the database producers/sponsors obtained
through direct questionnaires are also included
in the update, i.e., INDAB2. Presently, INDAB2
has 398 records on the various information
services mentioned.
The database content designation is after the
Unesco's CCF/F Ialmost closer to The Gale's
Directory of Databases 1995 in the choice of
data elements], runs on Unesce's CDS/ISIS 3.07
software and under the MS-DOS.

2.1

The Size

INDAB2 contains descriptions of 398
'database' efforts-an increase by 105 entries
from the earlier edition. Updated information on
200 abstracting & indexing services, databases
and directories have been received directly from
the contributing agencies. Information on 198
efforts need to be further updated.

2.2

Type of Sewices/Dabbases/PducIs

There are 113 efforts which are reported to
be exdusively in their database form. Of the

202 abstractinghtdexing services, and 83
directories listed, only 45 and 43 respectively
are databases. Altogether 201 efforts have
resulted in the generation of machine readable
ftles/databases as shown in Table 1.

Government &partments/agencies
and
R&D organisations form the larger chunk of
contributors. Keeping in view dwindling
governmental support for purely academic
efforts, one finds the need for the development
of databases with commercial value and wider
accessibility as a stimuli for the information
industry. Once again the economic necessity
will compel joint efforts on the part of public
funded agencies which generate enormous data
and the commercial organisations that should
find opportunities for profits and business.

With the availability of cornputen, many
institutions are mating databases to meet their
requirements. For example, universities are
creating databases of their library cdlections as
well as other services. These databases are of
very generic nature comprising information on
all kinds of documents.

This pattern also suggests that it is the
commercial, S&T or R&D intensive activities that
might have a bearing on the need and hence
generation of information services.

Considering a span of Rve years, the
breakdown
of
the
number
of
services/databases/prOducts is given, which
indicates that there has been a spurt of
information activities since 1980s. Perhaps,
affhdability of computers, skilled manpower,

This was the time when NISSAT started
distributing CDS/ISLS and also helped diffuse
standards libe M C R I!, d CCF. This once
again is the period during which other
commercial database management systems like
dBASE Ill, FoxPro, Unify, Orade, LIBSYS and
noncommercial packages like MINISIS,

institutions with their computer facilities and
available manpower, developed local systems.

Database generation depends a lot on the
availability of the hardware and software to the
producer. The pattern also refleas the extent of
computer m g e in the various institutions. Most
of the database development has been on
Microcomputers and in a predominantly
library/information environment, CDS/ISIS is the
major software used .for this purpose. Indeed

There are at kale 130 products which are
priced. This form almost 33.3% of the total

individual users and another for institutional
consumers. Noteworthy among these are the
CSJR laboratories, Government institutions and

Opportunities for Indigenous
Development

Going by the trend,certain observations can
be made-the foremost is, that India is yet to
emerge as a global contributor in the

Secondly, several factors have contributed to
the recent indigenous database development
efforts. The hardware and software being no
more a constraint, what would appear short of
supply is the right kind of manpower, use of
relevant standards and hck of adequate backup
resources.
A pertinent question remains. Why
indigenous databases?Why should one have an
indigenous database development programme?
One could offer any number of justifications,
but these may be mainly under any of the
following imperatives: largely, there is a need to

+

Organise knowledge generated within the
country

e Access lndian conttibutions published
overseas

+

Provide access overseas to
knowledgebases

lndian

e Aid our own national efforts in resources
management and development.
What should be our priorities? Competition
with global database providers is far away for
India, but she should concentrate on areas of
her primary importance like population control,
food, shelter, health, agricolutre, and industries.
To begin with, there is a need to look for
opportunities and take appropriate initiatives in :

a Creation of databases in stronger areas-the
areas of potential opportunities are too many.
a Areas of database generation where in depth
treatment is wanting globally.

a Undertake activities of value addition and add
lndian Information of significant interest to the
global user.
Stronger points in India's favour in this
venture would be:

a Manpower skills-in the subject areas apart
from the area of database production,
telecommunication, vending and so on.

+

Low capital investments-considering the
cheaper input possibilities, we need to identify
potential areas of database efforts and with
utmost commitment generate globally
relevant products.

+

High labour utilisation-as database adivitiy is
not only capital intensive, but also more labour
intensive. Use of highly literate population
skilled in computer use and English, it would
be cheaper to take up such ventures.

+

High availability of S&T manpower which
could be used for knowledge capture,
integration and value addition.

+

Skill in use of English (to reach a gbbal market)

On the other hand, there is a need to take
note of d e r aspects. These are:
9

+

4.

The resources required for database
production are disparate and are highly
disorganised. Added to this, there is a general
weakness in our primary/secondary sources.
Even where they exist, there is a restricted
access-not only to capture data but dso to
c o d t when required. In a procedural
environment, resource sharing is at a
premium. Where it is possible, procedural
complexities damper any kind of 'database
devdopment'.
Nationally, institutions and organisations
suffer from !ow financial resources. Indeed
accessing basic scientific resources is more
a matter of money than anything. Added to
the poor resource allocations, poor work
culture and low marketing efforts hamper
indigenous efforts. Further, the concept of
Information as a saleable commodity is yet
to percolate the society and therefore it
becomes important to sensitise users and
the service providers.

ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES

Database activity is not only capital intensive
but also requires bng time commitments.
Besides, b grow cummerdaUy potential, larger
inputsin terms of expertise, manpower and
most important of these, information resources
are essential.

An aspect of database production should
also consider its economic viability as against as
a tool for welfare services. Most of the
indigenous efforts started as a means to meet
local requirements, suffer from limited or closed
access and also poor delivery mechanisms.
Added to these, data compilation entails huge
investments in terms of time, efforts, and costs.
For a wide, commercial access and delivery, the
shortest way of providing access is to put the
local, smaller databases on a web site and
therefore on htpmet 'Ihis would imply the skills
to convert data or generate data using HTML
and SGMLs need to be generated. Therefore,
manpower development also has an implication
in the activity.

5.

STRATEGIES

Several strategies are possible. One is to take
up databases in progress on print media.
Another area of work would be to digitize ttte
best of the Indian S&T periodicals both
retrospective coUections and current issues and
offer the delivery choices in CD-ROM format.
In the government sector, a huge amount of
data is collected, produced with very limited or
restricted access. The cost-delivery balance is
disproportionate and more importantly, it
remains unused. Therefore, there is a need to
organise the government tradeable information
into a powerful, widely accessible resource.
Trade statistics is another area of greater
importance. With the increased interest in ED1
and the use of Industrial codes in commodity
classification, appropriate trade statistics-both
import-export can be generated.
There has been a spurt of commercial
activities in the generation of various trade
Directories and Yellow pages. Directories Today,
Dunn & Bradstreet, Kompass India, Tata Yellow
Pages are some of these whose utility is being
increasingly felt. Apart from local access to the
huge data throush print medium, online access
to these sources would be essential.
In certain areas, databases have to be
developed de now. While there is a limited
interest in bibliographic information, efforts on
factual information have to increase.

While the demand for appropriate
information services wouM increase in future,
there is a need to fill up gaps in
commercial/business information and adopt a
strong market approach to the developmental
efforts: The industry would also need support
from financial institutions for support and
sustenance.
A database activity can be seen as a
conscious effort to organise and provide
effective access to the users of a
knowledgebase. One may also view the growth
of databases as a response to provide for
advantages that individuals, institutions or
nations may wish to gain. These advantages
could be in academic pursuits, in the process of
knowledge generation, in the promon
of
intellectual property rights, or gaining economic
dominance, business competitiveness and
political gains. Besides, these resources should
help one's efforts towards a sustainable
development
