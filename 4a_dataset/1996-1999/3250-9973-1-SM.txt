Library Networks in lndia

- An Overview

SS Murthy*
Abstract
This paper gives an overview of the development of library networks
in India. It also mentions the efforts made by the Planning
Commission, Government of India, to promote resource sharing
among libraries in the country. The present scenario of library
networking is also briefly presented. The main problems in early
operationalising the library networks include retro-conversion of
holdings data, non-availability of suitable software for operating large
databases and online searching in a wide-area-network mode at
prices affordable by all the libraries, lack of adequate standardisation
and non-availability of adequate training facilities to cover all the.
library staff participating in the network programmes. Some possible
solutions to these problelns are suggested.

1, INTRODUCTION
In the field of library science and
traditional librarianship, lndia was not
lagging much behind the advanced
countries in the past. The country produced
eminent library scientists and librarians
whose contributions to the subject
discipline were outstanding. Also, the spirit
of library cooperation flourished and library
resource sharing was practised by several
libraries in the form of inter-library loans,
circulation of documentation lists, current
awareness services, and so on. Even library
"ehorking was done in an informal mode
in certain cities in the country. The efforts

among its member libraries is one such
example. However, such efforts were
mostly informal and limited in scale.
The networking efforts in various
countries got a boost with the
tremendous and fast developments in

their holdings and in automating the library
activities, the former being the first priority.
Commonly, the periodical holdings are
attempted first in building up the databases
as i t takes less time than for the other types
of (ibrary documents. This is followed by the
databases of holdings of books, reports,
dissertations, standards, etc. The library
network centres (i.e., the coordinating
agencies of the networks] also are
concentrating on acquiring holdings of
databases of their member libraries and
merging them to. provide the user with
access to the total records. They provide
such access either by e-mail or online
through the telephone network. In addition,
these centres also try to provide a common
software for database development and
automation of (ib~aryactivities and services.
Table 1 gives the details of status of some
important library networks in the country.
It can

be seen that except OELNET and

(NFL(BNEt, most of the other library
networks have yet to develop databases of
library holdings in a significant way, Even
these two networks have to go a long way
to cover in their databases the entire

holdings of all the participating libraries,
Unless this is achieved, the networks would
not be able to achieve significant resource
sharing as well as rationalisation in library
acquisitions. Most of the networks are
however, making efforts towards this end by
conducting training programmes for the
staff of the participating libraries in data
capturing (covering library holdings),
database development, and automation of
library activities and services.

3.1

Database Development

Development and maintenance of
databases is a skill-oriented as well as
time-consuming activity. The enormity of
the task can be gauged ifone considers the
holdings of the major libraries in the
country. The holdings details of some of the
major libraries in the country are given in
Table 2.

In addition, each of the libraries of major
universities would have, on an average
about two lakh pub\ications/documents, If
the databases of such holdings are to be
developed using standard input format,
rules and procedures, and to simultaneously

maintain

acceptable quality standards of
the databases, the time normally required
would be about 4000 mandays per lakh of
documents if the data capturing is done
manually. If other databases are used for
downloading relevant records, the time may
come down by about 40 per cent.

Overview

(iv) If a library has already created a
database of its holdings, fully or partially,
using its own input format and other
rules and procedures, it would be very
reluctant to change them, if necessary,
to join a network. This reluctance is
mainly due to the cost of inputs required
to effect the change.

4, IMPEDIMENTS TO THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF
NETWORKS
In the development or establishment of
library networks, the following seem to be
the main problems faced by the Indian
libraries;
(i) It is difficult to enforce standards in data
conversion for creating databases of
library holdings particularly when
different libraries do this job
independently. Even if the same input
format and data entry procedure
(cataloguing rules, etc.) are followed,
there could be a significant variation in
the practices like depth of indexing, slant
in indexing or generating keywords, and
so on.

(ii) In a network, collections of large libraries
tend to be overused and therefore, such
libraries would be unwilling to become
part of the system unless there are
compensating incentives.
(iii) Libraries generally do not have the
necessary staff with adequate
expertise in database development
and in the use of network hardware
and software. This necessitates
organising training programmes
frequently and also on-the-jobtraining.
The training programmes presently
available are not adequate and they are
to be provided on a much larger scale
to cover all the interested library staff
in the country.
DESlDOC Bulletin of Inf Technot, 1IW6.16(2)

(v) Many libraries do not have adequate
resources for acquiring the hardware,
software and other facilities for joining
the network.
(vi) Many libraries do not have the software
which is tailored to their procedures and
which can function efficiently and
effectively in a wide-area-network
environment. They look for an efficient,
integrated software for library
automation and database development.
Many of the libraries presently use
CDS/ISIS; but prefer to switch over to
other software which can work more
efficiently with large collections and
users, for both the types of functions.
There are a few such software packages
available in the market in the country;
but many libraries, particularly academic
and public libraries, expect to receive it
free of charge or at a nominal price,
Some libraries which can afford to buy
the package at market price expect
proper customisation and efficient
after-sales-support from the supplier
which is not easily available to rhe
satisfaction of the buyers.
(vii) Many libraries do not usually get
adequate
support
from
the
managements of their institutions.

5. POSSlBLE SOLUTIONS
Libraries and library networks are making
efforts to get over these impediments.
However, while they may be able to solve
some of the problems through cooperative

Murthy

- Library Newtork in India-An OclernNIew

efforts among themselves, they would need
the help of supporting or funding agencies
to solve many other problems, particularly
those related to standardisation and quality
control. For instance, trained manpower is
not available for the data conversion job (to
develop databases). Also, none of the
university departments provide adequate
training in this activity. This situation
therefore necessitates engaging raw library
and information science post-graduates,
providing training to them and then using
them for the job. The libraries should
however not recruit personnel on regular
appointment for the creation of databases
covering
their
back
collections
(retrospective conversion) as the recruits
would not have adequate work once the
back\og is cleared. It would be therefore
preferable to engage external services on
contract for this job to clear the backlog
and the regular library staff should take care
of the updation of the databases on a
regular basis. Using contract services has of
course the risk of poor quality input, but it
could be overcome by enforcing strict
quality control measures. But again,
majority of the libraries do not have funds
for creating the databases.
The author has been closely associated
with some of the library networks like
DELNET, CAClBNET and INFLIBNET and
has had occasions to look into some of
these problems. Based on this association,
the following possible solutions are
suggested:
(a) The library networks should first compile
detailed rules and procedures which
should be in tune with the existing
standards for database development as
well as network operation and then
ensure their proper implementation by
the participating libraries.

(b) Usually, many common publications
exist in the acquisitions of different
8

libraries. The individual libraries must
therefore check, before filling an input
sheet, with the network office/database
to see if that title has already been
included in the database and if so,
download the entry instead of doing it
all over again. If such checking is done
among the networks themselves (since
most of them are supported by
Government, such coordination shou\d
not be difficult), there would be
considerable savings in human efforts
and expenditure.
The Government and the funding
agencies must provide financial support
for database creation in libraries and
library networks, as the expenditure
incurred on this wi(l pay back in terms of
rationalisation of library acquisitions,
resource sharing, and increased use of
information. It may be possible to have
allocation of funds for this purpose in the
annual and five year plans of the
Government, if the matter is taken up by
the libraries and networks through
proper channels.
(d) As an incentive to large libraries for
sharing their resources with small
libraries, a system of credits and debits
may be introduced. That is, a library
would get a credit point by lending a
document and a debit point by
borrowing a document. These points
may be settled in monetary or other
acceptable terms (as per network
guidelines) at regular intervals.
(e) The network managements must
organise practicals-based training
programmes as frequently as necessary
to train the staff of the participating
libraries. It would be good if teachers in
library science schools are also trained
along with practising library
professionals so that these teachers
DESlDOC Bulletlnof Jnf Technol,?996,1b(2)

Murthy

- Library Nehvorks in India-An

would in turn train their students year
after year.

(0

The network managements must also
pavide a common software on a
cost-to-cost basis for use in libraries on
request. It would be worthwhile to get
such a software developed, if it is not
already available. For such software,
thorough back-up technical support
must be ensured either directly by the
networks or through some contract
arrangement.

(g) The database development contractors
must be encouraged to come up in large
numbers to create databases on
contract including retrospective
conversion. This would speed up the
time-consumingtask of data conversion.
Since a large number of libraries and
information centres intend to create
databases, it will be lucrative business
for these contractors for a number of
years.

Overview

6. CONCLUS,ON
Development and management of
library networks involves high commitment
and tenacious work, particularly in the
Indian environment where majority of the
libraries do not have qualified and skilled
manpower and also the financial resources
to introduce automation and the current
information technologies. Cooperation, not
only among libraries, but also among library
networks is essential for the success of
these networks in the cguntry. While the
problems
and
suggested
solutions
mentioned above are only indicative, the
network managements have to niake
considerable efforts for detailed planning,
implementation, and successful operation
of networks. These efforts call for full-time
work; part-time efforts may not only affect
the
quality,
but
also delay the
implementation of the networks.
