ABSTRACT
This paper approaches the twin .objectives of library automation and
networking through the network route and e-mail route. The author
has dealt on software development, database development, and
network development in detail. The network also features a number
of special services.

1. INTRODUCTION
With a mandate to facilitate provision of
broadbased information services in the
count:)', the National System for Science &
Technology (NISSAT), Department of
Scientific
&
Industrial
Research,
Government of India, took up initiatives for
the
design
and
development
of
metropolitan library networks since 1985.
Caicutra Library Network (CALIBNET) is
one such product.
CALiBNET was inaugurated on 21
'September 1993 by Prof S K Sen, Minister
for Power, Scierice & Technology and NES,
Government of West Bengal.
Following
a
Memorandum
of
Understanding (MOU) in June 1994,
NISSAT assigned the role of Network
Coordination Agency to CALIBNET Society
(a society registered under West Bengal
Societies Registration Act, 1961). The
management of Network Services Centre

Director, CALIBNET, RCC Building, ladavpur
Un~versityCampus, Calcutta - 700 032

(NSC) was entrusted by NlSSAT to CMC
Limited till the Society was functional.
CAL~BNETSociety formallytook over the
infrastructural
facilities
of NSC on 29
November 1994, from CMC Limited.

1.1

Objectives

CALIBNET is being established to serve
the collective interest of Calcutta's
institutional
libraries
by
means
of
computer-based library automation and
networking,
- aimed at optimum utilisation of
bibliographic resources of these libraries by
a mechanism of resource sharing and
electronic access. The prime objective is to
institute systematic inter-library cooperation
and document delivery amongst the
libraries of Calcutta. Thereby, they can
stimulate and sustain resource sharing with
a view to largely free libraries from the
stranglehold of financial crunch.
CALIBNET adopts two routes to realise
its objectives : (1) the network route with:
a A library automation and networking
using i t s own application software
'MAITRAY EE'.

(2) the e-mail route to provide member
libraries with:

e Online access to various databases within
the network.

e Online access to information available
through Internet, DIALOGIKnight-Ridder,
and CD-ROM resources through ERL.

e Full-textdocuments through British Library

e Training and consultancy.

2. ESSENTBAL FEATURES
2.1

The Network Route

CALIBNET
is
essentially
a
computer-based network of Calcutta-based
libraries, comprehending total automation
of library operations and management
functions and their interconnection through
telecom lines. It will have online access to
international databases and search facilities
of CD-ROM-based databases at NSC. It has
a prized collection of international
databases on CD-ROM. A few of them are
Bibliofile, British National Bibliography, and
Inside Information, which provide access to
contents of over 10,000 high impact
journals.
Significantly, CALIBNET is a true library
network coming up on a technological
platform
of
program-program
communication between libraries in the
network, using its own application software
'MAITRAYEE'. The re-engineered version
3.0 is being ported on CALIBNET
participating institutions (Pis) Annexure.
Within the individual librdries, the
functions that will be automated are

acquisition
and
fund
accounting,
cataloguing, circulation, serials control, and
local user services. Users will be able to
locate books and serials through online
public access catalogue (OPAC). The
network services component will enable
CALIBNET libraries to query any remote
library hooked on the network; transfer files
across libraries, exchange messages, and
reply to queries from any of the in the
libraries network through e-mail.
The NSC will provide centralised
services such as online search of
international databases as well as search of
such databases held on CD-ROM at the
NSC itself. Current Awareness Service
(CAS),
Selected
Dissemination
of
Information (SDI) services, and back-up
support with full-text delivery; will
essentially function as a computercommunication
based
information
provider.
The NSC will also extend consultancy in
library
computerisation,
manpower
development and training, assistance to
nodal libraries on standardisation, local
automation, and retrospective conversion
of existing card catalogue into machine
readable format (Retrocon).

2.2

The E-Mail Route

Apart from the total automation and
network concept that CALIBNET envisages,
it has introduced and supports a
closed-circuit e-mail network for its member
institution libraries (Ml1.s). CALIBNET i s
transforming itself from a library network to
essentially an information network.

of

to serve a broad spectrum of information
seeking users.

The host system provided to NSC-the
WlPRO Landmark 486 and the operating
system WINIX-were incompatible with the
functional requirements of CALIBNET. This
factor along with certain deficiencies in the
application software MAITRAYEE which was
being developed by CMC Limited delayed
the implementation of CALIBNET. The
software, infact required reengineering to
overcome those problems and the CMC
has done the job. It had recently released
the revised version as MAITRAYEE version
3.0 and ported on Pls' systems and is under
observation at NSC. The host system at
NSC has also been recently replaced with
hardware of higher configuration and SCO
UNlX operating system. The combined
efficiency of MAITRAYEE (ver 3.0) and this
host system vis-a-vis functional requirements
of CALIBNET is currently under observation.

CALIBNET can now offer worldwide
information, searched online or on
CD-ROMs, contained in over 450
international databases. It is fast and
cost-effective way for one to obtain current,
accurate, and comprehensive information
critical to his/her day-to-day decision
making and professional pursuits.

4. A N E W D I M E N S I O N :
INFORMATION NETWORK
With the phenomenal advances made in
computercommunication technologies, the
library network is progressively making
room for the information network.
Consistent with this contemporary thrust
towards information network, CALIBNET is
coming up essentially as an information
provider-in tandem with its library network
implementation-with high-tech resources
for access, search, and retrieval of global
information already established.

5. RESOURCES AND SERVICES

Communication Linkages

CALIBNET recognises the fact that a
combination of modern computer and
communication facilities is the bedrock for
an efficient and contemporary information
network. Besides acquiring access to
trans-national services like Internet, the
information superhighway, and Dialmail, the
electronic mail service to c~mmunicate
with major information vendors worldwide,
it has accorded top priority for creating at
its NSC, a local hub of ERNET of the

The scheme for e-mail is as follows :
The MIL will provide a standard PC
computer running on DOS and a dedicated
telephone in its library.
CALIBNET will support the scheme by
offering loan to the MIL, the modem
required for e-mail operation, install the
e-mail node, and train the operator5. A
limited number of modems will be thus
offered every year o n first-ccme-first-setved
basis.
A
nominal one-time charge for
installation, training, and annual usage ie,\s

network in the country, can sustain itself
only when adequate demand is made on its
services. lnforn~ationuser response is highly
crucial for survival of the networks. A
vigorous and planned promotional drive,
preferably in conjunction with NISSAT, to
activate user consciousness, is the order of
the day.
