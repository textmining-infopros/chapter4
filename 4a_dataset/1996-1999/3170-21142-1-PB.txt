ABSTRACT
The article describes a telecommunications network conceptualised
in the University System of Georgia for educational, economic,
technological and cultural development of all sections of users. The
various aspects of GALILEO and technological resources used are
presented.

1, INTRODUCTION
The library administrators of University
System of Georgia (USG) have had a long,
sustained
history
of
cooperation,
networkin%andresourcesharing- Since
their formal organisation in 1968 into an
advisory committee to the USG Chancellor

and his Staff, the Regents Academic
Committee on Libraries, they have
discussed and debated issuesof resource
sharing. The group quickly recognised that
library resources can be effectively shared
only through library automation and the
application
of
telecommunications

tec~nology.

" Communication should be addressed to:
Dr Ralph E Russell, Pullen Library, Georgia State University
100 Decatur St SE., Atlanta, C A 30303-308 1, USA.
Dr Russell has been named The Research Librarian of the Year by the American Library Asociation's Assoc!ation
of College and Research Libraries
*" Chancellor's Staff.

Russell et a1 - Georgia's GALlL EO

In 1989, PeachNet, a telecornmunications pathway to connect all thirty-four
institutions in the USG, began. A newly
appointed Vice Chancellor for lnforrnation
Technology invited the librarians to
proactively work with him and his staff to
plan our future.
The planning group
conceptualised and discussed the plan that
was to eventually be named GALILEO
(Georgia Library Learning Online). It could
not, however, emerge as a viable program
until 1994.
A new Chancellor for the USG, Dr
Stephen R Portch, arrived in the summer of
1994 and immediately called for proposals
for
projects
which
would
be
technology-intensive, benefit all levels of
institutions in the USG, and would have
obvious benefit to undergraduates. The
four-year old library proposal was exactly
that.
After some consultation and
discussion, Chancellor Portch incorporated
the proposal into an array of initiatives for
which he was seeking support from the
Governor and his staff, and then funding
from
the
Georgia Legislature. The
Legislature approved and funded A Vision
for One Statewide Library, the name used
by the Chancellor and his staff for
GALILEO, for 10 million dollars to be spent
in Fiscal Year (FY) 95 and FY96. We were
off and running-and faced with immediate
deadlines and more questions than could
be articulated-not to mention answered!

GALILEO is a USG initiative with an
open design and architecture and an
invitation to other collaborating partners to
join. The collaborating partners include the
publicly funded technical schools, the
private colleges and universities, the public
library systems, and the K-12 (Kindergarten
to Grade 12) public school media centres
[See Fig 1 J. In essence, with all
collaborators participating, a statewide
information
infrastructure supporting
18

educational, economic, techno~ogical, and
cultural development will be in place.
GALILEO, with an array of electronic
information sources and enhanced user
services, places Georgia in the forefront of
information technology applications. Other
states have statewide networks, but few
have the breadth and depth of GALILEO.
Governance,
communications,
and
oversight of the project will continue to
change as more partners join. A major
challenge will be to maintain the sense of
'bottom-up' development and collegial
participation based on shared values rather
than top down dictation as is the case in
some networks.

2. COMPONENTS OF GALlLEO
GALILEO has
components:

the

following

eleven

1. Electronic information resources,
2. Core academic journals, indexes, an(
full text,

3 . Research journals,
4. State census data,

5. Distribution of state publications,
6. First Search,

7. Encyclopaedia Britannica,
8. PeachNet,

9. Automating libraries,
10. Retrospective conversion, and
1 1. Universal borrowing.

2.1

Electronic Information Resources

A number of electronic information
resources are part of this project. It was
decided that the needs could best be
served by establishing two database servers
in the state for locally mounted resources
and also using these servers as gateways to
other resources available elsewhere on the

Internet. Database servers are located at
the University of Georgia in Athens and
Georgia State University in Atlanta.
BCLC's Site Search was selected as a
search engine because i t is a local version
of the search engine used for OCLC's First
Search. Access to First Search was highly
desired by librarians in the USG and Site
Search, as a local search engine, provides
seamless linking to First Search.
An added, critical advantage of Site
Search is that it is fully compatible with the
239.50 standard for open information
systems. Further, OCLC offered a package
called WebZ which is a set of development
tools and supports the creation of pages
and forms that are compatible with the
various browsers that have been created for
the World Wide Web.
Mosaic and
Netscape are the two most commonly used
browsers and they provide a graphical
interface that makes use of the Internet and
the World Wide Web much easier and
more exciting. The combination of Site
Search and WebZ permits an arrangemefit
where the client workstations simply
requires a web browser like Mosaic or
Netscape. Development time is greatly
reduced, and there is no special software to
distribute to the client workstations.
Of course, support for a graphical user
interface
requires
a
sophisticated
workstation. IBM compatible workstations
with Pentium processors and 16 megabytes
of memory running Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups were selected. These were
connected to local area networks in each
library which were in turn connected to
PeachNet. For those users who did not had
access to workstations that could support a
graphical web browser, support was
provided by Lynx, a software package that
can take a graphical page from the World
Wide Web and display i t on a non-graphical
20

or character-based workstation. Thus, wide
access to GALlLEO was made available.

2.2

Core Academic journals,
indexes and Full Text

There are about 2,500 core academic
journals that are required to support any
program of undergraduate instruction. One
of the main goals of this project i s to
provide all students and faculty with
indexes and abstracts to these core
journals. In addition, (and this i s a key
component) the full text of many of these
journals is now available through third party
vendors. GALlLEO provides indexes and
abstracts to these core academic journals as
well as the full text of as many of these
journals as are available.
After considerable investigation and
comparison, the databases of University
Microfilms Inc. (UMI) were selected. Two of
the UMI databases were of major interest:
Periodical Abstracts, a database that covers
about 1,600 journak in all fields and
provides the full text of about 650, and ABI
Inform, a database that covers about 1,000
journals in business and economics and
provides the fuH text for about 500 journals.
Together, these two databases provide
indexing and abstracts for over 2,600 titles
and the full text for over 1,100 of these
titles.
Full text coverage for additional
journals is being added on an ongoing
basis.
In addition to Periodical Abstracts and
ABi Inform, the following UMI databases
have also been acquired:
e+ Business Dateline-a fu6l text database
drawn from regional business magazines
and the business sections of a variety of
newspapers;

Newspaper Abstracts-provides indexing
and abstracts for 29 US newspapers; and
DES/DOC Bulletin of lnf iechnol, 1996,16( 1)

Russefi et a! - Georgia's GALILEO

+

Dissertation Abstracts-compiles abstracts
for all doctoral dissertations written in the

U.S.
Also, ERIC, a file that provides indexing
and abstracts for articles and reports in
education is available.

2.3

Research journals

Beyond the core academic journals,
there are many journals that record and
report research. These research journals are
essentid to university level institutions as
well as to faculty and students throughout
the System. Current Contents was selected
to support access to research journals.
Mounted on the GALILEO database
servers, this database indexes over 7,500
research journals in all disciplines and
provides abstracts for journals in the
sciences and social sciences. Coverage
back to 1992 has been made available and
the database is updated weekly.
At this time, full text is not available
electronicaily so articles that are not held by
the home library must be requested
through interlibrary loan. To expedite this
process, holdings information for the USG
libraries will be loaded and connected to
the citations. Thus, students and faculty will
search Current Contents and locate articles
of interest.
They can then quickly
determine if their local library owns the
article. If not, they will be presented with a
interlibrary loan request screen that they
can complete online. This request will go to
their local interlibrary loan office and
forwarded to the holding library. High
speed telefacsimile (fax) machines and staff
have been funded for the larger libraries for
this purpose.

2.4

State Census Data

The data contained in the US Census
pertaining to Georgia are of great interest
for research and instruction as well as for
DESIDOC Bulletin of lnf Technol,1996.16(1)

economic development, but the process of
obtaining needed data is cumbersome and
obsolete. As part of GALILEO, the most
used portions of the US Census will be
digitised and mounted online and made
available throughout the state and to others
on the Internet. It is expected to be
available in early 1996.

2.5

Distribution of State Publications

Under state law, the University of
Georgia Library is responsible for acquiring
and making available all publications o f
state agencies. To meet this obligation,
funding has been provided to scan and
store these publications eiectronically and
distribute them across PeachNet. Universal
access to these publications will support
instruction, research, and service activities
at all University System institutions as well
as provide a valuable public service by
permitting anyone with access to the
Internet to view these documents. Funding
has been provided for the hardware and
software needed to scan, store, and
distribute these publications and for staff to
do the work. This portion of the project will
be operational in early 1996.

2.6

First Search

The strategy adopted for GALiLEO is to
mount the most heavily used databases
locally on the two database servers in the
state and then to rely upon First Search for
those databases whose volume of use does
not justify the expense of local mounting.
Analysis indicates that the more
frequently a database i s used, the more
economical it is to load it locally. When
fully implemented, users will not know if a
database is mounted focally on Site Search
or is available remotely on OCLC First
Search.
21

Russell et a l - Georgia's CALJLEO

En addition to the above services, an
arrangement was also negotiated to provide
access to the World Wide Web version of
the Encyclopaedia Britannica to all students
and faculty of the University System of
Georgia.
This
prestigious
online
encyclopaedia is updated continuously and
also provides links to other resources on the
Internet. For example, if a patron retrieves
the article on 'nematodes,' he or she can
read the article and then connect to an
information service
on the subject
maintained by the University of Nebraska.

2.8

PeachNet

An important part of the GALILEO
project consisted of connecting all System
libraries to our state telecommunications
network, PeachNet. Fortunately, only two
libraries were not connected at the time the
project was funded, but they had campus
projects already underway.
Thus, no
initiative funds were needed to make
network connections to libraries. Another
concern
for
network
services was
off-campus
instruction
sites.
Seven
approved centres were designated for
inclusion within the project. Moreover,
since all centres except two were already
connected to the network, funds only had
to be provided for PeachNet connections at
those sites.

2.9

Automating Libraries

CALILEO includes a component to
automate unautornated USC libraries.
Although most libraries in the University
System had automated their catalogues and
most services, there were still seven
two-year colleges who had not begun the
process. Automating these remaining
libraries is important because it was
recognised that significant portions of each
library's collection, regardless of its size, are

unique within the University System. An
important goal was that all students and
faculty be able to search the bibliographic
files sf all libraries through on-line
catalogues and union lists.

A n automation plan was developed to
share the PALS automated library system at
Georgia State University and the D K A
(Data Research Associates, Inc.) automated
system through DeKalb College. As i t
turned out, four colleges selected PALS anrl
three selected DRA. The project provided
computer upgrades at both Georgia State
and DeKalb, as well as a minimum of four
workstations at each institution dedicated
to the automated system.

2.1 0 Retrospective Conversion
To enhance resource sharing, GALILEO
provides funds to convert all remaining
USG
catalogue
records
to
machine-readable form. This effort is closely
related to the automation plan. While most
libraries had automated and converted
most of their records, significant portions of
many collections remained only in card
form. A survey showed a total of 1,592,759
records to be converted, representing
monographs, serials, audio-visual (A/V)
materials, rare books, and a large number of
government documents. Since funds were
restricted, priority was given to libraries that
were not automated and to general
circulating collections. Accordingly, about
650,000
catalogue records will
be
converted to machine-readable form as part
of the GALILEO project by OCLC. The
South-eastern Library Network (SOLINET)
provides
training
and
support
for
institutional profiling, as well as project
management. All records were added to the
OCLC database, significantly enriching
information available to all library users.

Russell et a l - Georgia's GALILEO

2.1 1 Universal Borrowing
A portion of GALILEO which supports
universal borrowing will require some time
to implement. Not every document can or
will be available in electronic form.
Documents will still need to be moved
around the University of Georgia System.
CALILEO uses both fax and document
delivery for document transfer. To make
more effective use of fax, standardised fax
machines were purchased for each library
so that articles and shorter documents
could be faxed among system institutions.
Moreover, large, high-speed fax machines
were placed in each university with a high
volume of interlibrary lending. These are
state-of-the-art fax machines, using a
planetary scanner and digital copier. With
this design, books and bound journals can
be faxed face-up, with the operator only
having to turn pages and transmit the
image. The need to photocopy prior to
faxing or to place a document face-down
on a platen for each fax transmission is
eliminated, thus, considerably speeding up
the process of sending copies between
libraries.
Delivery of larger documents is by a
conventional
delivery
service.
A
system-wide contract with United Parcel
Service (UPS) is providing second-day
delivery between colleges and universities
of the USG. UPS .is providing special
shipping materials, drop boxes, collections
and
deliveries
at
each
library.
Standardisation of materials and preprinting
of shipping labels will reduce overhead and
simplify clerical routines to send interlibrary
loans. Also, as part of the premium service,
UPS fully tracks each shipment and
guarantees delivery within the contract
time. The service, however, is only to be
used among units of the University System
since billing is centralised and supported by
the GALILEO Project.
DESlDOC Bulietin of lnf Technol,1996.16(1)

Another aspect of the Universal
Borrowing
component
of
GALILEO
concerns a central database of eligible
borrowers. The USG has had, for a long
time, a system-wide card that can be issued
to faculty and students wishing to use
another library in the University of Georgia
System. The card, however, must be
individually processed and is not always
carried by students or faculty wishing to
borrow materials from another institution.
To improve access, a database is being
constructed at Georgia State University
with the patron records of faculty, staff, and
students at all thirty-four USG institutions.
Each college and university will be
responsible for maintaining its records and
will be able to query the database to verify
if a borrower from another campus is valid.
The existing campus identification card will
still be used for identification, but
verification will be on-line over the network.

3. THE FUTURE
GALILEO, then, includes an array of
electronic information sources ranging from
full texts of journals to an encyclopaedia to
census data on the state of Georgia. Its
graphical user interface makes it easy to use
and its foundation on commonly used Web
browsers like Mosaic and Netscape make it
readily accessible. While still in its early
stages of operation, GALILEO shows every
sign of being successful and plans are
underway to bring in other collaborating
partners: other academic libraries, public
libraries, technical school libraries, and K-12
media centres in the state.
Through Regents Academic Committee
on Libraries, joint acquisition decisions are
being made to select databases for
mounting locally. Decisions are made on
the basis of what resources have the
broadest appeal across the USG: basic
periodicals
indexes,
broad
cokerage

Russell et aE - Georgia's CALILEO

business index, a general encyclopaedia.
Broad-based appeal will continue to be a
criterion as librarians consider resour<&s
such as basic directories, basic literary
reference sources, primary newspapers, and
the many
and
allied health programs offered in USG
institutions. Acquisitions and collection
management decisions, including such
issues as journal cancellations, collection
analysis. remote storage of Paper materials.
collection use, and preservation will be
considered in the context of supporting the
State, rather than. a single institution.
Initially 'those decisions will be made
among the 34 USG institutions, but in
future, collection management decisions
could be made among other types of
libraries based on collecting interest and
geographical location.
Electronic reserves is another area for

Many of the
which faculty currently reserve for students
in their classes could be scanned in and
made available electronically. This would

documents, and improve accessibility.

that
