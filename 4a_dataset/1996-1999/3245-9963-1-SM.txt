ABSTRACT

This article presents the efforts of Atlanta-Fulton Public Library in
providing lnternet access and database search services to information
seekers encompassing homes, schools and offices. Two main features
of this lnternet initiative described are : Adult learning service and
lnternet access to high schools.

I. AFPL-INTERNET INITIATIVE

In November 1994, the Atlanta-Fulton
Public Library (AFPL) began offering
Internet access to approximately 300,000
registered patrons from its 34 branches
and through remote 24-hour dial-up
communication equipment. In addition,
the
library
implemented a special
partnership with all twenty-three of Atlanta
City and Fulton County high schools
through which i t provides lnternet access
to the Library's commercial information
databases and electronic mail (e-mail)
accounts. This lnternet initiative was begun
to address the two most critical Library
long-range goals: To support adult
independent learning and schools. The

Fulton County, which encompasses much
of Atlanta, is one of the largest and
most diverse counties in the United
States.
The lnternet initiative was developed
as a key component of the Library's
ongoing three-year technology plan. The
technology plan was developed by the
library administration and was approved
by the Library Board of Trustees to
reflect the library's goals for patron
service.
It
is
revised annually to
incorporate advancements in technology
and to ensore effectiveness and flexibility
in addressing the Library's goals.
In 1993, as part of this plan, the
Library decided to become an Internet
node via the South-eastern regional

'Assistant Director for System Support & Technical Development

Agnew - lnternet initiative at Aelanta-Fulton Public Library

provider# SURANet (now known as BBN
Planet), in order to provide database and
e-mail access to its patrons. It was hoped
that lnternet access will enhance the
Library's teiecommunications structure and
provide alternate telecommuting routes
to the Library's resources. It became
evident that lnternet was becoming a
major publishing medium for critical
information resources. For example, it
was clear that the internet would shortly
become the most important publishing
source for much of the government
information.
In fact, in the past two
years, the Internet has gone beyond
government
and
locally-produced
information to become one of the most
important
sources
for
multimedia
information.

It was decided that the Library's initial

lnternet offering would be a web server
with
selected
text-only
information
databases. In addition, the Library would
offer lnternet accounts and e-mail access
to educational projects in Atlanta city
and Fulton County high schools. Although
many interactive lnternet web-sites seemed
specifically
geared to
middle
and
elementary schools, the Library focused
first on high schools to ensure that
students graduated to higher education
or the job market with a basic familiarity
with the information superhighway.

The
Atlanta-Fulton Public
Library
became an Internet node through BBN
Planet and purchased a ClSCO 7000
router and CSU/DSU to connect via
leased TI line to the Atlanta point of
presence (POP). The ClSCO 7000 router
was selected for its scalability for wide
area networking, as well as its packet
filtering and superior routing capabilities.

The Library utilised a fan-ut box as
a
place-holder for
a
forthcoming
high-speed switched network currently
under development. A competitive bid
was issued for an internet service provider
to implement the server, web browser
and e-mail applications. A requirement
for the lnternet was that it should serve
as a gateway to remote branches via
the library's mainframe integrated library
system-CARL.

One of the basic tenets of the Library's
technology plan i s that technology is
used to provide equitable access to
resources at all library branches. All
technology was therefore designed and
implemented to accomplish this objective.

An Ethernet gateway card and TCP/IP
were already available on the mainframe,
in anticipation of the need to gateway
LAN (Local Area Network) services to
branches.
The Library's online system
vendor-CARL Corporation-was awarded
the bid and provided a Sun SPARC-5
workstation for the lnternet server, LYNX
web client/server software, and Pine
e-mail.
In 1993, the Library began offering
its PASSPORT electronic reference service,

which provided access to its online
catalogue, commercial databases and
reference sources such as the Academic
American Encyclopaedia, Facts on File,
Company
Profile,
a
directory
of
corporations, and EBSCO's MasterFile, a
collection of 350 full-text magazines. In
1995, The Atlanta lourna//Constitution
full-text, in ASCII format, was added to
this service. In addition, the catalogues
of fourteen CARL libraries around the
country, primarily large public libraries,
are available as PASSPORT databases.

Another
tenet
of
the
Library's
technology plan is ease of access. All
information services are designed, as
much as possible, to be available at the
same workstation in a user-friendly format.
The
PASSPORT electronic
reference
service was therefore designed and
developed as a 'one stop shop'. The
Library's lnternet databases are integrated
with the public access catalogue and
mainframe reference databases.
The
Library's web server or 'window to the
Internet' is an option on the PASSPORT
main menu on all 465 public access
catalogue workstations in all 34 branches.

2. ADULT L E A R N I N G SERVlCE
The Library's web server home pages
were designed to provide critical adult
independent learning and skill needs.
More than eighty databases are currently
provided in the following areas: Electronic
Reference Desk; Business and Economics;
Government Agencies and Information;
Career and Job Market Resources;
Geography and History; Health and
Nutrition;
Science;
Literature
and
Biography;
Recreation;
and
School
Resources. In February, 1995, dial-up
access was provided to all library patrons,
who can dial-up from their homes, schools
or offices, to all of the Library's PASSPORT
databases, including the 'window to the
Internet'. The Library's internet access
was heavily promoted on the Library's
cable channel and through press releases
and a front page article in the Atlanta
Journa//Constitution. Dial-access brochures
and instruction guides were posted at
each workstation. The Library's lnternet
Project Team trained Library 'Internet
Experts', who then trained the other
library staff. The result has been a
user-friendly internet gateway which is
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol,1996.16(1)

currently accessed approximately 5,500
times per month by library patrons.

The only serious technical difficulty
has been the inability of the Library's
graphical
user
interface
(GUI)
workstationEverybody's Catalogue-to
provide lnternet gateway access. The
Library purchased Everybody's Catalogue
with grant money while the product was
still in development. The Library served
as a beta tester of the product and
assisted the vendor in resolving difficulties
with database access and indexing. The
product has evolved into a mature,
user-friendly navigational tool that is very
attractive to patrons and staff. lnternet
access, however, was the most difficult
to resolve, but i s currently in test for
public release.

3, SUPPORT FOR HIGH
SCHOOLS
In addition to the widest possible
patron access, the Library installed two
ClSCO 516 communication servers for
dedicated dial-up access to the lnternet
server by Atlanta and Fulton County
high schools.
The Atlanta and Fulton
County school systems, in 1994, were
mostly entry-level computer users. To
ensure smooth, efficient installation and
access, the Library made several hardware
and process decisions.
The Telebit WorldBlazer modem was
selected for communication between the
schools and the Library's lnternet server,
for several reasons. The modem supports
many speeds and protocols and can step
down to slower phone lines, but can
also step up when a faster line i s
encountered.
Fulton
County
is

fast-growing, and public utilities have not
kept up with growth. Outlying areas with
rapid expansion, in particular, may have
poor phone service. In addition, the
modem's two-year warranty, extendable
to four years at minimal cost, has resulted
in
reduced
ongoing
equipment
costs.
Ongoing
maintenance
is
always
a
major
maintenance
consideration with any hardware and
software purchase for the Library, for
seasons of cost effectiveness and reliable,
uninterrupted performance.
To ensure smooth functioning with
minimal technical support to the schools
for lnternet connection, the Library
required a standard modem and standard
communications software package. This
greatly reduced the number of variables
to be tested, and assured familiarity with
hardware and software for remote
troubleshooting at the Library computer
room.

Although the schools purchased their
fax/modems, the Library installed the
modems and the ProComm Plus software
at the schools. This eliminated start-up
problems due to faulty installation and
set-up.
Twenty-one
schools
were
connected online within three weeks.
School support has not required more
than three on-site hardware service calls
monthly since the project began.

The WorldBlazer modem also assures
smooth, stable, secure telecommunications
traffic through the use of a proprietary
protocol to provide callback service to
the dialling stand-alone school modem,
for only those phone number programmed
into the rackmount modems at the library
computer centre. Each school's phone
is
programmed
on
two
number

rackmounts, to ensure flexible access.
Each school knows which others share
its modems, so that as use becomes
heavy, or if a class is scheduled, schools
can negotiate with each other for
dedicated access. To date, no availability
problems have been reported by the
schools, although schools average between
58 and 77 login sessions daily. As a
result, the dial-in service as designed
approximates the security and reliability
of leased-line access at considerably iess
cost. The ClSCO 5 16 communications
servers fully support all functionalities and
protocols of the ClSCO 7000 router and
the WorldBlazer modems.

A key component of the school
partnership was the involvement of school
administrators, teachers and students in
wery phase of project design and
implementation. A -decision was made to
offer Internet access in the media centre
of each high school. The media centre
co-ordinators for the city and the county
participated in initial project design and
in database selection for the web server
School Resources home page, which
- provides interactive learning experiences,
on Kidlink Gopher, NASA SpaceLink and
Classroom Earth and access to the
Library's PASSPORT electronic reference
service. Teacher and media specialist
resources such as AskERlC and Empire
lnternet Schoolhouse, are also provided
on the School Resources home page. A
focus group of students and teachers
pre-tested and critiqued the training
program and web server. As a result,
the Library provided an intensive 'training
the
trainer'
workshop
for
six
people-media
specialist, students and
teachers-at each school. These six people
then became the trainers and resource

staff at each school.

Each school was provided with Pine
email access and an e-mail address for
interactive education projects. One class
immediately began to participate in a
project with Tufts University. A high
school German class began an e-mail
correspondence project with an English
class in a high school in Germany. The
Library's
lnternet
Project
Manager
encourages
lnternet
use
through
promotional contests,
regular e-mail
communication, surveys and visits to
schools to meet with students, media
specialists and teachers.

lnternet use in the high schools is a
stable, reliable service that provides access
to the library's selected lnternet resources
and to the Library's PASSPORT electronic
reference service. Providing secure access
via lnternet to PASSPORT helps to prevent
bottlenecks on the public dial access
lines.

There were several challenges that
emerged in the high school lnternet
project. The greatest challenge was the
lack of computer expertise in the media
centres, which was resolved by requiring
standardised hardware and software and
providing installation and ongoing support.
An unanticipated concern has been the
difficulty in understanding and working
with
school structures for ongoing
enhancements to the project. Technology
co-ordinators are being appointed for the
Atlanta high schools and appear to be
a better resource, along with existing
curriculum committees in both school
systems, for encouraging active classroom
use for educational projects than the
school media centres. On the other
DESlDOC Bulletin ofInf Technoi,1996,16(1)

hand, the school media centre provides
centralised access to
lnternet
and
FASSPORT
databases
for
student
independent study and research.

Another
issue
currentiy
under
discussion has been the Library's interim
policy of allowing access only to
databases selected by the Library. This
is accomplished by disabling the Lynx
'Go' command, which opens URLs. This
was a feature requested by the city and
county Media Centre Co-ordinators. As
teachers and students become more
familiar with Internet, however, they are
increasingly requesting unrestricted access
to the Internet.
The Library i s also
currently the only public library in the
metropolitan area to offer lnterne t access.
To date, the public has not clamoured
for unrestricted access but, as other
metropolitan
public
libraries
offer
unrestricted lnternet access via PeachNet,
the Atlanta-Fulton Public Library can
expect that its patrons will begin to ask
this capability. The Library's interim policy
is that lnternet materials are selected,
just as other library materials, tb meet
patron information needs, but this policy
is currently under review.

4. CONCLUSION
The Library i s continuing expansion
of its lnternet initiative through several
new projects. Local databases are currently
in development to provide Library-specific
Olympics
information,
such
as
bibliographies and
frequently
asked
reference questions. These databases are
primarily designed to support s ~ h o o l
projects and assignments. Fulton County
government databases, to be offered in
a Fulton County home page tentatively

titled 'InfoFul~onbrealso in development.

The most exciting development is the
Library's
plan
to
upgrade
its
telecommunications to frame relay and
to provide a FRAD/router/hub at each
branch to access lnternet multimedia
databases and text-based CD-ROM at all
its branches.
Among other products,
the InfoNautics Homework Helper, which
includes full-text magazines, newspapers,
encyclopaedias with full i/lustrations; will

30

be offered at no cost to patrons in
every branch. The Everybody's Catalogue
will launch the Netscape client browser
to provide full graphics access to lnternet
databases, including Homework Helper,
in each Library branch. The Library
continually monitors its hardware and
software infrastructure to ensure that
Fulton County patrons can take full
advantage of the expanding world of
lnternet
resources,
to
meet
their
information, education and life skill needs.
