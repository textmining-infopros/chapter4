INTRODUCTION

Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay,
as recommended by the Sarkar Committee, was
established in the western region of the country
in 1958 with the co-operation and participation
of UNESCO utilising substantial assistance from
the then Government of USSR. It is situated at
Poyai, in a campus, extending over an area of
550 acres (220 hectares) amidst picturesque
surroundings with Vihar and Powai Lakes on
either side. There are 13 departments and 14
centres, having a total student strength of
2,200. Out of which 998 are undergoing
postgraduate courses and doing research. The
faculty strength is 380.
The library of IIT Bombay was established in
the year 1958. The annual book budget
(including periodicals) for the year 1991-92 was
Rs 1.63 crores. By the end of March 1996, it
had a collection of over 337,000 documents
and subscribed to 1,2 10 periodicals.

2.

METHODOLOGY

For data collection, two questionnaires (one
each for the librarian and the users) were
designed. Both the questionnaires were tested
by conducting a pilot study at IIT Library, Delhi.
DESlDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 1999,19(4 & 5 )

Suitable suggestions made by the Librarian and
the users were considered while finalising these
questionnaires. Librarian's questionnaire was
sent through mail. Two reminders were sent but
no response was received, then the help was
sought from a Delhi based research scholar,
who acted as an agent. He was given another
set of questionnaire for the Librarian who filled
up the same.
At the same time, questionnaire for users
were also distributed by the same agent among
postgraduate
students (PG) and research
scholars (RS). He was briefed
by the
investigator about the purposes of survey and
answers to the possible queries of the users.
Questionnaires to the faculty members (FM)
were mailed directly along with a request letter.
Persuasion and follow up action was taken by
the agent and 55 per cent response was
received from FM. When the questionnaires
were distributed, the library was in the initial
stage of computerisation. But later on with the
emerging needs, various library operations were
'computerised. Therefore, recently a third
questionnaire on Computerisation of Library
was designed and-the same was mailed to the
Librarian in June 1997. Reminders were sent
through e-mail and the data was thus collected.

20.5 per cent and students 10.2 per cent of
their respective population size. The response
rate for FM and students was 55 per cent and
73 per cent respectively. It was calculated on
the basis of questionnaires distributed under
each respective category.
A total of 180 questionnaires (Table 1 ) were
distributed among the users, 1 1 8 (65.5 per
cent) filled in questionnaires, consisting of 43
(55.1 per cent) FM and 75 (73.5 per cent)
students were received back. The study focuses
on a group of users involved in the
advancement of knowledge, teaching and
research, therefore, undergraduate students
were excluded.
The analysis in the following pages is based
on responses received from the librarian and
118 users. In addition, official records of the
library and Institute like files, records, reports

Collection Development

3.1

Acquisition

Library collection is being developed on the
recommendation of various departments of the
Institute. However, the librarian and his staff
also select books under the categories of
generalia and
reference books.
Every
department can make recommendation for
purchase of books within its allocated amount.
Books are acquired through publishers and
agents. These are also procured through
exhibitions, organised periodically by publishers
and book sellers. This method besides helping
in acquisition, also results in creating awareness
among users about
new. publications.
lnstkutional and serial publications, including
annuals are acquired on standing order basis. It
is a depository library for NASA, and Indian

3.1.1 Users' Opinion
The response regarding users' requests for
purpose of documents needed by them and
action taken by the library has been analysed in
Table 2 which reveals that majority of FM
request the library for purchase of documents
and the library takes care of such requisitions.
However, such requests made by students have
been comparatively less. About the number of
periodicals subscribed to by the library,
satisfaction is far more among FM. As regards
relevance of these periodicals both categories
of users have found subscribed periodicals to
be most relevant but majority of the stpdents
are not satisfied with number of periodicals
subscribed.

3.2

Growth

Collection has grown over a period of time
(Table 3) which reveals maximum growth during
1961162-1965166 with an average annual
increase of 27.73 per cent. Subsequent period
has shown a decreasing growth trends with

minor variations during 1978179-1982183 and
1987188-1989190. However,' later an increase
i n growth o f document collection has been
witnessed during 1989/961990/91. Over the
total period of 34 years, the collection has
grown at an average rate of 7.1 9 per cent.

Periodicals, their Acquisition and
Growth

3.3

Periodicals form the backbone of the library.
Financially it has been very difficult to continue
even the same number of subscriptions without
getting additional funds every year. Table 4
reveals continuous growth in the number of
periodicals subscribed until 1989190, though, at
varying rate. Maximum average growth (5.68)
has been exhibited during 1970/71-1975176,
thereafter, by and large there has been a
decreasing trend of growth. The annual average
growth over the period of 34 years
(1961162-1994/95), shows that during the last
two years, the subscription of periodicals has
been substantially reduced, bringing an overall
decline in the rate of growth to 0.74 per cent
per annum.

In view of the shortage of funds, the library
makes requests from year to year to the
academic community to drop some periodicals
for which they normally do not agree. Under
such circumstances, the librarians have been
deleting less used periodicals to meet the
financial crisis to some extent.

3.4

Use

Periodicals (Table 5) are used frequently by
all the FM. Other categories of documents,
used frequently by them, in the order of
priority are general books (83.6%), reference
books (81.3%), seminar/tonference papers
(81.3%), text books (48.8%) and reports
(41.7O10).
The
other
categories
like
patentslstandards,
theses/dissertations,
non-book materials and maps/diagrams/ charts,
etc., are used by a very low percentage of FM.
A very high percentage of students (93.3%) use
text books frequently, followed by reference
books (86.6%) and periodicals (84%). Majority
of students rarely use general books, reports,
patents/standards,
theses/dissertations,
seminars/conference
papers,
non-book
materials and maps/diagrams/charts, etc.

3.5

Adequacy

Table
that the
of general
books, text books, reference books, periodicals,

seminars/conference papers are considered to
be adequate
by majority of the users.
However, the collection of other categories
namely, reports, patentslstandards, theses/
dissertations, maps/charts/diagrams, etc. are
also regarded adequate by students but
majority of FM have not given their opinion
about these as well as non-book materials.

READER'S SERVICES

The library provides various kinds of services
(Table 7 to its users. In addition, it also provides
book bank and document tracing service (not
listed in the Table).

4.1

User Awareness of Library
Services

Reader's services have been grouped under
nine categories and user's response about their
awareness has been presented in Table 7 which
reveals that all the FM were aware about the
provision of photocopying and interlibrary loan
services. Majority of them were also aware
about other services like reference (97.6%),
lending 95.3%), bibliographical (95.3%), CAS
(88.3%), and translation 60.4%. However,
among students, majority of them were aware
of the provision of lending (93.3%),
photocopying (89.39/.), reference (82.65) and
inter-library loan (52%).

4.2.1 Reservation Facility

Lending Service

Lending service has been recently
computecised and the library is using bartode.
Books are issued to all members but
periodicals,
reference books,
standards,
specifications, technical reports, educational
films and photocopies are issued on restricted
basis to FM and other staff members.
Documents like annual reports, theses,
dissertations, microfilms, videos, floppies and
CD-ROMs, etc., are not issued.
Periodicals, bound, current (except latest),
and indexing and abstracting are loaned out to
FM. Students, research scholars get this facility
on limited basis (Table 8).
DESlDOC Bulletin of Inf Jechnol, 1999,19(4 & 5 )

Users' opinion on the availability of
reservation facility, for books which are already
issued to some other members, has been
analysed in Table 9 which reveals that
according to majority of users (93% FM and
77.3% students) reservation of documents
facility is provided to them.

4.2.2 Alternative Methods Adopted to
Procure the Documents

.

In the event of non-availability of the needed
documents, the users acquire them by using
different methods.
Table 10 reveals that out of all methods, self
purchasing and requesting the library for
purchase are the most frequently adopted

USEFULNESS O F SERVICES

Users' opinion on the extent of usefulness of
various reader's services has been analysed in
Table 2 1.
Data reveals that services like lending,
interlibrary loan, reference, photocopying and
to some extent bibliographical and current
awareness are regarded as useful by majority of
the users. The SDI and I/A services are not
being provided by the library, therefore, a large
majority of the users have not responded about
these services. However, a few who responded
mistakenly have probably responded on the
basis of cornmercial services acquired by the
library. Majority of FM (37.2%) have found
translation service given through the library not
useful.

6.

COMPUTER APPLICATION

The computer was introduced in the library
in 1989. Presently the IIT library possess 12 PCs
a file server (Pentium 120 Mzh-32
MB
RAM-2.4 GB hard disc) with 21 nodes and 11
printers. In addition, the library has 2 CD-ROM
work stations with CD-ROM double speed drive
and printers. IITILAN has been implemented,
thus making OPAC, accessible within and
outside the library at all times. The service
DESIDOC Bulle6n of Inf Technol, 1999,19(4 & 5 )

Contents Alert is being sent through E-mail to
FM. The library has computerised the
acquisition and processing of books and
periodicals, the circulation activities and
reference service. The library has 2 barcode
laser scanners and provided 4 terminals for
readers to access 'Mehman' i.e. Library's Online
Public Access Catalogue (OPAC). Mehman
provides access to bibliographic records of
books and bounds volume of periodicals. The
library has created a bibliographic databases for
books, bound volumes of periodicals, faculty
publications and membership records.

SUGGESTIONS

8.1

Librarian

According to the library staff, IIT libraries
have been increasingly facing acute problems of
budget. Devaluation of the rupee value,
escalating rise in cost of books and subscription
of journals, increasing needs of users,
multidisciplinary research, etc. have had an
added impact. Therefore, greater need for
Resource Sharing and Networking at local as
well as national level has been emphasised.
Exchange of content pages of journals and
supply of journals and photocopies of articles
among llTs has been suggested. i.ovision of
consultation facilities
to the members of
participating libraries has also been mentionkd.
Need for more opportunities for better
orientation
and exposure of staff towards
modern technology has been emphasised.

8.2

Users

A large number of users have suggested for
addition of more periodicals particularly those
of interdisciplinary nature. They have also
mentioned that periodicals, least in use or no
more demanded by the users to be deleted,
after seeking approval of the concerned
department and conducting a proper users'
survey. They have warned against any arbitrary
or hasty decisiorr in this regard. Need for
adopting certain cost-effective measures to
overcome the financial constraints such as
pooling of resources and co-operation among
IIT or other similar libraries has been
emphasised. Users have emphasised the need
for more funds and further suggested that no
budget cut be made from library budget
especially from the periodicals funds.
Suggestions
have
been
made
for
modernisation of library services. About

computer applications, installation of more
computer terminals within the library to
facilitate use of library facilities or services has
been stressed. Users have suggested that the
facility to access central computer from
Departments to search current literature be
provided. Need for inter linking the library
through WANILAN to access information and
also to avoid duplication of periodicals and
other costly resources has been stressed. The
same
has
now
been
implemented.
Simultaneously networking of IIT libraries on
priority basis has been sugges~ed.To cope up
with financial problems to some extent,
suggestion has been made that literature search
on computers may be done on payment basis
especially when done for outside corporate
organisations. Need for
interlinking all
important libraries in lndia and abroad via
e-mail has been emphasised. Use of electronic
devices like electronic doors or page detectors
or barcoding device to detect and check the
pilferage of documents has also been
suggested.
Need for orientation of professional staff
towards latest developments as well as
exposure to new information technological
devices has been stressed. Users have
suggested that staff must be sent to visit
important libraries in lndia and abroad to
improve upon the existing state of affairs and
also to incorporate new technological devices,
helpful to expedite the research or academic
processes. Staff must be motivated to
participate in the seminars/conferences/
lectures/ discussions, etc. So as to have proper
exposure to latest professional advancements.
They must be encouraged to improve their
qualifications, competence and efficiency by
attending various courses especially on newer
technologies and programmes organised from
time to time.
