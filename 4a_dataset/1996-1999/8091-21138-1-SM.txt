Collection Development in the Electronic Era 
Abhijeet Sudhakar Wakhare* and Abdul Jaleel T* 
Abstract 
An attempt has been made to discuss the collection development in the  Internet era with the help of some of the sources available on the Internet in  the area of pharmacology. It is argued that the Internet itself is a better tool  for accessing the collection, rather than possessing it locally. A list of sources  of information in the area of Pharmacology is also given, 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Library  is  a  social structure to serve the  community. By its definition it is  expected  to  provide  the documents to its users. Thus the  function of a library is to develop a document  collection to meet the requirements of its  clientele. But in the context  of recent  developments in IT, a mere development of  collection is meaningless because much of the  information can be accessed through various  networks and the users can be satisfied. In this  context an attempt has been made to discuss  the potentials of networks, particularly the  Internet. 
2. CHANGING ROLE OF  
LIBRARIANS 
Recent developments like Internet and the  emergence  of digital libraries have forced to  change the way the librarian functions at

present. They have to think of 'access' rather  than simply 'possession' of documents. 
Every librarian has to keep himself aware of  how  to  search  information in the networks,  besides he has to act as a  navigator/intermediary, etc. His function is not  to identify a document but to deliver the actual  information to cater to the needs of the users. 
3.  INTERNET AND COLLECTION  
DEVELOPMENT 
Internet is a network of networks providing  access  to  the  remote  databases (full text  or  bibliographic) housed elsewhere. Nobody owns  Internet It is a co-operative effort. 
Previously, it was on-line information retrieval  using remote login to a  fewer  number  of  databases pertaining to a subject domain, but  now due to Internet we can have access to a  large number of databases both bibliographical  and full text located anywhere in the world.  Apart from this some of the advantages it has  got over other media necessitates the existence  of Internet, which includes the following: 

========1========

- People of  like interest can share the  
discoveries and inventions by participating  
the 'Usenet', etc 
- Instantaneous access to the large volumes of  
textual, non-textual information, both in the  
bibliographic and full text form. 
- Cost of accessing is negligible. 
-  Repackaging of information is possible. 
There are access tools available on the  Internet with which  one  can browse for his  pertinent  information  and  can download it.  These  access tools consist of Telnet, Archie,  Gopher, Mosaic, Www, Wais, Ftp, etc. 
In almost all subjects various documents are  available  on  the Internet. In this study an  attempt has been made to give a list of  documents/ sources of information in the area  of Pharmacology. 
The following are the information sources  available  on  the  Internet  in the specialized  subject area of Pharmacology.

4. ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING 
Apart from Internet another important  development  is the availability of journals  (journal articles) in the electronic form both full  text and bibliographic, particularly in the form of  CD-ROMS. If such CD-ROMS are available in  the networks, many can access such CDs and  select their relevant articles of interest. Then  why subscription of journals? 
The factors that economy and technology  have brought problem and paradoxes  in the  library and information provision. 
Some of the merits of electronic publishing  are: 
- Publication can be more timely.   
- Can be more readily accessed. Do not  
need to be bound/shelved. 
- Missing issues and missing pages do not need to     
   be replaced. 
Digitizing of information do help a great  deal. However there are problems for handling  and using this large volumes of digitized  information, for instance: 
- Browsing on the electronic form is  
difficult when compared to printed form. 
- Remote access to documents are  
uncomfortable to spot access. 
- Disappearance of nascent information on  
the Internet. 
- Some documents are used only when it is  
seen. 
- Inadequacy of the libraries to predict the  
future use of documents, irrespective of the  
form (printed/electronic).

- Navigating (locating) the information on the  
Internet. 
- Problems of intellectual property rights of  
the author and publisher, etc 
Under these circumstances, especially labs  like  CSIR, DRDO, etc., can think of certain  alternatives like co-operative  resource  management sharing of resources, etc, in the  networked era. 
5. CONCLUSION 
In the context of networks, there is a need to  think of information resources development  rather than collection development. Well  defined policy should be  formulated  in  the  present  situation to meet the information  hungry and impatient users. Nevertheless the  librarian should provide services  which should  encompass and enriches the potentials of the  Internet.
