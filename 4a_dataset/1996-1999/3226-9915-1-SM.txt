INTRODUCTION

The library of ATIRA (Ahmedabad Textile
Industry's Research Association) was the first in
lndia to start industry oriented documenfation
services in early 1960. These services were
provided primarily to the member textile mills
and to the staff of ATIRA. Realising the
importance of information services to the lndian
textile industry, a proposal was mooted in 1965
for the establishment of a 'Centralised
Information System for the lndian Textile
Industry'. However, shortage of funds prevented
ATlRA from taking any concrete step. In 1987, a
proposal for the establishment of the NICTAS
(National Information Centre for Textile and
Allied Subjects) was approved by NlSSAT
(National Information System for Science and
Technologyj.
Two of the prime objectives of NICTAS are:

(1) To develop resources o i information
appropriate to the needs of the lndian users
of textile information.

(2) To integrate and coordinate the existing and
future scientific and technical information
systems and services, related to textile and
allied subjects, into an organised and effective
network, with voluntary cooperation of
different scientific and technical agencies in
the country, and also estabfishinglinkage with
textile and allied subjects information centres
outside India.
ATIRA library used to publish, since 1963
the Cu~rentTextile Literature with abstracts that
was supplied to its member industries free of
charge. This service was discontinued in 1980
because of its limited utility as an economy
measure.
ATIRA did a survey of the information needs
of the textile industry in lndia in 1980. A
detailed report of over 200 pages was
published. The survey established the following
conclusions:
A vast quantum of information i s available
but that i s not being utilised due to the
following reasons:

e It is not easily accessible to all interested in
India.

P A large portion of it i s not related to the lndian

context.

+

It misses out on much lndian information, and

+

It is expensive to acquire.

In view of the above findings, when NICTAS
was established, it was decided to develop a
database and publish a journal containing self
explanatory
summaries
of
articles,
developments, books, standards, etc., useful to
identify user groups of lndia and in other
developing countries in the field of textile and
allied subjects.

2.

DEVELOPMENTAL EFFORTS

Before starting the development of the
database, following actions/decisions were
taken.

2.1

Brain Storming Session

A brain storming session was arranged in
ATIRA,
where
many
textile
scientists,
technologists and others actively participated
and various useful suggestions were received.
Contents of the databases were discussed in
detail.

2.2

Naming Contest

What is in a 'name'? but in this world
everything is known by 'name'. Hence, a well
designed colaurful poster was prepared and
copies were sent to all Indian textile R & 0 and
teaching institutions in India. All were
requested to suggest a suitable name and a
symbot as per the description given in the
poster. An award was announced for the
winning entries. Over 450 names were
suggested by more than 75 persons from all
parts of India. The naming context committee
finally selected the name TEXINCON (TEXtile
INformation CONdensed}.

2.3 Guidelines for Preparing
Summaries
Clear cut guidelines and instructions were
prepared for preparing summaries of articles,
books, standards, developments, etc. This
helped in bringing uniformity in the context of
summaries.

2.4

Help of Subject Specialists

In order to have more purposeful and self
contained summaries, it was decided to entrust
this task only to subject specialists. This was an
unique experiment on cooperative inputting. At
present over 90 senior professors scientists and
technologists from over 26 R&D and teaching
institutions in lndia are helping NICTAS in
preparing summaries for TEXINCON. Only a
token honorarium is paid and a TEXINCON copy
is supplied free to the participating institutions.
The uninterrupted smooth working of this
system over 9 years shows that this unique
experiment has indeed been very successful.

2.5

Identification of User Groups

The following TEXINCON user groups were
identified. The carefully designed contents of
TEXINCON ensure that all user groups would
find some information of their own use in some
context in each issue.
TEXINCON user groups (Beneficiaries of
TEXINCON), in alphabetical order, are listed
here:

Key-word lndex

Based on above decisions, the first issue of
TEXINCON was prepared and was released by
Dr Abid Hussain, Member of the Planning
Commission, on February 9, 1989 during the
30th joint Technological Conference held at
ATIRA, Ahmedabad. This conference was
attended by over 900 technologists and
managers from the textile industry, covering all
textile centres in India.

Advertisements of products useful to lndian
textile and allied industries

User Groups and User Group lndex is a
speciality of TEXINCON. This has been highly
appreciated by users. No other journal
(Database) in the world gives User Groups
Index.
It was decided that TEXINCON shoufd cover
informations published on 'all fibres' in the
areas: production and properties; yarn forming;
fabric forming; chemical and finishing
processes; products; manufacture, properties
and aftercare; designing and fashions; analysis,
testing and quality control; mill engineering
(including energy); environment protection;
management; and generalities.

2.7

Back-up services

The following decisions were also taken:

a Full text of any article summarised in
TEXlNCON should be supplied within two
working days and can be supplied by Regd.
Post. For this purpose the TEXINCON
photocopy coupons should be made
available.

+

Well planned marketing efforts must be
undertaken.

Birth of TEXINCON

MANACINCTEXIN"CON

In order to maintain high quality and utility a
series of steps are taken. These refer to
managing each of the three aspects of work
(1) Selection of contents (2) production and
despatch, and (3) after sakervices.

3.1

Lead Article

NlCTAS invites, well in advance, prominent
experts from all over the world to write the lead
articles. Each author has to fo(low strictly the
guidelines provided by NICTAS. Indian authors
are paid an honorarium of Rs 500 and foreign
authors are given free TEXlNCON copy for one
year.
The manuscript received from the author is
sent to some experts for editing and
modifications, if any. If major modifications are
needed, the modified version is sent back to the
author for approval/change.

In this context, it may be mentioned that
TEXINCON also indudes the results of a
comprehensive literature search on the subject
of the lead article.

3.2

Advertisements from Industry

For financial sustenance, TEXINCON accepts
advertisements from textiles and related
companies.

3.3

Summary Preparation

Selection is made keeping in view only one
objective-any scientific and technical literature
or development useful to one or more identified
User Groups in lndia and other developing
countries.
Articles, books, developments are selected
from over 400 periodicals, received in 20
institutions. Each institution has been allotted
specific titles of journals to avoid duplication.
Photocopies of selected articles are also sent
directly to subject specialists for preparing
summaries.
Summaries of books are done by subject
specialists from the books received in their
libraries as per selection guidelines.
Useful developments are identified by
NICTAS and their summaries are prepared.
Summaries of developments in textile research
institutes in lndia are also included.

3.4

Spotlight

To cope for the benefit of TEXINCON
readers, NICTAS started a new service from
April 1993, called SPOTLIGHT. It addition to the
citation details and summaries, titles of selected
publications on current subjects such as denims,
I S 0 9000, jute and environment of current
interest is included in each issue of TEXINCON.
Each issue lists 50 such articles.

3.5

Computer Check for Duplication

All summaries are checked to avoid
duplication, within a issue or from past
issues.

3.6

Collection Management

Each of the 26 collaborating R & Dlteaching
institutions has a 'Coordinator' working for
NICTAS. Coordinator of each institution collects
summaries prepared by subject specialists of
his/her institution and sends these once in a

month by registered post to Coordinator,
NICTAS.
An honorarium of Rs 20 per summary is
given to the person who prepares summary
and Rs 2 per summary is given to the person
who coordinates the work in an institute.
Payment to summary writers and coordinators
is made as soon as the issue of TEXINCON is
published.
All participating organisations get TEXINCON
free of charge.

3.7

Editing and Checking

All summaries are very carefully edited and
chesked for:

a Language

a
a

Technical content
Complete bibliographical details as per the
NICTAS approved standard format.

After necessary corrections, summaries are
passed on for allotting keywords, identifying
user groups. After arranging under the 11
subject headings, each summary is given a
unique summary number. All summaries are
arranged according to this number. Thereafter,
two indexes viz., keyword index and user group
index, are prepared.

3.8

CONCLUSION

TEXINCON is an ideal example of how a
bibliographic database product could make a
mark in the impoverished information market in
India. This mainly owes to the quality and
punctuality maintenance and responsiveness to
users requirements-these have come about
through preparations from the design stage
itself. The success has also been reinforced

through astute marketing
aftersales support.
