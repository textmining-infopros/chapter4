services to its usen.

1. INTRODUCTION
Info~mationtechnology (IT) that will shape
the future information world is the fusion of
computers
and
telecommunications
technologies. Computers process information
and telecommunication rechnoiogy disseminate
information. Development of more powerful
computers with new methods of information
processin& computer networks, and integrated
communication systems are of great relevance
to the 21st century as these are basic and
important information technologies responsible
to bring drastic changes in our so called
information society of tomorrow. If we look
back in the history we find the roots of today's
information technology. Improvements in the
efficiency of information management has felt
long back since the start of the intelligent life of
mankind and has led to incredible innovations.
Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone,
~harfes Babbage invented . a machine that
eventually developed into today's computer and
William Burt invented the typewriter. Bell,
Babbage and Burt invented indigenous
' machines to
improve the management of
information.
They were the pioneers of
telecommunications, data processing and office

automation. These inventions are the basis of
today's IT.
lnformation technology has a wider meaning
for information specialists which include in
addition technologies like, repro-micrographic
technology,
technical
communication
technologies, and database creation and use.
As IT plays a major role in the management of
information, by the application of it the modern
technological developments are being exploited
to record, process, store, transfer and retrieve
the information. We are operating in an
environment in which innovative use of
information technology in organisations in
general bas led to the creation of new products,
improved services and dramatically reduced
computer costs. IT is playing a major role in
transforming our institutions particularly our
libraries to match the information needs of the
users of next millennium.

2. FEATURES OF AN IT
ENVIRONMENT
Inform%tion, an intangible resource, is used'
by decision-makers, planners and managers as a
power to manage other tangible resources i.e.
17

man, material and money. Access to relevant
information has always been important to those
who influence their world consistently and
successfully. Today the whole world is divided
into two conceptual categories-Information
rich and information poor nations. Only
information rich are considered powerful and
leaders of the society. lnformation is a vi&l
resource which acts as a driving force for
technological as well as societal development
of any nation. A nation which is rich in
information is rich in socio-economic spheres.
T'ne backw, tdness of any -2untry in respect of
socio-economic spheres is mainly due to lack of
adequate information especially in the field of
science and technology. Scientific and
technological information made the greatest
impact in the post4ndustrial society and
contributed a great deal for research and
development. Advanced nations pay great
attention to support research and development
activities of their industries and institutions.
They use the information as a power to lead the
society in all spheres of mankind. Following are
some of the key features of an IT environment.

n lnformation acts as a key resource. A typical
IT industry treats information as a
commodity and involves economics of
information, viz., production, costing and
marketing.

n In an IT environment, information play a
vital role as a fourth managerial asset after
people, equipment and capital.

.n Information, a conceptual resource, is used
to manage other physical resources thus
acts as power.

n Revolutionary change in the technology is
the driving force of an IT environment.

n The .pace of change in technology has been
speeding up which shrunk the time scales
from one hundred generations for the
agrarian revolution, ten for the indudtrial
revolution, to only one for the information
revolution.

n IT moves very fast and brings incredible
turbulence, change and progress in the lives
of individuals, orgatiisations, nations and
regions.
18

n IT also ,transforms international politics and
socio-economic relations and presents the
world with new market opportunities.

information, alternative to online access to
external databases. The drastic change in
information technology has transformed the
work culture in special libraries and brought
new responsibilities to librarians. They should
be prepared for the adoption and absorption of
new technologies in their work environment.
The exciting growth of the internet in recent
years has further changed and intensified the
role of the information specialist in electronic
environment. The growth of the lnternet
inspired many libraries to make documents and
resources from their collections available online
to the public as well as worldwide. Library and
communit)r
information
services,
local
information, 'bibliographic databases, and
electronic reference works were all made
available through remote login. A library's status
was no longer solely defined by the collection
it housed; it was extended to include
online resources which were easily available
to remote users.

-

As more and more information became
available, because institutions were increasingly
competing to demonstrate who had made
available the most comprehensive range of
information, there was little order to it. In early
days of lnternet it was difficult to find relevant
information from such a huge ocean of
unstructured knowledge. Later on, the plethora
of information available on the lnternet became
more accessible with the help of various
searching and indexing tools. Early tools, such
as gopher, and veronica helped to give some
order to the chaos. Now the lnternet is most
frequently used for reading and sending
electronic mail (e-mail), transferring files (file
transfer protocol), remote login through
TELNET, and searching the world wide web
(WWW). File Transfer Protocol (FTP). allow users
to import and transmit file.. TELNET, or remote
login, allow individuals to tap information
acailable on remote computers. The WWW and
various web browsers, such as Netscape
Navigator and Microsoft lnternet Explorer,
along with new searching tools, comprised the
next generation of lnternet resources. All these
developments call for developing new skills to
access information with new searching tools.
Navigating the lnternet using tools such as
TELNET, FTP and WWW is becoming a part of

the librarian's responsibility. The developments
in the IT is motivating today's libraries or
information centres to move from technical
services to access services. Special libraries in

recognises collaboration, resource-sharing and
the ability to' bring libraries to their user as
points of key concern.
The changing function and dimensions of
the library and information work will direct the
role and future of- the librarian of a special
library or information unit. The new network
environment has
created
an
active,
service-oriented approach of libraries, which
requires dynamic, organisational, personnel and
technological changes in the profession.
Following are some of the areas of key
concern of a special library where librarian can
play vital role to keep pace with the changing IT
environment.

The responsibilities of these new jobs call for
the previous duties. plus acquiring skills to
handle and manage with the latest
technological development happening now and
in near future. To explo e the various uses of IT
't
in a special library environment, latest facilities
available and services offered by Defence
Science Library (DSL) has been discussed in
detail as an example of special library. Following
portion of this paper gives an indepth
information regarding impact of IT on various
areas of DSL activities.

4. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
SCENARIO AT DEFENCE
SCIENCE LIBRARY
Defence Science Library (DSL), the central
library of DRDO, is housed in a modern
ti-storied building (covering an 'area of over
29,000 sq. ft), with all the necessary
infrastructure and aesthetic environment
conducive for serious study, functions at
DESIDOC. Catering to the information needs of
researchers, managers and decision-makers in
the areas of defence science and technology,
library is moving strategically towards a more
digital culture. Development,in technology has
been an important driving force for such a
change.
Matching
with
the
technological
advancements, DSL is one of the best equipped
libraries in the country in the field of science
and technology and has the largest collection of
documents in the field of defence science and
technology. Library collection is a balanced mix
of all types of storage media e.g. paper, micro,
optical and electronic. DSL provides a variety of
information services to its users to fulfil their
day-today as weU as exhaustive information
needs using a complete range of information
resources starting from conventional paper
media, traditional online searching to latest
electronic and optical media and world wide
web and internet
Following are some of the areas of library
activities where DSL is- effectively making use of
the latest advancements of IT and able to
perform better by providing its users a modern,
20

technologically competitive library, which fulfils
their information needs with more satisfaction.

4.1 Collection Development
Defence Science Library has the largest
collection of documents on Defence S&T in the
country. With the advancement of technology,
DSL has also changed its procurement policies:
The benefits like fast and easy access to
information in less occupied space offered by
the new information storage technologies in the
form of electronic and optical media has
attracted the attention of library management
Now anart from printed version of publications
in various fields of science and technology, DSL
has also built up an excellent collection of
non-print media such as optical and electronic
formats which includes a large number of
CD-ROM databases and access to electronic
periodicals through internet.
As on 01 November i999 its collection of
over 2.5 lakh documents includes over 66,968
books, 99,630 technical reports (including
micro documents ) 54,000 standards and
specifications, and 48,835 back volumes of
periodicals. It subscribes to 45 periodicals in
electronic format and possesses 42 titles of
bibliographic/full text databases in CD-ROM
format covering almost all areas of defence
science and technology.

4.2 Computerisation of Library
House Keeping Operations
Computers have made forays into the
libraries world over. Almost all the operations
a library can be computerised to achieve mo
efficient functioning. DSL has computeri
various house-keeping and managem
functions of the library, viz. acquisition, seria
control, circulation and budgetary control usin
an integrated software package calle
SUCHIKA, which is designed to run on a variety
of platforms. To meet the computerisation
requirements of library, DSL started automating
its house-keeping operations using DOS a
Unix versions of the SUCHIKA softwa
Though the software is able to fulfil the basic
requirements of a good integrated libra
management system, the need for an improve
version was felt with the growing technologica

advancements.
Factors
like
recent
advancements in IT industry (hardware as well
as software), a shift in the computer operating
environment from DOS to Windows with
added facilities of handling, processing and
accessing information, and growing networking
environments has prompted DSL to take
initiatives to switch over to an improved version
of SUCHIKA which can operate in Windows
NT environments. This improved version is a
fully integrated multi user sofhkare which uses
common communication format (CCF) for data
structuring to facilitate resource sharing among
other libraries.

DSL Holdings

4.3 Database Creation Activities

4.3.2 For DRDO Holdings

Computerised databases help in collection
of data and its efficient retrieval. DSL has
developed good expertise in the design and
development of databases. It has made
successful effoits to develop bibliographic
databases for the holdings of DSL and other
DRDO libraries separately by converting the
records of books, reports, conference
proceedings and other serial publications into
machine readable form and made them
available for searching in the form of Online
Public Access Catalogues.

DSL has alsd d w e k p ~ dan OPAC of the
holdings of about 37 DRDO libraries including
DSL and consist of more than 2 lakh records of
books, reports, conference proceedings etc.
Inputs to this database are provided by the
DRDO libraries on the b&is of CCF. The OPAC
can be searched online through I-Net, dial-up
mode and internet (TELNA) from distant
locations. To harness the advantages of the
CD-ROM like high storage capacity, portability
and ease of use, this data is also made available
on CD-ROM format for those labdratories
where the internet facility is not provided.

Also, a database for Union Catalogue of
periodicals of DRDO libraries has been
developed at DSL All the three databases are
designed using the state of the art information
technology tods. All these databases are
available on a variety of platforms, like online,
CD-ROM, etc.
Both services offer an excellent collection of
business information, including news, industry
analysis, and market research. Both also provide
wide-ranging coverage of biomedicine,
pharmaceuticals, and heaith care, including
medical and pharmaceutical research, drug data
and toxicology, and health care administration,
In addition, DIALOG is known for its excellent
collection of intellectual property data, and
Datastar for its excellent coverage of
pharmaceuticals and of European companies,
industries, and news.

DESlOOC Bulletin d lnf T d n o l , 1999,19(6)

An online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC);
a computerised database of the holdings of
DSL, has been developed. As on 01 August
1999 the 'database covers the bibliographic
details of 96 thousand books, technical reports,.
conference proceedings etc. held by the library
and can be searched by various access points
like author/editor, accession number, keyword
(descriptors), International Standard Book
Number (ISBN) or report number. It can also
be searched by outstation users over a
telephoneline.

4.3.3 Union Catalogue of Periodicals in
DRDO Libraries
DSL has prepared a Union Catalogue of
periodicals of DRDO libraries. Presently, data
from 40 DRDO libraries has. already 'been
covered. A CD-version of Union catalogue for
periodicals consisting of 7000 records is under
preparation.

In DSL, the availability of above mentioned
electronic resources in the form of CD-ROMs,
electronic journals, online OPACsl, and other
internet based resources has changed the
traditional

links
between
professionals, information, and patrons.

4.6 Resource Sharing
An important issue of concern to librarians
in today's world of so called information rich
society i s to have access to even those
information resources which are not available in
house. This need arose due to the fact that
however rich in its collections a library can not
become self sufficient to meet the growing
information requirements of its users in house.
Also with the changing technological
advancements the shift is towards access
services. This means emphasis is on what your
library can access rather what your library
possess. Another point of key concern is rising
costs of documents and their phenomenal
growth in each subject. All these issues point
out towards explor~ngthe possibilities to share
our resources with other libraries and
information centres and also, to have access to
their resources.
DSL extends its facilities and services to
DRDO as well as to non-DRDO users by
sharing its experience and resources with other
libraries and iriformation centres. DSL had
organised a one day meeting of the heads of
major Indian S&T libraries and information
systems at Metcalfe House, Delhi, on 14
October 1998. The main objectives of the
meeting were to strengthen co-operation
amongst major S&T libraries in India for optimal
utilisation of information resources using e-mail,
online
and
other
faster
means
of
communication; to explore the possibilities of
inter-linking these libraries through a network
for resource sharing; and to accelerate
bibliographic database development activities.
DSL actively participates in the network
programs like DELNET and 1NFLlBNET and
played a vital role in the development of these
networks. The purpose of networking is to
establish a set up for sharing the resources.
DESlDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 1999,19(6)

DESIDOC has a well setup local area network
(LAN) environment with multi platform
operating systems. It has adopted STAR
topology to setup its network environment
using ETHERNET LAN CARD'S with UTP
(Unshielded Twisted Pair) CAT 5 (Category 5)
cable. DSL is making the efficient use of this
LAN facility. By putting it's library holdings and
peripherals on network it became possible to
provide OPAC facilities to the DESIDOC staff at
their desk (i.e. searching documents, reserving
docuntents, etc:) and sharing the peripherals
available in DSL with other divisions. A 24 port
intelligent hub is provided for concatenating all
the systems for faster communications. On this
backbone, the following three servers are
installed.

x Novel Server: To share the various
applications programs and software among
different users (e.g. MS Office, DTP
software. etc.)

n

Unix Server: To search the DRDO holdings
database which can be accessed through
Internet (IP address 202.54.26.39) or in
dial-up mode (01 1-3982617) or through the
DRDO homepage (www.drdo.com)

n Windows
'

NT Server: Proxy server
connected to Videsh Sanchar Nigam
Limited (VSNL) through 64 kbps lease line
to provide internet facility to the users at
their respective desks.

5. CONCLUSION
Information centre or library is the heart and
soul of an IT industry. IT that will shape the
future information world and considered to be
a new wealth creator, offers immense
opportunities for librarians. Use of IT in a
special library environment like DSL, has been
able to improve the overall library management
activities. and able to enhance the library
services, both qualitatively as well as
quantitatively. In order to draw maximum
benefits from latest developments in IT, DSL has
been able to create an environment where IT
can grow and flourish so that its full potential
can be harvested by its ultimate users. With the
use of latest technologies DSL has been able to
provide its users fast and efficient access to a
variety of information resources with maximum
25

user'satisfaction and able to achieve its very
basic goal of providing right information to the
right user at the right time.
DSL is continuously in the process of
transforming into more electronic culture and
trying to cope up with the latest technological
dwelopm:nts.
But, as the technology is
changing at a very fast rate, there is still scope
for the librarian and others involved in library
activities to develop more skills and have
matching human resources to keep pace Mtt~
this
changing
information
technology
environment.
