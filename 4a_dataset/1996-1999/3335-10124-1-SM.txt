DESIDOC in Pursuit of Excellence
1.

INTRODUCTION

The Defence Scientific lnformation and
Documentation Centre (DESIDOC) is very
well-known as a central source of S&T
information for the Defence Research &
Development Organisation (DRDO) which has
over 50 R&D laboratories located at different
places in the country. DESIDOC is one of the
DRDO laboratories or establishments which is
meant for collecting and disseminating S&T
information of interest and relevant to DRDO
scientists and technologists. The functions of
DESIDOC are therefore organised to meet this
marrdate.
DESIDOC started functioning in 1958 and it
was then known as Scientific lnformation
Bureau. It was one of the divisions of the
Defence Science Laboratory (DSL), a major

laboratory of DRDO. As the activities of DRDO
increased and expanded, the activities of
DESIDOC also increased correspondingly. In
1967 it was renamed as Defence Scientific
lnformation and Documentation Centre with
expanded charter of duties. The details of the
functions of DESIDOC carried out as per the
present chartel- of duties are given in the
following sections. '

1.1

The Hierarchical Position

As is well known, the Ministry of Defence in
the Government of India has three departments,
each headed by a Secretary to the Government
of India. Its organisational hierarchy and the
position of DESIDOC are shown in Fig.1.
The figure however does not show the
hierarchy in terms of protocol among the chiefs

the Navy) and the secretaries of the
departments and other senior officials, but only
shows the administrative structure of the
Ministry and the position of DESIDOC in the
Ministry. Since the Centre is a part of the
Defence Ministry, it also extends its services to
the defence agencies other than those of
DRDO. In other words, DESIDOC serves mainly
the DRDO agencies and extends some of its
services to the other defence agencies in the
country.

2.

The organisational structure of DESIDOC
underwent modifications from time to time to
meet the changing information requirements of
DRDO in terms of subject areas, extent of
coverage, speed of supply, etc. But these
changes were always within the framework of its
charter of duties which cover collection,
processing and 'dissemination
of
SAT
information. The functions of DESIDOC are
organised into various divisions and groups as
given in Fig. 2.

Service to Non-Defence
agencies

1.3

ORGANISATIONAL
STRUCTURE

While concentrating its efforts to meet the
S&T information requirements of DRDO in
particular and the Ministr;y of Defence in
general, DESIDOC was also extending, till 1992,
its services to other nondefence agencies or
organisations on reciprocal basis. However,
since January 1993, DESIDOC has opened its
services to any individual agency or
organisation against payment, subject to its
convenience. Since the Centre has a very rich
information base in its library and has expertise,
skills and capabilities in several areas of
information processing and dissemination, the
demand on its services can be quite huge and
varied. So, the policy of DESIDOC is to
endeavour to serve nondefence requests also

3.

DIVISIONS AND THEIR
FUNCTIONS

The Divisions of DESIDOC are organ'ised
according to broad areas of activity and .by
grouping similar functions together.

3.1

Defence Science Library (DSL)

The DSL is a main Division of DESIDOC
forming the basis for most of its activities. Most
of the information dissemination activities and
services of the Centre, like the current
awareness and selective dissemination of
information (SDI) services, are based on the

information received in DSL in the form of
books, journals, reports, patents, standard
specifications, CD-ROM databases, video and
audio tapes, etc Since defence R&D is normally
carried out on current or latest technologies, the
documents or publications procurred by the
DSL are mostly foreign, in addition to the R&D
reports generated in India that are of relevance
to or have application in defence. Also, the
growth of collection of the Library has been
gradual and in tune with the demands of DRDO
scientists and technologists. Many of these
publications are highly specialised and
value-added,
like
analysis
reports
on
defence-related technologies. Since such
publications are quite expensive, the number of
publications added every year increases only
gradually even though the budget allocation for
the acquisitions is quite substantial. The present
collection of DSL and the budget allocation are
given in Table 1.

Allocation only for purchase of reading materials
& does not include other expenses on furniture,

equipment, staff, accomodation, etc.
Since DSL has to acquire more of technical
reports, specialised monographs, abstracting
and indexing periodicals and other research
journals than books, the acquisitions also reflect
such priorities. Table 2 gives the collection in
terms of different types of publications or
documents.
DSL acquires a number of CD-ROM
databases which are used by the concerned
groups for providing reference service, CAS and
SDI services. The reference service is also
strengthened by an impressive collection of
reference tools. The list of CD-ROM databases
acquired by DSL and a list of selected reference
tools available are given in Annexures A & B
respectively. In addition to the usual functions of
DESIDOC Bulktin of Inf Technol, 16(3), 1997

the library like acquisition, circulation, serials
control and reference service, the DSL carries
out the following functions :

3.1.1 Database Development
The DSL maintains a database of its holdings
of books and reports in computerised form
using an in-house software called SUCHIKA.
Data for this database is collected in the
Common Communication
Format (CCF)
promoted by Unesco. This database is available
as onfine public access catalogue (OPAC) which
can be accessed from the terminals kept in the
library and also through telephone lines in
dial-up mode. .It contains presently about
92,000 records.
In addition to this database of DSL holdings,
a database of the holdings of books and reports
of all the DRDO libraries excluding those of
DESIDOC (about 45 IibrariesfllCs) is also being
developed. For this data is received from the
DRDO libraries and TICS and then converted
into a computerised form. This DRDO holdings
database (of books & reports) presently has
about 55,000 records.
Another database covering the periodical
holdings of DRDO libraries is also maintained in
a computerised form. Shortly, all these
databases will be made available for online
access from distant locations also, in dialup
mode or through the I-Net (a packet switching
network provided by the Department of
Telecommunications, Government of India).

3.1.2 Knight-Ridder (DIALOG) Service
Majority of the requests for information are
served from the holdings of the DSL. However,
for current and exhaustive searches from

databases which are not received in CDROM,
:'the library searches the knight Ridder (formerly
known as DIALOG lnformation Service)
databases;

3.1.3 Manual of Library Procedures
The libraries in the DRDO laboratories
located at various places in the country, were
following procedures which differed in some
aspects from those of others. Such differences
were mainly in the activities of acquisition,
circulation, serials control and financial
management. So, in order to make these
procedures uniform so that a single library
automation software would serve all the libraries
and also for pooling up and exchanging of
holdings information, DESIDOC has evolved, in
collaboration with other DRDO libraries, a set
of uniform library procedures. A manual
covering these common procedures has been
issued as a departmental document by the
DRDO headquarters for use by all the libraries
in the Organisation. This manual is titled,
'Procedure Manual for Libraries and Technical
lnformation Centre.'

3.1.4 Development of Library
Management Software
For automating the functions and services of
the DSL and also to help automation of those of
other DRDO libraries, DSL has got a developed
softdare called SUCHIKA. This is an integrated
software which is applicable for computerising
all the library functions and for providing online
catalogue. The software has been developed in
C++ and is available both in DOS and UNlX
versions. This is available to non-DRDO
libraries/organisations also on payment.
The software developed earlier before the
SUCHIKA was called DELMS which was
implemented in DSL and was also distributed to
some other DRDO libraries and to the
INFLIBNET Program of the University Grants
Commission.

lnformation Centre (TIC) functions at the DRDO
Headquarters. This serves as an extension
counter of DSL and the publications to be
issued to the members of the Headquarters are
done so through this unit. Also, the unit receives
and displays about 80 current periodicals (other
than those received -in DSL) and maintains a
small reference and other book collection for
meeting the immediate and day-today reference
requirements of the Headquarters. Old issues of
periodicals are transferred to DSL for retention.

3.1.6 Resource Sharing with other
Libraries
DSL . participates . in resource sharing
programmes with other libraries particularly the
major S&T libraries in New Delhi. It supplies
contents pages of selected journals required by
the participating libraries and. also receives the
ones required by its users. In addition, it actively
participates in the DELNET program.

3.2

lnformation Services Division

DESIDOC constantly endeavours to bring to
the notice of DRDO scientists the information
received in DSL. In other words, it makes efforts
to take the library to its users. This is done by
providing exhaustive and regular CAS and SDI
services. Since it would require considerable
efforts to take the vast information received to a
large number of scientists, a separate Division
called lnformation Services Division (ISD) is
formed for the purpose. This Division is
committed to beam the incurring information to
the scientists of the corresponding subject
disciplines. Thus, while the DSL provides
information against specific queries (reference
service), i.e. information service on demand, the
ISD provides anticipatory information services
like CAS and SDI. Towards this the Division
provides the following services.

3.1.5 DSL Extension Unit at DRDO
Headquarters

3.2.1 Defence Technology Alerts (DTA):
A Weekly Current Awareness
Service

While the library support to the DRDO
Headquarters is mostly provided by DSL, an
extensive unit of DSL called the Technical

About 60 military journals are regularly
scanned for collecting information relevant to
DRDO. Abstracts of such articles/papers are
DESlDOC Bulletin of lnf Technol, 16(3), 1997

prepared and arranged under different subject
groupings is brought out as the DTA. Printed
copies of the DTA are mailed to about 500
project groups and individual scientists in
DRDO and other agencies of the Ministry of
Defence.

3.2.2 Selective Dissemination of
Information (SDI)
Out of the 23 CD-ROM bibliographic
databases received in DSL, about half a dozen
are selected based on demand, and these are
matched by computer with about 500 subject
interest profiles of project groups and individual
users of DRDO for generally SDI reports and
the matched outputs are mailed to the
respective users once a month. A mechanism of
feedback from the users is built into the
operation of the service through which the
Division regularly receives feedback from the
users on the relevance of the items included in
the SDI outputs. Since the SDI service provides
mostly titles and/or abstracts of relevant papers
or publications, the users frequently request for
full texts of some of the SDI items. DESIDOC
expects the libraries or TICS of the respective
laboratories to provide such document delivery
service. In case a DRDO library is unable or
finds it 'difficult to provide full texts of the
documents, DSL also makes efforts to provide
document delivery service to DRDO scientists.
This work often necessitates acquiring copies of
articles from other libraries while this is done for
DRDO demands, non-DRDO requests for
document supply is done only when the
requested document is available in DSL.

3.2.3 Newspaper Clippings Service (NCS)
Over 16 newspapers are daily scanned and
news items and articles of -Defence interest and
also those of interest to scientists is general, are
collected and included in this daily service
which is sent daily to the top mbnagement at
DRDO HQrs. In addition to selected
newspapers, important news items and articles
are collected from a few magazines like India
Today, Front Line, Sunday, New Scientist, etc
and included in this service. About 35 top and
senior .officials in DRDO receive this service
daily.
DESlDOC Bulletin of lnf Technol, 16(3), 1 997

3.2.4 Forthcoming Conferences
This is a quarterly awareness service giving
details of forthcoming conferences, seminars
and symposia of potential interest to DRDO
scientists. While scientists use such information
for presenting papers at such events, libraries
use it for acquiring the proceedings of interest
to their laboratories. About 500 scientists and
project groups receive this information.

3.2.5 Translation Services
Since nearly half of world's S&T literature
output is in languages other than English,
DESIDOC, right from its initial stages, has been
providing translation services to DRDO
scientists from languages like Chinese, French,
German, Japanese, Russian, etc. While the
Centre has a few staff for some of these
languages, it maintains panels of translators from
other organisations and individuals to cope up
with the demand from the DRDO scientists for
translations. The number of pages of original
text in diffe'rent foreign languages translated
during the year 1996 was about 2,000 pages.

3.2.6 Database Development
Computerised databases covering the items
selected for CAS and SDI services will .be
developed and maintained shortly. A database
of the translations done so far by DESIDOC is
already available as 'Translation Bank'.

3.2.7 International Directory of Defence
Related Institutions & Industries
The ISD initially collected a large number of
addresses for compiling mailing lists for Centre.
This was subsequently augumented further and
a directory of in2titutions and industries in
various countries engaged in defence-related
activities, both in the public and private sectors,
was compiled. This has then been published
under the Special Publications Series of
DESIDOC. Most of the information in the
Directory was
included
after
getting
authenticated and updated by the respective
organisations.

3.3 DRDO Publications
DESIDOC also acts as the publication wing
of DRDO. On behalf of the Organisation i t

Copyright Problems in Library Services (Guest
Editor: Dr NR Madhava Menon)

publishes a number of periodicals and other
bpecial publications.

3.3.1 Defence Science journal (DSI)
This is a quarterly research periodical of
DRDO which publishes original research papers
having application to defence and critical
reviews on topics of defence science. It also
includes short communications. The pwers
contributed to the journal are refereed by
experts in the field and its policies and
procedures are guided by an Editorial Advisory
Board and an Editorial Executive Committee
both comprising eminent experts in different
disciplines related to Defence. Every issue of
DSj is usually a special issue on a specific topic
and an eminent scientist in the field is
associated with it as a Guest Editor. The Journal
is a priced publication and is abstracted in about
a dozen international abstractinuindexing
periodicals.

3.3.2 Technology Focus (TF)
This is bi-monthly petiodical focussing on the
technologies developed by DRDO. Since many
of these technologies have applications in the
civilian sector also, TF is well received not only
by defence agencies in various countries but
also nondefence agencies both in the public
and private sectors.

3.3.3 DESIDOC Bulletin of Information

Technology (DBIT)
The DBIT is a bi-monthly which endeavours
to bring the current developments in library and
information technology to its readers. It

These are monthly house bulletins of DRDO.
They present the manifold activities of the
DRDO laboratories and establishments. Besides
reporting technical developments, they cover
topics such as personnel news, academic and
cultural activities, visits of VIPs and so on. The
main objective of these publications is to bridge
the communication gap among various levels of
management and other staff. The English version
of the newsletter is called DRDO Newsletter
and the Hindi version is called 'DRDO
Samachar'.

3.3.5 DRDO Monographs

This is a monthly house bulletin of DESIDOC
which announces the scientific dwelopments in
the Centre, the staff news, etc. This is supplied
free of charge to libraries and information
centres in DRDO in other organisations.

3.4

Human Resource Development

Information science and technology is
developing very fast and the library and
information specialists must keep themselves
abreast with those developments for making
effective use of them in constantly improving
their services. Towaids this end, the Human
Resource Development Division of DESIDOC
conducts refresher courses and other training
program in the areas of library and information
science and technology. Although these are
mainly meant for the DROO personnel, suitable
candidates from other organisations are also
accepted on a nominal fee. Several courses on
indexing, online searching, Internet, Effective
communication, Library Automation, Database
Development, etc have so far been conducted.
Such and other relevant courses will also be
conducted every year.
The Division also arranges for the visit of
BLlSc and MLlSc students from various
universities to the various Divisions of DESIDOC
when they visit on study tours.

3.4.1 Consultancy
DESIDOC
endeavours
to
provide
consultancy to other organisations in the
establishment of libraries and technical
information centres,
and
in
database
development, library automation, online and
lnternet searching, reprography, multimedia
dwelopment, etc. Some of the organisations to
which consultancy services were provided
include Nehru Memorial Museum Library,
NISSAT, and Consultancy Development Centre
(CDC).
DESlDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 16(3), 1997

3.5

Technical Services

AU the technical services support required by
various Divisions of DESIDOC is provided by
the Technical Services Division (TSD). These
services include the following:

3.5.1 Online and Network Services
DESIDOC took initiative and obtained e-rnail
and Internet facilities for DRDO laboratories
and its headquarters by obtaining group
subscription to such facilities from ERNET of the
Department of Electronics (DOE) and the
RENNIC of National Informatics Centre (NIC).
This means, if any DRDO laboratory or office is
interested in having e-maillinternet facility,
DESIDOC contacts either ERNET or NICNET
authorities and arranges for installation of such
facility. DESIDOC presently uses both the
facilities at 2.4 kbps line speed and i t is
establishing a 64 'kbps link through ERNET for
accessing databases (including graphics and
multimedia) available on Internet. The I-Net
facility
of
the
Department
of
Telecommunications (DOTS is already available
in the Division which will be used for providing
online access from different places to all the
databases maintained by DESIDOC.
The TSD is also installing a local area
network (LAN) connecting the computers
functioning in various Divisions in the Centre.
This will help in better utilisation of computers
and their peripherals like printers and for
accessing the library and other information
online.

3.5.2 Multimedia and Reprographic
Services
The Division has excellent facilities for
preparing high quality 35 mm colour slides,
overhead projection transparencies and for
colour photography. These are used for
providing high quality presentation materials to
the scientists and the top level officials like the
Scientific Advisor to Defence Minister, Chief
Controllers (R&D), Directors of laboratories and
SO on.

Facilities for production of m u l t i d i a
CD-ROMs have also been recently established
and a few multimedia CDs are under
production.

The prrnting unit produces a large number of
publications/documents every year.

3.5.3 Printing Services

The fast developments taking place in
information science and technology necessitate
doing R&D work for their application at the
level of particular libraries or information
centres. Also, new applications for current
technologies are to be developed to suit local
requirements. With this view, an Research &
Development Facility (RDF) has recently been
started in DESIDOC. The RDF not only carries
out research on its ohn but also would
collaborate with external experts and institutions
to work on R&D problems of mutual interest.

DESlDOC provides printing services to the
DRDO HQrs and laboratories. For this, it
established a phototypesetting and offset.
printing unit. Manuscripts are also accepted in
the form of computer floppies and using a
special software, the text on the floppies is
transferred to the phototypesetting unit and the
final high resolution formatted text is obtained
and used for printing by offset process. When
the demand exceeds the capacity of the
printing unit and for multicolour printing jobs
with high quality photographs, the unit uses the
services of external printing presses.
