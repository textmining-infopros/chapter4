Software for Ranking lndian scientists Based on
Citations to Their Publication$
SC Saxena, Sonia Relan and SS Murthy
ABSTRACT
The paper describes the software developed at DESIDOC for ranking lndian
scientists and technologists based on the c~tationsto their publications as
covered in Science Ciktion lndex (SCI). The software projides facilities for
generating reports on highly cited authors, highly cited journals, highly
productive institutions, weightage of authorship etc. quickly. This measure
could be one of the important parameters'for rating the performance' of
scientists for giving awards, promotions or other career incentives and for
making appointments to important positions.

INTRODUCTION

Citation counting is one of the often used
methods of ranking' the performance of
scientists and technologists in their subject
fields. Presently, Science Citation lndex (SCI)
published by lnstitute for Scientific lnformation
(ISI), Philadelphia is the best source usually
available for carrying out such citation studies
but subscription of SCI is very expensive and
data is also spread on many CD-ROMs. By
using the SCICDs, one can firfd citation counts
of different papers and other contributions
made by scientia and technologists, and of
their institutions and of the journals publishing
these contributions. However, the search
software provided in the SCl-CDs only facilitates
search name after name for finding the citation
counts of their publications and for making
comparison among them. Such approach is a
very time consuming and laborious process. In
India, a few institutions like lndian National
Scientific Documentation Centre (INSDOC),
New Delhi; National Institute of Science,
' Technology
and Developments (NISTADS),
New Delhi; lndian National Science Academy
(INSA), New Delhi; etc carried out some
bibliometric studies and they have also faced

the same problems. Since it would be more
convenient to have listings of rank-wise
coctributions of cited authors, institutions and
journals, it was decided to develop an
application software for this purpose.
For developing a software for quickly and
almost automatically getting the desired citation
counts, a project proposal was submitted to
National Science and fechnol~gyManagement
lnformation System (NSTMIS), Dept of Science
and Technology (DST), New Delhi by Defence
Scientific lnformation and Documentation
Centre (DESIDOC), Delhi. The project was
sat~ctionedby NSTMIS to DESIDOC in August
1994. The software was developed as a
part-time activity of the authors (in addition to
the regular acitivities in their' respective jobs)
and was capleted by the end of 1997 and it
was demonstrated in early 1998. The software
provides an automated method for determining
and. listing the authors, and their institutions
andthe iournals publishing their contributions
in the order of their ranking in terms of their
citation counts.

METHODOLOGY

First, a close study was made of the
structure of the SCI database and the search
facilities available in the SCI search software.
Then detailed specifications were drawn for the
development of the so6are which would
provide the following functions:
(a) Identify the contributions by lndian scientists
covered in the SCI database.
(b) Download the bibliographic details of these
contributions.

3.

LIMITATION OF THE SCI-CD
SEARCH SOFTWARE

The following limitations of the SCI-CD
search software were observed during
downloading the data from SCI-CDs :
(i) Publications of lndian scientists who did not
give the addresses of their affiliated
organisation in India, could not
downloaded, because lndia doesn't app
as a search term in the corporate author fie

(c) Arrange the down loaded details in
alphabetical order by author, by title, by
name of journal, by specific subject, by
institution, etc.

(ii) ~ublic"ationsof the foreigners who cite
lndian scientists' work could not
downloaded because in their addresses a
lndia doesn't appear in the corporate auth
fietd.

(d) Generatingthe list of maximumcited authors,
journals, maximum productive institutions,
etc., both subject-wise and across different
subject fields in the order of decreasing
number of citations.

(iii) Publications of .foreign scientists who g
addresses ,of affiliated.organisations in In
were downloaded because lndia appeare
their addresses.

(e) Append new data frorn various updated
SCICD-ROM discs.

3.1

(f) Create various indices on various fields like
author, title, journal name, corporate source,
year, etc. to provide for faster search.

After completing the system analysis, the
software was developed in C++; as it is an
object-oriented programming language with
facility for fast retrieval from large databases.
After the development of software, the data
from SClCDs was down loaded. The data on
lndian scientists from SClCD was searched by
giving "India" as the search term, which is
present in the field "corporate author" in the
record of SCI. Except this key, there is no way to
downtoad all the records on lndian scientists
from the SCI at one time. The downloaded
records contain the following fields, viz., author,
tide of article, language, address of the scientists
(corporate source), journal name, year of
publication, type of document and cited
author/reference details. Then using the
software developed, the downloaded data was
rearranged in the defined database structure
and various indices were created on .different
fields for conducting faster searches on
individual fields or by combining two or more
fields using Boolean logic operators.

Limitations of the SCICD for
this study

(1) Coverage of lndian contributions in SCI-CDis
very low because SCI covers only 4500

iournals and out of which the lndian journals
are only twelve. For example, a subset
SCI-CD on chemistry citation Index, whic
was also used for this study, covers only
lndian journals i.e. lndian Journal
Chemistry
Section
Bio-Inorganic, Physical Theoretical
Analytical Chemistry, lndian journal
Chemistry Section &Organic Chemis
Industry Medicinal Chemistry, Journal
Scientific & Industrial Research an
Proceedings of the lndian Academy
Sciences-Chemical Sciences.
(2) The structure of SClCD is so complexth
is not possible to break the links among
citations when data is download
selectively. All the fields and subfieldscan n
be downloaded separately because they
are inter linked.

(3) Lack of standardisation in some fields. For :
example, if user wants to search or download j
records for a particular institution say, lndian ;
lnstitute of Technology, Delhi, it is not 2
possible from the database to download

because of lack of standardisation in using
the irames of the institutions and their
abbreviations. Secondly, place name of the
institutions is not indexed. Because of these
problems the correct ranking of the
institutions in terms of their productivity
become difficult in many cases.

SOFTWARE TESTING

5.

IMPORTANT OUTPUTS OF
THE SOFTWARE

The software provides facilities' for
manipulating the downloaded data in different
ways and generating various outputs. Some of
the important reports generated by the software
are as follows:

'

The software developed in C++ was 'tested
at DESIDOC by downloading about 9400
records of lndian authors (scientists) from
SCUD database covering data for the period
Jan-June 1993. Listings were created for
answering some sample questions as :
(a) who are the most cited lndian authors in
physical chemistry, and their ranking?

(b) which

are the
institutions whose
authors(scientists) are most cited and what
are the ranks of the institutions?

(c) which are the journals whose papers are most

cited and what are the ranks of these journals.
Results of the searches conducted showed
good performance of the software and meeting
the objectives of the project.
The project was reviewed in February 1997.
Lt was decided in the project Review meeting of
NSTIMS that DESIDOC should purchase a
subset of science citation index viz. Chemistry
citation index for further testing the software.
DESIDOC purchased this subset in 1997 and
downloaded the lndian contributions from
1991 to 1997 from 7 CD discs of chemical
citation index by conducting- search on
corporate source field. The downloaded data
was rearranged and searches were conducted.
The results of the searches conducted showed
good performance on this sample also.

-

(i) Ranking scientists, journals,
discipline-wise

institutions-

- highly cited authors (Appendix-2)
- highly cited journals (Appendix-3)

- higlily productive institutions.

'

(ii) Weightage of authorship.

EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM
THE SOFTWARE

The software provides a quick ' and
automated method for ranking scientists and
technologists for various purposes such as
according recognition of their work and giving
awards, and other career-based incentives. This
software could be distributed by the
Department of Science and Technology (DST)
who sponsored this project, to the institutions
receiving the SCI-CD for providing information
on the contributions of lndian scientists,
institutions and highly reputed journals, etc. It
would also be useful to the scientists and
institutions .studies and in the mapping of
science in lndia. This software can also be used
for providing useful information as mentioned
above, even for relating other countries. In
addition, the data downloadecl can be
accumulated over the years and used for many
bibliometric studies.
