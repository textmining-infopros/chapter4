GENESIS

Fifty years ago, India attained independence,
Rhetoric apart, we have come a long way after
breaking the shackles of slavery and have made
tremendous strides in various fields like
agricultu:~, industry, science and technology
etc. This progress or development, however,
took heavy toll of our natural resource base,
well beyond its carrying capacity and caused
irreversible damage to the environment.
Globally speaking, the first ever UN
Conference on Environment in 1972, at
Stockholm, warned us about this forthcoming
danger and also established the fact that
environment and development are two sides of
the same ioin. And, plundering the Earth's
resources could never lead to the sustainable
development of mankind.

With this backdrop, Ministry of Environment
.and Forests, Government of India, decided to
establish Environmental lnformation System

(ENVIS) Centres across the subcontinent to act
as communication bridges to reach out to the
masses. The basic premise was to empower
people through the powerful tool of
information
by
wolving
decentrafised
information paradigm and make them sensitive
towards environment.
ENVIS is a decentralised network consisting
of a Focal Point in the Ministry co-ordinating
the activities of a chain of '24 subject-specitic
nodes
located
in
various
prestigious
institutions/organisations all over the country. In
the area of 'Information Systems on
Environmentally Sound and Appropriate
Technologies [ESAT)', the Ministry has selected
a prestigious research organisation narnery
Society for Development Alternatives (for
brevity it i s known as Development
Alternatives) where lnformation Systems on
Environmentally Sound and Appropriate
Technologies is jocated.

Information Systems on Environmentally
Sound and Appropriate Technologies was
established in
1984 at
Development
Alterriatives, New Delhi. Since'its inception it is
an integral part of the organisation and works
closely with its other branches which develop
and disseminate appropriate t&nologies and
institutional
systems
for
sustainable
dewhpment. A brief profile of Development
Alternatives, at this juncture is pertinent.

2.

DEVELOPMENT
ALTERNATIVES: A BRIEF
PROFILE

Development Alternatives is a global
network of organisations with the objective of
generating activities aimed at sustainable
development.
Development Alternatives, India, is a
nonprofit
research,
development
and
consultancy organisation established in 1983. It
fosters the new relationship in the people,
technology and environment interactions
needed to attain the goal of sustainable
development. It has two branches

(i)TSB (Technology Systems Branch)-rocuses
on designing and developing lnformation
Systems on Environmentally Sound and
Appropriate Technologies in close collaboration
with the other branches. Several technology
packages in Shelter, Domestic Energy,
Handmade Paper, Textiles, Pottery, etc. have
already been disseminated and others are in
various stages of development.

(ii)ESB (Environment Systems Branch)--designs
environment and development management
strategies at various geographic scales and levels
of detail. Experimental-cum-demonstration
projects are also undertaken in the field. The
range of field studies and projects include
environmental impact assessment and analysis,
environmental
management
plans,
environmental and social policies and
procedures for corporate organisations,
community development, food security in tribal
areas, rehabilitation and resettlement, pollution
prevention, cleaner production, waste
management, natural resources management

using geographical information system (GIs) &
remote sensing, income generation through
microenterprises, and biodiversity conservation.
Besides R&D workshops, support is also
drawn from a well equipped computer unit-an
accredited
lnformation
Systems
Unit,
Communication Unit and Geomatics Facility.
The Environmental Monitoring Facility can
undertake soil, water and air analyses.
The regional office in Bangalore in the past
eight years of its operation has built up
considerable expertise in the field of low-cost
construction using appropriate technologies
and local materials as well as income
generation activities. This regional office looks
after the operations in Karnataka and other
Southern States.
The regional office in jhansi looks after the
operations in Bundelkhand region. It has.shown
excellent reults on ground during the past b u r
years in wasteland development, natural
regeneration, soil & moisture conservation,
community
irrigation
systems
and
income-generationactivities.

-

An 'Appropriate Technology Centre' is being
established in Olrhha (TARAGram), Madhya
Pradesh. This Centre is a unique experiment in
design and dissemination of appropriate
technologies in the ,Bundelkhand region.
A field station is now operational in Tumkur,
Karnataka to take up wastelands regeneration
and Watershed management in the region.
Affiliated institutions of Development
Alternatives, namely SARA (Technology and
Action for Rural Advancement), TNK (Tara
Nirman Kendra), DESl Power (Decentralised
Energy Systems India) produces and market a
range of environment friendly products, such as
building materials handmade paper, handloom
and renewable energy systems.
lnformation Systems Unit of Development
Alternatives is designated as Information
Systems on Environmentally Sound and
Appropriate Technologies.

OBJECTIVES

lnformation Systems on Environmentally
Sound and Appropriate Technologies has

'

organised and developed an automated library
and information system
to disseminate
inforrnation on information systems on
environmentally sound and appropriate
technologies and related subjects to both
internal and external users. Right from its
inception, this ENVIS centre is playing an
important role in exchange of information and
providing relevant information both in
anticipation and on demand to both internal
and external users.
The objectives of lnformation Systems on
Environmentally Sound and Appropriate
Technologies are listed below:

5.

COLLECTION O F DATA AND
INFORMATION

Collection of relevant data and information,
has started almost simultaneously right from the
inception of Development Alternatives which is
recognised as a research organisation by the
Ministry of Science & Technology, Government
of India.
When
lnformation
Systems
on
Environmentally Sound and Appropriate
Technologies was established in 1984, the
policy of procurement of documents was

(a) Designing and organising user oriented and
automated lnformation system;

(b) Retrieving relevant data and information in
user friendly way;
(c) Providing data and information support to
research and action aimed at sustainable
national development;
(d) Disseminating information globally through
networking;
(e) Sharing the resources; and

(9

Evolving better
methodologies and
techniques for retriwal of relevant
information to the users, efficiently.

mainly restricted to hard copies which was
prevailing during those days. But, with the
advances in technologies, especially in
electronics, the policy of collection of rdwdnt
data and inforhation has been broadened to
cover not only hard copies, but also diskettes
and CD-ROMs. This change became necessary,
over the years, to make lnformation Systems on
Environmentally Sound and Appropriate

'

Technologies as a partly electronic library and
partly library of hard copies, at the dawn of 21 st
century. We took this decision, based on our
experience in observing the physiology and
psychology of users of lnformation Systems on
Environmentally Sound and Appropriate
Technologies. Because, still majority of users
prefer hard copies to electronic media.
However, this trend is likely to change in the
coming years, since relatively new sources of
information, such as online access, diskettes
and CD-ROMs are becoming popular, gradually.
Resources of relevant data and information
of lnformation Systems on Environmentally
Sound and Appropriate Technologies is given
below:

RESOURCES

Resources available with Information
Systems on Environmentally Sound and
Appropriate Technologies for 1997-98 are as
follows
Books
Newsletters & Journals
Annual Reports

It is interesting to note that Information
Systems on Environmentally Sound and
Appropriate ~ec'hnolo~ies
is also housed in a
building which is built by environmental sound
building materials, such as compressed earth
blocks which are the products developed by a
research team of Development Alternatives.
Developmbnt Alternatives's
policy of
collection of data and information, also covers
the procurement of useful reference books,
16

especially statistical documents either in
exchange to our publication or gratis from
several organisations, such as United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP), United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP),
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF),
United Nations
Industrial Development
Organisation
(UNIDO),
The
World
Conservation Union (IUCN), International
lnstitute for Sustainable Development (IISD),
International
lnstitute
for
Environment
Development (IIED), The World Bank,
Worldwatch Institute, GATE/GTZ (Germany),
SKAT (Switzerland), Ministry of Environment
and Forests, Government of India and Tata
Energy Research Institute (TERI), in addition to
procurement of useful documents, from time to
time.
For instance, about 3000 copies of our
monthly newsletter,
titled Development
Alternatives are mainly sent as gratis and a few
on exchange-basis, just to disseminate
information on Environmental management
(EM) and Environmentally Sound Appropriate
Technologies (ESAT).

USE OF NEW INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGIES

Advanced Information Technologies are
boon for producing, organising and analysing
data and information.
Databases are created and periodically
updated as and when we constantly add
documents to our existing resources, to keep
abreast with latest information and data in each
subject in which we are interested. Two
computers, viz.-(ij PC PentiumPro and (ii)
PC/AT are used as hardware for this purpose.
CDS/ISIS ver 2.3 & 3.0 software developed by
Unesco works on Windows platform.

8.

DATABASE DESIGN AND
DEVELOPMENT

The database of documents is created and
updated by using CDS/ISIS software.
After accessioning each document, it is
catalogued by using standard coding sheet.
Then it is classified according to UDC (BS
1000M), 2nd edition, 1993. Keyword indexing

is done, so that thought content of each
document is fully represented by required
number of keywords and this has enabled us to
retrieve information efficiently to users, at faster
rate. For vocabulary control while keyword
indexing, we use a thesaurus, titled EnVoc:
Multilingual Thesaurus of Environmental Terms,
brought out by UNEP, in May 1997.

Common Communications Format (CCF)

* Structured format for computer readable
bibliographic records.
* Detailed and structured method for
recording mandatory and optional data

* Provision to build in-house, CCF compatible
format.
Retrieval of information from this database is
several times faster and efficient when
compared to manually operated libraries and
information systems which depend on age old
catalogue cards and catalogue cabinet.
Since the search commands in CDS/lSlS
software are efficient, when the user
approaches for information she/he mentions
the specific subject(s) in which information is
required. The database is searched by a
keyword or all possible keywords to find all
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 1999,19(2)

available documents on each specific subject.
Since documents are arranged in a classified
sequence according to UDC, needed
documents are made available to the user,
quickly.
Apart from this, professional staff members
of lnformation Systems on Envi~onmentally
Sound and Appropriate Technologies, while
providing reference service to the users, also
provide additional documents which are also
sources of relevant data and information.

8.1

Database of Remote Sensing and
Geographic lnformation Systems

A database of micro documents of Remote
Sensing and Geographic lnformation Systems
(CIS) is created and updated. Ceomatics facility
of Development Alternatives is used for
decision making on sustainable development
issue in the areas of (i) Rural Environment
Systems Applications; Industrial and Urban
Environment Systems Applications and (iii)
Biodiversity Conservation Systems Applications.
This database provides data and information on
these subjects.

8.2

Database on Waste Management

A database of micro documents of waste
management is created and updated.

8.3

Database of Selected Papers

Database of selected papers/articles from
periodicals and conference proceedings which
are available in lnformation Systems on
Environmentally Sound and Appropriate
Technologies and in the libraries of two
organisations which are gladly sharing resources
of information and data with Development
Alternatives, is created and periodically
updated. These organisations are: (i) Tata
Energy Research lnstiiute (TERI) and (ii) Sapru
House Library. Since lnformation Systems on
Environmentally Sound and Appropriate
Technologies is giving equal importance in
providing right information and data, to right
persons at right time to two types of users, viz.
(1) users from different parts of India and
occasionally from abroad and (2) users from
Development Alternatives and affiliated
institutions, this database is very much useful.

17

Because, in spite of the best available resources,
no Environmental lnformation System in the
world can always provide needed information
and data to its users f r o n ~ its resources.
Whatever is not available from its resources, can
be obtained by several ways, such as: (1) Inter
library co-operation and ( 2 ) Online access to
information and data, without any geographical
barrier.

The independent sector needs timely, useful
and reliable information for decision support. A
large part of this information, though available,
is not easily accessible to them.
Development Alternatives is in a position to
provide a leadership role in bridging this
information gap, by facilitating the independent
sector organisations to have access to
information by adopting the latest advances in
information and telecommunication technology.
DAINET would essendally consolidate and
considerably upgrade the information products,
services and facilities currently being offered to
Independent sector organisations. It would
make relevant information available fast and in a
user-friendly form for sustainable development
effort.

Electronic Mail
With DAINET's email, users can exchange
messages and files with &nail users anywhere
in the world.

. The offline nature of this communication
technology adopted by DAINET is well suited
for Indian conditions where line quality is poor.
All mail composition work is done without
engaging the phone line which is only used for
mail transfer to and from the server. The actual
connect time for an average mail transfer (about
10 KB) is less than half a minute which makes
this system economical even for users dialling
on STD lines.

File Trader
Users can exchange software files, e.g, on
MS-Word, PageMaker, Lotus, dBase etc.
Conferencing
A series of conferences on common topics
of interest can be created and accessed by user
groups on the network. As part of a conference
a user can access and post recent changes to it.
Users can also access Usenet newsgroups
which are available on Internet.

10. FUTURE PLANS
(a) Further enriching resources of lnformation
Systems on Environmentally Sound and
Appropriate Technologies, if additional
funds are granted by funding agencies, to
make this more and more useful to the
public, all over the world;

(b) Adopting latest technologies, especially in
the fields of electronics, telecommunication
and global networkins from time to time,
not only for the tasks of organisation
synthesis of Environmental Data and
lnformation, but also retrieving data
information efficiently to the users all over
the world, both in anticipation and demand.

Database
DAINET has published a comprehensive
NGOs Directory of India, which is titled as
DAlNET NGO Directory in 15 volumes. Salient
feature of this publication is that this gives full
profile of each NGO in each state of India by
covering its address, telephone numbefs, fax,
mail, contact person, two key persons, year of
establishment, year of registration, FCRA,
Registered
under
working
languages,
geographical area of operation, active in,
branch locations, parent organisation and
location, approximate annual budget, sources of
funds, aims, staffing pattern framework of
activities and collaboration, products & services.
This has been published in English. This
directory will be available on diskettes and also
on CD-ROMs by December 1998.

DAlNET has also published another useful
directory, titled DAlNET Funding Sources
Directory which gives details of funding
schemes of each donor agency.
Other databases include a wide range of
products and customised information services
like Topic Specific Bibliographies (TSB), Current
Awareness
Services
(CAS),
Selective
(SO!),
Fact
Sheets,
Dissemination lnformation
Conference Alerts, etc.
The client could access this information
either online or off line by using the
statesf-the-art
communication
software
supplied by DAINFI:
In addition, DAtNET will provide a
communication software package. Technical
support would be made available for installation
and training.

(c) Creating and updating of databases of the
data and information generated by
Development Alternatives, such as database
of about 400 research reports publications.
(d) Sharing resources with like
organisations and individuals;

minded

(e) Housing lnformation Systems on
Environmentally Sound and Appropriate
Technologies in a welt furnished and big
building to accommodate more and more
number of users; and

(0

Human Resources Development by way of
deputing professionals to refresher courses
periodically, promoting them periodically
and also recruiting right professionals.

(g) Disseminating lnformation through Internet
and Delhi Library Network (DELNET).

12. CONCLUSION
Relevant data and information on
en~ironm~ntologyis nbt only needed by
researchers,
specialists,
technologists,
decision-makers, industrialists, academicians
and students, but also by every citizen of the
world, from time to time, to determine whether
the environment in which she/he lives is safe.
For instance, whether the geographical area
where a person lives is free from air and water
pollution, after allowing tolerable limits of these
pollutions. Hence, Ministry of Environment and
Forests and ENVlS Centres have to play
important roles in (i) collecting; (ii) organising;
(iii) synthesising; (iv) sharing and (v)
disseminating relevant data and information
