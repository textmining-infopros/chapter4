The impact of Electronic Publishing
on Academic Libraries
Thomas B Mickey
OCLC Online Computer Library Center
Dublin, Ohio, USA.
Abstract

As a result of the availability of electronic publications, the libraries
have the option of not subscribing to their printed versions. The
paper discusses the transformation of academic libraries with such
technological changes and why it is occurring now. It also discusses
the impact of the World Wide Web and the role of publishers in the
electronic world. It also discusses the role of the librarian and the
library in future.

The impact of electronic publishing is
just beginning to be felt in academic
libraries. All the major abstracting and
indexing (A & I) services have been
available electronically for decades, and
a visit to a typical library's reference
area will show few, if any, users of the
printed indexes, but many users of online
and CD-ROM indexes. With the advent
of fixedcost subscription access to A &
I services, libraries have the option of
cancelling many paper-based subscriptions
altogether. This type of change is about
to happen with scholarly journals also,
and as a result, libraries will never be
the same.

Technical innovation is nothing new
to libraries [I]. From the advent of the
typewriter and electric light to the
photocopier and online catalogue, libraries
have adapted to new technologies with
relatively minor changes in the institution
as a whole. Given this, it is reasonable
to ask, since electronic information
systems have been around lor many
years, why should electronic publishing
have any greater impact on libraries than
other technical changes, and just as
important, why now? Won't the sheer
inertia
of
publishers and
libraries'
investment in paper form make any
transition to electronic a gradual one?

transformation.
Modernisation is the
adoption of new technologies to improve
current services.
The library does not
change in any fundamental way during
modernisation; it contirues to do what
it has been doing, albeit more efficiently.
Many current electronic publishing experiments, such as Elsevier's TULIP (The
University Llcensing Program) project [3,4]
fall into this category.
In the TULIP
project, documents, previously available
through paper subscriptions, are being
scanned and supplied in electronic form
to a group of libraries, which in turn
are developing systems to work with
these documents to make them available
to their patrons. The desire of both the
publisher and the libraries i s to see how
such electronic versions of the documents
can be accommodated within, and what
changes need to be made to, current
operations. In many ways, the amount
of information made available is large
(something like 100,000 pages, or 10
gigabytes of data), and simply the
technical aspects of providing access to
it can be challenging, let alone implementing the related changes in training
and
procedures.
But this
is still
modernisation.
The
documents
are
subscribed to and acquired by the library.
The only fundamental change so far is
a transition from reliance on copyright
to restrict use of the documents to
signing a contract specifying the use of
the electronic versions.

Transformation is more radical, and
that i s what is happening to A & I
services in libraries. The paper copy is
no longer available at the library at all.
In many cases, the library i s still acquiring
the information (e.g., on CD-ROM), but
there is no real need to restrict the
user's access to this information in the
library. Given the proper equipment, users

can access the services from anywhere.
The advent of fixed-price subscriptions
to online services, wch as OCLC's
Firstsearch service, have, in many cases,
made it more economical for libraries
to not acquire the material at all, but
to rely on a central service. Electronic
publishing of primary materials will
intensify this transformation.

2 . WHAT IS A LIBRARY?
My favourite definition sf a library is
an institution that selects, acquires,
organises, and provides access to recorded
knowledge. This i s obviously a very broad
definition, but both the collecting and
organising aspects of librarianship are
threatened by electronic publishing.

When it becomes cheaper to offer
patrons access to material that is stored
electronically
than
on paper,
then
electronic access will rapidly become
accepted, in spite of any limitations it
has. One of the primary characteristics
of scholarly publishing is that the use
of any particular article is fairly low, low
enough that it will probably be cheaper
to store the material at central sites
rather than at each library. In spite of
being in electronic form, the amount of
material that a typical library acquires
in paper form is still a substantial burden.
This will push sibraries into using (or
creating!) central repositories to handle
the electronic versions. Remote access
to electronic publications is so easy and
fast, that the lack of local storage should
not be a problem to the users; hardly
noticeable, in fact, if the system i s
constructed properly.

Hickey - Impact of Electronic Publishing on Acdemic Libraries

Reducing, and eventually halting the
collection and storage of primary research
materials will be the biggest change that
academic libraries have ever faced. Much
of what we presently think of as a
library will have to change, although the
physical changes will not be apparent
for years, Libraries will still be collecting
books, CDs, and many other forms of
packaging information for distribution, but
probably not the journal literature that
they collect today.

3. WHY NOW1
Computers, electronic typesetting, and
computer networks have all been around
for decades. If there is really a change
coming, why now? Are our predictions
now any better than those of previous
years [ยงI?
A number of things have
changed:

a+ Personal computers : Today's PC has
the power to handle the software
needed for remote connections and
display of journal articles.

systems : M i c r o s o f t
Windows gives the PC the ability to
hande complex documents
and
telecommunications protocols.

e Windowing

a Network access : Use of the Internet
is exploding. In academic circles, access
is nearly universal in the U.S.

e Price : Prices of storage, displays, CPUs,
software, and networks are all dropping
to the point where student use of
sophisticated workstations is the norm.
Decreasing costs are what
of this. The combination of
changes has helped to create
Wide Web.
They have also

to affect libraries to the point where it
is now probably cheaper to provide
access to scholarly journals electronically
than to acquire, store and manage paper
versions.

4. THE WORLD WIDE WEB
The World Wide Web j
[6,
71 is a hypertext system built on top
of the Internet. Web browsers, suck as
NCSA Mosaic, allow users to easily
browse through tens of thousands sf
sites around the world. More importantly,
the protocols that the WWW is built
upon are simple enough that anyone
can learn how to create documents and,
with a little bit of help, mount them
for general access. All of the sudden,
nearly anyone with access to a computer
on the lnternet can publish one's own
papers. Obviously this self-publication is
not quite the same as getting one's
paper in a well-known, peer-reviewed
journal read by thousands of people,
but it does have these advantages: It is
immediate-no publication delay; revisions
can be made just as fast. Anyone can
get to it-millions of people have better
access to it than to articles in their
library.
Over the last two years, electronic
access has been provided to all sorts
of things, which were difficult to obtain
before, ranging from manuscripts to
technical manuals. Much of this material
has
colour
graphics
and
typeset
appearance, and, with new technologies
such as Java [8], pages are starting to
have sound and animation. This has
increased expectations about obtaining
more conventionally published materials.
Another
aspect
of
networked
communications, which i s startling when

Micke$.- lmpacb of Electronic Publishing on Acdemic Libraries

first encountered, is the speed at which
ideas can propagate. Web browsers are
a good example of this. Within 18
months of the introduction of Mosaic
by NCSA, millions of people were using
the software.
Even more amazing was
the introduction of Netscape's Web
browser, which persuaded the majority
of Web users to start using their browser
instead of Mosaic, within about six
months. Without the immediacy and ease
sf access that the internet allows,
developments Dike these would have taken
years, not ,months.

It is hard to overstate the impact that
the
has had on how electronic
publishing i s viewed by existing publishers.
Three years ago, electronic publishing
was something that was starting to look
possible, but with uncertain demand.
Now both commercial and scholarly
associations are aware that their clientele
is rapidly using publication channels
outside the traditional ones and are
willing and expecting to use the same
access techniques to get to scholarly
documents. To publishers, the process
looks slightly more complicated than it
appears to a Web user. Electronic journals
are still in rapid development 191. Many
technical problems need to be solved,
but most professional associations and
large
commercial
publishers
are
investigating electronic
publishing as
rapidly as possible.

5. PUBLISHERS IN Ahl
ELEaRONIC WORLD
It is hard to predict what long-term
effects the
will have on existing
publishers. Their role in managing the
peer-review process and collecting papers

into reasonably coherent and stable
journals has been of great benefit in
paper publishing, and it seems likely that
it
will be important in electronic
publishing.
whether new forms of
hypertext publishing, refereed or not, will
displace any of the more traditional forms
of publication remains to be seen, bun
it is certainly possible, as is the possibility
that traditional publishers can broaden
their offerings and actually expand their
contribution to scholarly knowledge. Few
of the probable scenarios, however, have
libraries as central to the process of
transferring knowledge in the future as
they are at present.

What is clear is that publishers will
not be eager to accept substantially less
compensation for their materials than
they do now. As a matter of fact, the
need to publish articles in both electronic
and paper forms i s increasing their costs;
with lower printing costs being the only
real
possibility
for
immediate cost
reductions. Atkinson [lo], along with
many others, proposes that universities
reserve copyright to their faculties' works
and form consortia to do the publishing,
but as Lynch [ I 1 1 points out this idea
does not seem very likely to survive
either the outcry of the faculty, who
would lose control over where to publish
their research, or the legal challenges by
publishers and others.

possibility, of actually collecting it.
Electronic access does not just make it
cheaper or easier for libraries eo provide
material to patrons; it makes the librarians
nearly irrelevant to the access. Previous
technological changes in libraries have
changed the tools available to work with
library collections. Electronic publishing
changes the substance of what libraries
deal with. Electronic access by-passes
much of what is central to the library's
role today.

electronic versions. Centraiised services,
such as OCLG", are certainly capable
of such preservation, but collection into
only a few such sites will be a much
more delicate system than the present
one of paper and libraries. Solutions
seem far off for preservation problems
of digital information, but they are getting
some attention [ I 21.

Libraries are an integral part of the
publishing process of today. They are
both a major source (in many cases the
major source) of the revenue that supports
scholarly publications as well as the
repository that makes the material
available into the indefinite future.
Librarians like to think of access to their
collections in terms of hundreds of years.
This is in stark contrast to the typical
computer systems administrator who
seldom can plan even a decade ahead,
because the rapid and unpredictable
changes in hardware and software make
such planning impossible. Centralisation
of electronic publications places a
long-term archiving function on computer
services, which are illequipped to handle
them. It is not that long-term storage of
computerised data i s impossible, but that
computers are so recent that few
databases have been maintained much
longer than 20 years, and the complexities
of the formats needed for publishing
quality documents make their storage
more difficult than the relatively simple
databases created in earlier decades.

The library as a building will not go
away in the foreseeable future; there wil!
still be plenty of paper documents to
store in jibraries for many years to come,
but the library's role as the principal
collect or of documents used by advanced
students and researchers will disappear.
As an institution, the library has been
created mainly to manage a large volume
of paper, most of which will no longer
be printed. We must then ask "What
does that Beave as the mission of the
library?"

The publishers have relied on libraries
to preserve the paper versions of their
products, but, without economic incentive,
it seems unlikely that libraries will reliably
the
undertake the
preservation of

7. THE LIBRARY" SOLE

Some of these are:

e Contracting for services : Many of the
electronic services that are to replace
the current paper services will not be
free. They will need to be identified,
organised, and contracted for.
Subscriptions to the services seem like
the most viable method of payment,
since
subscriptions
provide a
predictable cost that libraries can
budget for, as well as a reliable revenue
stream for the producer. All of this is
an obvious and useful role for libraries.

Most services will be
designed to be used by the patrons
through
themselves,
rather
than

e insfr~ction :

Sickey - Empact of E / ~ ~ o nPublishing

intermediaries such as librarians, but
that doesn't mean that locating and
using them all is going to be easy.
Problems inherent in the Bocation and
use of information will always require
professional expertise to deal with. The
instructional role librarians have
traditionall)P filled in the use of
collections should transfer fairly easily
into instruction about electronic
services. This may be more challenging
than before; given the volatility of
electronic services, the librarians may
be hard-pressed to keep up with the
continual changes we can expect.

ts

Hardware a n d . software : Academic
libraries have for years been places
where the resources to access electronic
resources, such as personal computers,
CD-ROM, and telecommunications,
were available. Although personal
access (say from a student's dormitory)
to such resources is becoming more
common, we can expect that there will
always be patrons for whom access at
the library is more convenient. The
library can also be a place where new
equipment and telecommunications
capabilities, which are beyond the
financial reach of most patrons, could
be made available. These systems,
combined with the availability of
instruction, will perform a necessary
service.

a Space : Academic libraries have also
always been places to study, beyond
any actual use of the library collection.
This need will still be there, for both
individual and group study. Space for
collaboration may become even more
important than it is today because of
the need of groups to be physically
14

near each other and with access to
of
computer
and
the
sort
telecommunications systems that the
library could provide.

9

Local collections : The increased ease
of publishing electronically is true for
libraries as well as individuals and other
groups. All libraries have collections
of local interest and many have unique
collections of wider interest, but which
are presently nearly inaccessible.
Electronic publishing and the WVLW
offer methods for libraries to digitise
existing collections and make both
descriptions and facsimiles of the items
universally available. Although many
local collections are hardly used,
electronic access could completely
change that, and, if a modest fee could
economically be collected for access,
the
whole
system
could
be
self-supporting. Publication is not one
of the strengths of current libraries
(beyond their catalogues), but the
transformed institution envisioned here
may well be able to successfully mount
information for their institution on the
W. Libraries to date have certainly
been among the most progressive
institutions on university campuses in
taking advantage of the Web.

The changing role of libraries will
affect how libraries are built as well as
operated. A good reflection of this can
be found in Bazillion [ I 21.

8. THE LIBRAREAN'S ROLE
It is tempting to define a librarian as
'someone who works in a library; but
that definition i s much too narrow. The
DESlDOC Bulletin of Inf Technoi,1W6,16i1)

Hickey - Impact of Eiectronic Publishing on Acdemic Libraries

tasks librarians perform in identifying and
organising materials are still needed for
electronically published materials, and may
be appreciated more, since the alternative
is more visibly obvious. The title librarian
may gradually disappear as fewer librarians
are actually associated with a physica!
library, but the needs will still be there.

9, CONCLUSION
Academic libraries will be undergoing
rapid and profound changes over the
next decade as electronic publication of
scholarly materials becomes prevalent. As
the need for collection of periodicals
dwindles, much of the mechanism which
is the library, will no longer be needed.
Librarians, however, will be needed more
than ever to cope with the increased
availability of materials, indexes, interfaces,
finding aids, and formats. Long-term
archiving and access to electronic
materials are an unsolved problem.

The changes discussed in this paper
are becoming so widely acknowledged
that recently a large number of articles
have appeared about the 'future of the
library'.

overview of these is in Drabenstott (141.
