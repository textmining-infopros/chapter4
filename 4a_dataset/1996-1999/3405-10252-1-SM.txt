Access to Socio-Economic Data
with Particular Reference to India

In India, statistical agencies responsible for colkction, processing and
disseminatim oi s o c k o n o m k statistics in a dtcentraYsed wt up, release
dala mostly in ihe form of serials and reporls. Propr and easy nccess to
data depends an tactws such as rdease of uwrs' guidtJ/methdo+ogicai
h a n d h k s , timeliness in release of aata, provision fw access to unpubkshed
data and use of electronic media for data dissemrnatbn. Of late. these
apncies nave taken certain measures to meet the data needs 04 users.
lnternatimll agencies such as the UN and stat:si)cal ofiices of dwcloped
countries have started wing modern t e c h r a h y t d s like CD-ROM and
INTERNET for wid# dissemination of data. An attitudiml change ir still
needed for prwiding pmper and easy access to sociwmmmlc data.

SOURCES OF DATA

recessary steps fw dissemination of statistiwhich were contained irr their databases. Data
are rnaoe available to t

serial publications and ad hoc reports at
subsidised rates or free of cost, and m t t i n ~ e s

In fact, requirements of the data users vary
and serials published in a fixed pdeterrnined
format do not satisfy all users. Uswlly spxial
tables are generated on demhnd for users lib
the Planning Commission. Policy makers need
macro 1-1
data or data in wmmadsed form.
On the contrary, planners and researchers need
micro level data and the full report including the
analysis.
In order to make data accessible to users,
the statistical agencies take certain measures
which include release of users' guides and
catalogues of publications; documentation of
concepts; compilation of methodological
handbooks; timeliness in publication of data;
provision for access to unpublished data; use of
electronic media for data dissemination, etc All
these factors coledively determine the
accessibility to data.

USERS' GUIDES AND
BIPLIOCRAPHICAL TOOLS

Statistical agencies like CSO, NSSO, etc.,
have compiled certain 'Users' Cuide or Key to
Literature' h i & provide an insight into the
contents of various statistical serials. These
'Guides' or 'Keys'
are also used as
bibliographical aids. The most widely known
reference book for the users of data is Cuide to
Official Statistics 1987 compiled by CSO. The
earlier editions of this guide were released in
1979 and 1985 respective&. The guide includes
details about scope, coverage, methods used for
collection of data and data comparability on
different subjects. An index prwided in the
Annexure lists statistical serials alphabetically
and provides references to the page number in
which the scope of the listed serials have been
explained.
Another useful guide for the users of
statistics is Directory of Statistics, India 1990,
compiled and published by CSO. The first
edition of this guide was published in 1976. It
lists the different statistical series on which data
are mailable. Different details such as source
organisation, title of publidon, periodicity of
data and the level of presentation are included
in it Another annual publication Sample Survey
of Current Interest in India by CSO provides
information pertaining to sample surveys started
OESIDoC 8ulktin of lnf Technd, 1998,18(8

during the prwious year. Other reference &Is
indude Oimctwy of k i a l Statisria (1990) and
Statistical Sp&m in lndia (f 989).
A close lodr at the structure and contents of
these guides wouM reveal that there is a lack of
professionatism in their compilation. The format
of the index and the annexures like lists of
publicatbns with inadequate bibliographical
details do not provide comprehensive
information to the users. These aencies should
therefore associate professionally qualified and
experienced staff for the compilation of these
guidebooks as is usually done by foreign
organisations~nstitutions.
For
statistical
example, Guide to Official Staristics (1990)
compiled by the Office of National Statistics, in
the United Kingdom has a keyword index
prepared by a professional librarian which
provides the location of about 5000 key words
in the main part of the Cuide. Most of the
Indian guides are published by the statistical
agencies for their own official use; and except
for Cuide to O f f i a l Statisbics, none of these
guides are milable to users through book trade
channels. These guides do not have a regular
revision policy and therefore hey become
outdated wihin a short time of their
publication. Morewer, while providing details
about the serials, there guides do not
distinguish between priced and unpriced
publications. Also it is usually difficult for the
users to identify the publications superscribed
'for official use' or 'for restricted circulation'.

The users of statistical publications have to
rely mostly on irregular bibliographical sources.
For instance, Controller of Publications
announces &he release of certain current
publications through List of New Arrivals which
appears in newspapers and journals. Another
source is Catalogue of Gmmment of India's
Civil Publiations which is essentially a
publisher's catalogue containing w e n the
details of old publications which are available
for sale. Monrhfy Abstract of Statistics, compiled
by CSO contains an annotated list of priced
CSO publications.
Various independent agencies such as
NSSO, RGI, Labour Bureau, DCClS also
publicise their serials and reports through their
catalogues published periodically. As regards

Global Development Finance so as to refled the
current trends in international capital M .
National statistical offices of several
developed countries haw also adopted
decrronic media for data dissemination. For
instance, in 1 994, S&&tial Absmcr of United
Sfates was released on CD-ROM. In USA, the
Gwernment has advocated for the private
dissemination d government statistlca! data as a
mechanism to help defray the costs of data
collection. A new information industry has been
developed for promoting the use of government
inbrmatbn with private statistical records, The
repackaged records are now sold to both
business and government8.

Index to International Slatistics (\I$),
pubJisbed by Con#ressiond Information Service
(USA), i s a reference source bmk, available in
printed as well as electronic form.
Fundamentally, IIS is an index to statistics as
distinct from an Index to p u ~ t i o n s g 7he
.
coverage includes virtually all statisti=
contained in periodicals, annuals, biennials,
monographs, etc, made available by UN system
and other similar agencies. 1S contains indexes
and abstracts of more than 1700 titles annually
from approximately 100 major international
agencies, including 60 UN principal organs and
affiliated agencies. As a back-up service, it
prwides, in a companion microfiche file, the
complete text of most puMications identified by
the index''.
Another source, Statistical Abstracts from the
M a w of Fact Datahe, published by Pierian
Press, USA is available on CD-ROM. It contains
more than 50,000 citations with abstracts and
statistics to textual materials on current political,
social, economics and environmental issues
worldwide. These are extracted from about 250
general interest p e r i d i d s and newspapers.
Indexing is done using Library of Congress
subject headings.
Two other sources, CRONOS and Economist
Inkliigence Unit International Statistics, reteased
by Commission of the European Communities
and Economists Intelligence Unit Ltd,, London
are online databases". CRONOS contains more
than 900,000 time series of economic data an
countries in the European Community and

other countries worldwide. The subject
cowrage includes general statistics, M g n
trade a w g a t e s industrial survey and sectorial
information, energy, agricultural products, prices
and accounts, balance of payment, financial
accounts, national accounts, and research and
development.
The online database by Economists
Intelligence Unit contains mare than 290 time
series of macro economic data on nan-OECD
countries. It includes monthly data for 66
developing countries and annual time series far
seven Eastern-Block countries; covering national
income, popubtion, trade and national debt. In
fact, it makes a credit risk assessment of
countries by including data, on political risk
factors, economic and financial status, and short
term foreign exchange risk. Data is available
online through Reutors Information Services
(~anada)".

Use of lnternet

The growth of Internet has been
phenomenal over the past one and a half years.
A number of national agencies have devehped
sites on Internet. Statistics Canada has a well
designed and properly maintained site. A
comprehensive online portfolio is offered,
providing aIb subscription services such
as CANSlM time series data and International
trade database. Public Information is neatly
classified by topics-land, people, economy, and
state; and a daily news service is maintained,
providing
key
figures
and
headline
inf~rmation'~.
Office of the National Statistics, UK has also
developed site on Internet along similar lines
with an emphasis on providing public
information where appropriate; and introduced
the Databank subscription service.
An important issue concerning Internet
activity i s charging for information, particularly
from public bodies. In this regard, national
agencies have adopred different policies;
starting from Statistics Norway, where most
information i s freely available, to the US
Department of Commerce. The latter's site is
excellent in construction but also
commercial in its approach, with the
introduction of charging for most services

provided. Howewr, US Bureau of Census
maintain an extremely informatiw site with
many facilities, including thematic mapping
service and makes much of this publicly
available.

fhe national agencies of other countries
such as Australian Bureau of Statistics; Federal
Statistid office, Germany; Statistics Bureau,
Japan; Central Bureau of Statistics, Indonesia;
etc., have also developed sites on Internet. In
most cases, the sites have been established
within the context of national audience rather
than viewing Internet as an international
venture14.
A great deal of data are n o w provided at
international level of inter-governmental
agencies. The problem with the data provided
by these bodies is that 'they are often
reconstructed rather than directly observed....
the reconstruction is often cruder with more
guesswork than analysis. There are enough
arbitrariness in these figures to make the purists
shrink at the thought of touching such data.
Given the scarcity of reliable primary
information, the purist position can almost lead
to
abstinence
from
empirical
work
altogetherJ5.

10. CONCLUSIONS
Statistical
agencies
producing
s o c i ~ o n o m i cdata serve rnany groups. The
users are heterogeneous in terms of their
information needs, the way in which they use
statistical data, their analytic abilities to
manipulate data, etc. If a statistical agency is to
be responsive to the needs of a wide range of
users, it must recognise its clientele, be aware of
its needs and tailor its services accordingly. In
fact, a god statistial agency must readily
provide answers to questions like what, how
and when, the data serials are produced and
how and when they are made available to the
users.
In the past, the basic function of official
statistics in the majority of the developing
countries was to support planning and decision
making activities of the Gwemrnent The
situation has now undergone several changes.
New usersa groups haw emer~ed, and as a
result, statistical agencies are required to
MSllWC &dWn d tnf Tedvld, 1998,18[4)

determine the demand and optimize the data
processing and dissemination
procedures with availah resources.

collection,

In India, the available statistical material
remains underutilised due to the possessive
attitude of statistical agencies. This inward
looking attitude of the agencies needs to be
replaced by a spirit of openness and
collaboration. Data collected by lhese
organisations should be available on request to
Indian.universities and research institutions as a
matter of national policy'6.

The advent of information technology has
prwided new opportunity to statistial
agencies. Now one can find market for statistics
even in industry and business sector, with
repackaged information tailored to the needs of
the users. Many of the source agencies have
lately started using computers for the
maintenance and updation of databases. A few
of them have started undertaking special
tabulation as per requirements of users. These
efforts need to be augmented using modern
electronic media such as CD-ROM, etc., for
data dissemination.
