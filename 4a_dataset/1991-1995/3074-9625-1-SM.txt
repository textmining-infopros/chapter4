Abstract
Describes in detail CD-ROM systems, databases and CD NET
networking system available at DESIDOC. Advantages a n d
disadvantages of online and CD databases are compared. Problems
faced in acquisition, installation of various databases; and retrieval
software problems of major CD database producers are also discussed.

1. Introduction
CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only Memory) is a rehtively new technology. First announced in 1983, it became commercially
available since 1985. The library represents
one of the largest markets for this technology.
Its usefulness in libraries is not only limited to
developed countries, but also of great advantage to libraries in developing countries where
telecommunication services for connection to
online databases are very expensive and unreliable. CD-ROMs can be used as a substitute to online searching and even to build up
customised databases.

addition to high storage capacity, it facilitates
end user searching and saves information
retrieval time, besides offering safety of data.
The search software is flexible and relatively straight forward to use. All features like
field searching, word adjacency, search truncation, sorting, etc are available with the CDROM retrieval software.

3. CD-ROM vs Online Searching

A CD-ROM disc, which can store up to 660
MB of information or 260,000pages of text, is
user-friendly and requires less floor space. In

Menu driven approach with CD-ROM is
more user friendly than command driven approach of all online services. Therefore, the
searcher is not under pressure to complete the
session as quickly as possible, even though
menu-driven software is slower than the command-driven software. In online services,
costs normally increase with the usage of
database while in CD-ROM, once installed, it
can be used without further incremental costs.

Another advantage with CD-ROM is its
graphic capability. Diagrams, graphs, tables,
maps, illustrations, etc, can be reproduced on
screen as well as on printer whereas online
services currently support textual information
only.
Biggest disadvantage with CD databases
is the frequency of updation. For example,
Dissertation Abstracts Online is updated
monthly whereas Dissertation Abstracts on
Disc is updated only annually; Humanities Index is updated twice per week for online but
only quarterly on CD-ROM. This is because of
the production of master discs, their replication and mailing to subscribers is an expensive
and time consuming process.

als for different databases whereas online
vendors adopt Common Command Language
(CCL) for searching all databases.

4. CD-ROM Facility at DESIDOC
DESIDOC ha's Philips CM 110 system
which works as a stand-alone CD workstation.
A CD networking system is currently under
implementation at the Defence Science Library of DESIDOC.
4.1 Hardware

Detailed hardware configuration of CDROM network is given in fig. 1.

4.2 Software
The software falls into three categories:

For retrospective searching, online is the
only alternative, because major databases are
available from 1966 onwards; whereas CD
databases are available from 1980 onwards.
All CD databases do not use the same search
software, atleast 70 different kinds of software are currently in use. As a result, it is
difficult for the user to refer to different manu-

tions. It also features dynamic DOSdrive-letter-assignment to remotely networked CD-ROMs and system overview
facility.
CD NET Software consists of two primary
components: The central CD Net Server, and
the CD Net Workstation. CD Net Server is a
CD- ROM 'data service' network server, providing dedicated CD-ROM data service to MSDOS user workstations on LAN. Each CD Net
Server node attaches to the LAN as a 'peer'
node, and is completely independent of any
network file server. CD-Net Workstation software gives access to each MS-DOS workstation on the LAN and to the CD Net Server
CD-ROMs.
CD Net Workstation Software includes Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM Extensions ver
2.20 (MSCDEX); Meridian CD Net MSCDEX
Network Device Driver; Menu and command
line utilities; CD-ROM Network Application
Management System; CD-Menu; CD-Admin;
and Remote CD Net Server Status Tools.
4.3 Cost
The subscription prices for CD-ROM products are the same regardless of networking.
However, for networking the products, user
has to give network licence fee depending
upon the number of workstations.
4.4 Advantages of CD Networking
(i) The network supports simultaneous use
of the same product.
(ii) As the CD-ROMs are permanently
mounted, the users only have to select
from a menu, rather than individually collecting and installing discs.
(iii) Security can also be improved as the
CD-ROMs can be permanently mounted
and kept in non-public area.

5. Limitations of Access Software
5.1 Applied Science and Technology
lndex (AS&TI)
(i) In AS&TI software no option is available
for limiting the search on a specific range of

publication years. For example, the problem
of searching the articles on radar, published
specifically from 1980-1984 cannot be solved.
(ii) In many cases wrong citations were
noticed, in particular, wrong pagination was
found when actual source journals were referred.
(iii) Basic lndex is available through
Browse option and is based on keywordsldescriptors. Terms from title words, keywords,
subject headings, journal names, etc can be
searched in other modes like Wilsearch and
Wilsearch Online. For exhaustive search, Wilsearch mode provides optimum results.
5.2 INSPEC On Disc
Proquest Software ver 3.3 is very fast as
compared to its earlier two versions. Using this
software exhaustive searching through free
terms, descriptors, authors, chemical formulae, document type, INSPEC classification
code etc is possible. An extremely useful
option of INSPEC Thesaurus is also available
with this database.
Printing is possible in two modes: long
output (complete record), and short output
(citations).
For a particular search selective fields can
neitber be displayed nor printed.
5.3 Silver Platter Retrieval Software
System (SPIRS)
SPIRS is very exhaustive. All features like
Help; Browse; Index; Display or Print (citations, full record, selective fields); Exchange;
and Search History are included. Wild Card
searching on various fields viz Author, Title
words, Year, NTlS Accession Numbers etc is
possible. In addition, Boolean logical and relational operators can be used for refining the
search.
Inadequate/inconsistent indexing is seen
in all databases which directly affects the
retrieval performance. For multi- termlcompound words like carbon carbon composites,
following variations were found in NTlS database:

6. Problems of Access Software
6.1 Acquisition Problems

Documentation/original installation software floppies were not supplied in some cases
when ordered through local vendors while CD
producers are prompt in providing necessary
documentation and technical support.

the CD update we noticed that some sectors
were not readable and therefore, that CD database had to be replaced.
6.2 Software Installation Problems

Retrieval software is not standardised for

aH CD databases.
Retrieval software version changes with
every update disc.
For installation of Bowker databases, viz.
Ulrich Plus, and Books in Print, specific
device driver name has to be given separately in CONFIG.SYS (system file) depending upon the make and model of CDROM drive while other CD databases support MS DOS extension software.
Recent trend is to have the installation
software on CD to avoid virus problems.

Few database publishers like Silver Platter
and Dialog insist on returning old discs after
the updated disc has been received. In case
where user fails to renew his subscri~tion,he
has to return the disc as per the agreement.

7. Users Response and
Downloading

CD databases should be checked up by
validation program because some may have
manufacturing defects. For example in one of

Users who are aware of basic computer
commands can do searching themselves.
Downloading of data on floppies is not all-

owed. Most of the CD-ROMs allow downloading of text on floppy discs. However, in order
to protect the network from computer viruses,
users are not discouraged from downloading
data on their floppies. Several barriers like
physical or software lock, on the workstation
floppy disk drives, use of pre-checked disks
etc are employed to avoid virus problems. This
is not of course fool proof but it has kept the
problem within reasonable limits.
