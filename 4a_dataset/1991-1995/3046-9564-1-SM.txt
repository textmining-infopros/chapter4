Abstract
A technique for automatic logon to Dialog host computer
at Palo Alto, California, USA, is described. The software,
written in Procomm Script language, helps in connecting
to the Gateway Packet Switching Service PAD at New
Delhi provided by the Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited.
After connecting to the PAD, the software sends NUI,
User No., Password and loads up the search strategy. The
software with automatic option selection capability, can
be learnt by librarians with minimum effort.

1. Introduction

1

Due to the continued devaluation of
Indian rupee and rising cost of databases and
telecommunications, it is necessary to cope
up with the resulting problems by adopting
novel techniques for searching the databases
online. One of the factors which affect the
search cost is the manual typing of
commands from the keyboard. Besides,
accessing the databases through Gateway
Packet Switching Service (GPSS) without
having leased lines up to local PADS poses
connectivity problems, mainly due to the fact
that a large number of subscribers are served
by only a few ports. For example, in Delhi,
only four telephone lines are provided by
Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL) for
about 150 registered users. The users lose
interest when they do not get a clear line
even after repetitive manual dialing.

Besides, in the process, they waste their
valuable time.
The above factors inspired us to find a
solution in providing necessary relief to the
user from the process of repetitive dialing
and also in using the telephone line
effectively after getting the connection. The
Script file, written in Procomm Script
language, saves time and reduces the
telecommunication and search costs besides
minimizing the errors (Fig. 1).

2. Procomm Script Language
In India, Procomm software is supplied
along with the modem at a nominal price of
Rs 500 by various modem manufacturers.
Sometimes, it is given free of cost. One of
the special features of the Procomm software
is its script language. For those who are
unfamiliar with script language, these may

be taken as mini-programs that take care of
the control of the functioning of their
computer and modem from the point of
dialing through the logon process, and also
of their automatic movement in an online
system from one database to another for

searching, once they entered an information
retrieval system such as Dialog. The
publishers of Procomm have done a
commendable job of making COMMANDS
accessible to anyone willing to learn the
language.

then these t h ~ e eare transmitted (lines 91 to
125). In case of any failure in transmission
or when the NUI, user number and password
are not accepted by the host/PAD. the
control is passed on to line 51 and the next
available number is tried.

Figure 1 gives a complete picture of the
commands that a Script file uses. It begins
with a few lines of comments. Comments
must be started with semicolons. After
comments, the first six lines set the terminal
speed. parity, etc. Line number 16 positions
the cursor on the 4th row and 5th column
for the message in line 17. This message asks
the user to specify the file name where the
retrieved data will be stored on the hard disk.
In case the file name is not specified, the
key <ENTER> is pressed and the default
file name PROCOMM.LOG is assumed. We
recommend to rename this file and then
delete it after a search is over. Between lines
28 to 30, three variab!es are defined. In
variable S2, the number to be dialed first is
defined, preceded by ATDP. If the user
wants to change telephone numbers, the
Script file is updated by replacing the old file
with a new one, using any text editor.
Lines 31 to 49 display some message on
the screen and dial the number given in line
28. If no connection is made, lines 51 to 70
are executed which determine the number
to be dialled next. The process is repeated
until the session is aborted or the connectian
is established. Modifications can be made
wherever necessary in the lines 51 to 70 by
replacing the existing telephone numbers
with new ones. The digits ( 4 ) ,coming after
ATDP are required only when the telephone
line is through EPABXd a d is not a direct
dial up line.

After transmitting the password
successfully, the Script waits up to 60 s for
Dialog prompt "?". The monient Dialog
prompt is received, the Script checks the
DIALOG.KEY file where the Dialog
commands and search strategy are stored. If
it iS not found, further execution of
commands is terminated 'and the Script
returns to terminal mode, and one .can
continue the session manually.
The DIALOG.KEY file can be changed
by pressing ALT-M key from the terminal
mode or the Help Screen. A window will
appear listing the current key assignments
(Fig. 2). T o revise an assignment the key
"R" is pressed, followed by the key to assign

In case the connection is established,
the line 73 instructs the program to wait for
20 s for "*" (PAD prompt). If "*"is received
within the specified time limit, the line 79
will open a file for downloading information.
The next ten lines determine whether the
file NETWORK.KEY (where the NUI, user

(ALT-0 through ALT-9). A group of macros
thus created is saved on to disk by using the
"S" option. When Procomm prompts for a
file name, the name of the file is given for
saving the macro. The use of a file extension
'.KEY' helps in distinguishing the nature of
contents. In case the file name is not

In case the file specified by the user in
line 137 is found on the disk, line 149 sounds
alarm five times to alert the user about the
beginning of the database search. The
subsequent 20 statements of the program
wait for the prompts to be sent by the host
system and for answering them with proper
responses.
Finally, when the program ends, the
Script closes the logged file and returns to
the terminal mode. In case the search
strategy requires more than 10 macros, one
can have more than one .KEY files. These
can be loaded in the same way as
DIALOG.KEY and macros can be
transmitted after inserting requisite lines
between lines 169 and 170.

before the actual search begins. However,
in actual case as many macro files can be
created as the situation demands.

The result of the search conducted on
Dialog System through GPSS (Delhi PAD)
using Script file AUTODIAL.CMD, is given
in Appendix 'A'. Only one search statement
macro 6 was used in this example to keep
the cost of the experiment to a bare minimum
(Fig. 2). Besides, some other search
parameters, such as Set Cost Short,
LimitalVEng, Set Select Short, are to be set

5. Conclusion
The success of this method depends on
the efficacy and efficiency of the search
strategy. However, in case of zero results in
response to the search statements executed,
the Script file* should be terminated by
pressing ESC key.

Abstract: Describes a dialogue-based system which is intended as an intelligent natural
language interface to the French Yellow Pages. The authors do not assume that the user
knows how the Yellow pages are organized, and they paraphrase his request, if necessary, so
as to better search for the desired information. Itis assumed that the reason the user is online
is to find addresses and phone numbers of suppliers. There are three basic modules used in
the system: parser, dialogue manager, and generator. The first two exist (and are constantly
being extended), while the generation module is still only a set of functional specifications.
