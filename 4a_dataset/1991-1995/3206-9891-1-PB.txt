Abstract
This article presents the basics of lnternet and its benefits to the users
who want to avail the opportunities offered by the net in simplified
questionnaire form. The text lists out various login sites of interest to
information professiorkls, librarians and documentalists.

However hackneyed it might sound, we
are in the midst of the information
revolution and the lnternet is the force that
is driving this revolution. The lnternet is a
network of literally millions of computers in
over 75 nations and accessed by millions of
users. It is estimated that every month two
million new users try the lnternet [I]. While
a majority of the machines use the lnternet
as a communication medium, a good
percentage of them are information service
providers.
At present, information on the lnternet
i s stored in a haphazard, relatively
unstructured manner thus making the
access to information tedious, and a hit or

miss proposition. Jacobson [2] compares
the lnternet to a large rapidly growing
library where the books have been placed
randomly on the shelves and have no call
numbers or other classification schemes
and with new collections being added
every day. Hence, i t is important that
librarians understand and exploit this
information resource which is literally
swamping the world with electronic data
and information. Of particular interest to
librarians i s the problem of citing electronic
documents. Standards are being developed
for this. Another area of interest i s of
cataloguing lnternet resources. The OCLC
has
brought
out
a
manual
for
cataloguing lnternet resources. This manual
was developed to aid those participating in

the OCLC/US Department of Education
funded project 'Building a Catalogue of
A
searchable
Internet Resources'.
catalogue of lnternet resources called
the intercat will be available at URL
http://w.ocIc.org:6990 till March 1996.
It is essential, therefore, for library and
information workers to actively participate
in this revolution and not just be carried
along with the tide. For this, it is necessary
to know about the internet and how to
effectively utilise this vast 'comparatively
unorganised' library.
In this paper, we provide information
that will be useful to the instructors. We
have selected only what we consider as the
core information that every user of lnternet
should know. At a minimum, the students
should be able to use the lnternet to send
and receive electronic mail, telnet to
remote sites, search for files using a search
program such as Archie, and retrieve files
using ftp. Although the World Wide Web
with its hypertext technology will make
searching and retrieval easier, not all
documents are available on the Web and
the primitive methods are still necessary.
However, we feel that the students shouid
be introduced to the Web and strongly
encouraged to browse through the Web.
We have indicated some interesting sites to
visit on the network. The instructor may add
additional sites and also make it a
requirement for the students to atleast visit
a few and retrieve information from them.

One final note to the instructors:
Teaching' lnternet is more like teaching
swimming or bicycling. There is not much
of theory to teach and the students learn
only by doing. It is therefore important to
ensure that the students are given adequate
computer time and the course be taught in
a laboratory setting (with an lnternet
connected computer).

2. INSTRUnIONAL MODULES
2.1 Preliminaries and Pact-requisites

FAQ stands for Frequently Asked
Questions. Most tutorial and instructional
materials on the internet are often in the
form of questions and answers and the
documents are often called FAQs. The
name of the documents often have the
extension .faq or XAQ.
2.1.2 What is JInfemel?
internet is a backbone connecting
networks of computers. Typically, one
machine in each network, usually called the
gateway machine, is connected to the
Internet.
2.1.3 Who regulates the Internet?

Nobody? lnternet is an unregulated
network. Any machine that follows the
lnternet Protocol (1P) can be on the
network. Each machine on the network is
given a unique lnternet address. Most users
access the lnternet through an lnternet
Service Provider (ISP) who has a machine
on the Internet. Currently, in India, the three
providers are the Educational and Research
Network of the Department of Electronics
(ERNET), Vidhesh Sanchar Nigam Limited
(QSNL) and the Software Technoiogy Parks
of India (STPI). O f the three, only QSNL is
available to the general public.
2.1.4 What is an internet Service
Provider?
lnternet Service Provider (ISP) gives you
an account on a machine that i s connected
to the Internet. You log on to the machine
and access the lnternet from there. Most of
the users will connect to the machine using
modems and telephone lines. Dedicated
users may have round the clock
connections using leased telephone line
DESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Technd,1495,15(6)

connections, or radio iinks or even satellite
links to the provider.

2.1.5 I have a PC and a Modem. Can I
place nty machine on the Internet?
Generally, you use your PC as a terminal
to the machine provided by the [SP.
However, if your ISP provides the right
access to you, you connect to the ISP using
either PPP or SLIP connections (you use
specialised software to do this). Once you
are connected and the connection i s
authenticated, the ISP will provide your
machine with a temporary lnternet address.
At this stage, your computer is physically a
part of the Internet. Your machine will be
on the network till you disconnect, at which
time the temporary address is returned to
the pool that is maintained by the ISP. This
address will be assigned by the ISP to the
next machine that connects using the

SLIP/PPP.
lalor all lSPs provide SLIP/PPP
connections and those that do may not
extend this privilege to all their clients.
Service providers call the clients who are
permitted SLIP/PPP connection as TCP/IP
accounts,

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
refers to the manner in which the control is
transferred from one machine to the other
(in this case the service provider and your
machine). IP stands for lnternet Protocol,
the protocol that should be followed by any
machine that wants to communicate on the
lnternet Programs running on personal
computers that allow the PC to use TCP/tP
are often referred to as TCP/IP stacks.
2.1.7 What is the history of Internet?

The origin of the lnternet can be traced
to the ARPANET. ARPANET was a network
created by the Advanced Research Projects
Agency, the US Department of Defence

Organisation, This network linked
researchers in various organisations and
enabled them to share resources and
information. This network split into two
one for military use and the other for
civilian purposes. The interconnection
between them came to be known as the
lnternet. Other networks such as the
BITNR; CSNR; NSFNET, JANET to name a
few were developed and connected with
the Internet, thus making it a huge network
of computers,

-

2.1,8 What took and equipment da H
need to access Internet?

A PC, modem, communication software
and a computer account on a machine
connected to the Internet. If the access to
the lnternet is text based, any simple PC
with modem speed of 2400 baud rate is
adequate. However, if you are interested in
graphics and sound, you need a PC with
processor comparable to or better than
Intel 386 chip and modems with speed of
9600 baud. if you are interested in a
SLIP/PPP connection, you would need the
appropriate software. intensive users of the
lnternet should have a (Unix) workstation
directly connected to the network on high
speed link,

2.1.9 What pre-requisite (Background)
knowledge do I need to use
Internet?
You need to know: How to use a PC and
the communication programme and how
to log on to the machine on which you
have the account. If you plan to transfer
files between your PC and the machine on
the lnternet you should become familiar
with the file transfer programmes that
comes with the communication software.
Kermit, Xmodem, Ymodem and Zmodem
are some of the widely used file transfer
programmes.
19

2.1.10 M a t is available 'en #heInternet?
1. Free software developed at various
universities and research organisations.
2. Free software developed by individuals
and placed on the lnternet for general
use.

sofware.

Archie and gopher, there are several other
search tools such as veronica, wais, etc.

2.2 E-Mail, Electronic journals,
Bulletin Boards and Discussion Lists

22.1 What is e-maiR
Electronic mail or e-mail as it is popularly
known is the electronic equivalent of the
normal postal system. E-mail permits the
transmission of text in machine-readable
form from one computer system to another
where it is stored in the recipient" mailbox.
Every e-mail consists 05 atleast four
elements :
a) the address of the recipient,
b) the address of the sender,
c) a subject line and
d) the letter/message.

12. Newspapers.

2.2.2 What is in an entail address?

13. Electronic shopping malls.

The e-mail address consists of your id
and the name of the machine on which you
have your account. For example,
nviiay@giarrndOI.vsnl.netin would be the
email address of the user nvijay whose
account i s on the machine called
giasmdo 1.vsnl.netin.
The
format
is
userid@hostsubdomain.firstleveldomain. The
address is in several parts, each of which is
separated by a period. The first part is the
name of the machine, the subdomain
indicates the location of the machine and
the network and the first level domain
indicates the country, and if in the US, the
type of organisation. The system used by
the lnternet to assign addresses to
computers on the network is known as the
Domain Name System (DNS).

2.1.11 What is Shareware/Crippleware?
Shareware is a form of distributing
commercial software. Typically you are
given 30 to 40 days to try it out and at the
end of the period you are expected to pay
for the software if interested or delete it
from your machine. Crippleware is a form
of commercial software where certain key
features are inactivated. This allows you to
try the software before buying it.

2.1.I2What facilities are available for
searching the Internet?

if you know the name of the file, you
can use Archie to locate the file. In most
cases it is enough if you can specify the
name of the file using wild cards. Gopher is
a menu driven search tool that also locates
files. Even if the computer you use does not
provide these services, you can telnet to the
sites that do provide them (telnet is
described in a later module). In addition to

2.2.3 How are machines identified on

the Internet?
Computers on the lnternet can be
identified either by names as described
above or by numbers. The number consists

Often, you may have account on more
than one machine which may not be
geographically close. Telnet permits you to
work on more than one machine. This is
especially useful for collaborative work.
Also, certain facilities may not be available
in your local machine but only on some
remote machine. As long as you have login
privileges on the remote machine, you can
make use of these facilities. Some machines
might only provide restricted access to
them for anyone. For example, you will
telnet to a site that has an Archie server and
login with the user id Archie to make use of
the Archie service,
2.3.3 What is Archie?

Archie started out as an archive of files
available to general public. Over the years,
Archie has become a powerful search tool
to locate publicly available files. You use
Archie by connecting to an Archie site and
running the Archie program.
2.3.4 How do I connect to an Archie site?

You telnet to an Archie site and login as
Archie, Once you are logged in, the
computer will automatically start the Archie
program. Note that most Archie sites will
not allow you to do anything beyond
running the program.

2.3.5 Can you name some Archie sites?

Fik using Archie P
Once you have Archie running, use the
command find followed by the file name,
You can use wild cards in the search. You
can also use what is called a substring
search in which the pattern you use for the
file name will be matched with any file that
has the pattern as a substring. Generally,
only the first 99 files that match the pattern
would be shown, but this number can be
changed. Also, i f p u want a more
permanent record of the search results, you
can issue the command mail to followed by
your e-mail address. In this case, the resu!ts
of the search will also be mailed to you by
e-mail.

2.3.7 Now that Iknow Where the fjle is,
and How E/O 1 get if?
To get the file you need to use the
program called ftp.

2.4 ftp and File Transfer
2.4.1 What is ftp?
File Transfer Protocol (Pt) i s an
application that permits the transfer of files
between two computers. Typically, you run
the program on one computer and open a
connection to the other computer. When
establishing the connection, you need to
login to the other computer using a valid
userid and the corresponding password.
Once, the connection is established, you
can transfer files from your local machine
using the put command and retrieve files
from the remote machine using the get
command. You retrieve most of the public
documents that are available on the
internet using 'anonymous' ftp.
2.4.2 How do I connect to an
anonymous ftp site?

Anonymous ftp sites are computer sites
which have public files. These files can be
accessed by anyone. You do not have to be
DESDOC BdeM of Inf T ~ c W 1995.15(6)
,

a registered user to access these files.
When you use anonymous ftp, you login as
anonymous once you are connected to the
ftp site. The password generally used is
one's own e-mail address.
2.4.3 How do I put files for the use of
others?
Some anonymous ftp sites will permit
you to put files on their system. You can
select one such site and place your
documents there. Your file can now be
used by others. It is also important to note
that most anonymous ftp sites mirror other
sites also; i.e., they hill keep copies of files
found in the site being mirrored. Thus, once
you place the file on a site, it may be
duplicated at several sites.

2.5 World Wide Web
2.5.1 Whatis WWW?
The World Wide Web, more commonly
known as the Web or WWW, is a network
of WWW servers that use the lnternet as
the backbone. The Web started as a small,
hypertext-based network of documents. The
documents themselves were distributed
over several machines on the Internet,
connected to each other through hypertext
links. Although it started as a tool for
researchers to exchange information, many
organisations joined by adding documents
to this network and providing links to these
documents. At present, the Web is truly
world wide with Web documents literally
spanning the globe.
2.5.2 What are Hypertext and
Hypermedia?
Hypertext is a document which permit
'non-linear' access to information. The
documents contain programmed 'links' to
other documents and selecting the link
results in the display of the linked
document. The 'path' that you follow in a
hypertext document is determined entirely
DESIDOC BulleNn of Inf Technol,1995,15(6)

by you. This is in contrast to the
conventional documents which follow a
'linear' structure. Hypermedia refers to
hypertext documents which in addition to
text contain graphics, video and sound. The
pages on the Web are hypertext documents
as they contain links to other documents.
What makes the Web truly world wide is
that the documents could be anywhere in
the world and are known to each other
through their URL.
2.5.3 What is an URL?
Every document on the internet has an
unique identifier called the URL (Uniform
Resource Locator). URLs contain three
parts-the type of protocol that is used to
fetch the document, followed by the
computer site where the document. is
stored, followed by the directory path on
the computer to the actual document. The
last piece of the URL is likely to be the file
name. For example, the URL http:
//www.3w.com/3w/index.html locates file
called index.htmi in the directory 3w on the
machine www.3w.com. The initial section
http: indicates that this document should be
fetched using hypertext transfer protocol.
Also, the suffix html in the file name
indicates that it is a HTML document.
2.5.4 What is HTTP?
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
defines h o w hypermedia files get
transferred from the WWW servers to your
computer. A computer that stores and
transmits WWW documents has a software
called HTTP server. Browsers on your
computer have HTTP client software built'in
so that you can display these documents on
your computer.
2.5.5 What is HTML?
If you want to put your information on
the WWW you will need to use the
Hypertext Mark-up Language or HTML.
Every Web page is an HTML document. An
23

HTML document consists of text and HTML
codes which define how the text will look.
If you want to create your pages on the
Web you will need to know HTML or
procure a program that generates HTML
files.
2.5.6 How to retrieve information from
the Web?
To access information on the Web, you
need a special program called the browser.
The browser has the ability to render HTML
documents and also follow links embedded
in these documents. You start the session at
a special document called the Homepage.
Depending on the Internet Seivice Provider,
you may or may not be able to choose the
homepage you want to start with. Starting
from your page, you follow the links, from
one document to another until you get the
information you need. Some URCs will have
fp in the place of http as the protocol to be
used to access the document. In such
cases, the browser will automatically invoke
fp and transfer the file to your computer.

2.5.9 What are the Browsers avail;ableP

Mosaic, Netscape, Lynx are the most
commonly available browsers. To evaluate
the browsers you should first be clear about
the nature of the information you want to
access (text or graphics or sound or video,
etc.) and the computing power available on
your own system. If you are interested in
multimedia, then you would probably go in
for a multimedia browser such as the
Netscape or Mosaic. if you are only
interested in text, or your resources do not
permit multimedia, then you should
probably choose Lynx. Also, i t is important
to note that the browser that is available is
often dictated by the lnternet Service
Provider.
2.5.10 Can you name some Web
documents of interest?

2.5.7 What is a Homepage?
The Homepage is the starting page that
is displayed when you access the World
Wide Web. The home page is designed to
have links to the various documents on the
site. You can create your own home page
with links 10 the documents you want to
access.

Browsers are programmes which help to
navigate the Web. The browser can be on
your ISP's computer or it can be a
programme that you can install on your PC.
~roivsersare of different types, some of
them do not permit graphics or other media

3. CONCLUSION
The modules presented above deal with
the technical aspects of Internet. There is
another important aspect to lnternet usage
which i s of interest to library and
information workers. This is concerned with
the administrative and management aspect
of use of the lnternet by the organisation.

DESIDOC Bulleth of lnf T & c h d , 19951M6)

Some of the questions which would
arise in this connection are those dealing
with accounting and budgeting For the use
of the lnternet, the types of facilities to be
provided for the members of the
organisation, whether the library and
information centre should charge for the
services it provides etc. These issues are
necessarily addressed on a case by case
basis.
