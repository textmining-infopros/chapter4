Abstract
This paper attempts to summarise the databases commercially
availabile in lndia to the general public. These may be availabie either
on floppies or as on-line or in CD-ROM format. Some important
vendors with details of the database, coverage, scope, etc. are
discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Database Industry in lndia is of
recent origin, less than 5 years old. Thanks
to the liberalisation process started by the
Government, an awareness about the
importance o f i n f o r m a t i o n as an
indispensable resource for industrial growth
has set in. As a result, corporations are
ready to pay for useful information, if
provided in digestible capsules.
Growth in telecommunication and data
networking facilities coupled with the
onslaught of computers in every sphere of
industrial activity, has paved way for a
variety of information services, like online
services, bulletin boards, value added news
broadcasting services, interactive video and
the like, hitherto unknown to Indian
customers.

2.14 Other Databases
Besides the dozen and odd databases
mentioned earlier, quite a few smail
organisations are silently producing
databases for specialised areas.
(a) lndian Library Association, New Delhi
has a directory of 10,000 libraries and
supplies the same in a set of 10 floppies ( I 0
MB).
(b) Bureau of Indian Standards, New Delhi
has a database of organisations producing
goods as per IS! standard. They also have
details of more than 15,000 indian
standards on magnetic tape made
searchable through INSDOC and NIC
computers.
(c) Electronics For You, Delhi supplies a
database o f Electronic C o m p o n e n t
Suppliers (2,000) on a set of floppies along
with search software in dBASE format.
(d) STQC, Madras has produced a database
of electronic components giving corporate
specifications, and approval details from
BIS, Military Inspectorate, etc.
(e) Result, Delhr produces a fee-based
mailing list for a number of advertising and
market researcil companies.

(0Datarnatics, Bombay offers for one time
use, a large database of eight lakh
addresses (mailing list). It is the only firm in
list business offering to pay back the

(i) Department of Telecom through MTNL,

database of telephone subscribers in New
Delhi, numbering over nine lakhs. The
price of the database will be Rs. 2,000 and

20

It may be seen that almost successful
database producers have concentrated on
the financial information services for the
merchant bankers, investors, investment
consultants and financial analysts. All of
them have years of experience in collecting
and disseminating the information in the
chosen field in print form.

This holds good for $1 Infotech, DART,
Capital Market, CMIE, etc. All of them
started w i t h floppy-based services
expanding to large volume databases and
then to online services. Presently, except
JURIX, and BiSNf3, online database service
stilE means that periodical updates are
available via modem download.

A large number of small entrepreneurs
are entering the fray with highly specialized
databases for niche markets. The next ten
years are bound to witness a steady growth
