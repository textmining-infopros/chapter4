ABSTRACT

This study deals with library automation programme of BAMUL,
Aurangabad. It identifies the problems in the existing system and
gives reasons for automation. The study points out the requirement of
library automation and discusses the technical, social and economic
aspects of library automation in detail.

1. INTRODUCTION
Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada
University Library (BAMUL), established in
1958 at Aurangabad (Maharaslitra), has in
its collection 2,89,895 books and non-book
material, and receives 899 periodical titles.
On an average, the library is open on 245
days in a year, has 2,979 registered users,
and circulation of 56,588 documents. The
library shares its resources with other
university libraries; provides teachers
personal library (TPL) facility, reference and
reprographic services; brings out monthly
documentation list, list of new additions
and occasionally arranges exhibitions.
These services are provided by 68 full
time staff members of which 27 are
professionals. However, 22 posts from nonprofessional category are vacant.
Considering the present work load, BAMUL
needs 110.4 persons as per the UGC
formula (2). During 1993-94, annual budget
DESIDOC Bubtln of Inf TechnoI,lW5,15(2)

for BAMU.L was Rs 65,68,100, of which
53.28% amount was spent on purchase of
books and periodicals.

BAMUL is trying to provide the acquired
information within manageable time to its
users. However, increase in the intake of
students has created greater demand for
library services and performance of each
operation manually, makes it difficult to
provide the .acquired information to users
without loosing their time and tempo.
Moreover, due to paucity of clerical staff,
most of the semi-professional and
professional staff has to perform the routine
clerical operations which increases the unit
cost of each operation. Often, long leave of
professional staff creates backlog in the
work, and hence, rest of the professionals
are engaged in clearing the backlog. In this
situation, it is not possible to maintain
schedule of the services or to introduce
new services, which in turn is leading to
dissatisfaction among the users.

One of the solution to solve these
problems, is library automation. Library
automation is the mechanisation of library
house-keeping operations, predominantly
by computerisation (1).
Due to characteristics like speed,
promptness, huge storage capacity,
accuracy, versatility, diligence, cost
effectiveness, ease i n functioning,
elimination of duplication of work, greater
possibility of manipulation, etc., the
computer can be used as a device to help
the librarian in doing things rapidly, more
economically and efficiently.

OBJECTIVES

The present study was undertaken with a
view to :
Survey the available infrastructure in
BAMUL.
Forecast the social aspect of library
automation.
Identify the tangible and intangible
benefits of the system.

2.1. Areas considered for Automation :
The computerisation of BAMUL would
cover the following operations :
(a)Acquisition: I t includes book
selection, purchase of books including
ordering and accounting, receipt of books,
followup for the unsupplied books,
communication of discrepancies, etc.
(b) Technical : It includes accessioning,
preparation of author, title, classified and
alphabetical subject catalogue, preparation
of spine labels, sending books for binding,
stock verification-checking missing books,
recording of withdrawn books, etc.
(c) Circulation : It includes charging and
discharging of books to users, inter-library
loan, departmental loan, renewals, fine
calculation, sending reminders, compilation
12

of statistics by subject, category of users,
class of students, language of books, type
of material, etc.
(d) Information services : It includes
current awareness service-list of new
additions, current contents from journals,
SDI, location service-local documentation
list, retrospective search, etc.

3. REQUIREMENTS
In all, about 30 data files need to be
created for various operations covered
under study to get the required outputs and
perform desired functions.

3.1. Hardware Requirements
Computerised BAMUL would require
multi-user
system
with
80386
microprocessor, 8 MB core memory
(RAM), one 1.2 MB floppy drive, one tape
drive, one CD drive, six terminals, one 300
MB hard disk, line and dot matrix printers.

3.2. Software requirements
The software required for the system
would be :
Operating system: UNlX version 3.2
W Editors: vi (visual instructors)

Compilers: BASIC and C.

4. FEASlB l LlTY S T U D Y
Considering the requirements, a full
scale feasibility study was undertaken for
testing the possibility of computerisation of
BAMUL. The feasibility study was carried
out under the following three areas :
(a) Technical Feasibility,
(b) Social Feasibility,
(c) Economic Feasibility.

4.1. Technical Feasibility
The Department o f Commerce,
Marathwada University, Aurangabad has a
DESlDOC Bulletinof Inf Techno1,1395,15(2)

computer centre. The hardware available in
the department is Zeus-386, a multi-user
system with 8 MB RAM. The system has
one floppy drive of 360 Kl1.2 MB, two hard
disks of 156 MB each and one hard disk of
300 MB. At a time 32 dumb terminals of
VT100 type can be attached to the system.
One tape drive is attached to the system.

operators, etc. It will also relieve the
existing, professional staff from their routine
clerical activities, so as to enable them to
perform intellectual professional duties
which will need reorganisation of staff. The
reorganisation of professional staff will lead
to job improvement as well as job
satisfaction.

Two types of heavy duty printers-one
line printer with 600 lines per minute and
one dot-matrix printer with 200 characters
per second speed are attached to the
system.

As computerisation will generate the
possibility of additional information
services, such as current awareness service,
selective dissemination of information,
bibliographic services, retrospective
information services etc., the existing one
professional will not be sufficient to provide
these services. In future, the system would
need system analyst, programmers and data
entry operators.

The system has standard software like vi
(visual instructors) and ed (editors),
compilers of BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL
and C language, and UNlX operating
system v 3.2.

For software, it was thought to develop
an in-house package and BAMUL had a
person with basic education in library and
information science coupled with
specialisation in computer programmilng
and also familiar with library operations so
that there can be a complete understanding
of the requirements.

Though there will not be any change in
the qualifications of the existing staff,
except for additional training but in future
appointments, the qualifications for the
different professional posts have to be
changed and specialisation in computer
programming will be a necessary
qualification alopg with basic professional
postgraduate degree. It will lead to higher
pay scales especially for the posts of system
analyst, programmers, etc. than that of the
assistant librarian and senior library assistant
respectively.

This shows, that technically it is feasible
to get the required hardware, software and
a person having complete understanding of
the requirements to develop the software
package

The existing organisational structure will
remain unchanged, except for the addition
of one more subsystem, i.e., computer
system, for which the librarian will be
accountable.

4.2 Social Feasibility

~ i ~ h pay
e r scales and an aptitude to
perform technical and intellectual jobs will
definitely lead to job improvement.

It was possible for the Commerce
Department to provide terminals in the
library, attached to the CPU of commerce
department.

.

Generally computerisation brings fear of
unemployment amongst the existing staff.
The automation of BAMUL will not create
unemployment problems but will create
new job positions, like system manager,
system analyst, programmers and
programme maintenance staff, data entry
DESIDOC Bubtln of Inf Technol,lW5.15(2)

Social cost of the proposed system will
consists of the cost of education and
training, consultation and communication.
For computerisation, each of the existing
staff was consulted for their requirements

and problems they have in the existing
system. At the time of implementation, each
employee w i l l be consulted and
accordingly, in-house education and
training programmes will be arranged for
the existing staff member of the library for
8-10 days duration. However, staff members
who are about to retire within 1-2 years,
may be reluctant to undergo training in use
of computer due to ignorance, fear and
hostility, such persons can be utilised for
manual professional activities, as an
alternative to avoid redundancy payment.

4.3. Economic Feasibility
The economic feasibility study was
carried out under following areas :
Cost of operations of existing systems
Cost of operations
system

of the proposed

Cost of development of the proposed
systems
Benefits of the proposed system.
Cost o f operations o f the existing system :
Financial records, like annual budget,
payrolls, etc. were scrutinised and the
librarian and each section incharge in
BAMUL was interviewed to determine the
manpower cost, material cost, operating
cost, equipment cost, overhead cost, etc.
for calculation of unit cost of each
operations in BAMUL.
The total operational expenditure of the
library on manpower, material overhead,
etc. in 1991-92 was Rs 34,86,963 Table 1.
Cost o f operation o f the proposed
system: The computerised BAMUL system
requires manpower, materials, equipment,
overhead cost, etc. Also, it requires data
preparation and conversion cost,
maintenance cost, site preparation cost, etc.
Of the different cost requirements for
the proposed system, Department of
14

Commerce, BAMUL has invested capital
expenditure while BAMUL has to bear
some capital and incremental cost as per its
requirements.
Table 2 shows items of expenditure and
estimated cost of those items which give
the investment, implementation a;ld
overhead cost of the proposed system.
As BAMUL can share the hardware
facilities with Commerce Department, it has
to bear the cost of monitors and key boards
for terminals. The library requires 10
terminals i n different areas like
acquisition-2, maintenance-1, circulation-2,
reference section for data entry
operations-3, for users-2. UGC has already
given a grant for purchase of one PC/AT
which can be used as terminal. The tape
drive available in Department of Commerce
can be shared by the library. The library
already has one dot Matrix printer, which
can be attached to the computer in
Commerce Department.
The computer based system will require
data entry operators. Till they are
appointed, the operations can be
per'formed by the existing junior library
assistants and typists after giving required
training for data conversion.
For maintenance of hardware and
software, the Commerce Department has
signed a maintenance contract for
Rs 70,000 of which 10% maintenance
expenditure can be shared by the library
which comes to Rs 7,000 per year.
The computer running cost can be
calculated from camputer time used, power
utilised, stationary utilised, etc. It is
estimated to Rs T 7 per computer hour.
For site Preparation, the library need not
have to spend any thing additional on air
conditioning, power, insurance, etc.
DESIDOCBulletin of Inf Technol,1995,15(2)

Table 1. Cost of operations of the existing
system for the year 1991-92.

By using existing staff after training,
sharing with commerce department and
using available hardware there can be
reduction of Rs 2,00,000 in capital cost to
be invested by the library. With the
proposed system, BAMUL has to bear
capital cost of Rs 11,00,000 which is one
time investment and Rs 31,35,000/- as
incremental cost per year.

S.No.

Benefits of the Proposed system: Library
being a non-profit organisation, it is difficult
to measure, tangible benefits of the
proposed system. However, considering the
cost of operations of the existing system in
1991-92 is Rs 34,86,963 as shown in
Table 1. The expenditure incurred by the
library in 1993-94 on items other than
books and periodicals was Rs 30,68,100.
The cost of operations of the proposed
system consists of capital cost of
Rs 11,00,000 and incremental cost of
Rs 31,35,000. i t can be said that since the
capital cost of Rs 11,Q0,000 will be one
time investment, the operations cost of
proposed system will. be less than that of
existing system which shows net cost
reduction by Rs 3,51,963. This includes cost
of manpower, material, equipment and
overheads.
At the same time, financial resources can
be generated by the library for providing

Total

Cost of development of the proposed
system: Considering the stages of
development of a system, attempts were
made to calculate development cost of the
proposed system.
The system development cost is once
only cost. It required 3360 man-hours i.e.
480 working days (1 year 4 months) for
system development. Hence the system
development cost required was Rs 1,37,000
as salary and Rs 5,000 for stationary. The
total system development cost was
Rs 1,42,000.

Item

selective dissemination of information (SDI)
and bibliographic services, so as to make
the system cost beneficial.
Apart from these, the following can be
the intangible benefits of the proposed
system :
IFaster response time and accuracy in
providing information can improve the
quality of library services
?

Availability of statistical information from
the system which can lead to effective
decision making and elimination of
wastage

@ Saving of future expenditure in collection
development because of possibility of
sharing resources with other libraries by
linking through INFLIBNm
Provision of new information services like
current awareness service, selective
dissemination
of
information,
retrospective search, etc.
The library has to spend Rs 11,00,000 as
capital cost, which is one time investment.
It is cost effective to the extent of services
provided by the proposed system.
The c'ustomers will accept the system, as
it will provide them required information
without loosing their time and tempo. The
employees can happily accept it as their
friend to supplement their job and improve
their status.

5. CONCLUSION

shows that library automation in BAMUL is
feasible socially.

Library automation is the need of the
day. However, one has to think of the
investment, its technical and social aspects.

The operational cost of the proposed
system is less than that of existing system
which includes manpower, material
equipment and overhead cost. At the same
time, the system will be able to generate
financial resources to make the system cost
beneficial along with many intangible
benefits, hence economicallt library
automaton is feasible.

Technically it is feasible to get the
required hardware, software and person
having complete understanding of the
requirements to develop software package.
Automation will create new job
opportunities h t h higher scales and relieve
the existing professional staff from their
routine clerical activities to enable them to
perform intellectual professional duties. The
reorganisation of professional staff will lead
to job satisfaction. The social cost of
proposed system will be only the training
cost of library personnel for 8-10 days. It
