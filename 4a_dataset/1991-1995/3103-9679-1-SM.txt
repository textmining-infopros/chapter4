ABSTRACT
This paper outlines various features of the acquisition module of
Sanjay, an augmented CDS/ISIS ver 2.3 software package. It briefly
describes the activities which are carried out using this software at
Defence Science Library. It also suggests some features that need to
be provided for book acquisition processing.

1. INTRODUCTION
Defence Science Library (DSL) is a
central agency for providing scientific and
technical information to all DRDO
labs/estts. To cater for the day to day needs
of DRDO scientists for their research work,
DSL at Defence Scientific lnformation and
Documentation Centre is holding a rich
collection of books and non-book
documents. To efficiently develop and
manage its collection in an organised way,
DSL has automated library acquisition
activities which include acquisition,
cataloguing, circulation and serials control.
Acquisition activities in DSL have been
automated using 'Sanjay', a software based
DESrDoC Bulktin of hf T e c h 4 1994,14(4)

on CDS/ISIS. The software package
CDS/ISIS has been developed and
distributed free of cost to non-profit
organisations by Unesco (PGI). Designed
and used for the management of structured
non-numerical databases, the package
combines features o f Unesco's
Computerised Documentation System
(CDS) and the Integrated Set of Information
Systems (ISIS) and is efficient to store,
retrieve, display and print information.
Micro CDS/ISIS is basically a package
for information storage and retrieval and is
not capable of handling many library
management activities (viz acquisition,
circulation, financial control) in an
integrated manner. To overcome the

limitations of Micro CDS/ISIS, Sanjay has
been developed by NISSAT in coordination
with DESIDO~.Sanjay enhances the
capabilities of CDS/ISIS by interfacing
about 35 Pascal programs and 25 special
user-friendly menus. Sanjay as an
augmented package, has the following
special features in addition to the database
management applications already available
in CDS/ISIS package.
The package is capable of handling nitmerical operations like calculation of
budgetary allocations and expenditure.
It prwides linking of two or more databases for a single application, like linking
an acquisition system with the online
catalogue and circulation system.

The inverted files are updated automatically whenever a change is made in the
database. For this purpose, the user is not
required to use the inverted file service.

o New menus can be inserted in between
the existing menus without affecting
their functions.

2. BOOK ACQUISITION
PROCESSING AT DSL
The activities in book acquisition at DSL
involve sending information about new
publications to readers, getting indents
from them, placing the details of new
indents to Book SelectionCommittee (BSC)
placing orders and reminders to vendors,
processing of bills and keeping track of the
budget position. DESIDOC also procures
books for other labs from separate budget
allocations.
Manual processing of the new indents
requires repeated inputting of bibliographic details for generating lists for BSC,
list of selected books, budget status reports,
order and reminders to vendors and
processing of bills for payment For online
catalogue of books, the data on acquired

books is to be inpuked in the required
format. The same data is also required for
generation of acquisition lists and catalogue

cards.
To avoid frequent inputting of data and
generation of various reports and forms, the
acquisition activities were automated.
Sanjay packagewas chosen for automation,
because of its suitability for menudriven
information storage and retrieval system,
linking of various related databases,
handling of numerical data for budget and
expenditure, and also as DESIDOC has
been involved in its development
Availability of the acquisition data in
machine-readable form has lead to quick
updation of online catalogue at DESIDOC
by exporting this data in required format
using a conversion program. The flexible
printingoptions of the package facilitate the
generation of reports and lists in desired
form.

3. SYSTEM FEATURES
The foUowing hardware and software
configuration is required for operating
Sanjay.
(i) PC AT with 1 MB RAM, 40 MB Hard Disk
and one floppy drive.
(ii) Printer
(ii) MS-DOS 3.2 or above
(iii) CDS/ISIS ver 2.3
At Defence Science Library, version 1.0
of SANJAY. package (based on CDS/ISIS
ver 2.3) has been loaded. on a PC/AT
computer and the acquisition control
module of the software is being used for the
management of acquisition activities.
The following databases are being used
with the acquisition module of 'SANJAY'.

The structure of these databases is given in
Appendix I.
(i) Acquis database: It contains bibliographic details of the documents to be procured, along with the details of indentors,
vendor codes, and Book Selection Committee number (Table 1).

using
different
worksheets
in

(a) New indents: First l e d of data entry is
done in 'New Indents' worksheet This includes both the indents received from
DRDO scientists plus bod<s taken on a p
proval from vendors (Worksheet 11.
Monthly list of indents is generated at this
stage for consideration and approval of the
BSC which meets every month.
(b) BSC decision: After the Committee has
screened the list for approval, entries with
the details of vendor, supply due-date, a p
proval status etc. are added in 'BSC Decision' worksheet (Worksheet 2).

Using this option, acquisition data is
exported and merged i n the online
catalogue. As a by-product of this data, a
Monthly List o f Additions to Defence
Science Library is being generated. Steps
involved in this process are shown in Fig. 5.

8. SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING

THE ACQUlSmON MODULE
Acquisition module of Sanjay package
(Ver 1.0) has been found quite efficient in
managing the acquisition activities of
Defence Science Library. Adequate help
messages have been provided at all the
stages of data entry. But i t is nqt possible to
link the acquis and bill files; therefore bill
processing job could not be simplified
further. The need for a few help messages
such as symbols for truncation and Boolean
expressions has also been felt in the search
module.
Facilities for information queries such as
the consolidated list of orders pendingwith
a vendor, listing of aH indents by a person
with their status, total expenditure of a
particular BSC should also be provided in
the package. These may be incorporated in
the future version of the Sanjay package.

years. The use of this package has resulted
in reducing the effortsand time required for
acquisition processing and generation of
status reports at different stages. The same
data is available for merging into the online
catalogue database and generating
monthly list of acquisitions.
The software has been able to fulfil
majority o f the requirements of the
acquisition control in Defence Science
Library. However, there is a scope for further
improvement of the software.
