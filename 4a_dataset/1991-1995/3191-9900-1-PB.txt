Abstract
Electronic bulletin board systems are vital tools for
computer-mediated communication among computer users. These
are similar to the bulletin boards that are displayed in a library.
However, these are operated electronically on computer networks.
This article gives an overview about electronic BBSs, the infrastructure
required to set up BBS, and their applications in general. An attempt
has also been made to design an Indian Bulletin Board System for
tibraries, a conceptual BBS on which different types of information
could be organised and a number of services could be provided to
the users.

1. INTRODUCTION

2. WHAT IS A BBS?

Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) started in
the late 70s, as a means of communication
for virtual community existing in
Cyberspace where participants
usually
under pseudonames may send and receive
public and private messages to each other
on any topic, transfer software, play online
games, etc. Ward Christensen and Randy
Suess of USA had discussed on 18 January
1978, about designing
of
the first
electronic BBS i n the world and
implemented the system on 16 February
1978. This System was a message only
system for the PC users and the topics
included were C, Assembler, Al,
programming
techniques
and
communications. This BBS was designed
on an 8080 processor with 24 KB RAM, a
floppy disc drive and a modem interface.

The BBS is a miniature form of an online
system for a cost-effective distribution of
information in electronic format. BBS
supports interactive communication
between users on a wide variety of
subjects ranging from hobbies to politics.
On some BBSs, it is possible for the users to
communicate both interactively and to
leave messages for other users. Some
bulletin boards are considered more of a
talk-net than a platform to
exchange
research information. Most BBSs make
available a discussion topic list with brief
descriptions under each topic heading.
Easy to use menus guide the new user
through the bulletin boards. Some bulletin
boards provide
file transfer services.

(Samba, USA), Bulletin Board for Librarians
(BUBL, UK), National lnformation on
Software and Services (NISS, UK) are some
of the important butietin boards available
on the networks.

2.1

BUBL, UK

Bulletin Board for Librarians (BUBL), is
one of
the registered BBS on Joint
Academic Network (JANET), UK, designed
to be accessed and used in interactive
mode. BUBL was designed using Userbul
software, produced by Leicester University,
England. This interface allows the users
to move easily between files within the
bulletin board. Since the datasets are
arranged hierarchically, users need not
'climb' or 'descend' through menus in
order to reach files or henus they desire,
for example the main menu can be recalled
at any time, by typing 'M' and pressing
Return key (Fig. 1).

BUBL aims to provide a network of
library resources of information on JANET
and other networks such as Internet to the
users.

2.2

NISS, UK

The National lnformation on Software
and Services, based at the universities of
Bath and Southampton, provides a gateway
to several services. These include an online
bulletin board (NISSBB), and a catalogue of
software and databases on JANET. Its
primary
function
is
information
dissemination and online services for the
UK higher education community. In NISS
bulletin board, information is structured in a
hierarchy of sections and selected via
menus. NISSBB
has a public access
collection, i.e. a collection of datasets with
powerful search facilities. The 'POST'
command on the NISSBB can be used
to mail all the information given under the
sections on the bulletin board to local
computers. For example, if a person wants
the address list of university libraries in UK,
he can use the 'POST' command to get the
relevant information downloaded to hislher
mail box.

2.3

Subject-based BBSs

2.3.1 Chemistry
American Chemical Society (ACS),
Organic Chemistry Division and Chemical
Abstracts Service and STN International
have jointly designed and implemented a
new BBS for chemists. It allows online
meetings and to communicate with each
other without physically travelling to a
single location.
Chem REFS (Chemical Research and
Education Finding Sources) is another
electronic bulletin board (available to the
ACS members) containing information on
grants and contracts in the chemical
services and engineering. The bulletin
DESILWC Bulletin of lnfor Technol,1W5.15(4)

board also carries a new section with
. weekly coverage of science policy issues,
the federal (US) budget, and change in
grant and contract procedures or
guidelines. Except for the telephone
charges, there are no other costs involved
in using this system.

2.3.2 Engineering
The CIME-ISE is a free electronic bulletin
board service of ASMEfs Publications
Directorate. It is an online 24-hours service
and can be accessed with 300-, 1200- or
2400- baud rate modems. CIME-ISE
currently offers several programs that
includes FAT- video (Fortran Accessory
Tools) w h i c h operates w i t h I B M
monochrome, CGA and EGA video

standards. It has a variety of programming
tools for Pascal, Basic, Turbo Basic, Boosters
and T- Enhance.

4. INFRASTRUCTURE
REQUIREMENTS F O R BBS
Establishing an electronic BBS, requires
a PC, a modem, a telephone line and the
BBS software. There are several software
packages that allow us to setup and run a
BBS. These software run on variety of
computers from a simple PC (286) to
Pentium
(multi-processor), minis and
mainframes.

4.1

Manpower

One system operator (SYSOP) i s
required to maintain the system who will
receive information from the contributors,
edit it and add to the BBS. Thus, he is called
as BBS moderator or operator. Depending
upon the increase in the amount of
information, more
manpower may be
required to operate, update and maintain
the system. The person(s) may/may not be
a computer professional; any one having
some experience on computers and also
some knowledge in BBS would be able to
perform this job.

4.2

Hardware Required to Access/
Use BB Services

Anyone having an IBM AT or compatible
with 512 KB RAM, having high density
floppy drive, 15 MB hard drive, RS 232
serial port with modem and cable, and

voice grade telephone line would be able to
access/use these services.

4.3

Hardware Required to Setup a
BBS

4.3.1 Computer and Peripherals
For setting up a multimode BBS of 10
lines, the PC should have multiple COM
ports and faster speed to handle multiple
connections. For setting up a full-fledged,
national level professional BBS, a dedicated
33 MHz clock speed
mainframe
is
required. An average system configuration
required for setting up a BBS would be :
Computer : Server with 486 DX2/33 MHz
or 40 MHz or higher if possible, 20 to 24
MB RAM and 500 MB HDD.
Operating System : DOS/Windows
/Novel/Unix
BBS software
: Wildcat 4.01 (more
softwares are listed in Table 3).
Telephone : A dedicated telephone line/
lines
depending
on
the
requirement.
Modem : ZyXEL 1496E or equal having
required baud speed.
Modem Speed :1.2 kbps to 28.8 kbps.

4.3.2 Modem
Modem is one of the important
components of the BBS. All BBS software
do not support all kinds of modems,
however, a few like Hayes and US Robotics
modems support all types of BBS software.
It is better to select a modem of industry
standard (i.e., Hayes, AT Commands, MNP
Protocol, etc.) and international standards
(CCITT V.32, V.22, etc.). Since users yill
be using modems of different makes, i t is
better to select a modem that supports
maximum protocols.
A 1,200 bps modem is sufficient for the
low-end BBS, however, 2,400 bps modem
is a better choice. Some popular modems
with their baud rates are given in Table 2.

A number of BBS software packages
are available. These include a few that
are available free of cost, and others which
may be purchased through commercial
vendors. Due to limited market, BBS
software are usually available directly from
the software or communication companies.
The packages cost from less than fifty US
dollars to several thousands of
dollars. There are a few public domain
BBS software available free of cost and
may provide programming skills to novices
and hobbyists.

4.4

Selection Procedure for BBS
Software

There is no perfect BBS software which
matches the needs of all the users. Each
software has some strengths and
weaknesses and therefore comparisons
among the software are difficult. There are
three main characteristics that decide the
selection of a BBS software, viz. user needs,
software features, and software quality.

4.4.1

User Needs

The needs for designing a BBS must be
defined clearly. The clearer the user needs,
the easier the task of selecting a BBS
software. The needs include the following:

H What is the purpose of the BBS?
DESIDOC Bulletin of lnfor Technol,1W5.15(4)

H Who are the users?

H What features are to be added?
H Any important facilities such as online
surveys, electronic conferencing, chatting,
etc. to be provided?

4.4.2 Software Features
An intensive literature survey should be
conducted to know the features of the
software usually published in the form of
ratings. The features include:
H Extent of software customisation.
H Extent of programming.

H Back-up protection.

H Range of hardware program.
Features such as chat, conferencing, down
loading, posting, etc.
H No. of ports it can support.
4.4.3 Software Qualify

The following features should be looked
into while checking the quality of a BBS
software.

H User friendliness and reliability of the
software.
Availability of editing features
nesting system.

with-

W Documentation (both online and hard
COPY).
H User support.

H Updating of the software.
4.4.4 PC Board-An Ideal BBS Software

PC Board is an easy to use, standard
and inexpensive BBS software that is being
widely used by hundreds of users around
the world. It can support from two users to
65,535 users. PC Board includes other
modules (normally very expensive if we buy

them separately) such as an Internet/UUCP
Gateway, a Fido Mailer QWK Mail Support,
Credit Accounting, Sysop utilities, dBase
file Access,
Multi-channel CHAT,
Local/Network and Dial in/remote, logins,
and support for both intelligent and
non-intelligent multi-port hardware with
port speeds upto 1,15,200 bps. Moreover,
these also provide PCB Mail (a Mail
Manager for IMS Windows) free, with the
result that Windows e-mail application is
fully integrated with PC Board. The price
varies depending upon the number of
nodes needed by the user.
Some of the important PC-based BBS
software packages are listed in Table 3.

5. A PROPOSED BBS F O R

LIBRARIES
The BBS should be attractive (in terms of
its ingredients to attract callers),
user-friendly, advertising, informative and
should provide up-to-date information. An
important barometer o i BBS success is the '
number of calls it generates. An attempt is
being made to design a model BBS namely
Indian Bulletin Board System for Librarians
(IBBSYL). Various features of the proposed
system are explained in the following
sections. IBBSL can be designed and
implemented by any national agency like
INSDOC or DESIDOC. General topics to
be covered in the BBS can include advice
columns, articles on subjects of interest,
b o o k reviews, electronic mail and
conferencing, inter-library loan, job listings,
library information (such as programs,
addresses, board members, etc.), local BBS
members list, mailing lists and new books,
online newsletters and surveys, information
and
advice
on
computers/
telecommunications,
news,
wordprocessing, information exchange,
advertisements, conferencing, sponsors and
grants, bulletins (display of text files), public
message areas (online conferences), file
transfer (upload and downloading), etc.

It will be an advice information section
for
the
librarians
about the latest
hardware, software, databases and
CD-ROMs available in Indian and foreign
markets.
5.2.10 Special Interest Groups
Special interest groups (SIGs) can have
interaction with each other through
teleconferencing. The system may have as
many SlGs as are required. For example,
the Public-Access Computer System Forum
(PACS-L) is a computer conference that
deals with all computer systems that
libraries make available to their patrons.
SlGs are formed to discuss on various
topics of patron's interest
through
computer (online) conferencing. Utilising
the BBS, the users can discuss various
topics such as CD-ROM databases, expert
multimedia,
systems, hypertext progr5ms,
network-based information
resources,
OPACs, etc. Messages sent to PACS-L are
DESlDOC Bulletin of lnfor Technol, 1995.15(4)

reviewed t$y the conference moderators,
who distribute it to participants. For
example, the University
of
Houston
Library brovides PACS-L as a public
service. , It does not verify the accessory of
the subpitted message nor, does it endorses
the opi ions expressed by message author.
Author of the PACS-L messages are solely

jnstitutions. However, private agencies are
also operating such services now-a-days.
BBS software vendors claim that majority of
their customers (about 80%) are from
business or government and only about
20% are hobby or entertainment users.
While a number of BBS software packages
are available for UNIX, the vast majority are
written for MS-DOS to make the service as
cheapest as possible. Shareware and
Freeware are available on many larger BBSs
for downloading,
