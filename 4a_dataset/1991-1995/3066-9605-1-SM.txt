Abstract
Presents the basis of
than's theory ofFaeetAnalysis and
identifies its application to the analysis of knowledge. Discusses
its value in knowledge representation in different contexts.

1. Preamble
l992 is the birth centenary year
of Dr SR Ranganathan, National Research Professor in Library Science
(1965-1972). Government of India. He
was a savant of library and information
services; who promoted & organised
university library system. public library
network on state-wide basis, specialised
R&D, industrial, and business information centres. He also promoted and cultivated specialised personnel with
expertise a n d skills for h a n d l i n g
knowledge in different ways. He created
and contributed to the literature of
library science and propounded the Five
laws of Library Science, dynamic theory
16

of Library Classification, normative principles for cataloguing, scientific principles for library management, efficient
approaches to handling library measurem e n t s , d e v e l o p m e n t of n a t i o n a l
documentation systems and library netw o r k s . He developed s t a n d a r d s ,
specifications and guidelines through
the National Standards Bureau of India.
In short, he built many infrastructures
to promote organised library services in
India . This article highlights the value
of facet analysis in knowledge representation in the contemporary scene.

2. introduction
Ranganathan strived to develop an
a n a l y t i c o - s y n t h e t i c s t r u c t u r e of

knowledge. He identified his studies on
the way knowledge gets embodied in
books, periodical articles. and other
rendered material; and based it on the
way in which the seekers approach
knowledge. Further, his analysis of conceptual a s p e c t s of a n information
storage and retrieval system would provide for achieving the following aspects :
(a) Providing better access to contents
of documents;
(b) Narrowing down and broadening the
search:
(c) P r o v i d i n g a l t e r n a t i v e s e a r c h
patterns;
(d) Distinguishing between no matches
due to search error, and no matches
between t h e i t e m s n o t i n t h e
database.
However, this analysis of information
retrieval should be backed u p by the
ability to analyse and synthese texts in
a variety of ways. His postulates on
analysis lead to facet analytic approach.
Ranganathan said on the role of classification thus : 'A traveller will be helped
muck more, saved many wrong turns
and attracted to the home more easily, if
the light put up by the host is a search
light, which not only acts as a beacon but
also lights u p the region through which
he has to walk.Then there will not merely the goal be glimmering but every inch
of the way will be illuminated. The formula of facets and phases of a welldesigned analytico-synthetic scheme of
classification will serve the purpose of
such a light'(see reference 1).

3. Facet-analytic Approach
concept modelling t h r o u g h
analytico-synthetic approach, we can
adopt Ranganathan's approch (see reference 2). In his model, he proposed a
universe of discourse, called 'Basic

Subject'; with each basic subject, several
entities. their properties, and actions
can be studied in relation to space and
time. Based on this analysis he identified
a scheme for classification. he postulated categories that gave generalised
abstractions. In each instance, a subject
may have the presence of one or more of
these categories. These categories are
stated a s follows :
% T h e : The pervasive temporal
aspects of the world such as day.
night. year, century. etc.
4: Space: Geo a n d o t h e r s p a t i a l
concepts in the relational system
such as India, USA. USSR etc.
Energy: Actions of various varieties
s u c h as r u n n i n g , m a n a g i n g ,
communicating, modelling, etc.
1 Matter: The properties and other
attributes of our object, such a s
name, valency. mobility, viscosity.
etc.
1 Personality: T h e o b j e c t s , t h e i r
instantial variations, s u c h a s
automobiles, passenger cars, sports
car, etc.
Basic subject: Chunk of a field of
knowledge, convenient a s a field of
activity; such as 'Vehicle Engineering,
Land Vehicle Engineering and Motor
Vehicle Engineering.'
This is a core model from which one
can derive any number of representations
of knowledge embodied in documents and
other kinds of materials.

Thus, we see that the expressions of
summarisation of information contents
of objects can be analysed into Basic
subject, Personality, (=EnUty)and other
categories. Such an analysis leads to a n
intermediate lexicon of ideas which can
be used as modelling media for input
information in any specialised field a s
well a s a media for searching informatlon from the database. Lists of various
f e a t u r e s of Political S y s t e m a n d

useful for analyac-system can be easily
built into a design database. We shall
discuss this process in knowledge-based
Management systems also.

5. Knowledge Representation Systems
Knowledge bases have to be organised and structured a s the rules embodied in them go on increasing. Thus,
knowledge representation language
comes into play. Many issues in this
context handle both conceptual factoring and computational efficiency. In
techniques such a s semanllc nets, conceptual taxonomies, frame systems, etc;
knowledge is conceptually factored according to a hierarchy or generalisation
structure. I t is a kind sf taxonomic or
classificatory structure. KL-ONE, is a
knowledge r e p r e s e n t a t i o n s y s t e m
oriented around a taxonomy of structured concepts. The taxonomy for organising a knowledge base of rules is
described in the following paragraphs.
A concept mode in KL-ONE is associated with a set of rules (a generdisation) of the notions of attribute, part,
constituent feature, etc] and a set of
s t r u c t u r e d conditions expressing
relationships among them. These concepts are linked to more general concepts by explicit links. The more general
concept in such a relationship is called
the super concept and is said to subsume the more specific subconcept.
Some of the concepts' roles and structural conditions are attached to it directly, while others are inherited indirectly
from more general concepts.
The concepts and roles of KL-ONEare
similar in structure to classical data
structure notions of record and field or
the 'frarnel/'scheme'/'unit'and 'slot' of
much A1 terminology. However, they differ subtly in function and interpretation
since they are motivated more by an
attempt to model the semantics and conceptual structure of an abstract space of
concepts, than by issues of data and

referral operations. This difference
manifests itself in a variety of details,
such as the way subsumption is defined
and used, the pressure of associated
structural conditions attached to a concept, and the representation of explicit
relationships between roles a t different
levels.
The ability to a s s i d a t e new descriptions into an &sting Wonomy a t any
level permits a n evolutionary system
design that achieves the same standards
of rigour a s a "top-down design" without
requiring concepts to be defined in.a predetermined order. For most applications,
even if one could get the initial design
carefully laid out in top-down mode,
subsequent changes will require a n
ability to modify a system i n more
flexible ways,
A system's taxonomy of recognisable
situations should be viewed as a n evolving knowledge structure that continues
to be defmed and developed throughout
the Uetime of a system, just as it is for
human beings. In particular, eoncept u a l l y - f a c t o r e d , taxonomic representation systems s u c h as KL-ONE
appear to be well suited to such applications (see reference 3). These knowledge
structures can be used to perform a kind
of parsing of the situation, using the
patterns and schemata of the knowledge
base a s its 'grammar'. The way in which
elements of knowledge base are accessed
in this process, differs substantially
from the way in which elements of a
traditional databases are accessed.
Such access will require techniques
that are analogous to and generalisations of tradional parsing algorithms to
achieve reasonable response times. A
substantial challenge lies ahead of u s to
combine the insights of natural language
understanding and knowledge repre-

s e n t a t i o n r e s e a r c h , with t h o s e of
database organisation and retrieval in
order to develop the techniques necessary to handle large knowledge bases of
rule-like formation.

6. Development Of Decision Support System For information

Retrieval
Knowledge representation languages
can provide a base for an intermediate

lexicon. The creation of a n intermediate
lexicon as a base for inpubs and outputs
in information referral helps in the
development of intermediary system.
The intermediary system will have the
following features :
(a) It would accept statements made in
a natural language a s expression,of
the query by the information seeker.
(bj It would structure this statement
i n t o d e s c r i p t i o n s o r key
words/phrases for matching the
same with system's thesaurus.
(e) I t a r r a n g e s d e s c r i p t i o n s i n a
sequence wherein the search for
information is conducted efficiently
and productive retrieval results are
provided.
(d) It would interactively negotiate witti
the information retrieval system in
modulating the response to a query.
It would trigger interaction between
user and the system.
(el It would ask the user for terminology
modulation in understanding the
user's request and system's term
(synonym, homonym, a n d other
hierarchical structuring). These
actions would of course be well
structured by :
(i) Establishing the field of knowledge
to be searched in the database (boundaries) and the comprehension of an
information retrieval thesaurus.

of a written or expressed unit of thought.
ln dl its minutest detaiis it is what it
should be only when the thought-content as a whole is uncovered including
all the phases. facets, and foci by those
faculties which apprehend all the details
e&austively, and yet in terms of entirety
rather than in terms of merely parts. It
is only an analytico-synthetic scheme
that can uncover thought-content in
such a holistic way' (ref. 1, p. 1 15).Thus,
classification provides a kind of relational framework for knowledge-base systems.
