1. INTRODUCTION
Though the complexity of applications
of information technology in various fields
has grown, the consumer is demanding to
process ever larger volumes o f data.
Magneto Optic Disk (MOD) technology is
found to be the strongest candidate for
supplementing if not replacing magnetic
media for secondary removable storage in
view of its low /cost and large storage
density (Figure 1 and Table 1). Though large
scale production (and hence its low cost) is
yet to take place, it is bound to do so by
2000 A D given the expansion rate of
production and market penetration of
magneto-optic recording. Schroff and
Chakravarti had studied i n detail the
technologies and applications of optical
memories (1). Tf-le present study addresses
the advances which have taken place in the
last two years specifically in magneto-optic
disks.

2. MAGNETO-OPTIC DISK
TECHNOLOGY
Since the magneto-optic (MO) media i s
erasable and has high recording density, it
is a very serious candidate for use as a
secondary removable storage device. It has
additional advantages of reasonably high
data transfer rate; high tolerance to
fluctuating ambient temperature, stray
magnetic field and dusty environment.
Among the various optical recording
technologies, it is most advanced and has
large scale usage possibilities. Several US
and Japanese companies are now making
MO drives and disks and some of the
standard products marketed by them are
given in Table 2. As can be seen, the cost of
the M O disk storage varies between US$
0.27 to 0.50 per MB of storage compared
to the cost of floppy disk storage which is
US$ 1 to 2 per MB. Storage costs of other
competing media like Bernoulli magnetic
cartridge (US$ 1O/MB) are also higher than
that of MO media. Therefore, MO disk
storage at present offers the lowest cost of
storage amongst all removable storage
3

production, the cost is bound to come
down. Fujitsu plans to see M O recorders at
an affordable US$ 400 per piece within a
few years.

3.3 Applications
Due to its high access time and low data
transfer rate, M O recording system cannot
replace the magnetic hard disks for online
direct-access-storage devices. However,
where a large volume of data is to be
handled and stored through removable
medium or where data security i s a must,
the MO media is the most appropriate
medium today.
With increasing use of faster computers
having large semiconductor RAM size in
industry offices and homes, stand-alone
small computer systems have to handle
large volumes of data and multimedia
systems will be used for this purpose. Once
that happens, floppy disks (as used
presently) will not suffice to store this
volume of data and transfer it to other
computers. The M O recording system
appears to be the obvious replacement for
floppies in PCs and work stations. Potential
application areas include strategic and
military applications.
I t is interesting to correlate the
development of the M O recording
technology with development of PCs. By
2000 AD, a PC is expected to have 1 GB of
semiconductor RAM memory with a
processing speed of 100 MIPS. However,
this will not make secondary memories
obsolete. It is well known that for efficient
operation of a PC, a secondary storage ten
times the size of the RAM memory is
required. A window of opportunity exists
for the M O technology to offer an
appropriate secondary memory of the size
of 10 GB in a PC.

3.4 Limitations
The main competitor to the MO
technology is still the magnetic recording
technology specially for the erasable and
removable high density recording system.
The magnetic recording seems to be a cat
with nine lives. Since 1970s its demise has
been predicted again and again by the
'experts'-first due to the advent o f
magnetic bubbles and now due to the
optical recording. But each time the
technology has fought back with
improvements and cost reductions which
the new challengers could not match.
Today, i t rules supreme for the
direct-access-storage device applications,
but is being challenged by optical disk
technology in the removable media market.
It is fighting .back through attempts like
floptical disks and newer developments can
be expected in future.

4. CONCLUSIONS
As one can see, the various technologies
are finding their niche in the memory
technology scenario and each has its area
of application. As direct-access-storage
devices, hard disk drives based on
longitudinal magnetic recording have no
competitors mainly due to their short
access time, a requirement essential for
online operation. For offline secondary
storage, CD-ROM, WORM, erasable phase
change and M O disks are competing. Each
is finding its own market segment. While
CD-ROM and WORM disks are suitable for
archival use, various cost and performance
considerations show that magneto-optic
disk is gradually winning the race for use as
removable erasable secondary storage disk.
However, it is still facing stiff competition
from conventional magnetic tapes and
disks. It must improve its cost/performance
continuously in order to replace these

media. Cost of the MO media is expected
to go further down when it will be mass
produced. However, the cost of the MO
drive is still very high compared to other
drives like floppy disk drives and is proving
to be the main obstacle to attain a rapid
expansion of usage of MO recording
technology. However, the drive cost is also
expected to go down in near future. Fujitsu
is currently pricing a 128 MB 90 mm disk
drive at US$ 696 and it expects its cost to
go down to US6348 by 1995.

2.1 Application Areas
Commercialisation of MO storage
technology depends upon opening up
application areas where the medium has
unique advantages. This alone can lead to
the familiar cycle of higher demand
higher production volume lower cost
higher demand. The application areas can
be roughly divided into two categories, viz.,
(i) back-up for DASDs (Direct-AccessStorage-Devices) in large main frame

DASDs, an application which is ideal for the
MO media. Such storage devices can have
storage capacity of more than 10 GB using
several MO disks i n a juke box-like
configuration. A single juke box made by
Alphatronix USA can store upto 93 GB in
random access mode for use in on-line,
near- line or archival applications. NTT has
made a DASD with 250 CB to 1 TB
capacity using 130 mm (5.25") M O disks.
Ricoh is supplying a 10 GB system with
sixteen 130 mm size MO disks. Sharp is.also
offering a 2.2 GB system with six 130 rnm
size MO disks.
The main use of MO disks will be for
workstations and PCs i n applications
requiring large secondary storage like in
CAD/CAM and image processing. Some of
the applications are listed in Table 3.

2.2 Demand Projection and
Production of MO Disks
The demand for MO disks although
modest at present is expected to reach
about 23 million pieces (15 million 90 mm
size disks and 7.5 million 130 mm size

disks) by 1995 and is expected to grow
further at the rate of 50 per cent per year.
In 1993, the demand was for about 5.5
million pieces costing about US$ 500
million. It is to be noted that although 130
mm size disks were first introducedinto the
market in late eighties, the demand for 90
mm size disks introduced later is more than
that of the 130 mm size disks and i t i s
increasing at a faster pace.
The production of M O drives and
systems is mainly concentratedin japan and
USA. Although several US companies are
providing M O disk drives, only one US
company (3 M Company) is making the
MO disks. The market is dominated by
Japanese companies. Among the most
notable developments i s the plan of Fujitsu
company to make 50,000 M O drives per
month, which is five times the present
capacity of the Sony Corp., one of the early
starters of production of the drives. It is also
selling 90 mm disk drives at the lowest cost
of US$ 696 per drive and plans to bring
down the cost to half by the year 1995.
Fujitsu is offering 130 mm M O disk drive
with 60 M B capacity for note book PCs and
word processors to replace floppy drives. It
can also be used in systems used for
phones, facsimiles and electronic still
cameras. Ricoh is increasing its production
of M O drives. Toshiba is also increasing its
capacity to 10,000 units/month. ldemistu
Petrochemical, Japanis setting up a US$ 16
million facility to make 90 mm MO disks
and drives. Sony is releasing a 90 mm MO
drive which is less than half in size and
twenty two per cent lighter in weight than
current drives. Ricoh is marketing an optical
filing system based on 90 mm M O drive.
Similarly most Japanese companies are
extending their production capacities for
MO disks. Some of these are pooling their
resources to capture the world market.

2.3 Near Future Technology
Development in MO Recording
M O recording technology i s now
attractive for several companies to go in for
large scale production. Despite its
limitations,
various
technological
developments are taking place which show
promise of improved MO disk production
in near future. Some of these have increased
capacity, new MO layer materials, direct
overwrite capability and better production
machines.

2.4 Improved Production Technology
For metallising CDs CD-ROMs and MO
disks, DC/RF sputtering with or without
magnetron i s usually used. For
productionising this multi-layer thin
deposition process, initially large systems
with large multiple targets were used and
several disks were coated simultaneously to
increase the production rate. However,
in-line coating facility where single disk i s
coated in a series of small sputtering units
i s now available. This is more cost effective.
Such a system facilitates optimisation of
deposition conditions of each layer in
isolated vacuum systems and leads to better
reproducibility. The cost of the system also
goes down since each individual system i s
small.

3. STATUS OF MO RECORDING
TECHNOLOGY
In order to understand the status of M O
recording vis-a-vis other technologies
available today, an analysis of strengths,
weaknesses, applications and limitations i s
given below:

3.1 Strengths
The obvious strength of the M O
technology i s that it i s an erasable recording
technology with a high areal recording
OESIDOC Bulletin of Inf Tedrnol, 1994, 14(1)

density of 40 ~ B / c r n and
~ with good
prospects of increasing the areal density to
~
blue lasers. The only
400 M B / C ~using
technology which can compete with this
capability is the longitudinal magnetic
recording (LMR) media with fixed heads
(hard disks). Although a decade back it was
thought that the areal density in LMR media
will saturate around 5 M B / c ~ * ,today ISM
is offering commercial system (IBM 33900)
with areal density of 10 MB/cm and media
~
with areal densities of 300 ~ B / c r nhave
been demonstrated. As these media are
longitudinal, serious noise problem i s
encountered at high recording densities
with the bit size approaching the grain size.
Typically it shows a CNR of 20-30 dB at such
high areal density. On the other hand, M O
media supports perpendicular domains and
is amorphous in nature and closer domain
spacing becomes more viable and,
therefore, the M O media shows a CNR of
45 dB even at a high recording density.
The second strength of the M O media is
the larger head-to-media distance, which
makes head crash almost impossible. It also
tolerates dusty conditions due to the use of
a focused laser beam for read/write action.
This media has a very high coercivity and as
the domains are perpendicular to the plane
o f the media, it faces a smaller
demagnetising field. Therefore, it can resist
demagnetisation due to stray magnetic
field, a common problem in magnetic
media.

Perhaps the main strength of the M O
media is the low cost of storage. It now costs
about US$ 0.27 per MB of storage using a
130 mm M O disk and is the cheapest of all
removable recording media. With mass
production yet to come, prospects of still
lower cost of storage are bright.
DESIOOC Bulletin of Inf Technol, 1994, t4(1)

3.2 Weaknesses
The MO media is facing hurdles for
wider application due to several
weaknesses. The media has a longer access
time (40 ms) than that of magnetic hard disk
(10 ms), but it is comparable to that f ~ the
r
floppy disks and other optical recording
media. The second weakness is the slow
data transfer rate of about 4 MB/s for
recording. The main reason for this is the
heavy read/write head which can be
improved by placing multiple disks in
parallel. Another reason i s the slow
overwrite speed resulting from the two
passes required for rewriting in M O media.
As explained above, directly overwritable
disks are now possible albeit with multiple
layer magnetic thin films, which make
production a little more complicated and a
data transfer rate as high as 64 MB/s has
been achieved.
Being a Tm-Re (Thulium-Rhenium) alloy,
the active magnetic layer in M O media is
susceptible to oxidation. Although efforts
such as coatingwith a protective non-oxide
dielectric over the layer followed by
lacquering the layer, adding dopants like Ti
to the layer to increase its oxidation
resistance have been made, the long term
reliability of the media is not yet fully
proven. However, the lifetime of the media
is predicted to be about 10 years, a figure
comparable to the lifetime of the magnetic
media, but somewhat inferior to that of the
CD-ROMs. The M O recording system
generates relatively a higher amount of heat
during operation and its internal mounting
inside PCs will require extra cooling. At
present external mounting is preferred.
Although the cost of M O media is low,
M O recorders are expensive (at US$2000)
and there is customer resistance to go in for
an expensive hardware. With mass

conventional technologies especially since
the conventional magnetic recording
technology i s also improving its
cost/performance. As Gote, Lab Editor of
BYTE Magazine, states, 'For many
applications, M O i s now the way to goN,
MO looks to be the wave of the future. At
the same time, there are improved MO
technologies over the horizon capable of
giving a recording density of 400 MB/cm,
data transfer rate of 64 MB/s and direct
overwrite capability. If this can be achieved

in production, magnetic hard disk will have
a fight in hand even for the direct-accessand
storage application.
