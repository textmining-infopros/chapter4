Marketing of lnformation Prsduds and Services through a
Consortium Approach
MN Seethararnan*
Consultant, GIST, Bangalore - 560 008

The consortium approach involves participation of a group of
individuals or organisations in ventures of common interest. The
author presents a model consortium for marketing of information
products and services. The consortium named as CSIR-INFOCON,
i.e., CSlR Information Consortium. Details of its composition,
participating organisations and the services and products proposed to
be marketed by the Consortium are also given.

A 'consortium' may be defined as a
group of organisations or individuals who
come together for the common purpose of
planning and executing major projects by
pooling their individual resources and
expertise.
The consortium approach is a new
business trend and innovation. Its
beginnings can be traced to Japan where
there is a strong tradition of joint ventures
by business organisations, industry and the
Government.
Recently, a number of
Japanese business organisations and the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry
have jointly promoted about 3 0 major
projects i n the field of electronics,
computers and telecommunications.

ln the United States also, a clear shift 'is
taking place towards a military-civilian
consortia
i n undertaking
several
developmental projects.
Some of the major consortium based
projects in Europe include the Eurofighter
aircraft and the recently completed
underwater Eurotunnel linking France and
England. The Airbus Industrie which builds
the famous 'Airbus' series of civil transport
aircraft is an example of the success of the
consortium approach involving aircraft
companies from severs( European
countries. A large number of such initiatives
are also being taken in countries like South
Korea and Taiwan.
Following the economic reforms
introduced in India since 7 991, the
consortium approach i s gaining ground in
the planning and execution of many major
projects. The Dabhol Power Project in

Maharashtra is a recent example of a
consortium which is executing a 695 MW
power station estimated to cost over seven
billion US dollars. This consortium includes
the Enron Corporation of USA, the
Governments of Maharashtra and India,
and several Indian and foreign financial
institutions.

2. BENEFlTS OF THE
CONSORTIUM APPROACH
The consortium approach is found to be
beneficial in several respects that inciude
the following :
IS Large investments by the Government on
major capital projects can be avoided,
thereby transferring the scarce resources
to welfare oriented projects like rural
development, health care, education, etc.

B investments on a project are shared by all
organisations participating in the
consortium.

M Each organisation contributes its own
specialised expertise which otherwise
might have to be procured from elsewhere
at added cost.
M The risk of cost and time over-runs are
reduced.
The consortium may bid for bigger
projects within the country or abroad
based on the experience of successfully
completed projects.

3. CONSORTIUM APPROACH TO
MARKETING INFORMATION
PRODUCTS & SERViCES IN
INDIA
There i s good scope for forming
consortia in lndia for producing and
marketing information products and
services, as a profit-oriented business
venture. There is a growing demand for
4

information services in the country,
particularly from the industrial and
corporate sectors. Secondly, there are a
large number of specialised libraries and
information centres having good document
collections, experienced information
handling personnel and other modern
facilities required to establish and operate
such consortia.
This paper seeks to present a model for
setting up a consortium for developing and
marketing information products and
services in the subject fields of science,
engineering and technology in order to test
the viability of such a venture. If this model
proves to be successful, it can be applied to
other subject fields like agricultural
sciences, life sciences, etc.

4. A PROPOSED MODEL FOR AN
INFORMATION CONSORTIUM
When we think of setting up an
information consortium in the field of
science, engineering and technology as a
model, the initiative has to be taken by the
Country's premier research agency, namely,
the Council of Scientific and Industrial
Research (CSIR), because of the several
advantages it has, as mentioned below :

ill There are about 40 research laboratories/
institutes under the CSlR covering diverse
subjects i n the field o f science,
engineering and technology.

I These laboratories/institutes which came
up during the last four decades or so have
well-equipped libraries and information
centres with specialised document
collections in the relevant subject areas.
lssl The document collections in the CSlR
laboratories/institutes are estimated to
exceed 2.5 million volumes having book
value of over Rs. 50 crores.

III INSDOC which is the national scientific
and documentation centre in lndia i s also

under the CSIR, as one of its major
Institutes.
1BB Libraries and information centres under
CSlR have highly-qualified and
experienced personnel capable of
developing and marketing wide range of
information products and services.

P Several of these libraries and information
centres have already introduced modern
facilities for quick access, storage, retrieval
and dissemination of information.

A dedicated data communication
network, SIRNET is already linking various
CSlR libraries/information centres.
The proposed Consortium may be
named as 'CSIR-INFOCON' (i.e., CSlR
Information Consortium). To give an
independent identity to the consortium, it
may be treated as one of the main divisions
of CSIR on par with its existing Patents Unit
and Manpower Unit.
The Consortium may be constituted with
an initial organisational set-up comprising of
the following key personnel:
(a) Director

Other officers of the Consortium may be
selected by direct recruitment or drawn
from among the existing staff in CSlR on
deputation basis.
Accommodation, secretarial and other
support facilities may be provided in the
CSlR Headquarters office, or in INSDOC,
as deemed necessary.
The Consortium may set up an Advisory
Council to assist it in all matters relating to
the production, marketing and sale of
information products and services. The
Advisory Council will be composed of the
following :
(a) President :
Director of the consortium (ex- officio)
(b) Vice-President :
joint Director
(ex-officio)

of

(d) Marketing Officer :
Member (ex-officio)

(b) Joint Director
(c) Chief-Executive O f f cer

(f) Members (Five) :

(e) Operations Officer

(f) Finance Officer
jg) Secretary (Administration)
A renowned scientist, or even one of the
retired directors of CSIR, may be appointed
as a full-time Director of the Consortium.
The Director of INSDOC may be the
ex-officio Joint Director of the Consortium.
A library or information officer with
considerable experience in planning and
developing information products and
services may be appointed as the Chief
Executive Officer of the Consortium.

The tenure of the members of the
Advisory Council (other than that of the
ex-officio members) may be for a period of
two years. O n the expiry of their term, new
members can be inducted in their places.
If this experiment. of setting up of the
information Consortium as one of the major
division/units of CSlR is successful
commercially, the Consortium may be
converted either as a registered society or
even as a Public Limited Company
eventually.

Service Units

While the Consortium and its secretariat
may be located in the CSlR Headquarters
for administrative convenience, the
production, marketing and sale of the
information products and services have to
be carried out through several service units
located i n different CSlR libraries/
information centres.
As a first step in this direction, the
libraries/information centres i n the
following CSlR laboratories which have
significant document collections and which
are already providing a variety of
information services may be deemed to be,
ipso facto, the service units and
participating members of the Consortium :
INSDOC, New Delhi.

4.2.2 Memberships in Professional
Associations

The Consortium and other service unlts
may enroll themselves as members In
several foreign professional associations,
information/document delivery centres,
etc., in order to avail their services and
then make them available commercially in
India.
DMDOC Bullet~nof lnfor Technol,1995.1 5(4)

For example,
memberships in the
following
overseas
professional
associations/ document delivery centres
may be considered :

O

American Society for Testing Materials/
NPL, New Delhi.
Materials Information/ NML, jamshedpur.
American Institute of Aeronautics &
Asfronautics/NAL, Bangalore.

CJBritish Library Document Supply Centre/

The Consortium and its constituer~tunits
may require additional manpower for the
day-to-day operations and services.
Brilliant students c o m i n g o u t of
INSDOC,
DRTC
and
Universiiy
Departments of library and information
science may be selected for appointment as
'trainees' or 'apprentices' in the Consortium
office and its service units, for a period of
two years under the Government of lndia
Apprenticeship Scheme which provides for
payment of 50% of the stipend by the
Government.

INSDOC, New Delhi.

4.2.3

Union Catalogues

While a National Union Catalogue of
Scientific serials exists for access online or
through CD-ROM, similar union catalogues
for other type of publications held by all
CSlR libraries may have to be compiled for
use of the Consortium.

4.2.4 Specialists' Databank
The success of the Consortium, as a
commercial venture, depends on its ability
to identify and make use of the specialised
knowledge and services of the scientific
and technical personnel working in various
CSlR Laboratories. For this purpose, a
specialists data bank containing
- the
following information on each specialist
may be maintained :
(a) Name, address and telephone number of
the specialist
(b) Name of CSlR laboratory in which he is
working
(c) Areas of spec~alizdtion for purpose of
and
trouble-shooting
operations
consultancy services
(d)Terms and conditions of the services
offered, and
(e) Manpower.
DESIDOC Bulletinof lnfor Technol, 1995.15(4)

Depending on the volume of business
growth and profits, rcgulai professional staff
may be appo~ntedas and when the need
arises.

4.2.5 Funding
CSlR may consider providing an
one-time grant of Rs. five lakhs to 'the
consortium as seed-money. A Revolving
Fund may be opened to account for the
expenses incurred and payments received.
The Service Units may be ailowed to
absorb the initial operational expenses
within their annual budgets till such time
when the Consortium i s able to be
self-supporting and earn a profit.
The Industrial Development of Bank of
lndia (IDBI) provides 'venture capital' for
entrepreneual projects of this nature
through banks and the Technology
Development & rnfor-rnation Company of
India. This source of funding may also be
considered, if necessary.

5, CONSORTIUM PRODUCTS
AND SERVICES
The range of ~nforrnat~on
products and
services that the Consortium could offer
commercially IS briefly outlined in the
following paragraphs.
7

5.1

State-of-Art Reports

The Consortium may commission the
preparation, printing and sale of state-of-art
reports, critical reports, technological
forecasting reports, data compilations, etc.,
on emerging topics on its own initiative
with the help of the specialists covered by
the Data Bank. Such reports can also be
prepared on specific demands from the
industry.

5.2

Test Reports

Most CSlR laboratories have several
specialised analytical equipment and test
facilities. The Consortium may serve as a
focal point for marketing test services and
issuing test reports. It may bring out a
compendium of the test equipment and
facilities available in the CSlR laboratories
and distribute it to potential industrial users
in order to promote better commercial
utilisation of these facilities.

5.3

Consultancy Services

The Consortium may also assist the CSlR
laboratories in their efforts to market their
consultancy services by undertaking
extensive publicity campaigns, arranging
visits t o individual laboratories b y
industrialists, entrepreneurs, etc.

5.4

Information Access

The Consortium may formulate uniform
policies and procedures for providing
access to all CSlR libraries and information
centres for reference and consultation by all
bonafide users through a scheme of a
common corporate and individual paidmembership.

5.5

Publications Lists and
Document Loans

The Consortium may arrange to bring
out lists of specialised and industry-oriented
publications such as, technical reports,

conference proceedings,
manuals,
handbooks, data reports, etc., that are
available in CSlR libraries. For example,
some time back, the Information Centre for
Aerospace Sciences and Technology in
NAL, Bangalore, brought out a publications
list on 'Composite Materials' and distributed
i t to user organisations in Aerospace and
Defence .
Such publication lists on emerging
technologies may be compiled and
distributed among all potential users in the
Country. Publications required by any user
may be issued on loan on payment of
specified charges (say, Rs.100 for each
document loan upto 4 weeks).

5.6

CSiR Accession List

In addition to such ad hoc publication
lists, the Consortium may issue a monthly
Combined CSlR Accession List covering the
latest documents added to all its libraries
and distribute it free of charge to all user
organisations to promote document loans.
A pre-paid coupon scheme may also be
considered to simplify the loan procedures.
Using a pre-paid coupon with a face value
of Rs.100, it should be possible for any one
to borrow a document from CSlR libraries
on loan for 4 weeks.

5.7

Literature Search Services

Many CSlR laboratories have set up
facilities for litaature search online or from
compact-disc databases.
These Laboratories are already offering
literature search services to outside users
also, on payment o i nominal charges. The
Consortium may evolve a common policy
and strategy for marketing this service
nationally on uniform schedule of charges,
after obtaining the permission from the
database producers, where necessary.
DESIDOC Bulletin of lnfor Technol, 1995.15(4)

5.8

photocopy 5ervice of the British Library's
Document Supply Centre

?rarrs:ation Services

INSDOC, New Delhi, has set up a large
Technical Translation Unit and offers a
nation-wide translation service in the field
of science and technology. To support this
activity, it maintains a databank of technical
translators.
All that needs to be done ,now is to
channelise this service through the
Consortium and to market it on a wider
scale commercially.

5.9

Reprints Service

The National Science l i b r a r y of
INSDOC, New Delhi, and several other
CSlR libraries have extenslve collections of
current and back volumes of scientific and
technical journals. Some libraries like those
in the National Aerospace Laboratory,
Bangalore, and the Indian institute of
Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, may
have large collections of technical reports,
patents and other non-book materials.

At present, INSDOC and other CSlR
libraries, some of which have been
designated as NlSSAT Sectoral lnformation
Centres, are already offering a reprints
service.
The Consortium may centralise this
service by taking the following steps:
(a) Publicise and
extensively

market

this

service

(b) Introduce a pre-paid coupon scheme with
pre-printed order forms on the lines of the

(c) Receive all requests for reprints centrally

in the consortium office
(d)Account for the pre-paid coupons and
redirect the order forms to INSDOC or to
the concerned CSlR Library which may
have the source document for supply to
the user on 'ship-to' basis
(e) Approve a policy under which a reprint
from a source document that is not held
in INSDOC or in any other CSlR
laboratory 1s procured from the overseas
document delivery centre and supplied to
the d e n t drrectly by the service unlt
concer!?ejl.

5.10 Other information Products and
Services
As the Consortium gains experience and
understands the market and its demands in
more detail, several other information
products and services could be planned
and introduced to meet such demands.

6. CONCLUSION
Marketing information products and
services more effectively, economically and
profitably can be done by a consortium
rather than by individual
library or
information centre as at present.
The present liberalised and competitive
business environment prevailing in the
country is the most appropriate time for
experimenting ~ i t hthis new concept and
approach.
