Abstract
Online database searches have become common and a number of
American and European databases, notably those related to science and
engineering have become very popular due to their specialisation in specific
fields. Although telecommunication charges are relatively low, specific
database charges are substantiHI, depending upon the area of specialisation.
This paper discusses the access and search of global databases, value
addition through organisation of the received data and sharing of the
organised data in the local area network. The original organised database
when accessed and downloaded becomes an ASCll file. If the selected
database is to be reconstructed at the receiving end, it i s a laborious task
of manual data entry which could be very slow and error-prone. A program
developed for automated conversion of the ASCll file into a standard
database format is described.

1. INTRODUCTION
A database may be defined as a collection
of interrelated data stored together without redundancy to find multiple applications. It is, in
fact, an array of data organised in a logical
manner with minimum functional and maximum tolerable redundancy, indexed in a way
most optimal for the kind of application the user

tapes, etc. 1
Database environment can be classified into
operational environment and decision support
environment. The primary aim of the operational environment is towards online performance and data integrity, whereas the decision
support environment is aimed at user flexibility
in viewing the data. The decision support environment operates on downloaded data that is

present a case study on DIALOG.^

Global databases come under decision sup
port environment. They can be defined as a
collection of information which is accessed all
around the globe. These databases cover practically all fields of human activity. The databases
are built through contributions from several
universities and organisations.'They form the
most important part of today's informationtechnology and offer almost all the needed information instantaneously. They support a large
number of queries made by today's R&D organisations and industries.

2. DIALOG DATABASE
2.1 What is DIALOG

DIALOG is an 'electronic library' used to
locate information on most of the subjects from
a variety of sources. Using DIALOG, we can
quickly browse through 'volumes' of information.
The DIALOG system manages a wide variety
of information, including references and a b
stracts relating to published literature, statistical
tables, directories, business and financial data
(such as financial reports), and for a rapidly
growing number of publications, ,the complete
text of articles.

These global databases are accessed by the
users all around the globe through public data
networking using satellites. This accessed information can either be received through courier
services or can be downloaded to a userend
computer. These global databases are viewed as
valuable resources. Access to these databases is
charged, depending on the value of the database, satellite time used, etc.

This information has been collected, organised and produced in machine-readable
form (on magnetic tape) by many publishers,
who, in turn, are contracted by DIALOG to store
their collections on its mainframe computers.

Databases searches usually serve a useful
purpose immediately, but paper copies tend to
get lost. If the same information is downloaded
into computer format, it i s preserved for a longer
duration, but cannot be retrieved easily, since it
is not in the form of a structured database. A
study has, therefore, been carried out to detect
the received information format and suitable
identifiers located so as to facilitate structuring
of the information with minimum manual effort.
A costeffective way of searching these databases and sharing the facility among different
Defence establishments i s presented in this
paper. We propose that individual subscribers
to these databases, after search, shall maintain
the searched data in a structured and sharable
form at their work place. Later, these users shall
send their searched data to a commonly identified nodal agency in the premises. At the time
of any new search, the users shall first search in
the common database maintained at the nodal
agency. If the query i s not answered, then they
are advised to search the global database. As
most of the defence establish~nentsare sub-

DIALOG customers can search for and view
the information contained in over 300 databases via telecommunication networks. A single
database contains anywhere from 3,000 to
70,00,000 records, which can be browsed online, downloaded on to local disk or printed
offline.
2.2 How to Access DIALOG

Hardware
IBM or compatible PC/AT using a modem,
compatible with CClTT Standard with 300,
1200,2400 or 4800 baud rate, which can
be internal or external to the computer,
and telephone lines/packet-switched data
networks.
Software
Communication software like DIALOGLINK, PROCOMM, etc.

.

To access DIALOG the user first logs into the
national networks, which, in turn, hooks to international networks, via GPSS, Bombay.

2.3 Billing Methodology
DIALOG has an annual renewal fee per pas<
word. There is no monthly minimum. A DIALOG
subscriber pays only for the time he actually uses
this service.
Factors affecting monthly invoice include

(a) Connect time:
Charges for the duration of time spent
online. Charges vary with different databases.
(b)Tefecommunication charges:
Charges for the telecommunication network used.
(c) Per-item type charges:
Charges for viewing records accessed during the search.

General Format for DIALOG Search
The following are the predefined formats for
DIALOG search
Format 1 : DIALOG accession number

3. RE-STRUCTURING OF
SEARCHED DATA
The downloaded data at the user end i s an
unstructured ASCll file created depending on
the search carried out. This ASCll file should to
be re-organised and structured. Then this file i s
ready for sharing among different users as a
database.
A method for structuring the downloaded
file, is presented in the following sections.
3.1 Underlying Concept

The search is carried out by specifying the
search number followed by search format and
number of records. The records are separated
by this key in the received text.
key : i/j/k
where i is the search number, j is the search
format, and k is the record number.

out searches in various fields, it i s appropriate to
mutually share the databases.
These individual subscribers will first structure their searched information, reorganise it to
form a shared database, and send the same to
a common nodal agency. This nodal agency
shall be responsible for maintaining a common
database. Later on, a user will first access the
common nodal agency to find the required
information. If he does not get the needed
information, he wilt go for DIALOG access.

read keywords and subject for
classification

Thus, value is added to this unstructured
received data by developing it into a database
and sharing the same among many users. The
user will be paying only the communication
charges in case he gets the needed information
from the nodal agency. If the search fails, he has
to pay only nominal overhead charges. The main
advantage is that this common database will
grow with time and will be able to support more
queries.

subjects from keywords and

The value-addition is in the most important
area, i.e., cost. Costefhctiveness becomes o b

Research & Development Establishment
(Engrs) (R&DE(E) is a subscriber to DIALOG
database. In addition, R&DE(E) has a local area
network spread across its campus. The data
searched is downloaded and restructured, as
described above. This database is added as a
new resource to the library information system
on the local area network and is now being
shared among the users of the network. Within
a short time, the number of records available in
R&DE(E) database has crossed 500.

time charges + per item type charges), and TC
i s the telecommunicationcharges (call duration
charges + data transfer charges).

Further, the telecommunication charges for
a national call are one fourth of those of an
international call.

Consider a typical sample DIALOG search
carried out on a certain topic using NTlS file (File
number 6) which results in a collection of 100
records on that topic. The expanses incurred

Various Defence Establishments including
R&D units, services, production units, etc are
located all over the country. They all need information about Defence technology, but in different contexts. Some of these Defence.units are
subscribers to global databases. The information
searched by these units may at times be redurtdant, resulting in duplication of search and
hence extra cost.
We propose that a nodal agency be identified to maintain the database, .constructed
through contributions from different subscribers. Figure 3 shows how the DRDO database will
grow richer through multiple users. The subscribers will first search through this database
maintained by the nodal agency and then
search in DIALOG if the search at the nodal

agency fails. Also, the users, when searching
through DIALOG, will add the searched jnformation to the database maintained by the nodal
agency. The individual users will be accessing
this common database maintained at the nodal
agency through I-Net, introduced by the Department of Telecommunications.
I-Net offers facilities for interlinking terminals
and computers through packet switches located
in important cities of the country. Subscribers to
this network can also access international networks abroad through GPSS of VSNL at Bombay.
Although expensive, access to global databases is required to keep R&D personnel abreast
of advances in various fields of their interest. A
cost-effective way i s to share the information
maintained at the nodal agency, eliminating redundant searches of global databases.

4.3 Legal Aspects

The proposed information sharing is legal,
since the information stays within the customer's organisation and is not resold.
