ABSTRACT

The paper discusses the efforts made for a Periodicals Management
System developed and designed for implementation in SAC Library,
using DBASE ||| software. it briefly describes the computer
programmes in PMS and highlights the present system which is
implemented by using ’LIBSYS’, a comprehensive library software
package and a multi-user system on Pentium system, under Unix
environment.

1. INTRODUCTION

Information is an essential resource for
development. It is a key factor, both in
decision-making as well as in subsequent
actions to be taken by an organisation for
development and research. We are living in
the age of information explosion. This is
evident from the large number of
periodicals and books published in the
world every year. The number of articles
and papers being produced in different
branches of knowledge every year is mind
boggling. The age of ’information society' is
round the corn’er.

of publication, price, etc.

    

2. NEED FOR AUTOMATION

Automation of periodicals managei,
requires utmost concentration and
involvement. It is one-of the '
complicated technical processes carri 
by a library. The following Chara "
necessitate the need of automatl
handling periodicals.

Surveys reveal that scientists,
technologists, doctors and decision makers,
most frequently use periodicals as primary
sources of information. Periodicals
constitute the most important segment of
technical literature on which library and

LIBRARY

(Library currently receives 540
and have more than 12,000 bound
On an average 10 to 15 journals
every year. Manual control of
using conventional methods is
‘duclve to meet the specific
t of the users in the least
time. Because of the multifarious
being faced, it was decided to
the procedures relating to
  » control.

  FIGURATION AND
' ARE

‘ ‘ beginning efforts were made to
 the system using DATATRIEVE

orsoo'c Bulletin orinr

software and FORTRAN language on VAX
"[780. An HCL PC XT was installed in SAC
library in the year 1987 on which the
present system was implemented using
dBase lll+ package.

The database of holdings of periodicals
in SAC Library was created using dBase Ill
software. This simpliﬁed its regular updation
with speed, accuracy and efﬁciency with
less manpower. The database was updated
in 1986, 1991 and 1994. The holdings
database is useful in getting several outputs
like missing issues list, subject~wise list,
country-wise list, frequency-wise list, and
current list of periodicals. Missing issues list
is generally required to complete the lacuna
of backfiles of journals.

In addition to the holdings of periodicals,
other outputs were also obtained by using
the same database. these include vendor’s
list, publisher’s list, status-wise list, subject
list, list of duplicate issues, renewal orders
list, etc.

In 1990, it was decided that the library
information system should be in multi~user
environment, so that many in-house
activities and users can be handled by the
system at a time and also that in-house
activities should be integrated. Therefore, a
Wipro Genius 386 with 380 MB hard disc,
an eight port card for eight terminals with
Unix Operating System was installed in the
Library.

At this juncture, it was felt necessary to
have an integrated library management
software package. From the available ready
made library software packages, 'LiBSYS'
software developed by M/s INFOTEC
Consultants Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, was found
suitable for our requirements. It is an
integrated multi~user library informatiOn
management system which supports all
in-house activities and public access
information system. It has maximum

possible integration of functions, where
data entered once can be accessad from
various angles with powerful search and
query facilities. It was obtained and installed
on Genius 386 in October 1991.

Recently a Pentium microprocessor with
the following configuration has been
installed :

As mentioned earlier, LIBSYS - is being
used for different activities of SAC Library.
Presently, LIBSYS version 2.3 is being used.
It is easy to operate and the staff can learn
it quickly without any pro-requisite
programming/computer skills. It ensures
high productivity because of minimal data
entry requirements. LIBSYS supports almost
all activities relating to acquisition,
cataloguing, circulation, serials, article
indexing and online public access
catalogue.

5.1 Serials Control in SAC Library

The Serial Control Sub-system of LIBSYS
is an independent system in SAC Library
which provides control of periodical
subscriptions and subsequent monitoring of
the scheduled arrival of individual issues. It
maintains a recurd of budget sanctioned for
serials under different categories, amount
encumbered and expanded for complete
budgetary control. This sub—system alsa
handles serials on subscription, gratis or on
exchange.

5.2 Serials Menu

The functions of Serials Menu as shown
in Fig. 2 and are discussed below.

5.2. I New Subscription

New subscription of a serial is initiated
in this system by entering its basic details,
such as title, publisher, ISSN, country,
annual subscription, etc. The titles initiated
for new subscription pass through the
approval process by printing an approval
form. After approval status is recorded, the
new serials are available for ordering.
Ordering involves specifying a vendor and
selecting approved serialls) for the order.
After placing an order, the important
function is to update subscription details.
The worksheet details are shown in Fig. 3.

The information to be provided in this
worksheet should be perfect, since it plays

Receiving Issues

iving issues is one of the most
nt functiOns of the system which
well-designed screen requiring entry
nimum possible data. It involves
ding of volume and issue
- [period which ever is applicable for
'al. There is separate facility for
issues and additional issues
tively. This function automatically

updates the serial holdings. It has a
provision to record damaged/soiled issues
for subsequent replacement. Duplicate
issues whenever recorded are flushed,
however, it allows the recording of the
same in the serial holdings to enable
generation of 'duplicate issues’ list.

5.2.5 Claims Monitoring

Monitoring of issues to be received as
per the respective frequency of each
subscribed serial basically involves,
generating notices which could be mailed
directly to the vendors/publishers for
overdue, not received and received
damaged/soiled issues. The following
functions are used for monitoring of issues:

I Schedule updates
I Reminder notices
I Display reminders

(a) Schedule updates : This function allows
entering the schedule of irregular issues of a
serial. For serials having regular frequency
such as monthly, or quarterly, the schedule is
automatically developed on the basis of the
ﬁrst issue scheduled and in-transit delay (in
days).

(b) Reminder notices : The notices to the
vendors/publishers are generated which list
out the serials having 'overdue’, ’missing’ and
’soiled/damaged’ issues. For each serial,
complete details of all the issues for which
reminders to be sent to the vendor/publisher,
are given in the notices. These also contain
the reference and date of the last reminder
sent for each issue.

While developing reminders, the system
asks for the subscription year for which
reminders are to be generated. As the
subscription year is entered, the system
identiﬁes the overdue, missing and
soiled/damaged issues from the current
holdings of . each serial and generates
reminders to be sent to the vendor/publisher

for the specified subscription year.
Reminders are also generated one by one by
giving alpha code of the journal or title or
ISSN number whereby it generates reminders
for speciﬁc journals.

(c) Display reminders : This function shows
the number of reminders sent for each
overdue/not received issues of serials.

5.2.6 Bindery Management

The following functions relate to the
management of binding of loose issues of
serial.

I Bindery update

I Bindery order

I Bound volumes

I Back issues

I Checking out of loose issues

(a) Bindery update : On selection of this
function, the system scans the current
holdings of loose issues of various serials and
reports for serials whose volumes are
completed. While listing out the completed
volumes, it assigns a control number to each
complete volume which is used for
subsequent bindery order generation.

(b) Bindery order : This function is used to
generate order for bindery from the records
of the completed volumes. Once the bindery
order has been processed, no more serials
can be added to the order; it can be printed
through the ’reports' function.

(c) Bound volumes : This is to record the
bound volumes received from the bindery so
as to update the collection of a serial. The
accession number is entered for each bound
volume received along with the detailed
information like volume, issue, month, year,
