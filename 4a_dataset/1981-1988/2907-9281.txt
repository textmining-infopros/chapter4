DESIDOC organised a mrkshop on UDC from 18—
23 July 83, at Metcalfe House for benefit of the staff
working in Technical Information Centres/Libraries
attached to the DRDO Lablestts located in the western
zone.

lnaugurating the workshop, Shri SS Murthy,
Director DESIDOC stressed the need for consistency in
classification and indexing systems in DRDO. The parti-
cipants were given assignments to classify documents
comprising books, reports and articles from journals.
The tutorials provided opportunity for detailed dis-
cussion on complex topics which required deep under-
standing of the subiect matter and application of the
principles of classification. The participants were asked
to give feed back on the workshop and they rated the

course very useful.

GUIDELINES FOR TRAINING BROCHURE

Guidelines for preparation of Brochure for
Training Courses Organised by DRDO Labs/Estts were
prepared by DESIDOC and finalised by Dte. of Techni—
cal Training R&D HQrs in consultation with IAT, Pune
ahd DIWS, Mussoorie. These guidelines which relate
to the contents, format and other production aspects
of the brochure/booklet have since been published by
DESIDOC. The guidelines will be helpful to the orga-
nisers of the courses in bringing out booklet] folder of
a unified framework and communicating the required
information to the participants.
