Workshop on Input Preparation
for DESIS

DESIDOC initiated work for the
implementation of the computer
aided ‘Defence Science Information
System (DESIS).‘ In order to train
the personnel who are expected to
prepare the input for the DESIS, a
suitable training programme was
worked out. and a workshop on
‘Input Preparation for DESIS‘ was
organised in DESIDOC from 15 to
21 July 1981. Ten staff members of
DESIDOC attended the workshop.
In his opening address. Shri
S. S. Murthy. Director, DESIDOC.
explained the aims and objectives of
the workshop and also the vital role
the DESIS was expected to play
towards meeting the informa-
tion requirements of the DRDO
scientists.

Besides the lectures tailored to
the workshop, practical assignments
were also given on the usage of
thesaurlm for picking up the des-
criptors, and on ﬁlling up the data
input sheets with various necessary
data elements. Details of punchingi
veriﬁcation of the data and the
fundamentals of database creation
and maintenance were also
discussed. Visit to the BHEL
computer centre at New Delhi was
also arranged to acquaint the parti-
cipants with the working of a
computer. Sarvashri Ambrish
Kumar. U. R. Sharma and V. K.

 

 

Rangra of DESIDOC formed the
faculty.

i This workshop is expected to be
! repeated to cover the participants
from other DRDO Labs Estts also.
