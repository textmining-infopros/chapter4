Many manufacturers offer lists of
accessories along-with the equipment, such
as extra lenses, floor stands, combination
stands, microform
storage
units, and
adaptors for different types of microforms
and other capabilities. The number of operating features, controls, and accessories on any
unit is directly related to its intended
functions and affects cost.

Reader-printers and Enlarger-printers: A
reader-printer is a device both for viewing
and producing occasional hard-copy reproduction from a microform. An enlarger-printer is
generally not used for viewing but rather
used for producing high volumes of hardCOPY.

Future of Microforms
Since printing was invented, there has
never been a period of more rapid and radical development among the information

media than i t has been after the acivent
of microform media. However, the electronic media covering floppy and hard discs,
tapes, etc, appear to replace the inicroform
media, as they facilitate faster storage andretrieval of information. Some information
specialists have predicated the functioning
of paperless offices and libraries by 2000
A D. i n advanced countries. Electronic journal
IS a recent advancement for use on online
terminals. But in recent times, microforms
have acquired a better visual colour effect
due t o the advent of high resolution colour
films. These films give faithful reproduction
of colour tonal values. Microforms would be
preferred against the electronic images or
video display images on vedeo display units
for documents, say i n the field of medicine
describing human systems in colour, and
in similar cases. Reading convenience and cost
aspects also weigh more in favour of microforms for an average reader, as a microform
reader i s cheaper than a video terminal
facility. The trend indicates that future
libraries will serve the users with a combination o f all available recording media. The
new emerging systems will be hybrid system
a combination of all s ~ c htypes of forms and
associated equipment anci gaiigets to meet
the everchanging needs of users. Even then,
the microform will emerge as the most
durable form of storing and distribut~ngthe
information.
