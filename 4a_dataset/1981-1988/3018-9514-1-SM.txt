It is estimated that 48 per cent of the
world's total scientific li'terature is
published in languages other than
English.The language-wisebreak-up of
this set of publications is : Russian
(I$%), German (10%). French (golo),
Japanese (6%), and others (4%). The
D R W scientists working in different
areas must have access to such
literature pertaining to their specialized
fields. Towards this end, DESIDOC has
organized its translation services
backed by its team of well-qualifiedand
experienced translators, who can
translate scientificltechnical materiak
from the languages, such as German,
French, Japanese, and Russian into
English.

Translation Activities
The job of translating documents
(both classified and unclassified) is
'accepted (mainly from DRDO) and
executed by DESIDOC within a
stipulated period. The staff translators
are sometimes called upon to render
on-the-spot translation of documents,
such as manuals, standards, trade
catalogues, instruction leaflets, etc of

urgent nature for the ScientificAdvim~
to Raksha Mantri, Chief Controllers
(Research & Development) and DRDO
HQrs directors. Apart from DRDO,
DESIDOC also caters to the translation
needs of other departments of the
Ministry of Defence.
Every effort is taken to
that the
translations supplied to the indentors
are technically correct p d precise. The
subject of documents translated encompasses all branches of science and
technology, both theoretical and
applied.

Panel of Translators
To cope up with the ever increasing
demand for translation in these four
major languages and in those
categorized 'others' as above, DESIDOC
maintain8 a
panel of external
transistors.
Translation jobs of
unclassified matter are sometimes
assigned to these translators on
c o n t r a c t d basis. In all, DESIDOC is in
a position to entertain translation jobs
from 14 foreign languages into
English.

SoientiBo Abstracts
from
Foreign h q p a g e Journals
Apart from carrying out the
translations on demand, the team of
translators of DESIDOC regularly scans
through hundreds of issues of about
42 foreign-language periodicals on
Defence science subjects, identifies
articles of interest to current and future
Defence R&D activities, and translates
abstracts of these articles into English.
These abstracts are circulated to the
Defence scientists through a quarterly
publication, 'Science Abstracts from
Foreign Language Journals,' brought
out a s a current awareness service. The
feedback of this service in terms of
requests for full translation of the
articles is quite encouraging.

It bps been obsefired that due to lack
of knowledge about the availability of
translations, a lot of duplication work
is going on which is time consuming
and costly at the same time. To avoid
duplication in the translation effort, a
Translation Bank has been set up,
which acts as a central repository of all
the unclassified translations already
done and procured by DESIDOC. The
various activities carried out in this area
include :
(i) maintenance of a manual and
machine-readable index of the
translations done by DESIDOC;
(ii) bibliographical dewls of the
translation holdings of other
major translation centres in the
country, namely, Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre, Indian National
Scientific Ihoumentation Centre,
Indian
SF
Research
Organimtion, Bharat Heavy
Electrids Ltd, Bureau of Indian
Standards, National Aeronautical
Laboratory, etc; ami

(iii) announcement of the citations of

DESlDOC translations through
various publications for the
benefit
of
the
scientific
community as a whole.
Every request received for translation
is checked for its availability in the
Translation Bank through various
indexes. If it is found available, a copy
of the translation is sent immediately.
If it is not available, only then the
document is passed on to the concerned
language group for undertaking the
translation job. In case of urgent and
volumhous documents, an access is
sometimes
also
made
to the
international translation banks for
procurement of the translations. All
translations done and procured by
DESIDOC are announced periodically
through the various national and
international publications. They are :
'World Translation Index (WTI)'
(monthly), published by International
Translation Centre, The Netherlands;
'National Index of Tranelation (?TIT)'
(monthly), INSDOC, New Delhi;
'DESIDOC Bulletin' (bi-monthly) and
'DESIDOC Transindex' (annually),both
published by DESIDOC.

On the basis of information supplied
to the scientists through these
publications, a large number of
requests are being received not only
from DRDO labslestts but also from
other government departments, Govt of
India undertakings, renowned private
enterprises of India, UK,USA, France,
etc. The supply of copies of translations
to the DRDO labdestts is significantly
high. The supply to the private and
foreign agencies is made only in
exceptional cases. The total number of
translations supplied have increased
from 4,000 pages in 1985to about 7,000
pages in 1989.

Thrust Areas
DESIDOC propo8es to set up the
following projects in the near future :
8

A terminology bank to help keep
a systematic, machine-readable,
correct, and contextual meaning
of newly-coined words and
expressions, accessible online to
the professional translators. This
will also help in developing
discipline-wise the dictionaries
and glossaries in electronic form,
which are likely to be a good
source of earning revenue.

A language labomtory for a

thorough regular exercise of the
foreign language in its latest
audidvideo
forms
through
facilitiesproposed to be organized
in the laboratory. The proposed
laboratory will serve the people
who are interested to do
interpretation
job
as
a
profesaionhobby or for such
scientists as are interested to
update their knowledge in
comprehension and stylistic
expression.
