EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES *
S S Mutthy

1. CONCEPT AND DEFlNlTlON
An expert system (ES) acts as an expert
or a consultant in some subject area and helps
in decision-making in unstructured problem
The expert systems comprise computer programs modelled after human experts.
These systems rely heavily on knowledge,
especially knowledge of their domain2. These
systems store information relevant to the problem domain and seek to emulate problemsolving
methods of human experts.
Many definitions of ES have been provided by
experts in this field, but the one given by the
British Computer Society Expert Systems
Specialist Group (BCS ESSG) appears to be
adequate and comprehensive
"An expert system is regarded as the embodiment within a computer of a knowledge based
component, from an expert skill, in such a
form that the system can offer intelligent advice
or take an intelligent decision about a processing
function. A desirable additional characteristic,
which many would consider fundamental, is
the capability of the system, on demand, to

justify i t s own line of reasoning in a manner
directly intelligible to the enquirerw3

2.STRUCTURE AND OPERATION
A simplified form of an ES structure is given
below :

KNOWLEDGE BASE

Computer programs normally organise knowledge at two levels- data and program. According to Yaghmai and ~axin4mostexpert systems
organise knowledge a t three levels-data,
knowledge base and control.
The database of an ES system contains the
data that is used for providing expert advice.
This database keeps track of input data for the
current problem, the status of the current

4.2.1 Subject Classification
Classification of documents was considered
as a problem of pattern recognition in the ES
studies. Since the classification i s generally
based on the subject content of the documents
which can be represented either by codes (class
numbers) or by keywords, the system matches
the subject content of a new addition to the
library collection with the existing codes or
keywords for achieving automatic classification.
Earlier studies in automatic classification used
factor analysis or other clustering algorithms
to create subject matching or subject associations
based on keywords in the text5. Although
these studies were helpful in demonstrating
the possibilities of automatic classification, they
were not adequate to handle large collections.
Further work in this direction is in progress.

4.2.2 Cataloguing
There are different sets of rules for cataloguing. 4 scrutiny of any of these rules would
convince any one that there are many complexities in the cataloguing function, particularly
n entering the authorship of a document o i
work. An expert system can store the rules
according to a particular code and apply after
taking appropriate decisions with regard to the
authorship, type of document, linkage between
multiple volumes of document and so on. An ES
model for cataloguing6 of maps was recently
developed at the University College of Los
Angeles (UCLA) on similar lines with MYCIN,
an expert system on diagnosis of infectious
diseases.

Another application of ES in this area could
be the development of a suitable system for
applying relevant cataloguing rules to a
document while the text of the document is
still under electronic composition.

4.2.3 Reference Service
A prototype ES for reference service was
designed and tested at UCLA in 1980 using a
TRS 80 microcomputer. The system was called
REFLES- Reference Librarian Enhancement
System. The objective of the system was to enhance the performance of a reference librarian
by providing him access to ephemeral data,
non-current data and data derived from knowledge of local resources. The study showed that
with improved hardware and software facilities,
the system could be augmented to encompass
other reference material, search strategy development and user participation making it a true
expert system.
Vickery and 6rooks7 describe an ES developed at the University of London, titled
PLEXUS covering the subject of gardening.
This system was expected to provide reference
service based on the description of the information requirement given by the user, and by
supplementing the user's. statement with additional search terms or concepts from the
knowledge base of the system and by making
the *search strategy that could be applied to a
'database. The development of i t s prototype
took, about 20 months and further work is in
progress.

4 . 2 4 lndexing
lndexing of documents i s highly subjective
relative to the types of users, their specialisations, the depth of indexing required to be done
for meeting individual requirements of users, the
reading habits of the users and so on. Slant in
indexing to provide access to the information
required by different user groups from the same
document i s also an important factor. So, an ES,
which would store knowledge to satisfy different
view points of the users and retrieves information
that matches their specific requirements, can be
highly useful.

4.2.5 Specialised Thesauri
The quality of a good thesaurus is to be
measured by its ability in recognising and incorporating new subject fields, ignoring obsolete

ones autornat\ca\\y, No single thesaurus would
normally meet such requirements unless it is
specially designed for the system and is constantlv updated, On the other hand, the ES
which can take care of the changing requirements of the users of the t R system and can
constantly update the thesaurus based on i t s
expert knowbadge. Such an ES would be highly
useful for \R system in general. No such ES
appears to have yet been developed.

4.26 Information Retrieval
For retrieving information from a cornputerised IR system, the practice has been that the
user either himself provides a search expression
or describes the information requirement from
which the search expression and a search strategy
are worked out by an information specialist.
The search is then conducted and the feedback
is discussed by the information specialist with
the user and the search expression modified as
necessary and searches are again conducted till
the user gets the most relevant information
possible. Stodies using ES for information
retrieval induded automatic formulation of
search strategy and search expression based on
the inputs provided by user through a men3
provided by the system. The user gives bis own
version of his infarmation requirement using his
own terminology, The heuristic procedures used
by the system, using i t s database and the knowledge base select the appropriate vocabulary,
and formu\ate Ithe search strategy and conduct
the search. Further modifications in the search,
based on the feedback prodded by the user,
are also carried out automatically, The system
also attaches weights to the march terms based
on i t s structured dialogue with the user, and
i n the repeated searches the weimts are also
modified suitably,

An ES entit\ed C O N S E A R ~was recently
designed to enable doctors to specify queries
to retrieve cancer- therapy related documents
stored in the MEDLINE database of the US
National Library of Medicine. The system
embodies the expert knowledge of a tibrarian
functioning as an intermediary between the
physician and the database.

4.2.7 Publishing
Some traditional reference publications like
Bei{stein9s Handbuch der Organischen
are not only difficult to comaile but are CQmp\i.
cated to use. Some publications like, directarieJ
and handbooks get outdated before they are
distributed. Development of a suitable ES for
providing up-to-date and ready data or infor.
rnation t o answer specific queries incofporating
expert advice to a particular problem for which
the query is made, would be highly valuable.
As the information explosion continues,
reviews and digests covering the litergture output
in specific fields, have become very valuable to
the working scientists as well as the busy technocrats or executives. So, an ES which automatically prepares up-to-date digests with different
subject slants to meet the requirements of
different users and linked with an electronic
publishing system to provide on-the-spot copier
of the digestsJor reviews, would be greatly
welcomed by these busy users,

5. FUNDING of E%
)n USA alone a substantial amount ($ 10
million} is being spent by US government on
some of the ES systems and $ 2 million under
government contracts to non-profit organisafjons
and universities. Same of the ESsystems funded
by US government are: Diagnosis of infectious
diseases (MYCIN), Oedema patients (PIP),
Diagnosis and treatment for glaucoma
(CASENET), and knowledge acquisition and
problem formulation (ROGET). ES research
sites in USA include universities, non-pmfit
arganisations, government depts and industrial
units.

6. CONCLUSION
As stated earlier, the use of ES for library
and intormation services is not yet very common,
and significant achievements in this area are
still to take place, althaugh some studies have

been made. These studies have demonstrated
the high potential for the use of ES in the
libraries and for information storage, retrieval
and dissemination services including electronic
publishing. In India, computerisation of library

and information services has recently received
a momentum with various national agencies
actively carrying out work in this area and it
will not be long before use of ES i s also made
for operating these information services.

My message to the managers and administrators i s t o care for their workers, to treat them like
human beings and not like cogs in a machine. Only then will they be able to motivate them and
carry them together in a team.
