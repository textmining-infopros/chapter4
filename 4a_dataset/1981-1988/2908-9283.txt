film on the role of DRDO for Defence was arranged with
Delhi Doordarshan. The TV documentary on 0800 was
telecast on 14 Jan 1984 in the National Programme. The
film was highly appreciated by the Scientific Adviser to
Raksha Mantri, the Chief Controllers of R&D and several
Directors of DRDO Labs/Estts.

A number of articles were prepared by DESIDOC on
the achievements of DRDO in various fields, for publication
in Sainik Samachar, R8iD Digest and for circulation to the
media. Other publicity material like calendars. stickers, exhi-
bition posters were also designed, printed and distributed by
DESIDOC. It also participated in 'DRDO E-xposition' held at
Pragati Maidan, New Delhi from 13-29 Jan 1984.

accessioned by the Library during this period. The subject
covered by these books included Library Science}
Documentation, Military ScienCe, Polymer Science, Remote
Sensing, Managementland Metallurgy.

Over 745 books/periodicals and 50 reports were
issued on loan to SO to SA, CCR&D (K), SA to CAS, SA to

0%,th Labs/Estts and Delhi University.

About 8490 Xerox copies of documents were also

PATENTS HOLDING IN DRDO

Patents are an important source of scientific and
technical information. Nearly quarter of a million patents are
published in English language alone each year. Information on
new processes and products first appears in patents and some-
times these are the only source of detailed description of a
new innovation. Some of the information contained in patents
may be subsequently incorporated in reports, periodicals or
monographs, etc. but much of it never appears in these more
accessible forms of publications. Moreover, most of the DRDO
Labs/Estts are receiving patent literature which is not known
to other sister Labs/Estts and therefore is not being used
optimally.

In view of the usefulness of the patent literature,
DESIDOC has initiated an effort to compile a handy infor-
mation tool in the form of Union Catalogue of Patent Litera-
ture held by 0800 Labs/Estts for the benefit of DRDO
scientists. Data obtained for Union Catalogue of Patent
Literature is under processing and the Catalogue will be
brought out soon.

ON-LINE TERMINAL AT DESIDOC

An on—line terminal which is hooked to the main
computer system located in the Metcalfe House Complex,
has been installed at DESIDOC Library. The terminal is also
connected to the DRDO HOrs at Sena Bhavan through the
communication network PRIMENET.

The terminal is being used by the scientific staff
for onsline searching of DRDO-IRS database (the database
that is being organised by DESIDOC) in an interactive mode.
In addition to this, the terminal is being used for regular
bibliographic data processing jobs and also for operation
of SDI services against user interest profiles.

It is proposed to computerise the circulation system
of library books and reports etc.
