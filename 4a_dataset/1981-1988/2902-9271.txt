Dec 1981. The course was designed
to equip the trainees with the latest
techniques in reprography, micro—
ﬁlming. ﬁlm processing and colour
photography. Due emphasis was
laid in practiculs supported by
necessary theory to give the partici-
pants a clear idea of the concepts
and some practice in using the
techniques. Since it was felt that
individual attention could be paid
to the trainees if they are in a small
number. the course was organised
for the DRDO Lablestts situated
in North India. This Course is i
expected to be repeated to cover the
concerned staff of other DRDO
Labs also. The course was inaug

rated by Prof. M. KrishnamurttQ
