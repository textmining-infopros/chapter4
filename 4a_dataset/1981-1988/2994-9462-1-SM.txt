Abstract
Explains briefly broad areas o f reprography. Describes xerographic
process and growth of the reprographic industry with special reference
to plain paper copier (PPC). Gives criteria for selection of PPC and
tabulates data o f four prominent full colour PPCs. Gives details o f a new
portable colour PPC. Discusses the problem o fcopyright inphoto-copying
and charging for the photocopy/xerox service.

Reprography Defined
The term reprography was first introduced
at the First International Congress on
Reprography held in Cologne, Germany in
1963.Landau defines it as "the art of producing
single or multiple copies of documents whether
by photographic or other means." Ibrahim calls
it a "technology of producing or reproducing
visual communication in an inplant operation."
Harrod gives a more comprehensive definition
as "the reproduction in facsimile of documents
of all kind by any process using light, heat or
electric radiation-photocopies, microcopies,

blue prints, electrocopies, thermocopies, etc;
also reproduction by methods of duplicating
and office printing."

Areas of Reprography
Reprography, thus broadly includes
photocopy, microcopy, duplicating, and
in-house printing and in general, is
characterised by its small scale of operations
and non m s s i o n a l nature of its operatives.

reproduction. Micrography deals in images of
reduced size i.e. microforms (microfilm &
microfiche) which require some special
apparatus - viewers/readers - to make them
readable. The more popular among them is
the reader-printer whkh enables a microform
to be viewed or read as well as yields a copy
of the same, if so desired. Duplicating includes
spirit duplicating, stencil duplicating (also
known as mimeographing), and gelatin
process. Small scale offset printing is
indistinguishable from duplicating. Even offset
(litho) machines are often described by their
manufacturers as 'offset duplicators.'

categories. These are : a) photographic - the
sensitive coating being silver halide as in the
conventionalphotography; b) diazo or dyeline;
c) themographic or heatcopying, and d)
electrostatic or electrophotographic copying.
The configuration these process is depicted in

Selection of Reprographic Methods

Xerography Process

Several points need to be considered while
choosing a reprographic system. These
include : running cost (cost per copy), capital
cost, number of copies required, type of the
original to be copied (bound volumes,
drawings, over-sized documents, etc), colour
of the reproduced copy (BIW or colour),speed
and convenience of use, skills required for
operation, and durability (life of the copy).

Chester Carlson of the US produced the first
electrostatic copy on 22 Oct 1938. Later, the
process was named 'xerography,' a Greek
word for dry writing : copying without moist
paper or chemicals. Various steps involved in
the process include :
an electric charge is given to a selenium
surface having metal backing. Selenium
does not allow the charge to leak away to
the metal while it is kept in the dark;
the image of the original to be copied
is projected on to the selenium surface.
The light from the non-text areas allows
the electric charge to disperse to the
metal, but the text being dark reflects

Photocopying Processes
Based on the chemistry of the process and
also on the nature of the sensitive surface on
which the copy is made, the photocopying
processes could be grouped into four

The electrostatic or electrophotographic
method better known as xerography has scored
over all the other methods in terms of
economy, speed and use in operation, the main
considerations in adopting a photocopying
system.

no light and so the charge is held where
the text falls on the selenium surface.
Thus, an invisible pattern of electric
charge remains in the shape of the text or
other marks on the original;
to make the text visible, carbon powder
with opposite electric charge is cascaded
over the selenium surface. The powder
sticks to the surface;
paper is brought against the surface and
by means of further electric charge, the
powder is transferred to the paper;
the paper is heated to fuse the carbon on
it. Carbon being a very stable substance,
gives the electrophotographic copies the
advantage of permanence.

Xerography and Electrofax
Copying on to plain paper is the original
xerography. When coated paper (with zinc
oxide) is used, the same process is called
Electrofax. The advantages of using coated
paper are that the reproduction of tone
illustration is better than in xerography and that
every copy is in effect a lithographic plate - it
can be used to obtain a hundred or so copies
on a small offset machine.
Growth of Xerox Technology

In 1950, xerox machines were made
available to public. In 1960, the Xerox 914,
named because of its ability to make copies
upto 9" x 14" size, was introduced. Since
then many sophisticated models have come
into the market.
The first indigenous, commercially available
automatic copier known as 'Oce 1250
Electrocopier' was introduced in India by the
Das Reprographics Ltd., Calcutta, which used
zinc oxide coated paper. Later, the Advani
Oedikon Pvt.Ltd. introduced 'AutodOO' plain
paper copier. There are about 20 firms which
are producing PPCs in India. At present, Modi
Xerox (Modiin collaboration with Rank Xerox)
dominates the Indian scene with 43.2 per cent

of their market share This year they have
introduced the '1038' model - a
programmable desktop copier with many
value-added features. But all these xerox
models available in the Indian market are black
and white. The colour models are yet to be
introduced in India.

PPC Market
The plain paper copier (PPC) market is
growing very fast. The number of installed
copiers in the US by the end of 1987 reached
4.2 million. The ten top makers of PPC in the
world are Canon, Xerox, Sharp, Savin,
Minolta, Mita, Konica, Harris/3M, Ricoh and
Toshiba which control more than 85 per cent
of the US market, the first three accounting 50
per cent.

Colour Copier Technologies
The first colour copier was introduced by 3M
Company in 1974. The technologies being
used in colour copier are electrographic,
photographic, thermal transfer and cycolor.
The comparison of these technologies in the
production of quality colour copies is given in
Table 2.
Criteria for Selection of a colour PPC
While selecting a colour PPC, the features
that may be noted for comparison include :
type, imaging technique, copy paper size,
paper capacity, warm-up time, copying speed,
reproduction ratio (enlargement and/or
reduction), copy colour, density control,
multiple copies, dimensionsand weight, power
supply consumption, etc. The price of a colour
PPC is about $20,000 upward.
Some Colour P R 3
A comparative study of some of the full
colour PFC models, namely, Brother CC 5500,
Canon CLC, Canon BJ-A1, sharp CX-7500,
in the terms of technical specifications and
consumers' requirement is given in the

A Multipurpose Portable Colour PPC

Charging for Supply of Photocopies

Panasonic has introduced a light-weight
colour copier with several new features
satisfying the needs of the new generation of
copier users. Its model, COPILMAN. FN-500,
weighs only 6 kg, has 1 4 colours with copying
magnification of 50, 100 and 200 per cent. It
has the potential of producing hard copies of
W N C R screen images (with the help of an
adapter).

Should the photocopying service be
charged? The answer lies in the policy of
servicing institution. In a Government R&D
institution where the users are the employees
who are dependent on such service, it may not
be advisable to levy any kind of charge. But
the misuse must be curbed. On a single request
which should be once a day, only one copy
of one paper normally of not more than 10
pages, may be entertained. The indenter may
give an undertaking in hidher request that the
photocopy is required purely for research1
teachinglofficial purpose and that no
commercial gain of any kind will be made out
of it.

Problem of Copyright
Photocopying (in broader sense, any kind of
machine reproduction) comes under the
provisions of copyright and affects the
document supply services of libraries and
information centres. In the world over, the
doctrine of 'fair use' permits reproduction for
legitimate purpose of material taken hom a
copyrighted work to a limited extent, that will
not cut into the copyright owner's potential
market for sale of copies. Under the term
'fair use' are covered criticism, comments,
news reporting, teaching, scholarship or
research. In the US, some guidelines have been
laid down for this purpose under which a
teacher or hidher agent (e.g. librarian) can
make one copy of a copyrighted work for
research/teaching or preparation thereof.
Multiple copying for classroom use is allowable
only if it meets the test of brevity, spontaneity
and cumulative effect. The Indian Copyright
Act 1957 as amended in 1983 also permits
reproduction of copies when made in the
course of fair dealing and for educational or
official purposes.
