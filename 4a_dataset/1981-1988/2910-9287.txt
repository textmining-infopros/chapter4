~ON-LINE ACCESS TO UNPUBLISHED TRAINING COURSE ON COMPUTER

SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATIONS APPLICATION
by . . . . .
S. C. saxena DESIDOC organised a training course on Applica-

tion of Computer to Library and Information Work'
under its Users’ Education & Training Programme during
25—30 June 1984 at Delhi. The course was attended by
officers and staff working in Technical Information
Centres/Libraries of DRDO-‘Establishments. Shri SS
Murthy, DESIDOC while inaugurating the
course stressed the need of modernising the library 81
information systems by computerisation, especially when
the costs of computer systems are coming down with the
emergence of microprocessors.

In recent years, the translations of scientiﬁc and
technical documents have been gaining importance as
-a source of information. Before 1980, only published
translations, such as cover-to—cover, could be searched
on-line because these were included in various national
and international bibliographical data—bases along with
other documents. Now unpublished translations can also
be searched on-Iine. The International Translations Centre
(ITC), Delft, Netherlands developed a data-base on trans-
lations (published and unpublished) known as WORLD
TRANSINDEX DATA-BASE and made it available
on-Iine since September 1980 as file-33 on ESAlIRS
(European Space Agency Information Retrieval Service)
'Frascati, Italy. The manual INFORMASCIENCE for
operating World Transindex Data-Base is published
jointly by the ITC and Central Nationale de La Recherche
Scientifique (CNRS). On-line information search on
translations can be carried out by various approaches
viz; target/source languages, source documents, year of
publication, title, author, subject, etc.

Director,

The topics covered in the course were: computer
basics, PRIME (computer) commands, DRDO-IRS, use
of thesaurus, construction of user profile, preparation
of input, data entry and data base searching. Special
lectures were delivered on Computer Application in
Library Operations' by Shri R Satyanarayana (INSDOC),
'Software Packages' by Dr DK Bandhyopadhya (INSDOC)
and 'Access to On-Iine Data Bases' by Shri SS Murthy.
The course laid stress on practical work, such as document
analysis and selection of keywords, filling up of input
sheets, data entry into computer and use of terminal
for data-base searching, where the participants had the
opportunity of applying the techniques learnt during the
course.

World Transindex Dataobase includes translations
of serial and non—serial publications from East—European
and Asian languages such as Russian, Japanese, Czech,
Polish, Chinese, etc. into West European languages viz.
English, German, French and Spanish. It also contains
translations from Western languages into French, Spanish
and Portuguese. In the field of science and technology
alone, about 32,000 new translations are added to this
data-base every year from all the source languages into
i all the target languages.

The faculty of the Course included Dr JR Arora
and Dr A Gupta of DRDO Computer Centre and 8/
Shri Ambrish Kumar, RK Srivastava, VK Rangra and
technical staff of DESIDOC. The participants were
given objective type test on completion of the course. The
feedback provided by the participants rated the course
as very useful.

Prof M Krishnamurthi, CCR&D in his valedictory
address, said that information knew no barriers of space
and for mutual sharing of information, it is necessary that
information processing and dissemination should be
standardised which can be best achieved by use of the
computer. He appreciated the importance of this course
and hoped that in future such courses Would be organised
by DESIDOC for the benefit of Defence Information
Scientists.

Shri Ambrish Kumar, Sci '8‘ acted as the course
Director.

World Transindex Data-base Is produced using
PASCAL lll system developed by the CN RS, Paris. This
database includes bibliographic details of translations
collected by the ITC and CNRS since Jan'uary 1978.
Its first by-product is the World Transindex.a monthly
announcement bulletin. The project, to include data on
translations processed by the ITC before January 1978, is
under consideration. Extension of this data-base covering
all translations, called INTERWESTERN translations,
is also under study.

In India, however, there is no computerized data
base on translations but the activity of bibliographic
control of unpublished translations is gaining momentum.
Recently, many agencies such as BARC, NAL, BHEL,
DESIDOC, CLRI, etc. have started publishingtheir indexes
on unpublished translations, INSDOC started
publication of National Index of translations (NIT)
since January 1981. NIT lists all the unpublished trans-
IatiOns carried out within India. Under the international
cooperation programme, INSDOC sends a copy of the
NIT to ITC for including translations done in India in
the World Transindex data-base. Thus, these translations
can also be searched on-line in the World Transindex data-
base Besides this, BARC sends bibliographic information
on translations (done at BARC) to various international

organisations directly such as, Energy Research and
Development Administration (USA), ITC, etc. NAL
also sends bibliographic information on NAL-Translations
to National Technical Information Service (USA), Inter-
national Translation Centre, Commission of the European
Economic Communities, Luxemburg; National Trans-
lations Centre (USA) and ASLIB, London under its
liaeion programme.

while

On-line networks are yet to be implemented in India
and efforts are being made by NAL, DESIDOC, etc. to
implement such systems. The delay in the development

or implementation is clue to non-compatibility amen:
the computers, non-availability of proper communicati ‘:
lines, manpower, resources, etc.

  
  
   
    
  
   
 
   
  
  
 
   
  

Efforts are also being made at DESIDOC to provi_
access to unpublished translations held by its Translatio‘
Bank. Preliminary trial run for computerizing informati;
on these translations was carried out in 1981 on UNIVA
1100 computer at BHEL, New Delhi, by using softwar
package written in Cobol (ASCII). Then data on tran
lations were processed by using same package on PRIM
750 system available at DRDO Computer Centre, Metcal 
House, Delhi. DESIDOC has developed software for creari.
ing data-base of scientific information and for on-Iin'
searching and on PRIME-7 m
system. A terminal of this system has been installed i.
DESIDOC for searching information on-line.
