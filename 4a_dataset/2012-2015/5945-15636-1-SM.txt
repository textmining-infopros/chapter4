 The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  analyse  the  application  of  Bradford’s  Law  of  Scattering  to  the  Psoriasis  literature  published  during  1960-2009.  Psoriasis  is  a  kind  of  skin  disease  prevalent  all  over  the  world. The  therapy  of  mild-to-moderate  Psoriasis  has  come  a  long  way  from  the  days  of  tar  and  anthralin,  though  the  latter  treatments  are  still  occasionally  used. The  paper  presents  an  overview  on  scholarly contribution presented on Bradford law applied in different studies both theoretical as well as  practical aspects of the law and it is being tested here over Psoriasis literature. The data for this study  has been taken from PubMed for the period of 50 years (1960-2009) and it yielded 24031 citations. A  ranked  list  of  journals  has  been  prepared  and  it  is  found  that British  Journal  of  Dermatology   is  most  productive journal which has published 8.54 % article on psoriasis. As far as the implication of Bradford  law is concern, in theoretical aspect this law does not ft, but the alternatives such as Leimkuhler model  
holds good for Psoriasis literature.

1. IntroductIon 
There have been various bibliometric or related  studies of literature published for various diseases.  These meta-reviews of literature through bibliometric  analysis reflect the intellectual capital of the field both  in  research  productivity  and  research  impact.  The  basis of the literature analysis is lies in the source of  information for it. For Bibliometric studies, the most  reliable source is ‘Science Citation Index’ published  by  Institute  of  Scientific  Information,  Philedelphia.  The  other  sources  are  Scopus  database,  covers  engineering  disciplines  extensively  and  PubMed  database  dedicated  to  medicine  and  scientific  literature.  Nowadays,  the  Google  scholar  is  also  being utilised as a source of information for citation  data,  but  not  as  extensive  as  information  available  in Science Citation Index or Scopus. The reliabilities  of  the  bibliometric  analysis  lies  on  which  sources  are selected, which selection criteria is applied and  how these criteria are founded in an understanding  of  the  scholarly  communication  process1. 
The  publication  behaviour  of  potential  authors  and  the  importance  of  source  in  which  they  wish  to  publish  has  been  a  major  research  topic  in  the  field  of  information  science.  This  issue  has  been  felt  when  SC  Bradford  analysed  the  publication  of  engineering  disciples  in  1953.  He  generalised  the  phenomenon which illustrates that ‘article of interest  to a specialist must not only occur in the periodical  of specialised subject, but also from other periodical  
Received 4 August 2013, online published 17 January 2014 
from  time  to  time,  which  grow  in  number  as  the  relation of their field to that subject lessens and the  number of articles on his subject in each periodical  diminishes’2.These observations later were known as  ‘Bradford  Law  of  Scattering’  which  describes  how  documents  in  a  subject  are  statistically  distributed  among  the  publishing  source.  
In  every  field  of  research,  there  are  some  popular  journals  which  are  frequently  referred  and  authors  wish  to  publish  in  those  journals  because  of  close  relationship  with  the  field  of  research  field  and  journal.  These  are  referred  as  core  journals.  In  case  of  medical  science,  engineering  and  technology  fields  the  large  number  of  journals  is  available  for  publication  of  research  outcomes.  The  assignments  of  core  journals  in  these  areas  are  essential  task  for  information  science,  to  help  the scientists to choose right journal for publishing  pertinent  research. Arguing  to  the  statement  came  from  Bradford,  in  1979,  Garfield  given  a  different  version  of  the  statement  which  illustrates  that  the  there is overlapping of the journal while publication  and  this  was  better  known  as  Garfield’s  Law  of  Concentration.  According  to  this,  the  tail  of  the  literature  of  one  disciple  consists  of  the  cores  of  the  literature  of  other  disciplines.  So  large  is  the  overlap between disciplines, that the core literature  for  all  the  scientific  disciplines  involves  a  group  of  no  more  than  1000  journals  and  may  involve  as  few as 5003,4. Garfield illustrated that in each field,

practitioners  can  easily  identify  the  most  important  journals  publishing  highest  quality  of  materials.  To  solve  this  empirical  formulation,  the  measure  has  been  adopted;  one  of  such  measure  is  the  impact  factor  (IF)  of  the  journals  and  considers  them  scholarly journals. Different studies have quantified  the scholarly journal in their study to mark journals  as scholarly5-7. This preliminary investigation has laid  the foundation of the study to test the implication of  Bradford  law  in  the  area  of  Psoriasis  research.  
Psoriasis  is  an  inflammatory  skin  condition.  The  obvious  sign  is  the  colour  change  associated  with  the  plaques  (the  raised  patches  on  the  skin.  Psoriasis  is  a  chronic,  recurrent  inflammatory  skin  disease that affects 2–3 % of the population in the  uK.  Fairskinned  people,  wherever  they  live,  are  equally  affected  by  Psoriasis,  but  it  is  much  less  common  in  African,  Caribbeans,  and  Asians;  and  virtually  non-existent  in  Inuit  people  and  Native  Americans. Various studies show the prevalence of  the Psoriasis in different regional and ethenic group  and  their  effect  on  human  population8-13. 
Psoriasis  on  its  own  can  be  a  serious  disease  and  more  than  enough  for  someone  to  cope  with,  but  when  it  is  complicated  by  other  diseases  such  as arthritis14, heart attack15, diabetes16, it has adverse  effect on health. About 10 % of people with psoriasis  are  thought  to  have  arthritis  as  well,  but  the  real  number  may  be  higher  as  not  everyone  reports  it  or link it to the psoriasis. In today’s National Health  Service,  there  is  great  emphasis  on  informing  and  empowering  patients,  and  this  applies  as  much  to  people with long-term (chronic) skin problems such  as  psoriasis  as  to  those  with  other  diseases17.  Thus  such  kind  of  literature  which  has  enunciated  a  much  debate  on  the  different  issue  related  to  this  disease  and  attracted  the  attention  of  medical  scientists towards it for diagnostic and in search of  better treatment solution to cure this disease. At the  same  time,  the  scientists  are  also  looking  ahead  to  the  pertinent  literature  on  such  topics  as  well  as  publishing  their  results  in  prominent  places  in  order to fetch the attention of the masses to those  literatures. Bibliometric study in this regard helping  the  research  community  in  analysing  the  trends  of  publication  in  different  scientific  and  technical  field  and  helping  the  scientists  to  choose  right  kind  of  the  source.  This  study  is  also  taken  with  same  motives  to  investigate  the  patterns  of  publication  in  the  area  of  psoriasis  research  and  investigate  the  patterns  of  publication  through  Bradford  law  of  scattering.      
2.   oB jectIveS 
The  major  objective  of  this  study  is  to  analyse  the dispersion pattern of journals publishing Psoriasis  literature. Based on this dispersion study, to prepare  
a  ranked  list  of  journals  and  test  the  Bradford’s  law  of  scattering. 
3. MethodoLogy 
The  data  for  this  study  was  collected  from  PubMed  database  of  NCBI,  uSA.  A  ranked  list  of  journals  prepared  based  on  the  most  productive  journals  publishing  Psoriasis  literature.  A  total  of  24031  references  have  been  retrieved  from  the  database and taken into consideration for the study.  It  is  found  that  the  2143  journals  have  produced  24031  documents  during  the  period  of  1960-2009.  These 2143 journals have been analysed to test the  Bradford  laws  to  see  the  patterns  of  publications  in  these  journals. 
To test the Bradford observation over the literature  in  the  field  of  Psoriasis,  the  whole  literature  has  been  divided  into  three  zones  or  groups.  The  conclusion  derived  by  the  Bradford  states  that  the  ratio  of  the  titles  of  journal  in  successive  zones  followed  a  common  pattern  and  it  states  as  if  scientific journals are arranged in order of decreasing  productivity  of  articles  on  a  given  subject,  they  may  be  divided  into  a  nucleus  of  periodicals  more  particularly  devoted  to  the  subject  and  there  are  several  groups  or  zones  containing  same  number  of periodicals in the nucleus and succeeding zones  will  be  in  1:  n:  n2,  where  n   is  a  multiplier 
18 
  and  the  observation  of  Bradford  later  described  as  linear relation by Brookes19  which is expressed as:    F(x)=  a+b  logx 
where, F(x) is the cumulative number of references  contained in the first x  most productive journals, and  a and b are constant. Brookes linear expression of  Bradford  law  is  most  widely  used  formulation. 
Again, Vikery20  extended the verbal formulation  of  the  Bradford  law  to  show  that  its  application  in  any  number  of  zones  of  equal  values.  Later  on  Leimkuhler21 has  given  a  simple  expression  of  Bradford law which is later known by his name and  its  is  expressed  as: 
R(r)  = a   log(1+ br) 
where,  R(r)  is  the  cumulative  number  of  articles  contributed  by  journals  ranked  1  through r,  and a  and b   are  parameters.  Similarly,  Brooks  derivation  of  journals  productivity  takes  the  form  
R(r)  = a   log( b/r) 
Further,  wilkinson22   noticed  that  the  formulae  provided by Leimkuhler and Brookes did not describe  the same phenomenon. Several other mathematicians  provided  different  models  but  the  Brookes  and  Bradford  laws,  however,  gained  more  acceptance  than  others.

which  can  be  drawn  from  the  Bradford  law,  where  small  number  of  core  journals  occupy  the  nucleus  of  papers  in  a  given  subject.  This  occupancy  is  related  in  a  linear  expression  where  a  substantial  percentage (about one third) of the articles accounts  for it, followed by a second larger group of journals  accounts for another one third and where as much  larger  group  of  journals  have  last  third.  This  law  is  popularly  known  as  Bradford  Law  of  Scattering.  The  theoretical  interpretation  of  the  Bradford  law   was  tested  from  time  to  time  for  various  subject  literatures  and  the  given  hypothesis  was  proved  or  disproved,  and  also  alternatives,  analogy  and  models  have  been  suggested  from  time  to  time.  Some  of  such  studies  where  this  law  is  applied  to  test  its  applicability  is  on  study  of  doctoral  thesis  citation  at  Indian  Institute  of  Science23,  growth  of  literature  and  ranking  of  biochemistry  journals24,  theoretical  population  genetics25,  etc.  Some  of  the  research  using  literature  scattering  and  Bradford  law  model  related  to  the  testing  its  validity  with  other  models  includes  application  of  Bradford  law  to  the  calculation  of  Leimkuhler’s  law  and  some  literature  focuses  on  the  problems  associated  with  the  application  of  Bradford  Law26. 
Based  on  these  literatures  it  is  concluded  that  the  Bradford  did  not  give  mathematical  model,  but  the model came from Brooks, Vickery and Leimkuhler.  Sudhier27   experimented  the  model  proposed  by  Leimkuhler  and  Bradford  law  for  assessing  their  utilities  in  dispersion  of  literature  in  a  study  of  doctoral thesis citation at Indian Institute of Science  and  it  is  given  as  under.  In  this  study  he  explains  the  Leimkuhler  model  expressed  in  the  form  of  verbal  formulation  of  Bradford  law  as: 
R(r)= a   log(1+ br),  r  =  1,  2,  3             (1) 
Egghe28   explained  Leimkuhler  model  as 
(2) 
(3)  
k=  (1.781ym)1/p  and                         (7)  y 
0 
  =  A/p,  where  A  is  the  total  number  of  articles. 
Again,  let  T  represents  the  total  number  of  journals in Bradford zone, then there are r0ki-1 sources  would  constitute  the  group  (i  =  1,  2,  3,….p) 
T   =  r0   +  r k2   +  …………+  r kp-2              (8) 
So, r0   =  T0/1+k+k 
0 
2+...+kp-1 
  =  T(k-1)/(kp-1) (9) 
From this, one is able to derive the value of A  and T, r0   and  y0   can  be  calculated  by  expression  using Eqn. (7) which gives the value of p. This whole  expression  is  tried  here  to  justify  the  application  of  Bradford  law  and  Leimkuhler  model  to  test  their  fitness  of  good  for  the  literature  in  Psoriasis.

5.1   g rowth  of  Literature 
During  1960  and  2009,  24031  articles  indexed  in  PubMed  database  on  Psoriasis  and  it  is  found  that  there  is  a  global  increase  in  the  number  of  research  output.  Table  1  presents  the  country  wise  distribution  of  publication  on  Psoriasis.  43.69  %  of  papers  were  brought  out  by  the  authors  whose  address  was  in  uSA.  There  were  22.7  %  papers  published  by  authors  of  uK,  10.4  %  were  published  by  authors  in  Sweden,  5.20  %  of  publication  by  authors  of  Switzerland,  5.05  %  publications  by  authors  of  Australia,  2.26  %  of  publication  by  authors  of  Germany  and  1.4  %  by  authors  of  Malaysia.  There  were  9.31  %  of  papers  published  by  64  more  countries  of the world. It is found that the most of the papers  came  from  the  geographical  locations  where  white  skin population is more prevalence. There are various

For calculation of the Bradford Multiplier, Egghe  has  given  a  mathematical  expression  as:

There are 35 journals which have published papers  ranging 50-100, 56 journals publishes papers ranging  25-49, 17 journals published papers ranging 10-24,  33  journals  published  9  articles  each,  29  journals  published  8  articles  each,  32  journals  published  7  articles each, 55 journals published 6 articles each,  75  journals  published  5  articles  each,  130  journals  
published  4  articles  each,  197  journals  published  3  articles  each,  347  journals  published  2  articles  each,  while  949  journals  published  one  article. 
The  core  journals  in  any  field  of  study  are  chosen based on the subject coverage, and play a  crucial  role  in  selection  of  journals  for  publication  or  research  articles.  The  selection  criterion  of  ranking  of  the  core  journals  usually  made  based  on  the  number  of  citation  received  by  the  articles  published  in  that  journal  during  a  period.  
So, the ranking of the journals publishing Psoriasis  literature is made on the basis of number of papers

published  by  each  journal  in  the  field  (Table  3).  Table 3 presents the overall coverage of the journals  and the number of articles published by them. The  table also presents the data for cumulative number  of  journals,  cumulative  percentage  of  journals,  log  of  cumulative  citations  to  assess  the  distribution  of  Bradford  plot. 
On the basis of the distribution of journals and  corresponding number of articles published by each  journal,  a  three  zone  has  been  framed  as  per  the  Bradford conception.  The distribution of these three  zones  is  given  in  Table  4. 
In  context  of  present  literature  on  Psoriasis,  it  is  found  that  11  journals  constitute  first  zone  have  8159  (33.95  %)  articles,  next  zone  with  74 journals have 7901 (32.88 %) articles and much  larger group of 2054 journals have 7971 (33.17 %)  articles.  Bradford  postulated  the  division  into  three  equal  zones  of  one  third  article  is  each  zone.  
Based  on  the  Bradford  law,  each  zone  should  follow a linear geometric expression in the form of 1  : n : n2. On analysis of the data, it is found that the  literature on Psoriasis does not follow this rule and  each zone represents the Bradford expression as 11  :  74  :  2054  which  does  not  fit  into  the  expression.  The first zone, which is represented as nucleus zone  have  11  journals  and  the  multiplier  value  n=17.27  
50 
(the  mean  value)  is  expressed  as: 
11  :  11  x  17.27  :  11x  (17.27)2   ::  1  :  n  :  n 
2 
11  :  189.97  :  3280.78  >>  3481.75 
    Percentage  error  =  
3481.75− 2143 
  x100=62.47% 
2143 
On the basis of this calculation, it is found that  the  percentage  error  is  very  high,  and  the  data  of  Psoriasis  literature  does  not  fit  the  Bradford  expression. Cline29  stated that if any group of data  which  have  smaller  percentage  error  can  adhere  the  Bradford  law.  Therefore,  to  verify  the  Bradford  law  on  Psoriasis  literature  it  is  decided  to  check  its  compatibility  with  Leimkuhler  model. 
5.3   v erification  of  Bradford  Law  through  
Leimkuhler  Model 
Bradford  law’s  of  scattering  has  been  widely  used to study the distribution of literature throughout  the  globe.  According  to  this  law,  there  are  small  number of journals which produce maximum number  of  literature,constitutes  a  nucleus  of  core  journals.  There is various variant interpretation of Bradford law.  These variant forms were discussed by Leimkuhler.  For  this  study  both  the  model  of  Bradford  as  well  as  Leimkuhler  were  tested  to  justify  the  scattering  of  the  literature  in  Psoriasis.

Based  on  this  calculation  the  tabulation  of  the  data  can  be  arranged  as  given  in  Table  5. 
Table  5  shows  that  number  of  journals  in  the  
p   =  3  (Number  of  zones  in  which  the  data  has  nucleus  is  9  and  the  mean  value  of  Bradford  
to  be  divided) 
y0   = A/p  =  24031/3  =  8010.34  =  8010  (approx.)

       a = y0/logk = 8010/log15 = 8010/1.17609125906 
            =  6810.696  =  6811  (approx.) 
b  = k-1/r0 =  15-1/9  =  15-0.11  =  14.89  =  15

multiplier  is  14.91.  Therefore,  Bradford  distribution  is  written  as: 
9  :  9  x  14.91  :  9  x  (14.91)2   :: 1 : n : n 
2 
i.e.,  9  :  134.19  :  2000.77      >>    2143.962143.96−2143 
Percentage  of  error  =    x  100 
     
2143 
=  0.045  % 
Thus, one can notice that the percentage error  in this case is negligible, and the number of journals  publishing psoriasis literature is increased by 14.91,

the  new  Bradford  multiplier. The  Bradford  constant  was  calculated  from  the  distribution  of  journals  in  3  zones  according  to  Bradford  model  (Table  5).  In  the graphic formulation of Bradford-Zipf plot (Fig. 3)  the  behavior  can  be  seen  of  scientific  publications  going  as  an  ascending  line. 
6.   c oncLuSIonS 
Through  this  study  it  is  found  that  there  were  24031  articles  available  during  the  period  of  study  which  deals  with  different  area  of  psoriasis. These  articles have been published by 2143 journals. As per  theoretical aspects of the Bradford law, there were 11  journals (one third of journals–as per Bradford zone)  should have published maximum number of articles,  does not hold good and shown high percentage error.  After  adopting  the  alternatives  such  as  the  model  proposed by Leimkuhler, it is found that there were  nine journals which constitute the nucleolus zone and  produced  maximum  number  of  articles.  So,  it  can  be concluded that the theoretical aspect of Bradford  law of scattering is supplemented by its alternatives.  On  this  basis,  the  ranked  list  of  most  productive  journal  shows  that, British  Journal  of  Dermatology is  the  most  productive  journal.    This  study  is  an  attempt  to  analyse  the  patterns  of  publication  in  
the  field  of  Psoriasis.  This  study  shall  be  helpful  to  the  library  and  information  science  community  to  choose  right  journal  in  case  of  medical  science  dealing  with  the  disease  like  psoriasis.  This  study  shall  also  be  helpful  to  the  medical  scientists  who  are working in the area of psoriasis or dermatology  who  wish  to  publish  their  research  in  this  area.
