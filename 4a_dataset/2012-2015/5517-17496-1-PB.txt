Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) libraries at Bombay, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras,  and Roorkee have been subscribing to over 15000 e-journals, e-books, databases and other e-resources  either individually or in consortia mode and spending a substantial part of their acquisition budget for over  a decade now. This paper attempts to study the marketing efforts being made by these libraries to improve  the awareness and increase the usage of these resources. Marketing-related data were collected through  a questionnaire, personal visits, and discussions with the librarians, and the usage data were obtained  from publishers.  Data analysis revealed that e-resources in all IITs are being heavily used as the number  of downloads have increased from 32,33,818 to 75,23,371 refecting a growth of 132 % over a period of  9 years. The IIT libraries adopt multipronged approach and use 27 marketing techniques to promote their  resources. The study also showed that there were downward fuctuations in usage in different years. It is  suggested that these libraries shall regularly re-look at the marketing strategies and techniques; study their  impact on the awareness and usage of the e-resources; identify and remove the bottlenecks; and make  additional efforts including interacting with the users to ensure optimum utilisation of these resources.

1. INTRODUcTION 
Marketing  means  different  things  to  different  people.  Many  regard  it  as  promotion  and  selling  of  products,  and  consider  it  as  function  which  is  peculiar  to  business  establishments.  However,  marketing  is  not  limited  to  selling  and  promotion,  it  is  a  continuing  process  and  involves  a  range  of  activities  such  as  identifying  a  target  market,  determining the wants and needs of that market with  empathy and responsiveness, conveying effectively,  doing everything to satisfy those wants and needs,  and  ensuring  at  the  same  time  that  this  is  done  better  and  faster  than  the  competitors  to  achieve  desirable  profit  to  the  organisation  and  to  the  customers.  Marketing  also  has  great  relevance  to  the  problems  and  challenges  faced  by  the  non- profit  organisations  as  it  aims  to  achieve  goals  of  better  services  and  higher  user  satisfaction  rather  than the goals of profit, market share, or return on  investment.  Marketing  for  non-profit  organisations  is  about  service  and  adding  value,  and  to  be  successful1.        
Marketing in non-profit organisations like libraries,  involves activities conducted by people and institutions  to achieve goals other than normal business goals,  though  it  may  use  concepts  and  practices  applied  to business situations. Marketing is about everything  that  a  library  does  or  says.  It  is  concerned  with  development  of  relationships  with  all  stakeholders,

telling  them  about  what  you  are,  and  what  you  do,  and so on. While profitability may be its goal in the  business environment, the improved service coupled  with  increased  efficiency,  measured  by  increasing  use  is  the  main  goal  of  library  marketing.  Library  marketing  is  a  process  in  which  users’  needs  for  information  and  knowledge  are  identified  and  met  through matching these against appropriate information  resources  and  services.  User  satisfaction  is  the  cornerstone  of  marketing  library  services2. 
2.  LITERATURE  REVIEW 
According to the Association of Research Libraries3,  “marketing is the organised process of planning and  executing  the  conception,  pricing,  promotion,  and  distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create  exchanges that will (if applicable) satisfy individual  and  organisational  objectives.  Marketing  collects  and uses demographic, geographic, behavioral and  psychological information. Marketing also fulfills the  organisation’s  mission  and,  like  public  relations,  inspires public awareness and educates”. “Marketing  is  about  products/services  you  are  trying  to  sell,  or  persuade  people  to  use  –  assessing  customer  needs and designing products accordingly.  Libraries  operate a service and have customers – anything to  do  with  promoting  the  library  service  and  reaching  out  to  engage  readers  in  the  community  can  be  described  as  marketing”4.

JOTWANI: MARKETING Of ELECTRONIC  R ESOURCES IN  IIT L IBRARIES 
“The  real  value  of  marketing  is  to  ensure  the  survival and growth of the libraries and information  services,  which  exist  to  enhance  the  communities  they  serve,  adding  value  to  the  lives  of  the  people  and  organisations  who  are  their  users,  customers  and clients”5. Marketing, therefore, enables libraries  to establish relationships with users, fund-providers,  governments,  parental  organisation,  local  groups,  and  have  not  only  to  satisfy  their  needs  but  also  convince them for efforts/resources that are invested  for the benefit of the user community. It also offers  libraries  the  means  to  measure  the  customers’  satisfaction,  respond  to  the  public  scrutiny,  and  educate the stakeholders in new ideas and issues,  developments, and social awareness. finally, marketing  can  ensure  the  survival  and  growth  of  the  libraries  and  information  services.  
3.  MARKETINg  Of  E-REsOURcEs  
E-resources  are  those  digitised  or  born  digital  publications that can be accessed via e-transmission.  These web-based resources are more current than  their  print  counterparts,  are  accessible  to  multiple  concurrent users, support distance education, reach to  remote and under-served areas and have no constraint  of time and space and become invaluable research  tools and complement print-based resources in any  library.  E-resources  provide  access  to  information  that  might  be  restricted  to  the  users  because  of  geographical  location  or  finances. Through  various  search techniques, these resources can be searched,  browsed and interlinked with other publications and  databases, downloaded and saved in different formats  for  future  use.  In  addition,  they  are  convenient  to  use  as  these  can  be  accessed  from  the  library,  internet  café,  offices  or  from  the  comfort  of  the  homes  at  any  time  of  the  day.  One  of  the  biggest  advantages of the e-resources is that they facilitate  formation  of  consortia  where  group(s)  of  libraries  join  together  to  leverage  their  collective  strength  and to acquire large number of information sources  at  a  very  low  price.  Numerous  studies  conducted  mainly  in  academic  environment  and  focused  on  people's  perceptions  and  preferences  have  found  the rapidly growing acceptance of e-resources within  the  scholarly  community6,7. 
There are still a significant number of users who  in  several  studies  in  academic,  public  and  special  library  settings  have  observed  that  they  didn’t  know  that  their  library  or  information  centre  had  a  particular  resource  or  service  and  that  they  would  have used it8. Effective marketing can help libraries  overcome this challenge, reach to all their users and  let  them  know  that  they  have  a  large  collection  of  convenient,  easy-to-use,  high-quality  resources.  (a)  Plan  and  Implementation 
Similar to library marketing, e-resources’ marketing  also require developing a plan based on   the  input  
collected  from  as  many  stakeholders  as  possible.   The  plan  shall  include  setting  out  the  goals  and  objectives,  defining  the  market,  setting  up  the  communication channels and identifying appropriate  marketing  techniques,  and  evaluating  the  plan.  Answers  need  to  be  developed  to  a  number  of  the  fundamental questions that are being planned to be  addressed  in  the  marketing  effort  like  how  to:  (i)  Get  the  attention  of  the  users  
(ii) Enhance  awareness  of  what  is  available  and  
its  value  to  users  
(iii) Improve  the  acceptance  of  the  new  resources  
and  services,  and  
(iv) Help guide users who are prone to search free  
web  content  first,  to  the  appropriate  library  
e-resources.  
Understanding  the  users  is  also  an  important  part  of  developing  a  plan.  It  requires  putting  some  time and efforts to determine what the users think,  want,  and  need.  User  surveys  both  in  person  and  online,  and  interaction  with  focus  groups  can  help  in  this.  Some  universities  also  engage  specialists  to  conduct  a  thorough  study  to  learn  about  their  users  or  how  they  conduct  their  research9.  The  choice of location and medium of communication is  crucial  in  marketing  of  e-resources.  It  is  important  to  flood  the  market  with  the  message.  The  more  places  a  message  can  be  found,  the  more  likely  that  it  is  getting  to  their  users.  Equally  important  is to determine, what makes an effective message?  The message should focus on the convenience and  ease  of  use  rather  than  the  product's  quality  as  users  value  convenience10.    
(b)  Marketing  Techniques 
Marketing plan needs to identify the promotional  techniques  best  suited  to  the  service,  as  well  as  the  needs  and  preferences  of  the  target  audience  in  the  media  they  are  most  likely  to  use.  Not  everyone acquires information in the same manner,  similarly  not  all  users  can  be  reached  with  one  promotional  technique.  A  combination  of  multiple  approaches for delivering the message are advisable  but  the  message  conveyed  by  each  method  needs  to  be  consistent  as  perceived  by  users.  Direct  selling  (Word-of-mouth  or  personal  selling),  print  brochures, posters, giveaways, open house, workshops,  library  catalog,  research  guides/webliographies,  newsletters,  website,  targeted  e-mail,  RSS  feeds,  course  management  systems,  and  advertising  are  some of the techniques commonly used by libraries  to  promote  their  e-resources11  . 
In  a  review  of  24  studies  on  marketing  of  e-resources  published  from  1994-2009,  Kennedy12 found 38 unique marketing techniques in use. She has  grouped  these  techniques  into  four  categories: 
163

DJLIT,  VOL.  34,  NO.  2, MARCH   2014 
(i)  Human interaction (academic staff as collection  
developers, collaboration, collection policy, faculty/ 
professionals as marketing tools, phone call/office  
visit,  students    as    marketing  tools,  surveys,  
word  of  mouth) 
(ii)  E-communication (blackboard, branding, e-mail  
(external and internal), feedback forum, home/ 
office  access,  mascot,  online  social  network,  
screen  saver,  usage  statistics,  webpage  alert,  
customised  webpage)  
(iii) Physical  items  (banners/posters,  bookmarks,  
calendar, flyers/brochures, giveaways, incentives,  
newsletter,  newspaper  alert,  pins,  postcards/ 
letters/direct  mail),  and  
(iv) Training  (fAQs,  native  language  education,  
patron  training  (group  and  individual),  slide  
show/demonstrations,  staff  training  (group  and  
individual),  use  guide.  
  (c)  Evaluation 
Integral to the plan to market e- resources is a  methodology to evaluate its success or failure vis- a-vis the intended objectives. It is very important to  measure  the  outcome  and  identify  what  does  and  doesn't work. Increasing awareness of e-products and  services may be laudable but it does no good either  to the library or to users. What matters is use. Higher  usage  of  a  database,  e-journal,  or  chat  reference  service  is  good  for  both  the  library  and  the  users.   3.1  Marketing  of  E-resources  in  IIT  Libraries 
Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are known  world  over  for  their  ‘Culture  of  Excellence’  and  recognised  among  the  best  institutions  of  higher  learning  in  engineering,  sciences  and  technology.  At  present,  there  are  16  IITs  out  of  which  7  IITs  (Bombay, Delhi, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras, Guwahati,  and  Roorkee)  have  a  well  maintained,  resource  rich,  and  highly  modernised  central  library  offering  a  package  of  services  to  their  users.  The  library  services  in  remaining  9  IITs  which  were  set  up  in  2008  and  2009,  are  still  under  development.  This  study  covers  libraries  at  7  old  IITs  who  have  been  using web-based e-resources since late 1990s and  their  collection  of  e-resources  has  not  only  been  steadily  increasing  but  also  being  accessed  by  a  large  number  of  users13,14.  These  libraries  provide  access  to  over  15,000  e-journals,  e-books  and  databases  in  all  major  disciplines  to  their  users  and  spend  large  sum  of  money  to  acquire  these  resources.  A study conducted recently revealed that  IIT  libraries  at  Bombay,  Delhi,  Madras,  Kharagpur  and  Roorkee  spend    about  2/3  of  their  annual  budget  to  subscribe  to  e-journals  and  databases.  IIT  Guwahati    spends  about  49  %  of  its    budget  for  this  purpose15.

4.  ObJEcTIVEs 
E-resources have become integral part of the core  collection of IIT libraries, they therefore, must adopt  appropriate marketing strategies to inform, educate,  entertain, help, assess, and monitor regularly so that  the  resources  are  optimally  used  by  all  segments  of the user community in their academic, research,  and  outreach  activities.  The  aim  of  the  study  is  to  seek  answer  to  the  following  queries: 
• Whether IIT libraries adopt a systematic marketing  
approach  to  promote  e-resources? 
• W h a t   a r e   t h e   g o a l s   o f   m a r k e t i n g  
e-resources? 
• Do they work out a marketing plan and implement  
it? 
• Do they have staff trained in marketing for this  
purpose? 
• Is  there  a  budget  allocation  for  marketing  
activities? 
• Do  they  get  management  support? 
• What  are  various  marketing  techniques  used  
by  them  and  their  advantages/disadvantages? • Have they undertaken any study to find out whether  
the  marketing  activities  have  helped  improve  
the  awareness  and  usage  of  e-resources? • Are  they  satisfied  with  the  marketing  activities  
being  undertaken  by  them?  
• Analyse    what  is  the  relationship  between  
marketing  and  the  usage  of  e-resources. 
5.    sc OPE AND  METHODOLOgY 
The study covers  7  IIT Libraries at Kharagpur,  Bombay,  Madras,  Delhi,  Kanpur,  Guwahati,  and  Roorkee. The data related to this study were collected  during  personal  visits,  interviews,  and  using  a  questionnaire.  Websites  and  annual  reports  of  the  MHRD, IITs and INDEST-AICTE consortium were also  scanned to supplement the above information. The  publisher-supplied,  Counter-compliant  (an  industry  standard  for  usage  statistics)  data  was  analysed  to  assess  the  usage  of  these  resources. 
6.  REsULTs  AND ANALY sIs 
The  data  analysis  revealed  the  following  aspects: 
6.1   g oal  of  Marketing  E-resources 
The main goal for IITs to market e-resources is  to  improve  the  utilisation  of  e-resources  by  all  the  users– students, faculty, staff and others, and to enable  them to improve the quality of their  academic and  research output which not only benefits the institutes  where  they  work  but  to  the  country  at  large.

6.2   s taff  Training  & budget Allocation 
One  of  the  remarkable  findings  that  emerged  from  the  survey  was  that  whenever  asked  for,  they  do  get  the  management  support  in  the  form  of  logistics,  additional  infrastructure  or  equipment,  for  producing  publicity  material  like  pamphlets,  brochures, banners, etc., and for organising training  programmes  both  for  staff  and  users.    
None  of  the  libraries  have  had  separate  staff,  or  specific  budget  allocation  for  this  purpose.  The  library  personnel  (generally  the  librarian  or  his/ her  senior  colleagues)  undertake  the  marketing  activities  out  of  their  personal  interest,  enthusiasm  and  commitment  to  better  services  to  the  users.  6.3 Marketing  Plan 
The IIT libraries have not developed a well documented  formal marketing plan, nor they work out any marketing  schedule. They however, follow a marketing strategy  suitable  to  their  institutional  requirements.

6.4 Impact Assessment 
They  have  also  not  undertaken  any  study  to  assess the impact of marketing activities on improving  the awareness and usage of e-resources. However,  they  expressed  the  need  for  more  aggressive  and  planned  marketing  to  promote  e-resources  which  could  further  improve  the  usage  of  e-resources.    6.5 Approach  to  Promote  E-resources 
The  survey  also  revealed  that  IIT  libraries  use  27 out of 33 techniques listed in the questionnaire,  to promote their e-resources. Table 1 shows the data  regarding marketing techniques used by IIT libraries.  It  is  evident  from  Table  1  that  IIT  libraries  follow  multi-pronged approach and use several techniques  simultaneously to promote their e-resources. Some  of  the  important  techniques  are:

have a high visual impact on users, are interactive,  and can provide direct links to e-resources like new  databases announcements, top used lists, subject- specific  lists,  and  creating  a  library  blog  where  users  can  interact  with  the  library.  In  a  study  it  was  found  that  85.71  %  of  the  IIT  library  portals  provide  links  to  access  e-resources  subscribed  by  them,  while  57.14  %  provide  links  to  back  files  of  e-journals, 42.86 % provide links to e-books and only  one  portal  (14.28  %)  provides  access  to  electronic  theses and dissertations17. These libraries also make  announcements  of  newly  acquired  resources,  trial  access,  etc.  through  their  website. 
(b)  List  Services  (Serves)  and  E-mail 
These list services aim to broadcast a message  to  a  large  number  of  people  within  the  Institute  or  beyond  the  boundaries  of  the  institute.    
(c)  News  Groups 
The IIT Bombay has several news groups which  can be subscribed to by users depending upon their  area  of  work  and  interest.  The  Central  Library  has  created a news group where information about latest  happenings  as  well  as  new  services  and  sources  is  posted  for  wider  dissemination.  It  also  allows  subscribers (users) to post their suggestions/feedback.   (d)  Workshops,  Seminars,  etc. 
IIT  libraries  regularly  organise  programmes  to  encourage  and  promote  usage  of  e-resources  as  given  below: 
•  Workshop  on  Optimal  Use  of  E-resources,  IIT  
Bombay,  May  2004. 
• Workshop on ICT for Information Management,  
May  2005. 
• Workshop  on  E-resource  and  IPR  Issues,  IIT

• National  Workshop  on  LIS  Education  in  Digital  
Era,  June  2007. 
• National Workshop on E-resources Management

Zone  User  Convention,  IIT  Roorkee,  18-19  
November  2010. 
• INDEST-AICTE  Workshop  and  Annual  Meets  
Organised  Every  Year  at  Different  Locations. • Workshop on Meeting Users Expectations, May  
2013,  IIT  Bombay. 
(e)  Vendors'  Participation 
One  of  the  important  methods  of  marketing  e-resources  in  IITs  is  through  active  involvement  of  the  publishers  and  vendors.  It  is  different  from  vendors  selling  their  products.  They  regularly  visit  the  IITs  to  interact  with  library  staff  and  the  users  to  update  them  with  new  developments  and/or  
166 
features  added  to  their  product.  Publishers  or  their  representatives  are  invited  to  give  a  detailed  presentation about that resource followed by a live  demonstration.    
(f)  Library  Brochure/Hand  Outs 
Brochures,  hand  outs  are  another  way  to  get  the  word  out.  Some  of  the  printed  materials  used  by  IITs  for  marketing  are  posters,  banners,  charts  and  displays.  IIT  Bombay  library  has  produced  a  colourful  brochure  which  gives  a  complete  list  of  e-resources  along  with  their  URLs.  INDEST-AICTE  Consortium,  IIT  Kharagpur  and  Roorkee  have  also  published and distributed a number of displays and  brochures  to  promote  e-resources.    
(g)  Institute  Newsletter 
The IIT Bombay brings out a monthly newsletter  called Raintree  which publishes all the new activities  and  programmes  of  the  Institute.  Central  library  regularly uses this medium to publicise information  about  e-resources  and  services.  Library  Annual  Report  also  lists  the  e-resources  subscribed  to  by  the  Institute.  IIT  Delhi  library  also  brings  out  newsletter  for  this  purpose. 
(h)  Users  Training 
IIT libraries frequently organise training programs  for  different  categories  of  users  to  train  them  to  be efficient users of e-resources called 'Enhancing  Users  Awareness’  conducted  either  by  the  library  staff or by the representatives of publishers/vendors.  It  generally  includes  an  audio-visual  presentation  and  live  demonstration.      
(i)  One-on-One Appointments 
It is an excellent way to get to know the library  users personally and to understand their information  needs  better.  It  also  gives  user  an  opportunity  to  informally interact various e-resources and other services  of  the  library  resulting  in  the  enhanced  usage. (j)  Relationship  Marketing 
The  emphasis  in  relationship  marketing  is  on  close and frequent customer contact, and on providing  value  to  the  customer  over  the  long-term,  rather  than  in  just  making  one-time  sales,  or  meeting  an  immediate short-term need. This is nothing new for  the  library  as  good  user  service  is  at  the  core  of  our  profession.  Cultivating  and  maintaining  good  relations  is  directly  related  to  users’  satisfaction  and  will  ensure  their  loyalty  which  is  paramount  to  marketing18. Loyal users tell others about good services  and  resources-promotion  by  word  of  mouth. (k)  Word-of-mouth  Marketing 
It is more credible than other marketing techniques  because  only  14  %  of  people  believe  what  they  see,  read  or  hear  in  advertising19.  Surprisingly,  

========5========

JOTWANI: MARKETING Of ELECTRONIC  R ESOURCES IN  IIT L IBRARIES 
90  %  of  the  folks  will  believe  their  family,  friends,  or  colleagues  who  endorse  a  service  or  product  because they know they do not have a vested interest  in  it20.  Library  staff  and  key  faculty  members  or  community leaders can be utilised as proponents of  the library’s services. IIT Bombay, Guwahati, Madras  and Roorkee get trusted advisors to use their services  and  then  inform  others  about  them.  It  saves  time  of  the  users  as  they  need  not  to  sift  through  all  the clutter and using the benefit of someone else’s  experiences  through  word-of-mouth  marketing.      (l)  Marketing  through  Web  2.0 
The  application  of  Web  2.0  techniques  require  no major financial resources to implement21.  Central  library, IIT Bombay has put a video22   on  You  Tube   that demonstrates a creative way to let students know  about  the  library’s  resources  and  services.  It  also  has  RSS  feed  –  enabling  the  users  to  subscribe.  It  has  also  created  its  blog23   to  communicate  and  interact  with  its  users.  Their  users  can  also  follow  them  on  twitter24.                                        
(m)  Branding 
All libraries have their own brands, whether they  have been explicitly developed or present implicitly  in the way library users perceive their services. The  library  website,  where  patrons  are  most  likely  to  access these resources, shall be branded with logo  on  every  page.  Beyond  the  library’s  website,  be  sure  that  the  e-resources  in  the  library’s  collection  are  branded  with  library  name  even  if  one  does  not  control  the  interface.  Librarian  can  often  work  with  a  vendor  or  database’s  marketing  department  to  make  sure  that  his/her  library  name  or  logo  is  displayed  prominently  on  their  interface.  All  IITs  libraries with the exception of Guwahati and Kanpur  use  this  technique.          
6.6  Usage  Evaluation 
Since  higher  usage  of  a  database,  e-journal,  or  e-book    is  a  good  indication  of  the  success  of  marketing campaign, usage data25  in respect of the

that inadequate marketing activities have affected  the usage which declined during 2009-2012. IIT  Kanpur's  total  usage  of  e-resources  in  2012  as  well  as  during  2004-12  is  lower  than  IIT  Bombay,  Kharagapur,  Delhi  and  Madras.  The usages at IIT Madras, Kharagpur, Guwahati,  and Roorkee who use 16-17 marketing techniques  to promote their e-resources have been on the  upswing  with  minor  fluctuations  during  some  years.  
IIT  Bombay  uses  highest  number  (24  of  33)  of  marketing  techniques  seems  to  have  been  successful and its usage of e-resources has regularly  increased  from  2007-11.  However  its  usage  in  2012 has marginally decreased. IIT Bombay library  should  adopt    more  innovative  ways  to  market  its  e-resources  to  achieve  higher  usage.    IIT libraries must examine on case to case basis  all  e-resources  particularly  those  with  large  subscription costs and have been showing poor  usage  over  several  years  for  their  continuity  in  future  after  obtaining  the  feedback  from  users.    
7.    c ONcLUsIONs  AND  sUggEsTIONs 
The IIT libraries have been marketing e-resources  among their users for enhancing the awareness and  usage within the constraints of available resources.  However, IIT libraries have to put more sustained efforts  to  further  improve  the  usage  of  e-resources:      • Marketing  in  IIT  libraries  shall  be  made  an  
essential  and  integral  component  of  library  
functioning, and all activities covering promotion,  
marketing, publicity, public relations, advocacy,  
outreach  programmes,  corporate  and  media  
relations shall be brought under it. This will enable  
these  libraries  to  have  a  comprehensive,  well  
formulated  and  periodically  updated  marketing  
plan incorporating both conventional and modern  
techniques  to  promote  their  resources  and  
services  including  e-resources.    
168 
• 
• 
• 
A  senior  professional  with  qualifications  in  marketing or who has been trained in marketing  shall  be  given  the  responsibility  and  support  for  the  services.    
Adequate funds shall be provided for this purpose  to enable producing required publicity material or  organising activities like training, seminars etc. These  libraries  shall  regularly  re-look  at  the  marketing strategies and techniques, their impact  on the awareness and usage of the e-resources,  identify and remove the bottlenecks, and adopt  innovative methods including enhanced interaction  with  the  users  to  promote  these  resources.    While  marketing  alone  may  or  may  not  be  responsible for increase or decrease in usage,  and there could be several other factors affecting  the usage of e-resources in IITs, the marketing  does  and  can  help  in  improving  the  usage  if  properly  planned  and  executed.  IIT  librarians  should continue to research and innovate their  strategies  to  achieve  the  objectives.
