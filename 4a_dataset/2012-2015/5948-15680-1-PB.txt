This paper analyses 605 papers published in the Journal of Intellectual Property Rights  during 1996- 2012, which indicates that the infow of papers has increased during the period of study. The increasing  infow of articles show the popularity of journal among the scientifc community as well as policy makers.  The study shows that number of references per paper is increasing and the average reference per paper  is 23. The proportion of single authored papers is decreasing, while the share of multi-authored papers  is on the rise. About one-fourth of the papers published in the journal are from abroad and the rest from  India. Among  foreign  countries  US  is  the  largest  contributor. Among  the  performing  sectors,  academic  institutions  are  the  largest  contributors  to  the  journal  followed  by  research  institutions. As  an  agency,  CSIR has contributed the highest number of papers and several of the prolifc institutions and authors  
are also from CSIR.

1. IntroductIon 
Before the dawn of 20 
th 
 century, the knowledge  or  the  innovation  created  by  men  fell  within  the  public  domain  and  anybody  could  use  them  for  their  benefit.  However,  as  the  time  passed,  the  importance  of  these  creations  was  realised  and  the commercial aspect started playing an important  role. By the end of 20th  century, things created and  invented by the human mind were recognised as the  intellectual property of the owner. The owner’s right  over these properties was accepted and named as  Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). A new set of laws  called IPR laws were enacted to provide protection  to  the  owners  under  different  names  like  patents,  designs,  copyrights,  and  trademarks,  etc.  The  IPR  were  essentially  recognised  and  accepted  all  over  the  world.  Some  of  the  reasons1   for  accepting  these  rights  are: 
(a)  Providing incentives and due recognition to the 
inventors; 
(b)  Ensuring material reward for intellectual property; 
        and  
(c)  Ensuring  the  availability  of  the  genuine  and 
        original  products. 
Several  agencies  of  the  Government  of  India  like Department of Science and Technology (DST),  Department  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  
(DSIR), and the (CSIR) organised several programmes  to  educate  scientists  and  policy  makers  about  the  importance  of  IPR  and  their  protection.  To  boost  it  further,  the  then  Director  General  of  CSIR,  Dr  R.A.  Mashelkar  suggested  to  launch  a  journal  on  the  issues  of  IPRs  and  thus  originated Journal  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  (JIPR).

National  Institute  of  Science  Communication  and  Information  Resources  (NISCAIR),  New  Delhi  is  the  nodal  agency  for  publishing  the  science  and  technology  journals  for  CSIR.  Keeping  this  in  view,  NISCAIR  was  assigned  the  task  of  bringing  out  the    Journal  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  (JIPR)   in  1996.  It  is  a  peer  reviewed,  bi-monthly  publication  and  is  the  first  journal  on  the  subject  of  IPR  from  India.  The  objective  of  the  journal  is  two-fold:  (a)  to  enhance  communication  between  policy  makers,  organisational  agents,  academics,  and  managers  on  the  critical  understanding  and  research on intellectual property; and (b) to promote  the  development  of  the  newly  cultivated  research  field.The  journal  publishes  contributed  and  invited  articles, case studies and patent reviews; technical  notes on current IPR issues; literature review; world  literature  on  IPR;  national  and  international  IPR  news,  book  reviews,  and  conference  reports.

present  the  journal  is  abstracted  and  indexed  by  Scopus,  EBSCOhost  Electronic  Journals  Services  (EJS),  Directory  of  Open  Access  Journal  (DOAJ),  Library and Information Science Abstracts Database  (LISA)  and  Legal  Information  Institute  of  India  (LIIofIndia)  databases.  National  Bureau  of  Plant  Genetic  Resources  (NBPGR,  New  Delhi)  have  included  14  articles  from  various  issues  of  the  journal  as  the  study  material  for  its  course  PGS- 503 on intellectual property and its management in  agriculture.  Jawaharlal  Nehru  University's  m   Phil/ PhD's  foundation  course  on  IPR  also  has  included  some articles from the Journal as essential reading  material.  The  Journal  was  included  in  the  Science  Citation  Index-Expanded  (SCIE)  in  the  year  2010  and the impact factor of journal as per the Journal  Citation  Reports  2011  is  0.343.      
3. lIterAture revIew 
Individual  journals  have  been  the  focus  of  several bibliometric studies in the past decade. For  instance Narang2 analysed 8396 citations appended  to 737 articles published in Indian  Journal  of  Pure  and  applied  Mathematics   published  during  1998- 2002 and found that contributions are increasing in  successive  volumes,  journal  articles  are  the  most  cited  and  Delhi  University  was  the  top  contributors  during the period of study. Jena3  made a bibliometric  study  of  8114  citations  appended  to  507  articles  published  in  Indian  Journal  of  Fibre  and  Textile  Research   published  during  1996-2004  found  that  rate  of  receipt  and  acceptance  is  six  months  and  acceptance  and  publication  is  11  months.  Citation  pattern of Indian Journal of Environmental Protection for  articles  published  in  1994,  1999  and  2004  was  studied  by  Biradar4   and  the  study  indicates  that  team  research  was  preferred  as  compared  to  solo  research. Articles published in Journal of the Indian  Society for Cotton Improvements were analysed by  Dixit  and  Katare5.  Authors  found  that  450  journals  were  cited  in  327  articles  published  during  1995- 2004. Of these 74 % were journals originated from  abroad.  Articles  published  in  Pramana:  A  Journal  of Physics  during 1982-2006 was made by Kumar 
6,  et  al.  Authors  found  that  the  number  of  articles  being published in the journal is increasing, but the  impact  factor  of  the  journal  is  constant.  Garg7,  et  al. developed  a  scientometric  profile  of  the  journal  Mausam based on 369 items published in it during  2003-2006 and found that impact factor of the journal  for 2005 and 2006 was higher than several journals  being  included  from  India  in  Web  of  Science  and  recommended  its  inclusion  in  it.  Kumar  &  Kumar8 examined 8093 citations given in the Journal of oil  Seed  Research  during  the  period  1993-2004  and  found  that  50%  citations  were  contributed  by  20  
periodicals. Kulkarni9, et al. examined citations in  Indian  Journal of Pharmaceutical Education and Research for  a  period  of  1996-2006  and  like  other  studies  it  was  found  that  journals  are  the  prominent  source  of citations. Kumar & moorthy10  analysed  DESIDoC  Journal  of library  and  Information  Technology for  2001-2010  and  found  that  the  number  of  papers  published by the journal has increased substantially  and the average length of papers was 6-10 pages.  Papers from single authors formed the major chunk  of total papers published and government research  institutes and universities were the main contributors.  The present study makes a bibliometric analysis of  the Journal of Intellectual Property Rights since its  publication  in  1996  to  2012  and  is  an  extension  of  the  study  undertaken  by  Swain  &  Panda11   for  2002-2010.  
4. oBjectIveS 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
• Examine  the  number  of  contributions  and  the  
references  cited  during  1996-2012; 
• Examine  pattern  of  authorship  and  how  it  has  
changed  over  a  period  of  time; 
• Examine  the  geographical  distribution  of  
articles; 
• Identify the most prolific institutions and prolific  
authors; 
• Examine  average  length  of  articles  in  terms  of  
pages;  and 
• Examine  the  citations  earned  by  the  articles  
published  from  2002  onwards. 
The study is based on the contributions listed under the  article  section  of  the  issues  of  the  source  journal. 
5.   dA tA And  Methodology 
The  source  journal  is  an  open  access  journal  and is available on the CSIR-NISCAIR website12. The  data  for  the  study  was  downloaded  from  the  said  website for 17 years from volume 1(1996) to volume  17(2012).  The  data  consists  of  year  of  publication  with  its  volume  number,  name  of  the  author  with  their  affiliations  and  its  geographical  location,  total  count  of  authors,  length  of  the  articles  in  terms  of  the number of pages, number of references cited by  the article. The data was downloaded on mS Excel  sheets.  Citations  earned  by  the  articles  from  2002  onwards were examined from google Scholar, and  recorded on the same Excel sheet.  Data was analysed  to meet the objectives mentioned above. Complete  count method has been followed for the analysis of  the data. Under this method, each country or state  or  institution  or  authors  in  multi-authored  papers  are given unit credit for their contributions and thus  the number of contributions is more than the actual

contributions.  In  the  present  case  also,  the  actual  number  of  papers  published  was  605  which  have  increased  to  847  using  complete  count  method.  
6.   r eSultS And  dIScuSSIonS 
The  results  of  various  parameters  listed  under  the  objectives  are: 
6.1   d istribution  of  output  and  references  
Since its launch in 1996, the journal is appearing  on schedule regularly. Table 1 presents the data on  the number of articles, and the references received  
by  each  volume  during  1996-2012. 
6.1.1  Distribution  of Articles 
During the period of study the journal published  605  articles  in  102  issues  in  17  volumes.  Thus,  on  an  average  the  journal  published  about  36  articles in each volume, which means approximately  6  articles  per  issue.  Data  presented  in  Table  1  indicates  that  till  2004  the  journal  published  less  than  average  number  of  articles.  However,  the  number  of  articles  published  2005  onwards  have  increased consistantly (Fig. 1). The highest number  of articles (56) were published in Volume 17 (2012)  closely followed by the number of articles in volume  16  (2011).  The  pattern  of  publication  of  papers  during  1996-2013  in  blocks  of  two  years  is  also  shown.  It  indicates  that  except  a  dip  in  the  third  block  (2000-2001)  there  is  a  constant  increase  in  
Figure 1. Pattern of infow of papers (%) during 1996-July 
 2013. 
the  number  of  papers  published  by  the  journal.  It  implies  that  the  journal  is  getting  popular  among  the  community  of  scientists,  technologists,  and  policy  makers.  This  is  also  reflected  by  5  special  issues  published  by  the  journal  during  2005-2012.  These issues dealt with technology transfer with IPR  (September 2005), patents and emerging technologies  (January 2007), TRIPS and pharmaceutical industry  (September 2008), IPR and agriculture (march 2011)  and  leveraging  IPR  for  business  advantage  and  (September 2012). These issues were included 15,  17,  17,  18,  and  16  articles  respectively.

6.1.2  Distribution  of  References 
References are an important part of any publication.  These  provide  the  reader  with  the  background  information  about  the  topic  being  discussed  in  the  paper.  At  the  same  time  these  assure  the  reader  that  the  author(s)  are  familiar  with  the  history  of  the  topic  being  investigated  and  reported.  Table  1  also  provides  data  on  the  number  of  references  cited  in  each  volume.  It  reveals  that  the  number  of  references  per  paper  is  increasing  over  the  period  of  time.  However,  the  pattern  of  references  is  chaotic.  The  average  number  of  references  were  about  23.  Analysis  of  data  indicates  that  before  2003,  the  number  of  references  per  paper  is  less  than  the  average,  but  after  that  these  have  increased. Among all the years the highest number  of  references  per  paper  is  for  volume  12  (2007)  and  the  lowest  number  of  references  per  paper  is  in  volume  3  (1998).  The  number  of  references  is  low  in  the  beginning  because  the  journal  had  just  started  and  the  field  of  IPR  was  nascent  to  India.  These  have  increased  over  the  period  of  time  as  the  awareness  of  IPR  is  growing  with  time.      6.1.3 Authorship  Pattern  of  Contributors 
Earlier, authors used to publish articles independently  but  now  most  of  the  research  work  being  carried  out  is  in  collaboration  and  one  or  more  number  of  authors  together  publish  an  article.  Statistical  data indicate that percentage of research produced  by  teamwork  has  been  growing  steadily  for  more  than  half  a  century13.  Study  of  authorship  pattern  deals  with  the  kind  of  authors  and  the  nature  of  collaboration  among  them  and  collaborative  trends  of authors. The extent of collaboration depends on  the  number  of  participants  involved  in  the  work.  Collaboration is high in the field of science, technology  and  medicine  than  that  of  social  sciences  and  humanities.  Collaboration  is  observed  the  least  in  the field of humanities. Table 2 provides the details  about  the  authorship  pattern  among  the  articles  in  the  source  journal  for  the  period  1996-2012  in  two  blocks. Data presented in Table 2 indicates highest  number  (67.8  %)  of  articles  have  been  contributed  by single authors and the rest by two or more than  two  authors  respectively. This  indicates  that  like  in  other  discipline  of  social  sciences  here  also  single  authored  papers  dominate.  Authors  calculated  the  values  of  co-authorship14   (CAI)  for  two  blocks  of  
table 2. Authorship pattern of contributions 
output  to  study  how  the  pattern  of  authorship  has  changed  during  2005-2012  as  compared  to  1996- 2004.  The  value  of  CAI  given  in  Table  2  indicates  that the proportion of two and more than two authors  have  increased  in  the  second  block  as  compared  to  the  first  block.  The  change  of  the  pattern  of  authorship during 1996-2012 is depicted in Fig. 2. It  also  indicates  that  the  proportion  of  single  authors  have  decreased  from  over  90  %  to  about  60  %  in  the  later  period,  while  the  proportion  of  two  and  multi-authored  papers  have  increased.

2012. 
6.1.4 geographical  Distribution  of  Contributions 
Anonymous  articles  or  articles  for  which  the  author location is not mentioned have been included  in the category of others. Table 3 presents the data  on  the  geographical  distribution  of  the  published  papers.  Based  on  the  complete  count  of  articles  it  is  observed  that  847  articles  were  contributed  by  Indian  authors  and  authors  from  abroad.  Of  these,  Indian authors contributed 71 % of the articles and  the  rest  29  %  were  contributed  by  authors  from  abroad.  Contributions  from  abroad  were  from  38  countries. Of these, the USA contributed the highest  number  of  papers  followed  by  UK,  China,  South  Korea  and  Switzerland.  Sixteen  countries,  whose  name  has  not  been  listed  in  the  table  contributed  one  paper  each.

Figure  3  presents  the  graphical  distribution  of  output  according  to  different  states.  The  graph  indicates that among all the states, Delhi published  the  highest  number  (31.2  %)  of  papers  followed  by  West  Bengal,  Karnataka,  and  Andhra  Pradesh.  Himachal  Pradesh  contributed  the  least  number  of  papers. One possible reason for more papers from  Delhi  may  be  the  concentration  of  academic  and  R&D  institutions  in  it.    
6.1.6  Most  Prolific  Institutions 
Total output excluding anonymous and individual  papers  came  from  272  institutions  located  in  India  and abroad. These institutions were scatted among  academic  institutions  (universities  and  colleges),  R&D institutions, law institutions/universities, private  
Figure  3. geographical  distribution  of  contributions  by 
 states 
legal firms and others which could not be classified  among these. Like distribution of scientific output15,  here also the share of academic institutions was the  highest (204) followed by research institutions (185),  legal educational institutions (164), and private legal  firms (76). The remaining 218 papers were scattered  among others (130), individuals (62) and anonymous  (26).  Several  of  these  institutions  contributed  only  one  paper  each,  while  some  others  contributed  between  2-9  papers.  Details  of  their  contributions  along with the names of prolific institutions are given  in  (Table  4).  However,  the  output  is  concentrated  among 14 institutions which contributed 10 or more  papers and their contribution is more than one-fourth  (27.3 %) of the total output. Of the prolific institutions  seven  were  law  educational  institutions  and  five  were  R&D  institutions,  of  which  four  belonged  to  CSIR.  Also,  the  share  of  CSIR  and  its  constituent  R&D institutions was the highest. Their share in the  total output excluding institutions not listed in Table  4  is  74  publications.  However,  the  total  share  of  CSIR  and  its  constituent  units  is  94  publications.  One  possible  reason  for  this  may  be  that  CSIR  is  the  agency  that  files  maximum  number  of  patents  from India and the scientists of CSIR are well aware  of  the  IPR  laws. 
6.1.7  Most  Prolific Authors 
The total output was contributed by 616 authors  from  India  and  abroad.  Among  the  contributing  authors  93  were  women  authors,  which  is  quite  a  significant number as the women authors constitute  about  15  %  of  the  total  authors.  Table  5  presents  the data on the contribution of prolific authors. The  nine prolific authors contributed 114 paper and the  rest  733  papers  were  contributed  by  607  authors.  Authors  also  examined  the  citations  of  the  prolific  authors during 2002-2012 using google Scholar. It  was found that among all the authors V.K. Gupta of  CSIR-NISATADS  received  the  highest  citations.  6.1.8 length  of Articles 
Journals  often  mention  about  the  number  of  words in the instruction to authors and the author(s)  is  supposed  to  keep  the  article  length  within  that  limit.  Accordingly  the  length  of  articles  submitted  to  the  journal  under  study  varied  from  5000-7000  words.  An  analysis  was  made  of  the  length  of  articles  in  terms  of  page  numbers  as  word  counts  were  not  available.  For  this  the  page  lengths  have  been  divided  into  three  categories  i.e.  1-5,  6-10  and more than 10. Data for the same in two blocks  (volume  1-9  and  volume  10-17)  is  presented  in  Table  6.  The  data  has  been  divided  into  two  parts  to  examine  how  the  proportion  of  page  numbers  has  changed  in  two  blocks.  An  analysis  of  data

indicates  that  of  the  605  articles  published  in  the  journal  during  1996-2012  it  is  observed  that  more  than  half  (52  %)  of  the  contributions  were  in  the  category  of  page  length  6-10  pages  followed  by page  lengths  of  more  than  10  pages.  Page  length  of 1-5 pages was the minimum. Further analysis of  data  indicates  that  6-10  page  share  has  increased  in  the  second  block  while  of  other  two  categories  have  declined  in  the  later  block.

Citation  analysis  is  the  major  thrust  area  of  bibliometric  research.  It  deals  with  the  analysis  of  the  bibliographic  references  which  generally  appear  at  the  end  of  the  scientific  communication.   Citation  analysis  measures  the  impact  of  each  article  by  counting  the  number  of  times  they  were  cited  by  other  articles.  High  levels  of  citations  to  a  scientific  publication  have  been  interpreted  as  signs of scientific influence, impact, and visibility. An  author’s  visibility  can  be  measured  by  determining  how  often  these  publications  have  been  cited  in  other  authors’  publications.  In  the  present  case  the citations were examined using google Scholar.  Citations  were  available  in  google  Scholar   from  Volume 7(2) onwards. Table 7 provides the data on  the  pattern  of  citations  for  different  volumes.  The

data presented in Table 7 indicates that the articles  published  in  volumes  7  and10  of  the  journal  have  the  highest  average  citation.  Volumes  16  and  17  have  low  average  citations  because  of  the  smaller  citation  window  for  these.

The  Journal  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights 
began  as  a  bimonthly  publication  in  1996  and  its popularity among the scientists, technologists  and policy makers has increased as witnessed  by the number of papers published over the past  17  years.  The  average  number  of  references  per  article  is  about  23  and  the  number  of  references  per  article  has  increased  over  the  period  of  time.  
Pattern  of  authorship  of  papers  indicates  that  the  highest  contributions  are  single  authored.  However,  the  share  of  single  authored  papers  has  declined  with  time    and  the  two  or  multi- authored  papers  has  increased. 
As reflected by the geographical distribution of  articles it appears that the journal is international  in scope as about 29 % articles are from abroad  excluding anonymous articles. Among the Indian  contributions,  it  is  seen  that  the  authors  from  Delhi  alone  have  contributed  approximately  32  %  of  total  Indian  contributions  which  is  the  highest  among  Indian  contributions.    The  high  percentage  may  be  owing  to  the  fact  that  the  journal is published form Delhi by CSIR-NISCAIR.  It  also  indicates  that  Delhi  is  a  strong  hub  for  IPR  studies. 
Among  the  foreign  contributions,  the  United  States  of  America  is  the  highest  contributor  and  about  4.25  %  of  total  contributions  to  the  journal  which  is  about  17  %  of  total  foreign  contributions.  The reason may be high degree  of  awareness  among  the  US  policy  makers  about  the  IPR. 
Most of the prolific institutions are law universities/ institutions.  However,  CSIR  and  one  of  its  institutions  are  among  the  three  top  ranking  institutions.  Similarly,  about  half  of  the  output  of  the  prolific  authors  is  by  CSIR  scientists.  Also among the prolific authors CSIR-NISTADS  author  was  the  top  cited  author. 
More  than  half  of  the  articles  have  a  page  length  of  6-10  pages.    Thus,  the  most  of  the  articles are medium sized which is liked by the  majority  of  the  reader.    It  indicates  that  the  care  is  taken  to  hold  the  reader’s  attention.
