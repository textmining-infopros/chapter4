Major aim of any university library is to support teaching, learning and research activities of its parent  institutions, university library must therefore make sure that their resources are fne use of by its users.  The  study  has  been  conducted  to  know  the  available  information  sources  in  the  Karnataka  university  library and its usage pattern among the research scholars in different faculties in several Departments  of the University. The study shows that how the usage of the information resources changing from print  to e-resources and more users are eager to use electronic resources. For this study hypothesis was set  and various statistical methods like chi-square test, etc., were used. 
Keywords: Library resources, library services, use of resources, user study, information retrieval 
1.  INtRODUCtION 
The  major  aim  of  any  university  library  is  to  support  teaching,  learning  and  research  activities.  University  library  must  therefore  make  sure  that  their resources are well utilised as this is essential  for Educational development. Therefore, information  is  acquired,  processed,  and  disseminated  through  the  university  library  in  educational  setting.  Many  studies have been carried out on availability of library  resource and utilisation of existing resource. Among  those  studies  many  of  them  find  out  scarcity  of  resources for usage1-2  and obsolescence of existing  resources. For the library personnel, it is necessary  to  understand,  how  to  use  resources,  changing  needs  of  users  and  their  levels  of  satisfaction.  The  university  libraries  therefore,  provide  relevant  resources  and  services  to  its  users  like  students,  researchers and faculties. The libraries have different  functions  like,  borrowing  books,  current  services  and retrospective search, current contents, research  journals,  research  reports,  bibliographical  tools,  reference  material,  information  consolidation  and  repackaging services and products for its clientele3.  Even  university  libraries  are  implicit  e-resources  replaces the physical material4. The current study also  carried out to find out the usage pattern of existing  library  resources  and  services.  The  study  looks  at  the  use  of  library  resources  by  research  scholars  in  various  faculties  at  Karnatak  University. 
2.  LItERAtURE REvIEW 
Numbers of studies have been conducted on the  use of information resources by research scholars.  A  study  by  Awana5   reveals  that  the  academic  libraries more often do not have current and relevant  information,  due  to  this  academic  libraries  fail  to  attract  more  users  towards  libraries.  In  an  another  study by Siddique6  on the uses of library collection  in  Jawaharlal  Nehru  University  library,  found  that  69  %  visit  the  library  daily  and  31  %  of  them  found  the  library  collection  adequate  to  meet  their  information  needs.  
Kawatra7 in  his  study  found  the  attitudes  of  research  scholars  towards  use  of  resources  and  services  in  three  universities  of  Rajasthan,  it  was  obsereved that scholars at all the three universities  are  not  adequately  involved  in  using  the  sources.  Another study by Jamil, T. & Jamil8   found  out  that,  besides  using  the  available  library  material  users  find  lack  of  library  services  and  skilled  staff  for  retrieval  of  the  required  information.  However,  the  faculties  are  well  aware  about  the  use  of  library  resources  and  services  also  well  versed  in  library  classification and cataloging for locating the library  resources  as  studied  by  Lahor  &  Kumbar9.  
Ologbonsaiye10 found that the  index  for  scaling  patrons satisfaction include the quality of a library’s  collections,  services  and  availability  of  materials  for  use  in  the  types  and  accessibility  to  users.

The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to:  
Examine  how  often  and  what  purpose  scholars  use  the  library; 
Find  the  information  resources  and  search  strategies  to  meet  the  information  need; Identify services used and problems encountered  by  scholars  in  the  library;  and 
Find  out  what  research  scholars  are  satisfied  with  information  resources. 
3.1  Hypothesis  and  Limitations 
(1)  There  is  no  significant  difference  in  the  use  of  
library resources and services among research  
scholars  in  different  disciplines 
(2) There is no significant difference in use of library  
resources  and  services  between  the  male  and  
female  scholars. 
The  study  is  limited  to  utilisation  of  library  resources and service by full-time research scholars  of  Karnatak  University,  who  are  pursuing  their  doctoral  degree  in  arts,  science,  commerce,  and  management. 
4.  MEtHODOLOGY  
A  sample  survey  was  conducted  of  the  total  population of research scholars from various Departments  of  Karnatak  University  Campus,  Karnatak  Science  and Arts College, Dharwad. The collected data was  analysed  by  using  SpSS  software.  
Sample size is influenced by number of factors,  including the purpose of the study, population size,

for  computing  the  sample  size  for  proportion.  The  total population size of research scholars was N=624,  then  sample  size  with  different  precision  levels  were  determined.In  total  population  of  considered  151  samples,  109  are  males  and  42  are  females.  Using the random numbers from scientific calculator,  selection has made sampling units from the population  of research scholars in the university. The stratified  random  sampling  mechanism  has  selected  for  the  sample  and  used  (Table  1). 
5. ANALYSIS AND  INt ERPREtAtION 
The chi-square test has been used for difference  of  proportions.  The  selection  of  Chi-square  test  is  justified  in  section  5.8  (Chi-square  test  for  independence). 
5.1  Frequency  of  Library  visit 
Table  2  reveals  that  daily  visit  to  the  library  is  popular among arts and commerce faculties. However,  science research scholars daily visiting  the library  is less observed, as the science faculties have lab  oriented system and they use the technology system  often  hence,  visiting  the  library  was  not  common.  
Whereas  arts  and  commerce  scholars  prefer  manual work and half of them prefer to visit library  daily  as  they  have  no  lab  visits,  on  the  other

hand,  science  scholars  prefer  to  visit  library  once  in  a  month  for  their  research  needs  due  to  time  constraints.  
5.2  Purpose  of  Library visit 
Table 3 indicates that, every research scholars   visit  library  to  consult  the  material  for  research,

seminar preparation, current updation, browse internet  and,  borrow  books.  Male  (92.30  %)  and  female  (100 %) in commerce and management scholars are  more frequently visiting the library. This is because  of  the  availability  of  new  research  materials  were  available  in  the  library.

It  is  observed  from  the  Table  4  that,  maximum  research  scholars  use  the  reference  materials  in  their  research  endeavour;  next  to  this  they  use  thesis/dissertation.  Arts  and  science  scholars  use  the  textbooks/monographs  more  as  compared  to  reference  materials  (it  is  reached  100  %  in  female  respondents  in  commerce  and  management)  and  thesis but in commerce and management the scholars  preferred  to  refer  periodicals  as  these  consist  of  recent  research.

5.4  Services  Used  in  Library 
A  study  conducted  by  Hussain  and  Krishna 
15 shows  that  services  like  reference  service,  current  awareness services, online search services, bibliographic  services  are  used  at  a  large  extent  by  users  in  a  library.  According  to  the  present  study  Table  5   shows  that  most  research  scholars  use  reference  services and bibliography services more frequently.  The  entire  scholars  used  reference  service  in  an  average of 71.06 %, with highest percentage observed  in  female  scholars  in  commerce  and  management,  next  in  arts  on  the  contrary,  consultancy  service  is  used  on  an  average  of  13.93  %.  
5.5  Representing  Search  Strategies 
From  Table  6,  it  is  observed  that  research  scholars  use  the  strategy  of  browsing  through  shelves  (78.35  %)  getting  information  from  friends

  observed  that  the  unavailability  condition  and  inadequate  library  resources  also  affect  the  use  of  library  resources.  Korobili,  Tilikidou  and  Delistavrou18   also  observed  many problems while seeking information in library.  It  is  noted  from  the Table  7  that  research  scholars  have  to  face  accountable  problems  which  includes  lack of time, insufficient internet access points, book  loan  period  as  oppose  to  unaccountable  problems  like  lack  of  space,  power  outrages,  lack  of  library  orientation  and  so  on.

Ranganadham  &  babu3   and  Mukherjee  &   prashant19   discussed  in  their  paper  the  level  of  satisfaction  of  the  users  which  is  seen  in  usage  of  library resources and services. Table 8 reveals that  the maximum of all research scholars are averagely  satisfied  followed  by  fully  satisfied  and  not  at  all  satisfied  users. 
5.8  Chi-square test  for  Independence 
When a sample is categorised on two attributes,  the  Chi-square  test  for  independence  is  used.  It  is  assumed that the sample is randomly selected from  the  population.  One  the  attributes  is  comprised  of  ‘r’ categories that are represented by the ‘r’ rows of  the contingency table, while the second attribute is  comprised of ’c’ categories that are represented by  the  ‘c’  columns  of  the  contingency  table. The  Chi- square tests or independence evaluates the general  hypothesis  at  the  two  attributes  are  independent  of  one  another.  Another  way  of  stating  the  two  attributes  are  independent  of  one  another  is  to

5.9 test  For  Difference  of  Proportion 
Chi-square  test  was  conducted  between  daily  visiting  libraries  against  gender.  Null  hypothesis,  H0:  is  that  Research  scholar’s  daily  visiting  the  library  is  independent  of  gender.  From  Table  11,  it  is  observed  that  the  null  hypothesis  is  valid.  The  result  is  statistically  not  significant  thereby  indicating  that  gender  and  daily  visiting  library  are  independent. 
This is used to test whether there is any significant  difference  between  the  population  proportions  with  respect  to  the  characteristic  under  study. 
Let ‘p1’ be the proportion of individuals favouring  characteristics under study in population–I, i.e., p represents  the  proportion  of  arts,  commerce  and 1 management  research  scholars.  Let  ‘p2’  be  the  proportion  of  individuals  favouring  to  characteristic

6.  ObSERvAtIONS  AND  DISCUSSIONS  
It is observed from the study, science research  scholars  visit  the  library  on  priority  basis,  prefer  ably on weekends and/or monthly to find some tools  and  techniques  for  their  research  often,  as  they  have  lab  oriented  research.  On  the  another  hand  scholars  in  arts  and  commerce  and  management  prefer  to  visit  library  daily  or  weekly  as  they  don’t  have  practical  oriented  research.  
From  the  study  it  was  that  noted,  that  almost  all  scholars  visit  the  library  to  consult  the  material  and  borrowing  books  for  their  research. This  helps  in updating and referring new research materials. It  was also observed that the commonly used materials  in  the  library,  here  also  observed  that  maximum  research scholars use textbooks/monographs, reference  materials  and  thesis/dissertation  to  a  large  extent  than  other  information  sources.  
It  is  noted  that  bibliography  and  reference  services are most used and popular services among   research  scholars  as  compared  to  other  services  like  book  loan  service  and  consultancy  services.  It  was found out that almost all research scholar use  and  adopt  search  strategies  are  browsing  through  shelves. While, arts research scholars use website  and  OpAC  less  as  compared  to  other  faculties,  it  shows  that  lack  of  computer  literacy  among  arts  research  scholars  can  be  the  reason  behind  this. 
Research  scholars  have  problem  of  scarcity  of  time,  short  duration  of  book  loan,  insufficient  internet  access  points.  The  study  shows  female  scholars  have  problem  of  lack  of  time  while  male  scholars face problem of insufficient internet access  points.  The  study  also  reveals  that,  maximum  of  research  scholars  are  less  satisfied,  followed  by

are  using  electronic  aids  to  find  out  the  digital  information sources and printed information sources.  However,  it  is  obsereved  less  among  the  science  and arts research scholars. So, it is suggested that  libraries  and  librarians  should  initiate  to  procure  and  disseminate  e-resources  to  its  users.
