The present bibliometric study has been undertaken with the view to understand the latest publication  distribution pattern of the articles published in Annals of Library and Information Studies  (ALIS) journal  during the last decade. Present analysis covers the areas like article distribution pattern, authorship pattern,  reference, and geographical distribution of authors, etc. At the time of data mining of said journal, 310  articles were published during the period 2002-2012. India since being the host country, as such proved  to be one of the major contributors of the journal in every respect. Individual contribution of authors to  the journal has been tabulated as per articles contributed, highlighted in their standing order. On average  7.04  articles  have  been  published  in  each  issue  of  each  volume. After  analysing  5307  references,  on  average 17.11 references have been assigned to each article. Researchers from 16 different countries  across  the  world  have  contributed  research  articles  to  the  journal  during  the  period  of  study.  65.81  %  articles contributed to the journal during the period of study are based on co-authorship pattern, unveiling  the fact that most of the research undertaken these days is on joint authorship pattern.

1. IntroductIon 
There  are  numerous  reasons  and  variety  of  purposes  for  which  bibliometric  studies  are  undertaken.  In  the  normal  course,  such  studies  are  undertaken  to  evaluate  research  output  of  a  particular subject during the particular period and it  help us to develop a scientific acumen towards the  potential  of  research  trend  in  a  particular  science.  Publication  of  qualitative  research  results,  type  and  kind  of  scientific  community  which  may  have  contributed  in  publishing  their  research  results  in  a particular journal, etc. Upholding above view, the  study aims to ascertain the research output of Annals  of  Library  and  Information  Studies  (ALIS)   journal  articles  published  during  the  period  2002-2012.  ALIS   is  one  the  leading  quarterly  journals  in  the  field  of  Library  and  Information  Science,  published  by  National  Institute  of  Science  Communication  and  Information  Resources  (NISCAIR),  New  Delhi,  India,  and  do  enjoy  fair  amount  of  popularity  at  global  level. 
Most of the bibliometric studies are undertaken  to assess the research productivity of an institution,  organisation, publications of particular subject or field,  research  results  published  in  a  particular  journal  or  any  other  similar  activity  which  is  confined  to  
literature or research growth and its evaluation through  quantitative techniques published during a particular  period. Journals since being the primary sources of  information as such undertaking bibliometric study to  assess the research growth in a particular discipline  is always advisable. The study article highlights the  various  facets  of  scholarly  content  published  by  this  journal  during  2002-2012,  examines  research  output  published  in  the  journal  during  the  period,  publication  and  authorship  pattern,  geographical  distribution  of  authors  and  reference  distribution.  The  journal  has  given  fair  amount  of  coverage  to  articles’ on bibliometrics, scientometrics, webometrics,  infometrics, etc. Citation pattern of the journal was  deliberately left out, as the same has already been  undertaken  by  Deshmukh1. 
2.  LIterAture  revIew 
Several bibliometric studies have been undertaken  by various researchers across the globe to understand  the  publication  distribution  pattern  of  a  particular  journal. Most of these studies are for those journals  which enjoy fair amount of popularity in a particular  discipline  at  global  level.  Tiew2,  et  al.,  Barkri  &  Willett3  and Rattan & Gupta

in  their  study  observed  that  27  %  articles  were  single authored and 73 % joint authored publications  with maximum contribution from Malaysia. Verma5, et al. carried out same kind of bibliometric analysis  of  ALIS   and  observed  that  there  are  more  single  author contributions in journal with Delhi topping the  list for most contributors. The study was undertaken  on  131  research  articles  published  in  ALIS  during  1999-2005 and the researchers observed that most  of  the  contributions  to  the  journal  were  as  single  author, and found that source journal was the most  cited  one.    
Mete  &  Deshmukh6   analysed  202  articles  of  Annals  of  Library  Science  and  Documentation,  published  during  the  period  1984-1993,  having  1824 citations found that source journal is the most  cited  publication  with  8  to  12  years  as  half  life  for  books and journals respectively. Deshmukh1  made a  citation analysis of articles published during 1997- 2010 in ALIS  and observed that the half life period  of  journals  and  books  in  library  and  information  science is 9 and 14 years respectively.  In a similar  study  undertaken  by  Kumar  &  Kumar7,  analysed  8093 citations of Journal of Oil Seed and Research published during 1993-2004, observed that majority  of  citations  (almost  70  %)  were  given  under  main  articles  and  rest  30  %  under  short  communication  and  other  write-ups.  Dixit  &  Katore8   in  a  similar  study  undertaken  on  the Journal  of  Indian  Society  for Cotton Improvement studied 327 articles which  included  3521  citation  published  over  1995-2004  concluded  that  71.93  %  citations  are  from  source  journal.

Before  the  analysis,  data  was  standardised  to  so  as  avoid  any  kind  of  misrepresentation  of  facts  or  coming  up  with  results  which  may  hamper  the  cause  of  study  undertaken  to  achieve  the  results  as  per  predefined  objectives.  
5. AnALySIS 
Keeping  in  view  the  nature  of  study,  the  data  analysis  of  the  present  study  was  done  by  putting  data into excel format to execute simple operations  like  addition,  subtraction,  drawing  percentage  etc.  Percentage  at  all  the  places  has  been  drawn  maximum  up  to  two  decimal  places  and  has  also  been  rounded  off  to  next  higher  value  at  second  percentile value where third percentile value emerged  above  0.005.  
5.1   y ear-wise distribution  of Articles 
Table 1 is a depiction of articles scattered over  11  volumes  of  Annals  of  Library  and  Information  Studies   published  quarterly,  each  volume  having  four  issues  published.  From  the  tabulation,  it  was  can see in that there was a steady increase in the  number of articles published in each volume of the  journal  (from  volume  49  to  59).  Volume  57  has  published  as  many  as  43  articles,  highest  among  all  under  study  with  average  articles  10.75  per  issue,  which  is  better  than  3.71  articles  over  7.04  articles  published  on  average  in  each  issue  during  the  entire  decade.  It  is  pertinent  to  mention  here  that issue 3 of volume 57 was published as special  issue  as  a  tribute  to  Eugene  Garfield,  information  scientist extraordinaire, on his 85th  birthday, covering  15  articles.

Table 5 shows distribution that has been crafted  to give wider and broader understanding to assess the  reference distribution of articles in most convenient  way.  On  the  whole  5307  references  were  cited  in  310 articles making it on average 17.11 references  per article. Vol. 51 represents lowest 7.57 references  per articles contrary to 24.16 references per article  by  Vol.  57.  From  volume  49  to  59,  one  can  see  there  is  an  increase  in  the  number  of  references  cited  against  each  article.  This  increase  in  the  number  of  references  can  be  owed  to  the  fact  that  more  and  more  journals  are  being  published  in
