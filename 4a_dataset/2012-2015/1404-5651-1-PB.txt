ABSTRACT
As digital information resources available online are increasing at an exponential rate, several practices
have evolved for the economic and effective delivery of such information to the end users. In this context,
consortia-based information services have gathered momentum world over during the last few years. Though,
there are several library consortia in India, UGC Infonet is mainly meant for universities controlled by UGC and
CeRA is meant for agricultural universities. This paper discusses utilisation of consortia-based digital information
resources by the post graduate and doctoral students of the Kerala Agricultural University, Thrissur. Results
show that cent percent of the students were familiar with the use of digital information resources available
online and 87.14 per cent of them used CeRA. Eighty two per cent students were acquainted with CeRA and
learned the required skills for the access and use of digital information resources through curriculum-based
courses like ‘library and information services’, ‘research methodology’, etc. The students in general would like
to strengthen the CeRA services by adding more resources and facilities.
Keywords: Digital resources, internet, e-journals consortia, university library

1. INTRODUCTION
Technologically speaking, several experiments,
innovations, and practices were tested in the field of
publishing of journals and their access by the libraries.
The advent of electronic or digital journals, online journals,
magazines, etc., have necessitated a thorough redefining of the serials control system of the libraries as
online magazines or journals are disseminated through
internet websites. The information and communication
technologies have made radical changes in the
conventional system of information processing and its
delivery and most of the universities offer courses in their
multiple campuses and also through their affiliated or
recognised colleges/institutions. In many universities,
courses are extensively being offered through distance
education mode also. Though academic libraries have
begun to build impressive portfolios of online services and
programmes for remote users, little notice is paid to
whether or not the initiatives are useful, successful, or
whether targeted users are even aware of their availability.
Indian universities constitute one of the largest higher
education systems in the world. Although, it is a great
challenge to ensure effective coordination and
communication, several programmes have already started
38

in India to provide a seamless supply of information
resources by way of access to journals and databases,
course materials, online lectures, etc., in electronic
format to the academic and research community. The
UGC, ICAR, AICTE, National Knowledge Commission,
National Knowledge Network, National Innovation
Council, etc., have done leading roles towards this end.
As the universities in India are broadly controlled by
two agencies like UGC and ICAR, the library and
information resources management and services are also
performed differently. While the universities under UGC
have formed UGC Infonet for consortia mode of journal
subscription and electronic information services, the
agricultural universities and agricultural research
institutes formed CeRA1 for the same purpose. Moreover,
there are several other consortia also in operation in India
for institutions under CSIR, DRDO, IITs, IIMs, etc.

1.1 Kerala Agricultural University
The Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) was
established by the Act 33 of 1971 of the Kerala State
Legislature, with a mission to achieve excellence in
agricultural education, research and extension for

sustainable agricultural development and livelihood
security of farming community. Its goal is to provide
human resources, skills and technology required for
sustainable development of agriculture, including crop
production, animal husbandry, veterinary sciences, dairy
sciences & technology, co-operation, fisheries, forestry,
agricultural engineering, home science and other allied
disciplines by integrating education, research, and
extension. The University fulfills its obligations and
commitments through a network of institutions spread
over 36 campuses through the length and breadth of the
state, consisting of ten constituent colleges, six regional
agricultural research stations, 26 research stations, three
centres of advanced studies, seven Krishi Vigyan Kendras
and various other research programmes. It has a three-tier
system of libraries comprising of the university library at
the top. College and research station libraries are in the
second and third levels, respectively.

2. OBJECTIVES OF STUDY
The purpose of the study was to explore the
awareness and usage of consortia-based information and
knowledge resources by the post graduate (PG) and
doctoral students of KAU. The main objectives were to:
•

Evaluate the pattern of access and use of digital
resources by the PG and doctoral students

•

Find out the purposes for which the digital resources
were used

•

Assess the impact of consortia-based delivery of
digital resources

•

Know the adequacy of resources available through
the CeRA

•

Assess the provision and impact of user education
and information literacy courses for PG and doctoral
students

•

Suggest suitable measures to improve the consortiabased delivery of digital resources

2.1 Scope and Limitation
The study is based on the user behaviour and the
pattern of the utilisation of information resources by the
PG and doctoral students of KAU. The scope of the study
is limited to the digital resources mainly available through
CeRA and in KAU.

2.2 Review of Literature
Information resources in the form of journals occupy a
pivotal position in any university or research library. The
citation analysis of doctoral dissertation in chemistry
reveals that the researchers mainly depend on periodicals
for their information use2. A proper control and
management of journals is important for meeting the
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

users’ needs effectively. The two major problems
associated with the serials management are the
multiplication of number of journals published and the
steep increase in their prices. Based on a survey on more
than 8000 scholarly journals of leading international
publishers, White and Creaser3 reported that journal
prices are estimated to have increased by 39 per cent
between 2001 and 2006, while the retail price index has
risen by 16 per cent over the same period3. Such crucial
situations coupled with paucity of funds forced the
libraries to try out several experiments and adopt new
practices in the area of acquisition, management, and
servicing of journals. The composition of the journal
collection of libraries has changed dramatically. The
percentage of print-only subscriptions decreased and ejournals jumped to high. The proliferation of e-resources
had a major impact on the acquisition activities right from
handling physical objects to initiating and ensuring
ongoing access to e-resources. It has resulted in a
workflow that requires an ongoing review and change in
order to accommodate the constant technological
developments that have impacted the management of
information delivered electronically.
In order to
scientifically move the library from a predominantly print
environment to a predominantly electronic environment,
the management processes have been re-engineered4.
According to VijayaKumar and Vijayakumar5, though
e-journals created several technological and social
issues, it provided better facilities in terms of
accessibility, speed of distribution and production,
subscription cost, multimedia capabilities, etc.
One major collateral blessing to emerge from the rise
of online information is the incentives that it offers to
libraries to work together for mutual benefit. This can best
be seen in the very active effort exerted by many library
consortia to obtain group pricing for their members for
electronic information products. Vendors have been very
receptive to these because it significantly lessens the
amount of marketing costs that they would have to bear to
prepare their case in each individual library. The difference
between buying it alone and buying through a consortium
can be very vast and is particularly useful for libraries that
already license a product without such a discount. Those
who have not licensed products for cost reasons may well
find themselves able to do so. The library economizes in
the first case and expands its services in the second;
there is an economic benefit to both of these6. The
e-journals service of the UGC Infonet is very popular
amongst the scholarly community and was sought after
by universities and colleges, who do not have the benefit
of access to e-resources through the programmes. The
UGC Infonet Services have now been extended to more
than 200 universities and six inter-university centres.
Bostick7 argued that the buying power of the libraries
for better prices has increased under the consortia mode.
39

In the present system of multi-disciplinary education,
research, and extension, it is a fact that all journals and
databases are relevant to all universities with varied
degree of interest. In the broader sense, though the areas
of interest are similar and the major funding agency for
these consortia is Central and State Governments in
India, several consortia activities by different agencies are
taking place in the country. This causes duplication of
efforts and increase in costs and inefficiency8. Libraries
outside the stream of agriculture hold very important and
otherwise not available information on agriculture, which
is original, traditional and sustainable9.

2.2.1

Partnerships and Resource Sharing

As no library in the world is self-reliant, collaboration
and active partnership are the order of the day to win
maximum benefits. There are several good partnerships in
the LIS field. AgNIC10, (Agriculture Network Information
Centre) stands as one of National Agricultural Library
(NAL) strongest and broadest partnerships extended to
members around the world. Today, with technology
rapidly advancing and budgets shrinking almost as fast,
these partnerships are more important than ever. They
provide a broad range of cost savings, including leveraging
resources, sharing skills and collaborating on projects.
Each partner brings something to the table and also
benefits from the outcome.
Though co-operation and partnership is the perfect
need of the day, most of the libraries or universities in
India are not able to develop even OPACs or Web OPACs
of all books, journals and other information resources
available in their universities. This situation has practically
denied the possibilities of library cooperation and
resource sharing between universities and research
institutions in India though ICTs offers an immense scope
for such programmes. As most of the university libraries
have memberships in library consortia and library
networks and they claim the provision for inter-library loan
services, only small percentage of the users have
knowledge about such services. This underlines the need
for re-engineering and re-defining the partnerships
between libraries and strengthen inter-library loan
services. Institutional tie-ups with other libraries and
networks, intensified user education and training
programmes and adoption of latest ICTs and web
technologies for digital document delivery, strengthening
the ICT competency of the library and information
professionals, etc., are few basic areas need re-defining
and re-engineering to strengthen the service.

2.2.2

Library Website as a Clearing Centre of
Information

One of UNESCO’s11 priorities is to promote universal
access to information and to strengthen communication
capacities at the local level. It emphasises the
40

importance of websites for effective access of information
resources available world over. Several universities and
libraries have already adopted the library website as an
important tool for information delivery. Library users also
prefer to avail information services through the library
websites. As websites becoming important means for
information services, it is essential to design the websites
with utmost care and effectiveness. Hence, many libraries
have changed their websites into content management
system. Library websites should employ technical skills
to transform them as a proper clearing centre of
information. In this role, the librarian has to function as
Web content manager. Corcoran12 stated that, even
though the library spends a huge amount of money on
resources, and if a user has inability or difficulty in
accessing them and as a result does not use them, the
money has been wasted.
Lebowitz13 observed that, “Although many consider
the library to be the heart of the university, the use of the
library is often not incorporated into courses being
prepared for distance delivery …. as academic
institutions extend their educational offerings beyond the
campus, to rural, suburban, and urban locations, they
need to consider… the role that the library plays in the
educational process”. She recommends that librarians
convince fellow educators and administrators that as they
are expanding their institutions’ educational offerings
beyond the campus boundaries, they need to provide their
students with access to library services, which include
among others, instruction in use of resources, document
delivery, and communication facility between the students
and librarian. Studies on the libraries in Kerala State
revealed that several issues have to be addressed by the
libraries in order to meet the information needs of the
users. Among these issues were: the need to have more
information resources available online that can be
accessed remotely, effective inter-library and digital
document delivery services, strengthening of information
literacy and user education programmes with stress on
ICTs, retrieval software and search tools, and reengineering the management of human resources of
libraries14.

3. METHODOLOGY ADOPTED
The study was conducted among the PG and
research students of KAU. As the colleges of KAU are
spread over the entire state of Kerala, for the convenient
and effective execution of the study, out of a total of 10
constituent colleges of the university, only five colleges
situated in the central part of the state and offering PG
and/or doctoral courses have been covered for the study.
These colleges were: College of Horticulture (CoH),
College of Forestry (CoF), College of Co-operation,
Banking and Management (CCBM), Kelappaji College of
Agricultural Engineering and Technology (KCAET) and
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Mannuthy
(COVAS). These colleges offer courses like BSc (Hons)Agriculture; MSc–Agriculture/Forestry/Co-operation &
Banking/Biotechnology/Climate Change; BVSc; MVSc;
BTech/MTech-Agricultural Engineering; MBA–Agricultural
Business
Management;
and
PhD–Agriculture/
Horticulture/Home Science/Biotechnology/Forestry and
Wild Life/Rural Banking/ Marketing/Veterinary and Animal
Sciences, etc.
Data was mainly collected using a pre-structured
interview schedule. As a course teacher of ‘library and
information services’; and ‘research methodology’ for the
PG and doctoral courses of the university, the investigator
has made additional discussions with the students and
enriched the data thus collected. The data was collected
from total 140 PG and PhD students admitted during
2008-10, tabulated, and analysed.

5. FINDINGS

The following recommendations are made to improve
the access and use of digital information resources and
CeRA by the PG and doctoral students:

The following are the major observations based on
the study:

•

Consortia-based digital information services should
be strengthened by adding more resources like
journals, books, databases, theses, reports, union
catalogue of all information documents available in all
libraries. The document delivery service should be
more effective and inter-consortia services between
other consortiums maintained by agencies like ICAR,
UGC, CSIR, DRDO, IITs, IIMs, etc., can be
considered.

•

Information literacy and user education courses with
emphasis on retrieval software, tools and techniques
of searching, etc., should be provided to all categories
of the users. Adequate practical sessions should be
included in such courses.

•

•

All PG students and research scholars were familiar
with the use of digital resources. The students using
internet based information resources, online journals,
CD-ROM databases and online databases were 100
per cent, 91.43 per cent, 69.29 per cent, and 25.71
per cent respectively. Their preferred location to
access the digital information resources is the
computer centre and then college and university
libraries.
While all students were accessing and using
information resources freely available through
internet; resources available through CeRA were used

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

43

•

High speed internet, more computer terminals, round
the clock service of the libraries and computer
centres, web OPAC and other supportive information
for inter-library services in the library websites, etc.,
should be provided by the universities/colleges.

7. CONCLUSIONS
The exponential growth of digital information
resources has necessitated consortia-based services for
the economic and effective delivery of information to the
end users. CeRA of ICAR has become a heavily-used
service by the students. Curriculum-based information
literacy courses like 'library and information services',
'research methodology', etc., have contributed much
towards imparting required skills for the access and use
of digital information resources. Strengthening of CeRA
services by adding more resources and facilities will
provide strong information support for the education,
research, and extension programmes.
