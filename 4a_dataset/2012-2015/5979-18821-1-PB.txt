AbSTRAcT 
The present study is aimed at analysing the global publication trends on food preservation using Scopus  database for the period 1998-2012. The database contained 17511 publications on food preservation. The  study  analysed  the  broad  features  of  literature  on  food  preservation  focusing  on  year-wise  distribution  of  publications,  highly  productive  countries,  international  collaboration,  activity  index,  highly  productive  institutes, methods of food preservation, preservation by food types, and channels of communication.   
Keywords: Food preservation, scientometric analysis, institutional productivity 
1.  InTRoducTIon 
To  ensure  food  and  nutrition  security  of  more  than  nine  billion  people  is  a  daunting  task  for  the  entire world. To feed humanity, it requires increased  production  of  grains,  pulses,  oilseeds,  vegetables,  fruits, milk, poultry, fish, meat, etc. Preservation of  food is equally important to deal with the increased  production  as  both  animal  and  plant  products  are  exposed  to  decomposition  through  biochemical  changes,  decay,  fermentation  by  microorganisms,  and destruction by pests. It is believed that insects  and  pests  destroy  more  grain  in  storage  than  is  distributed.  This  calls  for  better  storage  and  preservation  facilities. 
Food preservation is the process of treating and  handling  food  to  stop  or  slow  down  spoilage  (loss  of quality, edibility or nutritional value). Preservation  usually  involves  preventing  the  growth  of  bacteria,  yeast,  fungi,  and  other  micro-organisms,  as  well  as  retarding  the  oxidation  of  fats  which  cause  rancidity. Food preservation helps in: increasing the  self-life  of  perishable  foods;  making  the  seasonal  food  available  throughout  the  year;  adding  variety  to  the  diet;  saving  time  by  reducing  preparation  time  and  energy,  as  the  food  has  already  been  partially  processed;  stabilising  prices  of  food,  as  there is less scope of shortage of supply to demand;  decreasing wastage of food by preventing decay or  spoilage of food; and improving the nutrition of the  population.  Preserved  foods  help  people  to  bring  avariety  in  the  diet,  thereby  decreasing  nutritional  inadequacies.  With  the  advent  of  research,  many  methods  of  food  preservation  such  as  physical,  chemical,  microbial,  radiation,  refrigeration,  etc.,  have  been  developed.  A  lot  of  research  is  being  carried  out  all  over  the  world  in  this  area. 
Vijay1  analysed the research publications of Indian  food scientists and technologists and found that the  degree  of  collaboration  among  food  scientists  and  technologists was 0.91. Poornima2, et al.  analysed  1060  publications  by  Indian  scientists  published  during 1998 to 2010 on food science and technology  and  studied  relative  growth  rate,  documents  type,  collaboration  pattern,  prolific  authors,  institutes,  journals,  and  citations  scores  in  the  field.  A  study  by Hemantha Kumar3, et al.   evaluated the initiatives  taken  by  India  in  the  field  of  agriculture  and  food  sciences to make the intellectual output accessible  for  all  by  publishing  them  in  open  access  journals  and  repositories.  Salisbury4,  et  al.   analysed  the  publication  and  citation  patterns  of  food  science  faculty at the University of Arkansas for a fourteen- year  period  (1990-2003).  Alfaraz  &  Calvino5   have  analysed  of  the  scientific  production  in  the  food  science  and  technology  field  for  the  period  1991- 2000  in  Iberian-America  (IA).  Many  such  studies  have  been  carried  out  in  variuos  fields6,7. 
2.   o bjecTIveS 
The  main  objective  of  the  study  is  to  update  the  information  available  on  food  preservation  and  present  the  growth  of  literature  and  make  the  quantitative  assessment  of  food  preservation  research by way of analysing the following aspects  of  research  output:  
(i)  Year-wise  growth  
(ii)  Methods  of  food  preservation  
(ii)  Preservation  by  food  types  
(iv)  Highly  productive  countries  
(v)  International  collaboration

3. MATeRIAl S And  MeThodS 
Data  was  collected  from  the  Scopus  database  (1998-2012). SCOPUS  database is one of the very  comprehensive bibliographic databases covering all  aspects of science & technology. The search string  ‘FOOD  PRESERV*’  was  given  in  the  ‘article  title,  abstract and keyword’ field of the Scopus database  to  retrieve  the  data. A  total  of  17511  records  were  downloaded and analysed by using the spreadsheet  application  as  per  the  objectives  of  the  study.

4.1  Year-wise  distribution  of  Publications  and  
citations 
A total of 17511 publications were published during  1998-2012. The average number of publications per  year was 1167.4. Figure 1 gives the year-wise growth  of publications. There were only 459 publications in  1998  and  a  continuous  growth  of  publications  was  observed during 1998-2012. The highest publications  (2407) were in 2008. It was observed that there was a  steady  growth  of  publications  during  1998-2012.  
These  publications  have  received  235166  citations  during  1998-2012.  The  highest  number  of  citations  (25863)  were  in  2008.  The  average  citations per year was 15678. The average citations  per  publication  was  13.43.  There  is  a  declining  trend  of  citations  in  food  preservation  research  in  the  world  during  2009-2012.  It  is  well  known  that   the older publications tend to receive more citations  than recent publications as the publications require  more  time  to  be  noticed  by  the  researchers  and  to  find  the  context  to  cite  them. 
4.2 Methods  of  Food  Preservation 
Figure  2  gives  the  distribution  of  publications  according  to  methods  of  food  preservation.  The  publications on food preservation were classified into  seven broad categories available in the literature. Out  of the total publications, ‘microbial’ method of food  preservation  accounted  for  the  highest  percentage  (30  %)  of  publications,  followed  by  ‘chemical’  with  27  %  of  publications.

  methods of food preservation. 
4.3  Preservation  by  Food  Types 
Figure 3 gives the distribution of publications on  preservation  of food by food types. The publications  on preservation by food types were classified into eight  broad categories available in the literature. Out of the  total  publications,  ‘meat’  accounted  for  the  highest  percentage (20 %) of publications, followed by fruits’  and ‘oil seeds’ with 18 % of publications each, ‘dairy  products’ with 16 % of publications and  ‘sea food’  and  ‘vegetables’  each  with  10  %  of  publications.
