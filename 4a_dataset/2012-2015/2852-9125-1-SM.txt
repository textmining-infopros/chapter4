ABSTRACT
Health care is one of the field in which constant research is going on. Research has been amplified in
the last decade. The main objective of this paper is to compare the quality of research output of the two high
profile health care institutions of North India—All India Institute of Medical Science, New Delhi and Post Graduate
Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh. The study has been conducted using Scopus citation
database. In this paper, research output of these institutions during 1999-2008 has been compared in the form
of growth of publication, rank of various subjects, further citations of these publications has been observed
to check the quality of the research using three year window in addition to the h-index as well as the
International collaboration of publications (ICP). Except difference in total number of publications, growth, rank,
quality and ICP all are almost the same. Difference in number of publications can be due to the limitations of
the study and duration of establishment of these institutes. Earlier, due to paucity of means to gauge the quality
of the research, it was not possible to observe the quality of the research. Hence, an effort has been made
to create awareness amongst the medical fraternity about the quality check of their research, which is now
possible through these citation databases.
Keywords: All India Institute of Medical Science, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 All India Institute of Medical Sciences

Research is defined as human activity based on
intellectual application in the investigation of matter. It
includes gathering of data, information, and facts for the
advancement of knowledge. Easy availability of eresources and e-databases has amplified the research
today. It is increasing at such a high speed that
sometimes quality of research gets ignored. Hence, the
quality check of research is the need of the hour. One
study estimated that there are 40,000 journals for the
sciences and that the researchers are filling those
journals at the rate of one article every 30 seconds, 24
hours a day and seven days a week. In gauging the
quantity and quality of research, citation databases have
been playing an important role. Two main world-wide
interdisciplinary S&T bibliographical databases, namely,
Web of Science and Scopus are currently being used
worldwide. In this paper, quality and quantity of two high
quality, health care institutes, namely, All India Institute of
Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi and Post Graduate
Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER),
Chandigarh has been discussed.

The AIIMS was established as an institution of
national importance by an Act of Parliament with the
objects to develop patterns of teaching in undergraduate
and post graduate medical education in all its branches
so as to demonstrate a high standard of medical
education in India; to bring together in one place
educational facilities of the highest order for the training of
personnel in all important branches of health activity; and
to attain self-sufficiency in post-graduate medicaleducation. The Institute provides comprehensive facilities
for teaching, research and patient-care. Teaching and
research are conducted in 42 disciplines. In the field of
medical research, AIIMS leads, having more than 600
research publications (national and international) by its
faculty and researchers in a year1.

1.2 Post Graduate Institute of Medical
Education and Research
The PGIMER, inaugurated in 1962, was originally
under the Government of undivided Punjab. After the

reorganisation of the state, the administrative control of
the institute passed on to the Union Territory of
Chandigarh in November 1966. The Institute became an
autonomous body under the Act of Parliament in 1967
functioning under the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, Government of India. It undertakes research in
the areas of tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, diarrhoea,
fertility control, family planning, blindness, cancer,
community health, parasitic diseases, tetanus,
preventable oral diseases, child health and nutrition, etc.
A unique feature of research at this Institute is the
establishment of the Department of Experimental
Medicine which helps various clinical departments to have
an in-depth research at the level of molecular biology and
basic sciences to correlate with the various clinical
problems, e.g., hypertension, coronary artery disease,
rheumatic heart diseases, mal-absorption, etc. The
research output of PGIMER has been incredible and has
found recognition at the various national and international
forums. Every year more than 500 research papers
(national and international) are published in national and
international journals. A number of departments of
PGIMER have been designated as research centres by
WHO and various national agencies2.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Some relevant studies have been undertaken on the
evaluation of the research output of different institutions of
India. Ranking of institutions has also been done. Jeevan,
& Gupta3, studied the profile of a research university, with
a view to get an idea about the performance and impact of
research produced in each department, and has also
compared the impact of research in various departments.
Nagpaul4 in his paper has analysed the pattern of
cooperation links among fifty most prolific institutions in
India. His study described that the network of
relationships among these institutions is sparse and
more than two third of the cells in the collaboration matrix
are empty. The network is centralised, but no institution
dominates the network. It is only a set of few institutions
that dominate the network. He has graphically depicted
the network of relationships among these institutions
above a certain threshold of cooperation strength. The
block model indicated the isolation and marginality of
certain clusters (or blocks) of institutions.
Kumbar5, et al. described the growth, contribution and
impact of research carried out by the scientists of
University of Mysore in science and technology. Their
study indicated the patterns of communication of
university scientists and also studied the extent of
concentration and scattering of their research output in
different journals. They have analysed the strong and
weak areas of university research, their growth rate and
impact in terms of average citations received. They also
studied the output and impact of research under different
534

existing subject and departments of the university. They
further analysed the international collaborative share of
research output at the overall level as well as across
various subjects.

Gupta3 et al. have analysed top pharmaceutical

institutes of Inida. Their study showed that they have
witnessed a major shift in their rankings measured on the
basis of four indicators, viz. total papers publication
output, impact in terms of average citations received per
paper, h-index value and performance indicator p-index.
According to their study, IICT, Hyderabad tops the list in
terms of all for indicators i.e. quantity of papers, quality of
papers, h-index and p-index. The 2nd rank is achieved by
CDRI, Lucknow by publishing 845 papers, NCL, Pune by
achieving the impact of 7.30 citations per paper, UIPSPU, Chandigarh by scoring h-index value of 36 and
NIPER, Mohali registered the p-index of 9.36. Their study
concluded that although there are several ranking
methods used in literature for comparison, but the authors
of this communication have based the ranking on
quantitative parameters such as the number of raw count
of papers (P), qualitative parameters (such as mean
citation rate (C/P)), and a combination of both quantitative
and qualitative parameters (such as h-index and p-index).
The authors leave it to the readers to decide which
method is the best and most suitable in their own
environment.
However, the present study would compare the quality
and quantity of the research output of two high profile
medical institutes of India.

3. OBJECTIVES
The main focus of the study is to analyse:

•

Publication share of the top most productive eight
subjects of PGI and AIIMS

•

Growth of publications during the period 1999-2008

•

Rank of these subject during the years 1999-03 and
further 2004-08

•

Quality and quantity of the research work through
citations and h-Index, and

•

International collaboration of both the institutes during
the same period.

4. MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study is based on the publication output as
indexed by Scopus database for the period 1999-2008.
The study uses 10 years publications data from 1999 to
2008. In addition, it used citations data for measuring
quality and visibility of these institutions research output.
Three years citations window has been used for
computing the quality of the research.

5. LIMITATIONS

6.2 Subject-wise Growth of Publications

As both the institutes have many subjects/
departments under their control, only eight most
productive subjects for their publications reflected in
Scopus database have been considered for this study,
without considering human resource, clinical activities,
patient’s burden and courses offered and budget allocated
to a particular subject/department.

6.2.1 AIIMS

6. DISCUSSIONS
6.1 Subject-wise Publications
6.1.1 AIIMS
As reflected in Scopus database, most productive 8
subjects of AIIMS have contributed 9838 number of papers
during 1999-2008 with total citations of 20995, so average
contribution of papers of a subject is 1229 papers. Only one
subject, i.e. Medicine, has contributed more than average
papers with a total contribution of 6737 papers. Second is
Biochemistry with 1216 papers which are quite near to the
average contribution as shown in Table 1.

6.1.2 PGIMER
Whereas most productive 8 subjects of PGI have
contributed 5552 papers with total citations 11439 during
1998-2008. Similar to AIIMS, only one subject, i.e.,
Medicine, has contributed more than average papers and
Biochemistry has contributed near average (Table 2).

Growth of publications of AIIMS for these subjects can
be seen in Table 3. Overall the growth rate from 1999-03 to
2004-2008 is 36.62 per cent. Highest growth rate is of
Dentistry with 64.29 per cent, followed by Neurology with
50.60 per cent, Immunology 47.69 per cent, Biochemistry
with 42.69 per cent, Medicine 35.48 per cent, Public Health
32.60 per cent, Pharmacology 8.99 per cent and Physics
has negative growth, i.e., 6.12 per cent.
Publications growth of all these subjects has improved
during 1999-2008. It is very clear from Table 3 that during
2004-2008, all the subjects have contributed more papers
than during 1999-2003 except one subject, i.e., Physics,
which has contributed 52 papers during 1999-2003 and 49
papers during 2004-2008. All the subjects contributed
almost double papers during 2004-2008 than 1999-2003
except Pharmacology which has shown very little growth
with 243 papers during 1999-03 and 267 papers during 20042008.

6.2.2 PGIMER
Growth of publications of these subjects in PGIMER
can be seen in Table 4 with total growth of 32.06 per cent.
Maximum growth is of Nursing with 85 per cent followed
by Dentistry with 52.17 per cent, Public Health with 48.21
per cent, and Medicine with 35.73 per cent, and

If the rank of these subjects of AIIMS during 19992003 and during 2004-2008 is analysed, all the subjects
have maintained the same rank except few subjects like
Pharmacology which has lost by two ranks as it was at 3rd
rank during 1999-2003 and 5th rank during 2004-2008.
Immunology has also gained 1 rank during 2004-2008.

Biochemistry with 33.25 per cent, and Immunology with
31.22 per cent. Unlike AIIMS, PGIMER has two subjects
with negative growth. These include-Neurology (27.96 per
cent) and Pharmacology (14.50 per cent). When we see
the growth of publications of PGI for all these subjects,
similar to AIIMS a good growth can be seen for all the
subjects except Neurology and Pharmacology. These two

As far as the rank position of PGIMER for the same
subjects is concerned. Medicine, Biochemistry, Public
Health, and Neurology has maintained their rank during
1999-2008, i.e., 1st, 2nd, 5th & 6th respectively. Immunology
and nursing has gained their rank positions from 4th during
1999-2003 to 3rd rank during 2004-2008. Nursing has also
gained one rank from 8th to 7th during 2004-2008. Rest of the
two subjects which have lost one rank during 2004-2008 are
Pharmacology and Dentistry. Hence, we can say that the
rank positions like growth of publications showed not much
difference for these institutions (Table 6).

6.4 Subject-wise h-index of Publications
6.4.1 AIIMS
The quantity of the research can be seen from number
of papers these subjects have contributed. Similarly, we
can see the quality of these research papers through hindex. Total h-index of these subjects is 186 and the
average h-index is 23. Four subjects have higher h-index
than the average. Rest of the subjects with lower h-index
than the average includes neurology, Public Health,
Physics and Dentistry as is shown in Table 7.

6.4.2 PGIMER
The quality of the research papers as seen through hindex for PGIMER, it is almost same as that of AIIMS.
Four subjects have higher h-index than the average and
rest 4 has lower h-index. Total h-index of these subjects is
128 and average h-index is 16 (Table 8). Hence, the hindex status of both the instiutions is almost the same.

6.5 Subject-wise International Collaboration
of Publications
6.5.1 AIIMS
Using the Scopus database, the research
collaboration of these two institutes with other countries
was also noted. It was seen that 1113 ICP papers have
been contributed by these top most productive subjects of

AIIMS, out of which Medicine has contributed 665 papers
which itself is more than 50 per cent. Second contribution
is from Biochemistry which has contributed 208 papers.
Immunology is at number 3 with a contribution of 109 papers.
Rest of the subjects has contributed almost same number of
papers. Major contribution for ICP is from Medicine, followed
by Biochemistry and Immunology respectively. If we
compare the total papers and ICP shares, then immunology
has contributed 23.3 per cent. Similarly, Physics has
contributed 18.8 per cent ICP of the total papers, followed by
Nursing with 18.46 per cent ICP and biochemistry with 17.1
per cent as is shown in Table 9.

6.5.2 PGIMER
Table 10 indicates that top 8 subjects of PGI have
contributed a total of 502 ICP during 1999-2008. Like
AIIMS, Medicine has also contributed almost 50 per cent
of ICP of PGIMER, followed by Public Health with 86 ICP
and Biochemistry contributed 50 ICP. Rest of the subjects
has contributed almost same number of ICP with very rare
difference. So, like AIIMS in PGIMER Medicine subject
has major contribution of ICP followed by Public Health
and Biochemistry.

7. CONCLUSIONS
The analysis of the data indicates that contributions of
total papers is higher in the case of AIIMS with a total of
9838 papers and 20995 citations, whereas PGIMER has
contributed 5552 papers with 11439 citations. This may
be due to the fact that human resources, clinical

activities, courses offered, and budget allocations for
research and the infrastructure for these subjects may be
different (higher or lower) from each other, which are the
limitations of this study. Otherwise, growth of publications
of these subjects in AIIMS and PGIMER is almost the
same and percentage share is also the same except the
difference of one subject (Physics) for which growth has
been shown negative in case of AIIMS and two subjects
(Pharmacology and Neurology) in case of PGIMER.

maximum contribution with 244 papers. Hence, it can be
concluded that except the difference in total number of
papers that can be due to the limitations of the study, both
the institutions have almost the same status of growth,
rank maintenance, h-index, and ICP.

Similarly, the rank maintenance of these subjects of
two institutions is almost the same. Pharmacology and
Dentistry have lost their ranks during 2004-2008 and
Immunology, Neurology, and Nursing have gained their
ranks in case of AIIMS. Similarly, for PGIMER, four
subjects have maintained the same ranks during 19992003 and 2004-2008, whereas immunology and Nursing
have gained one rank during 2008-2008 and
Pharmacology, and Dentistry have lost one rank each
during 2004-2008. Total h-Index of the subjects of AIIMS is
186, whereas h-index of these subjects of PGIMER is
128. Higher h-index shows higher quality of research but
in this study quantity level is different may be due to the
limitations of the study. As reflected in Scopus, AIIMS has
contributed 1113 ICP with the maximum contribution from
medicine with 665 papers (more than 50 %). Similarly,
PGIMER has contributed 502 ICP and medicine has
