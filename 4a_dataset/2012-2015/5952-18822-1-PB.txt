AbstrAct 
The present paper examines the generic structure of acknowledgements appearing in the DESIDOC  
Journal of Library & Information Technology  ( DJLIT) covering the period 1998-2013. There are 9.04 %  
articles which contained acknowledgements. Acknowledgements appearing in these articles have been  classifed  using  eight  layer  topology  which  refected  the  composite  nature  of  acknowledgements.  Peer  
interactive communication (PIC) acknowledgements are highest (29.16 %) and Editorial/ linguistics support  
(E/LS) acknowledgements are lowest (1.04 %). Further individuals acknowledged in PIC acknowledgements  
along with their institutional affliations have also been discussed.

1. IntroductIon 
Acknowledgements allow researchers to reflect  their  gratitude  for  any  kind  of  help  received  from  others during the writing of articles.  They, in general,  occur  in  response  to  social  expectations  sharing  the  tendency  to  reflect  reciprocal  gift  giving  for  all  kinds of contributions (mental, physical, etc.) to the  work1.  They  reflect  a  combination  of  interpersonal,  academic,  institutional,  technical,  financial,  and  moral  support  to  the  person(s)  or  institutions  for  their  diverse  contributions.  
Acknowledgements offer writers a unique rhetorical  space not only to convey their debt for the intellectual  and  personal  assistance  they  received  but  also  to  promote  a  capable  academic  and  social  identity.  They are often made to imply significant intellectual  debt.  However,  they  may  be  made  for  a  number  of  other  reasons  also.  Like  citations,  they  reflect  influential  contribution  in  research  publications  of  scientific literature. Citations are formal expression of  debt whereas acknowledgements are more personal,  singular  or  private  expression  of  appreciation  and  contribution2. According to Hyland3, acknowledgements  are  neither  strictly  academic  nor  entirely  personal;  they  seem  to  fall  through  the  cracks  of  the  third  category  and  represent  a  ‘Cinderella’  genre. 
The importance of acknowledgements is highlighted  by  results  of  surveys  showing  the  frequency  with  which  they  occur  in  scholarly  texts.  They  are  particularly  important  for  scholars  to  demonstrate  their  awareness  of  some  central  values  such  as

modesty and gratitude. They are compound entities  in  which  authors  may  thank  colleagues  for  ideas,  funding agencies for support, experts for suggestions  to  improve  the  articles,  etc.4   It  is  very  rare  that  the  bibliometric  techniques  have  been  used  to  acknowledgement data to information science. However,  there  are  few  studies  conducted  on  practice  and  pattern  of  acknowledgements  and  Blaise  Cronin  is  pioneer  in  the  study  of  acknowledgements.  Three  studies were conducted by Tiew5,6, Tiew & Sen7  and  another study by Rattan8   showing  the  existence  of  acknowledgements  in  Malaysian  learned  journals  and Indian journal respectively. The present study is  based on the analysis–acknowledgements appearing  in  Indian  journal DESIDOC  Journal  of  Library  and  Information Technology  ( DJLIT) covering the period  1998-2013.  
2. LIterAture survey 
Acknowledgements  have  been  of  considerable  interest  to  genre  analysts  and  following  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  the  same: 
Mackintosh9  examined acknowledgements pattern  in Sociology in an unpublished dissertation. A three  tier  classification  scheme  was  adopted  to  study  acknowledgements in American Sociological Review.  He  further  concluded  that  the  lack  of  interest  of  Bibliometrician in acknowledgement does not indicate  their  irrelevance. 
Cronin,  Mckenzie  &  Stiffer10   explored  the  significance  of  acknowledgements  in  Journal  of

DJLIT,  VOL.  34,  NO.  3, MAy  2014 
American  Society  for  Information  Science  ( JASIS)  for 1970-1990. A six layer topology was developed  by  Cronin,  namely,  (a)  trusted  assessor,  (b)  moral  support,  (c)  technical  support,  (d)  Dogsbody,  (e)  paymasters,  and  (f)  prime  mover.  Again  Cronin11 had undertaken a range of acknowledgement studies  covering  the  journal  literature  of  fields  as  History,  Information  Science,  Psychology,  and  Sociology.  
Giannoni12   had  analysed  acknowledgements  in  English  and  Italian  research  articles  for  their  socio-pragmatic  construction  and  textualisation.  They  manifested  in  their  move  structural  patterns  to  determine  how  research  article  writers  organise  and express their debts and gratitude to their peer  academics.  Hyland3   explored  the  textualisation  of  gratitude within 240 MA and PhD dissertations from  six  academic  fields  written  by  non-native  English  speaking  students  at  five  Hong  Kong  universities.  Hyland13   in  another  study  analysed  the  same  acknowledgement data for their move structure. He  found that instances of this genre consist of three- move  components:  an  optional  reflecting  move,  a  main obligatory thanking move and another optional  announcing  move.  In  a  subsequent  study,  Hyland  &  Tse14   explored  the  lexico-grammatical  patterns  used  to  realise  the  component  moves  of  the  same  acknowledgment  texts. 
Salager-Meyer15,  et  al.   a n a l y s e d   t h e  acknowledgement paratext of medical research articles  written in English and Spanish in Venezuela, Spanish  and the United States of America. Again, Salager- Meyer16, et  al.   analysed  the  acknowledgements  in  medical articles published in five countries (Venezuela,  Spain,  France,  UK,  and  USA)  from  1950  to  2010.  Papers  written  by  native  speakers  in  the  national  language  were  included.  Only  47  %  of  the  articles  carried an acknowledgement statement followed by  case  reports  (40  %)  and  reviews  (31  %).  It  was  concluded that the concept of intellectual indebtedness  did  not  only  differ  from  one  geographical  context  to  another,  but  also  from  one  academic  genre  to  another.  
Rattan8  analysed acknowledgements appearing  in  research  articles  and  short  communications  in  Annals of Library and Information Studies  covering  the  period  1999-2012.  Acknowledgements  were  analysed  into  moral  support,  technical  support,  access  to  facilities,  financial  support  and  Peer  Interactive Communication type.  The most common  type of acknowledgements related to Peer Interactive  Communication,  which  was  almost  1/3rd  of  total  number  of  acknowledgements. 
Koley  &  Sen17   studied  acknowledgements  incorporated  in  research  papers  on  electronics  and related fields during period 2008-2012 in IETE  
266 
Technical  Review  and   IETE  Journal  of  Research .  Results showed that nearly 35 % of papers contained  acknowledgements;  on  an  average  there  were  2.2  acknowledgements  per  article  and  most  of  the  acknowledgements related to financial support. The  number  of  articles  with  acknowledgements  was  higher  in  IETE  Technical  Review   as  compared  to  IETE  Journal  of  Research. 
3.   o bjectIves 
The purpose of the present study is to examine the  generic structure of acknowledgements appearing in  DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information Technology (DJLIT)  in  order  to  find  out  frequency  distribution  of  acknowledgements,  types,  acknowledgements  per  article  and  so  on.  
4.   c orPus,  Methods And LIMItAtIons 
  Each  article  of  each  issue  of  the  volumes  of  DJLIT covering the period 1998-2013 is downloaded  from  the  web  page  of  this  journal.  This  journal  is  available in print as well as e-form18. Each issue is  examined to identify all research articles and short  communications to find out the acknowledgements.  Acknowledgements  are  generally  found  in  clearly  identifiable  article-ending  section  and  usually  labelled  as  Acknowledgements.  The  text  of  the  acknowledgements  is  scrutinised  and  classified  using  8  part  topology11,7,17   as:  
(a) Access  Support    
Proving access to data, infrastructure facilities,  etc. 
(b)  Moral  Support 
Providing moral support; enthusiasm; permission  to publish the manuscript; encouragement; dedication,  etc. 
(c)  Financial  Support 
Providing  recognition  to  funding  bodies,  can  be  in  the  form  of  scholarships,  fellowships,  and  grants. 
(d)  Technical  Support 
Providing help in the use of tools, technologies,   furnishing technical expertise sample preparation, etc. 
(e)  Peer  Interactive  Communication  (PIC)  Support 
Advice and discussion, critical insight, intellectual  guidance, valuable suggestions, assessment on the  study,  etc. 
(f)  Clerical  Support 
Secretarial services, such help in data collection/ entry/management,  etc.

(g)  Editorial/Linguistic  Support 
Editing,  proofreading,  and  translating  the  manuscript. 
(h)  Unclassifiable 
When  it  is  impossible  to  categorise  an  acknowledgement  according  to  any  of  the  above  categories  due  to  inherent  ambiguity,  vagueness  or  lack  of  contextual  clues,  the  acknowledgement  is  classified  under  this  category. 
The  unnamed  entities  are  recorded  and  counted  for  all  types  of  acknowledgements  except  for  peer  interactive  communication  (PIC)  type  of  acknowledgements.  For  PIC,  both  named  and  unnamed  entities  are  recorded  in  order  to  find  the  list  of  individuals  acknowledged  in  PIC  category. 
The limitation of the present study is that it covers  only sixteen years period. only PIC acknowledgements  are elaborated. the PDF of a very few articles are  not  available  in  the  online  version  of  this  journal.  So, the print version of this journal for those articles  has  been  consulted.

5.3  Acknowledgements  by  category  
Table 3 shows the acknowledgements of the journal  under  study  by  categories.  The  highest  number  of  acknowledgements is in the PIC (29.16 %), followed  by  MS  (26.04  %),  UC  (13.55  %)  and  so  on.                                
5.4  PIc  Acknowledgements 
PIC acknowledgements along with total number  of  articles  with  acknowledgements  are  depicted  in  Table 4. Looking closely the year-wise distribution of  PIC acknowledgements, it is found that it is highest  (100 % each) in the years 1998, 1999 2002, 2003,  2008 and 2013. At the same time there are no PIC  acknowledgements  in  the  years  2000,  2001,  2004,  2005  &  2007  and  mean  is  60.87  %.  This  figure  is  much higher than IETE Technical Review  (11 %),  IETE  Journal of Research  (35 %),  Annals  of  Library  and  Information Studies  (50 %),  College  and  Research  Libraries  (46.2 %),  Library Quarterly   (42.6  %),  and  Information  Processing  &  Management   (49.5  %).  But  this  figure  is  low  from  American  Sociological

not so common as only 9.04 % communications  
include  acknowledgements. 
• Average  number  of  acknowledgements  per

•   t he  most  common  type  of  acknowledgement  
is  peer  interactive  communication  category  
accounting 29.16 % of the total acknowledgements.  
The  mean  percentage  of  the  peer  interactive  
communication  acknowledgements  is  60.87  %  
which  is  higher  than  Annals  of  Library  and

and  information  technology  institutions.  So,  it  can  be  deduced  that  the  individuals  from  library  and  information  technology  play  important  role  in  the  growth  of  literature  of  the  journal  under  study.                                                                   
7. FIndIngs And concLusIons 
Acknowledgements  provide  a  valuable  space  to  writers  to  present  themselves  as  thankers  and  indebters having a professional and social identity.  This structure of the writers enable them to express  gratitude as well as display an appropriate scholarly  competence19.  Hence,  it  is  often  advised  to  writers  to  pay  attention  to  the    appropriate  wording  and  staging  of  these  ‘special  textual  constructs’  whose  ‘formation  is  governed  by  conventions  which  are
