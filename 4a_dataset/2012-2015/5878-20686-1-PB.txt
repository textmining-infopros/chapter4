The  presence  of  web  2.0  technologies  virtually  changes  the  dimension  of  the  society  in  terms  of  accessing and using the information. The present paper attempts to identify the communication patterns  in the context of Facebook adopted in the different universities and institutions in Asia. The paper showed  a survey of 100 higher learning institutions based on the QS University Rankings: Asia 2013, regarding  their presence in Facebook. The study reveals that most of the universities and institutions prefer to use  social networking as one of the most effective way of communication. But there is less presence of library  Facebook  page  of  the  respective  universities. Thus,  the  universities  may  have  offcial  facebook  page  both for institute and its library and can embed with website and maintain with adequate information of  
the institute to reach broader groups of users.

1. IntrodUCtIon 
We  are  now  moving  into  the  knowledge-based  society  where  the  value  of  the  information  and  knowledge  is  tremendous.  The  communication  of  knowledge  and  information  is  very  vital  for  the  overall  development  of  the  nation.  Information  is  a  set  of  symbols  that  can  be  transformed  as  a  message  and  recorded  as  signs,  or  transmitted  as  signals. Basically information is a kind of event that  changes  the  state  of  a  dynamic  system  that  will  help to interpret the information1. The  exchange  of  messages or information using different mechanisms  is  called  as  communication.  Proper  information,  effective  channel  and  successful  communication  help  to  make  the  event  most  effective. The  advent  of information and communication technologies has  made  the  communication  more  complex  than  ever  before. The demand for information always remains  the  same  for  the  people  of  different  spheres.  But  now the way through which this information will be  communicated  is  a  serious  concern.  
In  this  changing  scenario,  the  rapid  and  quick  development  in  computers,  electronic  equipments,  and  telecommunications  are  bringing  information  technology  virtually  to  all  aspects  of  our  life  and  work. The organisations surrounding us are greatly  influenced with this new innovation of technologies.  These  organisations  have  started  to  use  these  technologies  to  communicate  with  the  people  as  it  is  quite  easy,  fast,  reliable,  and  less  costly  than  the  previous  techniques. 
The academic institutes also have come forward  to  make  effective  communication  by  using  internet  technologies. Many internet-based technologies are  now available. But among these what technologies  will  be  selected  by  the  authorities  is  an  important  issue.  There  is  need  to  select  proper  means  of  communication  which  will  help  to  meet  the  goal  of  the  organisation.  
The technology has forced us to think the different  way  of  communication.  In  the  present  time,  social  networking  tools  like  MySpace,  Facebook,  Twitter,  Texting,  and  YouTube  have  evolved  as  one  of  the  effective  way  for  personal  interaction.  These  have  become the common methods of communication. It  has also been seen the change in the technology in  formal learning by using laptops, iPhone applications,  etc.  Rapid  and  quick  interactions  and  sharing  can  be possible and can be carried out through internet  technology and the capabilities which facilitate such  interaction termed as social media. Basically, social  media is an internet-based technology which helps  to  promote  interactions  of  its  users.  
In  the  Educational  sector  computer,  internet,  and communication technologies have been greatly  influenced.  Presence  of  a  number  of  web-based  services and applications through web 2.0 technology  in  education  changed  the  scenario  of  the  society.  Blogs, wikis, multimedia objects, podcasting, content  tagging, and online learning object are quite common  features  of  the  present  education  system.  These  technologies  are  now  providing  opportunities  for

the  students  and  scholars  to  share  their  views  or research findings or notifying information over some  common web-based platform. Not only the students  but  also  the  authorities  of  the  different  universities  and  institutes  take  the  advantage  of  web-based  social  networking  technologies  to  make  effective  communication  among  their  existing  students  and  faculties and also make their presence viable to the  other  categories  of  the  students  who  wish  to  take  admission in that university or institute. Therefore, the  social networking sites appear as one of components  for  the  communication  in  education  environment.  
Among all the available social networking sites  Facebook appears as one of the most popular sites  for  the  common  people.  Facebook  was  launched  during  the  2004  as  a  harvard-only  social  network  site,  but  gradually  it  expanded  and  attracted  great  numbers of registered users in a short time.  Facebook  can be defined as ‘a social utility that helps people  share information and communicate more efficiently  with  their  friends,  family,  and  coworkers’.

The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
• Find  out  the  existence  of  the  Facebook  pages  
of  the    institution  of  higher  learning  in Asia • Identify  the  richness  of  the  Facebook  pages  
to which they belong. This participation in Facebook  enables  users  to  gain  emotional  resources  and  information support, thus facilitating their psychological,  social,  and  economic  well-being,  by,  for  example,  reducing emotional disturbances associated with the  geographical  separation  of  close  friends. 
Mack4, et al . presented the research findings by  comparing the number of reference inquiries received  through Facebook, e-mail, phone, instant messaging,  and traditional person-to-person questions, outside of  normal reference desk shifts. They found that Facebook  is  the  most  effective  media  for  asking  questions. 
Charnigo  &  Barnett-Ellis5   conducted  a  survey  of  academic  librarians  to  judge  their  awareness,  attitude  and  impact  of  the  Facebook  to  their  life  and work. Findings suggest various effects of library  workings  and  also  the  awareness  of  the  librarians  about Facebook phenomenon. Enthusiastic librarians  suggest  to  use  Facebook  for  promoting  library  services  and  events.  Few  librarians  report  non- interested  because  of  the  use  of  Facebook  in  the  library. Majority of the librarians think that Facebook  is  beyond  the  scope  of  professional  librarianship. 
hendrix6, et  al .  explored  the  use  of  Facebook  in  academic  health  science  libraries  mentioning  that a small number of libraries use Facebook. It is  found  that  these  libraries  use  Facebook  mainly  for  
through  the  photos  and  videos  shared  by  the   
marketing the library services and announcements.

Jones & Soltren2  examined the way of Facebook  permits to reveal more information of the users and  mentioning the need for appropriate measures to protect  users from getting their information harnessed by the  other people. They recommended need of few changes  to  increase  the  privacy  of  its  users  in  Facebook.

libraries  use  the  information  section  and  the  wall  properly. But there was a difference in regard to the  use of other Facebook sections. Public libraries use  the  wall  and  the  photos  section  for  disseminating  information  more  than  academic  libraries.  Finding  also shows that both types of libraries use Facebook  for disseminating information to users but not as a  stage  for  discussion. 
hussain9, et al . conducted a survey to examine  the  academic  use  of  social  media  by  university  students  and  to  identify  the  problems  of  university  students  in  using  social  media.  The  study  reveals  that 90 % of the social media users use Facebook. The  common  problems  are  lack  of  bandwidth  and

Aharony10  examined the pattern Facebook uses  among  the  Library  and  Information  Science  (LIS)  students’ in regard to their personality characteristics  and  by  their  perceptions.  The  study  reveals  that  personality characteristics, gender, level of education  and  age  influence  both  patterns  of  Facebook  use  and  their  perceptions  about  Facebook. 
Abdelraheem11   investigates  the  use  of  social  networks  sites  (SNSs)  and  its  relation  to  gender,  type  of  use,  gPA  (grade  point  average),  type  of  mobile  phones,  and  types  of  sites  among  the  students.  The  findings  shows  that  students  prefer  to use SNSs for social matters more rather than for  academic purposes and there was no difference in  using social networks sites between female students  and male students. Findings also suggest students  with  smart  mobile  phones  use  SNSs  more  than  those with normal mobiles and Facebook becomes  the  most  used  site.

QS University Ranking  is one of the most well  accepted ranking systems of the academic institution  throughout the world. Each year they publish a set  of  ranking  based  on  the  certain  indicators.  This  ranking  system  is  brought  out  by  International  English  Language  Testing  System  (IELTS)  of  QS  Intelligence  Unit.  This  year  the  2013  edition  of  QS  Ranking:  Asia,  to  track  the  higher  performing  institutions  is  brought  out.  Based  on  the  nine  key  indicators,  it  listed  Asia’s  top  300  universities  or  higher  learning  institutes. 
In  this  study  QS  Ranking12   is  chosen  as  the  standard  list  of  the  universities  in  Asia.  For  the  purpose  of  the  study  first  100  institutes  selected  for the study. The first 100 institutes or universities  were  chosen  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  highly  rank  institutes  were  advanced  in  using  the  social networking technologies. The study had been  undertaken  to  find  out  the  presence  of  Facebook  among  the  universities  and  institutes  of  the  Asia.  Different research methodologies adopted to complete  the  study.  The  present  study  consisted  of  different  research  methods  like  literature  review,  content  analysis  and  online  survey.  
Initially the institutes’ website was visited to identify  the  existence  of  Facebook  or  related  information.  Then  particular  Facebook  pages  were  visited  to  gather  required  information  if  the  information  was  available.  Then  the  details  information  have  been  collected based on the predefine data sheets prepared  based  on  the  literature  review.  In  case  of  the  non-availability  of  the  information  in  the  institutes’  website, the google searches had been done using  the Boolean operators. After collection of information  the  respective  information  put  into  the  pre-defined  data sheets prepared in MS-Excel. Different kinds of

advanced filtering mechanisms were used to retrieve  the appropriate and required information. Based on  the data sheets in Excel different kinds of tables had  been  prepared  considering  different  parameters.

5.1   d etails  of  Facebook pages  of  Universities/ 
Institutes 
Table  1  shows  the  distribution  of  the  details  of  the Facebook pages of the universities/institutes in  Asia.  It  was  observed  that:  
• Most  of  the  universities  (79  %)  maintained  the  
Facebook  page. 
• The  number  of  people  associated  with  the  
Facebook page in regard to ‘Likes’ (5,52,035) and  
‘talking’  (32,655)  were  quite  greater  in  number  
which indicated the increased interest of the user  
to  communicate  over  the  Facebook  page. • There were Facebook pages where a minimum  
number of ‘likes’ and number of people ‘talking’  
or  almost  no  number  of  people  talking  were  
there.  Thus  it  indicated  the  poor  maintenance  
of  the  Facebook  page  by  the  authority. 
• 78 % Facebook pages have institute’s pictures  
and  19  %  Facebook  pages  have  the  videos  
related  to  the  universities.  The  availability  of  
adequate  photos  and  videos  in  the  Facebook  
page  enriched  the  page,  and 
• The  amount  of  information  available  in  the  
Facebook page was decided here on the basis of  
the numbers of posts available in the timeline of  
the page. Based on the frequency of the posting  
amount  of  information  was  categorised  into  
‘huge’, ‘Very good’, ‘good’, ‘Moderate’, ‘Less’,  
‘Least’, and ‘No Information’. If the posting was  
on regular basis from starting then considered it  
huge but if it was 20-25 postings in few months  
then  very  good  and  for  20-15  postings  it  was  
good  and  for  10  postings  it  was  moderate.  
If  the  posting  was  not  regular  frequency  and  
only  available  5  postings  in  few  months  then  
it  was  less  if  the  posting  was  few  throughout  
the  year  then  it  was  least  and  in  case  only  
initial  few  or  no  posting  it  was  no  information.  
It was found that only 49 (62 %) pages provide  
huge,  very  good  or  good  information  whereas  
30  (38  %)  pages  provide  moderate,  less,  least  
or  no  information.

Table  2  shows  the  distribution  of  country-wise  existence  of  the  Facebook  pages  in  Asia.  It  was  observed  that  79  universities/institutes  had  the  presence  in  the  Facebook.  Only  the  universities/ institutes (21) of few small countries didnot have the

observed that there was a steady progress in regard  to the development of the Facebook page. The year  2010 had become most productive in respect to the  Facebook page development. But the progress has  not  become  so  steady  in  the  year  2013. 5.4 Appearance  of  Facebook  pages  in  
University/institutes

7. ConCLUSIonS 
There have been greater uses of the Facebook  for official communication found now-a-days. But the  maintenance and use of this channel is not that much  adequate.  In  many  cases,  the  available  Facebook  pages  has  not  been  used  properly.  The  advanced  countries  in  Asia  made  rapid  progress  in  case  of  institutes’ communication through Facebook. But there  is a need to expand this option in the other parts of  the  Asia.  With  the  passage  of  time,  it  is  expected  that  Facebook  will  emerge  as  one  of  the  important  way for quick communication among the educational  institutes and its users and also all the universities/ institutes  in Asia  must  have  the  Facebook  account  for the most effective communication. Therefore the  Facebook page page should be administered by some  responsible persons and regular update, maintenance  and  reply  to  the  different  posts  must  be  given.

and  relevant  videos  of  the  institutes. 
The  universities  of  Taiwan,  India,  Hong  Kong,  Malaysia,  Thailand,  Singapore,  Indonesia,  and  Philippine  may  take  proper  initiatives  to  make  their  institutes  visible  in  social  space  and  act  as one way of communication by opening their  Facebook  page.
