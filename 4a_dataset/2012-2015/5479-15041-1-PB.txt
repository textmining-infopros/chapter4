Over the decades, there has been a remarkable transformation in the information globe. Everyone  has to adapt to these changes. Changes in society and demands for information utilisation have forced  the  information  professionals  to  look  for  more  effective  and  effcient  methods  for  processing,  storing,  and retrieving information to cope up with the application of modern information technology. This paper  highlights  knowledge  of  information  communication  technology  (ICT)  in  engineering  institutional  library  and  information  science  (LIS)  professionals  working  engineering  institutions  of  Rayalaseema  region  of  
Andhra Pradesh. 
Keywords: LIS professionals, information communication technology (ICT), skills 
1. INTrODUCTION 
The recent development in science and technology1 has  led  to  a  new  startling  condition  concerning  information  created  in  the  world.  In  the  present  ICT  era,  it  becomes  necessary  for  the  librarians  to  use  the  computers  and  other  devices  in  the  day-to-day  work.  In  this  context,  the  librarians  shall  possess,  in  addition  to  the  academic  and  professional  qualifications,  certain  ICT  skills,  such  as dexterity in operating systems, use of application  software  packages,  knowledge  of  databases  and  programming,  acquaintance  in  webpage  design,  library  automation  software,  technical  skills,  and  managerial  skills.  This  survey  has  been  aimed   to  estimate  the  level  of  knowledge  on  ICT  skills  by  the  respondent  librarians.  This  paper  analyses  various  ICT  skills  possessed  by  LIS  professionals  like  programming  languages,  application  software  packages, Database management system (DBMS),  library management software an d web design and  also  finds  out  the  constraints  encountered  by  LIS  professionals  in  acquiring  ICT  skills. 
2. LITErATUrE rEVIEW 
According to Arokyamary2, information communication  technology  (ICT)  facilitates  access  to  electronic  information that has become invaluable and complementing  traditional  library  services. The  authors  discuss  on  mapping  the  existing  ICT  skills  and  competencies  of the LIS professionals working in the Engineering  colleges  of  Karnataka  and  thus  comes  out  with  suggestions in bridging the gap by stating the required  knowledge,  skills  and  competencies  that  has  not  only  brought  a  change  in  the  working  style  of  LIS  professionals but also essential for them to survive  
and  flourish  in  this  digital  era.  Satpathy3   presents  a  case  study  of  the  ICT  skills  of  professionals  trained  in  library  and  information  sciences  (LIS)  at  engineering  colleges  in  Orissa,  India. The  study  aims  to  identify  the  ICT  skills  possessed  by  LIS  professionals as well as the application of these skills  and the challenges faced by LIS professionals. The  study found that many of the librarians interviewed  possessed  a  Master’s  degree  in  LIS  and  were  computer literate, and recommended that engineering  institutes update the infrastructural facilities of their  libraries in order to use the ICT skills of LIS-trained  employees. Atulomah4  discusses about the attitudes  and knowledge of academic librarians in Southwest  Nigeria  concerning  Library  2.0.  The  benefits  of  and  barriers  to  installing  ICT  in  Nigerian  university  libraries are discussed. Demographic and attitudinal  variables of the respondents are noted. Discussions  include the Nigerian Library Association’s continuing  efforts  to  gain  global  recognition,  mentoring  and  training of young librarians by senior librarians, and  solving  the  country’s  energy  problem. 
3.  ObJECTIVES 
The  objectives  of  this  study  are  to: 
• Analyse the knowledge of ICT of LIS professionals  
in Engineering instituions in Rayalaseema Region  
of Andhra  Pradesh. 
• Classify the librarians by age, sex, qualification  
and  experience  depending  on  the  types  of  
institutions  they  serve.

4. METHODOLOGY 
The  respondents  from  the  questionnaire  were  drawn from three types of Engineering5  Institutions  (government, Minority and Private) in the Rayalaseema  Region  of  Andhra  Pradesh.  Population  sampling  technique  was  adopted  for  data  collection.  This  survey  has  considered  92  institutions,  which  were  established before 2010, and a structured questionnaire  was  framed.  Out  of  92  questionnaires  distributed  only 81 have responded, Table 1 presents the data  pertaining  to  the  distribution  of  questionnaires  and  the  responses  received. 
A  majority  (72)  of  the  respondents  belong  to  Private Engineering Institutions.  About 3 response  belongs to Private Minority Engineering Institutions  and  only  6  belong  to  government  Institution.  
5. WEIGHTED  Ar ITHMETIC   M EAN 
This  paper  uses  wAM-weighted  Arithmetic  Mean6 methodology for analysing the data that was  introduced by Cotes, Roger. The weighted arithmetic  mean  used  in  statistical  analysis  of  grouped  data:  each  number  xi  is  the  midpoint  of  an  interval,  and  each  corresponding  value  of  wi  is  the  number  of  data  points  within  that  interval.  For  a  given  set  of  data,  many  possible  means  can  be  defined,  depending  on  which  features  of  the  data  are  of  interest. weighted arithmetic mean is computed by  using  the  following  formula: 
Xw =

(Component Score Coefficient Matrix). Factor analysis  attempts to bring inter co-related variables together  under  more  general  underlying  variables.  More  specifically, the goal of factor analysis7  is to explain  the  variance  in  the  observed  variables  in  terms  of  principal  latent  factors.  
6.  DATA  ANALYSIS  AND  INTErPrETATION  
6.1  Profile  of  Library  and  Information  Science  
Professionals 
Figure 1 represents the gender of the librarians  with respect to the types of the institutions they serve.  It  is  found  that  majorities  (81.48  %)  of  librarians  belong to male community and only 8.52 % belong  to the female population. In other words, there are  no  female  librarians  in  government  institutions.  generally,  the  LIS  professionals  are  dominated  by  the  feminine  gender  in  the western  and  European  countries. however, it is observed in the study that  the numbers of female librarians are incredibly low,  contrary  to  the  expected  situation.  
6.2  Types  of  Institutions  Vs Age  of  Librarians 
Table 1 presents the classification of the librarians  by age and type of the institutions.  It is found that  about more than three-fourth of the sample (62 out  of  81)  belong  to  less  than  40  years.  This  shows  that  they  are  all  young  librarians  possessing  skills  and  zeal  to  work  with  creativity.    
6.3  Types  of  Institutions  Vs  Qualification  of  
Librarians 
Table 2 reveals the qualification (academic and  professional)  of  the  librarians  under  survey.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  all  librarians  are  qualified  with  a  Master’s  degree  in  LIS  (MLIS)  and  nearly  two-thirds  (49.38  %)  possess  MPhil  degree  and  8  with  PhD  degree  in  LIS.

Table  3  presents  the  information  pertaining  to  the  experience  of  the  librarians  and  types  of  institution.  Nearly  half  of  the  sample  librarians  39  have experience ranging below 5 years. More than  one  third  of  the  samples  22  falls  below  11  and  above  5  years  of  experience.  It  is  observed  that  the  greater  the  number  of  librarians,  smaller  the  duration  of  the  service.

Based  on  the  component  score  coefficient  matrix  for  various  solutions, three-factor models were chosen, such that  the  variables  did  not  overlap  on  any  other  factor.   These three-factors of skills for librarian assessment  were named as Excellent (Factor 1), good (Factor 2)  and  Satisfactory  (Factor  3)  respectively.  Table  15

loadings on their expected factors, and three factors  had  loads  of  0.10  or  higher  than  any  of  the  other  factors.  The  robustness  of  the  original  solution  seem quite surprising, given that these scales were  developed  from  the  responses  of  a  sample  in  one  community of one region (restricted to Rayalaseema  Region  in  Andhra  Pradesh).  The  factor  loadings  were  examined  to  identify  those  items  that  met  for  factor-purity  in  the  present  sample.  Loadings  negatively correlate with good study results. Loadings  of 0.10 or higher are highlighted which indicate that  librarians  lack  skill  in  the  respective  item.  On  the  whole,  Table  16  provides  information  on  the  skills  lacked  by    librarians.

The greater part of librarians possess excellent  knowledge  in  .Net  (8.33  %)  when  compared  to  other  programming  languages. 
Knowledge of application software packages such  as MS-word, MS-Excel and MS-PowerPoint by  LIS  professionals  is  reasonably  encouraging. A  good  number  of  LIS  professionals  possess  knowledge in DBMS such as Oracle and SQL/ MySQL. 
Most  of  the  librarians  (49.78  %)  express  a  satisfactory level of knowledge in library management  software.

6.17  Constraints  on  ICT  Practice  by  LIS  
  Professionals 
From  Table  17,  it  is  observed  that  lack  of  commitment  by  institutional  management  give  the  impression  of  being  a  significant  constraint  for  librarians  to  apply  ICT  Skills  (70.4  %)  followed  by  the  lack  of  updated  ICT  infrastructural  facility  in  their library (44.4 %), and high cost of ICT facilities/ components  (42  %).  
7.  FINDINGS 
• The  majority  of  the  librarians  are  men  
(81.48  %)  and  only  18.52  %  are  women. • About  three  fourth  of  the  respondents  are  less  
than 40 years of age which show they are quite   
young  exhibiting  ability  to  work  ardently. 
• With  regard  to  operating  systems,  librarians’  
possess  awareness  on windows  (20.4  %)  and  
uNIX  (8.4  %).

The knowledge of other online utilities and services  such  as  E-mail,  online  LIS  group,  network,  blogs,  forums  are  practically  optimistic.      Librarians  lack  better  knowledge  in  technical  skills such as optical character recognition and  imaging  technology. 
The main constraints faced by professionals in  acquiring ICT skills are the poor infrastructural facilities  and  lack  of  cooperation  from  management.    
8.  SUGGESTIONS 
Some suggestions are made below for upgrading  
ICT  skills  of  LIS  professionals. 
• The library management needs to provide necessary  
scope and encouragement to promote the ICT  
skills  of  LIS  Professionals. 
• LIS Professionals have to be encouraged to attend  
seminars, workshops, ICT enhanced training program  
and  Innovative  ICT’s  performance  skills.

Educational universities offering courses in LIS  need  to  change  their  syllabus  focusing  more  on  ICT’s  and  providing  practical  classes  to  expertise  in  ICT  Skills. 
The  engineering  educational  institutions  of  
Rayalaseema  Region  require  building  up  the

infrastructural  amenities  of  libraries,  so  that  ICT  skills  of  LIS  professionals  can  be  better  utilised.

CONCLUSIONS 
Information and communication technology(ICT)  influences  the  role  of  LIS  professionals  and  the  offer  number  of  opportunities  for  professionals  and  personal  development.  Professionals  with  appropriate  ICT  skills  are  crucial  for  transforming  traditional library to the electronic library. The present  survey  reveals  that  the  LIS  professionals  serving  in  various  engineering  educational  institutions  of  the  Rayalaseema  Region  of  Andhra  Pradesh  are  mostly computer literate and have significant basic  ICT skills to handle the library, still there is enough  scope  to  develop  their  innovative  ICT  skills  and  to  implement these skills in the library to provide new  ICT-based  library  services.
