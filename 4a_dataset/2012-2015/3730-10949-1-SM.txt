1. INTRODUCTION 
Scientific discoveries and inventions could be  of value to mankind. Research leads to invention,  and is carried out for acquiring new knowledge,  improvement of existing knowledge, to provide  solutions to specific problems and to improve  processes and practices. Since research findings  are of significance and value for the society, research  has attained an important place in all the fields of  knowledge. In other words research provides solutions  to specific problems and improves processes and  practices1. In recent decades science and engineering  research has become an international endeavour.  More than ever, the governments around the world  acknowledge the role of science and technology (S&T)  in generating new jobs, economic prosperity, response  to national issues and global challenges, and global  competitiveness2. As a result, the enormous increase  in research activities producing large number of  doctoral theses has contributed for the growth and  development of existing subject areas, emergence  of new fields of knowledge and subfields within a

short span of time and these emerging fields are  becoming very important disciplines of study. The  engineering and allied branches of engineering are  fast growing and new areas of study within the field  are emerging faster than ever before. Recently a  number of technological universities have emerged  for sustainable and substantial development of  technical education in India. 
Universities are centres of higher learning and  serve as training grounds for research scholars by  providing basic research methodology in specialised  fields. The success of their research depends upon  the training they acquire in the universities. Being  the centres of research, universities are considered  to play a vital role in the scientific progress of a  nation. During the recent past, good numbers of  research activities have been carried out in the  universities and research institutions in various parts  of the world. In India, due to the establishment of  University Grants Commission (UGC) and other  similar bodies and their active support, many students  are carrying out MPhil and PhD degrees. During

pre-independence, there were very few doctoral  degrees holders, but after independence the research  output increased drastically in every field. In India,  about 125 universities and research institutions are  offering PhD programmes3.  
2. BRIEF PROFILE OF VTU  
The Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU)  has been established by the Government of the  Karnataka to promote planned and sustainable  development of technical education consistent with  state and national policies. The VTU is one of the  leading technological university in India, having  around 200 colleges affiliated to it which offer,  under graduate (UG) courses in 28 disciplines  and post graduate (PG) programmes in around 80  disciplines. The intake at UG level is about 67100  and about 12666 at the PG level. The University has  13 Quality Improvement Programme (QIP) Centres  in various affiliated colleges and 16 extension  centres offering PG programmes. There are over  350 departments recognised as research Centres  in various affiliated colleges. At present over 1800  students/faculty have registered for PhD degree and  over 180 students have registered for MSc (Engg.  by Research) for the academic year 2010 -2011.  The University has awarded PhD degree to about  120 candidates and MSc (Engg.) degree to about 7  candidates. The University has initiated MBA, MCA  and MTech programmes at ‘Jnana Sangama’, Belgaum  with more than 500 students. VTU has a vision to  become an outstanding technological university at  the cutting edge of science and technology that  produces world class knowledge-delivery, research,  extension and leadership in technology innovation  useful for Industry and Society. Its mission to  plan the development of technical education, to  establish value-based and need-based education  and training in engineering and technology, with a  view to generate qualified and competent manpower,  responsive to technological and societal needs4. The  VTU has an exclusive research portal; it has been  designed to provide information such as, finding  the faculty working in a specific area of research  and list of research students, etc.  The portal helps  the research scholars and students get access to  all necessary information.  The students can also  get access to university announcement on financial  support for various research schemes. The portal  contains the abstracts of research topics of all  the research scholars. Many new features such  as 'Refereed Journal Publications’, outstanding  accomplishment of research scholars and their  innovations have been planned to figure on the  portal in the coming days5. 
3. RELATED STUDIES 
Indian universities play a major role in creation and  dissemination of knowledge by providing opportunities  
56 
for research scholars to conduct research studies and  to bring out doctoral dissertations as a unique genre  of information resource. It is observed that every  year, a significant number of doctoral dissertations  are being produced by these universities in India6.  Prathap and Gupta7  examined the ranking of Indian  universities for their research output and quality using  a new performance index for a ranking of research  performance based on quantum of output and quality  of research of various Indian universities. A total of  25 universities with high output of publications during  a 10-year period from 1999 to 2008 were identified,  using data from SCOPUS8. Indian Statistical Data  Provider9  a leading statistical data provider on India  as macro and micro economy, reports that “As on  March 2008, there are 382 universities promoting  higher education in India”. Of 382, 233 are state,  25 are central and 126 are deemed universities.  These universities offer postgraduate courses and  doctoral research programmes in various disciplines.  They also undertake research projects of national  importance sponsored by government and other  agencies. The doctoral researches are represented  through the doctoral dissertations submitted to  universities for the award of doctoral degree. A  study of such doctoral dissertations indicates the  direction of research in India.  
A study on library and information science  research in India was carried by Chandrashekara  and Ramasesh3. They clearly projected with relevant  statistical tables the output of doctoral research in  India. And also attempt has been made to depict  quantity of research output in the form of doctoral  theses, state wise, university-wise, topic-wise and  supervisor-wise. Further they indicated the areas of  research activity in LIS with ranking of universities  and states which have contributed comparatively  more to the field of LIS research in India. Similarly,  another study carried by Singh10  reported that 2,461  doctoral degrees were awarded by Indian universities  in 1970-71 and by 1981-82, it had risen to 6,404. Ten  years later, the number had gone up to 8,743 and  the figure touched 11,534 doctoral dissertations during  the next decade. The University Grants Commission,  New Delhi11  in its 2005-06 Annual Report (2008,  p168) states that the total number of PhD degrees  awarded during 2003-04 and 2004-05 was 17,853  and 17,898 respectively.  The analysis of doctoral  dissertations awarded by Bangalore University12  was carried out on the growth and development of  research activities of past 4½ decades. There are  1497 doctoral degrees awarded from 1963 to 2005,  in 38 domains. The study reveals that an average  34 doctoral theses were awarded and from 1990 to  2002 and the research output traced significance  with 1002 (66.93 %) doctoral theses being awarded.  Maximum research was carried out in Zoology (149,  9.95 %) and Botany (133, 8.88 %) departments.

It is observed that 737 research supervisors are  engaged in guiding doctoral students.  
4. OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of this study is to understand  the growth and development of research activities  in VTU in the past 13 years. The specific objectives  are:  
•  To know the growth of the research productivity  
in Visvesvaraya Technological University •  To understand the contribution by research  
supervisors towards their research interest •  To identify the most predominant domain area  
in the VTU 
•  To find out the top ranking of research  
guides 
5. METHODOLOGY 
The data for the present study has been collected  from the two sources. (a) data published in the  University News: a weekly journal from the Association  of Indian Universities and (b) the VTU website4.  The data obtained from the above two sources  were recorded separately and a master spreadsheet  containing 250 unique records was created with  careful examination to exclude duplicate records.  This spreadsheet served as primary data input for  analysis and interpretation. Origin statistical software  package was used for data analysis. Frequency  distribution and cross tables were generated by  using the package. 
6. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION 
There are 250 doctoral degrees awarded so  far in 8 domains. The authors have made an  attempt to consolidate all the doctoral degrees  awarded by VTU, Belgaum, in Karnataka. The data  were analysed and presented under 9 heads, viz.,

chronological distribution of doctoral dissertations,  Domain-wise distribution of doctoral dissertations,  Frequency-wise distribution of doctoral dissertations,  rank-wise distribution of doctoral dissertations,  productivity of research supervisors, rank-wise  distribution of research supervisors, productivity of  second research supervisors, rank-wise distribution  of second supervisors, and rank-wise distribution  of research centers according to their research  output. 
6.1 Chronological Distribution of Doctoral  
Dissertations 
Figure 1 indicates that, there has been substantial  progress in terms of research output from VTU.  The number of doctoral degrees awarded from the  VTU from 2007 to 2011. It is clear from the Fig.  1 that research activities were quite low till 2009  and then increased from 2010. This was due to the  need and emphasis on recruiting qualified faculty  mainly in the universities and constituent/affiliated  institutions. It was also true that University Grants  Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical  Education (AICTE)13  started giving preference to the  candidates who have done research in the respective  domain. The present situation is that on an average  50 doctoral theses are being awarded every year.  During 2007-2009 an average of 31 theses were  awarded the doctoral degrees. From the 2010-2011  the research output reached a significant high value  of 156 (62.40 %) doctoral theses. 
6.2 Domain-wise Distribution of Doctoral  
Dissertations 
Table 1 shows domain-wise productivity of  doctoral dissertations. Total 250 doctoral degrees  were awarded in engineering, of which 101 (40.40  %) were in mechanical engineering and 45 (18.00  %) in electrical and electronics engineering doctoral  degrees were awarded. Similarly in civil engineering  36 (14.40 %) doctoral degrees were awarded and in

computer science engineering 24 (9.60 %), however  in applied science (21, 8.40 %) comparatively more  than electronics & communication engineering (12,  4.80 %). The technology and management science  doctoral degrees were least with 8 (3.20 %) and 3  (1.20 %) respectively.  
6.3 Frequency-wise Distribution of Doctoral  
Dissertations 
Table 2 reveals that maximum research was  carried out in 2011. Out of a total of 99 theses,  33 were awarded in mechanical engineering, 19  in electrical and electronics engineering, and 18  in civil engineering. In 2010, out of 57, 26 were  in mechanical, 10 in civil, 7 in applied sciences,  6 in electrical and computer, 1 each in electronics  and technology. In 2008, out of 47, 20 degrees  were awarded in mechanical, 9 in electrical, 6 in  computer, 5 in civil, 4 and 3 in applied sciences  and technology respectively. In 2009, out of 39, 18  in mechanical, 7 in electrical, 5 in applied sciences,  4 in computer, only 2 in technology. The least  research activities were found in 2007, i.e., out of  8 awarded degrees, 4 were in mechanical and 4  were in electrical. This clearly shows that research  
Table 2. Frequency wise distribution of doctoral dissertations 
being carried out at VTU has advanced with an  upward trend yearly in these eight fields.  6.4 Rank-wise Distribution of Doctoral  
Dissertations 
Figure 2 projects the rank-wise distribution of  doctoral dissertations from the VTU. Mechanical  engineering department stands with first rank (101,  40.40 %) among the other departments on the  awarded doctoral degrees.  Electrical and electronics  engineering department stands second with 45 (18.00  %) theses being awarded doctoral degrees. Third  place goes to civil engineering (36, 14.40 %) and  computer science engineering (24, 9.60 %) in fourth  place. Next stands applied sciences with 21 (8.40  %) and 8 (3.20 %) technology doctoral degrees  being awarded. In electronics and communication  engineering 12 (4.80 %) and management sciences  3 (1.20 %) doctoral degrees were awarded from the  VTU which stands in 7th and 8th rank respectively.  This clearly indicates that rank-wise research output  from VTU in mechanical engineering is considerably  more. 
6.5 Productivity of Research Supervisors  
Research supervisors play an important role in  the productivity of research outputs by individual  departments. The seriousness of research scholar,  proper guidance from supervisor and the infrastructural  facilities provided by universities play an important  role in the productivity of research output. Figure 3  illustrates the output of research supervisors. 
It was observed that about 169 research supervisors  were engaged in guiding doctoral students at VTU.  The figures indicate that more than half of research  supervisors (65.68 %) have produced one doctoral  degree. Another 23.08 percent have produced  two research degrees. Similarly 8.88 per cent of  supervisors guided 15 doctoral students. Only 2.37  per cent of the guides supervised up to 4 students.  It clearly shows that comparatively single-guided  research output are more in VTU and its affiliated  research centres.

6.6 Rank-wise Distribution of Research  
Supervisors 
Table 3 reveals that, the guide-wise output of  doctoral theses. Prof. C.S. Ramesh, Prof P.G. Tewari,  Prof. P.S. Satynarayana and Prof. V. Krishnan have  successfully guided for 4 doctoral degrees in the  domain of mechanical and electrical engineering.  Prof. H.K. Shivanand, Prof. Joel-Hemanth, Prof. K.  Radhakrishna, Prof. K.V.A. Balaji, Prof. M.S. Murali,  Prof. M.S. Prabhuswamy, Prof. R. Chandrashekar  and Prof. S.M. Shashidhara are in the second  place by guiding 3 doctoral theses in the domain  of mechanical. Similarly Prof. K.S. Lokesh & Prof.  K.B. Prakash from civil engineering department  have guided and supervised 3 doctoral theses.  However Prof. K.R. Ananda Kumar & Prof. M.G.  Venkateshmurthy guided 3 doctoral students successfully  in the computer science engineering. It was also  observed that the top nineteen faculty guides are  from the different departments of affiliated colleges  
of VTU, i.e. mechanical, electrical, civil, computer  science, applied sciences and electronics. This  clearly indicates that research guides from VTU are  more involved in carrying out research programmes  with their research scholars and hence the output  is also considerably more. 
6.7 Productivity of Co-guides 
It can be observed from the Fig. 4 that about 52  second research supervisors are engaged in guiding  doctoral students at VTU. Table 3 indicate that  majority (90.38 %) of second research supervisors  have produced one doctoral student. Another 7.69  percent have produced two doctoral degrees. Only  1.92 per cent of them have guided up to 3 doctoral  students.  
6.8 Rank-wise Distribution of Co-guides 
Table 4 shows the rank-wise distribution of co-guide  supervised doctoral theses. Prof. K. Ramakrishnan  has successfully guided 3 doctoral degrees in the  domain of Applied sciences. Prof. B.G. Pujar and  Prof. N.K.S. Rajan are in the second place with 2  doctoral theses each. Similarly, 2 doctoral theses  each guided by Prof. R. Sathyamurthy and Prof.  S. Sreedhara. They have supervised in the domain  of civil and mechanical engineering. This clearly  indicates that research co-guides from different  departments are more involved in carrying out research  programmes with their research scholars. 6.9 Rank-wise distribution of research centres  
Table 5 reveals the rank-wise distribution of  VTU affiliated college wise distribution of doctoral  degrees in engineering and technology. Out of  total 250 doctoral degrees, the highest number,  i.e., 29 (11.60 %) has been contributed by Sri  Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysore  stands first. B.M.S. College of Engineering, Bangalore  comes next with 20 (8.00 %), and M.S. Ramaiah  Institute of Technology, Bangalore stands in third  position with 19 (7.60 %) contribution. It is followed  by Malnad College of Engineering, Hassan, with 18  (7.20 %) degrees contribution. Similarly, Basaveshwar  Engineering College, Bagalkot and Siddaganga  Institute of Technology, Tumkur stand in fifth position  with each 15 (6.00 %) degrees. This is followed  by other research centres which can be observed  from the table. Further the Agricultural University,  Raichur; Central Silk Technological Research Institute,  Bangalore; Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology,  Bangalore, Raman Research Institute, Bangalore  stand in last place with 1 (0.40 %) each doctoral  degree contribution. They stand with 15th rank  among the research centre of VTU. 
7. CONCLUSION 
This study emphasises the perspective of the  research activities in VTU. So far 250 doctoral degrees  were awarded in the 8 domains, namely mechanical,  civil, electrical, applied sciences, computer science,

MULLA AND KONNUR: MAPPING OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH TREND IN KARNATAKA 
electronics, management sciences, and technology.  The data was analysed and presented under the 9  heads viz. chronological growth, department-wise,  frequency-wise, rank-wise distribution, productivity of  supervisors, and ranking of research guides, etc. The  authors analysed the bibliographic details of doctoral  degrees awarded by VTU during 2007 to 2011. It  has been observed that 169 research supervisors  are engaged in guiding doctoral students. It is  also observed that Prof. C.S. Ramesh, Prof. P.G.  Tewari, Prof. P.S. Satynarayana and Prof V. Krishnan  stand first, having guided 4 doctoral degrees in the  domain of mechanical and electrical engineering. Any  research productivity depends on the contributions  of the researcher and the role of their guide(s) is  highly significant. The present situation is that on an  average 60 doctoral theses are being awarded every  year, whereas in the initial stage of establishment  of the VTU, i.e., in first decade, only 8 degrees  were awarded the degree. However from the year  2010 and 2011 the research output has increased  significantly with 62.40 percent of doctoral theses  being awarded. Maximum research was carried out  in Mechanical (101, 40.40 %) engineering domain  and the highest number i.e., 29 (11.60 %) has been  contributed by Sri Jayachamarajendra College of  Engineering, Mysore, which stands with first rank  among the VTU recognized research centres. The  primary objective of this study was to understand  the growth and development of research activities  in VTU, since its inception (1998). It is clear from  this study that research productivity increased  from the year 2010. This was due to the need and  emphasis on recruiting qualified faculty mainly in  the universities and constituent/affiliated institutions.  It is also true that the research output increased  because UGC and AICTE started giving preference  to the candidates who have done research in their  respective domain. This study leads to new research  activity in the field of library and information science,  i.e., the citation analysis of these large number of  (250) doctoral theses.
