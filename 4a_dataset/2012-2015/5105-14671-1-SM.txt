 Libraries have been putting considerable efforts in the design of information products and services  and  distributing  the  same  effectively  and  effciently.  In  view  of  the  social,  economic,  and  technological  changes,  library  and  information  centers  have  begun  to  realise  that  marketing  of  information  products  and services is an integral part of administration. This paper attempts to work out marketing strategies  for the university libraries in Kerala by analysing the marketing orientation through a user survey.  The  data for the study was collected from a sample of 842 users of the university libraries in Kerala such as  Kerala University Library (KUL), Mahatma Gandhi University Library (MGUL), Cochin University of Science  and Technology Library (CUSATL), and CH Mohammed Koya Library of University of Calicut (CHMKL).   The study found that most of the respondents are willing to pay for information services since they rely  more on the quality of information services than the existing fee services. The preferred pricing policy  is to provide necessary subsidy to the extent of 50 % based on the payment capacity of various user  segments. The survey found that only a few users are aware of existing service offered by the university  libraries and there is need for effective promotional strategies.  The study suggested various strategies  for repositioning the university libraries in Kerala for marketing.

1. INtrODUctION 
Libraries  are  facing  serious  competition  from  commercial information service providers and use of  the  resources  available  from  libraries  and  analyse  and repackage the same for customised use by the  users. Online resources are emerging in a big way  that  will  question  the  role  and  form  of  libraries  in  future1.Thus libraries have been putting considerable  efforts  in  the  design  of  information  products  and  services  and  distributing  the  same  effectively  and  efficiently  in  the  changing  social,  economic  and  technological scenario. The technological revolution  and  escalating  library  costs  are  responsible  for  encouraging  the  library  profession  to  develop  a  professional  marketing  approach  in  its  operations  and services with an effort to develop an appropriate  marketing plan. Marketing planning involves deciding  on marketing strategies that will help the institution  attain  its  overall  strategic  objectives.

of  marketing  tools,  service  promotion  experiences  and  new  techniques  in  a  large  library  context.  He  explored  the  boundaries  between  real  and  virtual  libraries  and  service  provision.  Garusing  Arachchige3   identified  the  role  of  libraries  in  Sri  Lanka for the process of improving lifelong learning  and  strategies  applicable  from  the  e-marketing  concept. Mu4  suggested the strategies for marketing  academic library resources and information services  to  Asian  International  students  and  revealed  that  libraries need to market their services and resources  proactively  to  students  who  were  not  familiar  with  the  services  and  resources  in  a  western  academic  library.  Robinson5   suggested  six  golden  rules  for  marketing information service successfully based on  the personal experience of the author in setting up  a new information service. Liu & Shu6   investigated  library  user’s  needs  and  promotion  strategies  of  electronic resources and identified the most effective  ways of marketing. Shukla & Tripathi7  discussed on  new marketing strategies of information services in  university  libraries  with  a  set  of  principles  in  the  field  of  marketing  strategy.

is  essential  in  university  libraries. 
5.1  Market  Segmentation 
The  clients  of  the  university  libraries  in  Kerala  can be segmented as students (primary), researchers,  teachers,  public,  and  non-teaching  staff.  Degree  holders are numerically the largest group. However,  post-graduate students have very similar information  needs, behaviours, and so many services directed at  the main client group will benefit the smaller market  segment.  Therefore,  marketing  strategies  can  be  directed  at  these  segments.  Academic  community  (research  scholars,  students,  and  teachers)  and  others  have  quite  different  information  needs  for  which  tailored  services  and  marketing  strategies  are  required.  The  segmentation  is  as  follows: (i) Students-  consisting  of  students  of  colleges  
affiliated to the universities in Kerala and university  
teaching  departments. 
(ii) Research  Scholars-  consisting  of  those  doing  
research in the university teaching departments,  
affiliated  colleges  and  centers  recognised  by  
the  universities.

5.2  User behaviour Analysis 
Knowledge of consumer behaviour would render  immense help for planning and implementing marketing  strategies.  The  behaviour  of  the  users,  like  user’s  information requirements, willingness to pay, readiness  to  bear  the  extent  of  cost  of  information  products  and services, etc, are very important in formulating  marketing  strategies. 
5.3  positioning  of  University  Libraries  
Positioning refers to the services rendered by the  library  for  the  various  users.  Each  segment  of  the  users requires separate positioning strategies. Special  communication programmes, special events, special  service, etc, will enhance the position of the library.  A strategic repositioning of libraries should essentially  use  and  focus  on  the  specific  core  competencies

of  university  libraries.  It  is  accomplished  through  market  analysis  to  find  out  the  potential  users  (or  markets) that exist, the groups of customers to serve  (target markets), to identify users needs, to identify  the products and services to meet their needs, etc.  The  analysis  of  the  marketing  mix  elements,  viz.,  place,  product,  promotion,  and  price  shows  that  university  libraries  in  Kerala  are  well  positioned  in  marketing  of  information  services  and  products9.  
6. MArKEtINg  StrAtEgIES 
The initial market strategy of libraries is to identify  the current users and encourage them to avail greater  use of available information services and products.  It has been observed that many users are unaware  of  the  range  of  library  services  offered.  There  are  many  kinds  of  strategies  like  market  segmentation  strategies,  market  development  strategies,  market  penetration  strategies,  and  market  communication  strategy.  for  each  part  of  the  marketing  audit,  specific  strategies  are  developed  by    university  libraries  in  Kerala.  
6.1 promotional  Strategy 
Promotion  is  used  to  communicate  information  about  information  products  and  services  to  target  market audiences, thereby, facilitating the exchange  process  offered  by  the  library  and  information  centres. All types of libraries have employed some  form  of  library  guides,  pamphlets,  accession  lists,  exhibitions, advertising, displays, talks, etc. Promotion  can  build  up  a  strong  image  of  the  library. A  well- planned  promotional  effort  can  stimulate  potential  users to use its products. The promotional activities  like e-mail/bulletin board (except in KUL), computer  network  (except  in  KUL,  MGUL),  ILL  (except  in  CHMK), extension services (except in MGUL, CHMK),  
• personal intimation (except in MGL) and Guide book  and Display/posters (in all) are done. Communicating  what  libraries  do  has  always  been  difficult  and  as  the  remote  use  increases,  the  new  strategies  are  required.  Therefore,  the  strategies  that  can  be  used for marketing communication in the university  libraries  in  Kerala  may  include  the  following: 
• Hosting of website/web portal-Most of the business  
organisations have learned that the websites is  
a  significant  marketing  and  promotional  tool.  
Now, KUL and CUSATL have their own websites  
to  propagate  their  products  and  services  with  
clarity, conciseness, consistent layout, minimum  
graphics,  and  regular  updating.  Use  of  Library  
2.0 technologies such as blogging, RSS feeds,  
social  networking,  etc.,  act  as  catalysts. 
• Conducting regular user orientation programmes  
in all the university libraries in Kerala. KUL has a

Production of brochures and posters-The library  should  prepare  attractive  brochures,  leaflets,  and  posters  that  should  be  distributed  to  all  members. 
Guided library tours for new registered members  as well as those interested in the library services  are  absolutely  essential. 
Print newsletters and house journals containing  information  about  new  resources  and  services  and  to  be  circulated  to  all  users  including  public.  
Articles  in  newspapers  and  journals-articles  published in the daily newspapers and magazines  that  are  likely  to  read  regularly  by  the  actual  and  potential  clients  are  compiled.  
Demonstrations of the products/services at users’  place  or  during  seminars  or  workshops. 
Exhibition-cum-sale of various information products  and services at various conferences and seminars  related  to  users  subjects/areas. 
Personal selling-service points; librarian’s visits  and  e-mail  contacts  with  academic  community  and  staff. 
Out-of-library  posters  about  the  information  products and services, which are appropriately  placed  and  attractive. 
Advertisement in the publications of the parent  body  and  in  other  university  publications. E-mail  lists  or  forums-clients  can  subscribe  to  an  e-mail  list  that  sends  a  personal  e-mail  about library news, ranging from new resources  to  service  outages. 
Direct  mail  can  be  very  effective  with  some  target  audiences. 
Library  should  actively  participate  in  library  listserves, online forums, and video-conferencing  with  other  libraries  or  library  associations.  Online interactive reference service (chat service)  and establishment of information desk in university  libraries in Kerala have to taken up on a priority  basis. 
Celebration of special events like anniversaries of  the university library, birth anniversary of Dr SR  Ranganathan, World book Day, National Library  Week, Open Access Week etc., in collaboration  with  library  schools  and  library  associations. 
6.2 pricing  Strategy 
Price  can  be  defined  as  cost  to  produce  a  product  or  service.  Various  techniques  and  factors  are involved in pricing the information products and  
documentary CD called ‘WINGS’, which explains  services which can vary from segment to segment.    
the various functions, information products and  services. 
Determining  the  actual  costs  involved  in  any  new  product  or  service  is  the  first  step  in  pricing  the 
401

service.  The  cost  of  the  products  or  services  can  be  calculated  as  the  sum  of  staff  costs,  facilities  cost,  packaging  cost,  distribution  cost,  promotion  cost,  equipment  cost,  and  other  cost.    The  pricing  policy  of  the  university  libraries  in  Kerala  may  be  based on the user’s willingness to pay for information  products  and  services.  
6.2.1  Readiness  to  Pay  for  Information  Services 
  Library services have long been considered as  free services that have affected the quality of services.  This has forced authorities to think of extracting at  least a fraction of the cost from the users. Indirectly,  the  efforts  were  to  enhance  the  membership  fee,  annual subscription charges, temporary membership  charges and overdue charges, but this had met some  resistance  and  to  charge  for  the  various  services.  from  the  questionnaire,  it  has  been  assessed  for  the  willingness  to  pay  for  different  types  of  information  services  on  payment  basis  are  printing  frequency  415  (75.3  %),  e-journals  406  (73.7  %),  digital  library  383  (69.5  %),  internet  381  (69.1  %),  CD/DVD-based  373  (67.7  %),  document  scanning  335 (60.8 %), document delivery 308 (55.9 %), ILL  299  (54.3  %),  reprography  295  (53.5  %),  CAS  286  (51.9 %), digital repository and abstracting each 266  (48.3 %), literature search 216 (39.2 %), translation  and networking each 210 (38.1 %), consultancy 201  (36.5  %),  indexing  197  (35.8  %),  bibliography  191  (34.7 %), reference 156 (28.3 %), current contents  154 (27.9 %), user orientation 102 (18.5 %), referral  70  (12.7  %),  and  SDI  57  (10.3  %).  It  is  clear  that  more  than  60  %  of  the  respondents  are  willing  to  pay  for  IT-enabled  services.  The  analysis  shows  the  positive  attitude  of  the  users  for  charging  fee  for  quality  services,  especially  IT-enabled  services  in  the  university  libraries  in  Kerala.  
 The  respondents’  readiness  (65  %)  to  pay  for  information  services  in  different  university  libraries  is given in Table 2. The implication is that they rely  more on the quality of information services than the  existing services, most of them are freely available.  Among the libraries, 70.5 % of the respondents from  MGUL  are  ready  to  pay  for  information  services followed  by  69  %  in  CUSATL.

  The  Chi-square  value  of  6.76  and  p-value  of  0.080  shows  there  is  no  significance  difference  between  libraries. 
  It  has  been  studied  on  willingness  of  different  category of members to pay for information services  shows that among the members majority of the non- teaching staff (82.4 %) followed by teachers (81.8 %)  and  public  (75  %)  are  ready  to  pay  for  information  services. A  sizable  proportion  of  research  scholars  (69.38  %)  and  students  (53.8  %)  are  also  willing  to  pay  for  various  information  services  is  against  the  popular  belief  that  students  generally  opposed  the  move  of  charging  fee  for  information  services  in the university libraries. Chi-square value of 52.37  and p-value,  zero  shows  the  significant  difference  between  different  category  of  users  opinion  about  charging  the  information  services  at  1  %  level  of  significance. The analysis shows that 65.4 % of the  total  respondents  are  ready  to  pay  for  information  services. 
6.2.2  Current  Charging  Pattern 
  University libraries can price their information  products or services in the form of membership fee,  annual subscription, overdue charges, photocopying  charge,  internet  browsing  charge,  printout  charge,  etc.  To  assess  the  users  attitude  for  the  present  pricing policy, seven items were asked to the users  for  their  perception  in  a  five  point  scale  which  are  given  in  Table  3. 
    It  is  found  that  the  charge  of  all  the  items  identified varies from library to library. At CUSATL, there  is no membership deposit and annual subscription for

the academic community. 34.2 % of the respondents  consider internet service is provided at a moderate  rate. 
6.2.3 Attitude  Towards  Extent  of  Payment 
    A  library  as  a  non-profit  organisation  does  not  sell  its  products  or  services  for  profit  but  for  recovery,  maintenance,  and  other  related  costs.  It  is  found  from  the  study  that  out  of  those  who  are  willing  to  pay  for  information  products  or  services,  most  of  the  users  in  CHMKL  (92.9  %)  are  ready  to  bear  50  %  and  only  7.1  %  are  willing  to  pay  full  cost  of  the  end  products/services.  In  KUL  80.6  %  of  the  respondents  are  willing  to  pay  50  %  of  the  cost  and  16.3  %  are  ready  to  pay  for  full-cost,  while  only  4  %  has  no  objection  even  if  the  library  makes a little profit out of the products or services.  Almost  same  proportion  of  users  in  MGUL  and  CUSAT  are  ready  to  pay  for  half  of  the  cost  or  full  cost,  while  6.7  %  of  the  users  in  CUSAT  wishes  to make some profit for the library. The Chi-square  test shows that there is significant difference in the  opinion of users regarding the extent of payment in  different  university  libraries  in  Kerala.  Overall,  the  response  is  found  to  be  encouraging.  
From the data for the membership-wise analysis,  it  is  found  that  the  students  are  willing  to  pay  for  information products or services 91.6 % (half of the  actual  cost),  84.4  %  of  the  research  scholars  and  82.1  %  of  the  public  are  ready  to  pay  for  50  %  of  the  actual  cost  while  62.6  %  of  the  teachers  and  57.1%  of  the  non-teaching  staff  are  willing  to  pay  half  of  the  cost.  Among  the  respondents  who  are  ready  to  pay  for  full  cost,  majority  of  them  are  teachers (31.8 %) and only 7.9 % are the students.  Only  5.6  %  of  the  teachers  and  11.5  %  of  the  non-teaching  staffs  have  no  objection  even  if  the  library  makes  a  little  profit  out  of  the  products  or  services,  since  they  have  more  payment  capacity  than  others.

for repositioning the university library system, they  have to start with the infrastructure, appearance of  the building, furniture, library guides, arrangement of  books on the shelves and labelling in the shelves etc.  A proactive approach to the information requirements  of the users by the staff is also called for. Effective  use  of  the  press  and  other  mass  communication  media  and  the  web  is  also  needed.  Some  of  the  suggestions  are: 
(i) Institutional repository 
Presently,  KUL  has  a  digital  repository  of  rare  collections of Kerala studies named as ‘LIbMAS’ but  MGUL and CUSATL have institutional repository (IR)  of their thesis. It should be the primary responsibility  
as  a  channel  for  each  university  library  to  make  them  available  and  to  preserve  them  with  full  responsibilities.  
(ii)   p reparation  of guidelines  for research  
publications 
Each university library in Kerala should prepare  the  guidelines  for  the  research  publications  and  make it available to the academic community through  printed  form,  e-form  or  webpage/web  portal.    (iii)Organisation  of  Information  Literacy  
programmes 
The  development  of  information  literacy  skills  and knowledge throughout the university community  should take up as an initiative for supporting literacy  skills. for the successful implementation they have  to  collaborate  with  academic  staff  to  introduce,  develop and evaluate information literacy within the  curriculum  and  with  external  partners  such  as  the  Centre  for  Information  Literacy  Studies,  University  of Kerala and share expertise by providing a range  of  information  literacy  services.  
(iv)  b uilding  Library website 
Promoting library’s services, information products,  resources, and programme through online becomes  a lot easier with the help of library website. CUSATL  and KUL have already been using their own website  for  propagating  library  news,  notices,  information  services and products and other libraries may take  similar  steps.  
8.    cON cLUSIONS 
University libraries in Kerala are being challenged  as never before to maintain their relevance in higher  education and to their academic community. However,  only  if  they  market  their  services  effectively  to  their  users,  they  will  continue  to  hold  a  prime  role  in  fulfilling  the  information  needs.  Therefore,  they  should take up this challenge with proper marketing  strategies  and  techniques  and  integrate  marketing  and  communication.  The  use  of  web  technology  has  to  be  made  profusely  for  the  achievement  of  this  goal.
