3.      MeThO dOlOGy 
The  Web  of  Science  database  was  used  for  retrieving  data  on  mobile  technology  during  2000- 2013, using search term namely ‘mobile technology’  in  ‘topic  field’.    A  total    of  10638  publications  and  138297 citations received to these publications were  transferred to spread sheet application and analysed  the  data  as  per  objectives  of  the  study.

4.1  Forms  of  Publications 
A total of 10638 publications were published in  mobile  technology  during  2000-2013.  The  highest  numbers  of  publications  8474  (79.66  %)  were  published as journal articles, followed by conference  proceedings with 1418 (13.33 %) publications. Review  papers ranks the 3rd position with 417 (3.92 %) and  letters  in  the  fourth  place  with  162  (1.52  %).  
4.2 language-wise distribution  of  Publications 
Publications  on  mobile  technology  are  spread  over 23 languages. The most predominant language  used  for  communication  was  English.  The  English  language articles were about 97.80 % and the rest  of  2.20  %  were  scattered  in  other  22  languages.  
4.3 relative  Growth rate  and doubling  Time 
The Relative Growth Rate (RGR) is the increase  in number of articles or pages per unit of time. The  mean  RGR  over  the  specific  period  of  interval  can  be  calculated  from  the  following  equation. 
Mean  RGR  =  1-2R   =  log 
eW2 
  –  log 
eW1/T2-T1 
where,  1-2R   is  mean  relative  growth  rate  over  the  specific  period  of  interval;  loge W1   is  log  of  initial  number  of  articles;  logeW2 is  log  of  final  number  of  articles  after  a  specific  period  of  interval  and;  T2-T1 is  the  unit  difference  between  the  initial  time  and  the  final  time. 
The year can be taken here as the unit of time.  Therefore, 1-2R  (aa 
-1 
 year 
-1) can represent the mean  relative  growth  rate  per  unit  of  articles  per  unit  of  year  over  a  specific  period  of  interval. 
Doubling  time  (DT)  =  0.693/R

The  analysis  of  data  on  the  mobile  technology  output  has  been  done  with  parameters  such  as  
RGR  and  DT.  The  data  has  been  analysed  and  presented  in  Table  1.  It  has  been  observed  from  Table  1,  that  RGR  decreased  from  0.78  in  2001  to  0.16 in 2009. In 2010 to 2012, it remained constant  (0.16) which is less than the earlier years.  In 2013,  of  RGR  was  decreased  to  0.15.  The  value  of  of  publications increased from 0.89 in 2001 to 4.33 in  2009. In 2010 to 2012, it remained constant (4.33)  which  is  more  than  the  earlier  years.  In  2013,  the  value  of  DT  was  increased  to  4.62.

The  RGR  is  decreased  from  0.78  in  2001  to 0.15 in 2013 and DT of the publications gradually  increased from 0.89 in 2001 to 4.62 in 2013 in the  span of 14 years of this study. But in earlier study,  the  RGR  has  decreased  from  2003  (0.98)  to  2012  (0.13)  and  the  DT  increased  from  0.71  in  2003  to  5.15  in  2012  in  the  span  of  10  years. 
In this study, there were 101 countries involved  in  research  in  mobile  technology  field.  The  USA  topped  the  list  with  2738  publications  followed  by  UK with 890 publications. China ranked 3rd  position  with 823 publications and India stood 16th  rank with  202 publications. But in the earlier study, there are  75 countries involved in carrying out research in the  field. China ranked 1st   33010  publications  followed  by USA with 19166 publications. Japan ranked third  position with 11730 publications and India stood 7th rank  with  6150  publications.    
Total 1337 authors had contributed entire research  output  of  the  earlier  study.  Wang,  Wei  is  the  most  productive author contributing 223 articles followed  by  Barolli,  Leonard  with  160  articles  and  Wong,  Kin  Lu  with  154  articles  respectively.  The  analysis  on  author  affiliation  reveals  that  in  the  earlier  paper  the  Institute  of  Electrical  and  Electronics  Engineering  of  USA  tops  the  list  with  1248  articles  followed by National Mobile Communications Research  Laboratory,  Southeast  University,  China  with  508  publications. But in the current paper the University  of  California  System,  USA  tops  the  list  with  243  articles  followed  by  University  of  London,  UK  with  149  publications.

The present paper is mobile technology publication  output  on  Web  of  Science  during  the  period  2000  to 2013. The highest numbers of publications 8474  (79.66  %) were published in journal articles, followed  by  conference  proceedings  with  1418  (13.33  %)  publications. Kim, S. University of Rochester, USA  is the most productive author contributing 42 articles  
(0.39  %)  followed  by  Kim,  H.  Korea  University,  South  Korea  with  36  articles  (0.34  %)  and  Kim,  J.  Kyung  Hee  University,  South  Korea  with  36  articles  (0.34  %)  respectively.  Lecture  Notes  in  Computer Science, Germany gets top rank in terms  of number of publications and IEEE Communications  Magazine,  USA  gets  top  rank  in  terms  of  impact  factor. As usual, journal articles were the preferred  medium  of  authors  in  the  field  to  communicate  their  research  works  and  English  was  the  most  predominant language in which 98 % of the articles  was  published. The  pattern  of  authorship  indicates  that the discipline of mobile technology is dominated  by  multi  authored  publications.  The  findings  of  the  present  Scientometric  study  will  be  beneficial  for  the  researchers,  who  are  engaged  in  research  on  various  disciplines  of  mobile  technology  in  future.
