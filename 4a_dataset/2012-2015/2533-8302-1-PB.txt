ABSTRACT
Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) is one of the oldest institutes of management and
generally accepted as one of the leading business schools in India. Established in 1961, IIMA is frequented
by the industry, local and global, to recruit its future leaders. An inherently academic institution of excellence,
IIMA has unfortunately not been known for traditional research output in the form of papers in journals, as
is the case with many international research institutions. It is in this context that the present study aims to
review the research performance of IIMA based on the papers published in journals that have been indexed
in Web of Science and Scopus for the past twelve years. The authors attempt to identify the trends in research
output over the period 1999 to 2010 that includes types of publications, most preferred journals, most prolific
authors from IIMA, authorship pattern, and the journals most cited by the researchers from IIMA. The findings
throw interesting facts like increase in number of papers being published by IIMA over the years 1999 to 2010,
increase in collaborations among authors, decrease in single author publications and multi disciplinary nature
of research undertaken at the Institute.
Keywords: Bibliometric analysis, management research, citation analysis, research productivity

1. INTRODUCTION
The Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad
(IIMA), was established as an autonomous institution in
1961 by the Government of India in collaboration with the
local government and industry. The initial knowledge
partner in this project was the Harvard Business School,
USA. Established as a teaching institution, the Institute
offers a two-year Post Graduate Programme in
Management (PGP) in addition to various other
programmes like the Post Graduate Programme in AgriBusiness Management (PGP-ABM), Post Graduate
Programme in Management for Executives (PGPX),
Armed Forced Programme (AFP), Faculty Development
Programme (FDP), short term Management Development
Programmes (MDP) and Fellow Programme in
Management (FPM). While the PGP is equivalent to an
MBA, the FPM is doctoral programme in management.
Like the other programmes at the Institute, the doctoral
programme is also very well recognised in the corporate
and academic sector with all its doctoral students
bagging excellent offers much before they complete their
degree requirements. The IIMA is one of the few b-schools

in India that is accredited by the EQUIS (European
QUality Improvement System). The Institute FTE (Full
Time Equivalent) student population is about one
thousand that includes about 96 faculty members. The
Institute has tie-ups with more than 50 institutions from
outside the country for student and faculty exchange
programmes.
In addition to teaching programmes, research and
publishing has been one of the important activities at the
Institute and much of the publications from the Institute
have been in the form of papers in journals, books, book
chapters, newspaper articles, reviews, conference
papers, working papers and cases. However global
institutional ranking sources like webometrics, Times
QS, US News & World Report, and so on consider
research performance as one of the major indicators for
finalising the ranking positions and include mainly papers
published in journals as the research output1. The
Economist and Financial Times also rank b-school
programmes and consider research output in the form of
papers published in journals as an important basis for the
ranking that they develop. One of the problems with these

research indicators are that they hardly consider Indian
journals thereby putting Indian institutions to a
disadvantage. A recent report of a study that assesses
Indian management research by Kumar & Puranam2
reflected poor output in terms of papers published from
India. The assessment study included specifically 40
journals that were considered by the Financial Times
rankings of b-schools in 2009. The study had identified a
total of 76 papers that were published by Indian
institutions in these 40 journals during 1990 to 2009.
Among the 9 Indian institutions, Indian Institute of
Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) was ranked no. 6 with a
total of 6 papers in the sample considered in the study. It
was argued that this study had limited the scope to
include only papers published in these 40 journals only
and it would have been more realistic if it included the
research output in the form of cases published at these
institutes. The response to this argument by the Kumar &
Puranam3 was that cases were not considered research
and that this list of 40 journals sufficiently reflected
international standing in research.
Whatever are the implications of the debate on the
representative nature of the method or sample adopted in
the study, it is but a fact that research publications play a
very important role in developing credibility and image of
an academic institution. A great institution always
exploits new knowledge and becomes competitive as
against other institutions by investing in knowledge
through research and development. It is in this
background that the present study was undertaken to
explore in detail the research output of researchers at
IIMA. The attempt was to extend the work of Kumar and
Puranam3 and review the publications of IIMA. The aim
was to include publications of IIMA that were included in
international databases that index publications at a global
level. This would bring out a more realistic picture of the
publication profile of IIMA and in a way report the potential
of these papers in being referred to by international
researchers.

2. OBJECTIVES OF STUDY
The broad objectives of this study were to:

•

Measure the research output in terms of papers
published by IIMA during the latest twelve years (1999
to 2010)

•

Identify the journals that were most preferred by
authors from IIMA

•

Identify the most prolific authors from IIMA

•

Identify the authorship pattern of the papers published
from IIMA during the period

•

Identify the journals most cited by the researchers
from the institute.

3. LITERATURE REVIEW
The simplest form of bibliometric indicator is the
publication count and the indicator that is most frequently
used in research evaluation4. Moed5, et al. found that
when used properly bibliometric indicators can act as a
‘monitoring device’ for university research management
and science policy. In line with this school of thought,
studies have been undertaken to evaluate the research
output or publications of an institution and attempted to
highlight the research contribution to subjects, identify
most productive authors at the institution and so on.
Some of the Indian studies that are similar in nature, in
terms of studying the publication count and citation as an
indicator for research evaluation are reviewed in this
section.
To find out the productivity and publication behaviour
of the researchers of Tata Institute of Social Science
(TISS), Koganuramath6, et al. analysed 663 papers
published by the scientists of TISS during 1990-2000 and
provided the collaboration pattern, identified prolific
authors and core journals that were most preferred for
publication by the scientists. The main objective of this
study was to provide a bird’s eye view of the productivity of
TISS scientists and their specialisations.
Kumbar7 extracted 1518 papers in different disciplines
of science and technology during 1996-2006 as seen from
the Scopus database and analysed the strong and weak
areas University of Mysore research, their growth rate,
impact generated in terms of average citations received,
the collaboration pattern in different subjects and
collaboration pattern with authors from various countries.
The study reports that the research publication at the
University was growing at an average rate of 23 per cent
per annum in terms of the papers published.
A similar study was undertaken by considering the
Science Citation Index (SCI) instead of Scopus as a tool
to extract institution research publications by Singh8 , et
al. . The study included 901 papers in various subjects
during the period 1993-2001 and it was observed from the
study that three subject domains namely mathematics,
biology and clinical medicine, although contributing a
small number of papers, secured first three ranks in the
normalised impact factor.
Garg and Rao9 examined the publication data of an
Indian laboratory in the field of physics that were
published in journals covered by SCI and the study also
included non SCI journals and Indian patents filed during
the period 1965-82. The study aimed to identify the
pattern of productivity, sub areas of physics that were
more productive and authorship pattern in the research
work. The study interestingly reported a positive
relationship between manpower expenditure and research
publication.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(4)

To analyse the research productivity, publication
growth, national and international collaboration, etc., of
PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, Vasishta10
undertook a study with publication data from 1996 to 2009
extracted from Scopus. On analysing the 177 papers, the
author finds that though there was a steady growth in
research publications there was a need to substantially
improve the publication output in comparison to the other
engineering institutions. Sharma11 in his study found that
majority of the research publications were an outcome of
joint authorship and the degree of collaboration was very
high among the scientists. This study included 2603
research papers published by the scientists of Central
Potato Research Institute during the period 1991-2007.

4. METHODOLOGY
Among the well known and internationally accepted
secondary databases that could be considered as most
comprehensive, to assess or review the impact of
research in terms of published papers, are Web of
Science from Thomson Reuters and Scopus from
Elsevier. The impact factor of journals and the citation
indices of papers are provided in the Web of Science
database. To take a broader view and extend earlier work
of Kumar & Puranam3, it was decided to explore both
these databases to study the papers published by IIMA
authors.
With the objective of receiving the research output of
IIMA over a reasonable time period, it was decided to
study the period 1999 to 2010. For this purpose the
researchers opted to explore Scopus and Web of Science
for IIMA affiliated publications. The study revealed that
IIMA as an institutional affiliation yielded 172 hits in Web
of Science and 284 hits in Scopus. The results were
tabulated in MS Excel and the duplicates (138) were
removed from the total of 456 entries. The final list
included 318 unique entries for IIMA, from both Web of
Science and Scopus during the period 1999 to 2010.

5. DATA ANALYSIS
5.1 IIMA Publications in Web of Science and
Scopus
As indicated in Table 1, Scopus included more entries
for IIMA as an author affiliated institution, perhaps
reflecting higher coverage of journals that published

papers by authors affiliated to IIMA. Even the unique
content in Scopus was quite high with almost 46 per cent
of the total number of unique entries (318) across both the
databases.

5.2 Types of Publications Published during
1999-2010
Figure 1 reveals that among the 318 unique
publications that were included in Scopus and Web of
Science, 234 were articles (papers published in journals)
that constituted almost 74 per cent of the total
publications during the period of 1999 to 2010. The
category of reviews (research reviews) scored the next
highest position with 30 numbers constituting a little over
9 per cent of the total publications and conference papers
were 24 in number and accounted for nearly 8 per cent of
the publications. the others category (9%) included
editorials, erratum, letters, meeting abstracts, notes,
book reviews, etc.
In the present study, since the main objective was to
review the published papers by IIMA, the category of
Articles was only considered for further analysis. A study
of this category was important as it could very well reflect
the research output of IIMA during this period as this
category represented 74 per cent of the publication output
of the Institute.

5.3 Pattern of Growth in Papers
Figure 2 clearly indicates a steady increase in the
number of papers from IIMA during the selected period
1999 to 2010. The distinct increase in number of papers
being published was seen in the last two years of the
study, i.e., 2009 and 2010. The almost doubling of the
percentage of papers published in 1999 to that of 2010,
clearly reflects the gradual shift of emphasis to publishing
of papers by the IIMA authors. It is interesting to note that
in the last six years (2005 to 2010) there has been a major
turnaround from a meager 3.42 per cent to an impressive
13.68 per cent of the total publications. It may be worth
noting that in the years 2004 and 2005 the percentage of
papers published was a dismal 3.42 per cent, the lowest
in the 12 years of the study.
Since the category of ‘papers’ constitute 74 per cent
of the total publications of IIMA during this period, it was
also found that the same pattern was true for research
output of the Institute.

5.4 Author Productivity during 1999-2010

Table 2. Ranking of authors by productivity (papers published)

The 234 papers included in this study were contributed
by authors, among whom at least one was affiliated to IIMA.
In other words, these 234 papers published during 1999 to
2010 were authored by a total of 367 authors and not all of
them were from IIMA. To extend the study to identify the
productivity of each author from the group of these 367
authors, a ranking of these authors was developed based on
the number of papers contributed, as given in Table 2. The
results indicated that during the period 1999-2010, the most
prolific authors were P. R. Shukla who topped with 21 papers
followed by D. Malvankar with 20 papers. S. Lahiri had 14
papers followed by D. Ghosh with 13 papers, A. Garg with 11
papers and T. Bandyopadhyay with 10 papers. Among the
authors who had contributed to 4 or more papers B.
Goldengorin, G. Sierksma and A. Desai were not affiliated to
IIMA. Table 2 indicates that the largest portion of the author
population consisted of a group of 279 authors who
contributed a single paper each, followed by 46 authors who
contributed to 2 papers each, 18 authors contributed to 3
papers each and 24 authors contributed to more than 4
papers each. Six authors contributed to 10 papers.

5.5 Authorship Collaboration Patterns
Table 3 reveals the authorship pattern among the 612
authors, i.e., 367 unique names, contributed the 234
papers published included in this study. While single
authors, i.e., without any collaboration contributed 62
papers and that constituted about 26 per cent of the total
papers included in the study. The largest group of 34 per
cent of papers was contributed by 2 authors, followed by
19 per cent papers by 3 authors and 12 per cent of papers
by 4 authors. Together about 65 per cent of the papers
were contributed by collaboration among 2 to 4 authors.
The maximum collaboration was found in two papers that
had 14 authors each and it is interesting to note that 7 or
more (8, 10, 11 and 14) authors contributed to less than 1
per cent of the papers each. Figure 3 also clearly reveals
that as the number of authors collaborating increases the
number of papers decreases. A significant portion of the
papers, about 90 per cent, are covered by single author,
two-author, and three-author and four-author partnerships.

The data collected for the study was analysed for looking
at the collaboration pattern undertaken by IIMA authors.
The country of other co-authors was explored and Table 4
shows that collaboration with authors from other parts of
the same country contributed to about 41 per cent of the
papers and was followed by 31 per cent of papers wherein
at least one author was from a different country. It is
interesting to note that the number of papers under the nocollaboration category have reduced over a period of time.
It can be seen that collaboration with authors from abroad
was highest in 2003 and 2006, though the number of
papers published during those years was relatively less. It
may also be noted that the number of papers being
published also increased during the same period and
hence the opportunities of international collaboration
might have also increased. Its also shows that the
collaboration pattern or distribution of all three types, i.e.,
no colloboration, international collaboration and national
collaboration is disctinct across years with the no
collaboration category reducing with time giving way to
more colloborative authoring. Table 5 shows the list of
most preferred journals, listed in the order starting from
most papers published by IIMA authors. It can be seen
that Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics was the

secure top 20 ranks when scored on number of citations
sourced from. It was also found that the top 30 journals
contributed to the 30 per cent of the total citations. The
journal titles that were cited more than 40 times included
Journal of Marketing (66), Economic and Political Weekly
(49), Management Science (47), Journal of Marketing
Research (45) and European Journal of Operational
Research (43). Economic and Political Weekly and Indian
Journal of Agricultural Economics were the only journals
from India in list of these top cited journals.
In an earlier study12 of doctoral dissertations
submitted at IIMA during the period 2004 to 2009, it was
found that the 49 dissertations cited 4319 references from
793 journal titles. When these 793 titles were compared
with the 808 journal titles from the present study, a list of
267 titles were found to be common, indicating more than
30 per cent titles were commonly cited by faculty in their
papers and by doctoral students in their dissertations.
This finding could be used in developing the list of core
group of journals in the collection of the Institute’s library.

6. CONCLUSIONS
With the main focus on studying the research output
of IIMA, the data collected and analysed revealed
interesting findings. Some major conclusions that could
be drawn from the findings are:
(a) The potential and need to improve the research output
in form of papers is quite evident from the study. It
may be useful to look at research output of
institutions with similar academic output like
programmes offered, faculty time involvement in
academic administration, faculty contribution in
developing teaching materials, and so on.
(b) The data from the study indicates improvement in
research output of IIMA in the recent years and it may
be the right time to further the strategy of developing
research friendly policies and take the research
output of the Institute to the next level.
(c) Evaluation of individual authors, based on productivity
data can be considered either by number of papers or
by the impact factor of journals in which they publish
or by the average weightage per paper published by
the author.

indicated in the citation data and this may call for a
debate on the larger issues of encouraging Indian
citations by Indian researchers.
This study could be a useful tool to understand the
research trend at IIMA, indicating a fairly accurate
direction to be taken based on a data available in Web of
Science and Scopus. This study could be supplemented
by undertaking a review of all papers published by the
IIMA authors, irrespective of being included in Web of
Science or Scopus and develop a comprehensive
perspective of research at IIMA.

collaboration with multiple authors and with
international authors may have also lead to increase
in publications and this aspect could be considered
while refining the research policy of the Institute.
