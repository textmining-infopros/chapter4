ABSTRACT 
 Libraries and information centres are established with a mission to provide right information to the  right user at the right time and in the right amount. Library and information science (LIS) professionals apply  their competencies for achieving this mission of libraries. In the past, LIS professionals were providing  services within the premises of the library but now with the aid of technology they can reach to their patrons  both within premises as well as outside the premises of the library. This outreach of LIS professionals  to their clientele has opened doors for embedded librarianship.To develop appropriate competencies  among LIS professionals for becoming successful embedded librarians, LIS schools can play a pivotal  role. This paper highlights the dynamic nature of LIS profession and describes the concept of embedded  librarianship. Role of LIS schools in nurturing the embedded librarianship is also the part of present  paper.  Concept of specialisation in LIS curriculum is a step towards nurturing embedded librarianship.   
Keywords: Embedded librarianship, library and information science, curriculum 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Libraries  are  regarded  as  fountains  and  rich  springs  of  knowledge  that  illuminate  and  irrigate  the fields of academics, economics, cultural, social,  political and many other sectors of the society. Main  mission  of  any  library  and  information  centre  is  to  facilitate  the  easy  accessibility  of  information  to  library patrons. The library and information science  (LIS) professionals provide information in an effective  and  efficient  manner  by  using  different  techniques  (both manual and mechanical). To fulfill the mission  of  providing  right  information  to  the  right  person,  LIS professional perform different library operations  like selection of information sources, acquisition of  information  sources,  processing  and  preservation  of  information  sources  and  making  information  and  information  sources  available  to  the  persons  at  the  time  when  they  require  information.Earlier,  users  were  coming  to  the  library  for  quenching  their  thirst  of  gaining  knowledge  by  consulting  different sources of information and librarians were  providing every kind of help to them, whether in the  form  of  reference  services  or  through  inculcating  different skills among users by organising orientation  programmes  or  user-education  programmes. 1.1  Transformation  in  Library  and  Information  
Centres 
With the advent of information and communication  
technologies (ICT), libraries and information centers  witnessed various transformation after transformation.  New trends emerged in the profession of librarianship  and there is a paradigm shift in the basic philosophies  of  the  profession.  Some  of  these  shifts  are:  1.1.1  Paper  Media  to  other  Media 
In the past, libraries were just the places where  one  will  come  across  different  information  sources  in  print  format.  Now  sources  are  in  digital  formats  like  e-journals,  e-books,  e-zines,  CD-ROM,  etc.  With  the  aid  of  technology,  information  sources  containing audio, video, text, graphics, and images  at one place are existing in the market and libraries  and  information  centres  acquire  these  multimedia  sources  of  information.  
1.1.2  Possession  to Access 
Notion of librarians about the size of collection in  the past, i.e., bigger the best has changed. Instead  of  focusing   on  building  huge  collection,  library  professionals  now  think  in  terms  of  facilitating  the  user’s access to information. In the digital environment,  library patrons can get access to digital sources of  information  from  any  place  at  any  time.  
1.1.3  Preservation  to  Utilisation 
Libraries in the past were giving more importance  to  preservation  of  documents.  However,  with  the

invention of printing press and due to the revolution  brought  about  by  ICT,  now  library  and  information  professionals  give  more  attention  towards  making  information  more  and  more  utilised  by  the  library  patrons.  All  efforts  are  made  by  the  professionals  whereby users information needs can be fulfilled so  that  users  are  able  to  achieve  their  objectives. 1.1.4  Manual  Process  to  Mechanical  Process  
(Automation) 
Library  operations  in  the  past  were  performed  manually  but  now  majority  of  these  activities  are  being performed with the aid of technology. Different  library  software  packages  have  been  created  for  modernising  the  libraries  and  information  centers.  1.1.5  Caretaker  to  Gatekeeper 
Role of library professionals has also witnessed  a marvelous change. In the past they were regarded  as  custodians  of  the  library  resources  but  now  the  role  of  a  facilitators  are  attributed  to  them.  They  are equipped with all those competencies necessary  for navigating the digital resources available on the  ubiquitous  World  Wide  Web.  Due  to  their  role  new  labels are in vogue. Labels like information scientist,  knowledge  manager,  documentation  officer,  etc.,  have  emerged  to  describe  the  role  of  librarian  in  the  knowledge  world.  
1.1.6  Isolation  to  Consortia 
Digital  information  landscape  has  provided  opportunity  for  different  libraries  to  join  hands  with  each  other  for  sharing  their  resources.  In  India,  a  number  of  consortia  have  emerged  like  INDEST,  UGC Infonet, etc., through these consortia libraries  provide  effective  and  efficient  services  to  library  patrons for enhancing the chances for fulfilling their  information  needs.  
1.1.7  Free  Services  to  Fee-based  Services 
To add value to  the information being provided  by  the  library,  library  charges  some  fee  from  the  library users. Nominal fee is charged from users who  need some value-added service from the libraries. Fee collected from users can be used for upgrading  the  overall  system  of  libraries  to  come  up  to  the  expectations  of  all  the  stakeholders.  
1.1.8  Physical  Interior  Premises  to  Open  World 
Libraries and information centers were performing  their  operations  and  providing  services  to  library  patrons  only  within  the  premises  of  the  libraries  in  the  past  but  now  with  the  advent  of  ubiquitous  internet,  etc.,  libraries  can  reach  people  outside  the  premises  of  their  four  walls. 
1.1.9  Traditional  Libraries  to  Virtual  Libraries 
All the developments in the information landscape  
450 
have  provided  a  favorable  environment  for  the  evolutionary  and  revolutionary  trends  occurring  in  the world of libraries. From traditional libraries have  emerged,  automated  libraries,  electronic  libraries,  digital  libraries  and  library  without  walls,i.e.,virtual  libraries.  
1.2 Changing  Information  Landscape  and  Role  
of  LIS  Professionals 
In the present information landscape role of library  and information science professionals has increased.  Reason being that there are challenges posed by a  number of factors to both library professionals and  their  customers.  Some  of  these  factors  are:  (a) Knowledge  explosion; 
(b)  Information  overload;  and 
(c)  Information  anxiety 
These information-related issues have increased  the credibility of library and information professionals  among  the  users.The  LIS  professionals  can  utilise  their professional expertise for solving the problems  faced by library patrons due to these reasons. With  the aid of technology, LIS professionals can provide  their assistance not only within the premises of the  library  but  also  can  reach  to  the  library  patrons  at  their  workplaces  easily.  
However, LIS professionals need some advanced  competencies  for  delivering  their  professional  obligations  in  an  effective  and  efficient  manner.  Users  can  approach  the  librarian  from  outside  premises  in  a  virtual  mode  or  librarian  can  come  at their workplaces for giving them professional and  technical support in locating right information at the  right  time.  Thus  LIS  professionals  empower  library  patrons  in  exploiting  information  and  information  sources  optimally.  Great  scientists,  philosophers,  scholars, etc., have fully recognised the contribution  of  LIS  professionals  and  have  lucidly  expressed  it  in  their  acknowledgements.  
This active participation of LIS professionals with  their users has opened a new facet of librarianship,  viz.,  embedded  librarianship.

4.  fINDINg S AND DISCUSSIONS 
4.1 Embedded  Librarianship 
Different  people  have  expressed  their  point  of  view on embedded librarianship differently. However,  the  basic  consensus  is  on  the  participation  of  LIS  professionals among his/ customers either physically  or virtually. Dewey1 defines embedding as a concept  in  which  the  one  distinct  group  is  integrated  with  another . As such when librarians involve themselves  actively  with  persons  from  other  disciplines  and  provide  information  support  both  on  demand  as  well  as  in  anticipation  of  demand  lays  foundation  to  embedded  librarianship.  Shumaker2 stresses  on  effective  collaboration  and  closer  relationship  of  library professionals with their customers because the  library is focused on the user’s needs. Shumaker and  Taylor3  have expressed their ideas about embedded  librarian  as”  Whether  your  title  is  ‘Knowledge  Analyst’, ‘Field Librarian’, ‘Informationist’, ‘Librarian- in-Context’,  ‘Client-Embedded  Services  Librarian’,  ‘project Information Specialist’, or something else, if  a regular part of your work involves participating in  a group, community, or organisational unit primarily  made  up  of  non-librarians,  providing  knowledge  and  information  services  as  a  part  of  the  group,  then  you  are  participating  in  a  growing  trend  of  embedding  librarians  and  their  services  in  settings  outside  the  library.  In  a  more  lucid  and  simple  manner  the  ey  element  of  embedded  librarianship  
has  been  explained  by  Ricco  &  Myers4   as:  “It  is  to  move  the  librarians  out  of  the  traditional  library  setting,  whether  physically  or  virtually,  and  into  a  new  framework  for  providing  library  services.  It  shifts  the  emphasis  from  reactively  answering  research  requests  in  a  vacuum  to  developing  a  unique  understanding  of  what  customers  need  and  delivering  proactive  results”.  Thus  all  efforts  of  embedded  librarian  are  revolving  around  library  patrons. Satisfaction of library patron is the priority  of  embedded  librarianship.  
For achieving this satisfaction embedded librarianis  supposed to develop close proximity with the users of  library. Glynn & Wu5  is of the opinion that personal  contact,  telephone  calls,  and  e-mail  messages  are  just  a  few  of  the  ways  that  librarian  liaisons  can  demonstrate  a  sincere  interest  in  the  scholarly  activities of department faculty, as well as furnishing  new  services  and  materials.  
Embedded librarianship can lead to rich dividends  for  all  the  stakeholders.  Jacobs6   while  addressing  the  benefits  of  embedded  librarianship  comments  that it creates ‘win-win’ like situation which is often  used in business to describe a deal that works well  for both parties. Embedded librarianship is a winning  proposition  not  only  for  the  constituents  served,  but  for  the  librarian  who  has  the  opportunity  to  make a positive difference for students and faculty.  If  library  professionals  are  willing  to  step  outside  the  library  to  serve  their  patrons  when  and  where  they  are  needed,  their  value  to  the  processes  of  teaching, learning, and scholarship will be enhanced.  In  such  type  of  librarianship,  LIS  professional  can  use  World  Wide  Web  for  reaching  to  their  patrons  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  
4.1.1  Features  of  Embedded  Librarianship  
Some  features  of  embedded  librarianship  are: •	 It  is  customer-centric  not  library-centric •	 Knowledge  of  the  particular  subject/discipline/  
domain is more important than professional skills  
possessed  by  LIS  professionals. 
•	 Usually  only  a  small  group  of  users  is  focused  
and  not  the  entire  population.

DJLIT,  VOL.  34,  NO.  6, NOVEMbER   2014 
•	 Services  are  provided  to  specialists  and  not  to  
generalists. 
•	 More  focus  is  given  on  analysis  and  synthesis  
than  delivery  of  information. 
•	 LIS  professional  get  actively  involved  at  the  
workplace  of  his  clientele  than  at  his  own  
workplace. 
Always  perform  their  activities  in  the  context  and  not  out  of  context.  Embedded  librarians  try  their best for satisfying their clientele. It is as such  evident from these features of embedded librarianship  that  they  must  have  thorough  knowledge  about  a  particular subject like medicine, agriculture, law, etc.,  those library and information science professionals  who  are  possessing  sufficient  knowledge  about  a  particular  subject  can  be  successful  embedded  librarians.  
4.1.2  Examples  of  Embedded  Librarians  in  
Libraries 
Scope  of  embedded  librarianship  is  very  wide.  Embedded librarians are having features that make  them  relevant  in  any  working  environment.  Some  examples  of  embedded  librarianship  are: 
Librarians working in the profession of medicine  need  some  specialised  knowledge  for  dealing  with  information related to different branches of medical  profession. These embedded librarians in health sector  can play a very important role in disseminating right  information  to  the  right  users  of  information  in  an  effective and efficient manner. Similarly, law librarians  know  better  about  information  related  to  the  legal  profession.  There  are  LIS  professionals  who  had  earned specialisation in the record archives and as  record archivists, they can play their important role.  Embedded  librarians  associated  with  business  and  financial  sector  can  perform  nicely  for  promoting  and  achieving  the  goals  of  that  business.  
In the present era, when there is interdisciplinary  and multidisciplinary trends operating in the universe  of knowledge, LIS professionals can get involved in  projects and can work within a team of collaborators  Librarians  due  to  their  specialised  knowledge  and  competencies  will  prove  their  mettle  as  embedded  LIS  professionals  in  the  team  by  offering  both  customised and anticipatory information services to  all the members of that team. In the present IT era  there is the need of librarians having specialisation  in dealing with digital artifacts. For describing digital  objects, librarians create different sets of metadata.  Thus,  there  is  scope  for  metadata  librarians.  
It is evident that library professionals working in  public, academic, school, medical, oriental, agriculture  law, defence, etc., and in any other specialised library  setting  can  use  embedded  librarianship  principles  to  enhance  their  working  and  careers.  
452 
4.2  Role  of  LIS  Schools  in  Nurturing 
Embedded  Librarianship 
Library and information science schools play an  important role in developing competent professionals  for  managing  libraries  of  all  hues  in  the  society.  Through sound teaching and up to date curriculum, LIS  schools provide a favorable environment to students  for learning new skills and knowledge for performing  their professional obligations in an efficient manner7.  Library science schools are regularly redefining the  curriculum contents to make their passouts relevant  for  today  and  tomorrow.  To  achieve  this  objective,  LIS  schools  are  offering  specialisation  in  different  areas like health, agriculture,etc., as is evident from  the  curriculum  adopted  by  these  schools.  
4.2.1  Specialisation  and  Embedded  Librarianship 
Offering  specialisation  in  the  discipline  of  LIS  is actually a step for building embedded librarians.  In these specialisations, teachers give exposure to  different facets of the subject so that students taking  these specialised courses are able to offer effective  and  qualitative  information  services  to  the  library  patrons.  University  Grants  Commission  (UGC),  the  apex  body  for  governing  higher  education  in  India  has also incorporated concept of special information  systems in its model curriculum report published in  year  under  title  CDC-Model  curriculum  (2001)8 for  LIS.  A  number  of  special  information  systems  are  enumerated in CDC report. The general objectives of  this  module  as  given  in  the  CDC  report  are  to: •	 Understand 	 the 	 structure 	 and 	 development 	 of 	 
the  subject/discipline 
•	 Prepare 	 specialised 	 professional 	 manpower 	 in 	 
the  subject/discipline  for  handling  information- 
related  activities 
•	 Provide 	 in-depth 	 knowledge 	 and 	 specialised 	 skills 	 
in handling documentary and non documentary  
sources  in  specific  field  of  knowledge 
•	 Enable 	 the 	 students 	 to 	 design 	 and 	 develop 	 
information  system  in  new/emerging  areas/  
disciplines 
•	 Explore 	 feasibility 	 of 	 application 	 of 	 information 	 
technology  and  the  related-aspects  in  their  
implementation  
In the CDC-report, there are 10 elective papers  with  following  nomenclature: 
(1) Health  information  system 
(2)   b usiness  information  system 
(3) Agricultural  information  system 
(4) Social  science  information  system 
(5) Environmental  information  system 
(6) Legal  information  system

4.2.2 Entrepreneurship  Avenues  for  Pass-Outs  
from  LIS  Schools  
In  the  present  world  of  specialisations,  pass- outs  from  LIS  schools  are  having  prosperous  job  opportunities.  Few  entrepreneurial  avenues  are: •	 Library 	 Consultants: 	 Now 	 a 	 day’s 	 corporate 	 sector 	 
have realised the importance of information and  
(a) Seven departments have adopted health information  
system. 
(b) Four departments are teaching business information  
system. 
(c) Four  departments  have  adopted  agricultural  
information  system. 
(d) Two  departments  are  conducting  courses  of  
social  science  information  system 
(e) One department each has adopted environmental  
information system, natural science information  
system, and engineering & technological information  
system. 
It is also analysed from Fig. 2 that the contents  
are very keen in developing their own library for  
fulfilling their information needs. Here, competent  
being taught in these courses mainly revolve around  LIS  professionals  can  play  an  efficient  role  in  
the  following: 
developing  libraries.  
•	 Automation 	 Consultant: 	 LIS 	 students 	 well 	 equipped 	 
with  the  competencies  needed  for  automation  
of different library activities can get offers from  
different  libraries  for  automating  the  libraries. 
•	 E-resource 	 Manager: 	 LIS 	 students 	 with 	 specialisation 	 
have opportunity to act as an expert in managing  
e-resources  in  the  information  system.  
•	 Career 	 Counselor: 	 There 	 are 	 various 	 career 	 counseling 	 
agencies. LIS students with excellent interpersonal  
skills  can  act  as  a  career  counselor. 
4.3  Specialisation  Offered  by  Departments 
The  LIS  departments  in  North  India  under  the  scope  of  this  study  have  responded  to  these  electives differently which is shown in Table 1. From  Table  1  it  is  evident  that  there  is  no  uniformity  among departments in teaching specialised courses.  Following  observations  have  been  made:

professionals  so  that  they  can  become  successful  librarians of the future. The most important competency  for  embedded  librarians  are  the  skills  required  for  building close relationship with the library patrons.  e,  LIS schools must take care of developing soft skills  among the budding librarians. besides soft skills LIS  professionals  must  possess  sound  knowledge  and  skills about ICT. In the present information landscape  librarians  should  have  enough  knowledge  about  the  social  networking  tools  and  their  application  in  libraries  and  information  centers.  
5.  CONCLUSIONS 
present age is the age of specialisation. In any  discipline  whether  medical  sciences,  agricultural  science, engineering and technology ,etc., all disciplines  have  developed  specialised  streams.  Librarians  when  equipped  with  sufficient  knowledge  about  a  particular  discipline,  can  perform  their  professional  obligations  in  a  more  effective  way. by  organising  information  literacy  programs,  library  professionals  can  make  his  patrons  proficient  in  the  optimum,  effective and judicious use of information for not only  enhancing the understanding but productive utilisation  of  information  resources.  by  providing  personal  assistance  and  assistance  through  virtual  means,  embedded  librarians  can  raise  their  professional  status  in  particular  and  the  whole  profession  of  librarianship in general. Thus, the need of the hour  is  that  LIS  schools  make  appropriate  measures  to  import qualitative education to students by integrating  more  and  more  specialisations  in  the  curriculum.
