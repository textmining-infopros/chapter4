ABSTRACT
This paper reports on the awareness and usage analysis of Web 2.0 technologies by library professionals
in library and in their personal life at their workplaces. The methodology for the proposed study is ‘Survey
Method’ with the help of structured questionnaire. The sample respondents chosen for the study consists
of librarians, deputy librarians, assistant librarians, and library assistants. Total 100 questionnaires were
distributed (randomly) to the selected sample for the current year; 92 valid samples were collected and
analyzed. Web 2.0 is especially useful and creative when knowledge is digitized made modular and allowed
to be used and distributed in a flexible way. Study was carried out to know the awareness regarding Web
2.0 tools like blogs, wikipedia, RSS Feed, social networks, podcasting, and others (SNS, mashup). It is observed
from the study that significant portion of the respondents have good knowledge about the Web 2.0. Web 2.0
provided innovative and interesting resources for librarians to serve their users as quickly and effectively
as possible with new ways. The respondents having excellent skills of internet usage were more inclined
towards adoption of Web 2.0 technologies in their personal life. In the geographical distribution, the libraries
are far away from Web 2.0 technologies. To explore the factors affecting toward adoption of Web 2.0
technologies in the libraries, a comprehensive study should be conducted on the country level.
Keywords: Web 2.0, blogs, Wikis, RSS feed, podcasting, social bookmarking

1. INTRODUCTION
The libraries or resource centres and information
services in this decade have made a great stride in being
able to play a leading role. These, along with
organisations that manage information, have had to
integrate the necessary technological changes to adapt
to the new challenges. For this, they have made important
investments in technology, to update their infrastructure,
and in training their personnel.
The current online presence of information services is
important and in continuous evolution, just like the web
itself. The current web, which includes the traditional web
and the so-called Web 2.0 or Social Web, is increasingly
based more on the active role of its users. Users are no
longer simple consumers of contents and services, but
have become an active part in its development by
producing and sharing all sorts of contents.The innovation
of Web 2.0 has radically redefined the world wide web by
facilitating two-way communication through social
networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and blogs.
Web 2.0 takes the stagnant Web 1.0 and makes it more

user-driven, collaborative, participatory, and personalised.
This study measures how effectively librarians are
capturing this opportunity for increased student
engagement1.

2. SCOPE OF STUDY
2.1 Statement of Problem
Many early-adopters began to experiment with Web
2.0 tools such as RSS feeds, wikis, chat tools,
podcasting, video-sharing, and bookmarking. Since then,
all kinds of surveys have been conducted in jurisdictions
that describe how these tools are used2-6. In addition,
academic librarians regularly report on their use of social
media at association meetings and in scholarly papers,
but no Western Uttar Pradesh-wide study has yet been
conducted on application of Web 2.0 tools. The library
and information sciences literature is filled with applied
research, opinion-based case studies and early
theoretical research7 but generally it lacks a strong
empirical base. It is not known, for example, what types of
Web 2.0 technologies are commonly used by libraries

and whether they adapted their traditional bibliographic or
legacy systems to respond to service expectations
created by social media. Finally, there is a need to
establish an overall view of innovative uses of Web 2.0
technology in Indian academic libraries specially in
engineering libraries for capturing best practices and to
apply that information to developing frameworks and novel
services for faculty, staff, and students.

the survey of 60 universities, Chu3 explored that ‘where
electronic services are becoming more and more popular,
an increasing number of academic libraries are applying
or planning to apply Web 2.0 technologies like wikis’. The
study also highlighted the three most commonly reported
difficulties; low participation rate of users, difficulty in
promoting the new technology, and users’ lack of
knowledge towards usage of wikis.

2.2 Scope of Study

To explore the extent of Web 2.0 technologies
applications, Xu10, et al. surveyed of 81 academic libraries’
website in the New York State. They found that 34 (42 %)
libraries incorporated one or more Web 2.0 applications
for various purposes. The maximum usage of the Web 2.0
technologies was blogs while the least adopted
technology named podcasting in the libraries.

The present study deals usage analysis of Web 2.0
technologies by library professionals in selected
engineering colleges at Western Uttar Pradesh. The
geographical area is restricted to Western Uttar Pradesh
only. Further studies could identify which barriers occur at
which stages in the Web 2.0 technologies using process
and how can these obstacles be overcome. There is a
vast scope for further research to study different types of
users’ behaviour and attitudes towards the Web 2.0
technologies. The present study is confined to 46
engineering colleges (owned by state government and
private management) at Noida, Greater Noida,
Ghaziabad, and Meerut of Uttar Pradesh (Appendix 1).

3. LITERATURE REVIEW
Web 2.0 provided innovative and interesting resources
for librarians to serve their users as quickly and effectively
as possible with new ways8. In the similar way,
Keralapura9 stressed that information technology (IT)
influenced the functions of libraries and changed the
information seeking behaviour of readers. Being selfmotivated and service minded, this was the responsibility
of librarians to incorporate IT-based resources and
services to satisfy the customers in a better way.
Trend to adopt/use of Web 2.0 in libraries has been
started for last five years. In 2009, Aharony2 explored that
whether librarians working in school, public and academic
libraries were familiar with the technologies of Web 2.0 as
well as they used them in the libraries. According to the
findings of the study, personality characteristics
(resistance to change, cognitive appraisal, empowerment
and extroversion or introversion), computer expertise,
motivation, importance and capacity towards studying
and integrating different applications of Web 2.0 in the
future, influenced librarians’ use of Web 2.0. The individual
differences with respect to technology acceptance were
existed. It was disclosed that library manager as
compared to librarians were more inclined to incorporate
Web 2.0 technologies to offer new services in the
libraries. However the ‘librarians were quite exposed to
these changes. They understood that to survive, remain
relevant, attract new patrons, and be professional, they
should master the newest technological applications and
apply them in their changing work environment’. During
440

Based on the study’s findings, they proposed a
conceptual model Academic Library 2.0 which comprised
Web 2.0, User 2.0, Librarian 2.0 and Information 2.0.
According the model, users can be served in better way
only if they are considered essential part of libraries’
operations and services. Linh11 conducted a survey of 47
Australian and New Zealand universities. Of the total 47,
university libraries (26 in Australia and 6 in New Zealand)
used Web 2.0 technologies. The findings of the study
showed that “at least two-thirds of Australasian university
libraries deployed one or more Web 2.0 technologies.
Only four Web 2.0 technologies were used for specific
purposes and with some basic features”.

4. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
The main objective of the study is to conduct a usage
analysis of Web 2.0 technologies in library by library
professionals of selected engineering colleges at
Western Uttar Pradesh. The other objectives are as
follows:
(a) How are library professionals using Web 2.0
technologies to complement this and to improve
service provision and use in personal life?
(b) Is Web 2.0 making libraries more students-driven by
creating an environment for increased two-way
communication?
(c) Are librarians successfully exploiting the social
nature of Web 2.0 to engage students?

4.1 Research Methodology
The methodology for the proposed study is ‘Survey
Method’ with the help of structured questionnaire. The
structured questionnaire is designed keeping in view of
the stated objectives comprising of various types of
questions, keeping in view of the aspects like total
population of library professionals in the engineering
colleges, perceived level of computer literacy, selection/

recommendation of Web 2.0 tools, promotion of Web 2.0
technology, and future plans to improve usage of Web 2.0
technologies in library. The primary data collected from
the library professionals of the study engineering colleges
(46) through structured user questionnaire. Nonprobability sampling specifically accidental and purposive
technique was applied in the collection of primary data
through the administration of questionnaire. The sample
respondents chosen for the study consists of Librarians,
Deputy Librarians, Assistant Librarians, and Library
Assistants. Total 120 questionnaires were distributed
(randomly) to the selected sample for the current year; 92
valid samples were collected and analysed. A pilot study
was conducted to streamline the user questionnaire in all
of the study colleges. The collected data from
questionnaires is analysed with suitable statistical
methods (descriptive statistics). The defects such as
features and subject, etc., are rectified and finally
questionnaire is free from ambiguity. The primary data
collected through structured questionnaire is analysed by
using suitable statistical techniques like descriptive
statistics.

respondents have good knowledge about the Web 2.0
(Table 1). The respondents were asked to indicate
whether they use Web 2.0 tools in personal work. On
analysis it was observed that all the library professionals
of all the participated engineering colleges have been
using Web 2.0 tools in their personal work. But the
libraries are far away from Web 2.0 technologies (Table 2).
A question was posed to determine which particular
Web 2.0 tools are being used in their library. Table 3
depicts the results and on analyses it is observed that in
equal percentage (7.61 %), the library professionals are
using blogs and RSS feed in their respective library. Yet,
there are still majorities who do not use Web 2.0 in library
(Table 4). A question was posed regarding which particular
blogs are being used in their personal life (Table 4).
Analysing Table 4, it is observed that 83.69 %
respondents are using Lislink for their personal use
followed by INFLIBNET (33.69 %). This means that the
respondents are using blogs for their personal use only
not for the library services (Table 4).
The study further explored to determine which wikis is
popular among the library professionals. The results
depicted in Table 5. On analysing it is observed that
en.wikipedia (46.74%) is most popular among the library
professionals followed by en.wiktionary (23.91 %). The
respondents are using wikis for their personal use only
not for the library services. The study further explored to
determine which RSS Reader is popular among the library

5. SURVEY RESULTS
There were 49 (53.26 %) librarians, 15 (16.30%)
deputy librarians, 17 (18.48 %) assistant librarians, and
11 (11.96%) library assistants. Study was carried out to
know the awareness regarding Web 2.0 tools like blogs,
wikipedia, RSS feed, social networks, podcasting, and
others (SNS, mashup). It is observed that all of the

(36.96 %) is most popular among library professionals
followed by My Yahoo (27.17 %).

Whilst among respondents 27.17 per cent read blogs of
others. Whereas the population of library professionals is
less who have their own blogs (13.04 %) (Table 8).

A question was posed to explore which particular
sharing sites (video, photo, book, movie, music, etc.) the
library professionals are using in their personal life. Table
7 depicts the results and analysis shows that facebook
(100 %) is most popular among the library professionals
followed by orkut (48.91 %). The respondents were asked
to indicate whether they use blogs application in their
personal work. It is analysed that of the population of
library professionals of all the participated engineering
colleges’ majority of them add posts to blogs (33.69 %).

The respondents were asked to indicate whether they
use wikis application in their personal work. On analysis it
was found that of the population of library professionals of
all the participated engineering colleges’ majority of
library professionals read entries from Wikipedia (14.13
%) (Table 9). Another question was sought to ascertain
the benefits of Web 2.0. The analysis shows that all the
respondents belonging to the concerned colleges
selected; support innovative teaching methods, peer-topeer learning, creation of personal learning environment,

Regarding query about services like instant
messaging (IM), apparently there was some confusion of
the terminology IM and virtual chat reference service.
None college libraries used the term of instant chat
reference service and do not provide other Web 2.0
services. The libraries should provide such services to
improve the standard and quality.
Regarding query about training of Web 2.0 in libraries,
SMS services provided, none of the respondents
indicated that their library or college provides training for
Web 2.0. Libraries should provide training on Web 2.0
technology, through a one-hour seminar or as part of a
literature search course. Library professionals in this
study were asked about the satisfaction (with options
‘satisfied’, moderatively satisfied’, ‘dissatisfied’, and no
comments) with current usage of Web 2.0 tools, which is
a very important variable to investigate user behaviour. All
the respondents colleges were ‘satisfied’ with current
usage of Web 2.0 tools at their workplaces.

6. CONCLUSIONS
For centuries, social and technological changes have
been affecting every profession. During last two decades
rapid technological development has affected library
services as well. Specifically, for the last five years, Web
2.0 technologies have significant impact on the higher
education sector as well on the libraries all over
world12,13.This research is aimed to gain a picture of Web
2.0 technologies currently being used by library
professionals in engineering college’s library and in their
personal life at Western Uttar Pradesh of India. Only a
minority of library professionals are using Web 2.0 to
communicate with students. Web 2.0 can generate twoway communications and that this can genuinely make
the library service more students driven, more immediate
and more responsive to student needs. This research
indicates that library professionals appreciate learning
experiences where new technologies add value to
existing practice, and enhance the library services. They
444

take Web 2.0 as a part of their daily lives, and would like
to see it integrated into library services only if it enriches
their learning experience. The respondents having
excellent skills of internet usage were more inclined
toward adoption of Web 2.0 in their personal life. As
academic libraries strive to reposition themselves in the
digital environment and try to reconfigure their role, the
librarians experiment the use of social tools of the Web
2.0 to advocate, promote, and raise awareness about
library collections and services.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the findings of this study, the following
recommendations should be considered to adopt Web 2.0
technologies:
(i)

The LIS professionals in the country should be
encouraged toward adoption of Web 2.0 technologies
in the library.

(ii) Libraries provide systematic training for staff on Web
2.0 to alleviate their anxiety over technology.
(iii) To explore the factors affecting toward adoption of
Web 2.0 technologies in libraries, a comprehensive
study should be conducted on the country level.
