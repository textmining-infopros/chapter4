 The paper analise that the Dewey Decimal Classifcation (DDC) is the most popular library classifcation  in the world. It states its use in 2 lac libraries, information centres and many national libraries in the world.  Its’ translations exist in more than 30 major languages. It is being used in organising and searching the  web and databases. The paper reviews the new features and changes in the fve consecutive editions  of  the  DDC  since  its  19th   ed.  (1979)  to  the  current  one  23 
rd (2011).  It  explains  the  management  and  tools like the ESS4.0 for revising the DDC. The paper fnds the role of the OCLC and the DC Editorial  Policy Committee (DCEPC) and the European Dewey Users Group (EDUG) in keeping the DDC update,  relevant and remain connected with the users all over the world. It explains its various print and electronic  versions, namely, Full edition in 4 volumes, Abridged Dewey in one volume, and its electronic editions  since 1993 such as the Electronic Dewey, Dewey for Windows (DfW) and now the WebDewey and the  Dewey  database. The  paper  explains  the  organised  and  continued  efforts  of  the  OCLC  to  keep  DDC  popular and relevant to the use in libraries in the IT environment. It states the offcial efforts to make it  a truly international classifcation by reducing the Western and Christian bias and make it more faceted  
with every edition.

1.  IntroDuctIon 
The  DDC,  one  of  the  big  three  classifications  is  the  most  popular  of  all  the  library  classification  systems.  It  is  used  in  2,00,000  libraries  in  135  counties  including  national  bibliographies  of  60  countries,  and  has  been  translated  in  over  30  languages. It has secured and retained this position  partially because of its well-defined revision policy,  sound  revision  machinery  and  proactive  marketing  network.  First  revised  in  1885,  it  has  constantly  and  regularly  been  revised.  Revision  has  been  described as a double-edged sword which cuts both  ways. Though essential for survival, too much of it  may  be  killing  and  dangerous  to  its  popularity  and  atrocious  for  its  users.  So  a  revision  policy  has  to  be carefully formulated, and has to make a delicate  balance between change and stability. A new edition  incorporates  new  topics  at  appropriate  places  that  have  emerged  since  the  previous  edition,  and  deletes  some  of  the  obsolete  subjects.  But  as  an  equally  important  task,  it  relocates  some  topics  to  better deemed places in view of changed structure  of  knowledge  or  to  rectify  earlier  mistakes.  Many

subjects are expanded in details. In addition, advantage  is  taken  to  apply  new  classificatory  techniques  in  improving the system. Edition by edition the system  is  becoming  more  and  more  faceted,  user-friendly,  and  better  technically  and  intellectually. 
1.1 revision  Procedure 
To  carry  out  the  revision  there  is  a  full-time  editorial  team  headed  by  the  (chief)  editor  of  the  DDC.  The  editorial  office  is  located  in  the  Dewey  Section of the Library of Congress, Washington, DC,  USA since 1953. This section applies DDC numbers  to  more  than  one  lakh  new  but  select  books  every  year  procured  in  the  Library  of  Congress. There  is  ten-member  Decimal  Classification  Editorial  Policy  Committee  (DCEPC)  headed  by  a  chairperson  to  advise  the  editors  on  the  kind  and  extent  of  revision. This is a broadbased international committee  appointed jointly by the American Library Association  (ALA) and the OCLC the publisher of the DDC. The  Committee  has  representatives  from  Canada,  the  UK, Australia, South Africa and from every sector of  the  US  library  profession.  It  is  an  apex  committee

which  minutely  advises  and  oversees  the  editing  including changes and innovations in the system. Its  decisions are executed by the chief editor and his/ her  team  of  assistant  editors  who  have  their  office  in the Library of Congress, Washington, DC. Its new  editions  are  published  at  an  interval  ranging  from  7  to  10  years  by  its  exclusive  publisher  the  Forest  Press  till  recently  located  at  Albany,  New york.  It  has now moved its office to OCLC headquarters at  Dublin, Ohio. It is headed by an Executive Director,  who  is  a  vice-president  of  the  OCLC.  The  Forest  Press  is  now  retired  since  2003. 
1.2  communication  and  Incorporation  of  
changes 
Revision  of  the  DDC  is  a  continuous  process.  After deliberations and discussions when the changes  or additions are approved by the DCEPC these are  announced  in  an  irregular  newsletter,  named  DC&.  It  means  DC  AND  (i.e.,  DC  Additions,  Notes  and  Decisions)  which  is  mailed  free  to  all  purchasers  of  a  DDC  edition.  Since  1997  DD&  in  traditional  print form has been discontinued and this newsletter  is  now  available  on  the  Dewey  homepage  on  the  internet at http:www.oclc.org. The Dewey homepage  is  updated  on  the  first  of  every  month.  Therefore,  now the DDC users have always an updated DDC.  In  addition,  since  1993  the  DDC  is  also  available  in  CD-ROM  format  which  is  published  every  year  with  new  revisions.  However,  implementation  of  changes  in  library  is  not  as  easy,  and  most  of  the  librarians  are  scared  of  it  and  some  hate  doing  it;  some  avoid  implementing  them  on  one  pretext  and  the  other.  Only  a  few  libraries  implement  the  new  changes;  rest  continues  with  the  edition  once  adopted. Bibliographies and new libraries, however,  use  the  latest  version. 
1.3 salient  Features  of  DDc-19  (1979) 
The 19th   edition  of  the  DDC  published  in  1979  was  the  last  edition  edited  by  able  and  famous  editor  Benjamin  A.  Custer  (1912-1997),  who  first  edited DDC-16 (1958). The DDC-19 (1979) obviously  carried forward the trends of the last three decades,  though it did not bring up as many changes as were  seen  in  the  DDC-18  (1971).  The  major  revision  (phoenix  schedule)  was  the  new  schedule  of  301- 307  Sociology.  In  1982  a  more  detailed  version  of  301-307  Sociology  was  issued  separately  as  an  independent booklet. Most of the other changes were  also  in  the  main  class  300  Social  Sciences.  The  329  Practical  Politics  was  merged  at  324  to  form  quite  a  new  number,  i.e.,  324  Political  Process. 1.4   c hanges  in tables 
There  were  some  changes  in  the  standards  subdivisions especially in discontinuation of the ss-08;  and an extremely useful Table of Precedence given  
278 
at  the  beginning  of  Table  1.  Table  of  precedence  provides standard guidance in case of choice between  two  standard  subdivisions.  There  was  a  general  17  %  increase  in  the  Area  Table  (Table  2).  As  a  major change the area number of the UK as a whole  was  shifted  to  41  from  42.  In  fact  this  change  had  been  in  force  since  1974. 
1.4.1  DDC  Manual 
  A  landmark  for  the  DDC  practice  and  standardisation  came  in  1982  with  the  publication  by the Forest Press the ‘Manual on the Use of the  Dewey Decimal Classification’, Edition 19 prepared  by John P. Comaromi and his team. It was a result  of a long survey of the use of DDC in North America  conducted by John Comaromi in 1975. The Manual  explains  the  DDC  perceptions  and  practices  of  staff  of  the  Dewey  Division  of  Library  of  Congress  in  applying  and  interpreting  the  DDC  numbers.  It  has  made  possible  the  uniform  application  of  DDC  throughout  the  world  in  conformity  with  the  official  use.  It  provides  guidance  for  classifying  in  difficult  areas,  and  distinguishes  one  number  from  other  related  number.  In  nutshell,  the  Manual  is  a  blue  book  on  the  DDC  numbers  interpretation  and  application  policies.  With  many  maps,  flow  charts  and  detailed  point  by  point  elaborations,  it  is  a  handy  guide  for  thr,  DDC  classifiers  for  uniformity  of  applications  of  the  DDC.  Due  to  its  success  it  has  been  incorporated  in  the  system  since  the  DDC-20  (1989). 
1.4.2  Computerisation 
  DDC-19  was  published  for  the  first  time  through computerised photocomposition. Later from  the electronic tapes many path breaking experimental  studies were conducted by Karen Markey Drabenstott  to study the use of' classification (DDC in particular)  in online searches and retrieval. In 1984 from these  tapes  a  computerised  Editorial  Support  System  (ESS)  was  developed  by  Inforonics  Inc.,  for  the  Forest  Press.  It  started  the  hitech  era  for  the  classification. 
1.4.3  Relative  index 
   The relative index continued to be complicated.  The  only  exception  was  that  the  bold  typeface  for  entries  that  were  subdivided  in  the  schedules  was  eliminated. 
2. DDc-20  (1989) 
The 20th  edition (1989) brought in many changes  which  proved  to  be  trend  setters.  It  was  edited  by  a  new  editor,  Dr  John  P.  Comaromi  (1937- 1991), a brilliant academician, who had a long, time  association  with  DDC  in  various  capacities.  Since  July 1988 ownership of the Forest Press has been  transferred to the OCLC, Dublin, Ohio which started

th

rd 
 E DITION  (2011)  OF  D EWEy DECIMAL  C LASSIFICATION 
a new era in the development of new DC products,  marketing, research and popularity of the DDC. The  system was published for the first time in 4-volumes  running to 3383 pages compared to 3361 pages in  3  volumes  of  the  DDC-19.  Splitting  the  schedules  into  two  volumes  eased  the  classifiers. 
2.1  Editorial  support  system 
Edition  20  was  first  to  be  produced  by  an  online  Editorial  Support  System  (ESS)  installed  by  a  private  company  Inforonics,  Inc  in  1984  in  the  Decimal  Classification  Division  of  the  Library  of  Congress.  It  is  a  database  of  the  entire  contents  of  the  DDC  system  and  is  used  to  produce  future  editions  and  a  variety  of  products.  It  has  almost  eliminated the manual/clerical labour in editing and  has  reduced  the  production  period  to  six  months  from  the  earlier  2  years. 
2.2  new  changes 
Dr  Comaromi  was  appointed  new  editor  in  1980. He had vast knowledge of use of the DDC in  North American  libraries.  He  introduced  many  new  changes  especially  to  make  the  DDC-20  simple,  smart and uptodate. It contained many more changes  as  compared  to  the  previous  two  editions.  Though  Comaromi believed in drastic changes to keep pace  with growing 163 Knowledge, he stuck a diplomatic  balance  between  stability  and  change.  By  way  of  a  major  development  a  completely  new  schedule  for 780 Music was incorporated. It had been under  revision for the last decade by outside experts.  The  schedule  is  not  only  modern  in  contents  but  also  more  faceted  with  transparent  facet  structure. This  edition  also  incorporated  004-006  Data  Processing  and  Computer  Science,  which  was  earlier  issued  as a ‘separate’ between DDC-9 and DDC-20. Minor  changes took place in subjects like Christian Religion,  Television, Adult Education, Electronics, Civil Rights,   Gymnastics  and  Civil history. 
2.2.1  Change  in  Tables 
  The  new  Area  table  reflected  changes  in  administrative and political setup of different countries  and their units. Table 3 was further refined, modified  and split into three sub-tables: T3A, T3B and T3C.  T3C  is  used  on  instructions  from  Table  3B  or  in  808-809 in the Schedules. It has made its application  more  easy  direct  and  simplified. 
2.3  Electronic  Version 
A  major  achievement  of  DDC-20  had  been  its  electronic  version  issued  in  1993  on  CD-ROM  titled,  ‘Electronic  Dewey’.  It  contained  the  DDC-20  Schedules,  Tables,  Index  and  Manual  as,  well  as  the  amendments  and  updatings  made  in  the  DDC-20  since  its  publication  in  1989.  The  disc  can  be  used  with  a  standalone  microcomputer.  A  highly  value-added  version  the  Electronic  Dewey  
could  be  searched  by  words  or  phrases,  numbers,  index terms and Boolean operations. Captions could  be  browsed  and  hierarchies  could  be  displayed.  An  entry  also  showed  frequently-used  LC  subject  headings associated with a Dewey number, alongwith  a  sample  bibliographic  record.  It  enabled  users  to  classify materials quickly and efficiently. It was the  first CD-ROM version available commercially of any  library  classification  system. 
2.4  simplification  Movement 
Comaromi  will  be  remembered  for  his  fruitful  efforts  towards  simplification  and  ease  of  use  of  the DDC. Format and presentation of the DDC text  was  improved  in  elegance  and  operation  as: • Three  main  summaries  were  relocated  to  the  
second  volume. 
• Throughout the schedules and tables many more  
multilevel summaries were introduced especially  
in  dense  schedules  such  as  370  Education,  
620  Engineering  and  630 Agriculture,  and  also  
for  Area  tables  of  Europe  and  North  America.  
A  multilevel  summary  is  an  outline  of  a  class  
at  some  lower  level,  e.g.,  outline  of  631.11. A  
multilevel  summary  allows  to  view  the  entire  
class  at  one  glance,  i.e.,  provides  a  bird's  eye  
view  of  that  class.  It  is  time  saving  in  locating  
a  number  without  much  scanning  and  flipping  
of  the  schedules  pages.  It  also  saves  the  
schedules  from  physical  wear  and  tear. 
• Under  each  entry  detailed  definitional  and  
instructional  notes  have  been  provided. 
• Centered  heading  as  indicated  typographically  
by  the  symbol  “>”  in  the  number  column. • Optional  numbers  were  given  in  parenthesis,  
e.g.,  (828.9935). 
• Manual on the use of DDC (Forest Press, 1982)  
was incorporated in the 4th  volume (pp. 731-961).  
Schedules, and tables quite frequently referred  
back  to  the  Manual  for  further  clarification  and  
elaboration. 
• As another significant innovation, ‘Editor's Introduction’  
was  simplified  and  made  simple  and  brief.  It  
was  mentioned:  "The  introduction  is  written  
primarily for the novice or beginning classifiers,  
although the experienced classifiers may benefit  
from reviewing its contents" (Introduction, Sec.  
1.1).  It  is  comparatively  easy  to  comprehend. 
2.5  Index 
Another milestone change occurred in simplifying  and trimming the index. It had then been substantially  reduced to 730 pages from 1216 of DDC-19. This had  been  accomplished  without  impairing  its  efficiency.  All  the  ‘See’  references  had  been  replaced  by  direct  entries.  Synthesised  numbers  were  omitted  
279 

========3========

DJLIT,  VOL.  33,  NO.  4, JULy  2013 
with  a  few  exception.  Only  terms  of  the  schedules  and  tables  were  indexed.  Users’  convenience  and  efficiency  were  the  two  important  achievements  of  the  DDC-20.  It  was  clear,  usable,  and  a  trend  setting  edition  which  was  well  received  by  the  library  world. 
3.  DEWEY-21  (1996) 
The  21st   edition  was  released  in  July  1996,  for  the  first  time,  simultaneously  both  in  traditional  print  (in  4  volumes)  and  CD-ROM  forms.  Latter  is  known as Dewey for Windows (Dfw). Availability of  DDC-20 on CD-ROM facilitated and accelerated the  publication of the new edition. By now the relationship  of  IT  and  DDC  has  crossed  the  teething  trouble  to  enter  a  mature  and  fruitful  era. As  with  the  earlier  edition  the  editorial  work  for  the  DDC-21  was  also  done  on  the  ESS,  now  a  UNIX-based  system.  As  another  innovation,  members  of  the  DCEPC  now  hold  electronic  meetings  via  the  Dewey  listserve  on  the  internet.  DC&  in  the  print  form  has  been  discontinued  and,  instead,  is  now  available  on  the  internet  at  http://www.oclc.  org/fp.  The  Dewey  home  page  also  includes  the  OCLC  Forest  Press  catalogue, Dewey News, and the 'hot' classification  topics  and  internet  addresses  of  online  catalogues  using  Dewey.  The  text  in  4  volumes  has  been  edited  by  a  new  editor  Ms.  Joan  S.  Mitchell  who  was  appointed  Chief  Editor  in  1993.  Ms  Mitchell,  the  9th  editor  since  Dewey  has  been  associated  with  the  Dewey  Organisation  since  1985.  She  is  an  expert  in  information  technology. 
3.1  structure  of  DDc-21 
The  DDC-21  has  the  following  bibliographic  details: 
‘Dewey, Melvil Dewey Decimal Classification and  Relative  Index’  devised  by  Melvil  Dewey.  Ed.  21/ edited by Joan S. Mitchell, Julianne Beall, Winton E.  Matthews, Jr. and Gregory R. New. Forest Press, a  Division  of  OCLC  Online  Computer  Library  Centre,  Inc.  Albany,  N.y.:  1996,  4  Vols.  ISBN  0-910568- 50-4. 
Volume  1:    Prefatory  material,  Editor's  introduction 
      Glossary,  Tables  1-7  and  information 
      on  the  changes  in  the  new  edition. 
Volume  2:    Schedules  000-599 
Volume  3:    Schedules  600-999 
Volume  4:    Relative  index,  Manual 
The 4 volumes spread over to 4126 pages have  been  divided  into  nine  sections  marked A/I. 3.2  user's  convenience 
The DDC-21 furthers on all aspects the line set  
like  notes  are  also  appended  to  entries  in  the  schedules. Some new types of notes and theoretical  concepts  have  also  been  introduced. 
3.3  changes  in  schedules 
The  changes  in  the  DDC-21  are  numerous  and  far  reaching  in  form  of  additions,  expansion,  relocations, deletions, change of headings, and newly  added  notes.  The  major  new  schedules  are  for: 
296      350-354  368      370      560-570  
Judaism  and  297  Islam Public Administration Insurance 
Education 
Life  Sciences 
Some  select  revisions  have  been  made  in: 
004-006  Data  Processing 
342-349  Branches  of  Laws 
355      Military  Science 
362-363  Social  Problems 
420-490  Specific  Languages 
636      Animal  Husbandry 
790      Theatre 
810-890  Literatures  of  Specific 
        Languages 
940-990  General history of the Modern  
        World.  
As an important change in 370 Education, 376  Education  of  women  and  377  Schools  of  religions  have  been  made  subdivisions  of  371  Education,  whereas  distance  education  has  been  expanded. 3.3.1  Reduction  of  Bias 
    A  commendable  effort  has  been  to  reduce  Christian  bias  in  religion  by  shifting  Christian  religion  from  200  to  220/289.  200-219  is  now  comprehensive religion. Similarly, US bias has been  reduced in wording and structure in 350-354 Public  Administration. It is a big step towards reduction of  Western  and  Christian  bias  and  an  effective  move  towards  internationalisation. 
3.3.2  Changes  in  Tables 
   Select changes in the auxiliary Tables in volume  1  are  not  less  either.  Regularisation  of  standard  subdivisions has been carried on bit further. Foremost  example  is  in  370  Education  where  irregular  use  of  standard  subdivision  has  been  replaced  by  the  regular use of T1-07. There has been a regularisation  of  the  use  of  standard  subdivisions  at  370.7  and  elsewhere in the schedules and related adjustments  in  TI-071.  This  brings  uniformity  and  makes  the  notation  mnemonic  and  faceted.  But  still  more  
by  the  previous  (Ed.  20)  with  emphasis  on  user's remains to be done, e.g., there is inconsistency as: 
convenience  and  modernisations.  Entries  are  clear  with copious notes. Editor's Introduction is brief and  simple  with  improved  captions.  Many  brief  manual

 E DITION  (2011)  OF  D EWEy DECIMAL  C LASSIFICATION 
Area table has many significant changes especially  in  the  area  for  47  Russia,  499  Bulgaria,  Area  numbers  for  news  and  other  geopolitical  changes  have  been  incorporated.  There  are  minor  changes  in  other  tables. 
3.3.3  Transparent  Facet  Structure 
    The  completely  revised  schedules  (the  new  
adopted  in  DDC-16/19)  not  only  incorporate  new  
seven  tables  arranged  in  word  by  word  order.  Notes in the Manual have also been indexed which  lead  classifiers  to  relevant  discussion.  ‘See  also’  references have been employed to draw attention to  the broader and related terms. It also indicates the  place  for  the  interdisciplinary  works  in  the  subject.  As  in  DDC-20,  ‘See’  references  for  synonymous  
to  reflect  modern  thinking  in  that  profession.  In  
terms have not been used. Instead a term has been  edition  also  avoids  the  term  phoenix  schedule  
indexed  under  all  equivalent  terms.  For  example,  
Birds  and  Aves  both  have  been  indexed.  Under  subjects with details but it also provides opportunity  
Aves  ‘See  also’  reference  leads  to  Birds  and  their  to rectify the order of classes and the facet structure  
all  related  aspects. 
In DDC-21 in accordance with other subjects indexing  
and  more  faceted.  For  good  or  bad  the  DDC- 21  abounds  in  options  in  facet  formula  for  local  emphasis.  For  example,  in  560-590  Life  Sciences,  the  major  taxonomic  subdivisions  have  remained  the  same,  but  the  order  of  facets  has  changed  from Entity-Process to Process-Entity. Biochemistry  from  574.19  has  been  raised  to  the  status  of  a  section at 572 with ample details and many facets.  This  is  keeping  in  view  the  current  status  of  the  subject.  In  350-354  Public Administration  structure  has been improved by reducing US bias. The facet  order  has  been  changed  from  Jurisdiction  Topic  to  Topic-Jurisdiction.  There  is  also  an  option  here  to  bring together all topics of Public Administration by  area. There are many facet indicators used through  many  internal  tables.  Number  building  has  been  simplified.  For  example: 
(Public) Administration  of  Justice  in  India 
353.4  +  09  (T1)  +  54  (T2)  =  353.40954  
        (Option A,  Vol.  2,  p.  601) 
or 
351  +  54  (T2)  +  0  (Facet  indicator)  +  34  
        (from  353.4)  =  351.54034 
It  simply  means  that  the  topics  of  Public  administration can be collocated by country/place or  by topic. In Public administration, the new numbers  are  not  only  shorter  but  also  do  away  with  dual  provision  of  the  DDC-20,  e.g.: 
topic     Ed  20     Ed  21 
Abuse  of  power 351.991 353.46 
352.002 
the  DDC-21  the  new  schedules  have  transparent  
tools such as Sears List of Subject Headings and the  facet  structure.  It  means  the  DDC  is  getting  more

Relative  index  now  of  895  pages  has  been  increased, by 150 pages with the addition of many  new terms and headings. The index includes terms  in the headings, and most terms in notes appended  to  entries  in  the  schedules,  and  terms  in  all  the  
i.e.,  direct  and  natural  form  of  phrasal  headings  have  been  used.  Personal  and  geographic  names  have  been  indexed  on AACR¬2  specifications.  For  instance, entry is Civil Engineering, not Engineering,  Civil;  Commercial  art,  not Art,  Commercial. 
Some synthesised numbers have been restored in  the index-based on literary warrants. It incorporates  more  terms  to  make  it  more  hospitable  to  non-US  users. 
Some  concepts  and  terms  implied  and  some  terms  obtainable  through  number  building  having  sufficient  literary  warrant  have  also  been  included  in  the  index.  Apart  from  physiogeographic  names  and  features,  countries  and  their  provinces  have  also been included in the index. The US geographic  details  are  upto  the  county-level.  Some  historical  events,  personalities,  kings,  queens,  eras,  names  of  (literary/social/political)  movements  have  also  been  included  in  the  index.  The  index  of  DDC-21  has  best  of  both  the  two  previous  indexes,  i.e.,  it  has  simplicity  of  DDC-20  and  exhaustiveness  of  DDC-19. 
3.5 Abridged  DDc-13  (1997) 
First published in 1894 an abridged edition has  shorter  numbers  (normally  up  to  two  digits  beyond  the  dot)  which  are  easy  to  remember  and  can  be  easily  written  on  the  spine  of  the  document  for  shelving. Besides this, it is less expensive. In brief,  it  is  efficient  for  a  collection  upto  20,000  books  of  a school or small public library, and makes a handy  tool  for  teaching  DDC.  It  is  also  used  in  subject  headings  for  children. 
Abridged  DDC-13  comprising  a  total  of  1026  pages  has  the  following  major  parts:  
(a) Prefatory  material  (pp.  i-iii),  (b) Four  tables  (pp.  1-57),  and (c) Schedules  (pp.  59-651). 
It  is  a  true  abridgement  of  the  DDC-21  (1996)  which  has  been  printed  from  a  database  prepared  at  the  Library  of  Congress  by  a  computer-assisted

subdivisions for multidisciplinary topics. Terminology  has been updated to reflect international and current  usage; and number building instructions have been  made explicitly simple. Caption headings have been  improved and made more informative. Notes appended  to  various  entries  have  been  simplified  and  made  more comprehensive. Use of standard subdivisions  has been bit regularised. It helps in better decision  making.  There  is  a  long  term  multi-edition  plan  to  reduce Christian bias. First step has been taken in  this  edition  by  shifting  the  comprehensive  number  for  Christian  religion  to  230  from  200.  In  Public  Administration, and Life Sciences the citation order  of  facets  have  been  reversed  to  reflect  the  shift  in  the current literature of these disciplines. Manual has  been  expanded,  made  more  explicit  and  indexed;  and there are more references to the Manual in the  schedules.  In  brief  the  new  abridged  edition  in  a  single  volume  provides  small  libraries  the  updated  features  of  the  unabridged  DDC-21  with  ease  and  at  a  much  lower  price. 
3.6  Dewey  for  Windows  (DfW) 
The  e-version  of  DDC-21,  named  ‘Dewey  for  Windows  (DfW)’  was  released  simultaneously  with  the traditional print version in 1996. It is a Microsoft  window based LAN compatible version of the Electronic  Dewey with DDC-21 database. It provides a window  interface  which  is  different  from  the  DOS  version  of DDC-20 (Electronic Dewey 1993). Search engine  in  both  the  cases  remains    the  same.  Obviously,  it  requires  a  micro  computer  with  windows  version  3.10  or  higher,  a  486-based  PC  or  higher  with  a  minimum of 8 MB of memory, and a colour monitor  with  CD-ROM  drive.  The  DfW  database  began  as  a  database  in  the  ESS  at  the  Library  of  Congress.  The ESS format is though different from the MARC  format  yet  there  are  many  similarities  between  the  two.  The  tapes  generated  from  ESS  database  are  used to produce both the print and CD-ROM format  as well as abridged DDC. DfW is updated between  editions  by  issuing  a  new  CD  which  incorporates  changes announced in DC& which is now published  only  on  the  internet. 
Unlike  the  print  editions  the  Dewey  on  CD  is  not  constrained  by  the  physical  size  and  space.  • The  database  includes  all  built  numbers  from  the  
•

The LC subjects headings have been added to  the each class number by statistical matching. These  headings  provide  additional  terms  for  searching.  It  is  an  additional  help  for  libraries  using  LCSH  for  subject  headings,  and  a  source  of  additional  terms for other DfW users. There are some in-built  readymade numbers. Keyword access is helpful for  finding  these  already-built  numbers.  Future  edition  may  contain  many  more  such  built-in  numbers.  In  DfW movement of upward and downward hierarchies  is possible by highlighting and clicking. For interface,  it uses single function windows. If a number or term  is  dragged  and  dropped  into  a  search  window,  the  search  for  number  or  the  term  will  begin.  For  full- record display of a number including caption notes,  relative index entries and associated LCSH headings  of  a  number  that  Dewey  number  is  dragged  and  dropped.  If  the  term  is  dragged  and  dropped  into  an  index    window  set  for  the  relative  index,  the  relevant part of the Relative index will be displayed  looking  like  that  of  the  printed  relative  index. 
The windows are arranged in a tiled fashion to  facilitate dragging  and dropping. There are standard  as  well  as  customisable  views  for  the  user  to  set.  The  standard  views  are: 
(a) Search view—search window and DDC number  
window 
(b) Browse view—search window, DDC pages window  
and  DDC  number  window 
(c) Scanview—Index  window,  search  window,  and  
DDC  number  window 
(d) Summary view—DDC summary window, search  
window, DDC pages window, and DDC number  
window. 
It also provides facility to create, i.e., customise  users’  own  views  to  configure  the  windows  to  suit  ones  own  approach.  The  standard  views  are  each  described in the Dewey for Windows reference card.  The print version of DDC is used in different ways,  i.e.,  either  through  the  schedules  or  through  the  index, so there are different ways to use DfW. Mary  Mortimer  explains  that  in  any  view  one  can: • Maximise  any  window  to  see  a  larger  display 
Choose  display  to  see  appropriate  LCSh 
Choose  bibliographic  record  to  see  a  sample

It has an augmented index with natural language  terms  from  other  thesauri  to  provide  an  enhanced  access.  Some  of  the  important  advantages  of  DfW  over  the  traditional  print  version  are: 
(a) Keyword  access  to  the  entire  print  DDC-21 (b) Additional  terms  and  subject  headings  for  
search 
(c)   h ierarchic  display 
(d) Standard  and  formulable  view 
(e) Dragging  and  dropping  of  numbers  and

It  also  remains  uptodate  without  any  manual  addition  from  the  DC&  as  a  new  version  is  issued  annually. However the basic principles and number  building techniques are the same. Future e-versions  may provide some built-in expert system for automatic  synthesis  of  numbers  wherever  required.  Many  surprising  features  may  be  in  store  in  the  near  future  including  the  one  Dewey  without  notation. 3.6.1  Version  2.00  Features

Custer  was  instrumental  in  not  only  resuscitating   
but also putting DDC back on the path of progress.  his  able  successor  Dr  John  P.  Comaromi  (1937- 1991) who edited the 20th  edition (1989) ushered in  a  period  of  simplification  and  consolidation.  Since  the acquisition of the Forest Press by the OCLC in  1988  a  lot  more  research  input  goes  into  making a  new  edition  of  the  DDC.  If  the  DDC-21  (1996)

was  a  product  of  high  IT,  if  can  safely  be  termed  as child of network technology. It is the first edition  produced in the web environment. Editors and policy  makers got constant feedback and suggestions via  the  Internet  to  add  new  features  and  to  achieve  accuracy  and  efficiency.  To  be  abreast  of  current  developments  on  knowledge  practices  the  editors  relied on the internet and e-databases for new topics  and terms. The DCEPC members also communicated  via  the  Internet.

4.3  new  Features 
The  new  edition,  as  expected,  represents  the  current thinking in knowledge mapping and emergence  of new terminology. Progress made in understanding  the  user  approaches  in  accessing  information;  and  users  expectations  from  the  DDC  have  been  the  focus of this new edition. The revision process has  received  considerable  input  from  a  commissioned  survey  of  the  DDC  users  in  USA,  Canada,  UK

It  is  a  second  edition  edited  in  a  row  by  Joan  S.  Mitchell  who  took  over  as  editor  in  1993.  It  carries  forward  the  policies  and  improvements  started  earlier  in  DDC-21  especially  its  onslaught  on the Christian and Western cultural (WASP) bias  in  the  schedules  and  tables.  Two  editions  plan  for  reducing  the  Christian  bias  in  200  Religion  started  in  DDC-21  has  now  been  completed  with  some  additional  provisions  in  296  and  297. 
4.2  organisation  of  the  system 
The  print  DDC-22  in  four  volumes  containing  4076  pages  in  all  has  been  divided  into  eleven  sections  marked A/K  as  follows: 
Volume 1 Sections A/G 
A xi-xxxvi Prefatory text, notes and new features 
B xxxvii-1xiii Introduction to the system of the DDC. It describes  
the  theory  and  practical  procedure  for  number  
building.  In  nutshell  it  is  concise  operational

theory and practice of the DDC 
D 1xxv-1xxvii Index to the terms and concepts in sections A/C. E 1-181 Manual:  A  guide  to  the  interpretation  and  
comprehension of some ambiguous numbers; to

and  supervising  committee,  and  an  apex  body  continued  to  associate  outside  experts,  institutions  and associations for suggestions on some national  and  cultural  issues  and  to  reduce  inherent  biases.  It  is  a  healthy  trend  to  involve  inter  alia  experts  from  other  knowledge  organisation  systems,  e.g.,  Professor I.C. McIlwaine (UDC) and Dr Joseph Miller  (Sears  List)  in  the  revision  and  review  process.  International  survey  has  led  to  improvement  in  geographic areas, law, political systems and parties,  languages,  literatures  and  historical  periods.  Wide  based cooperation helps the proliferting translation  programmes and in using current terminology. Concern  for users convenience continues – through no new  special  or  users-friendly  device  or  move  has  been  incorporated. Only number of multilevel summaries  has  been  increased  which  facilitate  scanning  and  subsequent  location  of  numbers  without  undue  scurry. Apart from outsourcing revision and advise,  a  few  areas  were  also  pretested  in  some  US  and  foreign  libraries. 
Acquisition  of  the  DDC  by  the  OCLC  in  1988  has  meant  a  great  deal  of  progress  for  the  former.  It has inaugurated an era of research, new products  and  services  and  their  organised  marketing.  The  OCLC  Office  of  Research  had  involved  itself  in  classification research at the beginning of the revision,  especially in the harmonisation of various knowledge  classification systems, mapping of DDC numbers to  subject headings, above all to make DDC amenable  to  organise  electronic  information  of  every  sort.  In  addition to the feedback and expert advice, this edition,  as  usual,  is  based  on  actual  classification  of  three  quarters  of  a  million  current  books  in  the  Decimal  Classification  Division  of  the  LC  since  1996. 
4.4  changes 
The  first  and  noticeable  change  is  with  the  publisher. The Forest Press (incorporated 1932), a  subsidiary of the OCLC, since July 1988, has been

retired and the work has been published directly by  the  OCLC.  It  seemed  something  on  the  way  since  the  retirement  of  Peter  J.  Paulson  and  shifting  of  the Forest Press from Albany to OCLC headquarters  at Dublin, Ohio. The other outstanding change has  been the abrogation of Table 7 Persons. Its contents  have been shifted partially to the standard subdivision  T1-08, and for the rest use of the add from 011-999  has  been  prescribed.  There  are  six  places  in  the  tables  and  12  places  in  the  schedules  where  this  table  was  used.  What  good  this  move  has  done  is  not  clear.  In  fact  it  has  made  number  building  in  some  cases  bit  circuitous,  especially,  while  using  Table 3C. It has also resulted in the reuse of many  DDC-21  numbers  with  new  meanings: 
title DDc-21 
Artworks by scientists 704 + 5 (T7) = 704.5 Ethics of historians 
Collection of English poetry about lawyers821.0080352344 
174.9 + 97 (T7) = 174.997 
However,  some  numbers  remain  the  same,  e.g., Social customs of artists 390.47 (both DDC-21  and  DDC-22).  A  few  numbers  have  also  become  shorter  in  length. 
But certainly there are improvements in the manual  now shifted to volume 1 (pp. 1-182) from the fourth  in DDC-21. Notes in the manual have been shortened  with  removal  of  some  redundant  information,  and  further by dividing them into smaller sections. Some  information  from  the  manual  has  been  transferred  as notes to the respective entries in the schedules  and  tables.  The  Manual  has  always  represented  the  policies  of  the  Decimal  Classification  Division  of the Library of Congress. Now the Schedules and  the  Tables  with  many  notes  do  it.  This  has  helped  prune redundant information. The manual now makes  more clear and easy reading, though it loses some  of  its  authority.  Flow  charts,  built-in  numbers,  and  see also, references are of great help to classifiers  in  achieving  inter-indexer  consistency. 
The  relative  index  of  928  pages  has  33  pages  more than the previous index to include new built-in  numbers and some additional terms. Entry vocabulary  is  widely  based  and  current.  The  index  has  been  beefed  up. 
In compliance with the recommendations of D Elia’s  survey all the works relating to directories of travel  facilities such as hotels, lodges, motels, inns, have  been shifted to 910.46 and to 913/919 whereas 647.94  continues  to  be  in  place  for  hotels  etc.  per  se. 
Unlike  the  previous  editions  (trend  that  started  in  DDC-16)  there  are  no  full  class  or  extensive  revisions (nee’ phoenix schedules) in the DDC-22. But  
routine  revisions  involving  expansions,  reductions,  deletions  and  relocations  are  outlined  here  : 
004-006

Data processing and computer science. New topics have  been accommodated retaining the structure. 
Two  editions  programme  of  removing  Christian  bias  and further expansion of 296 and 297 is now complete.  Contents  of  291Comparative  religion  have  now  been  distributed  to  200-209  with  obviously  brief  numbers,  and more space for expansions. For example, 291 has  been shifted to 200, and so 291.1 becomes 201. There  are more than sixty relocations in religion of which more  than half are from 291 to 201-209. As a result standard  subdivisions  of  200  have  been  shifted  to  200.1-.9.  Advantage for non-Christian religions is obvious. 
DDc-22 
704.08 + 8 (from 088 T1) + 5 (001-999) = 704.0885 174.9 + 90720 (from 907.  201) +2 (T2) =174.9907202 821.008035208834 
340 Law  -  Now  341  international  law  becomes  law  of  
nations  with  new  numbers  for  human  rights  and  inter  
governmental organisations. There are major relocations  
in 341.7 international economic and social laws. 
510 Mathematics  (earlier  completely  revised  in  DDC-18  
(1971)  has  been  substantially  updated.  Numerical  
analysis earlier part of 515 has been upgraded and  
shifted to 518 lying vacant since long. 
543 All aspects of Analytical Chemistry dispersed earlier have  
been converged at 543.1-543.8. 
610 It  has  been  reworded  as  ‘Medicine  and  health’,  and  
medical topics fnd improved indexing. 
640 It  is  now  titled  as  ‘Home  and  family  management’  with  
some topics shifted to 910 travels. 
930-990 The  historical  periods  have  been  updated.  There  are  
about 80 relocaitons here. 
T2 The Area table has been updated by geographic areas,  
historical  periods  and  persons.  There  are  about  280  
relocations in this table alone. 
T3C Table 3C has been revised to provide grouping of topics  
parallel to DDC schedules 
T5 & T6 From T5 by deleting the term ‘Racial’ the table has been  
renamed as ‘National and ethnic groups’. 
These tables have been expanded especially  to make provisions for American native people and  languages. 
However,  all  these  changes  are  not  those  projected  as  slated  changes  for  DDC-22  in  the  DDC-21 (1996), namely, in 520 Astronomy, 355-359  Military  Science,  636-639  Animal  husbandry  and  690  Buildings.  Obviously,  switch  over  to  the  DDC  22  will  put  less  strain  on  libraries. 
minor changes are many. There are more than one  4.5 Abridged  Edition  14

upto  20,000  documents.  Its  web  version  abridged  WebDewey (www.oclc.org/info/abridged14) has been  issued  simultaneously.  WebDewey  is  an  enhanced  version of the Dewey database of terms and numbers  
updating  of  schedules  here  and  there.  The  entire  gamut of changes (as listed on pages xxv-xlii, Vol.1)  fills only 18 pages. “…. expansion and revision have  been preferred to relocation” states the chairperson  
available  in  the  print  edition.  Updated  quarterly  of the DCEPC Ms Caroline Kent (Vol. 1, p. xi.). This  
it  is  only  accessible  via  the  internet  on  annual  subscription  basis.  It  provides  much  more  facilities  including  key  words  navigation. Annotation  feature  allows classifiers to add and share notes about local  classification changes. WebDewey is available within  the  full  OCLC  cataloguing  services  environment.  It  provides many access points with many search and  browse  indexes.  It  makes  the  location  of  Dewey  numbers  an  easy  game. 
DDC-22,  the  first  edition  of  this  millennium  has  kept  pace  with  the  fast  changing  information  environment  to  map  and  organise  squarely  the  big  world  of  knowledge. 
5.  DDc-23  (2011) 
The 23rd  edition of DDC, earlier scheduled to be  published in 2010, was delayed about a year to be  released  in  May  2011  in  the  135th   year  of  its  first  publication in 1876. That small pamphlet published  anonymously very soon puck like girdled the world,  as if it was being awaited. Since then, save a brief  period of 1950s, it has been on an ascending path  of  progress  scaling  new  heights  and  covering  new  territories  at  home  and  abroad.  Though  counted  among  the  big  three  library  classification  system  
time  its  thrust  seems  on  marketing  by  associating  experts  and  users  from  different  libraries  and  countries.  The  present  Chair  of  the  DDC  Editorial  Policy  Committee  (DCEPC)  Caroline  Kent  is  from  the  British  Library.  It  is  for  the  first  time  that  a  non-American is occupying this influential chair. And  it  is  for  the  first  time  that  a  member  (Welna  van  Eeden)  has  been  taken  from  South  Africa  on  the  DCEPC. A very active and strongly organised group  EDUG has been established to promote the use of  DDC  in  Europe,  initiate  translations  in  European  languages  and  the  need  for  research    in  their  interoperability and discuss problems of translation  and  practical  use  in  those  countries.  International  Dewey  Users  Meeting  is  a  group  of  translators,  which  helps  to  improve  its  international  usage.  A  long  list  of  institutions,  individuals  and  groups  who  offered  advice  on  updates  has  been  given  in  acknowledgement. Thirty four individuals have been  acknowledged  for  their  advise  only  on  updating  741.5  Comic  books,  graphic  novels,  fotonovelas,  cartoons,  caricatures,  and  comic  strips. Apart  from  additions  the  new  edition  updates  terminology  “to  improve  currency  and  accessibilities  for  classifier”.  It is asserted that the changes have been motivated  
(the  other  two  being  the  UDC  and  the  LCC;  it  has  by classifiers efficiency and emerging requirements  
surpassed  them  in  its  popularity,  simplicity    and  use. Now it is well entrenched in Europe too where  since  2007  “European  DDC  User  Group”  (EDUG)  
in  machine  representation  and  application  (New  features, p. xxi, vol1).  There are major updates in  Computer Science and Medicine, continued changes  
has  been  officially  established.  Used  in  about  two  in  Religion  and  other  updates  as  needed. There  is  
lac  libraries  in  130  countries  in  six  continents,  and  in  60  national  and  trade  bibliographies,  its  official  translations exist or are under way in more than thirty  major languages of the world. It has found many uses  in  electronic  databases,  organising  and  retrieving  information  on  the  web,  as  an  online  management  tool,  supporting  collection  developments,  mapping  thesauri, and subject schemes. The WorldCat/OCLC,  the  largest  ever  bibliographic  database,  uses  the  DDC.  The  OCLC  since  its  acquisition  of  the  DDC  in  1988  has  given  an  impetus  to  research  in  wider  applications  of  the  DDC  especially  in  the  digital  environment.  The  Knowledge  Organisation  Group  in  OCLC  Research  first  under  Diane  Vizine-Goetz  and  now  Lorcan  Dempsey  have  made  substantial  advances  in  this  area.  From  its  founding  aim  of   arranging  books  and  pamphlets  on  library  shelves  it  is  now  at  the  center  of  research  in  theory  and  practice of knowledge organisation and information  retrieval. 
5.1   c hanges 
The  23rd   edition,  of  all  its  half  a  dozen  recent  editions,  has  come  with  minimum  changes,  i.e.,  
286 
a  bit  of  simplifying  number  building  in  Literature,  an  area  in  which  classifiers  are  often  daunted  by  the  complexity  of  the  instructions.  Some  of  the  proclaimed  changes  are: 
• 004-006 Computer sciences, and parallel provisions  
in  621.39  Computer  engineering,  and  025.04  
Information  storage  and  retrieval. 
• 155  differential  and  development  psychology. • 160  &  513  Logic  and  Symbolic  logic. 
• In 200 Religion updates have been initiated for  
281.9.Orthodox  church  and  297  Islam  which  
will  also  be  continued  in  24th   edition.  There  
are minor changes, addition and terminological  
updating in 300-390 Social sciences, and a few  
more  languages  have  been  added  in  Table  6,  
and  corresponding  additions  in  400  and  800  
schedules  have  been  incorporated.  Of  interest  
to  Indians  may  be  the  following  numbers: • 491.489  Divehi  (Maldivian  language) 
• 491.492  Eastern  hindi  languages 
• 491.496  Pahari  languages.

SATIJA: BRIEFS ON THE  19 
th 
 (1979)  TO ThE  23 
rd 
 E DITION  (2011)  OF  D EWEy DECIMAL  C LASSIFICATION 
Number  for  dialects  (geographic  variations)  of  many languages such as Swedish, Danish, Finnish,  Norwegian,  French,  Italian,  Spanish,  Portuguese  (may be under the influence of EDUG) and Chinese  language  have  been  provided.  New  forms  of  art,  graphic  arts,  graphic  novels,  comic  books,  etc.,  have  been  relocated  from  760  to  740.  Obviously,  history  dates  and  areas  in  schedules  and    tables  have  been  updated. 
5.2   s tructural  changes 
There  are  some  structural  and  terminological  changes of no consequence to the end-user, through  claimed  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  classifiers  and to facilitate machine display and retrieval. The  present  edition  is  now  a  byproduct  of  the  online  web  Dewey  2.0  released  year.  WebDewey  2.0  has  been  prepared  using  4th   generation  of  ESS  (ESS  4.0, 2010). New data format is now based on open  
for  delivering  monthly  updates.  Unwieldy  headings  
South  Asian  countries.  Such  changes  are  both  in  schedules and tables. As another structural change  uneven  span  of  numbers  have  been  balanced  digitally. For example 420.1-428 has been changed  to 420.1-420.9 and 421-428. Similarly, 305.805-.89  is  now  rendered  as  305.805.809  and  305.81.89.  There  were  only  a  few  such  ranges  of  numbers  which  however  had  never  posed  any  challenge  or  problem  even    to  a  very  modest  DDC  classifier,  through  such  transcription  of  number  saved  lot  of  space  on  the  schedules. 
Apart  from  these  there  is  no  major  change  in  schedules or grammar of number building. Nor there  is any innovation. Has the revision process come a   full  circle?!. The  vow  of  integrity  of  numbers  taken  in  1885  seems  to  have  been  observed  only  to  its  best in this edition. In such a situation one wonders,  if  it  was  necessary  to  bring  out  a  new  edition.  
Would  not    a  supplement  of  20-25  pages  have  source MARC21, and formats for Classification and  
served the purpose, instead. In face of continuously  Authority Data. WebDewey is now the chief vehicle  
updated  WebDewey  the  edition  has  lost  its  strict  
boundaries,  even  definition.  Nevertheless,  the  new  for  the  three  main  summaries  have  been  edited  
edition  was  a  necessity,  politically,  and  ritually  to  to  make  them  handy.  For  example  500  Natural  
renew  its  life. 
Sciences and Mathematics appear simply as Science.  600 Technology (Applied Science) appears as only  
science  (politics  and  government)  appear  only  as  
The going popularity, consequent thoughtful and  
grateful dedication to the worldwide Dewey community,  Technology  in  the  first  Summary.  320  Political  
increasing  applications  in  the  digital  information  
environment, and innovative marketing and research  320 Political science in the second summary. Then  
machinery  keep  the  system  at  the  top. 
in the Table 1-08 kinds of person has been renamed  
6.  FuturE trEnDs 
as  Groups  of  People  with  corresponding  changes  in  the  schedules  of  155  Differential  psychology,  305-306  Psychology  of  Social  Groups,  331  Labour  
The  next  edition,  i.e.,  DDC-24  is  likely  to  be  published  in  2018  to  continue  the  changes  hinted  
Economics,  and  of  course  in  T1-092  Biography.  
in  DDC-23. 
Then  wherever  any  subdivision  in  Table  1  is  used  
As evinced by the two previous editions the DDC  
differently  in  the  schedules,  it  is  indicated  so  now,  
is  moving  towards  internationalisation  by  gradually  
otherwise  it  was  quite  obvious.  For  example: • 331.01  Philosophy  and  theory  (of  Labour  
economic) 
• Motivation  01  from  table  as  modified  below • 331.01  Rights  and  position  of  labour • 331.0112  Industrial  democracy. 
Also  there  is  elimination  of  dual  headings.  For  example,  in  the  previous  edition  some  three-digit  number  had  dual  headings,  both  the  headings  separated  by  four  spaces  in  the  scheduled  were  given  as: 
• 532  Fluid  Mechanics        Liquid  Mechanics • 570  Life  Sciences Biology 
• 954  South Asia     India 
All  such  provision  are  replaced  by  a  single  heading,  with  the  other  included  as  the  class  here  note.  Now  532  is  Fluid  Mechanics  with  a  note  to  class Liquid Mechanics here. Similarly, 954 is given  the  heading  “[History  of]  India  and  neighboring  
removing White, Anglo-Saxon and Protestant (WASP)  bias.  Though  able  to  classify  in  complex  situation,  it  is  getting  simple  to  operate.  Facet  structure  is  becoming  transparent  with  a  capability  to  hold  together  many  facets  in  a  single  class  number. 
Since  the  acquisition  of  the  Forest  Press  by  the OCLC-Online Computer Library Center, Dublin,  Ohio,  many  innovative  efforts  have  been  made  to  design  and  market  many  Dewey  products,  such  as  bookmarks,  Dewey  rap  music,  AV  teaching  kit,  Guides to the full, abridged and electronic versions  of  the  DDC,  and  Dewey  posters  and  exclusive  publication  of  three  main  summaries.  OCLC  has  sponsored  pioneering  and  successful  research  to  study the use of classification in online databases.  Most  important  of  all,  research  is  going  on  to  find  wider  applications  of  the  DDC  in  all  sorts  of  information  management.  Three  summaries  of  the  DDC are already being used to organise information  on  the  internet.  For  example,  a  browser  based  on  the  DDC  has  been  developed  for  Net  First,

an  OCLC  database  of  source  accessible  on  the  internet. Some of the question currently addressed  to  the  DDC  are: 
•   h ow can the classification be made more effective  
for  classifiers? 
•   h ow a standard English language classification  
be built that also meets the needs of international  
users? 
•   h ow  to  make  DDC  more  effective  in  OPACs? •   h ow can the classification be made more useful  
for  the  end-users? 
• What can be done to make the DDC constantly  
relevant  in  the  future? 
The  DDC  is  geared  to  become  a  powerful  and  reliable subject access system of the 21st   century-  digital  environment.
