1.  INTRODUCTION 
Higher education system of India is the world’s  third largest in terms of students, next to China and  the United States, offering facility of education and  training  in  almost  all  aspects  of  human  creativity  and intellectual endeavour. Higher education in India  has witnessed an impressive growth over the years.  The number of higher educational institutions (HEIs)  has  increased  from  about  30  universities  and  695  colleges  in  1950-51  to  about  700  universities  (as  of  2012-13)  and  35,000  colleges  (as  of  2011-12)  as  per  UGC  report  2013.  It  is  seen  that  research  is the primary and important function of any higher  education system. In any higher educational institutions  (HEIs) every faculty member is viewed as scientists  and  he  is  always  encouraged  to  build  a  research  team consisting of junior and senior students. In any  educational  institutions  tacit  knowledge  is  present  in individual faculty, researchers, administrators and  decision-makers  which  is  shared  to  the  community  in  the  form  of  published  sources  such  as  books,  journals, course materials, curriculum and research  reports, etc. Knowledge-rich organisations generate  value  from  their  intellectual  and  knowledge-based  assets. 
1.1 About  the  University

Then  again  Sevukan  &  Sharma2,  examined  the  biotechnology  contribution  of  the  selected  central  university  of  India  from  1997-2006.  The  data  used  for  the  study  were  retrieved  from  two  database  sources, namely, PubMed, NCBI (National Centre for  Biotechnology Information); and ISI Web of Science  database—Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE).  They found the growth of literature in biotechnology  has  steadily  increased  from  15  articles  in  1997  to  43 articles in 2006. The BHU was leading from the  front with 42.55 % contribution and there was a trend  towards  collaborative  research  with  two-authored  papers  being  maximum  followed  by  three-authored  papers.  Kumbar3   analysed  1518  research  papers  indexed  in  SCOPUS,  published  by  the  University  of  Mysore  staff  during  1996-2006.  It  were  founded  that  average  citations  per  paper  have  risen  from  1.53  in  1996  to  2.62  in  2003.  The  international  collaborative research activity in the university was  confined  to  select  few  subjects,  such  as  physics  38.4 %, biochemistry 35.6 %, and chemistry 28 %.  In  the  another  bibliometric  assessment  Ahila  &  Nagarajan4,  analysed  a  total  of  22,065  research  articles  published  in  Web  of  Science  and  found  that only 1.41 % articles were contributed by Indian  authors  and  ranking  11th   among  15  countries  in  which highest USA contributed 41.58% followed by  England 10.37 %, Germany 8.21 %, France 6.24 %  Japan 5.02 % and Canada 3.97 %. In collaborative  research  it  has  been  found  that  90  to  95  %  of  the  research  outputs  were  collaborative  in  nature.  Shariatmadari & Mahdi5  explored the existing barriers  to  research  productivity  based  on  faculty  members  perspectives of Islamic Azad University. Baskaran6  analysed the author productivity, discipline-wise and  institution-wise collaboration and ranking of authors  in  research  contribution  of  Alagappa  University  during  1999-2011.  
Majhi  &  Maharana7   assessed  417  papers  published  by  the  Physical  Science  researchers  of  Sambalpur University. They found that three-authored  contributions  ranked  first  forming  123  (29.42  %)  and  single-authored  formed  7.65  %  which  was  very low. Chemistry and physics are the two highly  productive  subjects  contributing  large  quantity  of  publications  than  other  subject  areas  in  physical  science disciplines of Sambalpur University. In another  scientometric study, Gopikuttan & Aswathy8  evaluated  form-wise,  year-wise,  subject-wise  classification  of  published  papers;  most  productive  authors  and  the  most  preferred  journals,  etc.  of  University  of  Kerala  over  a  period  of  13  years  from  2000  to  2012. Balasubramani & Parameswaran9 analysed the  research  productivity  of  Banaras  Hindu  University  indexed  in  Web  of  Science.  They  analysed  the  year-wise productivity in which the highest number  of  research  output  1052  (15.15  %)  was  produced  in  2011  and  the  least  research  output  was  in  
76 
2002  with  306  (4.41  %).  However,  there  was  a  gradual growth of publications during 2003-2011. In  authorship pattern, they analysed that two-authored  papers  ranked  first  in  order  of  sharing  (24.24  %)  of  the  total  research  output.  The  three  authored  papers follow second in the order taking (26.65 %)  of the total research contributions, followed by four  and  five  authored  contributions  sharing  (17.21  %),  (9.55  %)  of  the  total  scientific  research  output  during the study period. Current Science   is  one  of  the  most  preferred  journals  of  the  authors  of  BHU.  The  Institute  of  Technology  leads  in  publications  productivity with 1482 (21.3 %) articles. The authors  of  BHU  have  collaborated  with  the  foreign  authors  for  their  research  work. 
3.  OBJECTIVES 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
• Trace the growth of scholarly publications from  
BHU  during  2004-2013 
• Examine  the  authorship  pattern  and  nature  of  
collaborative  research  
• Gauge the volume of collaboration of BHU with  
national,  international  and  institutional  level • Identify highly preferred journals in which authors  
prefer  to  publish  their  research  articles • Examine the subject distribution of the publications  
from  BHU. 
4.  METHODOLOGY 
The  study  aims  to  evaluate  scholarly  literature  of  Banaras  Hindu  University  published  in  Indian  journals.  The  study  based  on  the  data  retrieved  from  Indian  Citation  Index  (ICI)   online  database,  that is developed by The Knowledge Foundation (a  registered society) with the required support of M/s  Diva  Enterprises  Pvt.  Ltd.  It  is  a  fully  web-based  abstract and citation database covering R&D literatures  across  all  disciplines  published  in  journals/serials  or  in  other  documents  emanating  from  India.  Data  was retrieved on 5 January 2015. The search term  Banaras  Hindu  University  (BHU)  was  used  in  the  institution  search  for  the  time  span  of  2004-2013  in  basic  search  option  of  ICI.  Total  1110  articles  were  downloaded,  from  these  records,  69  records  were  removed  that  were  published  as  editorial,  case  study,  report  and  proceeding  papers.  Thus,  the total number of papers included in the analysis  was  1041.  All  these  1041  papers  were  marked  and  sent  to  e-mail  address  containing  author,  title,  address  and  time  cited  fields  and  then  these  were  analysed  with  the  help  of  Microsoft  Excel.  
4.1  Collaborative  Coefficient  (CC) 
A single step to measure collaborative research  and termed it as collaborative coefficient. This method  

========2========

gautam and mishra: scholarly research trend of banaras hindu university during 2004-2013 
is based on fractional productivity defined by Price    & beaver10. it  is  given  by  following  formula: 
according  to ajiferuke11,  cc   tends  to  zero  as  single-authored  papers  dominate  and  to  1-1/j  as  j-authored papers dominate. this implies that higher  the  value  of  cc,  higher  the  probability  of  multi  or  mega-authored  papers. 
where, j  is the number of  j  authored research papers;  N  is total number of research papers published; and  k   is  the  greatest  number  of  authors  per  paper. 
4.2  Co-Authorship  Index 
to  examine  how  the  pattern  of  co-authorship  index (cai) has changed during the study period, the  following formula of co-authorship index suggested  by garg  &  Padhi12   was  used. 
cai={(Nij/Nio)/(Noj/Noo)}x100 
Nij: number  of  papers  having  j   authors  for  the 
  year  i; 
Nio: total  output  of  year i; 
Noj:  number  of  papers  having  j   authors  for  all 
  years; 
Noo:  total  number  of  papers  for  all  authors  and 
  all  years; 
j   =  1,2,3........ .n 
cai= 100 implies that co -authorship in a particular  year for a particular type of authorship corresponds  to the world average, cai>100 reflects higher than  average  co-authorship  efforts  and  cai<100  lower  than average co-authorship. for calculating cai  the  entire  data  was  divided  into  four  blocks  as  single  authored,  two  authored,  multi-authored  and  mega- authored  publications. 
5.   ANALYSIS AND  INTERPRETATIONS 
5.1  Form-wise  Distribution  of  Publications 
figure  1  shows  literature  from  bhu   has  been  contributed as many as 1041 items during 2004-2013  in  different  indian  journals.  it  could  be  noted  that  out  of  1041  research  output,  88.09  %  of  scientific  publications of bhu  are research article which forms  the  majority  of  the  contributions  and  followed  by  short communication 65 (6.24 %), review article 46  (4.42  %),  and  less  than  1  %  are  research  note,  opinion  papers,  and  special  articles.14  
5.2  Year-wise  Distribution  of  Publications 
figure  1  presents  that  1041  publications  were  included in ici  database during 2004 to 2013 from  bhu.  the  year  in  which  more  than  100  papers  were  published  are  last  four  years  2013  (133),  
Figure 1. Year-wise publications. 
2012  (119),  2011  (146),  and  2010  (125). the  less  productive  years  with  less  than  100  papers  were  in  2009,  2007,  2006,  2005,  and  2004. it  also  seen  that  82  papers  published  in  the  year  2004  from  bhu, which increased gradually. in the early stage  the  quantity  of  scientific  publications  from banaras  hindu  university  were  less  but  increased  gradually  even  though  there  are  ups  and  drop  downs  in  a  few years and 2011 is the year which possess more  number  of  articles. 
5.3  Year-wise  Co-authorship  Index  and  
Collaborative  Coefficient  
table  1  describe  that  out  of  1041  publications,  163 (15.66 %) were contributed by single- authored,  364  (34.96  %)  by  two-authored,  384  (36.89  %)  by  multi-authored  and  130  (12.49  %)  by  mega-  authored. the  authorship  pattern  clearly  shows  that  71  %  literatures  were  contributed  by  multi  and  two-authored. table  1  represents  year  wise  cai   and  cc   of  the  publications  of  bhu   by  single,  two, multi and mega-authored papers. the average  value of cc  is 0.52.  table 1 indicates that in 2004,  2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013, value of cc  was more  than average (0.52). this implies that during these  years,  higher  values  of cai   are  either  for  multi  or  mega-authored papers. table 1 shows that in 2013,  2004,  2010,  2009,  and  2011  had  highest  values  of  cai   for  multi  and  mega-authored  papers  as  during  these  period  scholars  have  paid  more  attention  on  collaborative research. the value for mega-authored  papers is higher in 2013, for multi-authored papers  it  is  higher  in  2004.  year  2005-2008  have  low  values  of  cc   and  higher  values  of  cai   for  single  author  and  year  2005-2009  have  higher  values  of  cai   for  two-authored  papers,  this  indicates  that  during  2005-2008  less  attention  had  been  paid  on  multi  and  mega-authored  researches.  
5.4  Prolific Authors

ICI.  The  actual  scholarly  productivity  of  Banaras  Hindu  University  must  be  very  high  than  we  able  to  measure  because  numbers  of  authors  from  BHU  also  contributed  their  scholarly  publications  in  various  peer-reviewed,  refereed  journals  which  is  not  yet  indexed  in  ICI.  The  results  of  the  study  indicate  that  the  university  has  indeed  progressed  in  terms  of  quantity  of  scholarly  literatures.  The  present  study  suggests  that  research  productivity  of  Banaras  Hindu  University  is  increasing  at  the  average  rate  of  104.1  publications  per  years.  The  trend of co-authored pattern is dominating over the  single authored paper. University has collaboration  with  18  countries  and  28  Indian  states..  Delhi,  Maharastra  and Andhra  Pradesh  are  the  top  three  collaborative  states.  Biological  Science,  Earth  and  Geological  Science,  and  Chemistry  are  the  most  dominating  areas  of  research.  Current  Science,  Indian Journal of Physics and  Journal of Geological  Society of India are the top three journals preferred  by  scientists  of  BHU.
