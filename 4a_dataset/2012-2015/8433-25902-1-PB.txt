1. INTrODUcTION 
Bibliometrics  is  statistical  analysis  of  written  publications, such as books and articles. The most  commonly  used  bibliometric  methods  are  citation  analysis  and  content  analysis1.  Citation  links  or  references  give  the  details  of  earlier  work  on  the  topic  being  discussed.  The  topics  which  are  cited  more  shall  have  greater  impact  on  the  area  of  research.  The  impact  is  measured  based  on  the  number  of  citations  received  by  articles  to  the  number  of  articles  published  by  the  journal  in  two  years. The term bibliometrics was coined in 1969 by  Pritchard . Before 1969 it was either called statistical  bibliography  or  it  had  no  title  at  all.  The  terms  bibliometrics, informetrics, scientometrics, librametrics,  webometrics  are  derived  from  the  term  ‘metrics’.  These  are  the  measuring  techniques  of  knowledge  in library and information science2. Bibliometrics and  scientometrics  are  two  closely  related  approaches  to  measuring  scientific  publications  and  science  in  general, respectively. These two methods are widely  used  for  studying  growth  pattern  of  publications,  citation  analysis,  to  calculate  the  impact  factor  of  a journal title, development of scope and spectrum  of  any  area  of  research,  and  ranking  of  scholarly  output of researchers and institutions and identifying  the  centres  of  excellance  in  academia. 
There  are  famous  laws  of  bibliometric,  i.e.,  (Lokta,  1926)  of  scientific  productivity,  Broadford’s  law  (Broadford,  1934)  of  scattering  and  Zips  law  (Zips,  1949)  on  frequency  of  words.  However,  the  bibliometric  study  is  unique  and  common  to  all  the  subjects  after  sixties3.  Research  has  become  a  collective  effort  in  all  fields.  It  is  seen  that  there  is  consistent  increase  towards  collaboration  in  research  in  various  disciplines.  Scientists  realise  the necessity of collaboration in research in present  era  of  Information  explosion4.

Human  knowledge  has  grown  exponentially  in  the  recent  years  demonstrating  the  technological  breakthroughs  in  every  area  of  science  and  engineering.  This  has  led  to  the  publication  of  literature in considerable volumes. Periodicals have  emerged as main transmitting media for dissipation  of primary information and knowledge. Due to cost  constraints  and  budget  limitations,  it  is  difficult  for  many libraries to procure all the periodicals of their  interest.  Bibliometric  studies  help  the  librarians  to  plan  and  procure  the  periodicals  of  high  demand  and  also  to  indicate  the  fields  of  research  which  need  more  attention  to  the  researchers6,7,8. 
3.   OBJE cTIVES  OF  THE  STUDY 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to  understand  the  following  regarding  IEEE  Transactions: • Year-wise  published  articles

4. LITErATUrE rEVIEW 
The  following  are  some  of  the  relevant  studies  worthy  of  examination.  
Kumar & Moorthy9  carried out bibliometric analysis  of  DESIDOC  Journal  of  Library  and  Information  Technology   during  2001-2010  and  concluded  that  the  number  of  papers  published  increased  after  2006,  and  the  maximum  number  of  papers  were  published in 2008 and 2009. The maximum number  of  single-authored  papers  was  37.6  %  followed  by  two-authored  papers  with  36.9  %.  Alka  Bansal10 extended  the  bibliometric  analysis  to  2012  and  concluded  that  the  maximum  number  of  articles  was  published  in  2012  and  the  maximum  number  of  contributions  has  the  length  of  6-10  pages,  and  majority  of  the  authors  preferred  journals  as  the  source  of  their  citation.

Gupta,11 et al., analysed on the articles published  all  over  the  world  in  the  area  of  the  social  science  research in India during the period 2001-2010. The  annual  Indian  output  average  growth  rate  in  social  science  was  17.66  %,  the  average  citation  impact  per  paper  was  1.53. 
Rao12 et  al., analysed  bibliometric  analysis  of  the  Journal  of  Propulsion  and  Power  during  the  period  1985-2013.  A  total  of  4047  articles  were  published  and  it  is  observed  that  USA  produced  61.24  %,  Japan  6.92  %,  Republic  of  China’  3.8  %,  Germany  3.25  %,  UK  3.03  %  and  India  2.66  %  of  the  total  articles.  
Garg  & Anjana13   examined  authorship  pattern,  average  length  of    articles  in  terms  of  pages,  geographical  distribution  of  articles,  most  prolific  institutions and authors, and citations  earned by the  articles  of Journal  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights. 
C.P Salini14,  et al., analysed organic chemistry  research in India. They compared the Indian output  with  that  of  leading  countries  using  Exergy,  an  indicator  which  combines  quality  and  quantity  of  publications.  They have noted that organic chemistry  research  in  India  during  2004-2013  is  equal  to  the  world average and its growth pattern is positive and  similar  to  worldwide  research  growth. 
Thanuskodi15   studied  the  Journal  of  Social  Sciences.   It  has  published  273  articles  during  the  period  of  study.  The  highest  number  of  articles   appeared in the area of economics. Also, he examined  the  authorship  pattern,  subject-wise  distribution  of  articles, average number of references per articles,  forms  of  documents  cited,  year  wise  distribution  of  cited  journals,  etc.  
Vellaichamy & Jeyshankar16  investigated that a  total of 158 papers were published in the Journal of  Webology from 2004-2013. The degree of collaboration  ranges  from  0.182  to  0.693  and  its  mean  value  is  found  to  be  0.44.  Web  analysis  (24.68  %)  and  social  media  (15.82  %)  papers  are  the  top  most  publications  in  subject-wise  analysis.  India  has  contributed  more  number  of  articles  compared  to  any  other  countries,  such  as  Iran,  UK,  USA  and  Australia. 
Kumar  &  Naqvi4   caluculated  collaboration  measures  like    collaborative  index  (2.38),  degree  of collaboration (0.73), collaborative coefficient, and  modified collaborative coefficient in the fields of natural  sciences  during  1971-2007.  It  was  found  that  231  (18.38  %)    papers  were  written    by  single  author  and  rest  1026  (81.62  %)  papers  were  contributed  by  two  or  more  authors.

6.1.6    Collaboration  Measures  
7 7 13 13 12 52 (1.51 %) 
fj  is  number  of  papers  having  j  authors  during  a  certain  period  of  time;  N  is  the  total  number  of  papers  published  during  a  certain  period  of  time,  and k is the greatest number of authors per paper in  a  discipline. 
(a)  Collaborative  Index  (CI)    
This  is  a  measure  of  mean  number  of  authors  per paper. It is not easily interpretable as a degree.  It  has  no  upper  limit  and  cannot  be  expressed  as  a  percentage.  It  gives  a  non-zero  weight  to  single  authored papers, which involve no collaboration. To  determine collaborative index, the formula given by  Lawani17   was  used.  The  formula  is:  
∑jf( 
k 
j 
) 
CI = 
j1= 
N 
(b)  Degree  of  Collaboration  (DC)      
             
The DC gives the proportion of multiple authored  papers, as measures of strength of collaboration in  a discipline. The DC can be interpreted as a degree,  i.e., lies between 0 and 1. It gives a zero weight to  single-authored  papers,  and  does  not  differentiate  among levels of multiple authorships.The DC equals  1 for maximal collaboration. To determine degree of  author collaboration in quantitative terms, the formula  given by K. Subramanyam18   was used. The formula is: 
C = 
                   
Nm Nm Ns+ 
where  C  is  the  degree  of  collaboration,  Nm  is  
    Different  measures  for  collaboration  are  in  
vogue like collaborative index, degree of collaboration, number  of  multi  authored  papers,  and  Ns  is  the  collaborative  coefficient  and  modified  collaborative  
number  of  single  authored  papers.  In  the  present  coefficient. The  following  notations  are  used  in  the  
study  the  average  value  of  C  is  0.94. As  a  result,  equations to calculate collaborative index, degree of  
the  degree  of  author  collaboration  in  the  journal  collaboration, collaboration coefficient and modified  
under  study  clearly  indicates  its  dominance  on  
collaborative  coefficient.

(c)  Collaborative  Coefficient  (CC)  
The CC was defined by Ajiferuke, et al .,19. It was  designed  to  remove  the  short  comings  pertaining  to  CI  and  DC.  The  CC  always  lies  between  0  and  1.  As  the  number  of  single  authors  dominate,  CC  0.  CC  distinguishes  between  single-authored,  two  authored, three-authored, etc. The problem with CC  is  that  it  does  not  give  the  value  1  for  maximal  collaboration except in the case where the number  of  authors  is  infinite.  
The collaborative coefficient is defined as (CC),  recreate  as:

Table 5 shows the various collaboration measures  in the articles published in the journal. In this study,  it  is  observed  that  collaborative  index,  degree  of  collaboration, collaborative coefficient and modified  collaborative  coefficient  increased  from  2010  to  2014  except  in  2011(CC  &  MCC). 
6.2  citation Analysis 
6.2.1    Number  of  References  vs  Number  of  
Articles  
Table 6 shows that there is a gradual increase  in  the  number  of  references  listed  in  articles  from  2010 to 2014; maximum number of 19863 (24.22 %)  references is in 2014. This may be because of the  growth  of  interdisciplinary  research  and  also  the  gradual  increase  in  number  of  researchers  (and  so  authors)  as  reflected  in  the  increased  number  of  papers  published  in  that  period.  Accordingly,  
Thus 10 papers published in 2010, two published in  2011 and one published in 2012 received more than  100  citations  as  shown  in  Table  7.  It  is  also  found  that another 50 articles are cited in the range of 63- 98  times.  For  the  present  study,  articles  with  more  than 100 citations are considered. The paper titled  Analysis  and  Design  of  Ultra  Thin  Electromagnetic  Absorbers  Comprising  Resistively  Loaded  High  Impedance Surfaces received highest number of 194  citations, followed by Handling Sideband Radiations  in  Time-Modulated Arrays  Through  Particle  Swarm  Optimisation  with  187  citations  which  may  be  on  their  way  to  become  citation  classics21.  
6.  SUMMArY AND cONcLUSIONS 
IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation is a peer-reviewed scientific journal. It published 3442  papers during 2010-2014 with maximum number of  789 articles in 2014 and an average of 688 papers  per  year.  It  has  been  found  that  largest  number  of  articles  was  published  in  the  months  of  April,  February,  and  June,  mainly  due  to  the  publication  of  special  issues  in  these  months.  These  3442  articles  were  contributed  by  86  countries  with  a  maximum number of 57 countries in the year 2013.  Expectedly, most of the contributions (921) are from  USA  followed  by  China  (572);  India  stands  in  the  21st  position with 52 articles. The journal published   2374 articles in core areas, viz. communication (926),  antennas  (733),  wireless  (342),  electromagnetics  (217), wave propagation and scattering (156).

Expectedly  majority  of  991  (28.79  %)  articles  were  contributed  by  3  authors,  clearly  establishing  the  collaborative  research  in  the  frontier  research  fields of cutting edge technologies. This is supported  by  the  maximum  number  of  references  (19863)  listed  by  papers  published  in  2014  with  an  overall  23.65  references  per  paper  with  a  peak  of  25.11  references  per  paper  in  the  year  2014.  This  fact  also  explains  the  vigorous  research  efforts  made  by  a  number  of  researchers  worldwide  in  the  core  areas of the journal. The analysis clearly establishes  the importance of one research paper published in  the  year  2010  which  received  194  citations.  The  paper  also  establishes  that  apart  from  journals,  conferences,  symposia  and  letters  also  are  used  
448 
103 
as  primary  mediums  to  publish  research. 
The present study has observed that the number  of publications in the journal from Indian authors is  very less when compared to European and Western  countries. Although, India has third largest scientific  community, its overall contribution is a mere 1.51 %  with  2.6  %  in  the  field  of  communication  and  2.32 % in antennas. It indicates lack of infrastructure  or  lack  of  expertise  to  guide  research  in  the  area  of  antennas  and  wave  propagation  areas  in  the  country and that more serious efforts are required to  be  done  to  increase  scientific  output  in  this  crucial  subject  in  the  country.  The  major  contribution  of  the  Indian  authors  in  this  journal  is  in  the  area  of  communications.
