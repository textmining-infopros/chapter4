IntRodUctIon 
The terms bibliometrics and scientometrics have  been introduced simultaneously by Pritchard, Nalimov  &  Mulchenko  in  1969.  Pritchard1   defined  the  term  'Bibliometrics' as 'the application of mathematical and  statistical methods to books and other communication  medium'. Nalimov & Mulchenko2  defined 'Scientometrics'  as  'the  application  of  those  quantitative  methods  which are dealing with the analysis of science viewed  as  an  information  process'.  So,  scientometrics  is  the  measurement  of  science  communication,  and  bibliometrics  deals  with  more  general  information  processes. Bandyopadhyay3  has studied the authorship  collaboration  in  physics,  philosophy  and  political  science. The author analysed the authorship pattern  of different disciplines such as mathematics, physics,  mechanical  engineering,  philosophy  and  political  science4. Price5  on the basis of survey of  Chemical  Abstracts, observed a steady trend towards multiple  authorship and thereby holding that if it continues at  the  present  rate,  by  1980  the  single  author  papers  will  be  extinct.  Though  the  above  postulation  may  not  hold  true,  a  decline  in  the  number  of  scientific  papers  published  by  single  authors  is  evident.  Fox  & Fever6   were  of  the  view  that  the  increase  in  the  number  of  multi-authored  papers  may  be  due  to  the collaboration of specialists leading to enhanced  quality  of  research.  The  reasons  for  collaborative  can  be  attributed  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  investigations,  escalating  cost  of  instrumentation  and laboratory facilities and interest of scientists in

the  same  subjects  fields.  Degree  of  collaboration  in  respect  of  a  discipline  in  an  organisation  is  the  ratio  of  multi-authored  papers  published  during  a  year  and  total  number  of  papers  published  during  the  year.  Science  is  an  inherently  collaborative  enterprise. Collaboration being a significant indicator  of  the  nature  of  scientific  activity  is  geographically  dispersed organisation that brings together scientists,  instrumentation  and  data  to  facilitate  scientific  research.  It  supports  rich  and  recurring  human  interaction oriented to a common research area and  provides  access  to  the  data  sources  artifacts  and  tools required to accomplish research5.Collaborators  have  been  made  possible  by  new  communication  and  computational  tools  that  enable  more  flexible  and  ambitious  collaborations.  Such  collaborations  are increasingly necessary. As science progresses,  the  unsolved  problems  become  more  complex,  the  need  for  expensive  instrumentation  increases  larger  data  sets  are  required  and  a  wider  range  of  expertise  is  needed. 
    In  scientific  collaborations,  researchers  work  together  on  a  specific  research  project  with  a  common goal. It can take many forms depending on  the willingness of practitioners to collaborate which  is  influenced  by  the  goals  of  those  providing  the  funding  (e.g.,  Government  agency  or  philanthropic  foundation)  the  needs  of  researchers  for  access  to  knowledge  and  research  tools  the  availability  of  these  researchers  for  access  to  knowledge  and  research  tools,  the  availability  of  these  resources

and the opportunities of practitioners to link together  (e.g.,  Conferences,  internet  connection)7.  Within  a  sub-field of science, practitioners interact or co-operate  with  other  scientists  in  a  variety  of  ways  including  face  to  face  meetings  sharing  papers  and  data  attending seminars and workshops sharing equipment  the  most  intense  being  collaboration  in  research  experimentation. 
International collaboration is an important ingredient  of present day scientific research. Such collaboration  with fruitful exchange of ideas, research techniques,  methods  and  knowledge  can  be  beneficial  to  both  partners. Collaboration between single researchers  can help them to obtain results faster and go ahead  of  the  field  in  such  ‘Big  Science’  environment.  At  the  same  time  co-authorship  is  easily  detected  in  bibliographical  databases  and  widely  used  as  a  reliable  indicator  of  collaboration.  It  is  also  a  method of measuring the integration into international  scientific  community  or  mainstream  connectivity.

Alagappa  University  accredited  with  'A'  Grade  by  National Assessment  and Accreditation  Council  (NAAC)  is  located  at  Karaikudi  in  TamilNadu.  The  440  acre  green  and  lush  campus  houses  all  the  academic  activities.  This  University  has  emerged  from  the  galaxy  of  institutions  initially  founded  by  the  great  philanthropist  and  educationist  Dr.  R.M.  Alagappa  Chettiar. 
Alagappa University was brought into existence  by a Special Act of the Government of TamilNadu in  May  1985  with  the  objective  of  fostering  research,  development  and  dissemination  of  knowledge  in  various  branches  of  learning.  Alagappa  University  is recognised by the University Grants Commission  (UGC) of India. The University has 18 departments,  5 centres and 2 constituent colleges on its campus.  twenty eight affiliated colleges located in the districts  of  Sivaganga  and  Ramanathapuram  are  part  of  the  University.  As  a  member  of  the  Association  of  Indian  Universities  (AIU),  as  well  as  the  member  of  the Association  of  Common  Wealth  Universities  (ACU), it has rewarding relations with other academic  institutions,  research  laboratories  and  industrial  establishments  that  promise  a  spectacular  feature.  The University have international collaborations with  universities/institutions of higher learning in countries  like China, Malaysia, West Indies, USA, and South  Korea.  New  innovative  programmes  suitable  are  designed  and  offered  at  the  University  (for  the  foreign  students).  Many  exchange  programmes  attract  the  attention  of  the  teachers  and  students  from  abroad. 
3.   oB ject IveS 
The objectives of the present study to observe  the trend of research collaboration among teaching  community of Alagappa University, the publications  have  been  brought  out  from  science  and  its  allied  area.  The  main  objectives  of  the  study  are: 
(i) 
To  examine  the  year-wise  distribution  of  the  publications  in Alagappa  University, 
(ii) To  analyse  the  relative  growth  rate  (RGR)  and  
doubling time (DT) of the research productivity,  
and 
(iii) To find out the single author vs. multi authored  
papers with degree of collaboration of research  
productivity.

Methodology 
The study aims to evaluate the research publication  of  Alagappa  university  in  the  field  of  science  and  technology. The degrees of collaboration of authors  are  examined  to  identify  the  pattern  of  research  contribution  in  the  field  of  science.  The  study  is  based  on  the  data  retrieved  from Web  of  Science  (WOS)  database,  an  online  database  provided  by  Thompson Scientific Inc., Philadelphia, USA. Alagappa  University publications identified on WOS  by searching  for the string Alagappa University (‘Alagappa Univ’)  in  the  author  affiliation  field.  Alagappa  University  publications  from  1999-2011  are  considered.  WOS  renders  unique  affiliation  of  all  the  authors;  this  feature of WOS  makes it ideal for collaborative study.  The  research  papers  published  by  the  researchers  of  Alagappa  University  in  the  field  of  science  and  technology covered by the WOS   database  over  12  years (1999-2011) were taken as the prime source  for  the  present  study,  as WOS   is  multidisciplinary  and  provides  affiliations  of  all  the  authors  of  a  publication. The publications, which affiliate at least  one  address  from  Alagappa  University,  are  taken  for  the  analysis.  The  total  publications  produced  during the study period accounted for 776. Bibexcel  is  the  main  tool  used  for  the  analysis  of  the  data  set.  The  idea  is  to  generate  data  files  that  can  be  imported  to  excel  that  takes  tabbed  data  records  for  further  analyse. 
5. AnAlySIS 
The  analysis  includes: (i) Year-wise  distribution,  (ii)  Author-wise  collaboration, (iii) Institutional  collaboration,  and (iv) Subject-wise  collaboration.

5.1   g rowth  of  Research  Productivity  
There  exists  a  direct  equivalence  between  the  
The research output of the Alagappa University is relative  growth  rate  and  the  doubling  time.  If  the  given in Table 1. From the Table, it is observed that number  of  articles/pages  of  subject  double  during  there  is  an  increase  in  the  number  of  publications a  given  period  then  the  difference  the  logarithms  were  published  in  1999  (3.99  %)  and  in  2011 of numbers at the beginning and end of this period  (12.5  %).  However  in  2004  and  2005  it  is  equally must be logarithms of number 2. If natural logarithm  contributed  (7.47  %).  It  is  observed  that  there  is is  used  this  difference  has  a  value  of  0.693.  Thus  less  than  5  %  of  publications  brought  from  1999 the  corresponding  doubling  time  for  each  specific  to  2001,  and  less  than  10  %  of  publications  were period  of  interval  and  for  both  articles  and  pages  published between 2002 and 2008. It is also observed  can  be  calculated  by  the  formula,                                                                                               that more that 10 % of publications occured during

It  has  been  observed  from  Table  2  and  Fig.1  that  RGR  is  down  ward  and  upward    trend  from  2000  (0.04)  to  2011(0.01).  The  doubling  time  (DT)  initially  increases  and  suddenly  decreases  in  the  period  of  study.  The  data  in  Table  2  reveals  that  DT  has  increased  and  the  decreases    from  0.010  to  0.533  during  2000  to  2011.
