ABSTRACT
Agriculture is a vital component to the Indian economy and is necessary to all our daily needs. The
professional associations are committed to accelerate the growth and development of agricultural education,
research and extension in the country. The present study explores the quantitative and qualitative growth of
the agricultural associations in India and their nomenclature. Study also highlights the various activities undertaken
by the agricultural associations in promotion of agricultural publications, organisation of conferences/seminars,
fellowships/scholarships/awards. A list of agricultural associations in the country is also provided.
Keywords: Indian agricultural associations; agricultural associations; agricultural journalism; agricultural learned
societies; agricultural academies

1. INTRODUCTION
Agriculture has played a key role in the development
of human civilisation. Until the industrial revolution, the
vast majority of the human population labored in
agriculture. Agriculture refers to the production of food and
goods through farming and forestry. Agriculture was the
key development that led to the rise of civilisation, with the
husbandry of domesticated animals and plants creating
food surplus that enabled the development of more
densely populated and stratified societies.The agriculture
sector is important for food security, employment
generation, and economic growth. However, concern has
now been expressed on the decline in agricultural growth.
Modern agriculture is knowledge-based, in which
education at all levels; particularly higher education has
an important role. It is time and again said that India is
primarily an agrarian society. Even today almost 70 per
cent of the population depends on agriculture, but in the
last century, the country’s economic and social life
revolved around agriculture and peasants1.
According to Dictionary of Library and Information
Science, an association is defined as “group of persons
who have joined a formal organisation devoted to pursuing
common interest or purpose, usually by paying annual
membership fee”2. In the present day environment, there
is greater co-operation among farmers owing to which a
number of agricultural associations are being born across
the globe. The agro-associations and trade groups are

usually public relations organisations founded and funded
by corporations that operate in the agro industry. The
primary goal is generally to promote the various segments
of the industry through PR activities such as advertising,
education, political donations, lobbying, and publishing.
Those involved in agriculture realise the need for
people to step forth and provide a strong and educated
voice to lead agriculture and bring the needs and issues of
the agricultural industry to the forefront at the community,
state, national, and international level. These professional
associations provide a platform to the agricultural and
rural communities to publish and disseminate their
research findings.

2. NEED AND PURPOSE OF STUDY
The growth and development of any discipline is the
indicator of the of the well established networks of the
professional associations and their role in the concerned
field such as academic and research, research
scholarships/fellowships
and
awards,
products
promotion, and publishing, etc. The role being played by
the Royal Society of London, Zoological Society of
London, Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE), UK and
Institution of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE),
USA are well known in their respective sectors. Similarly,
the role of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences
(NAAS) is well known in the Indian Agricultural Sector.
Through the literature review, it was found that there is no
45

such study undertaken on this topic so far, which provides
the overview of all the agricultural associations in India.
Therefore, realising the need and significance of such
studies for the agricultural researchers/professionals in
the country the present study has been undertaken.

To find out the quantative growth of research
publications being published by agricultural
associations; and

•

To compile a list of agricultural associations in India

3. METHODOLOGY

2.1 Objectives of Study

The study is based on the extensive survey of
published literature under the study such as directories of
associations, government records (Annual Reports),
Websites of the associations and through internet.

The present study has the following objectives:
•

To find out different associations related to
agricultural sciences and technology in India

•

To study the state-wise distribution of the agricultural
associations

•

•

4. DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATIONS
The collected data has been presented in the tables
along with their interpretations.

To identify whether the associations organises the
conferences and seminars for the betterment of the
users and provide fellowship/scholarship to the
researchers

The data has been collected of about 52 associations.
Table 1 shows the names and addresses of these
associations.

5. CONCLUSIONS
The professional associations acknowledge the role in
agriculture information producing, publishing and
dissemination. This information plays a very important
role in the production of food and other raw materials in
the country. These associations also apprehend the
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

problems and accordingly formulate actions to achieve
educational improvement, economic opportunity, and
social advancement and, thereby, promote the national
well-being. One of the primary goals of these professional
associations is to strengthen the agricultural sector by
promoting information exchange and improving
communications among the agricultural communities.
