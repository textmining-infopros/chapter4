AbstrACt 
The present paper is an attempt to assess the research output of genetics research based on the  distribution  of  publications  in  different  sub-specialities  of  genetics. The  study  compares  the  research  priorities  of  16  sub-specialities  of  genetics  in  10 Asian  countries  for  two  time-spans;  1992-2001  and  2002-2011,  using  PubMed  database.  Since  the  raw  publication  counts  are  confounded  by  the  size  of  the countries and the size of the subject specialities, cross-national comparison is made using a relative  
indicator-Research Priority Index.

1. INtrODUCtION 
Genetics, the study of heredity in general and of  genes in particular, though a youngest subject has  grown at an explosive rate because of the scientific  work  carried  out  throughout  the  world. Also,  given  that genes are universal to living organisms, genetics  can  be  applied  to  the  study  of  all  living  systems,  from  virus  to  bacteria,  through  plants  and  animals,  to humans. So, in the last few decades, the science  of  genetics  has  pervaded  all  aspects  of  biology  assuming a central position of great significance in  biology  as  a  whole.  Genetics,  in  fact,  provides  the  modern paradigm for whole of biology. Consequently  today every biologist should be a bit of a geneticist. 
Scientometric  research  plays  a  vital  role  in  the  growth  and  development  of  subject(s)  both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively.  This  change  in  the  trend  can  be  traced  by  generating  numerical  data  on  the  basis  of  the  empirical  evidence  available  in  the  process  of  identifying  the  trends  in  research  priorities  in  a  field.  In  the  recent  past,  studies  dealing  with  the  assessment  of  scientific  research  in genetics by different nations have been reported  in  literature.  So  far  no  work  has  been  undertaken  on  the  studies  dealing  with  the  16  sub-specialities  of  genetics.  The  present  study  seeks  to  assess

The  data  has  been  collected  from  PubMed  database6. The study compares the research priorities  of  16  sub-specialities  of  genetics  in  10  countries  for  two  time-spans;  1992-2001  and  2002-2011.  Comparative  analysis  is  carried  out  based  on  the  distribution of publications in different sub-specialities  of  genetics.  Since  the  raw  publication  counts  are  confounded  by  the  size  of  the  countries  and  the  size of the subject specialities, national comparison  is made using a relative indicator-Research Priority  Index.  To  download  records  from  pubmed,  sub- specialities along with field tag were used in advanced  search. The field tag used was AD for country with  year of publication. In this way,  records  pertaining  to  all  Asian  countries  for  a  particular  year  was  downloaded,  out  of  which  10  major  countries  were  selected  for  the  study.  The  results  were  analysed  on  the  basis  of  their  sub-fields.

Publication output of world in 16 sub-specialities  of  genetics  is  indicated  in Table  1.  From  the Table  1, it is evident that, Molecular Genetics and human  Genetics  accounts  for  68  %  of  the  total  output  in  1992-2001  and  60  %  in  2002-2011.  Molecular  Genetics alone accounts for the largest output 38 %  in 1992-2001 and human Genetics 30 % in 2002-2011  
block periods. Ecological Genetics accounts for the  smallest output of 0.1 % in 1992-2001 and Genetics  of Intelligence 0.2 % in 2002-2011. The table clearly  indicates  the  importance  of  trends  in  all  the  16  branches  which  has  increased  or  decreased  over  a  period  of  twenty  years.

Research  focus  seems  to  be  on  Molecular  Genetics  in  world  during  both  the  block  periods.  The  reason  for  such  output  in  molecular  genetics  is  the  availability  of  sophisticated  equipments  and  technologies which has enabled the researchers to  analyse the science of inheritance at the molecular  level.  Also  the  primary  aim  of  the  hGP  being  to  identify  the  different  human  diseases  governed  by  gene  mutations  and  to  develop  the  molecular  kits  for  easy  diagnosis  and  drugs  to  overcome  the  problems.  Another  reason  for  highest  growth  in  Molecular  Biology  might  be  due  to  molecular  approach  for  the  final  conclusion  of  all  different  fields  of  biological  sciences.

1992-2001 and Japan and China 65 % in 2002-2011.  The decline during 2002-2011 may be due to decline  in  share  of  Japan  from  66  %  to  38  %.  Whereas,  China’s share has increased from 5 % in 1992-2001  to  27  %  in  2002-2011.  Other  40  Asian  countries  contributing 4.1 % in 1992-2001 has also increased  to 7.39 % in 2002-2011. Among 10 countries selected  for  the  present  study,  Japan  leads  with  155628  articles followed by China 73229; India 19108; Israel  18592; Taiwan  18152;  Georgia  9701; Turkey  6467;  Russia 6398; South Korea 6194, and hong Kong 6121.

The distribution of publications of major countries  in  different  sub-specialities  of  genetics  for  1992- 2001 and 2002-2011 is presented in Table 3 and 4  respectively. The  publications  in  different  countries  are  arranged  in  the  form  of  a  matrix  where  the  rows  represent  the  countries  and  columns  the  sub-specialities.  
Table  3  covers  articles  published  in  different  branches of genetics during the block period 1992- 2001. Columns represent 16 branches and the rows  10  different Asian  countries.  The  data  reveals  that  major contribution is from Japan (85801) followed by  Israel (11833); China (8669); Taiwan (6197); Georgia  (5875),  India  (4951);  Russia  (2345);  hong  Kong  (1581);  Turkey  (1208);  and  South  Korea  (1201). 
Maximum  number  of  articles  published  during  this block period among the branches of genetics is  from Molecular Genetics (46867) followed by human  Genetics  (41683).  Which  indicates  the  importance  of  the  branch  Molecular  genetics,  as  molecular  approach  is  needed  for  the  final  conclusion  in  all  the fields of biological sciences. And same trend has  been  observed  with  world  as  seen  in  Table  1. 
The  data  in  Table  4  reveals  articles  published  in  16  branches,  represented  in  different  columns  and  10  countries  in  rows  during  2002-2011.  In  the  present  block  period  also,  it  is  Japan  which  has  maximum  number  of  articles  published  (130060)  however,  it  is  followed  by  China  (115689);  India  (26456);  Israel  (22033);  Taiwan  (21970);  Georgia

Branch-wise  contribution  indicates  maximum  growth in the field of human Genetics with the major  contribution  of  106181  articles  during  this  block  period,  followed  by  Molecular  Genetics  (102537).  During  both  block  periods  Genetics  of  Intelligence  has  lesser  number  of  articles  output. 
The increase in the number of articles in human  Genetics may be due to the complexity of the human  genome.  The  human  Genome  Project  (hGP)  is  producing a wealth of new information on genetics.  The project began in October 1990 and was initially  headed  by  Ari  Patrinos,  head  of  the  Office  of  Biological  and  Environmental  Research  in  the  US  Department  of  Energy's  Office  of  Science.  Francis  Collins directed the National Institutes of health and  National human Genome Research Institute efforts.  A  working  draft  of  the  genome  was  announced  in  2000  and  a  complete  one  in  2003,  with  further,  more  detailed  analysis  still  being  published.

The  raw  count  alone  does  not  convey  much  information as these figures are confounded by the  size  of  the  countries  and  the  size  of  the  subject  specialities. hence, an index called Relative Priority  Index (PI) is computed for cross national comparison  using  formula  as  suggested  by  Nagpaul7.

The  value  PI=100  indicates  that  the  research  priority  of  a  country  for  a  given  sub-speciality  corresponds precisely to the average of all countries,  i.e.,  average  priority;  PI>100  reflects  higher-than- average  priority,  and  PI<100  lower-than-average  priority.  It  has  to  be  kept  in  view  that  (by  virtue  of  the  definition  of  PI)  no  country  can  have  high  priority  in  all  sub-specialities. 
The profile of research priorities of major countries  are presented in Table 5 and 6 for two time-spans-  1992-2001  and  2002-2011.

The relationship between different countries and  sub-specialities of genetics on the basis of citability  profiles  is  carried  out  by  using  PCA.  
The  Principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  is  carried out by using the SPSS software. The PCA  is  a  statistical  procedure  that  uses  orthogonal  transformation  to  convert  a  set  of  observations  of  possibly  correlated  variables  into  a  set  of  values  of  linearly  uncorrelated  variables  called  principal  components. The number of principal components is less  than  or  equal  to  the  number  of  original  variables.    
In  this  analysis,  first  covariance  matrix  for  all  16 sub specialties of Genetics was calculated. Then  Eigen values of the co-variance matrix were calculated  and  hence  the  corresponding  Eigen  vectors.  Each  Eigen value represents the total variance explained  by  the  corresponding  sub  specialties  of  Genetics. 
The data for the study consists of 16 sub-specialities  of  genetics  and  10  Asian  countries  for  two  time  spans 1992-2001 and 2002-2011. The PCA seeks the  linear combination of the original variable, which has  maximal variance. The examination of this might seek  sensible a large variance ‘separates out’ the countries.  The  countries  can  then  be  ranked  with  respect  to  this  Standard  Linear  Combination  (SLC). 
More  generally,  PCA  looks  for  a  few  linear  combinations  which  can  be  used  to  summarise

the  data  losing  in  process  as  little  information  as  possible.  The  attempt  reduces  the  dimensionality  of  the  field. 
In the cited profiles of different sub-specialities  of genetics for two spans 1992-01 and 2002-11, all  the16  sub-specialities  are  extracted.  Except  three  sub-specialities  remaining  shows  26  %  for  both  block periods (Table 7). Therefore it is necessary to  consider only three sub-specialities, which explains  more than 74 % of the total variance during 1992- 2001  and  2002-2011. 
The  PCA  analysis  (Table  7)  carried  out  by  using  SPSS  package  indicates  three  groups  of  sub-specialities  based  on  correlation  (Table  8).  During  1992-01,  data  reveals  that  out  of  16  sub- specialities  of  genetics,  Behavioural  Genetics,  Ecological  Genetics,  Molecular  Genetics,  Microbial  Genetics,  Evolutionary  Genetics,  human  Genetics  and  Conservation  Genetics  are  correlated  forming  a  group  indicating  the  interrelationship  among  the  subspecialties  of  Genetics.  however,  the  second  cluster includes Genetics of Intelligence, Quantitative  Genetics, Medical Genetics, Developmental Genetics,  Psychiatric Genetics and Genomics which exhibits their  uniqueness and divergence from the first group. The  third cluster includes Population Genetics, Classical  Genetics and Genetic Engineering. During the second  block period 2002-11, Molecular Genetics, Genomics,  human Genetics, Psychiatric genetics, Conservation  Genetics, Medical Genetics and Ecological Genetics  constitute  first  group.  however,  the  second  group  includes Behavioural Genetics, Evolutionary Genetics,

9. CONClUsIONs 
Genetics,  the  most  rapidly  growing  area  of  research has relevance to many aspects of human  life  and  society,  including  health,  behaviour,  food  production,  forensics  and  even  politics.  If  used  wisely,  the  new  information  promises  to  enhance  our  quality  of  life.  Science  indicators  are  used  for  both  descriptive  as  well  as  analytical  purposes  to  identify  trends,  make  comparisons  and  as  an  aid  for  theoretical  understanding  of  casual  structure  related  to  science  and  technology  systems. 
On  the  basis  of  the  analysis  the  following  conclusions  may  be  drawn: 
(1) Among  the  10  major  Asian  countries,  Japan  
accounts  for  the  largest  output  of  genetics  
literature. It alone accounts for 66 % of the Asian  
output  in  1992-2001  and  38  %  in  2002-2011. (2) Among  50  Asian  countries,  India  occupies  
3rd   position  in  contributing  to  the  genetics  
research. 
(3) Among  sub-specialities,  Molecular  genetics  
accounts  for  the  largest  output  of  38  %  in  
1992-2001and  30  %  in  2002-2011. 
(4) The  sub-speciality,  Genetics  of  Intelligence  
accounts  for  the  lowest  output  of  0.2  %  during  
both  block  periods. 
(5) PCA analysis indicates three groups of sub-specialities  
based  on  correlation  among  them. 
It  can  be  observed  from  the  present  study  that  R&D  trends  are  more  active  and  are  gaining  importance.  Though,  to  some  extent  each  field  (among  the  16  sub  fields)  overlaps  with  the  other  fields  of  genetics.  The  variation  in  the  number  of  articles  in  Molecular  Genetics  indicates  that  the  research  in  this  area  has  gained  more  importance  compared  to  other  sub-specialities  of  genetics.
