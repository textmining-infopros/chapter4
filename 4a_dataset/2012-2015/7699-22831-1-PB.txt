 Abstr Act 
This study attempts to undertake bibliometric analysis of the research publications of Gujarat University  during the ten-year period between 2004 and 2013. The data for this study was extracted from SCOPUS  and included a total of 760 publications that were attributed to authors affliated to Gujarat University. The  publication data was analysed with respect to the type of publications where 83% are journal articles.  The paper also analysed the publication trend of Gujarat University and found that from 2008 onwards  there  was  a  steady  increase  in  the  number  of  publications. The  other  aspects  that  were  identifed  in  the  paper  were  the  most  prolifc  authors,  collaborative  authorship  patterns  and  trends,  most  preferred  publications, and so on. The collaboration was found to be the highest in the year 2012 at 0.70 based  on the modifed collaboration coeffcient. The most preferred journal for publication by Gujarat University  faculty was ActaPoloniaePharmaceutica-Drug Research  and the most cited author of Gujarat University  was P.S. Srivastav, while V.K. Jain had the best average citations per paper.

1. IntrodUctIon 
Evaluation  and  ranking  of  higher  education  systems  is  gaining  importance  in  India,  and  this  has contributed immensely in improving the quality  of  discussions  and  deliberations  among  the  higher  education  community  in  India.  An  outcome  of  the  poor  performance  of  Indian  universities  in  the  leading  global  universities  rankings  has  led  to  the  unanimous  public  agreement  across  the  nation  that  there  is  a  need  to  improve  the  ratings  of  our  universities.  
It  is  quite  evident  from  the  leading  rankings  of  universities that both, research output and impact, play  an important role in overall performance evaluation  of  a  university  or  higher  education  institution.  The  role  of  research  and  citations  in  the  ranking  of  universities has been identified to very important and  in  fact  in  of  one  such  popular  ranking,  the  Times  Higher  Education  2013,  the  weightage  assigned  to  the  research  (volume,  income  and  reputation)  and  citations  (research  influence)  is  60  %1.  Research  is considered as one of the main indicators to rate  universities  in  the  QS  World  University  rankings  2012-132   and  it  may  be  worthwhile  to  note  that  Universities 21 Ranking of  National Higher Education  Systems,  20143   also  emphasises  largely  on  the  quality and quantity of research output of respective  countries. 
In this backdrop, it is quite evident that research  plays  an  important  role  in  the  recognition  and  
credibility  of  any  university  in  today’s  context.  As  the  importance  and  impact  of  university  rankings  increase,  it  is  obvious  that  identifying,  reviewing,  monitoring,  and  measuring  the  research  output  of  universities becomes pertinent. Bibliometrics is one  of the widely used tools to identify, collate, measure,  and analyse, and review the research productivity of  individuals, groups, organisations or institutions, and  countries.  Bibliometrics  also  facilitates  comparison  of  the  research  productivity  among  individuals,  groups,  institutions  or  countries.  
Gujarat University, one of the oldest universities  in  India,  established  in  1949,  offers  post  graduate,  MPhil  and  doctoral  level  degree  programmes  in  various subjects under different disciplines or streams  of  study  that  include  science,  commerce,  arts  and   social science, computer science, medicine, etc. The  university had more than 1200  research  papers  to  its credit since its establishment. The present study  is  an  attempt  to  explore  and  analyse  the  research  output of Gujarat University published during 2004- 2013  (10  years)

the indicator of quantity and quality of publications  to  develop  a  performance  indicator  to  rank  the  institutions. 
Vasishta6   undertook  a  study,  based  on  data  extracted  from  scopus,  of  the  177  papers  of  PEC  (Punjab Engineering College) University of Technology,  Chandigarh  published  between  1996  and  2009  to  examine the research productivity, publication trend,  collaboration trend, etc. The study reported that though  there  was  steady  growth  in  research  publications,  there was a need to improve the publication output  substantially  when  comparison  was  made  to  the  publication  output  of  other  engineering  colleges. 
Koganuramath7 et  al.,  analysed  663  papers  published  during  1990-2000  and  authored  by  the  scientists of TISS (Tata Institute of Social Sciences)  to identify author productivity, areas of specialisation  and  publication  pattern.  The  study  also  revealed  the  collaboration  patterns,  most  prolific  authors  and  list  of  preferred  journals  for  publishing  by  the  scientists  of  TISS. 
Exploring  the  research  output  in  terms  of  the  papers  published  by  researchers  of  the  University  of  Mysore,  Kumbar,  Gupta  &  Dhawan8,  extracted  15-18  papers  from  Scopus  in  different  disciplines  of  science  and  technology  and  published  between  1996  and  2006.  The  study  identified  the  strong  and  weak  areas  of  research  in  terms  of  number  of  papers  published  at  the  university,  annual  growth  rate  of  publications,  impact  generated  in  terms  of  average citations received, the collaboration pattern  in  different  subjects  and  collaboration  pattern  with  authors  from  other  countries. The  study  found  that  the  number  research  publications  at  the  university  were  increasing  at  an  average  rate  of  23  %  per  annum  in  terms  of  the  papers  being  published.  
A similar study was done by Thirumagal9  taking  publication data from the Web of Science database  to study the scientific publications of Manonmaniam  Sundaranar  University.  Analysing  363  publications  that  were  published  between  1999  and  2011,  the  study reported that there was an increasing trend in  collaborative  publication,  with  93  %  of  publications  being journals papers. The paper also provided for  the LCS (local citation score) and GLS (global citation  score)  of  each  author  included  in  the  study. 
To assess the research contribution of Karnataka  University  in  science  and  technology,  Kumbar  &  Gupta10  analysed the research papers extracted from  Scopus database and published between the years  2001  and  2010.  By  analysing  these  1467  papers,  authors found that the publication growth was nearly  14 % per annum. Other aspects included collaboration  trend,  growth  trend,  prolific  authors,  were  highly  cited  papers,  subject-wise  publication,  etc.  The  study  suggested  that  there  was  an  urgent  need  to  increase research publications at the university and  
10 
that  it  would  be  desirable  to  incentivise  publishing  activities  of  the  researchers. 
Wani, et al.,11   analysed  the  research  output  of  All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) from  1959-2011, identified 17,181 papers extracted from  Scopus database. The study found that there was a  need for proper planning to balance the publication  and  research  productivity  of  various  branches  of  medical sciences at AIIMS as some of the branches  outpaced  others  by  large  margins. 
Angadi, et al.,12  studied the research productivity  of University of Madras by collecting publication data  for  the  years  1999  to  2011  from  Web  of  Science  database. A total of 3,831 publications were analysed  to find out the collaboration pattern, prolific authors,  most  preferred  journals,  high-frequency  keywords,  etc.  The  authors  found  that  journal  is  the  most  preferred  form  of  the  publication  by  the  authors  of  University  of  Madras,  and  it  amounts  more  than  93 % of the total publications. The authors suggested  that further research on this topic by including other  qualitative indicators based on citations and impact  factor  of  the  publications. 
To  analyse  the  research  productivity,  most  prolific authors, most preferred journals, most cited  journals, etc., of the Indian Institute of Management,  Ahmedabad  (IIMA),  Kumar  &  Dora13   undertook  a  study  with  publication  data  from  the  year  1999  to  2010, extracted from the Scopus and Web of Science  databases. By analysing these research papers, the  authors  found  that  at  IIMA  there  was  a  constant  increase  in  the  number  of  papers  being  published,  collaborative  authorship  and  of  multidisciplinary  research  over  the  years.

MethodoLoGy 
Data of the publications of all major government  universities of Gujarat was extracted through SCOPUS,  which is one of the most popular sources of information  that  provides  abstract  and  index  of  publications  at  a  global  level.  To  assess  the  research  output  of  Gujarat  University,  it’s  publications  over  a  ten-year  period of 2004- 2013 were considered for the study.  The  data  of  the  last  ten  years  was  considered  to  be  reasonable,  based  on  many  previous  studies,  in  size  to  assess  the  research  publication  trend

of  Gujarat  University.  The  data  was  selected  by  searching  for  the  institutional  affiliation  ‘Gujarat  University’  in  the  Scopus  database.  The  resultant  data  was  further  refined  by  country  India,  as  there  was another ‘Gujarat University’ in Pakistan too. The  refined  result  was  exported  as  CSV  file  and  then  used for further analysis. The final data consisted of  760 publications by authors from Gujarat University  during  the  ten  years  between  2004  and  2013. 
5.   dA tA  An ALysIs 
To  set  the  context  for  this  study,  initially  the  publication data of major government universities in  Gujarat  was  considered  and  the  following  Table  1  reveals  that  Gujarat  University,  though  one  of  the  earlier established universities, does not fare sufficiently  well  in  comparison  to  other  universities.

University  during  2004-2013 
The  first  level  of  analysis,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1,  of  the  760  publications  of  the  Gujarat  University,  reveals that 83 % (631) were journal articles, followed  by  conference  papers  which  were  14  %  (103)  and  other  document  types  like  editorial,  review  papers,  and  letters  constituted  merely  3  %  (26). 
University  during  the  ten  year  period  of  2004- 2013. The results show that though there has been  overall growth over the ten year period, there have  
been incidences of decline in number of publications  in 2005 and 2010 when compared to their previous  years.  In  rest  of  the  other  years,  there  has  been  a  marked  growth  in  number  of  publications  over  the  previous  years. 
5.2   y ear-wise  Growth  in  Publications  
Research publications do constitute an important  basis in ranking of institutions, apart from infrastructure,  faculty,  student,  and  other  variables.  Most  of  the  institutions in India are now emphasising on research  and encouraging researchers to publish more. Figure  2  shows  that  there  has  been  a  steady  growth  in  research  publications  at  the  Gujarat  University  during  the  ten  year  period  of  2004-2013.  The  results  show  that  though  there  has  been  overall  growth  over  the  ten  year  period,  there  have  been  incidences  of  decline  in  number  of  publications  in  2005  and  2010  when  compared  to  their  previous  years.  In  rest  of  the  other  years,  there  has  been  a  marked  growth  in  number  of  publications  over  the  previous  years. 
5.3 Most  Prolific Authors 
The  data  on  Gujarat  University  publications  during the 10 years between 2004 and 2013 reveals  that  in  total,  935  authors  contributed  to  publishing  of  the  760  publications.  The  data  was  sorted  by  the  number  of  publications  by  each  author  and  a

However,  it  was  interesting  to  note  that  the  listing  of  these  20  most  productive  authors  when  ranked on the basis of average citations per paper  (ACPP)  would  differ  substantially  V.K.  Jain  leads  the  top  with  first  rank  in ACPP. 
5.4 Authorship  Pattern 
Collaboration among authors plays an important  role in research production and Lancaster14   had  in  his  research  found  that  ‘a  major  factor  in  research  productivity is research collaboration and collaborative  authorship.’  Bibliometric  studies  have  indicated  that  over  time  collaborative  authorship  is  gaining  popularity and more papers are being published  in  collaboration  rather  than  through  individual  efforts.  To  further  explore  this  aspect  of  authorship  in  the  present  study,  the  data  was  divided  into  two  time  blocks of 5 years each, i.e., 2004-2008 and 2009- 2013. The co authorship index (CAI), as developed  by Garg & Padhi15, was calculated for the 4 groups  of  authorship,  i.e.,  single,  two,  multi  (3  and  4)  and  mega  (5  and  above)  collaborations. 
Table  3.  indicates  that  in  both  the  2  blocks  (2004-08 and 2009-13) the trend in authorship was

in favour of moving away from single author papers.  It  is  worthwhile  noting  that  the  CAI  is  above  100  for  multi  and  mega  authors  in  the  block  of  2009- 13,  which  indicates  a  good  trend15. 
5.5   c ollaboration trend 
Collaboration happens in the context of research  publications  is  when  two  or  more  than  two  authors  research on the same problem and publish a paper  with joint authorship. The extent of collaboration in  a  specific  field  or  a  year  can  be  identifiedthrough  measures  like  the  CI  (Collaborations  Index)  that  measures  the  mean  authors  per  paper.  Later  on,  Subramanyam16   developed  the  DC  (Degree  of  Collaboration) measure that was derived by the simple  calculation  of  the  proportion  of  multiple  authors  to  the total papers. DC was further extended to derive  a measure, called as CC (Collaborative Coefficient)  that combined the mean value of authors per paper  and  the  proportion  of  multiple  authors. 
A  recent  measure  that  modified  the  CC,  called  as  MCC  (Modified  Collaboration  Coefficient),  by  Savnur & Srikanth17  represents a better and efficient  indication of the collaboration among authors. Adopting  the  MCC  calculation  of  Savnur  &  Srikant,  Table  4  reveals  that  while  2012  was  the  best  year  for  collaboration,  based  on  MCC;  2010  was  the  best  year  for  Gujarat  University  in  terms  of  DC.    
Table 5 reveals the authorship collaboration trend  in  the  731  papers  (authored  by  two  or  more)  in  terms of international, domestic and local affiliations.  Collaboration  was  classified  as  local  when  all  the  authors  were  from  the  Gujarat  University  itself  and  when  the  authors  were  from  other  Indian  institutions,  the  collaboration  was  categorised  as  domestic  and  for  all  other  papers  where  at  least  one  of  the  authors  was  from  outside  India,  the  papers were categorised as international. The data  shows  that  there  was  quite  a  lot  of  fluctuation  in

the international collaboration over the years, while  collaboration  with  authors  from  other  institutions  (domestic)  was  improving  continuously,  except  in  the  year  2012. 
Further analysis on the collaboration pattern by  the  affiliation  of  the  collaborating  authors  is  shown  in Table 6 that includes institutions with at least 10  authors  who  collaborated  with  Gujarat  University  authors.  Sardar  Patel  University  topped  the  list  of  collaborating  institutions  with  75  of  its  authors  collaborating  with  the  Gujarat  University  authors. 
5.6 Most  Preferred  journals 
The  data  collected  for  the  study  indicated  that  from the 760 publications of the authors from Gujarat  University  over  the  10-year  period,  83  %  of  them  (631) were articles published in 293 journals. Among  these  293  journals,  ‘ActaPoloniaePharmaceutica- Drug  Research’  was  the  most  preferred  journal  with  30  papers,  followed  by Fluoride   (27),  Journal  of Chromatography B(19),  and  so  on.The  resulting  list  of  journals,  ranked  by  the  number  of  papers  published by authors from Gujarat University during  the  ten  years  between  2004  and  2013  is  shown  in  Table  7.  
It  may  be  noted  that  the  journals  in  the  areas  of  science  and  technology  dominate  the  list  and  journals  related  to  the  subject  of  Chemistry  seem

to  be  very  popular  among  the  Gujarat  University  authors,  indicating  it  as  the  most  productive  areas  of  research  at  the  University.  The  other  indication  that could be derived from this list is the popularity  of  inter  disciplinary  journals  among  the  authors.  It  may also be noted that among these journals, that  included  at  least  7  papers,  3  were  Indian  and  4  were  from  Netherlands. 
5.7 List  of  highly  cited  Papers 
Impact of  research is an important yardstick in  evaluation of any research and counting the citations  is  one  of  the  important  and  common  criteria  used  in  calculating  the  impact  of  research.  Citations  are  indications  of  positive  recognition  to  the  published  work  of  author(s)  and  the  journal  itself  and  it  can  be  said  that  the  number  of  citations  received  is  directly  proportional  to  the  recognition  or  impact  of  the  published  work.  Exploring  the  citation  data,  for  all  the  760  publications  during  the  year  2004  and  2013,  524  (67  %)  papers  are  cited  and  236  (33 %) papers have not been cited in any publication.  Table  8  shows  the  most  cited  papers,  i.e.,  top  ten  ranks  by  citation  count.

has  been  an  overall  trend  of  growth  in  research  publications  over  the  ten-year  period  (2004-2013).  The study clearly indicates that journals are the most  preferred  form  of  publication  by  the  researchers  of  Gujarat University. The research collaboration trend  indicated  a  positive  environment  of  collaboration  and  in  most  of  the  recent  years  (2004-2013)  the  number  of  collaborative  papers  seems  to  be  on  the  rise.  In  fact  the  co  authorship  index  (CAI)  of  the  later  years  of  the  study  2009-2013  indicates  a  healthy  trend  towards  multi  and  mega  authorship.  The modified collaboration coefficient also indicates  that in the recent years (2009 to 2013) there was an  improvement  in  terms  of  collaborative  research. 
The study also indicates that though international  collaborations existed in its research output, Gujarat  University  needs  considerable  improvement  in  this  area.  The  university  could  gain  much  through  international  collaboration  by  not  only  increasing  the  research  productivity  of  its  researchers,  but  also  may  facilitate  improvement  in  citations  to  its  publications.  There  is  a  dire  need  to  improve  the  quality of research in humanities and social sciences  research  and  compete  with  the  papers  published  in the science and technology domain especially in  chemistry, in terms of citation count, within Gujarat  University itself. In comparison to other institutions  like  Madras  University  where  average  publication

is  296 papers per year12   and  Mysore  University  it  is  206  papers  in  20068,  Gujarat  University  seems  to  be  far  behind  in  terms  of  the  number  of  papers  published.  While  comparing  its  publications  output  with other universities in Gujarat state also, Gujarat  University  does  not  fare  too  well.  
The  present  study  could  find  its  use  with  the  Gujarat University authorities to explore the reasons,  issues and challenges in improving its research profile.  The  study  leads  to  the  following  suggestions:  (a) Design and develop research-friendly environment  
at  the  university  to  promote  research (b) Invest  in  developing  research  support  facilities  
for  the  researchers 
(c) Promote  the  publishing  efforts  of  authors  with  
special  awards  or  incentives 
(d) Conduct  workshops  to  improve  research  and  
publishing  efforts  of  its  researchers 
(e) Develop strategies to address the imbalances in  
research  output  across  various  departments
