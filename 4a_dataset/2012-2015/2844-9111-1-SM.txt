ABSTRACT
The paper analyses quantitatively the Indian research in Materials Science during 2001-2010 on several
parameters including publication growth and rank, country-wise contribution, material-wise contribution, share
of international collaborative linkages and leading collaborating countries, most productive Indian institutions
and authors, and characteristics of high cited papers.
Keywords: Scientometric, global publication share, India publication output

1. INTRODUCTION
Materials are the basic substances. They can be
natural like wood or human-made like plastic. Material
scientists create and combine materials in new ways;
their numbers is almost very large. There are now about
30,000 different known-materials. Materials Science
covers a huge range of activities and touches upon
different fields including chemistry, biology, applied
physics, chemical, mechanical, civil and electrical
engineering, etc.1 Materials Science is an interdisciplinary
field where scientists conduct a systematic investigation
of each material, in terms of its structure, properties,
processing, and performance. The research often leads to
new applications of known materials and the creation of
new materials with desired properties. The basis of
Materials Science involves relating the desired properties
and relative performance of a material in a certain
application to the structure of the atoms and phases in
that material through characterisation. The major
determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its
properties are its constituent chemical elements and the
way in which it has been processed into its final form.
These characteristics, taken together and related through
the laws of thermodynamics, govern a material’s
microstructure, and thus its properties2. Materials
Science is one of the oldest forms of applied science and
engineering. In the history of human civilisation, different
eras have often been retrospectively identified according

to an advance in the human ability to work with a new type
of material. Examples are the Stone Age, Bronze Age,
and Iron Age. A major breakthrough in the understanding
of materials occurred in the late nineteenth century, when
Willard Gibbs demonstrated that thermodynamics
relating to atomic structure in various phases are related
to the physical properties of a material. Many important
elements of modern Materials Science have resulted from
the space race. In particular, the understanding and
engineering of metallic alloys, ceramics, and other
materials were useful for the construction of space
vehicles, space suits, and so forth, and the new
knowledge was found valuable for various consumer and
industrial applications as well. Materials Science has laid
the physical foundations of 21st century civilisation, and
will continue to be centrally important in the quest for
finding technological solutions toward sustainable
development in the face of environmental degradation and
the continued buildup of greenhouse gases due to the
burning of carbon-based fuels3.
In the past, only a few scientometric studies have
been conducted in this area. Among these studies, one of
the earliest studies was conducted by Kochhar4, et al. on
the analysis of research output from Indian institutions in
seven categories of materials, namely, metals and alloys,
aluminum, ceramics, composites, glass, polymers and
wood during 1980-89 as per the database developed by
INSDOC under a funded project from TIFAC. Mohan5 et al.

analysed 2587 international collaborative papers from
Indian scientists during 1995-99, as covered in Materials
Science Citation Index. It analysed the nature of
collaboration and the countries of collaboration along with
the areas of subject emphasis. Walke6 et al. made a
quantitative assessment of Indian Materials Science
output (9545 papers) during 1993-2001 using Web of
Science database. It analysed growth, size of
publications output and research quality, media of
communication, strong and weak areas of research,
nature of collaboration and institutional productivity.
Kshitij & Sinha7 dealt with Indian materials production and
trade, R&D strategy and knowledge generation (research
output) in universities and research institutes and extent
of international collaboration in publications by different
type of materials. Bakshi8 attempts to provide a broad
picture of priority areas in Materials Science research and
identification of leading institutions in India. Kademani9, et
al. analysed 14849 Indian publications in Materials
Science during 1999-2008 using Scopus database. It
analysed India’s publications growth, citation impact,
international collaborative papers share, leading
institutions and authors, etc. Adams & Pendlebury10
examine the origin and nature of Materials Science field,
review its growth globally and identified the key players
and also looks selectively at some of its current diversity
in terms of hot topics.

2. OBJECTIVES
The main purpose of this study is to analyse the
research performance of India in Materials Science as
reflected in its publications output during 2001-10. The
objectives are to study: (i) Indian research output, its
growth, rank and global publications share; (ii) Patterns of
international collaboration and identify the major
collaborative partners; (iii) Contribution by different types
of materials and their citation impact; (iv) Publications
productivity and citation impact of leading institutions and
authors; and (v) Characteristics of its high cited papers.

3. METHODOLOGY AND SOURCE OF DATA
The study used Scopus database (http://
www.scopus.com) to extract relevant data on Materials
Science research in India and other most productive
countries for the past ten years (2001-10). Scopus is the
international multidisciplinary database indexing 18000
peer-reviewed journals (including 1800 open access
journals), besides more than 500 international seminar/
conference proceedings, 400 trade publications and 300
book series. In this analysis, all types of items included in
the database are covered. A three-year citation window
has been used for counting the citations received and to
access the impact of Indian research output. The main
search strategy string used for generating Indian
publications output in medicine was as follows: “affi
l(India) and pubyear aft 2000 and pubyear bef 2011 and
478

(limit-to (subjarea, “mate”)). For generating research
output on different types of materials, research strategies
were developed which primarily used materials name in
title, abstract and keywords. For calculating the total
international collaborative papers in Materials Science, a
separate search strategy, which combines India’s
collaboration with 140 countries, was prepared and this
strategy was combined with the main string and search
strategy to generate India’s total collaborative papers. For
analysing institutional, authors’ and journals’ output,
separate search strategies were evolved and these
strategies were combined with the main search strategy
to generate the desired output.
