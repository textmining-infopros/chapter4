ABSTRACT 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the workplace learning among the library professionals  in  university  libraries  in  Kerala.    Structured  questionnaires  were  employed  to  collect  data  from  a  representative  sample  of  100  library  professionals  from  the  central  libraries  of  the  University  of  Kerala,  Mahatma  Gandhi  University,  and  University  of  Calicut.  The  analysis  shows  that  majority  of  the  library  professionals  are  engaged  in  workplace  learning.  It  is  found  that  formal  learning  methods  contribute  much  for  workplace  learning  in  the  libraries.  The  library  professionals  engage  in  workplace  learning  to  keep  them  up-to-date.  Most  of  the  professionals  are  self  motivated  and  they  acquire  the  skills  for  digital  library  development  through  these  learning  interventions.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Information and communication technology (ICT)  acts  as  a  catalyst  for  developments  in  all  walks  of  human  life.  The  developments  in  libraries    and  information  centres  are  no  exception  to  this.    The  application  of  ICT  has  dramatically  changed  the  information access, management, and dissemination in  libraries.  Modern libraries are extensively exploiting  new  and  innovative  technologies  for  information  handling. These technologies allow libraries to offer  a wide range of services to library users and equip  them  to  access  information  through  a  wide  variety  of  interfaces.  
To  keep  in  tune  with  the  rapid  changes  in  ICT,  and  flow  with  the  trends  in  the  field  of  library  and  information  science,  library  professionals  need  to  equip  themselves.  The  most  effective  way  to  keep  up  with  these  changes  is  to  seek  out  professional  development  opportunities1.  Learning  is  necessary  to  adapt  with  changes,  for  professional  growth,  and  to  manage  the  workplace.  As  far  as  library  professionals,  the  workplace  can  play  a  significant  role  in  the  process  of  learning.  Learning  occurs  in  the  workplace  by  formal,  informal,  and  incidental  means.  
Workplace learning is a process whereby employees  acquire knowledge, skills, and attitudes that enhance  their individual performance and organisational tasks2.  It  comes  as  a  result  of  autonomous  self-directed  
learning by employees to satisfy their organisational  needs  at  the  workplace3.  For  library  professionals  are  concerned,  workplace  learning  is  a  process  by  which they learn in the workplace, from basic skills  to  high  technology  and  management  skills.  The  explosive  growth  of  new  knowledge;  widespread  use of ICT; increased reliance on e-resources; and  changing  trends  in  library  services  have  promoted  workplace  learning  in  libraries4.  It  is  essential  in  the  personal,  and  professional  development  of  library professionals and a key strategic element in  achieving  their  library  objectives  and  goals.    
This study investigates the methods, obstacles   and  the  facilitators  of  workplace  learning  among  the  library  professionals  in  the  university  libraries  in  Kerala.    
2.  LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Workplace  learning  in  libraries  has  been  a  topic  of  serious  discussion  very  recently  from  the  inception of Working Group on Continuing Professional  Development, and Workplace Learning (CPDWL) for  libraries  by  the  International  Federation  of  Library  Associations,  and  Institutions  (IFLA).  There  have  been  some  studies  focused  on  workplace  learning  in  libraries.  
Li5   conducted  a  study  on  librarians’  informal  learning  in  the  workplace  in  Taiwan  universities.  The  results  showed  that  librarians  primarily  learn

through  interaction  with  others,  and  utilise  multiple  sources, and strategies in the learning process. Hall6 examined the job rotations as a workplace learning  tool  in  the  Graduate  Trainee  Librarian  Program  at  Flinders  University  Library,  Australia.  The  findings  indicated  that  job  rotation  is  as  much  positively  useful  as  job  training.  Adanu7   studied  continuing  professional development in state-owned university  libraries in Ghana. The study revealed that the work  environment  of  librarians  encouraged  professional  development  leading  to  job  advancement,  and  updated  skills.  The  study  also  pointed  out  that  continuing  professional  development  was  a  shared  responsibility  of  the  library,  and  the  individual. 
Gadagin8   argues  that  explosion  of  knowledge,  and  information  technology  has  virtually  altered  the  characteristics  of  the  learning  environment,  paving  the  way  for  new  learning  experiences.  These  drastic  changes  have  impact  on  the  Library  and  Information  Science  profession  and  leads  to  changes  in  the  continuing  education  system  for  library  professionals.  Rabindra,  Lochan,  &  Dillip9 noted  that  library  professionals  used  to  improve  their skills, and update their knowledge by attending  continuing  professional  development  programmes  such as workshops, seminars, conferences, refresher  courses,  symposiums,  etc.    
Mathew10   observed  that  developments  in  ICT  have  a  positive  influence  on  majority  of  the  library  professionals’ attitude towards continuing education  programmes.  According to Corrall11  staff development  is  ideally  a  shared  responsibility  of  individuals  and  employers.  The  study  shows  that  workplace  learning is being pursued through numerous diverse  routes,  from  conventional  external  courses  and  summer  schools  on  special  interests  to  managed  learning  in  the  workplace.  Bitter-Rijpkema,  Verjans   &  Bruijnzeels12   illustrate  how  learning  at  work  is  understood  to  encompass  a  variety  of  both  formal,  and  informal  elements.  Fontanin13   observed  that  the  e-learning  platform  created  in  university  library  of  Trieste,  Italy,  was  a  successful  attempt  where  library  professionals  explored  the  possibilities  of   Moodle, a Learning Management System, to assist  them  for  workplace  learning.  
3.  OBJECTIVES  
The  main  aim  of  the  study  is  to  assess  the  workplace learning among the library professionals  of  university  libraries  in  Kerala.  To  fulfill  this  aim,  the  following  specific  objectives  were  identified: (a) To  find  out  the  methods  of  workplace  learning  
among  the  library  professionals, 
(b) To assess the skills acquired through workplace  
learning  by  the  library  professionals,  and 
(c) To  analyse  the  factors  that  promoted  or  
hindered  workplace  learning  among  the  library  
professionals. 
4.   METHODOLOGY 
The universe of the study consists of the library  professionals  working  in  the  university  libraries  of  Kerala.  Three  university  libraries,  viz.,  Kerala  University library, Mahatma Gandhi University library,  and  Calicut  University  library  were  selected  for  the  study.  Since  these  are  the  most  prominent  state  universities  in  Kerala  which  are  located  on  south,  middle,  and  north  of  the  State.  There  are  326 library professionals working in these libraries,  and  the  investigators  selected  a  representative  sample  of  100  library  professionals.    Structured  questionnaires  were  used  for  collecting  data.  Out  of  the  100  questionnaires  distributed  among  the  library professionals, 99 were received back.  Among  these,  2  questionnaires  were  found  as  not  usable.  Finally  97  responses  were  selected  for  the  study  with  a  response  rate  of  97  %.  
5.  RESULTS AND   DISCUSSIONS 
5.1  Frequency  of  Workplace  Learning 
Libraries  are  resourceful  in  the  sense  that  there  are  enough  opportunities  for  learning  in  the  workplace  of  libraries.  A  library  professional  can  identify  and  make  use  of  the  facilities  for  informal  learning.  If  a  library  professional  keeps  away  from  continuous  learning  it  may  lead  to  incompetence.  The library professionals were asked to indicate the  frequency of workplace learning and the responses  are  consolidated  in  the  Table  1. 
Table 1. Frequency of workplace learning S. No. Frequency of workplace learningResponses 1. Very often 28 (28.86 %) 2. Often 42 (43.29 %) 3. When required 24 (24.74 %) 4. Rarely 3 (3.09 %) 
Total 97 (100%) 
It is found that a good number of the professionals  engage in workplace learning often.  It indicates that  workplace learning is essential to perform the library  tasks effectively. The adoption of latest Information,  and Communication Technology, increased reliance  on e-resources, and the use of web-based interfaces  for  information  handling  necessitates  the  formal,  and  informal  learning  in  libraries.      
5.2  Reasons  of  Workplace  Learning 
The core purposes for workplace learning identified  from  previous  studies  were  used  to  analyse  the

relative importance assigned to various factors that  necessitate  workplace  learning.  The  professionals  were  asked  to  indicate  the  reasons  for  which  they  engage  in  workplace  learning  and  the  responses  are  given  in  the  Table  2.

The analysis shows that most of the professionals  engage in workplace learning to keep them up-to-date  and to get trained in the latest technologies. This is  very essential to provide value added library services  and  to  perform  their  library  tasks  effectively.      
5.3  Methods  of  Workplace  Learning 
There  are  numerous  methods  and  types  of  activities  which  library  professionals  can  adopt  for  workplace  learning.  The  methods  can  be  broadly  classified into formal and informal.  The professionals  were  asked  about  methods  they  adopt  for  learning  at  the  workplace.  The  responses  are  summarised  in  Table  3.

It is revealed that there are ample opportunities  for formal, and informal learning in libraries.  However,  the library professionals should have a positive attitude  for workplace learning.  All the library professionals  use  the  methods  of  seminars,  and  conferences,  in-house training, attending in continuing education  programmes  for  learning  events.  These  are  the  easiest  way  of  updating  knowledge  in  Library  and  Information  Science.  Visiting  libraries  of  premier  institutes  will  enable  the  library  professionals  to  get  first  hand  information  in  the  adoption  of  latest  technologies.  Online  training  provides  plenty  of  opportunities  to  get  trained  in  latest  technologies,  and  services.  Lack  of  awareness,  and  lack  of  full- fledged  internet  connection  may  be  the  reason  of  the  underutilisation  of  online  training  facilities.  
5.4  Motivators of Workplace Learning 
The  learning  potential  of  library  professionals  depends on numerous factors. Organisational factors  affecting  workplace  learning  include  the  climate  of  libraries,  and  the  managerial  support  from  the  authorities.  These  factors  have  been  identified  as  strong  facilitators  of  workplace  learning14.  If  the  climate  is  healthy,  it  will  attract,  and  motivate  the  talented professionals to adapt to changes, navigate  challenges,  and plan succession more effectively15.  The  library  professionals  were  asked  to  indicate  what  motivates  them  for  workplace  learning,  and  the  responses  are  presented  in  the  Table  4. 
It is found that positive attitude with self motivation  is the major motivator for workplace learning.  However,  support from higher authority, and increased resource  availability is very essential for formal and informal  learning in libraries. Young, and techie professionals  need  challenging  work  environment.  Autonomy  in  work  promotes  job  satisfaction  and  it  will  be  a  motivating  factor  for  workplace  learning.    
5.5  Skills  Acquired  Through  Workplace  
Learning  
Learning nurtures skills. Skills are the backbone  for  professional  success.  To  be  more  effective,  libraries should give training to their professionals and  promote workplace learning.  The library professionals  were requested to indicate the skills they have been  able  to  acquire  through  workplace  learning.  Their  responses  are  given  in  the  Table  5. 
It  is  found  that  workplace  learning  helps  the  professionals  to  acquire  the  skills  of  the  design  and development of digital libraries and institutional  repositories,  e-resources  management,  information  searching, library automation, etc. Library automation  is  the  basic  task  of  the  modernisation  of  libraries.   There  is  no  formal  course  on  library  automation.  Similarly,  the  design  and  development  of  digital

libraries and institutional repositories are the latest  trends in libraries. Networking skill is very essential to  work in an automated online environment. Workplace  learning enables the library professionals for personal  growth  and  performs  their  organisational  tasks  effectively.      
5.6  Membership  in  Online  Discussion  Groups 
Library professionals can use online discussion  groups  and  forums  to  acquire  latest  developments  in  their  fields  and  for  collaborative  learning.    The  subscription to online discussion forums will enhance  workplace learning in the digital environment.  The  library professionals were asked to indicate in which  of  the  online  discussion  groups  they  take  part.  Table  6  shows  the  membership  in  online  groups.

It  is  revealed  that  a  large  majority  of  the  professionals use online media and mailing lists to  up-to-date their knowledge and sharing of information.  These  interfaces  provide  multimedia  facilities  for  information  handling.  Modern  libraries  use  social  media  to  extend  their  value  added  information  services. However, Indian libraries especially university  libraries  are  lagging  behind  in  using  social  media  in  their  libraries.  
5.7  Membership  in  Professional  Organisations 
Professional organisations have vital importance  in  the  professional  growth  of  library  professionals.  Membership  in  professional  bodies  indicates  their  positive attitude towards the profession. The library  professionals were asked to indicate in which of the  
           professional organisations

The analysis shows that the professionals have  membership  in  either  state-level  or  national-level  professional organisations. This is a good indication of  their  professional  involvement  and  commitment.    
5.8  Barriers  of  Workplace  Learning 
There are numerous factors that slow down the  workplace learning in libraries. These factors differ  from  one  library  to  another.  Library  professionals  sometimes  face  situations  that  make  workplace  learning  difficult  like  tight  working  schedule,  poor  
379

infrastructural  facilities,  lack  of  cooperation  from  the  authority,  lack  of  support  from  the  co-workers,  lack  of  awareness  in  modern  learning  techniques,  lack  of  job  rotation  in  libraries  and  so  on.  Job  rotation  is  an  effective  workplace  learning  method  to  promote  employee  learning  as  well  as  employer  learning16,  17.  The  library  professionals  were  asked  to  indicate  the  barriers  of  workplace  learning  and  the  responses  are  summarised  in  the  Table  7. 
It  is  found  that  there  are  barriers  that  hinder  workplace learning in libraries like poor infrastructural

Library professionals engage in workplace learning  if they get professional development  and recognition.  Authorities should provide opportunities and facilities  for  workplace  learning  in  the  libraries.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  positive  attitude  and  support  from  the  co-workers  will  enable  collaborative  workplace  learning  in  libraries.    
6.  CONCLUSIONS 
Workplace  learning  is  an  essential  element  in  the  personal  and  professional  development  of  library  professionals.  It  is  a  key  strategic  element  in  achieving  their  library  objectives,  and  goals.  Library professionals must continue learning in the  workplace,  transforming  the  library  into  a  learning  organisation.  The  inbuilt  learning  environment  in  libraries provides ample opportunities for workplace  learning.  
The  ability  of  library  professionals  to  provide  creative  and  innovative  services  could  depend  on  the  extent  to  which  they  expose  themselves  to  workplace  learning.  Major  findings  shows  that  the  library  professionals  in  universities  in  Kerala  are  engaged  in  very  few  workplace  learning  activities   
380 
and  a  good  number  of  the  professionals  are  of  opinion  that  the  information  sharing  inside  the  libraries  has  to  be  improved.  It  was  also  found  that  lack  of  job  rotation  and  lack  of  recognition  hinder  the  workplace  learning.  Hence  the  study  in  overall  suggests  that  the  current  state-of-the-art  workplace  learning  in  university  libraries  in  Kerala  need  to  be  improved.  As  the  workplace  changes  in  libraries  are  so  quick  and  inevitable,  the  library  professionals  need  to  develop  a  positive  attitude  towards workplace learning. They need to fully exploit
