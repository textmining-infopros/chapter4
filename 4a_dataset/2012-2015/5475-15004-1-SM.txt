 The study analyses India’s performance in social sciences, using different quantitative and qualitative  measures. Its focuses on India’s global publication share, rank and growth rate, citation quality, international  collaborative publications share, its publication share and distribution in various broad and narrow subjects  using 10 years data from the Scopus international multidisciplinary  database. The study indicates that  India  has  great  potential  in  giving  and  sustaining  still  higher  publication  growth  in  social  sciences  in  the  coming  years  as  compared  to  other  countries. Achieving  this  will  depend  in  part  on  the  increased  investment in R&D and in higher education, strengthening the educational and research infrastructure,  increased  deployment  of  qualifed  manpower,  better  interaction  amongst  the  professional  community,  increased  international  cooperation  with  other  countries,  stricter  evaluation  and  monitoring  system  in  promotions, in awarding degrees, research grants, and research projects.

1.  INtRODUctION 
Social  sciences  research  in  India  is  chiefly  driven  by  two  forces:  
(a)  Interest  in  knowledge  about  the  functioning  of  
the society in its diverse social, cultural, political  
and  economic  aspects,  and  in  understanding  
the  factors  that  shape  them;  and  
(b)  Practical needs of policy makers and managers  
in  government,  civil  society  and  the  private  
sector  for  reliable  information  and  professional  
analysis1.  
The  social  science  research  in  India  is  largely  remained  a  state  funded  activity  mainly  funded  by  Government  of  India  and  its  agencies  such  as  the  Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR)  and  University  Grants  Commission  (UGC).  The  Indian Council of Social Science Research was set  up  in  1969  with  the  specific  objective  of  promoting  socio-economic  research  by  establishing  institutes  in  different  parts  of  the  body,  funded  jointly  by  the  central  and  the  state  governments,  to  support  individual research projects and to provide research  fellowship. The UGC also supports research in social  sciences in universities and helped in the funding the  creation and expansion of social science faculties in

the universities and colleges. In addition it initiated  a  program  to  fund  centres  of  advanced  studies  in  the university departments with outstanding faculty  and  special  assistance  programme  to  nurture  and  support promising university departments in different  social  sciences  to  expand  and  strengthen  their  research  capabilities.  
In  the  past  some  bibliometric  studies  have  been  undertaken  on  the  status  of  social  sciences  research2-5. The ICSSR Review Committee Report1  also  assessed  status  of  social  science  research  based on bibliometric analysis sample data published  during  2004-05  in  eight  select  journals  and  on  publications  data  on  books  and  monographs  as  published on social science themes by eight select  publishers.  For  building  a  more  reliable,  objective  and comprehensive picture of social science research  in  India,  it  is  important  to  analyse  research  output  published  in  the  past  10  years. 
2.    ObJEctIVES 
The  main  objectives  of  this  study  are  to  analyse:  
(i) India’s publication output, growth, citation impact  
and  its  global  publications  share  and  rank;

(ii) International collaborative share and identification  
of  leading  collaborating  partners;  
(iii) Publications  output  by  geographical  regions; (iv) Institutional  participation,  and  
(v) Sub-field  wise  distribution  of  its  output    
3.    MEtHODOLOGY  AND  DAtA  SOURcE  
The  study  used  Scopus  database6   to  extract  relevant  data  on  social  science  research  in  India  and  other  most  productive  countries  for  the  past  ten  years  (2001-10).  Scopus  is  the  international  multidisciplinary  database  indexing  18000  peer- reviewed  journals  (including  1800  open  access  journals), besides more than 500 international seminar/ conference proceedings, 400 trade publications and  300 book series. In this analysis, all types of items  included  in  the  database  were  covered.  A  three- year  citation  window  has  been  used  for  counting  the  citations  received  and  to  access  the  impact  of  Indian  research  output.  The  main  search  strategy  string used for generating Indian publications output  in  social  sciences  was  as  follows: 
AFFIL(india)  AND  PUBYEAR  >  2000  AND  PUBYEAR  <  2011AND  (LIMIT-TO  (SUBJAREA,   “SOCI”) OR LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA, “BUSI”) OR LIMIT- TO (SUBJAREA, “DECI”)OR LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA,  “ECON”)  OR  LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA,  “PSYC”)) 
For calculating the total international collaborative  papers in social science, a separate search strategy,  which combines India’s collaboration with 140 countries,  was prepared and this strategy was combined with  the  main  string  and  search  strategy  to  generate  India’s  total  collaborative  papers.  For  analysing  institutional,  city-wise  and  sub-field  wise  output,  separate search strategies were evolved and these  strategies  were  combined  with  the  main  search  strategy  to  generate  the  desired  output. 
4.    ANALYSES

India  has  published  21671  papers  in  social  sciences during 2001-10. The annual Indian output  in  social  sciences  grew  from  1208  papers  in  2001  to 4321 papers in 2010, showing an annual average  growth rate of 17.66 %. India ranks at 12th  position  in  overall  social  sciences  among  the  top  15  most  productive  countries  with  1.18%  global  publication  share  during  2001-10.  India’s  global  publication  share  in  social  sciences  increased  from  0.94  %  to  1.34 % from 2001-05 to 2006-10. The average Indian  citation impact per paper in overall social sciences  was  1.54  during  2001-10,  which  increased  from  1.47  during  2001-05  to  1.57  during  2006-10.  The  international  collaborative  papers  share  of  India  in  overall Social sciences during 2001-10 was 16.18 %  during  2001-10,  which  increased  from  14.04  %  during  2001-05  to  17.10  %  during  2006-10.  
India has great potential in giving and sustaining  still  higher  publication  growth  in  social  sciences  in  the  coming  years.  The  country  needs  to  build  up  its  research  capacity,  competence  and  knowledge  base  to  help  in  bridging  the  gap  with  leading  countries.  Achieving  this  will  depend  in  part  on  the  increased  investment  in  R&D  and  in  higher  education, strengthening the educational and research  infrastructure,  increased  deployment  of  qualified  manpower, better interaction amongst the professional  community, increased international cooperation with  other  countries,  stricter  evaluation  and  monitoring  system in promotions, in awarding degrees, research  grants and research projects. The research capacity  in the universities can be further improved in terms  of computing and other infrastructure, course content,  teaching methods, faculty development in emerging  sub-fields, allocation of funds in specialised areas,  and  by  attracting  bright  talent  at  Masters’  and  Doctorate level. This must be accompanied by strict  criteria for the students for PhD programs and their  evaluation  for  the  degree  and  in  faculty  evaluation  for  time  scale  promotion.
