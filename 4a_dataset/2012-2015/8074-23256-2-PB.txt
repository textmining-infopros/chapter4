Information resources are available in various kinds of media and forms. To describe them there exists  number of diverse metadata standards and schema. Metadata is crucial for preservation and archiving,  organisation, resource discovery and information retrieval across platforms. As one metadata standard  cannot be applicable for all the emerging media and document formats, a combination of them is used.  In this context the present paper presents an overview on types of metadata standards and schemas,  and  also  discusses  on  the  issues  and  challenges  in  metadata  creation,  management,  interoperability,  
and resource discovery.  
Keywords: Metadata,  metadata  diversity,  diverse  digital  forms,  interoperability,  resource  discovery,

1.    IntRoDuCtIon 
The World Wide Web is repertoire of information  resources available in diverse formats and is growing  at  an  exponential  rate.  This  huge  availability  of  information resources led to the problem of finding  potentially useful documents. Metadata, the structured  data about information sources, is a key to retrieve  relevant information that provides meaningful access  points for the searchers. Paradoxically, the metadata  is  both  a  key  and  an  obstacle  in  finding  relevant  information.  In  the  recent  years  the  content  in  the  scholarly  materials  has  expanded  beyond  the  text  realm  to  diverse  resources  such  as  multimedia,  artistic  and  creative  works,  grey  literature  and  research  data  including  trends  and  reviews.  The  scope and purpose of metadata differ among different  knowledge  communities  and  institutions  such  as  information managers and scientists, IT professionals,  government agencies, learning institutions, cultural  and heritage organisations, publishers, businesses,  legal  community  and  many  more.  There  exists  different metadata schemas and standards that are  best suited to their purposes and priorities to meet  their needs. The present paper discusses the diverse  metadata  schemas  and  standards,  interoperability  and  resource  discovery,  issues  and  challenges.  
2.    MetADAtA 
Metadata  is  the  descriptive  and  classification  information  about  digital  object  or  digital  resource  
such  as  web  page,  a  computer  file,  an  image,  multimedia  document,  etc.  It  describes  the  who,  what, when, where, why, and how about a data set  or  resource.  Metadata  gives  complete  description  about  a  digital  object,  and  is  crucial  for  preserving  and  sharing  such  resources.  Besides,  providing  information  it  helps  the  search  engines  and  other  discovery  channels  in  discovering  and  reporting  the  usefulness  of  the  resources  thereby  helps  the  searcher  in  selecting  the  best.  While  identifying  the core metadata elements, the focus should also  be  made  on  how  to  share  this  data  with  other  collections,  catalogues  and  systems  to  maximise  the  potential  use  and  re-use  of  resources. 
According  to  Natasa a  metadata  framework1 can  be  viewed  as  having  five  key  components:  (i)  Schema-deals  with  elements  and  categories  of  information  to  be  chosen  for  recording,  (ii)  Vocabulary-collection  of  the  specific  words  and  their  values  chosen  for  the  defined  categories,  (iii)  Conceptual  model-framework  which  describes  how  different concepts of information are related to each  other (iv) Content standard-practical way of recording  the specific information (e.g. vocabularies) are entered  within metadata schema categories (e.g. cataloguing  cultural  objects),  and  (v)  Encoding-concerned  with  the  way  the  metadata  is  presented  (e.g.  XML). 2.1  Metadata standards  and schemas

while practicing they obtain consensus following all  the formalities such as submissions, approvals and  publishing  of  new  elements,  and  when  ratified  by  professional  organisations  they  become  metadata  standards.  
According to NISO, a metadata schema3  consists  of a set of elements designed for a specific purpose,  such  as  describing  a  particular  type  of  information  resource. Report of the American Library Association  Committee on Cataloguing : Description and Access,  Task  Force  on  Metadata  (CC:DA  2000)  states  that  a  metadata  schema4   provides  a  formal  structure  designed to identify the knowledge structure of a given  discipline and to link that structure to the information  of the discipline through the creation of an information  system  that  will  assist  the  identification,  discovery,  and  use  of  information  within  that  discipline. 
The  word  ‘schema’  usually  regarded  as  an  ‘element set’ refers to an entire entity including the  semantic  and  content  components,  as  well  as  the  encoding  of  the  elements  with  a  markup  language  such  as  SGML  (Standard  Generalized  Markup  Language) and XML (Extensible Markup Language).  A metadata element set has two basic components5:  (i)  Semantics-definitions  of  the  meanings  of  the  elements and their refinements (ii) Content-declarations  or  instructions  of  what  and  how  values  should  be  assigned  to  the  elements. 
2.2  need  for  Diverse  Metadata  standards  and  
schema 
Recently, it has been observed that many scholars  like to publish their research work in online e-journals,  web forums and scientific datasets. The communities  and content providers in the areas of sciences, social  sciences,  e-commerce  and  business  management,  medical  sciences,  life  sciences,  biodiversity,  space  sciences,  museums,  etc.,  are  on  constant  lookout  for  refinements  and  agreements  in  the  semantics  of  specialised  metadata  to  enable  new  formats  internationally. As libraries and information centres,  museums digitise cultural heritage information, must  create  metadata  to  organise  and  manage  it  in  the  consumer world, metadata exists in the form of ratings  and reviews; metadata to support medical sciences  and  rights  management  will  be  an  essential  part.  A  metadata  type  which  is  applicable  for  all  kinds  of  information  resources,  knowledge  communities,  and  applications  does  not  exist.  
2.3 types  of  Metadata standards  and  
schemas 
With  so  many  diverse  formats  of  documents  or  digital  objects,  type  of  user  community,  type  of  institutions existing, unfortunately, a unique definitive  metadata standard does not exist. Metadata schemes  are  the  sets  of  metadata  elements  designed  for  
194 
a  specific  purpose.  Each  scheme  has  a  limited  number of elements, with meaning of each element  specifying the content/syntax rules. The following is  not  the  exhaustive  list  of  the  metadata  standards  and  schemas:

3.    Issues  AnD   Ch Allenges 
3.1  Creation  and  Management  of  Metadata  
Librarians and indexers6  are the specialists who  usually create metadata, but recently the non-specialists  such  as  users  and  publishers  are  also  generating  metadata which sometimes is not able to match the  standards  required  for  information  retrieval.  Some  wizards and IT tools can be made available in such  cases so that the non-specialists enter metadata in  a right way. Many word processors and text editors  automatically perform the document analysis, filters,  extract  and  generate  metadata  values  themselves  and  embed  metadata  tags  when  the  document  is  created  for  the  first  time  and  metadata  is  updated  when  modifications  or  conversions  take  place.  The  guidelines  on  how,  who  and  when,  to  write  or  remove  metadata,  has  to  be  mentioned  clearly  in  the  form  of  declarative  rules  and  prescriptions.  If  not  the  case  then  the  quality  and  effectiveness  of  such  metadata  becomes  questionable  and  such  tools  have  to  be  included  and  used  extensively  in  heterogeneous  environments  to  get  consensus.  
3.2  Identifying  Core  Metadata  elements-types  
of  Metadata 
The primary challenge is to identify fundamental  elements needed to describe a resource which are  termed  as  the  core  elements.  Such  identified  core  elements should describe the origin, composition and  navigation, confidentiality, legitimacy and recognition,  quality  and  longevity,  terms  and  conditions,  of  digital  objects. 
3.2.1 Administrative  Metadata 
The information pertaining to the management,  organisation,  provision  and  method  of  access  is  described  for  digital  collections  in  the  form  of  administrative metadata. It also provides information  about preservation, legal rights, ownership and usage  restrictions. METS Rights and MPEG’s Rights Data  Dictionary7  (RDD) are excellent schemas for describing  intellectual property rights of a digital object in detail.  reservation metadata provides information pertaining  
to  provenance,  authenticity,  preservation  activities,  and  other  technical  details.  The  PREMIS  schema  stands for PREservation Metadata: Implementation  Strategies, is a data dictionary for metadata elements  which  supports  XML  schema  in  different  contexts,  has  been  designed  and  developed  for  sustainable  and  long  term  preservation  of  digital  objects.  
3.2.2  Structural  Metadata 
Structural metadata deals with information relating  to  the  internal  organisation  of  digital  resources.  For  example  chapters  in  a  book  -  indicates  how  compound objects are put together, i.e., how pages  are  ordered  to  form  chapters.  Structural  metadata  provides structural relation information with other parent  or family files and how the metadata relates to the  file,  thereby  facilitates  navigation  and  presentation  of  electronic  resources.  
For  example,  the  audio  files  created  in  analog  media  such  as  magnetic  tape  are  contextually  related to each other and has to be examined while  providing  structural  metadata.  The  audio  files  are  recorded  in  different  tracks  and  takes  on  a  tape  hence  information  about  other  tracks  and  takes  has  to  be  referred  in  the  metadata  along  with  the  resources.  The  metadata  about  time  based  media  files should also include accurate information about  the  location  points  and  markers  to  identify  and  locate  the  significant  content.  In  case  of  individual  files  within  multi-track  arrangements,  the  exact  pan  location  should  be  included  in  the  structural  metadata.  In  case  of  a  digital  excerpt  of  a  larger  file  the  metadata  about  the  resources  should  be  shown  in  as  broader  context  as  possible  like  an  ordered  family  tree.  
3.2.3  Technical  Metadata 
The  technical  qualities  of  a  digital  object  are  described  in  technical  metadata.  The  technical  information such as channel number, bit-depth, sampling  rate,  frames  per  second,  unique  file  identifier,  etc.  AudioMD and VideoMD are an XML-based schema  and  are  extension  schemas  of  METS  developed  by  LOC.  A  group  within  the  Audio  Engineering  Society  is  working  on  digital  library  and  archive  system  issues;  specifically,  on  audio  preservation  and restore. The audio metadata standard they are  developing  is  called  AES-X0988.  The  work  of  the  group  has  parts:  (a)  descriptive  metadata  and  (b)  for  administrative  metadata  to  document  what  are  called  ‘process  history’  and  ‘audio  object’  3.2.4  Descriptive  Metadata 
Descriptive metadata includes curatorial information  such as name of the file, creator, associated dates,  description, summary, locations etc., is the primary  source for the users to access. This provides content-and  
195 

========3========

DJLIT,  VOL.  35,  NO.  3,  MAy  2015 
context-related specific information of an information  resource  useful  in  its  discovery  and  identification.  Content  metadata  includes  data  about  the  content  of  an  information  resource  such  as  subject  terms  and  titles,  Context  metadata  deals  with  the  data  related to the context of an information resource, or  data  about  the  creation  of  that  information  source.  Either  the  elements  in  Simple  DC9,10   metadata  set  can be used directly or an alternative is the MODS  for  providing  descriptive  metadata.  
There  are  two  descriptive  metadata  models:  (i)  Separate  metadata  model  and  (ii)  Embedded  metadata model. In the separate metadata model the  metadata is stored in a database linked to resource  via some type of locating descriptive metadata such  as URL as a separate HTML document linked to the  resource  it  describes.  In  the  embedded  metadata  model,  the  descriptive  metadata  is  taken  as  part  of the information they consist of. The metadata is  embedded  in  the  web  page  by  the  creator  using  meta  tags  in  the  HTML  coding  of  the  page,  i.e.,  between  the  <HEAD>  and  </HEAD>  tags.  
3.3  Metadata  for  Institutional  Repositories  
and  Information services 
Metadata also exists in various formats such as  market reviews, ratings bureaus, critics, discussion  forums, blogs, etc. Access to metadata from institutional  repositories  is  either  restricted  or  limited  because  of  various  reasons.  Research  and  designing  of  effective mechanisms for such types of repositories  is required. In case of services, the data is dynamic  such as weather forecasts which cannot be accessed  by an external web harvester. Describing particular  domains  of  resources  such  as  intellectual  property  restrictions,  geospatial  coordinates,  geostationary  satellite  imagery,  aerial  photographs,  etc.,  require  specific models to be developed by associating general  models  of  metadata  such  as  RDF.  This  practical  and flexible association supports the amalgamation  of  varied  resources  into  coherent  collections.  For  example,  the  Federal  Geographic  Data  Committee  Content  Standard11   describes  specialised  aspects  of  geospatial  data,  while  a  more  general  model  is  used  to  associate  that  data  with  related  non- geospatial  resources. 
3.4  Metadata  for  Complex  Digital  Resources 
There are well-established conceptual models and  procedures for describing the contents and structure  of  traditional  resources  such  as  text  documents.  Whereas in case of collections of documents, time- based  media,  and  dynamically  generated  objects,  describing the intellectual contents and structure of  resources  where  variety  of  encodings  are  existing,  is less understood and far more complex, however  there  are  few  conventions  in  general  use.  Library  
196 
of  Congress  has  evolved  audioMD  and  videoMD12  schemas  for  time-based  media  such  as  audio  and  video  which  need  ‘mechanical’  metadata  for  controlling processes such as synchronisation (e.g.,  sampling  rates  and  frame  sizes),  and  linked  to  higher-level  descriptive  and  mechanical  metadata  through  abstractions.  
The  audioMD12   schema  allows  for  detailing  properties  such  as:  (i)  physical  format  for  media- dependent  materials  (e.g.,  open  reel  tape,  DAT,  instantaneous  disc)  (ii)  track  format  for  magnetic  tape recordings (iii) groove type for analog discs (iv)  speed  and  speed  adjustment  for  analog  materials  (v)  number  of  channels  and  sound  channel  map  (vi)  sampling  frequency  and  bits  per  sample  for  digital recordings (vii) audio data encoding for digital  materials and (viii) file format name and version for  media  independent  digital  materials. 
The  videoMD12 schema  allows  for  detailing  properties  such  as  (i)  physical  format  for  media  dependent  materials  (e.g.,  stock  brand,  base  and  binder for magnetic tapes, disc surface type for disc  media) (ii) dimensions for media dependent materials  (e.g.,  diameter,  gauge,  height,  thickness,  width,  length)  (iii)  generation  for  analog  media  (iv)  frame  description (e.g., pixel or line counts horizontal and  vertical, frame rate) (v) data rate (may be expressed  in  terms  of  maximum,  minimum,  nominal,  mode)  (vi)  format  in  terms  of  broadcast  standards  (e.g.,  NTSC, PAL, SECAM) (vii) formatting description for  digital materials (e.g., name of creating application,  commercial  name  of  format,  profile,  version)  and  (viii)  bits  per  sample  and  sampling  description  in  terms  of  chrominance  and  luminance  (e.g.,  4:2:2,  4:2:0). 
The metadata for the files store in MPEG-7 format  includes information regarding low level descriptions  and  high  level  descriptions.  It  includes  various  basic, spectral, signal and temporal parameters and  information pertaining to terms and conditions, ratings,  encoding formats, and scenarios of how multimedia  components are combined in presentations. A multimedia  content description interface (MPEG-7)13  technology  covers the most recent developments in multimedia  search  and  retrieval,  designed  to  standardise  the  description of multimedia and related formats content  supporting  a  wide  range  of  applications  including  DVD,  CD  and  HDTV. 
  The  publications  produced  in  emerging  kinds  of digital media needs metadata in several aspects  such  as  encoding  format,  publication  type,  access  controls,  description,  terms  and  conditions  of  use,  supporting versions, etc. The metadata information  in  case  of  collections  of  images  and  manuscript  archives  has  to  be  different  with  that  of  the  items  in  that  collection  which  further  help  in  navigation  and  discovering  specific  databases.

RAMESH, et al.: METADATA DIVERSITy, INTEROPERABILITy  AND RESOURCE DISCOVER y  ISSUES AND CHALLENGES 
3.5 simplicity,  Complexity,  and  Interoperability 
The  efforts  for  research  in  the  area  of  mixing  and  matching  separate  metadata  schemas,  local  refinements,  specifying  interrelations  among  the  modules  for  simplifying  the  things  in  distributed  computing environment is necessary if consistency is  to be achieved and reduces issues in interoperability.  Search engines extract metadata using statistical and  algorithmic methods rather than deriving intellectually  using semantic analysis methods. There should be  a clear understanding of models and strike balance  between the simplicity, interoperability, and semantic  richness  in  the  metadata  schemas.  
For  example,  in  case  of  e-commerce  the  stuff  is  complex,  metadata  is  modular  and  is  made  up  of  connecting  pieces  created  by  different  people.  INDECS  (INteroperability  of  Data  in  E-Commerce  Systems)14,  is  a  metadata  initiative  for  supporting  global commerce in intellectual property. Functional  Requirements  for  Bibliographic  Records15   of  the  International  Federation  of  Library  Associations  and  Institutions  (IFLA)16,  describes  a  range  of  possible  ‘states’  for  information  resources  from  the  abstract  work  through  the  physical  item.  PICS  (Platform  for  Internet  Content  Selection)  and  P3P  (Platform for Privacy Preferences) are the standards  intended  to  provide  information  on  privacy  and  rating services. The challenge ahead is to define a  logical  framework17   which  subsumes  or  reconciles  a  variety  of  data  models  with  implications  for  the  switching  and  reuse  of  variety  of  metadata  types  for  a  broad  range  of  applications. 
3.6    Interoperability  and  Resource  Discovery  
  Mapping,  Crosswalking  and  Registries 
 Interoperability 
18 
 is achieved among networked  services and heterogeneous metadata when common  conventions  on  semantics  and  syntax  are  agreed  and  adopted.  Sharing  common  set  of  elements  and  modifying  them  to  local  requirements  across  multiple schemas achieves semantic interoperability,  whereas  syntactic  interoperability  is  possible  by  strict adherence to standard metadata formats and  protocols  while  creating  metadata  structures  and  possible  only  through  metadata  deployment.  The  underlying  encoding  syntax  in  RDF  is  XML  which  supports  exchange  of  metadata  on  the  web.  
Mappings  are  the  relationships  between  the  elements of two metadata standards support access  and information transfer across domains. The schemas  have  significantly  different  syntaxes  or  semantics.  The  metadata  element  in  one  schema  is  linked  /  mapped  with  metadata  element  in  another  schema  by  choosing  a  direct  element  if  exists  or  a  near  element  if  not  exists.  This  technique  is  extremely  useful when mapping old legacy data elements with  
the  new  management  system  or  data.  UKOLN,  an  agent for knowledge transfer contains list of existing  mappings between many popular schemas which is  enormously  used.  Crosswalks19   are  more  complex  frameworks that establish the relationship between  schemas  based  on  thesauri  or  ontologies.  
Semantic  interoperability  depends  on  accurate  association of data elements with semantically-related  terms  within  and  among  systems.  This  is  possible  with semantics register20  in which the data elements  and  attributes  of  documents  along  with  meaning  and  certain  other  assertions  are  maintained.  
In such registries the elements of different metadata  schemas  are  entered  in  machine  readable  syntax  along  with  the  authoritative  listings  of  their  legal  values, local extensions and modifications, mappings  to other schemas, and also guidelines and procedures  on how to use them. The structured content in these  registries  perform  like  knowledge  bases  which  is  both human and machine understandable, persuade  and  endorse  the  use  of  such  standards  formats.  Registries21  support the translation of metadata into  other languages and schemas, validation, and updating  of  remote  metadata  to  new  versions  automatically.  Constructions used in alliance of thesauri, such as  ‘interlinguas’,  could  be  personalised  for  relating  ontologies  of  metadata.  
The Common Object Request Broker Architecture  (CORBA)  is  a  standard  defined  by  the  Object  Management  Group  (OMG)  designed  to  facilitate  the  communication  of  systems  that  are  deployed  on  diverse  platforms.  This  enables  applications  to  manipulate distributed computing objects; DOI22, and  the  Z39.50  protocol  for  information  retrieval.  
3.7  Information  Policies  and  Management 
There  are  international  implications  in  moving  content  and  metadata  between  communities  and  across  international  boundaries.  The  information  managers should take into account of international  implications  especially  when  metadata  crosses  borders  and  jurisdictions.  
3.8  Integrity,  Accuracy,  and  Authenticity  of  
Metadata 
A few content providers are submitting irrelevant  index terms to the web indexing services23,24  to get  more  visibility  for  their  content  on  the  search. This  has  led  to  apprehensions  and  assertions  about  the  content  on  the  network  making  it  increasingly  necessary  to  verify  its  correctness,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness.  Removing  misapprehensions  and  assertions  on  metadata  particularly  in  case  of  ratings  or  subject  analysis  is  a  big  challenge  and  the  solution  is  to  design  and  develop  algorithms  and  heuristics.  However  sampling  and  analysis  
197

DJLIT,  VOL.  35,  NO.  3,  MAy  2015 
of  metadata  usage  patterns  serve  as  a  guide  for  developers  of  schemas  and  provide  feedback  into  the  design  of  core  metadata  sets  and  purposeful  packages. 
4.  ConClusI ons 
There is no unique metadata standard sufficient  to  describe  all  the  documents  emerging  in  various  kinds  of  formats,  helpful  in  efficient  information  retrieval. Intense and long term research in this area  is  necessary  and  possible  if  metadata  specialists  and user communities are involved, negotiated, build  consensus  and  try  to  solve  functional  problems,  particularly in the areas of data organisation, archiving  and preservation, rights management and resource  discovery of growing networked information sources.  Registries  are  also  an  important  area  of  research.  There is an urgent need to find one unique metadata  standard to provide the emerging global information  infrastructure with coherent methods of organisation  and access that transcend the historical boundaries  of  nations,  languages,  and  cultures.
