ABSTRACT 
Information has gained importance in every sector of societies and health sector is not an exception.  Health science professionals need information for conducting their activities related to human care, academic  and research pursuits, thus providing library and information support to the health professionals has gained  importance. Different health science information systems are associated with health-related institutions like  medical colleges, hospitals etc. For managing these information systems on professional and scientifc  lines, library professionals play an important role. Realising the importance of LIS professionals in health  sector, departments of library and information science have introduced different specialised papers. Health  science information system is one such specialisation introduced in the library and information science  discipline with the aim to produce competent professionals with suffcient skills, knowledge and attitude  for managing the libraries and information systems in the health sector. The different components of the  curriculum of health science information system is the focus of the present paper. Challenges posed to  health science information professionals by the changing information landscape are also highlighted.

1. INTRodUCTIoN  
The  institution  known  as  library  is  very  old,  as  old  as  our  modern  civilization  and  its  history  is  interwoven  with  the  history  of  civilizations  itself.  Yet its nature, scope, operations and services have  not  always  been  what  they  are  today.  It  began  as  a  repository  to  conserve  what  was  recorded  in  a  format  called  clay  tablet.  These  formats  changed  from  time  to  time  with  the  development  of  other  formats  settling  finally  with  print  on  paper  as  book  and later journals, patents, etc. were added. Of late  digital  and  cyber-media  is  almost  replacing  print  media  in  publishing  books,  journals  and  others.   Libraries as social institutions have been serving end  users by identifying, selecting, acquiring, organising,  preserving  and  disseminating  of  information.  In  the  past  libraries  were  regarded  as  store  houses  and  custodial  houses  for  the  documents  focusing  more  on  preservation  of  document  than  use  of  document.  Ranganathan  labelled  these  ancient  libraries as concentration camps for the documents1.  However,  with  advances  in  educational,  political,  economic, technological, social, commercial and like  other  sectors  of  the  societies,  information  gained  importance  and  is  regarded  as  fuel  in  the  overall

progress and prosperity of the societies. Information  and  knowledge  are  now  regarded  as  power  that  can have its effects on the economics, politics and  like  other  sectors  of  the  societies.  Libraries  thus  gained importance and were established in different  sectors  of  the  societies.  With  the  passage  of  time,  it was realised that a single library cannot fulfil the  information  needs  and  requirements  of  the  all  the  people,  thus  different  types  of  libraries  came  up  with  the  following  nomenclatures: 
• Academic  libraries 
• Public  libraries 
• National  libraries,  and  
• Special  libraries  
Developments  in  the  universe  of  knowledge  have gradually affected different facets of libraries.   Organisation of resources, operations and services  provided  by  libraries  began  to  grow  complex.  With  the  increasing  complexity  of  different  facets  of  libraries  and  information  centres,  the  need  for  competent  and  capable  professionals  was  felt  by  the  authorities  of  these  libraries,  thus  emerged  the  concept  of  establishing  library  and  information

schools  for  generating  human  resources  equipped  with  appropriate  knowledge  and  skills  necessary  for managing the libraries and information centres.  LIS  schools  started  imparting  diffrent  courses  in  the  discipline  of  library  and  in  formation  science.  Some  of  the  courses  are: 
(a)  Bachelor  of  Library  and  Information  
Science  (BLIS)  
This  is  a  one-year  degree  course  conducted  
• by universities after students graduate with a basic  degree.  However,  in  some  colleges,  LIS  is  offered  
• as an optional subject at the Bachelor of Arts level.  • For  this,  the  students  opt  for  LIS  as  one  of  the  optional  paper,  along  with  other  optional  papers  in  
• social  sciences  or  the  humanities.  
(b) Master  of  Library  and  Information  Science  
(MLIS)  
seven modules. Some of the specialised information  systems  as  enumerated  by  UGC  model  curriculum  published  in  2001  are: 
• Health  information  system 
• Business  information  system 
• Agricultural  information  system 
• Social  science  information  system 
Environmental  information  system 
Legal  information  system 
Industrial  information  system 
Archival,  museum  information  system 
• Biotechnology  information  system 
• Rural  information  system 
The  general  objectives  of  these  specialised

information  systems  are  to: 
with  duration  of  one  year.  However,  many  of  the  
• universities,  which  were  initially  offering  BLIS  and  MLIS  truncated  courses,  have  now  switched  over  to  a  two-year  integrated  MLISc  course.      
• 
(c) Postgraduate  (PG)  diploma  Course      
PG  courses  in  some  selected  LIS  areas  of  • specialization  are  offered  at  the  university  level  as  a  one-year  course,  e.g.,  PGDLAN  and  PGDM  offered  by  IGNOU  and  BHU,  respectively. 
(d) Associateship  in  Information  Science      
Since  1964,  the  Indian  National  Scientific  Documentation  Centre  (INSDOC  now  NISCAIR)  
• New  Delhi  is  offering  Associateship  in  Information  Science  (AIS).  
(e) MPhil  Programme

Health-related information has gained importance  in the contemporary world for enhancing and improving  the health conditions of the human population. Lack  
of  access  to  information  remains  a  major  barrier

for  admission  is  MLIS.  
2. SPeCIALISATIoN IN   LIS  S CHooLS 
To  produce  skilled  manpower  for  the  libraries  and  information  centers,  concept  of  specialisation  is  now  in  vogue  in  the  discipline  of  LIS.  In  India  University  Grants  Commission  (UGC)  is  taking  care  of  higher  education  including  the  discipline  of  LIS.  Authorities  at  UGC2   have  published  a  Model  Curriculum in LIS in 2012. In this model curriculum,  the  concept  of  specialised  information  systems  has  been  introduced  as  one  module  among  the  
100 
as  a  system  that  requires  cooperation  among  a  wide  range  of  professionals  including  healthcare  providers,  policy  makers,  researchers,  publishers,  information professionals, indexers, and systematic  reviewers3.              
Healthy societies depend upon so many factors  like availability of infrastructure in the health-related  institutions  like  hospitals,  competent  and  capable  medical  professionals  and  paraprofessionals,  etc.  Availability and accessibility to authoritative, reliable,  relevant, accurate, up-to-date and timely information  is  playing  a  very  important  role  in  enhancing  the

quality  of  care  in  any  society.  People  involved  in  the health sciences like doctors, nurses, technicians;  pharmacists  etc.  all  are  in  need  of  information  at  every  stage  of  their  activities  in  order  to  perform  their  jobs  efficiently.  Realising  the  importance  of  information  in  the  health  sector,  different  libraries  and  information  centers  has  been  set  up,  in  order  to  ensure  right  information  to  the  right  person  at  the  right  time.  Thus,  Health  Science  Information  System (HIS) has gained importance in the present  information  landscape.  The  HIS  can  be  defined  as  “a  set  of  components  and  procedures  organised  with  the  objective  of  generating  information  which  will improve healthcare management decisions at all  levels of the health system”4.

(f) Library  support  to  health  science 
In health sector there exist a number of libraries  wholly and solely devoted to the acquisition, processing,  preservation  and  dissemination  of  health  related  information.  These  libraries  are  not  only  in  India  but  also  in  other  countries  of  the  world.  In  order  to  provide  sufficient  knowledge  to  the  students  about  these  different  libraries,  LIS  curriculum  has  included  following  libraries: 
• National  Library  of  Medicine  (USA)  
• National  Medical  Library  (New  Delhi) • WHO  Library 
(g) Management  of  health  information  system 
The  curriculum  included  the  following  library  management  components: 
• Collection Development and Management’ adopted  
by  five  departments  
• ‘Financial  Management’  adopted  by  only  two  
departments  
• ‘Human  Resource  Management’  included  by  
three  departments  
• ‘Service  Management’  included  by  five  
departments  
• ‘Library  Organisation’  accommodated  by  only  
two  departments.  
• ‘Resource Sharing and Networking’ adopted by  
four  departments. 
7.2  discussions  
in  the  health  sciences.  Web  2.0,  with  its  flexibility,  low cost and potential for collaboration and sharing  would seem to offer ideal opportunities to enhance  the provision of information to healthcare deliverers  and recipients alike. Technologies are changing with  fast  pace  and  librarians,  information  professionals  are supposed to keep track with these developments.  Library  and  information  professionals  are  having  this  responsibility  to  make  their  users  acquainted  with  these  new  technologies  through  information  literacy programs. How to conduct these information  literacy  programmes  must  be  known  to  the  library  and  information  professionals.  Thus  information  literacy should be given enough space in the health  science  curriculum  by  concerned  authorities.  It  is  also  suggested  that  advanced  training  in  health  librarianship is to be introduced in all the universities  in  LIS  curriculum  as  an  optional  course  to  cater  and  strengthen  the  specialised  discipline.  
8. CoNCLUSIoNS 
Health information system has been recognised  an  essential  component  in  providing  quality  health  care  services  in  a  society.  Managing  these  HIS  is  the responsibility of the professionals who deal with  different aspects of information. The LIS schools are  having  responsibility  to  revise  the  HIS  curriculum  regularly to delete obsolete topics and accommodate  the most relevant emerging topics. While framing the  curriculum, expert advice from the real practitioners  (Health  Science  information  professionals)  should  also  be  given  due  consideration.  Developments  taking place in the health science information at the  global  level  may  also  be  tracked  and  the  positive
