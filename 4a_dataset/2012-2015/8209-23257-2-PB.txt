ABSTRACT 
This  paper  attempts  to  know  how  library  authorities  are  detecting  the  confict  among  the  library  staff, and resolving the same confict, the steps taken to overcome the confict situations and others. A  survey  method  was  used  and  random  sampling  to  get  the  primary  data  for  the  study.  Majority  of    the  respondents accepted for some moderate extent that they will allow medical/maternity/paternity leave to  
resolve the confict.

1.  IntroduCtIon 
In most conflicts, neither party is right or wrong;  instead,  different  perceptions  collide  to  create  disagreement.  Conflict  is  natural  and  it's  up  to  the  person you to respond to conflict situations quickly  and  professionally.  Conflict  can  be  very  positive;  if  one  deals  with  it  openly,  one  can  strengthen  his/ her  work  unit  by  correcting  problems.  Conflicting  views  give  a  chance  to  learn  more  about  oneself,  explore  views  of  others,  and  develop  productive  relationships. Clear and open communication is the  cornerstone  of  successful  conflict  resolution1.  It  is  quite common wherever there are people, there will  always  be  conflict,  may  it  be  library  professionals  or  others.  Managers  have  to  deal  with  conflict  in  the  work  place  every  day.  
Conflict  management  is  the  ability  to  be  able  to  identify  and  handle  conflicts  sensibly,  fairly,  and  efficiently. Success lies in unity to achieve a library  goals,  to  provide  good  services  to  become  modal  library to other libraries team work of librarian staff is  must and essential. If any conflicts, misunderstandings  develops in librarian and other staff it is very difficult  to run library activities smoothly and successfully. To  overcome  these  problems  librarian  should  develop  the  strategies  should  detect  why  conflict  is  arising  what is the best way to resolve a personal conflict of  a subordinates how to maintain a good relationship  among  library  staff. 
While  there  is  no  single  definition  of  conflict  exists, most definitions involve the following factors:  there are at least two independent groups, the groups  perceive some incompatibility between themselves,  and  the  groups  interact  with  each  other  in  some  way2.  Even  conflict  management  is  the  practice  of  being able to identify and handle conflicts sensibly,  fairly,  and  efficiently.  Since  conflicts  in  a  business  are  a  natural  part  of  the  workplace,  it  is  important  that there are people who understand conflicts and  know  how  to  resolve  them.  This  is  important  in  today's market more than ever. Everyone is striving  to show how valuable they are to the company they  work  for  and,  at  times,  this  can  lead  to  disputes  with  other  members  of  the  team.

LIterature  revIew 
Not  much  research  has  been  done  libraries  in  the region of Karnataka. Lee, Hong & Avgar4  made  a  study  that  extends  strategic  human  resource  management  research  by  focusing  on  the  effects  of  high-involvement  work  practices  (HIWPs)  on  relational  outcomes  with  customers.  This  provide  evidence that relational dynamics among employees  act  as  a  mediating  mechanism  for  the  relationship  between  workplace  practices  and  these  outcomes.  In  particular,  they  propose  that  human  resource  management practices designed to increase employees  involvement at work reduce the level of organizational  conflict  among  employees,  which,  in  turn,  affect

employees'  conflict  with  their  customers  and  their  families.  Using  a  two-wave  longitudinal  survey  of  378  patient  care  providers  at  20  nursing  homes,  the  authors  argue  that  the  effect  of  HIWPs  on  conflict  between  nursing  home  staff  and  patients  and  their  family  members  is  mediated  by  task  and  relationship  conflict  among  employees.  The  results  provide  strong  support  for  the  mediating  role of organisational conflict among employees by  documenting  that  the  negative  effect  of  HIWPs  on  employees'  conflict  with  patients  and  their  families  is  mediated  by  the  reduced  levels  of  task  conflict  and  relationship  conflict  among  employees.  
Saeed5 examined  the  relationship  between  leadership  styles  and  conflict  management  styles  among  managers,  while  handling  interpersonal  conflict  (mangers  and  subordinates).  Middle-level  managers from different private sector manufacturing  industries were included. findings were that managers  who  perceived  to  exhibit  more  on  transformational  leadership  style  adopted  integrating  and  obliging  style of conflict management. Those who perceived  to  exhibit  more  on  transactional  style  opted  for  compromising style of conflict management. Whereas,  managers perceived to exhibit laissez-faire leadership  style  adopted  avoiding  style  to  manage  conflicts  with  subordinates. 
Coleman  &  Kugler6   developed  a  new  measure  for  assessing  conflict  adaptivity  of  managers  [the  Managerial Conflict Adaptivity Assessment (MCAA)],  based  on  a  situated  model  of  conflict  in  social  relations.  They  defined  conflict  adaptivity  as  the  capacity  to  respond  to  different  conflict  situations  in  accordance  with  the  demands  specified  by  the  situation.  Schulze,  Stade  &  Netzel7   highlighted  research on social conflicts in innovation processes  has  been  rare,  leaving  an  important  research  gap,  as conflicts often arise in innovation processes and  are  even  part  of  a  researcher's  everyday  life.  This  study  examined  innovation  and  the  variables  of  innovation  success  in  the  life  sciences;  it  tested  a  conflict management model and examined the impact  of both conflict type and conflict management style  on  innovation  performance.  
Ma8,  et  al.,  highlighted  that  the  globalization  has  led  to  increased  attention  to  cultural  diversity  in  workforces  and  its  influences  on  organizational  practice.  They  examined  group-oriented  values  and their impact on choice of conflict management  styles  as  well  as  on  conflict  resolution  outcomes  in  Turkey.  De  gregorio9,  et  al.,   highlighted  on  limited  understanding  about  the  antecedents  and  consequences  of  intraorganisational  conflict  within  advertising agencies. To remedy this, they surveyed  directors of account services and creative and media  departments in agencies across the US. Their findings  demonstrate that degree of centralisation, formalisation,  
internal  volatility,  and  psychological  distance  are  all positively related to level of destructive conflict,  whereas team spirit has an inverse relationship. They  also demonstrated that destructive and constructive  conflict  are  distinct  constructs  and  not  simply  opposing ends of a continuum. finally, it showed that  destructive and constructive conflict each influence  perceived quality of agency output. Roche & Paul10 gave  an  idea  in  the  theory  of  conflict  management  that  concerned  the  design  features  and  supposed  superior outcomes of conflict management systems  combining interest-based and rights-based practices  for  resolving  conflict  in  organisations. yet  much  of  the  literature  in  the  area  is  highly  prescriptive  and  draws  heavily  either  on  exemplary  case  studies  or  descriptive  data.  While  proactive  line  management  and  supervisory  engagement  in  conflict  resolution  as a key dimension of conflict management systems  is  found  to  be  positively  associated  with  a  range  of  organisational  outcomes,  no  evidence  is  found  for  the  kind  of  system  effects  proposed  in  the  theoretical  and  prescriptive  literature. 
Barki  &  Hartwick11   highlights  on  Researchers  from a wide range of management areas agree that  conflicts are an important part of organizational life  and that their study is important. yet, interpersonal  conflict  is  a  neglected  topic  in  information  system  development (ISD). Based on definitional properties  of interpersonal conflict identified in the management  and organizational behaviour literatures, this paper  tests a model of how individuals participating in ISD  projects perceive interpersonal conflict and examines  the  relationships  between  interpersonal  conflict,  management  of  the  conflict,  and  ISD  outcomes. 
Human resource play a vital task in the growth  process  of  contemporary  management  libraries.  Even  “there  are  great  difference  in  development  between  countries  which  seem  to  have  roughly  equal  resources,  so  it  is  necessary  to  enquire  into  the difference in human behaviour.” It is frequently  experienced  that  that,  through  the  exploitation  of  natural resources, availability of physical and financial  resources and global support play prominent roles in  the development of contemporary economies, none  of  these  issues  is  more  noteworthy  than  efficient  and  dedicated  manpower.  It  is  in  fact,  said  that  all  progress  comes  from  the  individual  brainpower.  So  there  is  a  urgent  need  to  know  the  conflict  management  in  management  college  libraries  and  to  resolve  the  same. 
3.    objeCtI ves

In  the  questionnaire  we  asked the respondents to answer our questions through  rating  method  like;  0  =  Nil,  1  =  Small  extent,  2  =  Moderate  extent,  3  =  Large  extent,  4  =  Maximum,  has  been  used  to  collect  data  from  respondents.  for the study, 30 libraries of Management colleges  that  are  spread  in  and  around  Bangalore  and  affiliated  to  Visvesvaraya  Technological  University  and Bangalore University of Karnataka region in India  were  chosen. forty  questionnaires  was  distributed  to  librarians  of  management  college,  30  (66.67%)  was  the  response  rate.  To  know  the  visibility  of  strategies,  NodeXL  software  (version  1.0.1.251)  was used. Mean is used to know the top strategies  used  in  conflict  management. 
5.   anaL ysIs 
An attempt has been made to report and summarise  the  research  data  collected  from  librarians  among  management  colleges  in  and  around  Bangalore,  pertaining  to  conflict  management.  
5.1  Conflict among  Library  Professionals 
Conflict  of  library  staffs  will  obstruct  the  vision  and  mission  of  the  Institute.  so  the  administrative  authorities  should  try  to  detect  the  conflict  among  
the  library  staff  in  initial  stage  itself,  otherwise  it  will  leads  to  distraction.  So  a  question  was  posed,  what  are  the  strategies  used  to  detect  the  conflict  among  library  staff?  Table  1  indicates  that,  50  %   of respondents, maximum professionals, inform their  conflict  through  dropping  a  letter  in  a  suggestion  box.  This  may  be  the  one  of  the  procedure  used  as  a  documentation  for  the  librarians  to  take  the  precautions to overcome conflict in future. While 13  librarians indicated that during the direct observation  of  the  conflict  between  the  staff  in  a  large  extent,  because the staff may do false allegations on their  colleagues. More than 17 % of professionals express  their  conflict  in  some  extent  trough  exit  interview  and grievance procedure. It will give console to the  respective staff that atleast my grievance is listned  by  our  authority,  and  sometimes  they  may  get  spot  solutions  also.  It  all  depends  on  the  mindset/  patience of the library professionals to express their  conflict  among  their  colleagues.  However,  these  conflict  should  not  hamper  the  routine  activities  and  scratch  the  name  of  institutes  where  staff  are  getting  their  bread  and  butter  for  them  and  their

5.2  strategies  used  to  resolve  Conflict 
It is quite natural and even we can find wide and  various conflict between two person, two group, two  religions, and others. So as a part of the objectives  we  solicit  the  information  that  what  are  various  strategies  you  are  following  to  resolve  the  conflict.  Table  2  shows  us,  60  %  (18)  of  the  respondents  accepts for some moderate extent they will allow on  medical ground like Medical/maternity/paternity leave,  as  normally  if  the  professionals  are  physically  and  mentally fit there will be less conflict, due to health  aspect  they  may  get  irritated  and  also  irritate  their  colleagues also. Below 14 (50 %) respondents told  for moderate extent they will allow their staff to Leave  travel allowance. The change work place and mood  may  refresh  professionals  from  the  hectic  routine  work. 13 (43.33 %) of the respondents allow home  town  allowance  to  a  large  extent.  Only  12  (40  %)

Questions  have  put  to  the  librarians  on  the  strategies used to overcome conflict situations. The  response  are  tabulated  in  the  Table  3,  it  indicates  53.33  %  of  the  respondents  (16)  negotiate  and  convince  to  a  maximum  extent  to  follow  take  and  give policy followed by 43.33 % counsel and motivate  to a small extent (13), who may be week and needs  motivation  to  avoid  the  conflicts  and  sort  out  the  problems  of  the  staff  from  time  to  time  to  a  small  extent (11). Lastly, 40 % of the respondents do not  offer  over  time  and  compensatory  holidays,  it  may  be to get the work done. As per respondents "Sort  out  the  problems  of  the  staff  from  time  to  time"  is  the  top  priority  used  to  overcome  the  conflicting  situations. 
respondents allot convenient shift to a some extent  and women staff are given flexible shifts to a large  extent.  "Women's  staff  are  given  flexible  shifts"  is  the  top  rank  strategies  used  to  resolve  the  conflict  among  the  library  professionals.

of subordinates 
Conflict  will  be  quite  common  when  there  is  a  team work, so managers should have strategies to  resolve the conflict among the staffs. A question was  posed  to  the  librarians  regarding  what  strategies  they  will  follow  when  there  is  a  conflict  between  the  staff.  8  options  given  were:  (a) Apply  win-lose  method,  (b)  Apply  lose-lose  method,  (c)  Apply  win-win  method,  (d)  Avoidance  style,  (e)  forcing  style, (f) Compromising style, (g) Collaborative style  and  (h)  others.  Table  4  reflects  that  16  (53.33  %)  respondents  use  Apply  win-win  method  to  provide  a  solution  which  is  acceptable  for  all  to  some  extent,  moderate  respondents  use,  apply  win-lose  method  (14  or  46.67  %)  as  in  a  routine  conflicts  one  has  lose  and  accept  is  fault  for  the  better  work environment, small extent use apply lose-lose
