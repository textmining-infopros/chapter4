 The paper aims to analyse authorship distribution in physics literature and to examine the validity  of Lotka’s law of scientifc publication productivity. A list of journal articles on various aspects of physics  research cited in the doctoral theses of University of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, South India was compiled  for the study. Using ‘straight count’ of authorship, a total of 1,665 personal authors were identifed and  3,367  authors  were  identifed  by  using  ‘complete  count’.  K-S  statistical  test  and  Chi-square  test  were  applied to verify the applicability of Lotka’s law in the two approaches. The productivity distribution did  not ft either set of data for two different author communities when Lotka’s law was applied in its original  form. This confrms that law does not applicable to authors of the physics literature.

1. INtRODUctION 
Classifying and counting scientists, books, papers  and  citation,  as  early  statistical  bibliographers  set  out  to  do,  remain  a  fairly  extemporary  activity  as  long  as  data  continued  to  be  examined  outside  a  mathematical framework that would let them disclose  meaningful  patterns  in  the  documentation  process.  The turning point occurred between the 1920s and  the  1930s,  when  three  basic  bibliometric  studies  were  published:  Lotka’  work  on  the  distribution  of  scientific  papers  among  authors;  Bradford’s  contribution on the scattering of papers on a given  subject  in  scientific  journals;  and  Zipf’s  work  on  the distribution of words in a text1. Lotka, Bradford  and Zipf used simple mathematical statements and  graphical  devices  to  express  the  empirical  relation  between  sources  and  the  items  they  produce  in  three  areas:  Authors  producing  papers,  journals  producing  papers  on  a  given  subject,  and  texts  producing  words  with  a  given  frequency. 
Three  regularities  occur  in  bibliometrics  to  which  have  been  given  the  name  ‘law’:  Lotka’s  Law of Scientific Productivity (authors publishing in  a  certain  discipline),  Bradford’s  Law  of  Scattering  (distribution of publications), and Zipf’s law of Word  
The  validity  of  Lotka’s  law  has  been  studied  by  a  number  of  researchers  who  have  applied  the  model  to  data  sets  in  many  subject  areas.  Most  notable  are  the  contribution  of  Pao3   and  Nicholls4,  who  found  that  the  Lotka  model  fitted  the  majority  of  the  data  sets  studied.  Both  have  substantially confirmed the validity of the law, having  tested  it,  respectively,  against  48  and  70  datasets  of  empirical  author  productivity  distributions.  The  authors felt necessary to establish a standard testing  procedure  for  meaningful  statistical  comparison  between  different  tests  of  Lotka’s  law  by  defining  the minimal requirements for each step involved in  any  validation  process.  They  are:  
(a)  Specification  of  the  model  
(b)  Data  collection  
(c)  Estimation  of  the  unknown  parameters  in  the  
model  equation,  and  
(d)  Testing  conformity  of  the  observed  data  to  the  
theoretical distribution by means of a goodness- 
of–fit  test.

where,  p   is  the  number  of  authors  producing  n papers,  and  where  k   is  constant  characteristic  of  a  particular  subject  area. 
Lotka gave an acceptably modern mathematical  description  of  his  regularity  that  remains  today  as  the  (classic)  Lotka’s  law.  However,  Lotka’s  article  was  not  cited  until  1941  and  his  distribution  was  not  termed  ‘Lotka’s  Law’  until  1949,  as  said  by  Potter6. 
Bookstein7  points out that the following theoretical  model

is  a  generalised  version  of  Lotka’s  law;  k  and  a  are  constants.  In  other  words,  the  number  of  authors  with  x  papers  is  proportional  to

There  are  two  approaches  generally  used  for  organising  scientific  productivity  data:  
(i)  Size-frequency: A standard frequency approach  
which  models  frequency  of  source  f(x)  as  a  
function  of  the  number  of  items  x.  It  allows  
one  to  use  traditional  statistical  techniques. (ii) Rank-frequency: An approach which models the  
number of items g(x) as a function of the rank  
of  the  source r.  It  emphasis  on  those  sources  
which  have  the  most  productive  items,  than  
those  having  small  ranks r   =  1,2,3,4… 
3. LItERAtURE  REVIEW 
Lotka’s  work  went  unnoticed  for  many  years.  In  1978,  a  bibliography  of  437  works  on  Lotk’s  Law  and  related  statistical  regularities  appeared  in  the first issue of the journal Scientometrics10.  Ever  since, the convergence of productivity patterns with  
Law of Scientific Productivity states that, N½  sources  yield  a  fraction  ½  of  the  items. 
In most of these studies, the number of publications  are considered as a measure of scientific productivity.  There  are  four  methods  of  counting  of  number  of  publications9. 
(1) Total counting/normal (standard) counting: Each  
occurrence  of  an  author  is  recognised  and  
by  the  square  root  of  the  total  number  of  scientific  
Lotka’s  formula  has  been  advocated  in  as  diverse  authors.  In  other  words,  the  Price’s  Square  Root  
areas of LIS, computer science, semiconductor and  
micro  computer  research,  medicine,  biochemistry,  
number  of  authors  associated  with  a  given  
entomology, econometrics, patent literature and web  hyperlink  distribution11. 
The  degree  of  conformity  or  non-conformity  of  various empirical distributions of Lotka’s distribution  has  been  tested  by  many  authors.  The  studies  on  the  fitness  of  Lotka’s  law  began  in  a  systematic  manner was with the work of Pao using least square  
credit,  whether  he  or  she  is  the  only  author  
of  a  publication  or  one  of  many  (each  of  the  
N   authors  receives  a  credit  of  1) 
(2) Straight counting/ first author counting: Only the  
first author is counted, based on the assumption  
that  the  first  author  is  the  primary  contributor  
receives  equal  treatment,  regardless  of  the  
method  with  48  sets  of  authors  productivity  data.  
In  1985,  Pao12   presented  the  application  process  article.  Therefore,  an  author  receives  equal  
of  Lotka’s  law  and  again  in  1986  she  studies  it  
in  other  scientific  fields.  Modifications  to  Pao’s  
procedure  were  proposed  by  Nicholls13,14. 
The other studies include: Lemoline15  analysed  scientific  productivity  of  CSIR,  India;  Sen,  Taib  &  Hassan16   in  Information  science,  Gupta 
17 
  in  potato  research; Gupta & Kumar18  in theoretical population  genetics;  Kawamura19,  et  al.  in  dental  science  
to  a  publication.  In  deriving  Inverse  Square  literature; Gupta20,  et al.studied productivity profile of  
Law  of  Scientific  Productivity,  Lotka  adopted  
this  method  (only  the  first  of  the  N   authors  
receives  a  credit  1) 
(3) Adjusted  counting/Fractional  counting:  Authors  
scientists in engineering sciences; LOTKA, a computer  program  for  fitting  Lotka’s  law  was  presented  by  Rousseau & Rousseau21, and Kumar22   in  computer  science; Pulgarin & Gil-Leiva23  in automatic indexing  
multiple authors (each of the N  author receives  
1 
a  score  of  
N 
). 
(4) Proportional  counting:  If  an  author  has  a  rank  
R  in a paper with  N  authors ( R=1,2,3…N), then  
receive  fractional  credit  or  publications  with  
literature.  Rai  &  Kumar24   examined  Lotka’s  law  
among authors and within institutions with the help

of  empirical  data.

Sudhier33   conducted  a  study  on  the  application  of  Lotka’s  law  of  scientific  productivity  in  the  author  productivity distribution of Physics literature appended  in  the  IISc  doctoral  theses.  
Lotka’s law has been attracted scientometricians  time  and  again.  There  have  been  many  studies,  which  have  explored  the  application  of  Lotka’s  
5.1 Application  of  Lotka’s  Law 
Lotka was the first to observe and analyse the  productivity  patterns  of  authors  in  a  sample  data  from  Chemistry  and  Physics.  He  came  out  with  a  general  formula,  known  as  Lotka’s  law  and  it  can  be  written  as  
xny = k (1) 
where,  y  is  the  frequency  of  authors  making  n  contributions  each  and  k  is  a  constant. 
The Lotka’s inverse square law can mathematically  be  written  as 
g(x) = ( 
6p 
)( 
1 
x 
2 ),   x 
  =  1,  2,  3  …. (2) 
law  to  various  subject  areas.  The  review  revealed  
where, g(x) is the proportion of authors making  x 
that  there  were  not  many  studies  in  the  area  of  physics literature. Hence, this paper attempts study  the  validity  of  application  of  Lotka’s  law  in  author  productivity  distribution  of  Physics  literature. 
4. ObJEctIVEs 
This  paper  has  following  objectives: 
(a) To  analyse  the  author  productivity  patterns  in  
the  field  of  physics  literature 
(b) To examine the validity of Lotka’s law using total  
counting  and  straight  counting  of  authors (c) To apply Chi-square test and Kolmolgorov- Smirnov  
contributions. 
A generalised form of Lotka’s law was presented  by  Bookstein2   as 
g(x)  =kx-n, x   =  1,2,3,4… xmax, k>0 (3) where g(x) represents the fraction of authors publishing  x  articles;  k  and  n   are  parameters  to  be  estimated  from  the  data;  xmax   represents  the  maximum  size  or value of productivity variable x; and n  is usually  ≥1. 
According to Pao, the following procedure should  be  followed  in  studying  the  application  of  fit  of  the  
Lotka’s  law.

The  first  step  in  the  application  of    Lotka’s  law  is  to  determine  the  value  of n,  which  is  to  be  determined either by using the Linear Least Square  
in  the  doctoral  theses  of  the  University  of  Kerala,  (LLS)  regression  method  or  one  of  it’s  equivalent  India. The total sample consists of 1,665 first authors  form  given  by  the  following  formula:

The  University  of  Kerala,  which  occupies  the  position  of  the  mother  university  in  Kerala,  has  been at the centre of all higher education activities  in  state  since  its  very  inception.  Popularly  known  as  ‘God’s  own  country’,  the  tiny  state  is  located  in  the  south  western  part  of  peninsular  India.  The  University  of  Travancore  which  eventually  became  the University of Kerala was established in 1937. It  is being the oldest university in the Kerala pioneered  in undertaking science programmes directly affecting  the state. At present, the University has 16 faculties  and 41 departments of teaching and research. The

here, p is assumed to be 20 and n  is the experimentally  computed value of the exponent from the observed  distribution. 
Once the value of n  and  k   is  determined,  then  using  eqn.  3,  determine  the  number  of  authors  writing  1,  2,  3,…x   articles 
5.2  Goodness-of-Fit  tests 
There are several statistics available for goodness- of-fit  tests. Among  those  tests,  the  Chi-square  test  and  Kolmogrov-Smirnov  (K-S)  test  commonly  used  as  goodness-of-fit  tool. 
(a)  Chi-square  Test 
If the observations in a sample fall into certain  specified categories or classes it may be of interest  to  know  whether  the  observed  frequencies  differ  significantly from those which could be expected in  these categories on the basis of certain hypotheses  or theoretical considerations. The c2-  test  is  useful  in  finding  out  where  a  theoretical  distribution  like  Lotka’s Law or any other, fits the given observations  satisfactorily  or  not. 
g (b)  K-S  Test 
The test is accomplished by finding the theoretical  cumulative  frequency  distribution  which  would  be  expected under the null hypothesis [F(x)] and comparing  it with the observed cumulative frequency distribution  [Sn(x)].  The  point  at  which  these  two  distribution,  theoretical and observed show the maximum deviation  
By  substituting  the  values  in  equation  (4),  the  
value  of  n  is  calculated  as

(b)  Calculation  of  value  ‘k’ 
The  value  of  parameter  n   is  calculated  as,  n  
=  -2.3270 
Substituting  the  given  value  of  n,  the

(a)  Calculation  of  parameter  ‘n’ 
The  first  step  in  the  application  of  Lotka’s  law  is  to  determine  the  value  of n,  which  is  to  be  determined  by  Linear  Least  Square  (LLS)  method  by  using  the  mathematical  formula  (4). 
To compute the parameter n,  Table 1 of  x   and  g(x)  is  used.

(i)  Suitability  of  Lotka’s  Law  using  K-S  Statistical  
   Test 
To  test  the  applicability  of  Lotka’s  law,  Coile36 recommends  the  K-S  statistical  test. 
For  applying  K-S  test,  convert  the  observed  and  expected  number  of  authors  into  fractional  values, and take the difference between cumulative

fractional values of observed and expected number  of  authors,  as  shown  in  Table  2. 
The maximum difference value, Dmax, representing  the  maximum  deviation  is  identified  as  0.023. 
The  table  value  or  critical  value  of  D   in  K-S  test  at  5  %  level  of  significance  is  0.565.  While  comparing the actual value of D, 0.023 with critical  value  0.565,  it  is  found  that  the  actual  value  of D does not fall within the critical value of D. Therefore,  
K-S  statistical  test  and  Chi-square  test  are  applied  to  verify  the  applicability  of  Lotka’s  law  at  5 %  level of significance to the author productivity  distribution of first authors of physics literature and  it is found that the law does not fit the present set  of  data  in  the  two  methods.

(b)  Calculation  of  the  Value  ‘k’ 
The  value  of  k  is  determined  by  taking  the  corresponding  value   n  =  -2.41  from  the  table  of  exponents  given  by  Rousseau  (1993)  as  the  value  of  k  is  0.73. 
By  replacing  the  value  of  n  and  k  in  Lotka’s  equation g(x)  = kx-n 
The  fractional  value  of  expected  number  of  authors  are  calculated,  and  the  values  are  shown  in  column  6  of  the  Table  5. 
(i) Application  of  K-S  Statistical  Test 
For applying the K-S statistical test, results are  tabulated  in  Table  5. 
The difference between the cumulative fractional  values  of  the  observed  and  the  expected  number  of  authors  are  shown  in  column  7  of  the  Table  5.  The  maximum  deviation  is  identified  as  0.058.  The  critical  value  of  D   in  K-S  test  at  5  %  level

of  significance  is  0.391.  Here,  the  actual  value  of  D,  0.058  does  not  fall  within  the  critical  value  of  D,  0.391.  Therefore,  the  test  confirming  that  the  distribution  of  the  data  using  whole  author  count  doesn’t  fit  Lotka’s  law. 
(ii)  Using  Chi-square  Test 
To check whether the author productivity distribution  follows the Lotka’s alw or not, the Chi- square test  is  applied  to  the  data.  The  results  of  the  analysis  are  tabulated  in  Table  6. 
The  calculated  value  of  chi-square  obtained  is  95.10 and the critical value at 5% level of significance  is 4.4. On comparing, it is found that the calculated  value of Chi-square is greater than the critical value  of  chi-square.  Thus,  again  it  is  conclude  that  the  Lotka’s  law  does  not  fit  in  the  observed  given  all  author  productivity  distribution. 
The  statistical  tests  show  that  the  Lotka’s  law  in  its  generalised  form  does  not  fit  the  author  productivity distribution pattern prepared for the first  authors  and  for  the  contribution  of  all  authors.

7.   c ONcLUsIONs 
Lotka’s  law  of  author  productivity  is  regarded  as  one  of  the  classical  laws  of  bibliometric.  The  present  study  showed  that  Lotka’  generalised  law  is  not  applicable  to  physics  literature.  
K-S  test  and  chi-square  test  are  applied  to  verify  the  applicability  of  Lotka’s  law  of  scientific  productivity. The statistical tests show that the Lotka’s  law  in  its  generalised  form  does  not  fit  the  author  productivity  distribution  pattern  prepared  for  the  straight  count  and  for  the  contribution  of  complete  count  of  the  University  of  Kerala  theses  citations. 
This  is  a  preliminary  study  on  authorship  productivity  in  the  field  of  physics  research  and  this  study  may  trigger  more  such  studies  for  the  purpose of testing Lotka’s law in the various branches  of  physics.  Future  research  could  be  directed  to  authorship and productivity studies in physics based  on various institutions in the country and contributions  from  different  databases.
