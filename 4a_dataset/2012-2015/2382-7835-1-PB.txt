ABSTRACT
The paper presents an analysis of design and structure of the library websites of IITs. It found significant
differences according to some important point of view such as the user supporting services, number of hyperlinks
on home pages and whole websites, number of images, location of images, In-active links and web pages, etc.
The paper finally looks the design and structure of the library websites of IITs.
Keywords: Webpage, website, webometrics, IIT library, web analysis, link analysis

1. INTRODUCTION
The world wide web has now become one of the main
sources of information to academic and research activities,
and therefore, is an excellent platform to test new method of
evaluating webometrics. The IIT libraries are developing from
several years. In the last several years, many research
studies have focused on how people use electronic
resources or on their feelings about electronic resources in
the library. The IIT libraries have embraced the internet fairly
but still struggling to overcome internet-related challenges
such as the construction and development of IIT library
websites, subscription to online resources (journals,
database, e-books, etc).

2. NEED OF STUDY
The study was conducted to know and determine:
•

About the website of IIT libraries

•

Web structure of IIT libraries

•

Length of IIT libraries websites

•

About tabulation work on websites of IIT libraries

•

Retrieval service on the IIT libraries websites

•

Location and number of images

•

E-resource service through the IIT libraries websites

3. OBJECTIVE OF STUDY
•

To calculate the number of web pages, number of
links, number of self links pages and external links
pages of IIT libraries

•

To compare various IIT libraries websites to determine
which is the best

•

To analyse the services of IIT libraries websites

•

To analyse graphical presentation of IIT libraries
websites

4. HYPOTHESIS
•

Website of IIT libraries may be more useful for research
scholars, students, and faculty members of IITs

•

Study may be very useful for the students of library
and information science to same types of research

5. METHODOLOGY
The study is totally observational in which the
structure, design, size, graphical presentation, library
services and products of the websites of IIT libraries were
observed. The primary data was collected from the
websites of IIT libraries then input the primary data
according to different point of view in the MS-excel sheet
then created the tables and graphs that are presenting the
finding of study. The secondary data collected was from
books, journals, internet, conference proceedings, and
other sources.

6. SCOPE AND LIMITATION
The present study covered all the websites of IIT
libraries in India. The following library websites are
included:

7. LITERATURE REVIEW
Ratha, Naidu, and Silawat1 investigated the structure
of the national library websites of SAARC countries.
Arakaki and Willett2 reports an analysis of the websites of
UK Departments of Library and Information Science. A
webometric study of the websites of 45 universities in
Tamil Nadu comprising of 27 state and 18 private
universities was done. Elgohary4 investigated the web
impact factor of Arab universities. Walia and Kaur5
reported the results of a webometrics investigation done
on the website of selected library association website of
India.

The subject ‘webometrics study of IIT libraries
websites in India’ has been chosen and analysis has
been done with 15 IIT libraries websites. Data has been
collected about the different aspects and analysed:

8.1 Total Links of Library Websites of IITs
Table 1 shows the total links of IIT library websites of
India. The library website of IIT Delhi led with total links
4070 (935.19 %), followed by library websites of IIT
Guwahati 2605 (22.59 %), IIT Bombay 2597 (22.52 %), IIT
Madras 205 (10.45 %) and IIT Khargpur 205 (1.77 %).

It is necessary to find out which IIT library provides the
information service through its website like audio/video, eresources, and blogs services as these services are very
useful for the users. Four essential services of IITs were
compared (Table 8):

of total doc files are 69 each library website.

8.7 Analysis of User Supporting Services
It is necessary to find out whether the user supporting
service like web OPAC, search bar, site map and inter
library loan facility are available or not on the library
websites of IIT. It is found that the web OPAC is available
only in the 4 (26.67 %) websites followed by the search
bar available in 5 (33.33 %), the site map available in 9 (60
%) and inter library loan facility available in 3 (20 %)
websites (Table 7). Thus, there are only three library
websites (Bombay, Madras and Delhi) which provide all
the above mentioned user supporting services.

IITs

user supporting services like Web OPAC, search bar,
site map and inter library loan.

Table 10 describes the total number of images on the
websites in which library website of IIT Kharagpur is on
the top with 50 (43.47 %) images, followed by IIT Madras
22 (19.13 %), IIT Bombay 18 (15.64 %), IIT Delhi 12 (10.43
%), and IIT Roorkee 6 (5.21 %).

•

The library websites of IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi are
also available in Hindi language.

•

Most of the libraries don’t update their websites only
the IIT Madras, IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay library
websites are updating continuously.

μ = Mean, n = IIT library,X=Images, μ = 115/15, μ = 7.67

•

There are 115 total images on IIT libraries websites
and the mean of total images is 8 for each IIT library
website.

Some of the library websites expose the descriptive
Information about their collection, infrastructure,
system and services.

•

Some of the libraries websites are also providing the
information services. Library websites of IIT Bombay
and IIT Delhi provide the audio/visual, e-resource, and
digital library services.

10. SUGGESTIONS
•

IIT library authority should appoint a separate team for
creating, designing and updating the websites.

•

Rajasthan IIT library should create separate
webpages or websites.

•

Large amount of the text on the single webpage does
work properly because it makes difficult for users to
extract useful information. So web developer should
not keep too much information on the single webpage.

•

All the IIT libraries websites should include the user
supporting facilities like web OPAC and search bar.

•

All IIT library websites should provide e-resources
services.

•

All IIT libraries websites should share online
resources through the ILL services to their students,
researchers and faculty members.

•

All the IITs libraries should use the same standard to
the information retrieval.

•

Layout, colour, and structure of each library websites
should be simple and attractive.

•

Library websites of IITs should be provided the Library
2.0 services like the chat referencing, instant
massaging, social networking sites, etc., to
communicate the information in full duplex mode.

9. FINDINGS
Based on the collected data and its analysis the
following are the findings of the present study:
•

•

The IIT Delhi has the highest number of total links
among all the IITs library websites. The IIT Delhi has
4070 (35.29 %) total links in which the 3709 (38.28 %)
links are also included that are not created by the IIT
Delhi it’s only connected with the library website of IIT
Delhi.
The library websites of IIT Bombay is at the top most
with 75(28.84 %) never active links (those are not able
to perform) but it is also traced out that the library
website of IIT Bombay more informative because it
has 468 (35.64 %) total webpages.

•

It is also traced that the highest numbers of pdf files are
connected with the library website of IIT Gandhinagar.

•

Some of the library websites are also providing library
services through their websites. The library websites
of IIT Bombay, IIT Madras and IIT Delhi provide the

11. CONCLUSIONS
The study has been exploratory. Links analysis of the
websites of the IIT libraries in India is an unexplored area
of webometrics research. This study gives a fair idea
about the information provided by the 15 IITs library web
sites of the India. These finding open the door to the future
studies of new area of the web. If the web masters of IITs
library websites follow the above suggestions so they can
improve the web facilities.
