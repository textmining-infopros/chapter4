 Impact of library holdings in terms of physical access of doctoral studies in six general universities  of  Karnataka  (Bangalore  University,  University  of  Mysore,  Mangalore  University,  Karnatak  University,  Gulbarga University and Kuvempu University) have been studied based on citation appended to the PhD  dissertations in engineering and technology. It’s evident that some materials in libraries become outdated  as  time  progresses. This  can  be  referred  to  as  ‘obsolescence’.  Obsolescence  studies  are  one  of  the  foremost areas of citations, bibliometrics, scientometrics, and infometrics. Citation analysis has usually  been  generally  study  the  obsolescence  of  materials,  the  existence  of  a  core  of  heavily  used  sources,  and so the sort of the foremost used materials. The problem most often studied in this fashion is that the  obsolescence rate of the literature in many subjects of engineering. The study was done to grasp regarding  the obsolescence of engineering literature cited in 137 doctoral dissertations of engineering and technology  awarded during 1961 to 2008. The study reveals that, the overall of 7467 citations of periodical articles  and 2014 book citations are scattered primarily among ffteen subjects. However, citations were derived  from early 1990 to after 2001, 86 % of books cited by engineers and technologists in their PhD theses  were of 9-39 years recent associated an outsized share of the journal citations (68.58 %) utilised by the  researchers was published 20 years back or weres older than the recent ones. It together shows that extra  journals literature cited during 1971-2000 equally in books literature cited at intervals of 1961-1990.

1. INtrODUCtION 
The  scientific  discoveries  and  inventions  are  of  importance  to  mankind,  if  consumers  are  ready  to  utilise  the  obtainable  information  effectively  and  significantly.  It  is  so  necessary  that  information  is  created obtainable for effective utilisation at any levels,  so as to profit the society. In view of the information  explosion and it results in quantitative and qualitative  studies of literature (often branded as bibliometrics,  informetrics librametrics and scientometrics) to review  and perceive the phenomena of literature, i.e., growth,  impact, obsolescence, collaboration etc are typically  known as measuring tools. Though technology has  given  many  new  gadgets,  it  becomes  mandatory  on  the  part  of  the  professionals  to  grasp  as  what  to  accumulate  and  the  way  to  produce  the  needed  information  to  the  users  particularly  in  engineering  field  with  least  price  and  at  a  faster  rate1.  
The use of information of a specific discipline or  a  document  reaches  a  most  when  an  exact  period  of  your  time  right  from  its  date  of  publication,  and  thenceforth,  its  use  gradually  declines.  This  sort  of  relationship  is  usually  expressed  by  the  term  'obsolescence'. Some documents, on the other hand,  continue to see high levels of recognition long when  their publication and they become ‘Citation Classics’2.  Obsolescence  of  literature  helps  the  librarians  to  keep  up  the  need-based  collection  of  literature.  There are many obsolescence studies accessible in  the literature as well as several studies have been  revealed in Indian journals on doctoral dissertations.  However, there are not any studies carried out so far  on  obsolescence  analysis  of  doctoral  dissertations  in  engineering  and  technology  awarded  by  the  six  universities of Karnataka. Thus an attempt has made  to  understand  the  journal  and  books  obsolescence

2.    r EVIEW  OF  rELAtED  StUDIES 
Citation analysis (reference counting) has generally  been  used  to  study  the  obsolescence  of  materials.  Vimala  &  Reddy3   examined  the  obsolescence  of  literature  in  Zoology  by  citation  analysis  of  128  doctoral  theses  in  Zoology.  Study  reveals  that  the  citation  frequency  follows  a  negative  exponential  pattern.  Half-life  of  literature  is  found  to  be  13  years for journal citations and 13.27 years for book  citations.  Another  study  carried  out  by  Biradar  &  Kumar4   examined  the  obsolescence  of  literature,  annual aging factor, and mean life and utility factor of  periodicals in the field of Chemistry. This study based  on  references  appended  to  the  articles  published  in  Indian  Journal  of  Chemical  Technology   during  the  year  1994,  1997  and  1999.  Obsolescence  of  literature was studied and half-life of literature was  found to be 11.8 years. Study also applied Brooke's  formula  for  identifying  annual  aging  factor  and  the  average  value  was  found  to  be  0.9754  and  mean  life  and  utility  factor  were  calculated  and  found  to  be  16.1958  and  40.65  respectively.  The  growth  of  literature and their obsolescence are usually treated  together,  because  they  represent  the  initial  and  finial  stages  of  the  information  cycle.  
Whereas Tonta & Umut5  analysed the bibliometric  features of 100 theses and dissertations completed  at  the  Department  of  Librarianship  of  Hacettepe  University  between  1974  and  2002.  No  correlation  was  found  between  the  frequency  of  citations  of  the  most  frequently  cited  journals  and  their  impact  factors. Pillai6  attempted to examine the obsolescence  of  literature  in  Physics  by  citation  analysis  and  reviewed  various  studies  already  done  in  the  field  and outlined the results. Gunjal & Sangam7  examined  the obsolescence of literature and aforesaid factors  in  the  field  of  Chemistry  based  on  references  appended  to  the  articles  published  in  selected  Chemistry  periodicals  and  doctoral  theses  during  1975–1995.  Study  reveals  that  the  obsolescence  factors  such  as  annual  ageing,  half-life,  mean-life,  utility  factor  for  the  doctoral  theses  and  the  cited  journal articles varies from one branch to another in  chemistry. Hence these findings have implications in  the  formulation  of  policies  relating  to  the  planning  and organisation and weeding of materials, binding of  books and journals, retrospective searching of literature  in  libraries.  Hui8   carried  out  study  on  information  aging  into  three  parts:  document  and  information  aging, knowledge aging and web information aging,  and  given  each  part  a  specific  discussion  so  as  to  show  the  state  of  information  aging  study  in  their  country.  So  far  no  study  has  been  carried  out  on  the  six  universities  of  Karnataka,  and  this  was  the  rationale of this study and accordingly the following  scope  and  objectives  have  been  lined  up.

3.  SCOPE  OF  tHE  St UDY 
The  present  study  attempts  to  discover  the  obsolescence  rate  of  engineering  literature  cited  within  the  scholarly  persons’  theses  awarded  in  six  universities  specifically  Bangalore  University,  University of Mysore, Mangalore University, Karnatak  University,  Gulbarga  University  and  Kuvempu  University,  all  above  six  universities  are  located  in  several  geographical  locations  of  Karnataka  state.  Further,  this  study  focuses  on  the  citations  included in scholarly person’s theses awarded in ten  disciplines of engineering and technology has been  covered  for  the  study  and  elite  through  systematic  sampling methodology. Category wise distribution of  the cited items viz. journals, books & monographs,  conference  proceedings  citations  and  others  have  been studied. Category wise percentile distribution and  availableness  of  cited  items  have  been  calculated.  However,  this  study  limits  to  journals  and  books  obsolescence study, further suggestive approach to  re-engineering of assortment development policy of  the  university  libraries  have  been  lined  up  based  on  the  findings. 
4.  ObJECtIVES 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to:  
(a) Study  the  distribution  of  PhD  theses (b) Take  a  look  at  the  exponentiality  of  citation  
frequency  
(c) Study  the  chronological  distribution  of  journal  
and  book  citations,  and 
(d) Confirm obsolescence and half-life of engineering  
journal  and  book  citations. 
5.  MEtHODOLOGY 
This article relies on part of the scholar studies  at University of Mysore, Mysore. The study confined  to  the  branches  of  engineering  and  technology.  Nearly  275  theses  were  submitted  to  these  six  universities  throughout  the  period  of  1961-2008.  An  attempt  has  been  created  to  collect  as  many  as  theses  from  the  six  universities  for  this  study.  The data for the study has been obtained from 137  theses  in  the  field  of  engineering  and  technology  submitted  by  the  research  students.  With  this  data  in  hand,  there  are  7467  citations  of  periodical  articles  and  2014  citations  of  books  are  scattered  primarily among fifteen subjects. The details of the  citations  appended  in  each  thesis  is  recorded  by  exploitation  computers  with  the  assistance  of  pre- designed surpass sheet. Some renowned statistical  and bibliometric guidelines are applied for the study.  The structure of the topic, its growth, distribution of  documents,  etc.,  has  been  examined  in  line  of  the  objectives  of  the  study.  Finally,  data  interpretation  and  findings  were  recorded  with  conclusion.

Table  1  reveals  that,  out  of  137  PhD  theses  collected  for  the  study,  a  majority  63  (45.98  %)  were  from  Bangalore  University,  30  (21.89  %)  from  University  of  Mysore,  20  (14.59  %)  from  Mangalore  University,  12  (8.75  %)  from  Karnatak  University, 7 (5.10%) from Gulbarga University , and  5  (3.65  %)  from  Kuvempu  University.  It  can  even  be  determined  that  more  than  67  %  of  the  theses  were  from  Bangalore  University  and  University  of  Mysore.  Since  Bangalore  University  is  oldest  University and it has University Visvesvaraya College  of  Engineering  as  its  constituent  college,  several  research registrations were done and degrees were  awarded. Gulbarga and Kuvempu Universities being  relatively  new  universities,  less  number  of  PhDs  were  awarded  in  Engineering  and Technology.  It  is  also  determined  that  although  Karnatak  University  is older than Mangalore University, it has produced  only  12  PhDs. 
6.2  Discipline-wise  Distribution  of  PhD theses 
The details of the discipline-wise distribution of  PhD theses data has been collected and analysed.  It  reveals  that  53  (38.7  %)  theses  were  in  Civil  Engineering, 38 (27.74 %) in Mechanical Engineering,  19  (13.87  %)  in  Electrical  Engineering,  7  (5.1  %)  each in Computer Science and Applied Electronics,  5  (3.64  %)  in  Chemical  Engineering,  4  (2.92  %)  in  Electronics,  2  (1.45  %)  in  Aerospace  Engineering,  and remaning each one in Biotechnology and Mining  with  0.73  %.  
6.3  Subject-wise  Citation  of  Journal  Articles  
and books 
The subject wise distribution of journal articles  and  books  cited  in  theses  reveals  that  majority  of  
citations  belong  to  five  major  subjects  i.e.,  Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and  Electronics Engineering, Computer Science Engineering  and  Electronics  &  Communication  Engineering.  The  subject  wise  distribution  of  journals  articles  and  books  cited  in  engineering  &  technology  PhD  theses  were  presented  in  Table  2.

variety  journal  citations  severally  27.03  %  are  on  Civil Engineering, followed by citations on Electrical  Engineering (23.06 %), Mechanical Engineering (18.8  %), Electronics (11.37 %) and Computer Science &  Engineering (8.62 %). Whereas compared to books  citations  24.92  %  were  on  Mechanical  Engineering  followed  by  Civil  Engineering  (22.69  %)  citations,  Computer Science & Engineering (20.95 %), Electronics  and  Communication  Engineering  (8.69  %)  and  Electrical Engineering (8.54 %). Citations on Mining/ Earth  Science/Geology,  Physics,  Biotechnology,  Chemical  Engineering  and  Chemistry,  Aerospace,  Management,  Medicine,  Biomedical  Engineering,  and Bioscience were small in variety and that they  all  together  represent  14.21  %  of  total  number  of  books  citations  compared  to  10.15  %  of  journals  citations.  Since  mechanical  and  civil  disciplines  are  really  oldest  disciplines  among  the  alternative  disciplines  this  could  be  the  reason  for  plenty  of  productivity has been seen at intervals the engineering  analysis  literature. 
6.4  Chronological  Distribution  of  Journal  and  
book  Citations 
The  chronological  distributions  of  journal  and  book  citations  are  given  in  Table  3.  The  citations  from  the  journals  and  books  are  divided  into  12  periods  having  periodicity  of  ten  year  each.  The  citations before 1990 are enclosed within the cluster  up to 1900 and also the journal and book citations  are  after  2001  enclosed  2001+  groups. 
It is evident from Table 3 that, the engineers and  technologists  of  the  University  of  Karnataka  prefer  most of the citations of 1981-1990 (26.77 %), 1991- 2000  (23.72  %)  and  1971-1980  (20.72  %)  periods.  It  shows  that  the  literature  cited  by  engineers  and  technologists  in  their  PhD  theses  cite 71.21  %  of

journals  that  are  within  the  period  of  1971-2000.  Relatively  it  conjointly  discovered  from  the  table  3  that  almost  70  percent  of  the  books  cited  by  the  scholars were from 1961 to 1900. Books concerning  precedent days are least cited and up-to-date books  also  are  less  cited.  
As  time  goes  on,  the  information  content  of  the  journals  and  books  that  were  once  relevant  and  of  universal  application,  becomes  obsolete.  The  thought  content  of  the  journals  and  books  of  old  editions  has  been  well-tried  to  be  either  wrong  or  change  of  approach  to  several  scientific  and  technical  issues.  The  reasons  for  changes  within  the  use  of  literature  content  could  also  be  invalid  or  valid  however  incorporated  in  later  work  or  outdated  by  later  work. 
6.5  Frequency  of  Journal  and  book  Citations  
and  their  Obsolescence 
Obsolescence and age studies of literature are  quite common in citation analysis and it involves the  decline in use of documents or citation received by  documents over a period of time. Table 4 represents  the obsolescence of journals and books cited within  the engineering and technology doctoral dissertations.  A complete of 7467 journal and 2014 book citations  were classified into 11 time zones, each having the  time  length  of  10  years.

Table 4 reveals that, the engineers and technologists  of the universities of Karnataka cite a lot of journals  with  time  span  of  10-19  years  (28.85  %)  equally  a  lot  of  books  cited  (26.21  %),  followed  by  20-29  years  24.63  %  of  books  against  of  22.37  %  of  journals  citations.  Whereas,  during  30-39  years  17.36  %  of  journals  and  18.31  %  of  books  in  0-9  years. That is, an oversized proportion of the journal  citations  (68.58  %)  employed  by  the  researchers  were  published  twenty  years  back  or  were  older  than  the  recent  ones. The  researchers’  mostly  cite

recent  journals  in  their  PhD  theses.  The  analysis  shows  that  there  were  lots  of  probabilities  for  a  book  to  induce  citations  that  was  published  in  the  last  20-29  years.  The  results  conjointly  indicate  that  the  engineers  and  technologists  prefer  to  cite  current/recent  books  in  their  theses.  
The half-life period of journals and books cited  by  the  research  students  were  calculated  (median  year)  as  59  years  and  therefore  the  mean  year  of  journal  and  book  citations  are  49.45. 
7.  FINDINGS  AND  CONCLUSIONS 
Obsolescence  studies  are  one  of  the  main  
4. 
areas of citations, bibliometrics, scientometrics and  infometrics.  Citation  analysis  (reference  counting)  
has  typically  been  used  to  study  the  obsolescence  
5. 
of  materials,  the  existence  of  a  core  of  heavily  used  sources,  and  also  the  style  of  the  foremost  used  materials.  The  issue  most  frequently  studied  
in  this  manner  is  to  knoe  the  obsolescence  rate  of  
6. 
the  literature  in  several  disciplines  of  information.  Obsolescence  and  age  studies  of  literature  are  quite  common  in  citation  analysis  and  it  involves  
the decline in use of documents or citation received  
7. 
by  documents  over  a  period  of  time.  It  has  been  a  priority  for  librarians  these  days  owing  to  the  increasing  costs  similarly  as  increasing  range  of  resource (print and on-line journals and books). The  studies of the obsolescence of literature facilitate the  
to  decide  that,  which  document  is  to  be  too  kept  and which is to be discarded, so as to keep up the  need-based  assortment  within  the  libraries.  More  the  study  reveals  that,  71.6  %  of  total  citations  relate  to  37  years  old  publications.  This  proves  
active library professionals and knowledge scientists
