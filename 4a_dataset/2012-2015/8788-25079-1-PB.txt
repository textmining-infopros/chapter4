Library websites plays an important role in dissemination of information of the institution and library  resources.  It  acts  as  a  trustworthy  mirror  of  the  institute. To  evaluate  the  library  website  performance  webometric  tools  and  indicators  are  required. The  present  study  calculated  web  impact  factor  (WIF)  and  R-WIF  (Revised  WIF)  of  top  ten  library  websites  of  HEIs  (Higher  Educational  Institutes)  of  India  and further correlated both the formulas with Spearman’s Rank Correlation. It was found that WIF and  R-WIF are correlated  and  associated  which  depicts  that there is very less difference  between  the two  ranking methods. The position of library websites of half HEIs of India is same while evaluating through  both the formulas. After a pilot survey, the list of top ten HEIs of India is extracted from ranking web of  Universities. Google search engine was chosen for the study.

1.  IntroductIon  
Web  impact  factor  (WIF)  and  Revised  web  impact factor (R-WIF) are web versions of the impact  factors  (IF)  published  by  the  Institute  of  Scientific  Information  for  Scientific  Journals  which  is  now  known  as  Thomson  ISI.  The  WIF  was  developed  by Ingwersen1   to  measure  the  impact  of  web  area  by  number  of  links  it  receives  in  a  search  engine.  Ingwersen  used  Alta  Vista  search  engine  to  count  number  of  webpages  whereas  the  present  study  used  Google  search  engine  because  Alta  Vista  search  engine  has  now  merged  with Yahoo  search  engine. 
Bjornborn  and  Ingwersen2   define  webometrics  as  ‘The  study  of  the  quantitative  aspects  of  the  constructions  and  use  of  information  resources,  structures  and  technologies  on  web  drawing  on  bibliometric  and  infometric  approaches.’  According  to  Thelwell3    webometrics  can  also  be  defined  as  ‘The  study  of  web-based  content  with  primarily  quantitative  methods  for  social  science  research  goals using techniques that are not specific to one  field  of  the  study’.  
Thus, webometric tools and techniques aspires  to  generate  new  knowledge  that  guides  to  explain  phenomena of what the institute required to regain or  sustain for its existing position and further provides  scope for improvement in the future. Webometric tools  
and techniques provide in depth appraisal based upon  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  information. 
Library websites play a crucial role for exponential  growth  of  information  regarding  library  attributes.  HEIs in India are spending huge amount of human  as  well  as  capital  resources  to  get  efficient  and  effective  facilities  for  their  users  on  their  library  websites but still users are not able to find out the  required  pages  or  material    they  were  looking  for. 
     
      The scope of the study confines to webometric  study  of  top  10  library  websites  of  HEIs  of  India.  The ranking web of universities is considered for the  list  of  top  10  library  websites  of  HEIs  of  India.

(DNS),  i.e.,  (ac.in).  The  comparisons  of  ranking  of  Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs’) had been done  using  WISER,  WIF  (in  link)  and  World  Rank.  The  WISER ranking and WIF (in link) having correlation,  i.e.,  +0.0558824  which  implied  that  there  was  much association or closeness between two ranking  methods.  WIF  (in  link)  rank  gave  much  closer  value  to  the  World  Rank.  Hence,  the  IIT  Bombay  and  IIT  Madras  secured  first  and  second  position  respectively in WIF (in link) as well as in world rank  whereas WIF (in link) position of IIT Rajasthan had  one  position  better  ranked  than  the  world  ranking,  i.e.,15th   position.  The  findings  of  the  study  would  guide webmasters and library professionals so that  they  could  overcome  the  limitations  faced  by  the  users  and  further  improve  their  websites.  
Baharum  &  Jaafar6   studied  that  users  could  form a schema (mental model help users to interact  with the website) for the location of web objects on  informational websites. The study was investigative and  included logo, internal links, search, advertisement,  external links, site title, login, language, content and  calendar.  94  participants  from  10  Asian  countries  filled  the  questionnaire.  The  study  concluded  that  the advances of technology significantly affect users’  schema  for  the  location  of  the  web  objects  layout  within  4  years. 
Jeyshankar & Maria4  discussed the websites of  universities in Kerala. The paper further calculated  the web impact factor of each kind of links for every  websites  in  Kerala.  Kerala  Agricultural  University  was  ranked  1st   with  12700  webpages  of  all  the  universities  in  Kerala  but  the  University  of  Calicut  was in 2nd  rank according to the web pages. It was  also revealed that Kerala Agricultural University with  0.0002  %  of  self-link  web  impact  factor  occupied  the  last  rank  even  though  it  had  12700  webpages  because it had lowest number of external links (32). So,  at  the  end  authors  concluded  that  to  use  the  links of the universities could be act as parameters  to  some  extent  to  show  the  websites  webpages  and  the  results  should  not  specifically  rests  on  a  particular  link. 
Tafaroji  &  Tahamtan7   studied  the  findings  of  webometric analysis of websites of medical universities  of Iran. Majestic SEO software and search engines like  Google, Yahoo and Bing. The number of webpages,  in  links  and  rich  files  were  calculated  for  these  43  universities.  The  findings  indicated  a  significance  relationship between webometric universities ranking  in  Iranian  Ministry  of  Health.  The  study  further  indicated  that  the  use  of  rich  files  could  be  a  better  and  more  reliable  view  of  Iranian  medical  universities  ranking. 
Krishna  Kumar  &  Nirmala8     analysed  websites  of Research Council of India through webometrics.

Alexa  Traffic  Rank  and  the  Global  Rank  were  considered  for  the  study.  This  study  revealed  an  overall  preview  of  the  traffic  and  page  ranks  of  Research  Councils  of  India  websites. 
Shukla & Tripathi9  examined the extent of back  links  to  different  categories  of  web-pages  of  the  library  websites  belonging  to  institutes  of  national  importance and premier library websites of management  institutions  in  India.  The  study  concluded  with  the  remarks  that  Yahoo  site  explorer  had  retrieved  maximum number of back links. This indicated that  Yahoo site explorer was more reliable than Google,  All  the  Web  and AltaVista  in  terms  of  back  links 
Moghaddam & Farshid10   studied that webometrics  serves as a method for identifying the most accredited  free  e  journals  of  Medical  Sciences.  It  has  been  found that information collected from and about links  between  web-pages  and  websites  can  reflect  real  world  phenomena  and  relationships  between  their  organisations.  Further,  authors  concluded  with  the  remarks  that  there  should  be  interlinking  for  free  e-journals  between  the  local  bodies. 
Jayshree & Ravichandran11 explore URL citation  analysis of eighty two technical and science education  institutions  from  the  website  department  of  higher  education, Ministry of Human Resource Development,  Government of India's website. URL citation analysis  is one of the methods for web impact assessment.  Spearman  and  Chi-square  analysis  were  used  to  highlight  the  relationship  between  the  institution  groups  and  website  categories.  Chi-square  test  reveals  that  the  National  Institutes  of  Technology  had  more  impact  in  each  category  of  websites. 
Prabakaran  &  Lihitbar12   aim  to  analysed  the  17  Space  Science  Library  websites  in  the  world.  The  data  was  collected  on  number  of  webpages,  external  links,  in  links,  self  links  and  total  links  of  the  websites.  Various  web  impact  factors  were  calculated on the basis of the web links and ranked  the  websites.  The  study  concluded  that  the  need  for  ranking  of  library  website  in  space  research  organisation  was  to  serve  the  users  by  providing  better  services  through  their  websites. 
Since 2004, the ranking web or webometrics is  the largest academic ranking of Higher Educational  Institutions of the world. Cybermetrics Lab (Spanish  National  Research  Council,  CSIC)  performed  this  exercise  every  6  months  for  providing  reliable,   multidimensional,  updated  and  useful  information  about  the  performance  of  Universities  from  all  over  the  world  based  on  their  web  presence  and  impact.  After  every  6  months  previous  reports  are  regenerated so that each website reflects the current  state  of  dbase  of  all  times.  No  fake  universities  are  included  by  the  ranking  web  of  universities.  Rather, it is found that users stop showing interest

in  the  library  websites  if  they  could  not  find  their  requirements.  Thus,  it  is  the  need  of  the  hour  to  evaluate  the  library  websites  through  WIF  and  R-WIF.  Further,  Spearman’s  Rank  Correlation  has  been  used  to  correlate  these  formulas.    
3.  objEctIvES 
The  obectives  of  the  present  study  are  to: •	 Find the number of self link pages, in link pages  
and  external  link  pages  of  library  websites  of  
HEIs  of  India; 
•	 Calculate WIF and R-WIF of library websites of  
top  ten  HEIs  of  India;  and 
•	 Calculate the correlation between WIF and R-WIF  
of  library  websites  of  HEIs  of  India  through  
Spearman’s  Rank  Correlation. 
4.  MEtHodo LoGy 
For  calculation  of  WIF  and  R-WIF  of  library  websites  of  HEIs  of  India,  an  appropriate  search  engine  is  required.  The  search  engine  should  be  enormous,  cover  more  hyperlinks  with  advanced  search  facilities  to  count  links  possessed  by  the  websites. Google search engine possessed the above  criteria  and  is  safer  and  covers  more  hyperlinks  as  compared  to  other  search  engines.  In  present  study, therefore, Google was used to determine the  requirements of both the formulas. Utilising Boolean  operators  different  formulations  were  used  which  resulted in different outcomes. Google search engine  is  used  to  collect  data,  i.e.,  number  of  webpages,  number  of  In-links  and  number  of  self  links. •	 WP=Total number of webpages extracted in Google,  
for  example,  site:  www.library.iitb.ac.in.  •	 SL=Number  of  self-links  will  be  extracted  in  
Google, for example, site: www. Library.iitb.ac.in  
AND  link  domain:  www.  library.iitb.ac.in.  •	 IL= Number of In-links will be extracted in Google  
for  example,  site:  www.  library.  Iitb.ac.in  NOT  
link  domain:  www.  Library.  iitb.ac.in.  
•	 Web  Impact  Factor  (WIF)  can  be  calculated  by  
adding  number  of  In-links  and  number  of  Self- 
links extracted in Google divided by total number  
of  web  pages  extracted  in  Google,  i.e.,    
         WIF = IL + SL/WP 
•	 Revised Web Impact Factor (R-WIF) can be calculated  
by dividing number of In-links extracted in Google with  
total number of web pages extracted in Google, i.e., 
           R-WIF = IL/WP 
•	 Spearman’s  Rank  Correlation-The  relationship  
between  WIF  and  R-WIF  can  be  established  
through  the  correlation  coefficient  (r).  In  the  
present study, the Spearman’s Rank Correlation  
has  been  used. 
According  to  this  method, 
5.   AnALySIS 
The  results  were  extracted  on  25th   April,  2015  from  Google  search  engine. 
5.1 ranking  of top ten  HEIs 
Table 1 shows that ranking from both the formulas  gives approximately same results. It was found that  ranking of five library websites is same in both the  formulas.  These  are  website  of  Central  library  IIT  Delhi  (1st   rank),website  of    J.R.D.  Tata  Memorial   Library (2nd   rank),  website  of  Central  library-  Delhi  University  Library  System  (3rd   rank),  website  of  Central  Library  IIT  Bombay  (4th   rank),  website  of  Anna University Central library (9th  rank).On the other  hand,  website  of  Central  library  IIT  Madras  ranked  5th   while  evaluating  through  WIF  and  ranked  10 
th while evaluating through R-WIF. Website of Central  library  IIM  Bangalore  ranked  6th   while  evaluating  through WIF and ranked 8th  while evaluating through  R-WIF.  Website  of  Scientific  Information  Resource  Centre  ranked  7th   rank  while  ranking  through  WIF  and  ranked  6th   while  evaluating  through  R-WIF.  Website  of  Central  library  IIT  Kanpur  ranked  8th while evaluating through WIF and ranked 7th   while  evaluating  through  R-WIF.  Website  of  Library-SRM  University ranked last while evaluating through WIF  and  ranked  5th   while  ranking  through  R-WIF. 
5.2 relationship  between  WIF  and r-WIF 
The  relationship  between  WIF  and  R-WIF  can  be established through the correlation coefficient(r).  The  correlation  coefficient  (r)  relates  the  strength  and  direction  of  linear  relationship  between  two  variables. The coefficient of determination represents  the  percent  of  the  data  that  is  the  closest  to  the  line  of  best  fit.  Correlation  is  always  between  -1.0  and  +1.0.  If  the  correlation  is  positive,  we  have  a  positive relationship. If it is negative, the relationship  is  negative.  In  the  present  study  the  Spearman’s  Rank  Correlation  has  been  used  (Table  2). 
According  to  this  method, 
where, 	 X=R-WIF, 	 Y=WIF, 	 Σ=Algebraic 	 sum; 
N=Number. 
Thus,  the  correlation  coefficient  (r)  can  be  calculated as mentioned above. The values used in  the 	 formula 	 are: 	 Number 	 (N) 	 = 	 10; 	 ΣX 	 =6.40; 	 ΣY 	 = 	 15.43; 	 ΣXY 	 = 	 27.5; 	 ΣX2 	 =12.8; 	 ΣY2   =60.728
