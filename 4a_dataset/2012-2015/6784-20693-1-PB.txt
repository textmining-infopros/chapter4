The web has transformed the ways by which people search, fnd, use and communicate information.  Integrating the use of web 2.0 technology in libraries has become the subject of interest among library  professionals.  Web  2.0  technologies  facilitate  interactive  information  sharing,  interoperability,  user- centered design, dynamic content, openness, and user participation. This paper assesses the web 2.0  technology skills among library professionals in the University of Kerala. The study includes the library  professionals  employed  in  the  Kerala  university  library  system. The  questionnaire  was  the  instrument  used for data collection. The study revealed that e-mail has an important impact on the level of web 2.0  use among library professionals. The majority of the library professionals did not have much idea about  RSS feeds, content management, social bookmarking, podcast, wikis, etc. Analysis also showed that the  library professionals in University of Kerala have a positive attitude towards the implementation of web  2.0 technologies in libraries. The paper concludes that Kerala university library is in a developing stage  
in its infrastructure and use of ICT.

1. INTrODUcTION 
Information and communication technology (ICT)  has  changed  the  traditional  concept  of  library  and  information  centres  to  a  global  information  hub  accessible  anywhere  and  anytime.  This  is  mainly  because of the way the ICT tools and services such  as  web,  networks,  internet,  etc.,  have  influenced  the library services. The ICT has made reasonable  impact  on  library  users  and  the  way  they  want  information  as  it  provides  new  opportunities  for  information  retrieval.  The  growing  impact  of  ICT  and  web  technologies  has  compelled  the  libraries  to  use  these  technologies  effectively  to  provide  services  to  the  users  according  to  their  demands.  With  the  support  of  University  Grants  Commission  (UGC)  and  INFLIBNET,  university  libraries  in  India  are  on  their  way  of  modernisation  through  various  programmes including UGC INFONET and e-journal  consortium.  Thus, it is important to note that there  is  an  urgent  need  of  skilled  personnel  for  the  implementation of latest technology-aided services in  libraries.  These  issues  make  it  necessary  to  study  the  new  web  2.0  technology  skills  needed  for  the  information professionals in this changing scenario.  
Here, an attempt has been made to assess the web  2.0 technology skills among library professionals in  the  University  of  Kerala. 
Web  2.0  technologies  have  great  potential  to  enhance  the  delivery  of  library  services  and  to  contribute  to  the  professional  development  of  library  staff.  According  to  Coombs1,  web  2.0  can  be  defined  as  'a  space  that  allows  anyone  to  create  and  share  information  online  –  a  space  for  collaboration, conversation, and interaction; a space  that  is  highly  dynamic,  flexible,  and  adaptable'.  Web 2.0 has created new opportunities for librarians  to  deliver  best  services  to  the  users  even  if  they  are  geographically  distributed.  The  applications  of  web  2.0  technologies  in  libraries  and  library  professionals  are  very  well  seen  in  the  initiatives  of  Elsevier  Inc.  Elsevier  has  developed  several  applications  that  use  the  web  services  including  Patient  Research,  RefWorks,  Quosa,  2Collab,  etc.  Users can benefit from RSS on Engineering Village,  Scopus and ScienceDirect. Elsevier also offers RSS  alert  service  like  Library  Connect  News,  tagging  service on Engineering Village and podcast service  on  ScienceDirect  news2.

DJLIT,  VOL.  34,  NO.  5,  SEPTEMBER  2014 
The University of Travancore, which later became  the  University  of  Kerala,  was  established  in  1937.  The Kerala University Library (KUL), established in  1942, has over 3 lakh books and over 1000 bound  volumes  of  journals3.  Kerala  University  Library  system comprises of the Central Library at Palayam,  the  Campus  Library  and  College  of  Engineering  Library  at  Kariavattom  campus,  42  departmental  libraries,  and  3  study  centre  libraries  (Alappuzha,  Pandalam, and Kollam). The library system follows  a  decentralised  pattern  with  a  central  library  and  departmental  libraries  attached  to  the  teaching  departments  of  the  university.  The  library  staff  in  KUL  system  are  liable  to  work  in  the  central  and  departmental libraries4. Recently, the 42 departments  have been reorganised into eleven schools and these  departments  have  independent  libraries  managed  by  library  professionals.  But  libraries  in  a  few  departments  do  not  have  permanent  library  staff.  2.   r EVIEW  OF rELATED  LITErATUrE 
A  number  of  studies  have  been  conducted  to  explore  the  needed  competencies  of  librarians  to  meet  the  challenges  of  web  2.0  technologies.  Kumar & Ranjan5  revealed that the main reasons of non-adaption  of  social  media  in  libraries  were  lack  of  computer  literacy,  unavailability  of  computers,  and  unawareness  about  social  media.  Chakravarty  &  Chopra6   described  how  the  IIT  and  IIM  libraries  provide access to their collection and user support  for all that access using web 2.0 technologies such  as synchronous messaging, streaming media, blogs,  wiki, and social networking. It was surprising to find  that  most  of  the  IITs  and  IIMs  are  yet  to  integrate  web 2.0 in their websites.  Sawant7   found  that  LIS  instructors, in some Indian universities, have a low  level  of  familiarity  regarding  the  use  of  web  2.0.  
Sudhakaran & Sivankutty8  revealed that majority  of  the  librarians  possess  web  2.0  skills  and  social  networking,  blogging  and  wikis  are  their  choice  of  use.  Mahalakshmi  &  Sornam9   revealed  that  library  professionals  are  aware  of  the  few  social  networking  sites  and  have  fair  knowledge  in  using  social  networking  sites  to  market  library  services  and resources. Joint10  provided a summary of some  of the legal and ethical issues associated with web  2.0 applications in libraries, with a brief retrospective  view  of  some  relevant  literature.  The  concept  of  web 2.0 such as social networks, RSS feeds, blogs,  streaming  media,  podcasts,  wikis,  tags,  mashups,  etc.,  were  defined  and  the  possible  applications  of  these  technologies  in  various  library  functions  and  activities  were  mentioned  by Aqil, et  al. 
11. 
Seena & Sudhier12   in  their  study  revealed  that  the  professionals  have  relatively  average  level  of  skills  in  handling  ICT  related  tasks  and  identified  that lack of training as the main factor that hinders  ICT use in libraries. Tyagi13  in his study on the use  
420 
of web 2.0 technology by engineering college library  professionals observed that the respondents having  good  skill  in  usage  of  internet  were  more  inclined  towards  the  new  technology.  Kaushik  &  Arora14 identified  blogs  on  marketing  of  library  services  and examined their features during Jan-June 2009.  Analysis showed that 6 blogs on marketing of library  services  are  active  and  cover  variety  of  features,  frequency, file formats, web resource categories, and  subjects  including  marketing.  Majumdar15   revealed  that  IIT,  Kharagpur  and  ISI,  Kolkata  have  applied  web  2.0  tools  in  their  respective  library  webpage  and none of the state universities has applied web  2.0  tools  in  their  webpage.  
3. ObJEcTIVEs 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
(i) Identify the choice of web 2.0 technology used  
by  the  library  professionals  under  the  study.  (ii)  Assess  the  level/extent  of  skills  of  library  
professionals  in  using  different  types  of  web  
2.0  technologies. 
(iii) Evaluate  the  attitude  towards  the  web  2.0  
application by library professionals in the University  
of  Kerala. 
(iv)  Suggest  the  measures  for  the  improvement  of  
web  2.0  technology  skill  development  for  the  
LIS  professionals. 
4. METHODOLOGY 
The  present  study  is  confined  to  the  library  professionals  of  the  central,  campus,  College  of  Engineering and departmental libraries in the University  of Kerala. The  study  was  based  on  survey  method  and  in  that  questionnaire  was  used  as  the  tool  to  collect data. A structured questionnaire was designed,  keeping  in  view  the  basic  objectives  of  the  study.  The  questionnaire  of  the  research  consists  of  both  optional type and statements in Lickert’s 5-point scale.  The study confined only to the library professionals;  categories  such  as  para-professionals,  university  administrators, etc., are excluded. Further, the study  centre  libraries  located  at  Alappuzha,  Pandalam  and  Kollam  are  not  included.  Out  of  130  library  professionals  employed  in  the  Kerala  University  Library  system,  questionnaires  were  distributed  to  115  library  professionals  and  102  dully  filled  in  questionnaires  were  received.  The  collected  data  was  analysed  using  latest  version  of  MS-Excel  for  appropriate  statistical  analysis  and  description.  
Statistical technique such as Weighted Arithmetic  Mean (WAM) was used for the analysis. The WAM technique was used to assess the level of variation  among  the  variables.  To  give  the  due  importance,  a  score  called  weight  was  assigned  to  variables  considering the relative importance of each variable.

5.1 General  Information  of  respondents 
It was found that majority of library professionals  who have responded to the survey in the University  of Kerala were females (60.78 %) and 40 (39.22 %)  were  males. As  far  as  the  age  of  the  respondents  is  concerned,  72  of  them  fall  below  45  years  and  30 were between 46-55 year of age, depicting that  the young professionals are more in number which  is  effective  to  work  with  technical  skills.  Table  1  shows  61.76  %  of  the  respondents  have  a  PG  degree  and  38.24  %  have  basic  degree  in  their  basic subject. It is clear from the table that most of  the  library  professionals  (37.25  %)  possess  MA  as  basic qualification. A few of the professionals have  additional technical qualifications like DCA (18.63 %),  and PGDCA (9.80 %), in addition to the basic Post  Graduate  qualification.  It  is  also  evident  from  the  table that the LIS professionals in the University of  Kerala have high average of professional qualification.  The  basic  qualification  for  entry  cadre  as  a  library  professional in universities being degree with BLIS,  it  can  be  seen  that  professionals  having  only  BLIS  degree are least, while 59 (57.84 %) professionals  possess  MLIS,  and  9  with  PhD  as  the  highest  professional qualification. Half of the professionals have  experience ranging 6-15 years. It was also found that 32 (31.37 %) respondents were Assistant Librarians,  followed  by  30  (29.41  %)  Technical Assistants.

5.2 Extent  of  Different  Types  Web  2.0  
Technology skills 
5.2.1 Use  of  Web  2.0  Technology Applications 
It  is  important  to  know  how  well  the  web  2.0  technologies are made use of by LIS professionals to  better serve the community. The library professionals  were  asked  to  indicate  their  choice  of  using  different  categories  of  web  2.0  technologies  and  the  result  is  presented  in  Fig.  1.  A  study  of  the  chart  indicated  that  majority  of  them  (93.14  %)  have preferred e-mail as first choice of importance  revealing  that  e-mail  has  an  impact  on  the  level  of  web  2.0  use  among  library  professionals.  This  result  is  in  line  with  the  findings  of  Susan17   who  
showed that most of the library professionals prefer  e-mail,  instant  messaging  and  chat.  It  is  worth  to  note  that  the  web  2.0  technologies  which  can  be  effectively  applied  in  library  and  information  science field such as social bookmarking (37.25 %),  RSS  feeds  (28.43  %)  were  not  much  been  used  by  the  professionals.  The  analysis  also  showed  that  the  reference  management  system  (24.51  %)  and  the  content  management  system  (19.61  %)  were  the  least  used  web  2.0  technologies.    5.2.2    Skills  for  Managing  Web  2.0  Tools  and 
Services 
With the development of web 1.0, web 2.0 and  3.0, many web-based services have been introduced  in  libraries  to  provide  better  services  to  users.  Realising  its  importance,  the  study  assessed  the

knowledge of LIS professionals on these technologies  and  the  collected  data  have  been  tabulated  in  Table  2  with  weighted  arithmetic  mean  (WAM)  values  and  rank  order.  Based  on  the  5-point  Likert  scale respondents’ awareness was assessed on 13  web  2.0  technologies.  To  calculate  WAM,  a  score/  weight was assigned to each scale viz., score of 5  was  allotted  to  the  scale  ‘Excellent’,  4  for  ‘Above  Average’,  3  for  ‘Average’,  2  for  ‘Below  Average’  ,  and  1  for  ‘Extremely  Poor’. 
It  is  evident  from  the  table  that  most  of  the  professionals in the University of Kerala are aware of

the web 2.0 tools. But the fact that hindering the use  of web 2.0 applications in libraries is the low level of  skills of LIS professionals in handling them. Among  the listed technologies the highest WAM value was  shown in the use of e-mail (24.67) followed by instant  messaging  (21.93).  Findings  revealed  that  most  of  the LIS professionals possess relatively low level of  skill in using social bookmarking and RSS feeds with  WAM value 16.13 and 14.47 respectively. The results  obtained  were  similar  to  those  of  Sudhakaran  and  Sivankutty8   who  revealed  that  library  professionals  have a low level of awareness in services like RSS,

need  training  especially  in  these  areas.  It  is  also  worth  to  note  that  the  number  of  respondents  indicated  their  skill  as  ‘excellent’  in  using  various  web tools is only <20 in number. Calculation of WAM  for  the  first  two  entries  i.e.,  ‘Blogging’  and  ‘Audio/ Video  sharing’  has  been  shown  in  Table  3. 5.2.3 Respondents’  Attitude  Towards  Web  2.0  
Applications 
Table 4 reveals the attitude of library professionals  towards the use of web 2.0 technologies in libraries  and  the  respective  WAM  values  with  rank.  For  the  analysis  of  respondents’  attitude,  score  5  was  assigned  to  most  favorable  response  and  score  1  for least favorable in the case of positive statement.  For  negative  statement  the  scoring  was  reversed.  
It  is  clear  from Table  4  that  majority  (29.53)  of  the  professionals  were  strongly  agreed  that  web  2.0 applications enhance communication with WAM  and  rank  1,  followed  by  29.07  web  2.0  enhance  professional networking of librarians with WAM. This  result is somehow in line with the findings of Khan  & Bhatti18  who revealed that web 2.0 technology like  social media helps in knowledge sharing and locating  information  in  libraries.  It  is  observed  that  there  are  only  slight  variations  in  the  values  of  WAM  in  determining the ranks assessed by the respondents  for  their  attitudes.  This  supports  the  fact  that  the  library  professionals  in  University  of  Kerala  have

The numerous views and comments offered by the  library professionals have enabled the investigator to offer  some feasible suggestion for the successful application  of  ICT  and  web  2.0  technologies  in  libraries:  (i)  The LIS professionals should provided with the  
training for online communication tools (blog, podcast,  
wikis, RSS, content management, etc.) to make  
them confident users. This also empowers librarians  
with  high  specialised  knowledge  and  skills.    (ii)  Sufficient funds should be made available by the  
authorities for developments of ICT infrastructure,  
digital  resource  development,  and  application  
of  ICT-enabled  services  in  university  libraries.  (iii)  The  authorities  need  to  review  their  policies  
regarding  the  implementation  of  technological  
developments  in  libraries. 
(iv)  Library  users  should  also  be  given  motivation  
by organising orientation programmes and user  
awareness  programmes  in  ICT.    
(v)  A new model curriculum for information science  
courses  in  universities  should  be  devised  by  
integrating the traditional and modern knowledge  
and  applications.

In the changed scenario of web technology and  scholarly communications, university libraries should  manage the research output, organisational knowledge  and information resources that support R&D activities  by using library blogs, library websites, institutional  repositories,  etc.  The  web  2.0  technologies  can  be  used  for  developing  interpersonal  cooperation  among librarians and to get new information on any  subject.  Librarians  mainly  use  these  technologies  for  sending  email,  chat  and  social  networks.  The  web  2.0  technologies  which  can  be  effectively  applied in library and information science field such  as  blog,  wikis,  RSS,  content  management,  social  bookmarking,  podcast,  etc.,  are  not  much  used  by  the  professionals  satisfactorily.  Social  networking  sites generally appeal to younger generation. Thus  many  sections  of  the  population  particularly  the  elderly  users  will  not  be  reached  by  such  efforts.  The  main  hurdles  faced  by  library  professionals  in  acquiring  the  skills  in  using  these  technologies  are  lack  of  proper  training  and  lack  of  proper  infrastructure, planning and supervision. As services  for  users  increasingly  come  to  expect  interactive  online  services  in  all  sphere  of  life,  libraries  must  keep pace with developments to ensure responsive  services  for  the  future.
