ABSTRACT
The Indian pharmaceutical industry (IPI) has been largely influenced by the changes in the patent regimes
in India. This paper, besides reviewing the evolution of IPI, studies the trends of research and development
(R&D) and patenting of pharmaceutical firms and identifies the determinants of R&D. It examines the
interdependence between R&D and patenting, and firms’ overall performance. Secondary data analysis indicates
that the product patent regime has impacted the R&D intensity of IPI firms. The analysis of primary data
collected from 64 pharmaceutical firms identifies three distinct clusters of firms of IPI. The firms’ performance,
measured by the rate of capital employed by the three groups of firms, indicates that superior R&D and a large
number of patent filings need not necessarily imply a better performance. The paper adds to the extant
literature on IPI by bringing forth implications which are important for formulating appropriate action plans to
enable pharmaceutical firms to efficiently employ their resources in the product patent era.
Keywords: Indian pharmaceutical industry, patents, patent regime, Tobit, ROCE, cluster analysis, return on capital

1. INTRODUCTION
In recent times, technological innovation, low
production and research and development (R&D) costs
and availability of a huge skilled, well-educated, Englishspeaking manpower have propelled India’s economic
growth and competitiveness1. Technology-intensive
sectors, like the pharmaceutical industry, have put India
onto the global business atlas, with the Indian
pharmaceutical industry (IPI) accounting for 10 per cent of
world’s production by volume and 1.5 per cent in terms of
value2. The evolution of IPI can be broadly divided into four
phases, in congruence with the changes in patenting
regimes followed in the country. The first phase (1911 1970) was that of the product patent regime, established
by the Patents and Designs Act, 1911. The regime helped
multi-national companies (MNCs) to rule the Indian
market by importing bulk drugs and processing these into
formulations. Indigenous firms, in contrast, had to
produce the corresponding bulk drugs for their
formulations. The second phase (1970-1995) started with
the replacement of product patents by process patents,
introduced by Indian Patents Act, 1970. This phase
enabled Indian firms to manufacture drugs using less
expensive processes than those developed by the
Received 09 December 2011, online published 18 May 2012

innovators, thereby boosting the growth of the indigenous
firms vis-à-vis that of MNCs3. During the third phase
(1995-2005), Patents (Amendment) Act, 1999, and
Patents (Amendment) Act, 2002, were enacted, which
provided for the implementation of the ‘mail box’,
‘exclusive marketing rights’ facilities and ‘compulsory
licensing’, in conformance with the provisions of World
Trade Organisation’s Trade Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights4.
With the establishment of a product patent regime by
the enactment of Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005, drugs
patented after 1995 were not allowed to be produced
through reverse engineering5. Since 1995, the operational
environment of the firms of IPI has undergone a
tremendous transformation. The changed environment of
patenting in India witnessed rapid alterations in the firms’
operational and growth strategies6. Firms have resorted to
setting up R&D units, demerger of R&D units from
manufacturing set-ups, strong collaborations with
research laboratories and separation of generics
segment4,7. MNCs have viewed this changed patent era as
an opportunity to expand their pharmaceutical business
and acquired large firms8. In the new regime, the twopronged strategy of MNCs has been to target the mass
228

market through ‘product localisation and India specific
pricing’ to capture the branded generics segment; and
‘launch globally patented products in niche segments at a
premium’9,10. In this backdrop, this paper examines the
trend of R&D and patenting of firms of IPI and identifies the
determinants of R&D. It tests the underlying hypothesis
that distinct groups of firms, identified according to the
R&D activities and patenting trends, have performance
differentials.

This study relies on both secondary and primary data
and covers all large firms of IPI. Large firms are those
firms which have a minimum investment of Rs. 10 crore on
plant and machinery1. The reference period of this study is
from 2001-02 to 2008-09, i.e. the last four years of the
process patent regime and the first four years of the
product patent regime. As per data available from the
Prowess database of Centre for Monitoring Indian
Economy (CMIE), during the year 2008-09 there were 183
such pharmaceutical firms.

2.1 Secondary Data
Secondary data analysis covers data of all 183 large
firms for the years 2001-02 to 2008-09. To understand the
R&D behaviour of IPI, the R&D intensity of pharmaceutical
  Tobit model
firms was estimated, using a Tobit model. The
was found to be appropriate for the analysis because the
dependent variable, R&D intensity, is continuous, but its
range is constrained11 since a large number of firms in the
sample do not have R&D activities, rendering a null value
for the dependent variable. The description of the
independent variables and their expected relationship with
the dependent variable is given in Table 1. The relationship
between the dependent and independent variables in the
Tobit model used in this study can be presented in the
following form:
RDI=β 1 PRdum+β 2 Odum+β 3 A+β 4 S+β 5 S 2 +β 6 KM+

where, RDI is the dependent variable; β is the vector of
unknown parameters which determine the relationship
between the independent variables and the latent variable;
and Xi is the vector of explanatory variables.

Due to some missing data, an unbalanced panel data
of 173 firms for eight years was used. The firm-year
observations were 1,243.

2010. Based on discussions held with experts drawn
from the industry, Government of India and academia, on
important aspects of IPI, a questionnaire for the firm-level
survey was prepared and administered to the
pharmaceutical firms. The questionnaire was of closed
type and included questions regarding R&D and patents.
The firms were asked to indicate their perception on a five
point Likert scale. A pre-testing of the questionnaire was
done on a sample of 21 pharmaceutical firms through
personal interviews and e-mails. Changes, wherever
necessary, were made according to the feedback
received from the pre-testing.
Thereafter, the final questionnaire was e-mailed to all
the firms. This was followed up by telephone calls and
personal interviews. Sixty four responses were found
suitable for analysis. Keeping in view the multivariate
nature of the factors/variables incorporated into the
questionnaire, cluster analysis was found to be the
suitable statistical tool for analysis12. The responses
received were subjected to a cluster analysis with the
help of Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Initially,
the number of clusters was found out by running a
hierarchical cluster analysis of the responses.
Agglomeration schedule and dendrograms were used to
group the firms according to the similarity in their R&D
and patenting characteristics. With the help of Euclidean
measure of distance, the firms with similarities (which
were a short distance apart), and those with
229

dissimilarities (which were a long distance apart), were
found to form three distinct groups, with firms within the
groups showing similar characteristics. The number of
clusters was identified by the distances between the
clusters and by a sudden gap in the distance coefficients.
Having identified the number of clusters as three, a kmeans cluster option was run on the data. The final
cluster centres were obtained for each variable. From the
final cluster centres, the average values of each variable
for a cluster were interpreted. Return on capital employed
(ROCE) is a popular performance measure and relates
the profits of a firm to the capital employed by it13. Capital
employed refers to long-term funds supplied by the
lenders and owners of the firm. ROCE is calculated as:
A high ROCE indicates an efficient use of the capital
employed. To estimate performance differentials across
the three different groups of firms identified by the cluster
analysis, ROCE was used.

3. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS
3.1 Secondary Data
For the pharmaceutical industry, the number of patent
applications recorded an annual quantum jump of 161.4
per cent during 2003-04, a year prior to the introduction of
the product patent regime (Table 2).

As a proportion of total patent applications in the
country, the IPI recorded its largest share (20 %) during
2003-04. Thereafter, although there have been some
fluctuations in the share of IPI in total patent applications
in the country, the IPI maintained a minimum share of 9
per cent in the subsequent years (2004-05 to 2008-09)
and the absolute number of applications continued to
remain high.
There were 71 large firms which had filed applications
for patents either in India or abroad during 2001-02 to
2008-0915, 16. Of these, 29 firms applied for Indian patents,
10 filed for patents outside the country and 32 filed for
patents both within India and outside. Between 2001-02
and 2008-09, within India, 3,241 patents had been filed by
61 firms. Outside India, 43 firms had applied for 1,667
patents during the same period. There is a heavy
concentration of firms which have less than five patent
applications in both India and abroad (Table 3). On the
other end of the spectrum, there are very few firms with
more than 100 applications. There are eight firms with
applications of more than 100 within the country and four
have more than 100 filings outside the country. Each of
the 14 firms which had patent filings of more than 50 in
India, also had filings outside the country. The 24 firms
which had less than five patents in India, had not filed for
any patents outside the country.
The focus of IPI is shifting towards R&D, with more
and more firms spending larger shares of their sales on
R&D (Table 4). Between 2001-02 and 2008-09, the

proportion of firms investing more than 3 per cent of their
sales in R&D activities grew from 14.5 per cent to 23.8 per
cent. Despite an increase in the number of firms incurring
R&D expenses, a large proportion (66.4 per cent) of the
firms either did not invest at all or invested less than 1 per
cent of their total sales on R&D in 2008-09.
The determinants of R&D intensity of firms of IPI were
identified using a Tobit model. The coefficients of the
dummies for patent regime, ‘PRdum’, and ownership
‘Odum’, were significant, implying that the new patent
regime and domestic ownership were likely to contribute
significantly to R&D intensity (Table 5).
The variables, size, measured by sales, ‘S’, and the
square of size, ‘S2’, were significant and indicated an
inverted ‘U’ shaped relationship with the dependent
variable. The coefficient of the intensity of imports of
capital goods, ‘KM’, was positive and significant,
indicating a complementary relationship with in-house
R&D.
The coefficient of profit rate, ‘PR’, was significant and
positively related to the dependent variable. The
coefficients of other independent variables did not have a
significant impact on the dependent variable. Thus, the
patent regime was found to be an important determinant
of R&D intensity, along with domestic ownership, size of
firms, intensity of capital imports, and profit rate.

3.2 Primary Data
Out of the 64 firms which participated in the primary
survey, there were 60 indigenous respondents and four
MNCs. Each of the respondents had their own in-house
R&D units, within India. On an average, a firm invested
Rs. 1,971 crore on plant and machinery. During the
reference period, 2001-02 to 2008-09, the firms reported
annual average domestic sales of Rs. 4,315 crore and
annual average exports of Rs. 1,495 crore.
The annual average R&D investment during the
reference period was Rs. 241 crore, with an intensity of
5.6 per cent. Besides these quantitative variables,
respondents were asked to indicate their preferences on
other parameters like nature of R&D activities, R&D
laboratories, R&D personnel, IPR, collaboration with
research institutes, R&D strategy and patents.
The responses of these firms were subjected to
cluster analysis. From the analysis, three groups
emerged (Table 6). The first group consisted of six firms,
the second and third groups had 17 and 39 firms,
respectively. Amongst the three groups of firms, some of
the firms of the first group were found to be investing on
R&D related to new products. All the remaining firms were
engaged in R&D entailing new processes and
modifications in existing products and processes. The
first group had the highest mean number of patent
applications both in India and outside the country.
Besides, it had the highest mean R&D intensity.
The mean ROCE of the first group was the lowest and
that of the second group was the highest. One-way
ANOVA procedure showed that the ROCE means of the
three groups were significantly different from each other at

The focus of IPI is shifting towards R&D, with more
and more firms spending larger shares of their sales on
R&D. The number of patent applications of IPI has
continued to remain high since 2003-04. The product
patent regime has impacted the R&D intensity of IPI
firms. The patent regime is an important determinant of
R&D intensity, along with domestic ownership, size of
firms, intensity of capital imports and profit rate. An
analysis of performance differentials between firms of IPI
indicated that superior R&D and a large number of patents
need not necessarily imply a better performance of firms.
The policy implications of this study are important for
the pharmaceutical industry for formulating appropriate
action plans to enable firms to efficiently employ their
resources in the new patent era. In-house R&D conducted
by pharmaceutical firms would get a further boost if their
research is backed by industry-academia collaborations.
Indian firms need to revisit the spectrum of activities
involved in their R&D, so that these culminate in patents.
