1.    IN tRODUCtION 
Oral  cancer  or  mouth  cancer  affects  the  oral  cavity. The oral cavity is the first part of the digestive  tract.  It  is  a  complex  structure  with  nutritional  respiratory  and  communicative  functions.  Bound  by hard and soft tissues, it includes the upper and  lower teeth, the tongue, the salivary glands, mucosal  glands,  the  various  freni,  and  the  rugae  over  the  hard  palate.  The  mouth  is  bound  interiorly  by  the  lips,  on  the  lateral  aspect  by  the  cheeks.  Its  roof  is  formed  by  the  hard  palate  and  inferiorly  by  the  mucosa covering the superior surface of the tongue  and the sheet of muscles attaching to the inner side  of  mandible. The  oral  cavity  is  continuous  with  the  pharyngeal  cavity,  a  more  complex  and  somewhat  irregular  space1.  
There  are  several  types  of  oral  cancers,  some  being squamous cell carcinomas, veracious carcinomas,  salivary  gland  carcinomas,  lymphomas,  malignant

melanoma,  and  others.  More  than  9  of  10  cancers  of  the  oral  cavity  are  squamous  cell  carcinomas,  also  called  squamous  cell  cancers.  These  cancers  begin  in  early  forms  of  squamous  cells,  which  are  flat,  scale-like  cells  that  normally  form  the  lining  of  the  mouth  and  throat.  Verrucous  carcinoma  is  a  type  of  squamous  cell  carcinoma  that  makes  up  less  than  5  %  of  all  oral  cancers.  It  is  a  low- grade (slow growing) cancer that rarely spreads to  other parts of the body, but it can grow deeply into  surrounding tissue. Minor salivary gland cancers can  develop in the glands in the lining of the mouth and  throat.  There  are  several  types  of  minor  salivary  gland cancers, including adenoid cystic carcinoma,  mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and polymorphous low- grade adenocarcinoma. The tonsils and base of the  tongue  contain  immune  system  (lymphoid)  tissue,  where  cancers  called  lymphomas  can  start2. 
Oral cancer was the 15th  most common cancer  in the world, with nearly 300,000 new cases in 2012,

contributing  2.1  %  share  of  the  total  worldwide  new  cancer  cases  diagnosed  in  2012.  In  men  and  women,  oral  cancer  was  the  11th   and  17 
th 
  most  common cases in the world, with nearly 199,000 and  101,000  new  cases  diagnosed  worldwide  in  2012,  contributing  to  2.7  %  and  1.5  %  share  of  the  total  new  cancer  cases  diagnosed  in  2012.  The  male  and  female  crude  incidence  rate  was  5.6  and  2.9  and  age  standardised  incidence  rate  5.5  and  2.5  in  mouth  cancer  in  2012.  Oral  cancer  resulted  in  145,328 deaths (97919 in men and 47409 in women)  in 2012.  The men and women crude mortality rate  was  2.8  and  1.4  and  age  standardised  mortality  rate  2.7  and  1.2  in  2012. Around  62  %  of  the  oral  cancer  cases  arise  in  developing  countries3.

Glynn4, et al. analysed the proportion, quality and  relevance of oncology related articles on all 26 most  common cancer publications published in 2007 and  relate this output to heir associated disease burden.  Shao5,  et  al .  studied  the  world  cancer  research  output,  as  covered  in  30  representative  oncology  journals during 2001 to 2010, using Web of Science database. It identified the primary research centers,  including  the  top  20  institutions  and  countries  and  the  four  major  oncology  research  fronts.  Lewison6 identified  research  output  of  15  leading  countries  in  cancer,  using  three  versions  of  a  filter,  in  2005  and 2009 using Web of Science   database.  It  gave  different indicators of performance of leading countries.  Lopez-Illescas7,  et  al .  analysed  the  robustness  of  country-by-country rankings according to number of  published  articles  and  the  average  citation  impact  in the field of oncology, using both Web of Science and Scopus   databases.  
Ugolini  &  Mela8   evaluated  European  Union  (EU)  research  output  in  oncology  journals  from  1996-2000  and  compared  it  with  USA  and  the  world  &  research  trends  are  highlighted  through  the keywords. Lopez-Illescas9, et al .  evaluated  the  performance  of  European  countries  in  oncology  during  2000-06  and  identified  the  most  important  journals and academic institutions during 2000-2006,  using  Web  of  Science .  Chitra10,  et  al .  examined  and  compare  the  growth  rate,  collaboration  and  publication  activity  in  cancer  research  in  G7  and  BRIC countries, using two relative indicators, using  Scopus  database,  2003-12 
Ortiz11, et al . examined cancer research output  in  Puerto  Rico  and  its  relationship  with  cancer  mortality. Lewison & Markusova12  evaluated cancer  research  output  in  Russia,  with  a  view  to  explore  whether there is enough cancer research and does it  reflect the health needs of the country and how does  its  research  quality  compare  with  world  standard.  Lewison13, et  al .  investigated  changes  in  research  activity  (total  output),  relative  commitment  and  collaborations  between  countries/regions  (UK  with  
other  countries)  with  similar  healthcare,  population  and  development  parameters  to  assess  the  utility  of  this  policy  research  approach  and  the  impact  of  changes  on  research  publications  as  a  surrogate  for  overall  research  activity 
ho14, et  al .  analysed  research  performance  of  individuals,  institutes  and  collaborating  countries  with  Japan  in  lung  cancer  research.  Glynn15,  et  al.  analysed  180126  research  papers  appearing  in  4096 journals from 155  countries in breast cancer  from  1945-2008.  Dursun16,  et  al.  identified  top  ranking  countries,  institutions  and  authors  in  three  gynecological journals, as well as degree of Turkish  contribution during 2000-07. Klar17, et al. evaluated  the  quantity  (6119  papers)  and  quality  of  research  output  in  gynecological  oncology  during  1996- 2006.  Research  productions  of  different  countries  are  compared  with  national  population  and  gross  domestic  product.  
Ugolini18, et al. examined 3842 papers from 92  journals in cancer epidemiology among countries during  1995-2004  and  compared  number  of  publications  and  the  impact  factor  with  country  population  and  gross domestic product.  Moghimi19, et al. analysed  3259  articles  (receiving  14894  citations)  in  breast  reconstruction  surgery  published  since  1990  and  focused on subject analysis, geographical distribution,  leading  institutions  and  authors  and  highly  cited  papers. 
There  is  no  research  paper  based  quantitative  analysis of mouth cancer literature both at national  and  international  level.  As  a  result,  the  present  study  was  undertaken  on  the  global  publication  output  in  mouth  cancer. 
3.    ObJeCtIves 
The  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  analyse  the  global  research  output  in  mouth  cancer  during  2003-12,  with  a  view  to  study:  
(i)  World  research  output,  its  growth,  rank  and  
global  publications  share  and  citation  impact  
of  top  15  countries  
(ii)  Output and impact by different sub-fields, different  
types of research, site origin, treatment methods  
and  by  different  population  age  groups;  and  (iii)  Publications  productivity  and  impact  of  20  
leading  institutions. 
4.    MetHODOLOGY AND sOURCe   OF  DA tA 
  The  world  and  15  most  productive  countries  publications  in  mouth  cancer  were    extracted  and  downloaded  from  Scopus  International  Database20 for 10 years (2003-12). For identifying literature on  mouth  cancer,  a  set  of  keywords  were  identified  and  the  following  search  strategy  (main  strategy)  was  used  to  search  and  download  data  resulting

For  output  on  India  and  other  countries,  the  main  search  strategy  was  limited  to  country  tag  and  period  tag  from  2003-12.  The  type  of  cancer,  cancer  site  and  research  type  was  identified  with  a  set  of  keywords,  which  were  later  converted  into  three  separate  search  strategies.  Each  individual  search strategy was combined with the main strategy  to  generate  the  desired  publication  output.  Mouth  cancer research output was classified according to  population age groups based on keywords, such as  child,  adolescents,  adults,  middle  aged  and  aged  80  &  over:    For  analysing  papers  by  sub-fields,  classification  as  provided  in  Scopus  database  has  been  used.  For  analysing  significant  institutions,  separate search strategy was developed, which later  combined  with  the  main  search  strategy  leading  to  the  generation  of  the  desired  output.  For  citations  data,  three  years,  two  years  and  one  year  citation  window  has  been  used  for  computing  average  citations per paper in mouth cancer research during  2003-10,  2011  and  2012  
The study uses a number of indicators, absolute  and  relative. They  include  the  raw  count  of  papers  and  citations,  number  of  international  collaborative  papers,  average  citation  per  paper,  activity  index  and  relative  citation  impact.  Citation  per  paper  is  measured  by  the  ratio  of  total  number  of  citations  and the total number of papers for a country or an  institution.    Relative  citation  index  (RCI)  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  country’s  share  of  world  citations  and  country’s  share  of  world  publications.  The  activity  index  is  defined  as  a  country’s  share  of  its  total  article  output  across  subject  field(s)  relative  to  the  global  share  of  articles  in  the  same  subject  field(s).
