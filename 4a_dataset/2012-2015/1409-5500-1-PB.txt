ABSTRACT
This study focuses on the identification of web presence and their links among SAARC countries. The
research explores that India possesses maximum of 14, 10, 00, 000 webpages; 58, 20, 000 external links;
1, 18, 00,000 internal links; and 9, 83, 00,000 over all links. In case of web impact factor of external and
internal links, Sri Lanka claims highest and for over all links once again India claims highest. One can note
that, except India no SAARC country possesses all sub-domains, but these possess only a few sub-domains
like .edu, .gov, .net, and .org. When analysis of the links was done, it was found that Pakistan has a maximum
of 3,610 links to India as compared to other SAARC countries. India once again claims top position among
the SAARC countries for Wiser ranking.
Keywords: Web presence, link analysis, webometric analysis, SAARC countries

1. INTRODUCTION
Despite the traditional information systems such as
libraries, which categorise their information resources
based on special criteria, the webpage is receptive for
each kind of information from individuals and institutions.
In other words, there is a no structural control on the data
entering to webpage. Therefore, to find relevant and high
quality information, in the easiest and fastest possible
way, is a serious challenge for web user. The webpage is
full of information and services including social/
economical/science and technology information each of
which has its own users.
Webometric covers research of all network-based
communication using infometric or other quantitative
measure. Webometrics, in future, may become one of
the most interesting research area for the vast collection
of electronic information available on the publicly
indexable web. Paisley rightly identified this area as the
future domain of bibliometric research. So an attempt has
been made to analyse the web presence and their links of
SAARC countries with different parameters.

2. SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY
Due to time limit, the study is focused to analyse the
webpages and their links that are accessible from
70

SAARC countries like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. The
advanced search facility of AltaVista and scholar-google
was used to collect the primary data. Data collection was
conducted to retrieve the links as well as the web
presence of SAARC countries. The limitation of the study
was that, instead of collecting the primary data with
different search engines, we used only one search
engine-Alta Vista was used.

3. LITERATURE REVIEW
Before conducting this study a literature review was
done to bridge the gap between the research all ready and
yet to be done.
Thomas & Willett1 made a webometric analysis for the
departments of library and information science (LIS) in UK
universities. The findings indicate that it is not possible to
identify any significant correlation between the citation
data and peer evaluations of research excellence
embodied in the research assessment exercise (RAE)
rankings.
Thelwall2, et al. made a webometric study of the
universities of 16 European countries to know academic
interlinking. It is found that universities’ websites were
tended to link mostly to countries geographically nearer.
Received on 28 January 2011; Revised on 03 October 2011

Similar patterns may also appear within a single country
such as the UK3 and Canada4,5.

To identify the web pages, inlinks, self links and total
links, Ingwersen9 has given the following formula:

Mukhopadhyay6 made webometric investigation at
different levels of domain name system based on the
hyperlink analysis. Various web impact factor (WIFs)
were calculated for cc to p-level domain (TLDs) of SAARC
countries; sub-level domains (SLDs) related to academic
and research institutes and hosts under Indian Institute of
Technology and Indian Institute of Management
educational system in India.

Aguillo7, et al. made an analysis of web presence of
the universities in Latin America using cybermetrics
indicators. The authors have studies the Brazilian
universities to know the web presence through web
visibility and domain size. The result shows that there is a
tremendous increase in the commitment of the Brazilian
universities to the web and tried to visualise the web
presence using the co-link maps of 167 Brazilian
universities.

To identify the generic TLD that are linked to Indian
domains, the search expression is:

Jalal8, et al. made a comparison among different types
of ranking approaches for Southern Region universities
having valid NAAC score. It is found that there is a high
correlation between NAAC ranking and WISER ranking.

4. OBJECTIVES
The motive beyond this research was to identify the
top SAARC countries with impact in the web environment,
and to identify some of the variables that might correlate
to the web impact factor of these SAARC countries. In
particular, the study tries to know the following objectives:
(a) To find top and sub level web domains possessed by
SAARC countries websites
(b) To find external links, internal links and over all links
of SAARC countries on the web.
(c) To find generic top level domains that are linked to
and from Indian domains
(d) To find SAARC countries that are linked to and from
Indian domains
(e) Ranking of SAARC countries based on web impact
factor
(f) Ranking of SAARC countries based on WISER law.

5. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The research followed the descriptive approach. The
research method used in this study is survey method. In
order to collect data, the list of SAARC countries provided
by Wikipedia was used. Before using the list, we have
checked the access of each SAARC countries website.
The advanced search facility of AltaVista was used for
data collection. Search expressions are as follows:
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

linkdomain:in AND domain:generic TLD
To identify generic TLD that are linked from Indian
domains, the search expression is:
linkdomain:generic TLD AND domain:in
Web Impact Factor
The WIF provides quantitative tools for ranking,
evaluating, categorising, and comparing websites of top/
sub-level domains. To identify the WIF, Ingwersen9 has
given the following formula:
WIF for total external=Total external links divided by total
pages
WIF for total self links=Total self links divided by total
pages
WIF for total links =Total links divided by total pages
WISER Ranking
Aguillo10, et al. has given the formula for WISER
ranking as:
WISER ranking = Log (Visibility 50 %) + Log (Size 20 %)
+ Log (Rich files 15 %) + Log (Scholar 15 %)

6. ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
6.1 Top Level Domains and Webpages of
SAARC Countries
A TLD is one of the domains at the highest level in the
hierarchical domain name system of the internet.
Originally, the TLD space was organised into three main
groups-countries, categories, and multiorganisations.
Countries are designated in the domain name system by
their two-letter ISO country code.
The TLD of SAARC countries are reflected in Table 1.
Regarding webpages, India possesses maximum of
14,10,00,000 webpages followed by Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
and Maldives.
71

The SLDs possessed by SAARC countries is shown
in Table 2. It reflects that the SLD like .edu, .gov and .org
is possessed by all SAARC countries.

The SAARC countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan,
Maldives, and Bhutan possess four SLDs Nepal and
Afghanistan possess five SLDs and Bangladesh
possesses six SLDs. Another interesting note is that,
India possesses all SLDs shown in the Table 2.

6.3 Links or Hyperlinks
Hyperlink (or link) is a reference to a document that
the reader can directly follow, or that is followed
automatically. Hyperlinking means to create an internal or
an external link. External link means, the links that are
linked from outside domain, internal links means, the
links that are linked with in the same domain.

6.2 Sub-level Domains and Webpages of
SAARC Countries
An SLD is a domain that is part of a larger domain. A
sub-domain expresses relative dependence, not
absolute dependence. Organisations should register the
domain name within the appropriate SLDs that
corresponds to the type of the organisation/entity as
outlined:
.co

For registered companies/trademarks/banks

.firm

For proprietary concerns/partnership firms/
shops/liaison offices

.ac

For academic community

.edu

For academic community

.res

For research institutes

.gov

For government organisations

.mil

For military establishments

.net

For internet service providers

.org

For non-profit organisations

.ind

For individuals

.gen

For general/miscellaneous purpose

Table 3 shows that India possesses highest of
1,18,00,000 internal links; 58, 20, 000 external links; and
9,83,00,000 over all links followed by Pakistan 49,10,000
over all links and Sri Lanka 16,60,000 over all links.
Table 4 illustrates the SAARC countries which are linked
to Indian domain. India got maximum links from Pakistan
(3,610) followed by Sri Lanka (2,070) and Nepal (728).
Table 5 shows Pakistan occupies first position to get
a maximum of 18, 300 links from India, when compared to
other SAARC countries. The next position goes to Sri
Lanka 5,100 links followed by Maldives 2,520 links and
Nepal 1740 links.

6.4 Generic Top-level Domains
A generic TLD is one of the categories of TLDs
maintained by the internet assigned numbers authority
(IANA) for use in the domain name system of the internet.
The core group of generic TLDs consists of .co, .ac, .edu,
.gov, .mil, .net, .org, .info, .com, and others.

Table 6 shows that .com possess first position
(3,62,00,000 links) among the other generic TLD of the
SAARC countries which are linked to Indian domain. The
next position goes to .net (17, 00,000) followed by .org
(14, 70,000) and .info (1, 75,000). But India is failing to
get the link from the generic TLD like of SAARC countries.
From Table 6 and 7, some similarities can be seen. The
generic TLDs like .com once again got the first position
(7,790 links) among the other generic TLDs SAARC
countries which majority of Indian links are linked to .com.
Even .net (3,660 links) gets second position among others
which majority of Indian links is linked to .net followed by
.org (3,300 links), .info (872 links), and .edu (154 links).

6.5 Web Impact Factor
A WIF is a fairly innovative measure of the extent to
which a webpage is linked to by other webpages. The
WIF is a form of measurement used to determine the
relative standing of webpages in particular fields or a
country. Here higher the impact factor, the higher the
perceived reputation of the webpage.
The WIF of external links possessed by SAARC
countries is shown in the Table 8. Here, Sri Lanka
occupies first position with 0.06495 impact factor followed
by Pakistan (0.06305) and Bhutan (0.04387), It may be
noted that, even though India possesses maximum

number of webpages and external links, India fail to get
more WIF for its external links.

The WIF for over all links is shown in the Table 10.
India possesses first position by possessing highest WIF
of overall links (0.6971) among SAARC countries. Nepal
and Afghanistan got third and fourth position, respectively,
by possessing 0.4677 and 0.446 WIF for over all links.
After verification of WIF of external link, internal
link, and over all link,some very different results were
found. Sri Lanka and Pakistan got first and second
position, respectively, in WIF of internal and external
links, but they failed to retain the same positions in
WIF for over all links. Similarly, India and Nepal failed
to get any top three position in the WIF of external and
internal links, but they retained the first and second
position in WIF of over all links.

An attempt has been made to rank the webpages and
the links of SAARC countries using appropriate
webometric indicators. The details of the indicators is
already explained in the choice of indicator, in addition to
this WISER ranking which was used explained in the
research methodology.
WISER rank of by SAARC countries is shown in the
Table 11. Here, India occupied highest rank followed by
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Table 12 shows the rich files.

7. FINDINGS


The TLDs of SAARC countries are reflected in
Table 1. Regarding webpages, India possess highest
(14,10,00,000) webpages followed by Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, and Maldives.



The SAARC countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan,
Maldives, and Bhutan possess four SLDs, Nepal and
Afghanistan possess five SLDs and Bangladesh
possess six SLDs.



India possessed maximum of 1,18,00,000 internal
links, 58, 20, 000 external links, and 9,83,00,000 over
all links followed by Pakistan 49,10,000 over all links
and Sri Lanka 16,60,000 over all links.



India got maximum links from Pakistan (3,610)
followed by Sri Lanka (2,070) and Nepal (728).



Pakistan occupies first position to get a maxmimum
of 18, 300 links from India, when compared to other
SAARC countires.



.com possesses first position (3,62,00,000 links)
among the other generic TLDs of the SAARC
countries which are linked to Indian domain.







Some similarities can be seen: the generic TLDs like
.com got the first position (7,790 links) among the
other generic TLDs SAARC countries which majority
of Indian links are linked to .com. Even .net (3,660
links) gets second position among others which
majority of Indian links is linked to .net followed by
.org (3,300 links), .info (872 links) and .edu (154
links).
Sri Lanka occupies first position with 0.06495 WIF for
external links followed by Pakistan (0.06305) and
Bhutan (0.04387). It is to be noted that, even though
India possess maximum number of web pages and
external links, India fail to get more WIF for its
external links.
Sri Lanka and Pakistan has succeeded to get first
and second position, respectively, for the WIF of
internal links.

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)



For WIF for over all links, India succeeded to get first
position in the WIF of overall links (0.6971) among
SAARC countries.



Sri Lanka and Pakistan got first and second position,
respectively, in WIF of internal and external links, but
they fail to retain the same positions in WIF for over all
links. Similarly, India and Nepal could not get any top
three position in the WIF of external and internal links,
but they retained the first and second position in WIF
of over all links.



India possessed first position as per the WISER rank
for SAARC websites.

8. CONCLUSIONS
It would be practical to do study comparing more
countries and evaluating web with traditional publication
productivity and indicators of fiscal and technical
development. Web presence and links analysis of
countries is promising in general terms, but in practice
the web presence and links are not entirely equivalent to
citations in the scholarly publications.
By keeping this study as a webometric analysis of
web presence and their links of sub-domains like .ac,
.edu, and .res possessed by SAARC countries can be
done.
