  T his  paper  highlights  on  the  R&D  information  needs  of  scientists,  engineers,  managers  and  researchers in the feld of metallurgy working in selective metallurgical institutions in Jharkhand, India.  The  study  revealed  that  the  R&D  groups  of  these  organisations  used  a  variety  of  formal  and  informal  information sources effectively in meeting their research information needs. Apart from literature search,  the  teams  attend  meetings,  discussions,  seminars,  workshops  and  conferences  as  the  major  informal  sources of acquiring knowledge, sharing experiences with their colleagues and experts and to establish  professional  contacts  for  exchange  of  knowledge.  Government-funded  organisations  have  a  provision  of regular budget to support their knowledge resources whereas public funded organisations are mostly  project-based funding and fuctuates from time to time as also in the case of privately funded, which are  mostly need-based. Similar is the case for document procurement services and knowledge sharing in all  
the three kinds of metallurgical organisations.

1.  r INt ODUctION 
Jharkhand  is  well  known  for  its  rich  mineral  resources. The State is the sole producer of cooking  coal (32 % of India's annual production), iron, copper  (25 % of India's annual production), uranium, mica,  bauxite,  pyrite  etc.  Jharkhand  is  equipped  with  a  good number of educational and technical institutions  like,  12  Polytechnic  institutes  and  ITIs  as  well  as  institutions of repute such as Xavier Labour Relations  Institute  (XLRI),  Xavier  Institute  of  Social  Service  (XISS),  Indian  School  of  Mines  (ISM),  National  Institutes  of  Technology  (NIT),  Birsa  Institute  of  Technology (BIT) Sindri, Birla Institute of Technology  (BIT) Mesra, Indo Danish Tool Room (IDTR), Central  Mine  Planning  and  Design  Institute  (CMPDI),  RVS  College  of  Engineering  and  Technology,  Mahatma  Gandhi Memorial Medical College and many more1.  There are also number of government-, public- and  private-funded R&D organisations/industries working  in  the  area  of  iron  and  steel,  coal  and  economic  
their R&D centre along with library and information  
and  their  judicious  management.  However,  a  very  little  is  known  about  the  extent  of  their  utilisation  through  the  published  data.  
An  user  is  the  key  person  in  any  scientific  information system and he needs precise and specific  information  concerning  his  field  of  activity.  On  the  other  hand  library  budgets  are  insufficient  in  real  terms due to ever escalation in cost of publications  resulting  in  reduced  acquisitions  of  publications.  Thereby,  the  extent  of  inter-library  loan  (ILL)  and  enrollment  of  institutional  membership  is  gaining  the  ground.  However,  all  these  aspects  depend  significantly  on  organisational  policies  and  inter- personal  relations.  Therefore,  the  modern  concept  like  e-enabled  resource  sharing,  consortium,  web- based  online  public  access  catalogue  (OPAC)  are  emerging  and  becoming  popular  among  the  library  professionals. The library professionals are required  to  be  technically  sound  to  handle  all  the  modern  tools  and  techniques  for  better  understanding  and

materials  science  in  Jharkhand,  to  support  their  researcher  for  better  productivity.  Therefore,  the  present  study  encompasses  the  R&D  information  need of selective metallurgical organisations and to  explore the information seeking behaviour among three  types  (i.e.,  govt.-,  public-  and  private-organisation)  of  library  users  working  in  R&D  institutions  and  industries located in Jharkhand, namely, CSIR-National  Metallurgical Laboratory (NML), CSIR-Central Institute  of Mining & Fuel Research (CIMFR) (Government- funded);  Steel  Authority  of  India  Ltd.  (SAIL),  and  MECON  Ltd.  (Public-funded);  and  Tata  steel  Ltd.  and  Usha  Martin  Ltd.  (Private-funded). 
2. LItErAtUrE  rEVIEW 
Studies have been carried out to document the  research  needs  of  the  users  in  R&D  organisations  and  industrial  library  &  information  centres.  Some  earlier work has been done in Singapore, Australia,  uSA  and uK  also  in  India  (Bhavnagar,  Bangalore,  Jamshedpur, Lucknow, Bhubaneswar and Delhi). The  studies are based on user-interaction with libraries in  general. Engineers and scientists are fundamentally  different  in  terms  of  how  they  approach  their  jobs,  the type and amount of supervision they require, the  type of recognition they desire, and their personality  traits2.  Garvey  &  Griffith3   stated  that  the  type  of  information  desired  by  scientists  varies  from  stage  to stage of their scientific research. The information  produced  by  them  is  published  in  the  form  of  conference  paper,  research  articles,  and  as  R&D  reports. The  scientists  and  researchers  mostly  use  the  information  systems  at  their  disposal  to  carry  out  their  investigations4.  The  information  seeking  behaviour is mainly concerned with who needs what  kind of information, for what reasons, and how their  needs  can  be  identified  and  satisfied5.  
The relationship between scientists' information- seeking behaviors and their personal/environmental  factors  has  been  studied  by  Niu  &  Hemminger6.  Most of the information scientists collect procedural  information  for  a  design  or  development  of  the  
global happenings in their respective field of work12.  However,  there  are  almost  no  reports  about  the  functioning types of specialised libraries in Jharkhand  although their performances excel over many other  similar  organisations  across  the  country. 
3. ObJEct IVES 
The present work focuses on the studies relating  to the understanding of six metallurgical R&D Libraries  & Information Centres (RDLICs), namely, (1) CSIR- NML, (2) CSIR-CIMFR, (3) SAIL-RDCIS, (4) MECON,  (5) TATA Steel and (6) usha Martin, and their user's  information  seeking  behaviour.  
In all these R&D LICs, the following objectives were  undertaken to facilitate and organise the information  resources  &  services  to  support  the  respective  managerial,  research  and  technical  groups: 
(a)  To examine the infrastructure available in RDLIC for  
meeting  the  ever  growing  demands  of  users  (b) To ascertain the purposes of their visit and use  
of  information  resources  
(c) To  study  the  frequency  of  their  visits  to  
RDLICs  
(d)  To  examine  RDLICs  user  views  regarding  the  
availability of print and online resources and to  
find  out  the  extent  of  use  of  these  resources  (e)  To explore the information needs of the RDLIC  
users  and  to  have  the  feedback,  and  
(f)  Preferences in publishing their research output  
(by  the  R&D  users)  and  to  find  out  the  most  
commonly  used  search  engines. 
4. MEtHODOLOGY 
The  survey  method  and  questionnaire  tool  has  been  used  for  data  collection.  A  well  structured  questionnaire  was  designed  for  collection  of  data  and methodology following the two studies adopted  after  Das13   and  Ramesh

information gathering7. The scientists preferred using  primary  sources  of  information,  particularly  journal  and review articles8.Most of the researchers visit to  their library weekly, to collect reading materials and  using  the  OPAC  as  a  preferred  tool  for  searching  the  required  materials9.  The  subscribed  electronic  resources are highly preferred to the R&D users of  the  specialised  library  as  evident  by  the  resultant  productivity in terms of qualitative research publications  compare to earlier trends10. There is a growing use  of  e-journals  over  print  journals,  however,  which  is  the  preferable  over  the  other  is  a  debatable  issue11.  The  impact  of  internet  and  the  availability  of  high-speed  networks  has  enabled  the  library  users  to  have  access  and  also  keep  track  of  the

total  1371  questionnaires  distributed  to  scientists,  engineers, managers, researchers, etc., 1101 were  received with an overall response rate of 80.31 %.  The  data  were  analysed  using  MS-Excel  2007  software  and  suitable  graphical  representations  were  made  to  depict  the  findings.  In  addition  to  questionnaire,  an  interview  schedule  and  on  spot  study  were  also  undertaken  mainly  to  collect  data  about  the  use  of  internet,  open  access,  social  networking, institutional repositories, online services,  and CD-ROM services offered by these government-,  public- and private-funded libraries and information  centres under reference for their data analysis and  interpretations.

DAtA ANALYSIS 
5.1 Sector-wise  Distribution  of  responses  
A  detailed  survey  was  undertaken  in  all  the  metallurgical  RDLICs  and  collected  the  data  from  the  library  users  who  visit  regularly  contributing  to  organisational output.  The highest (90 %) responses  received from CSIR-NML, whereas usha Martin had  the lowest representation (62.75 %). The responses  received in all other the cases, namely, CSIR-CIMFR,  SAIL-RDCIS, MECON and Tata Steel were 89.30%,  79.94  %,  70.34  %  and  79.53  %,  respectively.   The  average  core  user  respondents  of  government- funded  RDLICs  under  the  study  (CSIR-NML  &  CSIR-CIMFR)  was  89.79  %.  The  average  core  user respondent of public supported RDLICs (SAIL- RDCIS & MECON) was 75.14 %. The average core  respondent  of  Private-funded  (Tata  Steel  &  Usha  Martin)  was  71.14  %  Therefore,  the  responses  received  depict  the  promptness  and  user-library  service beneficiaries orientation as exhibited among  the  organisations  under  study  in  decreasing  order:   CSIR-NML  >  CSIR-CIMFR  >  SAIL-RDCIS  >  TATA  Steel  >  MECON  > usha  Martin. 
5.2 Designation-wise  Distribution 
In  the  present  study,  all  the  ranks  of  the  
analysis  of  the  study  shows  that  middle  and  junior  management  (62.67%)  are  the  major  users  of  library information in all the organisations. However,  junior  temporary  staffs  (28.59%)  are  the  major  users  in  the  government-funded  R&D  laboratories  compared  to  those  in  public  (11.25%)  and  private  (14.44%)  organisations. A  graphical  representation  of  designation-wise  distribution  of  respondents  of  all  the  three  sectors  is  shown  in  Fig.  1. 
5.3 Nature  of Activity  Involved 
It  is  ascertained  from  the  study  that  the  respondents  of  private,  public  and  government- funded  organisations  are  mainly  engaged  in  five  categories  of  activities  within  each  sector,  namely,  applied research/product development, basic research,  technical  services,  consultancy  services  and  S&T  management.  The  respondents  engaged  in  such  works  are  always  in  need  of  information  for  their  day-to-day activities. From all these data, half (50%)  of  respondents  were  engaged  in  applied  type  of  research and development except in MECON having  least involvement. However, majority of respondents  from MECON were involved in Consultancy services  compared  to  others.  Consultancy  agenda  were  not  found in Tata Steel's RD&SS division and also in usha  
organisations under study were grouped, depending

5.4 Ict   Infrastructure  Availablility  
The  level  of  ICT  infrastructure  available  and  functioning  of  the  six  metallurgical  RDLICs  under  study  is  shown  in  Table  1.  Users  were  asked  to  indicate  the  impact  of  ICT  on  their  information  seeking  area.  The  use  of  IT  in  the  present  library  environment  has  been  able  to  improve  the  overall  library  management  activities  and  able  to  enhance  the  library  services,  both  qualitatively  as  well  as  quantitatively.  Virtually  all  users  were  aware  of  its  impact  and  found  it  beneficial  to  their  assignments  as per the data received. Study on R&D publication  growth,  its  impact  and  core  research  areas  with  reference  to  CSIR-NML  revealed  that  the  R&D  contributions made by scientist had a global impact  in  the  field  of  metallurgical  engineering15. 5.5 Purpose  of  Visit  to  Library  &  Information  
centre 
The  users  visit  to  their  library  with  certain  purpose  in  mind.  The  respondents  were  asked  to  state  their  purpose  of  library  visit.  The  responses  received for the purpose of information seeking and  visiting  their  library  were  tabulated  and  presented  in  Table  2.  A  set  of  ten  parameters  were  chalked

out from the filled-in responses for which the users  visit  library  and  information  centres.  
The  respondents  were  asked  to  rate  these  responses  on  four-point  scale,  namely,  Always  =  3,  Frequently  =  2,  Rarely  =  1,  and  Never  =  0. The  purpose  of  users  visit  to  the  library  gives  input  to  develop  a  need-based  collection  to  the  librarian  and  also  develop  other  services  and  facilities  to  serve  the  users  in  a  better  way.  It  is  evident  from  the  table  that  the  overall  responses  showed  that  majority  of  respondents  frequently  consult  their  library  and  information  centre  to  fulfill  their  ongoing  projects’  information  needs  for  research/  development/design with a weighted mean (WM) of  2.21  ranking  first  and  to  keep  themselves  up-to- date  through  scanning  latest  arrivals/periodicals  in  the  related  fields  (WM=2.13),  thus  ranking  second  requirement. Further, most of the scientist, engineers,  managers  and  research  scholars  found  to  prefer  subject  specific  information  through  use  of  current  periodicals  to  keep  them  update  in  the  knowledge  of  their  field  of  interest.  It  is  noted  that  there  is  a  significant  use  of  library,  mainly  for  research  purposes  and  it  is  quite  natural  that  respondents  have  given  top  priority  for  this  purpose.

5.6 Use  of It-based  Information  Materials 
On  the  basis  of  the  overall  analysis,  it  was  found that all level of respondents from metallurgical  organisations  clearly  preferred  using  internet  for  e-mail  services  with  a  weighted  mean  of  2.97  to  fulfill their information needs (Table 3), followed by  online bibliographic database (2.57), e-journal (2.30),  online catalogue (2.24) and standard/patent (2.15),  thus ranking first to fifth in the order of preferences.  On  the  other  hand,  the  overall  responses  showed  that  there  were  the  least  demand  of  the  following  electronic information sources like– e-books (1.68),  CD-ROMs  databases  (1.65),  electronic  bulletin  board  (1.07)  and  online  thesis/dissertation  (0.78)  in  some  of  the  RDLICs  under  the  study. The  study  also revealed that most of the problem solving and  decision  making  was  cleared  through  the  use  of  the IT-based information sources and services. The  respondents  from  the  metallurgical  organisations  are  using  e-mail  as  a  cheaper  source  for  online  document  delivery  system  and  a  better  preference  than the postal service in terms of speedy delivery.  Therefore, the IT-based information resources have  changed the information seeking and dissemination  patterns  among  the  users.

5.7 Use  of Informal  Sources 
The  respondents  were  asked  as  to  why  they  attend conferences, workshops and meetings. This  was examined to find out any significant difference  among  the  government,  public  and  private-funded  organisation. The overall result obtained are presented  in  Table  4  which  shows  that  a  large  number  of  respondents  with  a  highest  weighted  mean  of  2.55  from  all  the  three  spheres  have  indicated  that  such  programme  are  very  beneficial  as  one  can  gain  knowledge  from  listening  to  presentations  and  discussions.  Further,  one  can  also  develop  professional  contacts  and  relationships  through  this  forum.  The  second  preference  of  respondents  was  group  discussion  with  weighted  mean  of  2.07,  followed by training orientation (1.83). The scientific  and  technical  communities  of  these  organisations  attend seminars, conferences and workshops to update  their knowledge and to gain more by discussion with  the colleagues participated in the programme. Some  of  the  respondents  underwent  for  training  to  learn  more to perform better in their field. The maximum  respondents from R&D like– Tata Steel, NML, CIMFR  and  RDCIS  take  the  benefits  of  presenting  their  research  output  among  their  subjects  specialist  and  also  taking  the  research  materials  of  their  colleagues  in  the  form  of  conference  proceedings,

5.8 Extent  of  Use  of  Information  Services  &  
Facilities 
Information centre is a service-oriented institute. It  fulfills information needs of the users and contributes  for the enhancement of their knowledge. A question  was asked to know the usefulness and effectiveness  of  information  services  and  facilities  render  to  their  users.  The  users  of  government,  public  and  private-funded rated their responses on a four-point  scale, namely, always, frequently, rarely, and never  used.  The  weighted  mean  of  their  responses  was  calculated and shown in Table 5. As per this study  is  concerned,  online  bibliographic  databases  was  one  of  the  most  useful  tools  and  had  a  weighted  mean  of  2.70,  followed  by  reprography  services  (2.66),  then  reference/information  services  with  the  weighted  mean  of  2.27.  The  in-house  library  catalogue (OPAC) with a mean score value of 2.16  at  their  desktop  to  search  /  locate  the  document  of  their  requisite,  followed  by  the  print  document  services  (2.09)  offered  the  library.  Further,  it  is  noted that Newspaper clipping services (1.86), CD- ROM  databases  and  products  (1.52),  audio-visual  and  multimedia  collection  (1.05)  were  rarely  used  services, so there is less demand of these information  
services.  Further,  sector-wise  library  analysis  of  data  shows  that  reprography  services  is  also  one  of  the  highly  demanded  services  and  facilities  of  these  sectors  for  xeroxing  the  required  document  and articles except Usha Martin Ltd., their technical  library  is  very  small  in  size  and  collection. 5.9 Preferences  in  Use  of  Web  Search  
Engines 
With the increasing cost of the print publications  majority  of  information  seekers  are  opting  for  e-resources  through  Internet.  The  scientific  and  technical  communities  are  looking  for  free  access  of  downloading  of  articles.  Searching  for  the  right  information  is  a  skill  for  saving  their  time  while  using web-based services. The finding revealed that  Google,  MSN,  and  AltaVista  are  the  most  popular  and  widely  used  search  engines  among  Internet  users  (Fig.  3).  It  was  found  that  69.39  %  of  the  users  search  for  information  using  search  engine  from all spheres. Google is ranked the most favourite  search  engine,  followed  by  specific  publishers'  websites (25.07 %) by accessing it directly through  the site's uRL. This indicates that respondents are  more  familiar  and  comfortable  with  the  web-based  search  facility  and  find  it  more  reliable.  It  is  also  noted  that  22  %  of  respondents  from usha Martin  depend  upon  other  online  sources,  namely,  open  access  databases  and  gateway.

5.10 choice  of reading  Materials 
For  last  few  decades,  digital  conversions  of  information  materials  for  print  have  been  ever  increasing.  Majority  of  respondents’  choices  were  to  accumulate  all  the  required  information  in  one  place  and  then  take  out  a  print  for  reading  them  from  the  newly  created  file  while  searching  on  a  topic  which  was  evidenced  from  Fig.  4.  A  good  number of respondents (56.77 %) preferred to take  the  print  out  of  the  searched  information  materials  and  stored  them  for  ready  reference  and  future  guidance  to  their  project  team  members.  However,  22.80  %  of  respondents  prefer  to  download  the  articles in their computer hard disk either for backup  or  sending  to  their  colleagues  on  demand.  About  18.98  %  of  the  respondents  would  like  to  read  the  information materials on the computer screen itself.  As  observed  from  the  figure  that  there  was  least  representation  of  respondent  (1.45  %)  who  used  other  method  (taking  screenshot  of  the  figures,  photographs,  and  writing  on  CD/DVD,  etc.)  for  retrieving reading materials. It was observed that the  government-funded organisations have a provision for

were  publishing  their  research  output  in  peer- reviewed periodicals/journals having in the category  of SCI   and  high  impact  factor  and  presenting  their  papers  in  the  International  conferences/seminars  organised  by  the  reputed  professional  bodies.  The  overall results showed that 69.52 % of the scientific  & technical respondents preferred for publishing in  international  publications,  followed  by  24.09  %  in  Indian  publications  and  the  rest  (6.39%)  indicated  no such specific preference. It is also revealed from  the  study  that  majority  of  the  respondents  (80%)  from  government-funded  R&D  laboratories  gave  the  reasons  for  publishing  in  foreign  journals,  as  better  coverage  in  online  bibliographic  databases,  like  CSA,   Web  of  Science ,   Scopus ,  etc.,  and  the  timely  publication  are  some  of  the  other  factors  which  influences  the  scientific  community  and  preferred  science  citation  index  journals  having  impact  factor.  It  is  also  noted  that  the  scientists  and  researchers  prefer  to  publish  their  research  findings in publication of high repute to adorn their  resume,  to  stand  out  among  colleagues/peers  and  gain  better  recognition. 
6.   cO NcLUSIONS 
The findings of the present study may be useful

Library and Information Centres (LICs) users and their  required document management. Several important  
gathered  through  S&T  journals  have  high  value  in  their ongoing projects but they stress for the timely  and  accurate  delivery  by  the  service  providers. 5.11  Preferences  for  Publishing  research      
  Output 
It  is  observed  that  majority  of  the  scientific  community from these R&D institutions and industries 
(CSIR-NML  &  CSIR-CIMFR)  has  a  focus  on  the  
points  relating  to  the  access,  use  and  preference  futuristic  demand  of  technology  with  high  science.  
in  publication,  archival  of  rare  document,  access  But private and public-funded industries focus more  
habits  in  information  seeking,  etc.,  with  respect  to  on  recent  cost  effective  technology  which  can  be

to  the  users  of  the  type  of  organisations.  It  has  
been  found  that  the  government-funded  LICs  have
