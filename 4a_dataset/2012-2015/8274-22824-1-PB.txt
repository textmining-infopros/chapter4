This paper aims to examine the user’s awareness and satisfaction level with the available assistive  technology  (AT)  facilities  for  the  people  with  disabilities  in  National  Capital  Region  (NCR)  libraries  of  India. Survey method and questionnaire has been used as the basic tool for data collection along with  personal interviews of the experts. A total of 375 users in all the 15 libraries were selected randomly on  the basis of willingness of the users to participate in the survey with the experience of working in digital  environment. The survey results were tabulated and analysed with descriptive statistics methods using  Excel software and ‘Stata version 11’. People with disabilities have a good to fair understanding of the  AT concepts and products. The users ‘Strongly agree’ towards the need of the AT to work in the digital  environment. The study depicts lack of AT facilities in NCR libraries of India. Majority of users are ‘Not  satisfed’  with  available AT  facilities  and  face  various  barriers  in  the  use  of AT  in  NCR  libraries. This  study will prove useful for the LIS professionals and the research community to provide an insight into  the current status of the AT available in NCR libraries, India. This study is frst to explore the viewpoint  of people with disabilities regarding the ATs available in NCR libraries of India.

1. INTRODUCTION 
There  has  been  an  increasing  recognition  of  abilities  of  persons  with  disabilities  in  India  with  emphasis  on  mainstreaming  them  in  the  society  on  the  basis  of  their  capabilities.  In  this  regard  Government of India has enacted three legislations  for  persons  with  disabilities,  i.e.,  (i)  Persons  with  Disability (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights  and  Full  Participation) Act,  1995  (ii)  National  Trust  for Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy,  Mental Retardation and Multiple Disability Act, 1999.  Ministry  of  Social  Justice  &  Empowerment1   and  (iii)  Rehabilitation  Council  of  India  Act,  1992.  It  is  estimated  that  over  21  million  people  in  India  are  suffering  from  different  types  of  disabilities  which  is  equivalent  to  2.1%  of  the  total  population  of  the  country2. Since, the problem of disability is gaining  more  and  more  importance  all  over  the  world,  the  planners of India very well understand the significance  of  the  problem  and  therefore  various  policies  and  programs  are  framed  by  the  government  for  the  people  with  the  disabilities  in  India.  
The  library  profession  has  long  championed  in  providing  services  and  materials  to  all  its  patrons  equally  which  is  one  of  the  fundamental  beliefs  inherent in this profession3. As, it is already established  fact  that  access  to  information  is  one  of  the  most  important  human  rights  which  allows  the  individual  to  develop  himself/herself  and  participate  actively  within a democratic society, fully exercising his/her  rights  and  duties4.  Thus,  all  citizens  should  have  equality  in  access  to  information  that  will  enable  them  to  be  active  contributors  and  participants  in  the  society.  In  this  modern  digital  age,  assistive  technologies  play  an  important  role  in  the  lives  of  people  with  disabilities  to  provide  them  access  to  the variety of resources and services available in the  libraries as well as on the web. The term ‘Assistive  technology’  in  general  refers  to  the  software  and  hardware  designed  and  developed  to  assist  the  individuals  with  disabilities  which  might  otherwise  prevent  them  from  making  effective  use  of  the  various  ICT  facilities5.  According  to  Brophy  and  Craven6, the computer related aids and  equipments

like  video  magnifiers,  electronic  readers,  optical  character recognition software, magnification software  and  speech  output  systems,  etc.  that  provides  a  solution  for  a  particular  individual  with  disability  to  work in the digital environment are commonly known  as  ‘assistive’  or  ‘adaptive’  technology.  In  simple  words,  “Assistive  technologies  refer  to  products,  devices  or  equipments  that  are  used  to  maintain,  increase  or  improve  the  functional  capabilities  of  people with disabilities” Koulikourdi13. According  to  Goddard15, Assistive technology may be as simple as  a magnifying glass or it can also be sophisticated as  a computer workstation which can be configured by  the  libraries  according  to  the  needs  of  the  specific  user  groups  like  provision  of  speech  recognition  software  for  the  blind  to  control  the  computer  or  enter  the  text  via  their  voices,  the  touch  screen  monitor and an electronic tracking device for those  who  cannot  make  use  of  standard  keyboards.  The  accessible workstation19 provides adjustable worktable  to the users along with an ergonomic keyboard and  a  large  monitor  around  20  inches  or  larger  which  allows  patrons  using  screen-enlarging  software  to  view the displayed text clearly while moving through  the  documents. 
2. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
In  an  earlier  study  of  libraries  in  the  North- West of England, Jeal, et al.  presented the service  provision  to  deaf  and  hard  of  hearing  people  with  the material and technological developments such as  loop  systems,  minicoms  (text  telephones),  building  adaptations,  computer  and  videophone  service  facilities. The study examines the potential of these  technologies in revolutionising the approach of deaf  people  in  acquiring  information.  
In a particular study, hopkins7 focussed on the  various  assistive  devices  available  for  the  people  with  disabilities  that  can  be  applied  to  address  a  variety  of  personal  needs,  like  users  with  hearing  challenges can make use of various assistive listening  devices,  captioning  features  and  text  telephone  (TTY)  or  telecommunication  devices  for  the  deaf  (TDD). users  unable  to  communicate  verbally  can  make use of portable augmentative and alternative  communication (AAC) devices to speak that allows  customized programming to facilitate communication  in  multiple  environments.  Cantor8   provides  the  adaptable  approach  for  the  librarians  planning  the  library  services  provides  an  approach  for  choosing  accessibility aids that puts high-technology devices  into  a  broader  context.  The  study  also  focus  on  the  transportation  services  like  book  pick-up  and  delivery  services  for  people  who  cannot  get  into  the  library  building  is  of  prime  importance  as  such  a service is valuable for people who are terminally  ill  or  whose  mobility  prevents  them  from  using  the  library  facilities. 
Lisiecki9   pointed  that  the  area  of  adaptive  technology  is  growing  rapidly  and  making  various  assistive  software  applications  available  for  the  computer  users  with  the  disabilities  which  differ  and  range  in  functionality  from  simple  to  highly  specialized,  to  meet  the  user’s  needs  like  screen  reading software JAWS (Job Access With Speech),  OMNI  1000  and  OMNI  3000,  etc.  Libraries  should  choose  only  those  technological  solutions  which  are  useful  in  the  library  setting.  
Ethridge10   elaborates  that  large  print  books,  books  on  tape,  books  on  CD,  and  e-books  are  all  additional options for accessing written information  that can meet the needs of the users with low vision.  Assistive  technologies  increase  independence  in  accessing  printed  information  in  libraries  therefore  librarians need to understand how computer-based  and  non-computer-based  assistive  technology  can  assist  individuals  with  disabilities  in  accessing  printed  information.  Several  important  software  programs available for library patrons with blindness  or  visual  impairments  includes  Duxbury  Braille  Translator (DBT), CakeTalking, DocReader, Reading  Bar,  Connect  Outloud,  Kurzweil  1000  Sunrich  and  Green11. It is not possible for any library to plan for  every single patron’s needs and selecting, installing  and  maintaining  one  or  more  of  the  most  popular  assistive  software  programs.  Therefore,  a  study  by  Mchale12   emphasize  on  five  software  options  for  the  libraries  which  can  be  adopted  to  provide  the  services  to  the  blind/vision  impaired  users  which  includes  ‘JAWS  for  Windows’  from  Freedom  Scientific,  ‘Window-Eyes’  screen-reading  program  with  portable  application,  ‘ZoomText’  magnifier/ reader and ‘ZoomText’ keyboard, ‘Dragon Naturally  Speaking’  which  is  a  speech-to-text  engine  that  allows  users  to  dictate  into  Windows-compatible  programs, such as Microsoft Word and Outlook and  last  one  is  ‘Text  Aloud’  which  is  a  Text-to-Speech  (TTS) software. The library staff should also consider  adoption  of  a  long-term  strategy  for  planning  for  user  with  disabilities.  
Koulikourdi13   investigated  the  current  use  of  assistive technologies  in Greek libraries and revealed  the  lack  of AT  in  Greek  libraries  and  depicted  that  the  current  legal  and  regulatory  framework  with  regard to AT is insufficient. Also, Greek libraries are  in  an  early  stage  of  providing  equal  and  effective  services  to  patrons  with  disabilities  and  many  libraries  are  found  totally  unaware  and  unfamiliar  with  concepts  such  as  accessibility  and  assistive  technology  issues.  In  India,  “M.K.  Tata  Memorial  Learning  Centre  for  Visually  Challenged  Students”  has  been  set  up  at  Sir  Dorabji  Tata  Memorial  Library, TISS in 2008 to provide innovative teaching  techniques  and  philosophy  that  continues  to  have  far-reaching effects on the lives of visually-challenged  and  taking  them  to  new  heights  of  independence.

The Centre has acquired latest technologies to assist  visually-impaired readers and presents a successful  case  to  illustrate  how  bests  the  university  library’s  information resources and services could be extended  to  its  disabled  user  community  Koganurmath  and  Chowkimath14. The reviewed studies reveal that the  adaptive technology greatly enhance and improves  the  information  access  for  the  disabled  but  the  selection of appropriate adaptive/assistive technology  for the libraries among the thousands of resources  available  today  is  an  issue  of  great  challenge  for  the  librarians.  Therefore,  librarians  should  make  necessary  considerations  before  adopting  these  technologies into their system by deeply examining  the  available  research  literature  in  the  area  and  gaining  knowledge  through  the  experiences  of  the  other  libraries.

potentially capable of using vision for the planning or  execution of a task with appropriate assistive device),  deaf/hearing impaired (i.e., complete hearing loss/ loss  of  sixty  decibels  or  more  in  the  better  ear  in  the conversational range of frequencies) and people  suffering  from  locomotor  disability  (i.e,  disability  of  the  bones,  joints  or  muscles  leading  to  substantial  restriction  of  the  movement  of  the  limbs). 
The  total  number  of  respondents  surveyed  in  each  of  the  libraries  is  25  (=100%)  constituting  as  a  whole  population  (i.e.,  sample  population)  of  the  individual library. The total number of users surveyed  is  based  on  random  selection  and  categorized  as  faculty  members,  research  scholars,  graduates,  post-graduates, high school/intermediate and primary  school  students  enrolled  in  various  academic  and  vocational  training  courses  in  different  institutions  in  NCR,  Delhi.  The  total  three  sets  of  Likert-type  questionnaires were prepared for the three different  groups  of  the  users  (i.e.,  blind/vision-impaired,  deaf/hearing  impaired  and  locomotor  impaired).  The  help  of  ‘sign  language  Interpreters’  was  taken  to  communicate  with  the  deaf/hearing  impaired  users. 
The present study used survey method for data  collection with the help of questionnaires and personal  interviews  with  the  experts  and  the  users  of  the  NCR  libraries.  The  survey  results  were  tabulated  and  analsed  with  descriptive  statistics  methods  using  Excel  software  and  ‘Stata  version  11’.

ANALYsIs 
5.1 User’s  Awareness  about  Assistive  
Technology 
There are various types of assistive aids/devices  available  today  for  the  people  with  disabilities  that  enable them to work in the modern digital environment.  The use of the assistive technology depends on the  awareness and knowledge of the users thus in this  regard the following Fig. 2, explores the knowledge  of the respondents about the assistive aids/devices  available  today.  The  findings  clearly  shows  that  highest  number  of  users  in  majority  of  libraries,  i.e.,  18  (72%)  in  ADRC,  17(68%)  in  LNSSD,  16  
Note: n=25 (=100%), Representative population from each library Figure 2. User’s awareness about assistive technology. 
(64%)  in  AIFD,  14(56%)  in  RNBTBL,  13(52  %)  in  DRL,  12(48%)  in  NDS,  10(40  %)  in  CSL,  9(36  %)  each  in  DDCL  and  CRL  and  8(32%)  each  in  DRL  and  ZhL,  respectively.  Further  the  findings  shows  that  majority  of  users,  i.e,  15(60  %)  in hKu,  11(44  %)  each  in  BL  and AIDDS  and  7(28  %)  in  MIPSL  have a good understanding of the AT concepts and  products.  Also,  few  respondents  in  ZhL  (5;  20%),  DRL (3; 12%), BL (2; 8%), MIPSL (2; 8%) and only  1(4%)  user  each  in  DDCL,  hKu,  DRL  and  NDS,  respectively,  classified  themselves  as  ‘Expert’.  
5.2 User’s  Perspective  Regarding  the  Need  of  
Assistive  Technology  
Computers  in  libraries  are  essential  tools  and  assistive technology is the key to use them for the  people  with  disabilities.  The  AT  involves  a  device  or a computer-based accommodation that helps an  individual with special needs to work and compensate  for a disability and enhancing individual ability15   to  gain  access  to  the  vast  amount  of  resources  and  services  through  internet  which  were  previously  inaccessible  to  them.  Fig.  3,  depicts  that  majority  of  respondents  in  all  the  libraries  except  DRL  and  ZhL,  i.e.,  17(68  %)  in  BL;  16(64  %)  each  in hKu,  RNBTBL  and  AIFD;  15(60%)  each  in  ADRC  and  NDS;  14(56%)  each  in  LNSSD  and  DRL;  12(48%)  in  CRL;  11(44%)  in  DDCL;  and  10(40%)  each  in  AIDDS,  CSL  and  MIPSL,  respectively,  ‘Strongly  agree’  towards  the  need  of  assistive  technologies  by  the  users  with  disabilities  to  use  a  computer.  The  findings  shows  that  majority  of  users  in  DRL  (9;  36%)  and  ZhL  (17;  68%)  ‘Agree’  to  the  need  of  assistive  aids/devices  in  their  lives  to  work  in  the  digital  environment. 
5.3 User’s  Awareness  about  the  Available  
Assistive  Hardware  Facilities  
Libraries dealing with the people with disabilities  need to procure the latest assistive hardware facilities  to  facilitate  access  to  the  information  and  the  necessary  resources  required  by  them.  Table  1

DJLIT,  VOL.  35,  NO.  2, MARCh  2015 
shows the awareness of individual category of users  about assistive equipment/devices in the institution/ library  for  them. 
It  is  observed  from  the  findings  that  among  all  the  libraries  serving  the  blind/vision  impaired  users,  the  maximum  respondents  are  aware  of  the  availability  of  the  ‘Scanner/Reader’  in  their  libraries, i.e., 80% each in ADRC and hKu, 72% in  RNBTBL,  68%  in  BL  and  60%  in  DDCL. The  Voice  Recorder/CD  player  is  another  popular  assistive  device  about  which  majority  of  users  are  aware  in  all the libraries except in hKu  (i.e. 80 % in ADRC,  72  %  in  RNBTBL,  60  %  in  DDCL  and  28%  in  BL,  respectively).  Talking  calculators  and  Magnifying  glasses  are  available  on  payment  basis  in  the  respective libraries. users who require these devices  can  purchase  them  for  their  personal  use  from  the  institution.  Sometimes  Venu  Eye  hospital  use  to  donate the magnifying glasses to the users with low  vision at RNBTBL. The maximum assistive hardware  facilities are available and used by the users in BL  and  RNBTBL.  Also,  Table  1  shows  that  ‘hearing  
aids/Cochlear  implants’  is  the  popular  assistive  device about which majority of deaf/hearing impaired  users  are  aware  in  all  the  libraries,  i.e.,  68%  in  LNSSD,  64%  in  NDS,  60%  in  DRL,  56%  in AIDDS  and 36% in AIFD, respectively. In AIDDS, DRL and  NDS,  44%,  28%  and  20%  users,  respectively,  are  aware  of  the  ‘Closed  captioned  decoders’  in  their  libraries. The above results indicate that among all  the  libraries  only  AIDDS  have  maximum  assistive  hardware  facilities  available  for  the  deaf/hearing  impaired  users.  
Lastly,  it  is  found  that  in  DRL  (18;  72%)  and  MIPSL (15; 60%), maximum respondents are aware  of  the  availability  of  the  ‘Simple/Electric  Wheel  Chairs’  in  their  libraries.  ‘Simple/Electric  wheel  chairs’  and  ‘Adaptive  furniture’  are  two  common  assistive  hardware  facilities  available  in  all  the  libraries except ZhL. Not a single assistive hardware  facility is available in ZhL for the locomotor-impaired  users.  The  maximum  assistive  hardware  facilities  are  available  in  CRL  for  the  locomotor-impaired  followed  by  DRL  and  MIPSL.

5.4 Users’  Awareness  about  Available  
Assistive software 
The assistive software is boon to the people with  disabilities which enables them to use the computers  and  access  the  information  from  the  web  at  their  personal  desk. As  assistive  software  have  become  a  necessity  for  the  users  in  this  technological  age  therefore the Table 2 examines if there are sufficient  assistive softwares facilities available in the libraries  for  the  users  with  disabilities. 
Table  2  shows  that  ‘JAWS’  is  available  and  used  by  majority  of  blind/vision-impaired  users  in  all  the  libraries  (i.e.  by  80  %  users  each  in  ADRC and hKu, 72% in RNBTBL, 68 % in BL and  60  %  in  DDCL,  respectively).  The  second  popular  software  is  ‘SAFA’  about  which  majority  of  users  are  aware  in  ADRC  (20;  80  %),  RNBTBL  (18;  72  %)  and  BL  (17;  68  %).  The  ‘Kurzweil  reader’  is  third  most  preferred  software  among  the  users  in  all  the  libraries,  i.e.,  76  %,  64  %,  52  %,  8%  and  
4 % users in hKu, BL, DDCL, ADRC and RNBTBL  respectively  responded  that  ‘Kurzweil’  is  available  in their library and used by them frequently. Lastly,  the  ‘Zoom  Text  Magnifier/Reader’  is  found  as  the  common  software  available  and  used  by  blind/ vision  impaired  in  all  the  libraries  contributing  to  12  (48  %)  respondents  each  in  BL  and  hKu,  11  (44  %)  in  RNBTBL  and  4  (16  %)  each  in  ADRC  and  DDCL  respectively.  The  maximum  assistive  software  facilities  are  available  in  BL  followed  by  DDCL and RNBTBL. It is found that in hKu; ‘SAFA’  software is installed only on one system. ‘Lekha ’ is  personalised hindi  software  used  in  BL  (university  of  Delhi)  and  ‘Shruti ’  Screen  reader  for  hindi  is  created  by  a  blind  user  at  DDCL,  Blind  Relief  Association  which  is  yet  to  be  launched. 
Further  it  is  examined  that  there  are  very  less  assistive software facilities available for deaf/hearing  impaired users in NCR libraries of India. The majority  of  users  in  all  the  libraries  (i.e.,  72  %  in  AIFD,  60  %  in  NDS,  52%  in  AIDDS  and  20  %  in  DRL,

respectively)  except  LNSSD  are  aware  of  ‘Video  captioning  Software’  followed  by  ‘I-communicator’  in aIFD  (11;  44  %), aIDDS  (9;  36  %)  and  NDS  (7;  28  %).  Not  a  single  assistive  software  facility  is  available  in  LNSSD  for  the  users. 
It is also found that there are negligible amount  of  assistive  software  facilities  available  for  the  locomotor-impaired  users  in  Ncr   libraries.  The  findings  show  that  only  crL  (Jawaharlal  Nehru  University)  has  few  assistive  software  facilities  for  the locomotor impaired users (i.e., Dragon Naturally  Speaking,  Voice  recognition  Software  and  on- Screen  Keyboard).  In cSL,  only  2  (8  %)  users  are  found  aware  of  ‘on-Screen  keyboard’  software  in  the  library. also,  the  results  show  that  there  is  not  a single assistive software facility available in DrL,  mIPSL,  and  ZhL  for  locomotor-impaired  users. 
5.5 Users’  Satisfaction  Level  towards  available  
Assistive  Technologies 
In this age of information technology, people with  disabilities  too  are  aware  of  the  various  assistive  technologies available for them and want to utilise the  benefits of these technologies. The libraries/institution  serving the people with disabilities are responsible in  facilitating the access to these assistive technologies  to them. Figure 4 analyses the satisfaction level of  the users towards the available assistive software/ hardware  facilities  at  their  institution/library  and  clearly depicts that majority of blind/vision-impaired  users  in  all  the  libraries,  i.e.,  in aDrc   (20;  80  %),  hKU  (18;  72  %),  BL  (14;  56  %)  and  DDcL  (12;  48 %) except rNBTBL are ‘Not at all satisfied’ with  the  available assistive  software/hardware  facilities  at  their  institution/library.  In  rNBTBL,  users  (8;  32  %)  are  ‘Satisfied’  with  the  available  assistive  technology  facilities  in  the  library.  
also,  it  is  found  that  many  of  deaf/hearing  impaired  users  in  all  the  libraries  except  DrL  i.e.,  in  LNSSD  (11;  44  %), aIFD  (10;  40  %),  NDS  (36 %) and aIDDS (8; 32 %) are ‘Not satisfied’ with  
Note: n=25 (= 100%), representative  population from each Library

technologies. 
96 
the available assistive technologies at their institution/ library. In DrL, majority of users (9; 36 %) are found  ‘To  somewhat  extent  satisfied’  with  the  available  assistive  technology  facilities  in  the  library. 
Lastly, the majority of locomotor impaired users  in  cSL  (13;  52  %),  crL  (10;  40  %)  and  ZhL  (8;  32 %) are ‘Not satisfied’ with the available assistive  software/hardware facilities at their institution/library.  In  mIPSL  7  (28  %),  responded  that  they  are  ‘To  somewhat extent satisfied’ with the available assistive  Technology facilities in the library. In DrL, 9 users  (36 %) are found ‘Satisfied’ with the available assistive  facilities  for  them  in  the  institution/library.  
When the research question, ‘Whether there are  sufficient assistive technology facilities available in the  institutions/libraries for the people with disabilities?’  is statistically tested, the results of chi-square (χ2) test,  showed  that  people  with  disabilities  were  not  satisfied with the available assistive facilities in the  libraries (as P value=0.000 is < 0.05) because they  were  not  sufficient  to  meet  their  information  needs  and  requirements. 
5.6 Barriers  in  Use  of  Assistive  Technology  
although,  there  are  many  assistive  technology  solutions available today for the people with disabilities  providing  access  to  variety  of  resources  in  the  libraries  but  still  there  are  various  barriers  faced  by  them  in  the  use  of  these  technologies.  In  the  earlier studies. The present study identifies the type  of  barriers  faced  by  users  of  Ncr   libraries  in  the  use  of  assistive  technology  in  the  modern  digital  environment and it is found that ‘lack of sufficient aT  facilities’  is  the  major  barrier  among  the  maximum  users  in  all  the  libraries  except  rNBTBL  (i.e.,  12;  48  %  each  in  aIFD  and  crL,  11;  44  %  each  in  hKU  and  DrL,  10;  40  %  each  in  cSL  and  ZhL,  9;  36  %  each  in aDrc,  BL,  DrL  and  NDS,  8;  32  %  each  in  DDcL  and  LNSSD  and  7;  28  %  each  in  aIDDS  and  mIPSL,  respectively)  that  restricts  the  users  from  utilising  the  benefits  of  technology.  
In hKU,  16  %  users  reported  that  many  books  are marked with pen and pencil which is difficult to  scan for recognising by the scanner as scanners are  very old and not working properly. also, computers  are not updated with latest assistive technology and  ‘SaFa’  software  is  installed  only  on  one  system  in  hKU.  In  ZhL  (40  %)  and  mIPSL  (28  %),  the  maximum  respondents  reported  that  there  is  no  facility  of  ‘special  adjustments  computers’  for  the  users  and  no  ‘large  track  ball  (mouse)’  for  people  with hand difficulties is the common barrier faced by  the users in all the libraries serving the locomotor-  impaired  users  (i.e.,  crL,  cSL,  DrL,  mIPSL  and  ZhL,  respectively).  There  is  not  a  single  assistive  software facility available in DrL, mIPSL, and ZhL  for  the  locomotor-impaired  users.

   allowed for multiple responses 
Figure 5. Various barriers faced in the use of assistive  
technology. 
due to the ‘lack of individual orientation/training  sessions’,  the  majority  of  users  (i.e.,  8;  32  %  in  aiFd,  7;  28  %  in  cSl,  6;  24  %  in  bl,  5;  20  %  each  in  adrc,  lnSSd   and  drl   and  4;  16  %  in  crl   respectively)  in  ncr   libraries  are  not  able  to  use at   effectively  which  is  found  as  second  major  barrier  preventing  the  access  to  the  resources  in  the  electronic  environment.  the  majority  of  users  suggested  that  ‘training  on  effective  use  of  the  assistive  devices  newly  introduced  by  the  library’  should  take  place  periodically  in  the  libraries  to  enhance  their  skills  and  awareness  to  handle  the  latest  technology  and  products. 
the  ‘lack  of  sufficient  ict   infrastructure  and  facilities’  is  also  posing  a  great  barrier  in  the  use  of  at   among  the  many  users  in  hKu   (6;  24  %),  miPSl   (6;  24  %),  ddcl   (5;  20  %),  drl   (4;  16  %)  and aiddS (4; 12 %) respectively. there is only one  computer  equipped  with  screen  reader  and  screen  magnification  software  in  ddcl   for  use  by  users.  it  is  also  observed  that  blind/vision  impaired  users  (i.e.,  8;  32  %  in rnbtbl,  5;  20  %  each  in adrc and  bl,  4;  16  %  in  hKu   and  3;  12  %  in  ddcl)  ‘sometimes’  face  difficulty  in  the  access  of  web  information with the help of assistive technology and  find  that at   like  ‘Screen  readers’  available  today  are  not  completely  compatible  with  the  web.  
‘lack of ict  skills and staff support’ in the use  of assistive technologies was identified as additional  barrier to access in the ncr  libraries.  while disability  awareness is still an essential training for the library  staff  but  now  there  is  need  for  staff  to  know  how  to  use  assistive  technology  which  their  disabled  users  may  require  within  the  library.  
5.7 Role  of  Libraries  to  Overcome  Barriers 
technology opens the door to information access  for  the  people  with  disabilities  and  makes  the  performance of the tasks easier but sometimes itself  acts as a barrier16. thus, in this digital age librarians  
need  to  work  hard  to  cope  up  with  the  changing  technologies  and  need  to  adopt  the  appropriate  assistive  aids/devices  to  meet  the  challenge  of  serving the disabled in the libraries. today, there are  numerous at   facilities  available  for  the  individuals  with  disabilities  so  there  is  a  requirement  of  highly  knowledgeable  and  skilled  staff  to  handle  these  technologies17   in  the  ncr   libraries.  also,  the  lack  of  familiarity  with  electronic  equipment  and  lack  of  support  and  training  in  the  use  of  adaptive  technologies are identified as the major barriers to  accessibility of information6  therefore, the necessary  ict   skills  need  to  be  developed  by  the  libraries  among  the  disabled  users  by  providing  regular  trainings  and  orientation  programmes  including  seminars  and  practical  workshops  on  enabling  technologies.  the  libraries  can  develop  different  training  programmes  for  the  users  with  disabilities  by  identifying  their  varied  information  needs  and  demands on the basis of the type and nature of the  disability they have18. it is often noticed that lack of  assistive technology and training is due to the lack  of funds in the libraries/institutions for the disability  services11. thus,  there  is  need  for  the  librarians  to  review and update their library policies focusing on  people with disabilities with the aim to develop new  plans  of  action  for  addressing  the  disability  issues  that  may  include  the  acquisition  of  sufficient  at facilities  for  the  users,  training  of  staff  as  well  as  users  on  how  to  use  the  assistive  technology  and  inclusion  of  feedback  of  the  potential  users  before  acquiring  any  new  technology  in  the  library.  
technological  advances  have  enabled  people  with  a  wide  range  of  disabilities  to  use  computers  and  the  internet,  but  there  is  need  to  follow  some  standards in this regard19  like the  web accessibility  initiative (wai) guidelines which are considered the  international  standard  for  web  accessibility.  So,  librarians can refer to guidelines established by the  world wide web consortium  (w3c),  a  well-known  sponsor of global web development19 and the standards  setting body of the internet20   to  learn  how  to  make  web  content  easily  accessible  to  the  people  with  disabilities as these guidelines mainly focus on the  accessibility issues related to the content available  through  the  web.  uneSco   and  iFla   have  issued  guidelines  to  provide  equal  library  services  to  all  including  people  with  disabilities.  government  of  india  and university grants commission  have  also  issued  guidelines  in  this  regard.21 
6. CONCLUSIONS AND  SUGGESTIONS 
the  assistive  technology  plays  an  important  role  in  the  lives  of  the  people  with  disabilities  as  it enhances information access and allows the user  to accomplish their tasks in a more refined manner  independently.  the  people  with  disabilities  in  the  ncr   libraries  of  india  ‘Strongly  agree’  towards

DJLIT,  VoL.  35,  No.  2,  march  2015 
the  need  of  the  assistive  technologies  to  work  in  the  digital  environment.  although  there  are  some  useful  aT  facilities  like  JaWS,  SaFa,  Kurzweil  reader  and  Zoom  Text  magnifier/reader  which  are  available  in  all  the  libraries  serving  the  blind/ vision  impaired  users  but  majority  of  users  do  not  find  them  sufficient  and  are  ‘Not  satisfied’  with  the  available assistive  software/hardware  facilities  at  their  institution/library.  also,  majority  of  deaf/ hearing-impaired and locomotor-impaired responded  that  there  is  lack  of  sufficient  assertive  technology  facilities at their institution/library. It is also observed  through  this  study  that  some  Ncr   libraries  are  not  concerned  at  all  regarding  the  needs  of  such  user  group  and  providing  negligence  amount  of  aT  facilities  to  them.  Finally  the  research  study  depicts  that  most  of  the  Ncr   libraries  of  India  are  not  in  a  position  to  serve  the  information  needs  of  people  with  disabilities  due  to  lack  of  sufficient  aT(assistive  Technology)  devices  and  technical  barriers  to  handle  these  devices  by  the  librarians  and  the  users.  Therefore,  before  providing  the  services to the users, the librarians must be trained  to  handle  the  various  assistive  technologies  and  should learn to communicate with the different types  of  the  disabled  people. 
Due to the rising complexities in the technologies,  the libraries of future are tasked with an enormous  amount of responsibility therefore the development  of an effective communication network between the  creators of information and the end users will prove  beneficial  in  adopting  the  new  technologies  by  the  libraries in modern digital environment. an exhaustive  research  on  the  ‘role  of  assistive  technology  in  the  lives  of  people  with  disabilities’  can  be  done  which  can  help  to  explore  the  types  of  assistive  aids/devices required by the people with disabilities  on  the  basis  of  the  degree  of  disability  suffered  by  them.  The  detailed  study  of  the  ‘compatibility  of  the  available  assistive  softwares  for  the  blind/ vision-impaired  people  with  the  web’  can  help  the  libraries  in  selecting  the  suitable  software  for  the  users which can reduce the technical barriers faced  by the blind/vision impaired users during the access  of  the  Web.
