ABSTRACT 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of Information and communication technology  (ICT)  by  the  visually  impaired  students  in  Calicut  University,  Kerala.  Semi-structured  interviews  were  employed  to  collect  data  from  a  representative  sample  of  100  visually  impaired  students  from  the  departments and affliated colleges of the University. The study found that a large majority of the students  are computer literates and use mobile phones frequently. A good number of them use screen readers  in their mobile phones. However, the foreign accent of screen reading programs is a challenge for the  students. The support of friends and family members is very helpful for the students to acquire the skills  of ICT. Microsoft Offce and Jaws screen reader supported by Windows operating system are the most  popular software among the students. Use of internet by the students is very less and most widely used  internet  service  is  www  followed  by  e-mail.  It  is  found  that  a  majority  of  the  students  need  training  in  word  processing  and  Internet. This  study  provides  useful  information  about  the  use  of  ICT  by  visually  
impaired students in India.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Information and communication technology (ICT)  provides  many  opportunities  for  social  inclusions1.   The ICT offers great benefits to people with disabilities  and enables them to participate equally in the social,  cultural  and  economic  developments.  The  ICT  can  enable  them  to  improve  their  quality  of  life  and  to  live  in  much  the  same  way  as  those  who  are  not  disabled2.  They  can  accomplish  tasks  that  would  be  impossible  to  do  without  ICT.  However,  the  prospective  promised  with  the  ICT  often  has  not  the  reality  for  most  people  with  disabilities.  They  had  been  kept  away  from  the  mainstream  society,  denominating  them  as  disabled2.  At  present,  the  term  disabled  is  no  more  prevalent;  instead  of  it  has  been  using  words  like  differently-abled  or visually-impaired.  It  is  important  to  recognise  that  visually-impaired may have counterbalancing strengths  in  other  areas.    
With  the  widespread  use  of  the  internet  and  increased reliance on e-resources, the internet has  become a prominent channel of online communication  and e-resources. However, the internet has created  a  digital  divide  between  those  who  have  access  
and  those  who  do  not  have  access  to  the  internet.  Although  the  internet  access  is  increasing  across  the  world,  many  visually-impaired  have  no  access  to the internet. Therefore, the internet could become  a  barrier  for  the  visually-impaired  increasing  the  information gap by missing out on all the advantages  available through the internet2.  Internet  will  enable  visually-impaired students to access more e-resources  and work independently than what they could do via  traditional methods3.  They  can  access  the  internet  as  long  as  the  interfaces,  resources  and  services  on  the  internet  are  designed  appropriately.      
The  study  has  reviewed  a  number  of  available  literatures published in national and foreign publications.   Bayir4, et al.  conducted a study on computer literacy  of  visually-impaired  in  Turkey.  The  study  shows  that the cost of hardware and software for visually- impaired  is  more  expensive,  therefore  the  ratio  of  having  computer  among  visually-impaired  is  low.  Murphy5, et al.  conducted a study on the difficulties  experienced  by  visually-impaired  internet  users.  The  findings  from  the  survey  have  informed  the  development  of  non-visual  interface,  which  uses  the  benefits  of  multimodal  technologies  to  present

spatial and navigational cues to the visually-impaired  users.  In  another  study, fichten6, et  al.   found  that  most  visually-impaired  students  use  software  that  reads text on the screen; many of these can 'read'  icons,  tabs,  and  menu  bars  as  well.  puffelen7,  et  al.  found  that  the  support  of  family  was  very  helpful  to  acquire  ICT  skills  for  visually-impaired.   Soderstrom  &  ytterhus8   investigated  the  symbolic  values  and  use  of  assistive  technologies  from  the  world  of  ICT  in  the  daily  lives  of  11  visually- impaired  young  Norwegians.  To  fit  in  as  ordinary  young people the visually-impaired participants reject  ICT  assistive  technologies  whenever  possible. The  partially  sighted  participants  who  were  somehow  capable  of  participating  in  online  interactions  with  their peers without ICT assistive technologies reject  them. The blind participants, however, do not have  the option of participating online without ICT assistive  technologies  and,  consequently,  they  accept  ICT  assistive technologies. Uimuek9, et al.  showed that  there  is  a  necessity  of  regulations  for  visually- impaired  learners  to  develop  their  ICT  skills. 
There  has  been  a  surprising  lack  of  research  in  the  use  of  ICT  by  visually-impaired.  This  study  investigates the use of Information and Communication  Technology by visually-impaired students in Calicut  University.  Calicut  University  is  the  second  oldest  and  the  largest  University  of  the  State  of  Kerala,  that caters to the needs of a large number of rural,  semi-urban, and urban students of the state as well  as  to  several  national  and  international  students.  Established in 1968, the university is imparting higher  education to over three hundred thousand students10.  This study provides useful information about the use  of  ICT  by  visually-impaired  students  in  India. 
2.    OBJECTIVES  OF  THE  STUDY 
The  main  aim  of  the  study  was  to  investigate  the use of ICT by the visually-impaired students in  Calicut  University.  To  fulfill  this  aim,  the  following  specific  objectives  were  identified: 
(a) Examine the ICT literacy of the visually-impaired  
students. 
(b) Assess the use of ICT by the visually-impaired  
students. 
3.    RESEARCH  DESIGN 
The study was conducted among the visually-impaired  students in the departments and affiliated colleges of  the Calicut University, Kerala. A representative sample  of  100  visually-impaired  students  was  selected  for  the study. Semi-structured interviews with schedules  were  employed  to  collect  data  from  the  students.  A  total  of  93  students  responded  to  the  questions.  Microsoft-Excel was used to analyse the data. The  investigators used computation of percentages as the  statistical  technique  for  the  purpose  of  analysis.  
4.    RESULTS AND  DISCUSSIONS 
4.1  Computer  Literacy  
Visual impairments change the way the students  gather information and limit the opportunities to learn  through observation. The ICT literacy is very essential  for visually-impaired students to access educational  resources and programmes such as those delivered  via  the  internet  or  multimedia  educational  portals.  The students were asked to indicate their computer  literacy  and  the  responses  were  summarised.  The  analysis shows that a majority 80 (86.02 %) of the  students  were  computer  literates,  while  a  very  few  13  (13.98  %)  were  computer  illiterates. 
4.2  Methods  of  Learning  Computer 
Visually-impaired  students  need  special  trainings  and  classes  to  learn  the  skills  of  ICT.  They  need  assistance  from  their  family  members,  friends  and  teachers.  Institutions  can  also  provide  sophisticated  assistive  technologies  for  visually- impaired  students.  The  students  were  asked  to  indicate  the  methods  of  learning  computer  and  the  responses are summarised in the Table 1. It is found  that out of the 80 computer literates, a good number 31 (38.75 %) of the students learned the computer  skills with the help of their friends and family members. 30  (37.5  %)  of  the  students  learned  the  skills  through  short  term  courses.  A  very  few  students  learned the skill from their peer colleagues (12.5 %)  or  by  themselves  (11.25  %).  This  reveals  that  the  assistance  from  the  friends  and  family  members  is  very helpful for a visually-impaired to learn the skill  of  ICT.  It  further  reveals  that  short  term  courses  and  training  programs  are  also  effective  methods  for  visually-impaired  to  acquire  the  skills  of  ICT.

4.3 Use  of  ICT-based  Tools  and  Services 
The  ICT  plays  an  essential  role  in  education,  lifelong learning, work and leisure. Rapid developments  in  ICT  especially  in  portable  hand-held  devices,  improvements in voice and magnification software, and  accessible websites present tremendous opportunities  for  visually-impaired  students.  The  students  were  asked  to  indicate  the  use  of  ICT-based  tools  and  services  and  the  responses  are  summarised  in  the  Table  2.  The  table  shows  that  a  large  majority  88  (94.62  %)  of  the  students  use  mobile  phones  frequently.  None  of  the  students  use  daisy  books.  37 (39.78 %) students use desktop computers  and

40  (43  %)  students  use  CD-DVD  frequently.  A  very  few  students  use  laptop  computers (12.9 %) and e-books (11.83 %).  It shows that daisy  books  are  not  at  all  popular  among  the  students.  Majority  of  them  use  screen  readers.

4.4  Confidence  in  ICT  Tasks 
The ICT has become a catalyst for economic and  social developments. However, the benefits of ICT  have spread unequally, especially between disabled  and non-disabled. The ICT can effectively used for  imparting  knowledge  to  students  with  additional  learning  needs  and  disabilities.  It  is  a  fact  that  many  visually-impaired  students  lack  confidence  with  ICT  and  often  refuse  to  use  it.  The  students  were  asked  to  indicate  their  confidence  in  ICT  tasks and the responses were tabulated in Table 3.  A  large  majority  70  (87.5  %)  students  stated  that  they  can  do  the  data  entry  work  by  themselves.  A  very  few  11  (11.25  %)  do  this  with  the  help  of  someone  and  one  student  (1.25  %)  didn’t  know  what  it  means.  A  good  number  36  (45  %)  of  the  students  can  do  disk  writing  task  by  themselves.  10 (12.5 %) students only heard about it and don’t  know how to right a disk. About half (52.5 %) of the  students can do the internet surfing by themselves.   A  few  20  (25  %)  students  only  heard  about  it  and  don’t  know  how  to  surf  Internet.  A  good  number 30  (37.5  %)  of  the  students  can  do  scanning  and  editing  by  themselves.  About  half  (48  %)  of  the  students  indicated  that  they  don’t  know  how  to  play  computer  games.  A  large  majority 74  (92.5  %)  of  the  students  can  play  audio/video  by  themselves. 
4.5  Use  of  Software  
Visually-impaired  students  can  use  different  types  of  assistive  technologies  including  devices  such  as  talking  calculators,  computer  programs  with  speech  output  and  electronic  writing  tablets

with  speech  output.  The  students  can  use  a  variety of software to assist them in their academic  assignments  including  screen  reading  software  and  listen  to  the  notes  through  a  computer.  Jaws  is  a  very  common  software  for  visually-impaired  students.  It  is  increasingly  compatible  with  more  programs and websites, especially as web designers  take  a  more  accessible  approach  to  building  their web-based  contents.  Kurzweil  is  also  widely  used  by  visually-impaired  students  for  its  invaluable  scanning  capabilities.  Zoomtext  is  another  useful  program  for  individuals  who  have  low  or  limited  vision.  Visually-impaired  people  mainly  use  screen  readers  while  people  with  low-vision  may  access  a  much  wider  variety  of  software  applications11.  persons with low-vision can use the applications that  magnify the screen display in order to facilitate the  performance  of  visual  tasks  such  as  reading  texts,  selecting  menus,  responding  to  system  prompts  and navigating between different parts of websites.   Usually  this  magnification  involves  the  use  of  a  screen  magnifier  software  application  that  runs  as  a  background  task12.  The  students  were  asked  to  indicate  the  use  of  software  and  the  responses  are  given  in  the  Table  4.  The  analysis  shows  that  a  majority  77  (82.8  %)  of  the  students  use  MS  Word. 34 (36.56 %) of the students use MS-Excel. 27  (29.03  %)  uses  powerpoint.  A  very  few

11  (11.83  %)  use  Linux  supported  Open  Office.  It  is  found  that  the  most  used  application  software  package  is  MS  Office.  Only  a  very  few  of  the  students  use  Linux  supported  office  software. 
Table  4  depicts  that  more  than  half,  i.e., 44  (55  %)  of  the  students  use  Windows  operating  system whereas a very few (11.25 %) use Linux. A  few  25  (31.25  %)  students  indicated  that  they  use  both Windows and Linux. Two students (2.5 %) have  Android  in  their  mobile  phones.  It  is  found  that  a  majority  61  (76.25  %)  students  uses  Jaws  and  a  good  number  of  the  students  use  Orca  as  screen  readers. A very few (3.75 %) use Windows Eyes as  screen  reader.    It  is  very  clear  from  the  table  that  Jaws  supported  by  Windows  operating  system  is

34  (42.5  %)  of  the  students  use  Kurzweil  as  screen reading software. A very few use Real Speak  (7.5 %) and Easy OCR (6.25 %). Only two (2.5 %)  students  responded  that  they  use  Zoomtext  as  magnifying  software.  It  is  revealed  that  the  use  of  scanning  and  magnifying  software  is  not  very  common  among  the  students. 
4.6  Use  of  Internet  Tools  and  Services  
The internet can be of great value to visually- impaired students as it empowers them to independently  complete  tasks  which  they  would  normally  not  be  able  to  accomplish  without  help  from  others.   Visually-impaired  students  can  access  internet  using  a  traditional  browser  with  text-to-speech  software.  The  students  can  use  screen  readers  that  provides  not  only  output  but  to  some  extent  an  improved  interface.  Internet  browsers  designed  specifically  for  visually-impaired  should  be  able  to  discriminate  the  structure  of  webpages  and  pass  the  information  to  the  user  in  a  meaningful  way.  Students with low-vision can use screen magnification  software or rely on features built into the operating  system  or  the  browser  to  enhance  the  visibility  of  websites.    Screen  magnification  software  makes  text  and  graphics  on  websites  bigger.  However, visually-impaired  students  face  special  barriers  in  using  the  internet,  aside  from  those  related  to  material  access  and  computer-related  trainings13.  The  students  were  asked  to  indicate  the  use  of  internet  tools  and  services.  Table  5  depicts  that  most  frequently  used  internet  application  is  search  engine (33.3 %), followed by e-mail (28.9 %). Majority  (57.8  %)  of  the  students  use  WWW  occasionally.  e-mail  is  the  only  one  application  used  by  all  the  students.  It  reveals  that  internet  use  is  generally  not  so  common  among  the  students.  Most  widely  and frequently used internet services are WWW, and  e-mail.  It  is  seen  that  social  networking  sites  are  not so popular among the students. But mailing list  (like Access India) is one of the internet applications  which  are  used  for  knowledge  sharing  among  the  students.

4.7  Confidence  in  Internet  Tasks 
Visually-impaired students can use the internet  with screen readers to complete their assignments.   However,  it  is  found  that  most  of  the  students  are  not so confident about the use of internet. Website  designers and developers should take into account  visually-impaired while designing web interfaces. The  students were asked to indicate their confidence in  internet tasks and the responses are summarised in  Table  6.    The  analysis  shows  that  a  large  majority  (91.1  %)  of  the  computer  literate  students  can  get  into  internet  by  themselves.    A  very  few  (4.4  %)  know  this  but  can’t  do  it  and  another  few  (4.4  %)  can  do  this  with  the  help  of  someone.  About  half  23  (51.1  %)  of  the  students  can  copy/download  files  from  the  Internet  by  themselves.  A  few  (22.2  %)  students  know  what  this  means  but  can’t  do  it.  The  table  shows  that  a  majority  (64.4  %)  of  the  students can send e-mail by themselves and a good  number (40 %) of the students know how to attach  a  file  with  a  mail.  A  very  few  (17.8  %)  students  indicated  that  they  can  send  mail  with  the  help  of  someone.    It  is  found  that  attaching  file  with  email  is seen as the most difficult task since 22 % of the  students not even heard about this. More than half  (55  %)  of  the  students  can  search  a  word  in  the  Internet by themselves. Another important factor is  that  only  a  few  students  show  the  confidence  to  send  an  online  application  by  themselves.  
Internet tasks 
while  using  electronic  documents  and  internet  with  screen  reading  programs.  The  foreign  accent  of  screen  reading  programs  is  a  challenge  for  the  students.  It  may  due  to  the  fact  that  most  of  the  screen  reading  software  is  designed  abroad.  This  problem can be easily overcome by designing screen  reading  software  for  visually-impaired  in  India.

4.9  Screen  Reader  in  Mobile  Phones  
Various  forms  of  assistive  technologies  are  available  to  help  visually-impaired  to  live  in  the  electronic  environment.  Screen  reader  software  speaks aloud what's on a computer screen or mobile  phone,  including  desktop  icon  labels,  document  contents,  and  drop-down  and  tool  bar  menu  items.    An  added  benefit  is  that  screen  readers  include shortcut keys that allow visually-impaired to  navigate around websites with consistent structures.  Visually-impaired  students  can  use  mobile  phones  with  screen  readers.  The  students  were  asked  to

4.8  Foreign  Accent  in  Screen  Reading  
Software 
Visually-impaired can use screen reading software  to access language documents and websites.  This  software  produce  audio  versions  of  electronic  text  and  speech  recognition  programs  change  what  is  spoken  into  an  electronic  document.  However,  the  most  important  barrier  while  using  screen  reading  software  is  the  foreign  accent  of  the  software.  It  is  hindering  the  use  of  this  software. The  students  were asked to indicate the difficulties and problems  while they use electronic documents and internet with  screen readers. The data in the table 7 shows that  nearly half of the students (47.5 %) face difficulties

A  majority  (55  %)  of  the  students  do  not  use  screen  readers  in  their  mobile  phones.  It  may  be  due  to  the  high  cost  of  screen  reading  software. A good number (43.01 %) of the students

4.10  ICT  Training  Needs 
Visually-impaired  students  face  difficulties  in  accessing the most basic forms of education. They  can use assistive technologies to access traditionally  inaccessible educational contents. These technologies  are  key  driving  force  to  equip  visually-impaired  students  to  access  the  digital  environment  well  in  the  classroom  and  workplace.  However,  sufficient  training  should  be  provided  to  visually-impaired  students  to  use  different  assistive  technologies  including development of relevant content, provision  of  software  and  hardware  resources.  The  students  were  asked  to  indicate  the  areas  in  which  they  need training and the responses are shown in the Table  9.  It  is  found  that  a  majority  of  the  students  need training in both word processing (64.52 %) and  disk writing (62.36 %). Nearly half (47.32 %) of the  students  need  training  in  keyboard  familiarisation.  Most of the students (97.85 %) need training in the  use  of  Internet  tools/services/utilities.  A  very  few  (15.05  %)  students  demanded  training  in  mobile  usage. five  (5.38  %)  students  want  to  get  trained  in other areas such as music editing, graphics and  animation,  web  designing,  programming,  etc.

5.    CONCLUSIONS 
It  is  revealed  that  a  large  majority  of  the  visually-impaired  students  are  computer  literates.   However,  they  are  deprived  of  getting  the  benefits  of ICT. The benefits of ICT have spread unequally,  especially between disabled and non-disabled. ICT  can  effectively  used  for  imparting  knowledge  on  visually-impaired  students.  The  support  of  friends  and family members is very helpful for the students  to  acquire  the  skill  of  ICT.  It  is  found  that  a  large  majority of the students use mobile phones frequently  and a good number of them use screen readers in  their  mobile  phones.    However,  the  foreign  accent  of  screen  reading  programs  is  a  challenge  for  the  students. Rapid developments in hand-held devices  especially  in  mobile  phones  provide  tremendous  opportunities  for  visually-impaired  students.  The  students  face  difficulties  in  the  use  of  various  software  and  MS-Office  software  package  is  the  
most  used  application  software.  Internet  use  is  generally  not  so  common  among  the  students.   Most  widely  and  frequently  used  internet  service  is  WWW  followed  by  e-mail.  
It is found that the students are potential enough  to use ICT. They lack confidence in high level ICT  tasks  and  often  refuse  to  use  it.    The  use  of  ICT  depends  on  the  environment  within  which  it  is  to  be used, including the constraints, barriers and the  attitudes of the users14. The students can use ICT  independently if the designs provide enough degree  of  modification  to  assist  the  visually-impaired.  The  students should give sufficient training to empower  them with ICT. They should also get enough assistance  from their family members and friends. The society  should learn many things to assist visually-impaired  to  enable  them  to  live  independently.
