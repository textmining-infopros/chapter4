The  article  investigates  the  relationship  among  top  ten  world  universities  (TTWU),  top  ten Asian  universities  (TTAU)  and  top  ten  Indian  universities  (TTIU)  based  on  the  exploratory  study  of  weblink  analysis. Inlinks and outlinks analysis try to explore the relationship among these universities. The fndings  suggest  that  although TTIU  are  generating  3.71  %  outlinks  to TTWU  but  receives  only  0.67  %  inlinks  from them. On the other hand, inlinks and outlinks to TTAU are far less than TTWU. An interesting result  refects that the percentage of inlinks and self-links for top ten Indian (30.51% and 69.49%) and Asian  universities (31.45 % and 68.55 %) are less than top ten world universities (55.25% and 44.75%).  
Keywords: Weblink analysis, co-link analysis, Indian university, Asian universities 
1.  InTroduCTIon 
It  is  believed  that  the  study  of  link  analysis  helps the possibility of exploring useful information.  After studying the references of an article, one can  find  many  useful  links  or  concepts  for  building  up  the  document.  So,  there  is  a  link  or  association  among  the  similar  subjects.  It’s  true  for  all  the  subjects  in  the  universe.  The  same  analogy  may  be  applied  to  websites.  With  this  belief,  Google  used  the  link-based  algorithm  for  identifying  the  best  webpage.  The  research  on  weblink  analysis  started in 1995-96 including computer science1  and  mathematical  structure  and  complexity  analysis2;  information  science3.  Larson4   made  an  exploratory  analysis  of  ‘Bibliometrics  for  the  world  wide  web’.  Almind & Ingwersen5  coined the term ‘webometrics’,  
Brin  &  Page8   developed  the  concept  of  PageRank  at Stanford University as part of a research project  basically  to  develop  new  search  engine  powered  by PageRank and have an added advantages over  others.  Later,  they  developed  an  excellent  search  engines called Google, the most admired and used  search  engines  in  the  world  based  on  PageRank  algorithm.  Stuart9 et  al. investigated  the  potential  of  weblinks  to  act  as  an  indicator  of  collaboration  through  detailed  classification  of  2600  links  from  universities  to  government,  commercial  and  other  domains.  The  result  showed  that  the  majority  of  weblinks on university webpages did not reflect the  collaboration  between  the  webpage  owner  and  the  target  webpage  owner.  Still,  significant  number  of  links  reflects  the  collaborative  relationships.

The studies on hyperlink analysis have extensively  undergone by applying existing bibliometric techniques  to  the  web4,6.  There  is  a  controversy  between  hyperlinks  and  citations.  Generally,  citations  are  applied  in  conventional  print  documents,  whereas  hyperlinks  are  applied  in  a  web  document.  
Egghe7   rightly  indicates  that  hyperlinks  could  be bi-directional while references are uni-directional.  
may  give  proper  care  for  the  upliftment  of  their  existing  ranking  not  only  at  the  national  level  but  also  at  the  global  level.  Few  studies  on  ranking  of  Indian  universities10   and  Asian  countries 
11,  African  countries, Australian countries, European countries  were  conducted  so  far.  Besides,  national  as  well  as  global  ranking  system  has  emerged  and  few  notable ranking systems are: Ranking Web of World  Universities  (RWWU),  Shanghai  Ranking,  Times  Higher Education (THE), 4 International and College  Universities  (4ICU),  etc.

Weblink  analysis  specifically  addresses  the  collaborative  relationship  through  co-link  analysis.  Co-link  may  be  of  two  types:  Co-inlinks  and  co- outlink.  It  would  be  an  interesting  to  know  how  far  the Indian universities have established collaborative  relationship  in  academic,  teaching  and  research,  and R&D works with top level world universities as  well  as  with  the  top  level  Asian  universities.  
Weblink  analysis  is  the  focus  of  study.  The  importance  of  weblinks  is  duly  acknowledged  by  WWW’  founder  Berners  Lee12   Larson 
4 
  is  one  of  the  pioneers  to  investigate  the  link  structures  in  academic  web  spaces.  He  used Altavista  in  a  co- citation  analysis  for  earth  science  related  websites  and  could  produce  clustering  of  websites  that  had  topical similarities. Henzinger13  reviewed link structures  analyses from computer science perspective, showing  how links could be used by search engine in ranking  algorithms. Bjorneborn14  has contributed the idea of  link structure in his PhD thesis which described the  link  structure  of  the  academic  institutions  of  UK.  Besides,  a  series  of  link  terminology  were  given.  Harries15  ,  et al.  expressed that hyperlinks between  academic websites can be used to map disciplinary  structures  and  identified  evidence  of  connections  between  disciplines.  Links  within  a  discipline  were  found to be a different in character to links between  pages  in  different  disciplines. 
Earlier link analysis had concentrated on developing  metrics to measure the impact of websites.  Ingwersen6 introduced  the  concept  of  web  impact  factor  (WIF)  to  measure  the  impact  of  a  web  site  using  various  types of link counts. Among these, the external WIF  was  highly  used.  Smith16   as  well  as  Björneborn  &  Ingwersen17   found  that  the  external  inlink  count  is  a  better  measure  than  the  total  inlink  count  to  measure  the  visibility  of  a  website.  
University ranking at the local, regional as well  as  global  level  is  prime  attraction  to  everyone.  Aguillo18, et al.  compared popular university ranking  systems  using  a  set  of  similarity  measures.  The  findings  showed  that  there  is  reasonable  similarity  between  the  ranking  methodologies. 
Hemerks & Van Den Besselaar19   in  their  study  showed that hyperlinks are the most commonly used  alternatives to study websites and structures on the  web. They analysed and compared hyperlink networks  using a variety of linking units on the different levels  of  aggregation  and  specificity.  The  inter-university  web connectivity phenomenon had been studied for  African countries20  and for Kenyan universities 
21. They  used link analysis approach to compare Kenyan and  South African universities based on several web based  indicators such as number of web-pages, number of  inlinks and outlinks. Li22, et al.  had studied national  and international university even at the departmental  
132 
website  interlinking.  As  departments  are  subject- oriented,  departmental  interlinking  pattern  may  be  illustrated. Three  departments  have  been  taken  up  like  physics,  chemistry,  and  biology  in  Australia,  Canada  and  UK  to  study  link  pattern  differences  and  compared  each  set  of  patterns. 
Vaughan  &  You23   added  a  new  dimension  in  webometric  research  by  introducing  the  concept  ‘word co-occurances on webpages’ as a measure of  the relatedness of organisation. An experiment was  made in a group of telecommunication industry and  found  that  web  co-word  analysis  could  potentially  be  useful  for  web  co-link  analysis. 
Therefore,  the  crux  of  the  study  aimed  at  to  focus on finding out the hyperlink relationship among  top  ten  universities  within  themselves  as  well  as  with Asian  and  Indian  universities. 
3. MeThodology 
The selection of data set for our study includes  TTIU,  TTAU  and  TTWU  based  on  Web  Ranking  of  World  Universities  (RWWU)  January  201124   by  Cybermetrics Lab, Spain. The names of the universities  along  with  their  corresponding  codes  and  domain  names  are  mentioned  in  Table  1. 
Henceforth, the codes may be used to represent  these universities in the following tables for optimum  use  of  space.  The  webpage  for  all  the  universities  can  be  calculated  using  domain:  iisc.ernet.in.  
The total inlinks for a particular university (say,  Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore having domain  name  iisc.ernet.in)  are  determined  using  the  query  as:  linkdomain:iisc.ernet.in  –  domain:  iisc.ernet.in.  The  same  way  the  inlinks  for  all  the  top  Indian  universities  as  well  as  top  world  universities  are  retrieved through Yahoo! search engine dated 16-18  February  2011. After  collection  of  data,  a  series  of  measures have been applied to know and to find out  the  nature  and  degree  of  hyperlink  relationship.  
4.   r eseArCh  QuesTIons 
For  simplicity,  it  is  assumed  that  A,  B,  and  C  are  three  different  websites  having  valid  domain  name.  Among  these,  if  two  websites  A  and  B  are  receiving  links  from  third  website  C  then  we  can  call  site  A  and  B  are  co-linked.  The  analysis  of  the  websites  A  &  B  may  be  termed  as  co-inlink  analysis.  On  the  other  hand,  if  two  sites  A  &  B  are  giving  links  to  third  site  C  then  site A  &  B  are  called  co-linking.  The  analysis  of  websites  A  &  B  may  be  called  as  co-outlink  analysis.  The  sum  of  other  co-inlink  analysis  and  co-outlink  analysis  may  be  termed  as  co-link  analysis.  On  the  basis  of the fundamental concept, following few research  questions  may  be  raised  to  achieve  the  objectives  and  purpose  of  the  study:

Inlinks  from  TTWU  as  have  been  shown  in  the  Table  3  is  referred  in  Table  6  and  based  on  the  data,  percentage  of  inlinks  for  each  Indian  university  is  calculated  over  total  inlinks. 
It  implies  that  only  less  than  one  percentage  inlinks  received  from  TTWU.  The  link  analysis  of  each  university  may  be  done  through  tabular  as  well as graphical presentation. But for convenience,  only  first  rank  university  of  each  set  of  data  under  study  have  considered  for  analysis.

university 
5.5.1  Indian  Institute  of  Science  (IISc),  Bangalore  
of  outlinks  and  inlinks  among  the  top  ten  world  universities  in  terms  of  percentage.  It  shows  that  outlinks  from  IISc  Bangalore  to  Harvard  University  (23.54  %)  and  inlinks  from  IISc  to  University  of  Wisconsin  Madison  (28.29%)  were  highest. 
5.5.2 
Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  (MIT) 
      The  MIT  had  only  68  outlinks  to  all  TTIU  in  which highest outlinks to IISc, Bangalore (41.18 %)  followed by IIT Kanpur (25 %) and equal number of  outlinks  to  IIT  Bombay  (11.76  %)  and  IIT  Madras  (11.76%). But, MIT receives 1005 number of inlinks  from  TTIU  in  which  TTIFR,  Mumbai  gives  highest  inlinks  (33.13  %)  followed  by  IIT  Bombay  (19  %). 
      Figure  2  reflects  that  MIT  generates  highest  number  of  outlinks  (28)  to  IISc  Bangalore  and  
of  outlinks  (1916).  Figure  1  shows  the  distribution 
   The IISc Bangalore is having the highest number

JALAL: A COMPARATIVE WEBLINK ANALYSIS AMONG TOP  I NDIAN, ASIAN, AND  W ORLD UNIVERSITIES 
5.5.3  National  Taiwan  University 
   According to Ranking Web of World Universities  (www.webometrics.info), National Taiwan University  is  given  the  credit  of  being  rank  no.  1  university  among  the  Asian  countries.  Figure  3  shows  the  distribution  of  inlinks  and  outlinks  exclusively  from  and  to  top  ten  Indian  universities  respectively.  
  Although  it  seems  a  very  high  percentage  of  outlinks  and  inlinks,  the  absolute  figure  is  very  pathetic, which is been reflected through the lower  line  in  the  Figure  3.  The  above  figure  shows  that  National Taiwan University generates highest number  of  outlinks  (10)  to  IIT  Kanpur  and  receives  highest  number  of  inlinks  (11)  from  IIT  Bombay. 
5.6  Co-inlink    Matrix  for  the  TTI u 
Co-inlink  analysis  is  one  of  the  important  techniques  for  weblink  analysis.    The  co-inlinks  between two websites (say IISc, Bangalore and IIT,  Kanpur) can be determined using the query syntax  as: linkdomain:iisc.ernet.in AND linkdomain:iitk.ac.in.  The  matrix  formed  for  TTIU  using  above  query  
submitted  in  Yahoo!  search  engine  is  mentioned  in  Table  9. 
Table  10  expresses  the  co-link  matrix  for  the  TTIU  where  both  inlinks  and  outlinks  have  been  shown.  The  boolean  query  syntax:  linkdomain:  X  AND  domain:Y,  where  X  is  the  receiving  links  and  Y  is  generating  links. 
5.7  similarity  Measure  using  Cosine  Technique 
One  important  technique  is  the  application  of  cosine  method.  In  webometric  study,  co-link  matrix  is formed using the query, linkdomain: university-A  +  site:university-B.  The  cosine  technique  can  be  applied to the whole set of data as retrieved using  the  above  query.  In  order  to  build  the  map,  an  asymmetrical matrix can be used between the links of  all accredited Indian universities. The cosine can be  used to calculate the similarity among the websites.  The  formula  is:Sin S S ( ) 
∑ee ij

DJLIT,  VOL.  33,  NO.  2, MARCH   2013 
The  matrix  can  be  turned  to  distances  and  multidimensional scaling (MDS) map can be formed.  Then  map  may  be  plotted  with  SPSS  and  finally  it  will  be  displayed  with  Ucinet.  Cosine  value  for  the  group  of  TTIUs  may  be  calculated  using  the  help  of  above  co-link  matrix.  
= ==3341536 33415363× 
3862877.9 
0.8650 
4246676 3513766 
Therefore,  it  is  found  that  for  the  case  of  top  level Indian universities, the cosine value is 0.8650,  which  implies  that  there  is  a  strong  similarity  in  hyperlink  pattern  among  TTIU. 
5.8  Key  Indicators 
The key webometric indicators are mentioned in  Table  11.  The  impact  of  website  can  be  measured  using  some  metrics  as: 
5.8.1  Web  Impact  Factor  (WIF) 
    The web impact factor, which may be an indicator  for measuring the impact of website is accepted by  many scholars although there are many controversies  and  regarding  the  acceptance  of  the  result.  The WIF  can  be  calculated  as: W I F = 
V 
, 
W 
where V denotes as visibility which are measured with  number  of  inlinks.  The  visibility  may  be  calculated  using  the  Boolean  query  syntax  as:  linkdomain:X  –domain:X,  where  X  is  the  domain  name.  In  our  study, it is found that Harvard University being 2nd topper  is  having  the  highest  WIF  (1.14),  University  of Tokyo, being 2nd  topper in Asian university having  highest  WIF  (0.53)  and  University  of  Delhi  being  the 6th  topper Indian university occupies the highest  WIF  (0.72) 
5.8.2  Measuring  Web  Usability  Factor  (WUF)  
5.8.3  Measuring  Link  Propensity  (LP) 
Link  propensity  may  be  measured  using  the  formula  as:LP = 
L inks from s ite A to s ite B 
[( ) ( )], P ages in site A * P ages in site B 
where A and B denotes  site names and the denominator  can be calculated as: linkfromdomain:X AND domain:Y,   where  X  and  Y  are  domain  names. 
5.8.4  Link  Metrics 
  Ingwersen’s  (1998)  concept  of  web  impact  factor is the primary link metrics. Counting average  inlinks per page for a site, counting average inlinks  per faculty members (Thelwall, 2001a) are also few  examples.  Table  11  summaries  some  key  results,  which  may  be  of  interest  to  look  at  a  glance  the  comparative situation among TTWU, TTAU and TTIU  through  following  key  variables.  
 From Table 11, it is clearly visible that average  inlinks  are  very  less  with  compared  to  top  ten  World  universities.  Therefore,  it  is  understood  that  the  variability  in  the  distribution  of  webpages  and  inlinks  are  very  high. 
6. dIsCussIons  And  ConClusI ons 
The  study  has  thrown  a  light  on  the  presence  of  web  interconnectivity:  
(i)  Between  top  level  Indian  universities  with  top  
level  World  universities,  and  
(ii)  Between  top  level  Indian  universities  with  top  
level  Asian  universities.  
It  is  found  from  these  studies  that  there  is  comparatively  weaker  web  connectivity  between  top  Indian  universities  with  Asian  universities  in  comparison  with  top  level  world  universities.  The  study  reflects  that  for  the  case  of  top  level  Indian  universities, the cosine value is 0.8650, which implies  
be  calculated  using  the  formula  as: WUF = 
O 
W where O denotes as outlinks (it is calculated using  linkfromdomain:X,  where  X  is  the  domain  name. 
The WUF measures the usability of websites. It  may  
that there is a strong similarity in hyperlink pattern  
among  top  level  Indian  universities.  
Table 11.  d escriptive  statistics  of  the  data  of  top  ten  
Indian universities (TTIu) (n=10) 
variables TTIu TTAu TTWu Average webpage 1,20,710 18,80,100 65,55,000 Average inlinks 25,400 5,06,200 39,17,600 Average self-links 57,860 1,103,500 31,73,000 Highest WIF 0.74 0.53 1.14 Percentage of inlinks 30.51% 31.45% 55.25% Percentage of self-links 69.49% 68.55% 44.75% 
138 
The  indicators  used  in  ranking  under  different  ranking systems may differ. As a result, the concerned  authority  should  concentrate  upon  improving  those  areas  or  indicators  resulting  into  either  improved  ranking in the global ranking system. The percentage  of inlinks and self-links for top ten Asian universities  are  31.45  %  and  68.55  %  and  same  figure  for  top  ten  Indian  universities  are  30.51  %  and  69.49  %  respectively. Interestingly, if we look the same figure  for  top  ten  world  universities  the  percentage  of  inlinks  are  more  than  percentage  of  self-links  i.e.  inlinks  (55.25  %)  and  self-links  (44.75  %).  
This phenomenon is completely opposite for the  case of Indian and Asian top ten universities. If we  closely analyse the data in Table 11, an interesting  point  may  be  noted  that  the  average  inlinks  for  

========8========

JALAL: A COMPARATIVE WEBLINK ANALYSIS AMONG TOP  I NDIAN, ASIAN, AND  W ORLD UNIVERSITIES 
top  ten  world  universities  are  150  times  more  than  TTIU;  and  7  times  more  than  TTAU;  but  average  webpage  for  top  ten  world  universities  are  only  54  times  more  than  TTIU;  3.5  times  more  than  TTIU.  Hence, it can be concluded that the visibility of top  ten  world  universities  are  far  more  than Asian  and  Indian  universities. 
Based on the summary of findings, the administrators  and  decision  makers  may  take  some  corrective  measures  to  improve  their  web  performance  by  enhancing  the  quality  indicators  and  incorporating  the quality teaching learning materials, sharing the  R&D  outputs,  extending  the  academic  cooperation  thereby enhancing the visibility of their websites in  turn  their  university.
