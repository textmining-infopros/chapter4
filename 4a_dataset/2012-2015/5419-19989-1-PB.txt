The  top  1000  R&D  spenders  (multinational  companies)  had  increased  their  spending  from  $549  billion  in  2008-09  to  $582  billion  in  2010-11.  These  multinational  companies  (MNCs)  play  an  important  role  in  economy  and  R&D  activities  of  host countries, particularly the developing countries.  At  present,  more  than  one  third  of  the  top  1000  global  spenders  (MNCs)  have  set  up  R&D  centers  in  India1. 
India  is  estimated  to  have  the  eighth  largest  annual R&D investments worldwide in FY 2011. Its  share in global annual R&D spending has increased  from 2.6 % in FY 2010 to 2.8 % in FY 2011. In fact,  India’s share in global R&D spending has increased  over the last five years2. Foreign investment in R&D  in India has grown significantly over the years. The  R&D expenditure  through foreign direct investments  (FDI)  has  increased  in  India  from  INR  286  crores  in  2002-03  to  INR  2883  crores  in  2009-10.  The  share  of  foreign  companies  in  overall  Indian  R&D   has  risen  to  about  20  %  by  2009-103. 
According  to  a  Zinnov  report4,  India  currently  hosts  1031  MNC  R&D  centers  till  the  end  of  2013,  growing at 4 % a year, with an employment base of  244000 growing at 11 % per year. Texas Instruments  was  the  first  major  MNC  which  established  an  R&D  center  in  Bangalore  in  19852.  Since  then,  a

number  of  MNCs  from  different  countries  (though  predominantly from USA) have set up R&D centers in  India. Twenty five global MNCs have established R&D  centers in India since the beginning of 2012 alone5. 
Mrinalini6, et al.  (from NISTADS) with the financial  support  of  DST-TAIFAC  carried  out  one  of  the  largest  and  most  comprehensive  survey  of  foreign  investment in R&D in India during 2003-09. According  to  this  survey,  the  total  number  of  FDIs  in  R&D  in  India  was  964  from  706  MNCs  originating  from  23  countries  and  they  together  brought  $29  billion  as  FDI  in  R&D  in  India  during  2003-09.  Country-wise   number  of  FDI  investments  in  R&D  indicates  that  USA  had  largest  number  of  investments  (591),  followed  by  UK  (51),  Germany  (49),  France  (31),  Japan (27), Switzerland (21) and 17 other countries  (127). Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai/Pune  and  Delhi/NCR  account  for  88  %  of  the  inflow  of  FDI  in  R&D  in  India  during  this  period.  In  terms  of  sectoral share of total FDI in R&D, the largest share (50.36 %) was in IT & Software, followed by aerospace (12.52  %),  pharmaceuticals  &  biotechnology (9.72 %), automobiles (9.27 %), machinery & equipments  (3.01 %), services (2.62 %), electronic components  (2.56 %), chemicals (1.25 %), etc. These 706 MNCs  created  247000  jobs  through  R&D  investments  in  India over the past decade and also obtained 1166  patents  during  2003-09.

The presence of these multinational companies  in India is slowly leading to its rapid integration into  the  global  research  system.  India  is  fast  emerging  as a major destination for high-end R&D projects for  MNCs across the globe7. India is being benefited from  these foreign R&D centers in terms of employment,  as  sizable  number  of  PhDs,  Master  and  Bachelor  degree  holders  in  science  and  engineering,  and  technicians, etc., are working on future technologies,  working with sophisticated equipment/machinery and  getting  opportunities  for  specialised  education  and  training abroad. Indian R&D organisations, universities  and industry are also gaining by working with these  foreign  R&D  centers  through  contract  research,  collaborative  research,  training  programmes  and  courses  being  conducted  by  some  of  them.  Many  of  these  foreign  R&D  centers  have  established  collaborated  linkages  with  institutes  of  national  importance,  government  departments,  national  research  laboratories,  engineering  colleges,  etc8.  The research and technology output of foreign R&D  centers  in  India  comes  both  in  the  form  of  patents  and  research  papers.  The  present  paper  analyses  the  publication  output  of  only  21  most  productive  foreign  MNC  R&D  centers  in  India. 
2.    objeCtI veS 
The main objectives of this paper is to analyse  the publication output of most productive 21 foreign  MNC  R&D  centers  in  India  publishing  50  or  more  papers  during  2003-2012.  The  specific  objectives  are  to: 
• Analyse  the  overall  publication  growth  and  
citation  quality  of  their  publication  output;  • Analyse the share of international collaboration  
citation  window  of  three  years  and  information  on  h-index  by  ticking  ‘Citation’  tag  and  (ii)  information  on  international  collaborative  papers  by  ticking  the  ‘Country’  tag.  Such  a  search  strategy  was  run  individually  for  all  21  foreign  R&D  centres  to  get  information  on  their  total  papers,  total  citations  (on  three  year  citation  window),  average  citation  per  paper,  h-index  and  international  collaborative  papers.  The  second  search  strategy  combined  the  search  strategies  of  all  individual  21  foreign  R&D  centres. This combined search strategy was further  restricted  to  ‘Country’  tag  to  get  information  on  collaborative countries and their publication output,  ‘Affiliation’  tag  to  get  information  on  different  type  of national collaborative institutions and their output  and  ‘Subject’  tag  to  get  information  on  different  subject  fields  and  their  publications  output  and  citation  impact  data.      
For  analysing  the  average  citation  per  paper,  the citation data for three years, two years and one  year citation windows have been used for all articles  published  during  2003-10,  2011,  and  2012.
