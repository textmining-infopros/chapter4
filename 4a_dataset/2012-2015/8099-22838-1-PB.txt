The information environment has greatly impacted on teaching, learning and research methods of  higher education worldwide and India is no exception. The new technologies have facilitated smooth and  systematic transformation of data into digital format. This has changed the process of access, retrieve and  use of information by students and researchers. The purpose of this study is to examine the information  seeking  behaviour  of  students  of  two  law  colleges  of  Mumbai. To  understand  the  information  seeking  behaviour of law students the concerned literature has been reviewed and questionnaire was randomly  distributed to get the responses. The study mainly concentrates on frequency of visit to the library, purpose  of information seeking, computer acquaintance, amount of time spent on information gathering activities,  problem faced in information seeking, etc. The results of the study reveal that books are still most heavily  used resources by the students. Majority of the students are familiar with using offine and online legal  databases.  However,  the  students  of  both  the  colleges  face  the  problem  of  information  overload  on  internet and lack of skills to search information. Hence, the study recommends that formal users training  programme shall be conducted to optimise the use of information sources and services.

INtrODUCtION 
Traditional  library  resources  and  search  tools  have been adequately supplemented by the electronic  information resources particularly the internet resource.  information and communication technology (ICT) has  brought  gigantic  changes  in  the  representation  of  information from analog to digital, this shift has led  to new information formats, new ways of distributing  and accessing information, new information services.  Multimedia information can be created, stored, and  distributed in digital format as CD-ROM or on hard  disks,  removable  hard  disks  (external  hard  disk,  pen  drives),  flash  cards  and  other  digital  storage  media. As a result, the large numbers of publishers  have  shifted  their  focus  from  print  to  electronic  publishing,  thereby,  enabling  libraries  to  acquire  a  large  number  of  texts  in  e-form.  This  has  led  to  rise in the demands of users particularly academic  and  research  institutes  users  who  are  tech  savvy  and  want  information  instantly.  At  the  educational  levels  from  elementary  schools  to  universities,  the  students  and  teachers  are  accessing  information  for  their  teaching  and  learning  process1.  Now  with  
new  tools,  one  can  access  information  in  full-text  and  multimedia  from  remote  sites  via  LANs  and  WANs,  etc.2 
The new gadgets like the kindle, smart phones  have become more popular for reading e-books. This  has encouraged the availability of information in digital  format  in  large  scale3.  The  growing  importance  of  ICT's,  the  internet,  and  the  web  has  given  a  new  dimension  to  the  library  and  information  centers4.  The  convenience  of  accessing  remote  information  through www has resulted in tremendous popularity  for  web5.  At  the  same  time  it  has  thrown  many  challenges  to  the  users  as  well  as  libraries.  The  higher  education  system  is  vastly  impacted  by  the  Internet as it provides sea of information. This has  led  to  formation  of  consortium  of  institutes  with  similar  interest. 
The increased volume of information on the Web  has  affected  user’s  information-seeking  behaviour  remarkably6. Information-seeking behaviour involves  personal reasons for seeking information, the kinds  of information which are being sought, and the ways  and sources with which needed information is being

sought7.  The  kind  of  information  required  by  the  user,  methods  adopted  in  searching  information,  environment affected, time spent, problems faced and  solutions made, the satisfaction/dissatisfaction arising  from  the  information  gathered  and  the  relationship  of  the  user  with  the  system–all  come  under  the  purview  of  a  user  study. 
A  user  study  is  the  means  for  a  systematic  examination  of  the  characteristics  of  information  behaviour of the users. The rapid developments in IT  have offered different opportunities to today’s information  seekers  to  access  the  information  resources  in  a  variety  of  forms  and  formats,  including  commonly- available  electronic  information  resources  such  as  CD-ROM databases, Web-OPACs, and the internet.  To  some  extent  these  have  replaced  print-based  information sources as the primary media for storage  and  communication  of  recorded  information. 
2. OBJECtIVES  
The  main  goals  of  the  study  are  to: 
(a) Identify the frequency & purpose of visit to the  
library 
(b)   u nderstand the law students’ acquaintance with  
computer,  internet  and  their  usage 
(c) Know the students’ knowledge about electronic  
legal  information  resources 
(d) Know  the  purpose  of  information-seeking (e) Verify  and  know  the  amount  of  time  spend  on  
information-seeking 
(f) Identify  the  problems  faced  by  law  students  in  
information-seeking 
(g)   u nderstand  the  need  for  information  literacy (h) Suggest  suitable  ways  and  means  to  improve  
the  library  resources  and  services. 
3. LItErAtUrE  rEVIEW 
Electronic  networks  and  different  information  formats are changing information access operations  worldwide. Morrison & Stein3   discussed  the  role  of  the  universities  and  colleges  in  preparing  students  to handle the rapidly expanding range of information  formats. Information and knowledge are the high-value  tools  of  the  present  age.  The  rise  of  the  internet  has led to ‘free information services’. Lennon4   looks  at  how  ‘free’  information  really  is  and  whether  we  can  continue  to  expect  high-quality  information  to  be  available  without  cost  using  the  internet.  
Garrod 5 explains and describes that the academic  libraries  and  library  staff  need  to  adapt  swiftly  to  the new learning environment. The changing format  of  resources  is  the  challenge  for  the  library  in  preserving and managing, Pandey6   throws  light  on  the digital library and traditional library resources and  Management  and  Preservation  of  these  resources.  Asproth’s7  study also falls in the same line such as  some  problem  domains  of  long-term  preservation.

In his study Corbin8  defined competencies required  for  providing  Electronic  information  services.  He  further described personal, basic, general, and special  competencies.  In  the  same  way,  Gakibayo,  Ikoja- Odongo, and Okello-Obura9  in their study assessed  the utilization of electronic information resources in  Mbarara  university  Library  by  students.  
3.2 Information  Seeking  Behaviour 
undoubtedly,  the  accessibility  of  electronic  information  has  steadily  brought  major  changes  to  human  information  behaviour  in  all  walks  of  life.  Marchionini10   in  his  book  explains  the  information  seeking behaviour and changing environment. Bates11 made a survey on decades of research on information  needs and information-seeking behaviour. The internet  is  considered  as  a  potentially  excellent  tool  for  teaching  and  learning.  The  World  Wide  Web  is  a  tool  for  partial  information  gathering  and  learning  for  students.  Fidel  et  al.12   analyse  web  searching  behaviour of students. Nicholas et al.13   studied  on  the  impact  of  the  Internet  on  information  seeking  in  the  British  Media  and  the  focus  was  largely  on  the newspapers. Joinson and Banyard 14 made  two  studies  on  information  seeking  behaviour  on  the  Internet.  Both  investigated  information  seeking  on  the  World  Wide  Web.  It  is  tentatively  argued  that  there is a tendency for people to access information  on  internet.  
Today’s knowledge workers rely increasingly on  information to get their job done, and the availability  of  search  engines  to  locate  relevant  information  is  thus  felt  more  essential  now  than  ever.  Stenmark  and Jadaan15  discuss their study on intranet users’  information  seeking  behaviour  by  analyzing  search  log  files.  Their  study  found  that  the  shifting  trends  in  the  Intranet  search  behaviour.  Thompson16   has  made a study on the information seeking behaviour  of distance education students. The author inferred  in his article that the distinction in information needs  and  use  by  the  students  over  the  years  is  not  due  to a generation divide, as previously reported in the  studies,  but  it  is  due  to  technological  immersion. 
The online tools and websites are the prominent  library services today. Nicol and O'English17  focused  on  Information  seeking  and  satisfaction  with  the  library  services,  the  study  found  that  the  students  and  faculty  are  satisfied  with  library  services  and  information  made  available  to  them  by  the  library  staff. A similar study carried by Natarajan18  describes  different types electronic resources. The study further  discusses information seeking behavior of students,  researchers  and  faculty  in  the  E-environment. 
In a survey conducted by Chidinma19  on information  seeking behaviour of final year law students in Nigeria  found that the respondents use print textbooks and  Google as major research resources, Academic Law

Libraries  and  search  engines  as  major  research  locations.  Whereas,  OGBA’s20   research  findings  show  that  the  respondents  use  the  library  for  print  materials and conducts research on Google despite  numerous  difficulties  that  they  face  in  Google.  He  also discusses the barriers viz, inadequate resources  from the Internet search, inability to select the right  resources  needed  for  research,  lack  of  knowledge  on  sites  navigation  and  lack  of  Nigerian  online  resources.  
4. MEthODOLOgy 
The  questionnaire  is  adopted  to  collect  the  data  which  covers  qualitative  and  quantitative  in  nature.  The  quantitative  method  respond  to  the  questions  ‘what,  when,  how  many’,  the  qualitative  methods respond to the questions ‘how’ and ‘why’.  Questionnaires were distributed among the students  of  two  law  colleges  in  Mumbai  city.  A  total  of  250  questionnaires  were  distributed  randomly  in  both  colleges,  194  completed  questionnaires  were  received and the response rate was 77.6 %. While  distributing questionnaires, care was taken that users  of different gender were represented adequately in  the population. Filled in questionnaires are gathered  and numbered in order of arrival. Wherever possible  ‘closed  questions’  have  been  codified  and  codes  turned  into  data.  All  collected  data  have  been  transferred  on  to  MS-Excel  for  data  tabulation  and  for  drawing  charts,  figures,  etc. 
5. DAtA ANALySIS AND  INtErPrEtAtION 
From  the  data  it  is  observed  that,  out  of  the  total  194  respondents,  92  (47.42  %)  are  male  and  102  (52.58  %)  are  female.  It  shows  that  the  responses received from both male and female are  nearly  equal  in  numbers. 
5.1  Frequency  of  Visit  to  Library 
Table1 indicates that 60 (47.62 %) students from  the Gopaldas Jhamatmal Advani Law College (GJALC)  visit library ‘everyday’ whereas a few number, i.e., 8  (11.76  %)  Lala  Lajpat  Rai  College  of  Law  (LLRCL)  students visit the library everyday. Nearly, a similar  percentage of students visit the GJALC and LLRCL

library  ‘once  in  two  days’  from  both  the  colleges  i.e. 27.78 % and 29.41 % respectively. The majority  (44.12 %) of LLRCL students visit library ‘once in a  week’  as  compared  to  a  few  (15.87  %)  of  GJALC  students.  However,  there  is  not  much  difference  between  the  two  colleges  in  the  case  of  students  visit  to  library  ‘once  in  a  fortnight’  category.  
Table  1  reveals  that,  there  is  a  difference  in  frequency  of  visit  to  libraries  from  both  the  college  students except once in two days, where it is almost  similar  in  both  colleges. 
5.2  Purpose  of  Visit  to  Library 
Table 2 describes different purposes of students’  visit to library. Out of 126 respondents from GJALC,  126 students visit the library ‘to issue/ refer books’,  74  students  visit  the  library  ‘to  read  periodicals’  and  followed  by  65  students  visit  ‘to  search  online  databases’.  Nearly  equal  number  of  (i.e.  25  and  26)  students  visit  the  library  ‘to  use  computers’  and  ‘internet  respectively’.  Similarly,  out  of  68  respondents from LLRCL, all the students (i.e., 68)  visit library ‘to issue / refer books’. Then followed by  50 students who visit ‘to use internet’, 45 students  visit  ‘to  use  computers’,  and  35  visits  ‘to  read  periodicals’.  Whereas,  equal  number  of  students  visit the library ‘to browse CD-ROM databases’ and  ‘online  databases’  (i.e.,  5  each). 
The results of the survey consequently disclose  that,  all  the  students  from  both  the  college  visit  library  for  issue/refer  books  thereby  indicates  that  still  students  have  depended  on  print  resources.  It  is  also  observed  that,  more   number  of  GJALC  students visit the library to use CD-ROM databases  and  online  databases  than  the  LLRCL  students.  It  is  also  observed  that,  most  of  the  students  from  the  LLRCL  visit  library  to  use  computers  and  to  use  Internet  than  the  students  of  GJALC. 5.3 Purpose  of  Information  Seeking  (Using  
Sources) 
Table 3 shows that an equal number of responses  (i.e.  126)  by  the  students  of  GJALC  are  received

Table  3  discloses  very  significant  data  that  all  students  (100  %)  from  both  the  colleges  use  information  sources  to  keep  themselves  up-to-date  and  to  prepare  for  moot  court  completions. 5.4  Computer  Acquaintance  and  Amount  of  
time  Spent  in  Computer  Usage  
Whereas,  with  regard  to  acquaintance  with  computers  among  GJALC  students,  more  number  of  students  69  (54.76  %)  have  said  that  they  are  ‘fairly  experienced  user’  followed  by  23  (18.25  %)  students  ‘more  experienced  users’,  19  (15.08  %)  students  ‘intermediate  users’  and  a  very  negligible  number 15 (11.91 %)of students are ‘beginners’. In  case of LLRCL, a majority of students 45 (66.18 %)  are ‘intermediate’, 10 (14.71 %) students claim they  are  ‘fairly  experienced  user’,  8  (11.76  %)  students  are  ‘beginners’,  and  a  very  negligible  number  of  5  (7.35  %)  students  ‘very  experienced  users’  of  computers. 
It is observed that, highest number of the students  from  each  college  spends  2-3  hours  in  a  day  on  the  computer,  in  that  again  the  rate  of  response  from  LLRCL  is  higher  as  compared  to  GJALC. 
Figure 1 also revealed that nearly equal number  of  students  from  both  colleges  is  beginners  in  the  use of computers. The response rate for the category  ‘intermediate and fairly experienced user’ is scattered  and  unequal  among  both  the  colleges.  Very  less  student  population  is  using  computers  for  ‘more  than 6 hours a day’, however, the response rate is  slightly  higher  in  case  of  GJALC  than  LLRCL. 5.5  Access  to  Paid  and  Free  Online  Legal

Figure 2. Access to paid and free online legal databases. 
It  is  observed  from  the  results  of  the  survey  that the students of both the colleges are accessing  the  paid  legal  databases,  whether  it  could  be  at  home  or  at  the  office  or  at  the  library.  The  rate  of  access  to  Legalpundit  and  Manupatra  databases  is  higher  among  the  students  of  both  the  colleges  and it is significant note that the rate of access by  GJALC  students  is  higher  than  LLRCL.  However,  it  is  pertinent  to  note  that  the  equal  percentage  of  GJALC  students  (i.e.,  20.63  %)  access  both  ‘West  Law  India’  and  ‘West  Law  International’.  Similarly,  equal  percentage  of  LLRCL  students  (i.e.,  4.41  %)   access  ‘West  Law  International’  and  ‘LexisNexis  Academic universe’. 
To  ascertain  the  knowledge  of  the  students  about  free  law  resources,  students  were  asked  a  question  about  the  use  of  free  legal  databases.  There  are  many  students  who  know  free  online  legal  databases.  Both  the  college  students  rated  high  for  IndianKanoon   online  database  (Fig.  2)  and  followed  by  Judis,  Advocate  Khoj  and  LII  of  India.  It  is  observed  from  the  results  of  the  survey  that  the  number  of  students  accessing  the  free  online  resources  is  increased  and  students  are  not  only  aware  about  these  sources  but  are  also  using  them. 
5.6  Mode  of  Awareness  of  Free  Online  
Databases 
Figure 3 reveals that the students get awareness  about free online databases through friends, teachers,  
library  staff,  library  website,  library  blog,  library  brochure.  The  students  from  both  colleges  have  given  the  highest  rating  for  library  blog,  website  and  brochures  in  spreading  the  awareness  about  free  online  legal  resources.  
The responses of the students of both colleges  are nearly equal in all modes of awareness except  library  staff  where  it  is  44.44  %  and  &  22.05  %  from  GJALC  &  LLRCL,  respectively. 
5.7  Opinion  on  Digital resources 
Figure 4 shows that most of the students appreciated  the  digital  resources  w.r.t.  search  facilities,  time  saving,  and  links  to  the  other  sources.  The  figure  unravels the students' positive attitude in embracing  the  technology  in  helping  them  to  conduct  quick  and  accurate  legal  research  with  many  search  facilities and further links to similar subject matter, particularly  in  case  of  searching  case  laws.

5.8  Amount  of  time  Spent  on  Information  
gathering Activity 
Table  5  provides  an  overall  picture  about  the  time spent by the student’s in gathering information.  The  students  said  that  they  spend  ‘up  to  2  hours’  and  ‘5-6  hour’  in  a  week  in  gathering  information,  majority  of  the  respondents  i.e.,  73.01  %  from  GJALC  and  79.41  %  from  LLRCL  spend  their  time  on ‘e-mail alerts and correspondence’ respectively.  The  response  rate  for  these  categories  from  both  colleges  is  very  high  compare  to  other  mode  of  activities as less than 50 % responses are received  for  other  activities. 
5.9  Problem  Faced  while  Seeking  Information 
Table 6 provides the responses received from the  students of both colleges with regard to the probable  problems. The students of the both colleges ‘Often’  face  the  problem  of  the  ‘information  overload  on

It  is  also  observed  from  the  results  of  the  study  that  the  majority  of  them  know  how  to  use  electronic  resources.  However,  the  response  of  the  students  of  both  the  colleges  is  varied  for  ‘information  scattered  in  too  many  sources’  and  ‘low  internet  speed’. 
6. 
FINDINgS 
(a) All the students from both the college visit library  
for issue/refer books thereby it indicates that, still  
students  depend  on  print  resources.  It  is  also  
observed that, more number of GJALC students  
visit the library to use CD-ROM databases and  
online databases than the LLRCL students. More  
significant  to  note  that  most  of  the  students  
from  the  LLRCL  visit  library  to  use  computers  
and  to  use  the  Internet  than  the  students  of  
GJALC. 
(b) All  students  (100  %)  from  both  the  colleges  
use  information  sources  to  keep  themselves  
66 
up-to-date and to prepare for competitions, viz.,  Moot  court,  etc. 
(c) It is observed that, highest number of students  
from  each  college  spends  2-3  hours  in  a  day  
on  the  computer.  But,  very  less  number  of  
students uses computers for ‘more than 6 hours  
a  day’. 
(d) The response rate for the category ‘intermediate  
user’  and  ‘fairly  experienced  user’  is  scattered  
and unequal among both the colleges. A nearly  
equal number of students from both the colleges  
are  beginners. 
(e) The students of both the colleges are accessing  
paid  legal  databases,  whether  it  could  be  at  
home  or  at  the  office  or  at  the  library.  The  
rate  of  access  to  Legalpundit  and  Manupatra  
databases  is  higher  among  the  students  of  
both the colleges. We may attribute this mainly  
because of subscription to these databases by  
both  the  colleges. 
(f) It is significant to note that the equal number of  
GJALC students access both ‘West Law India’  
and  ‘West  Law  International’.  Similarly,  equal  
number  of  students  from  LLRCL  access  ‘West  
Law  International’  and  ‘LexisNexis  Academic  
universe’. 
(g) There are many students who know free online  
legal  databases.  Both  the  college  students  
rated  high  for  IndianKanoon  online  database  
and  followed  by  Judis,  Advocate  Khoj  and  LII  
of  India.  It  is  observed  from  the  results  of  the  
survey  that  the  increasing  number  of  students  
is  accessing  free  online  resources,  they  are  
not only aware of these sources but also using  
them. 
(h) The  students  get  awareness  about  free  online  
databases through friends, teachers, library staff,  
library  website,  library  blog,  library  brochure.  
The  students  from  both  colleges  have  given  
the  highest  rating  for  library  blog,  website  and  
brochures  in  spreading  the  awareness  about  
free  online  legal  resources. 
(i) 
Most  of  the  students  appreciated  the  digital  resources with respect to search facilities, time  saving,  and  links  to  the  other  sources.  This  shows  that,  the  students'  positive  attitude  in  embracing the technology. Further, the majority  of  students  from  both  colleges  spend  time  in  information gathering on ‘e-mail alerts and e-mail  correspondence’,  browsing  e-journals  on  the  internet,  using  social  network  sites,  accessing  e-books,  etc.

KADLI  & H ANCHINAL: INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIOuR OF LAW STuDENTS IN THE CHANGING DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT 
7. 
CONCLUSIONS AND rECOMMENDAtIONS 
The  study  revealed  that  the  law  students  use  IT-based library sources and facilities more frequently  along with printed sources. Similarly, it is also noted  that e-mail is the most  popular  internet  application  used by the students, whereas other Internet-based  services and applications are used moderately. This  is  a  matter  of  concern,  as  presently,  electronic  information sources and the Internet are considered  extremely  important  tools  for  effective  teaching,  learning  and  research.  Therefore,  both  the  college  libraries  need  to  review  its  policy  on  electronic  information  resources.Generally,  students  depend  upon  a  variety  of  information  sources  to  complete  assignments,  project  work,  journal  writing  and  for  the exams. The students of both the colleges ‘often’  face  the  problem  of  the  ‘information  overload  on  internet’  and  ‘Lack  of  information  skills  to  search’.  Therefore,  library  staff  should  be  trained  to  render  quality  services  and  train  users  to  find  the  needed  information  on  their  own. 
To  improve  the  services  and  facilities  of  the  library it is recommended that the libraries shall adopt  the  practice  of  taking  feedback  from  the  users  by  circulating an online questionnaire which will certainly  help strengthen the library resources and services.  Finally,  it  is  suggested  that  the  law  librarians  need  to work in collaboration with the teaching faculty to  influence  students'  information  seeking  behaviour  by  re-evaluating  the  collection  development  policy,  instructional  programmes,  services  and  facilities  based  on  the  needs  of  the  current  users.
