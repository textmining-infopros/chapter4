Bradford’s law is about scattering of literature in different information sources on a narrow subject.  The present study serves as a test of the two formulations of Bradford’s law, verbal and graphical, using  137120 articles published on Human-computer interaction (HCI) research in the journals index in Science  Citation Index-Expanded during 1987-2011. The data is divided into fve fve-year spans so that comparisons  can be made between the percentage errors for each fve-year period. List of the core journals is also  prepared for all the fve blocks of fve-year period. Number of journals and their titles in the core group  indicates continuous change in focus in HCI research from one fve-year block to the next. In addition,  the applicability of Leimkuhler model was also tested with the present data. Neither the verbal nor the  graphical formulation provides results that are consistent with the practical situation.

1. IntRoduCtIon 
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is defined as  ‘a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation,  and  implementation  of  computing  systems  for  human use and with the study of major phenomena  surrounding  them’1.  ‘HCI  can  be  viewed  as  two  powerful information processors (human and computer)  attempting  to  communicate  with  each  other’2.  The  HCI  focuses  on  the  interactions  between  human  users  and  computer  systems,  including  the  user  interface  and  the  underlying  processes  which  produce the interactions. The contributing disciplines  include computer science, cognitive science, human  factors, software engineering, management science,  psychology,  sociology,  and  anthropology.  ‘Early  research  and  development  in  HCI  was  on  issues  directly  related  to  the  user  interface.  Some  typical  issues  were  the  properties  of  various  input  and  output  devices,  interface  learnability  for  new  users  versus  efficiency  and  extensibility  for  experienced  users, and the appropriate combination of interaction  components  such  as  command  languages,  menus,  and graphical user interfaces. Recently, the field of  HCI  has  broadened  and  become  more  attentive  to  the  processes  and  context  for  the  user  interface.  The  focus  of  research  and  development  is  now  on  understanding  the  relationships  among  users'  goals and objectives, their personal capabilities, the  social environment, and the designed artifacts with 
which  they  interact.  As  an  applied  field,  it  is  also  concerned  with  the  development  processes  used  to  create  the  interactive  system  and  their  values  for  the  human  user’3.

The intellectual base of any discipline is revealed  in  its  journal  literature,  which  serves,  among  other  things,  as  a  vehicle  for  disseminating  information,  introducing  innovations,  and  reporting  the  findings  of research in the field4. However, ‘the proliferation  of  journals  and  the  consequent  exponential  growth  of  journal  literature  have  laterally  jeopardised  their  capacity  to  transmit  information  effectively  and  rapidly’5. Bradford6  was first to observe a pattern in  scattering of journal productivity of a given subject.  Bradford’s law of scattering is based on the principle  that every scientific field is related, however remotely,  to every other field. The verbal formulation Bradford's  law  states  that  “If  scientific  journals  are  arranged  in  order  of  decreasing  productivity  of  articles  on  a  given subject, they may be divided into a nucleus of  periodicals more particularly devoted to the subject,  and  several  groups  or  zones  containing  the  same  number of articles as the nucleus, where the number  of periodicals in the nucleus and succeeding zones  will  be  in  a  ratio  of  l  :  n  :  n2.  The  constant  n  is  the  property  of  the  collection  of  periodicals  called  the Bradford multiplier. The graphical formulation of  Bradford’s  law  is  obtained  by  plotting  a  curve  in  a

is  called  as  ‘Bradford  Bibliograph’.  ‘Bradford’s  law  out  to  test  the  applicability  of  Bradford’s  law  to  has been used as an argument about how to build  literature related to various field of sciences. Some  collections,  how  to  select  journals  to  be  indexed  of the recent studies are mentioned here. Sudhier22 in  bibliographies,  how  to  measure  the  coverage  carried  out  a  study  on  five-year  data  of  journals  of  bibliographies,  how  to  solve  practical  problems  (2004-2008)  cited  by  the  physicists  at  the  Indian  
related  to  information  seeking  and  retrieval.’7 
Bradford8  examined two bibliographies prepared in  the Science Library (Britain) on Applied Geophysics  (1928-1931) and Lubrication (1932-1937). He identified  three groups of periodicals in the list of periodicals  
Institute  of  Science  to  examine  the  applicability  of  Bradford’s law of scattering, from 79 doctoral theses  during  the  period  2004-08.  The  journal  distribution  pattern did not fit the Bradford’s distribution pattern.  Wardikar  &  Gudadhe23   carried  out  a  study  on  the

approximately  the  same  number  of  articles  on  the  subject,  but  the  number  of  periodicals  in  these  three equi-productive zones increased by a constant  factor.  Vickery9   extended  the  verbal  formulation  to  show  that  it  can  be  applied  to  any  number  of  zones  of  equal  yield,  not  to  only  the  three  zones  that  Bradford  had  used  for  his  data.  Stevens10 found  in  Chemistry  that  2  journals  were  needed  to  cover 25 %, 7 to cover 50 % and 24 to cover 75 %  of  the  total  247  journals  covering  3633  citations.  Leimkuhler11  suggested a model based on Bradford’s  law  of  scattering  and  it  is  called  the  Bradford’s  distribution. Brookes12 also derived a formula which  does  not  depend  on  groupings  of  journal  titles.  Gross13 observed a droop while plotting the data on  the  journal  literature  of  Physics.  The  droop  refers  to the shape of some Bradford’s curves at their tail  ends.  The  curve  shows  a  downward  deviation  at  the end of the log-linear portion. This phenomenon  is  known  as  the  ‘Gross  droop’.

 showed that Bradford’s law  held  good  for  literature,  dispersion  in  the  field  of  transplantation-immunology for the years 1965-1968,  as well as periodical circulation in a medical library.  Chakraborthy15  studied the scatter of Indian geological  literature in Indian and foreign periodicals and found  that about 90 % of the literature is covered in Indian  sources.  Garvey16   pointed  out  that  authors  would  seek  to  publish  their  articles  in  certain  journals  and  not  in  others.  Eto17   tested  the  applicability  of  the  Bradford’s  law  to  firms  expending  on  the  R&D  and  successfully  identified  core  firms,  peripheral  firms,  and  minor  firms.  Brookstein18   observed  the  multidisciplinary character of journals and defined a  simple model that indicates the evaluation of journals  as  a  competition  among  subjects  for  space.  Rao19  pointed  out  that  value  of  Bradford  multipliers  vary  from  zone  to  zone.  Bandopadhyay20   studied  the  scatter  of  journal  literature  in  different  disciplines  for  the  period  1981  to  1990.  Egghe21   has  given  ‘a

at the universities in Maharashtra for their doctoral  research  in  the  field  of  library  and  information  science from 1982-2010. Annals of Library Science  and Documentation  took top place with 207 citations  followed  by  College  and  Research  Libraries   with  184  citations  and  Herald  of  Library  Science   with  160 citations were the most preferred journals. Ram  &  Paliwal24   applied  Bradford’s  law  of  scattering  to  the Psoriasis literature published during 1960-2009  and  found  that  theoretical  aspect  of  Bradford  law  did  not  fit,  but  the  Leimkuhler  model  holds  good  for  Psoriasis  literature.

Data for the present study is downloaded using  principal  keywords  related  to  HCI  research  from  Science  Citation  Index-Expanded  for  the  period  1987-2011.  The  data  were  divided  into  five  data  sets  of  five-year  period  blocks,  i.e.,  1987-1991,  1992-1996,  1997-2001,  2002-2006  and  2007-2011.  Journal  titles  were  sorted  in  descending  order  of  productivity. The verbal formulation of the Bradford’s  Law  of  Scattering  is  tested  by  dividing  the  total  number  of  articles  in  each  field  into  three  zones.  To  test  the  graphical  formulation  of  the  Bradford’s  law,  Bradford  bibliograph  were  plotted  for  each  period  block. 
Leimkuhler11   developed  a  model  based  on  Bradford’s  verbal  formulation  as:

In  forming  Bradford  groups,  it  is  shown  that  the  number  of  groups  ‘p’  is  a  parameter  that  can  be  chosen  freely. 
Once  p  is  determined  the  value  of  k  is:  
k  =  (eγym)  1/p             (4) where, γ   is  Euler’s  number  ( eγ   =  1.781  )

relationship  of  each  zone  as  19  :  56  :  239.    Here,  19 represent the number of periodicals in the nucleus  and  n  =  4.25  is  a  multiplier.  The  mean  value  of  multipliers  is  (3.0+4.3)/2=3.7.

each zone increases by a multiplier of 3.75. Similar  trend  in  observed  in  case  of  data  relating  to  time  period  1997-2001  and  2007-2011  with  percentage  error  of  1.2  %  and  2.9  %  respectively.  whereas,  the  percentage  error  during  the  five-year  period  blocks of 1992-1996 and 2002-2006, is significantly  higher  at  9.5  %  and  6.6  %  respectively.  
It  is  clear  from  Table  1  to  Table  5  that  there  are  very  small  number  of  journals  in  the  nucleus  and  they  are  the  most  productive  journals  devoted  to  HCI  research  ranging  from  3.6  %  during  1997- 2001  and  6.1  %  during  1992-1996  and  2007-2011,  of  total  journals  in  the  respective  five-year  blocks.  The second zone is represented by a large number  of  journals  which  share  17.8  %  during  1992-1996  and 20.7 % during 1987-1991 of total cited journals  and  the  last  zone  is  represented  by  around  80  %  of  total  cited  journals  for  all  the  five  year  blocks.  Each  zone  has  approximately  one  third  (1/3)  of  the  total  citations.  Hence,  the  journal  distribution  as  per  the  Bradford’s  law  reveals  that  there  is  a  large difference in Bradford multiplier for the period  block  of  1992-1996  as  compared  to  the  other  period  blocks. Although,  difference  in  the  Bradford  multiplier  for  other  year  blocks  is  much  less,  it  is  still  far  from  the  ideal  one.      
5.2 graphical formulation 
The  graphical  approach  was  developed  by  Brookes25  which tries to verify the verbal formulation  of  the  Bradford’s  law.  The  graph  should  display

Then  a  big  portion  of  linear  rise,  and  is  a  multiplier.  The  mean  value  of  multipliers  is  
(3.0+4.0)/2=3.5. 
Therefore, 1 : n : n2  :: 29 : 29 x 3.5 : 29 x 3.52  
        ::  29  :  101.5  :  355.3  »  485.8 
The  percentage  error  =  ((472-485.8)/472)*100 
                           = 2.9 % 
The  percentage  error  for  the  initial  period  of  1987-1991  is  negligible.  It  is  also  observed  that,  the number of periodicals contributing references to

(iii) A  ‘droop’  towards  the  tail,  Brookes  argued  that  
droop was an indication of the incomplete nature  
of  the  bibliography  examined. 
Figures  1-5  give  the  ‘Bradford  Bibliograph’,  for  HCI  research  literature  for  five  five-year  period  blocks,  i.e.,  1987-1991,  1992-1996,  1997-2001,  2002-2006, and 2007-2011. All the five graphs have  clearly  displayed  the  three  distinct  regions.

5.3 Appilcation  of  Leimkuhler  Model 
Leimkuhler’s  model  is  applied  on  the  data  on  all the HCI research for five five-year period blocks.  K-S goodness-of-fit statistical test is applied to assert  that  the  observed  productivity  distribution  is  not  significantly different from a theoretical distribution.  K-S test compares cumulative observed and cumulative  expected  frequencies  of  productivity  distribution.  The  maximum  deviation  between  the  cumulative

proportions of the observed and theoretical frequency  is  determined  by  the  following  formula: 
D max F Fmax =− 
0 e 
     where,   F0  is the theoretical cumulative frequency;  and Fe  is the observed cumulative frequency. 
The  K-S  test  is  performed  at  0.01  level  of  significance.  Results  of  the  K-S  test  are  given  in  Table  6.  For  all  the  five  period  blocks,  the  D value  is  more  than  the  tabled  K-S  value  at  the max 0.01  level  of  significance  and  hence  Leimkuhler’s  model  has  not  been  able  to  explain  the  scattering  of  journal  productivity  in  HCI  literature.

Recognition;  etc.  When  these  titles  are  compared  with  list  of  core  journals  for  the  earlier  periods,  it  is  observed  that  these  journals  have  been  going  up  steadily  in  the  rank  list.  So,  it  can  implied  that  the  field  of  HCI  research  is  evolving  continuously  and  that  its  focus  is  shifting  over  different  periods  of  the  study.    
6. ConCLusIons  
‘The  principal  application  of  Bradford's  Law  is  probably only in organising and presenting data on  subject literatures, for example, for the evaluation of  search results, for the comparative study of subjects,  and  for  scientometric  investigations.’26   The  journal  distribution pattern of the HCI research during 1992- 1996  and  2002-2006  does  not  fit  the  Bradford’s  distribution pattern, i.e., 1 : n : n2  as the percentage  of  error  is  very  high  (6.6  %  and  11.3  %).  For  the  period  blocks  of  1987-1991,  percentage  error  is  negligible at 0.05 %. For block period of 1997-2001  and  2007-2011,  the  percentage  error  is  1.2  %  and  2.9 % respectively, which is not significant. Bradford’s  multipliers have different values for different zones  as  well  as  different  data  sets.  This  is  consistent  with  Roa’s19   view,  that  Bradford’s  multipliers  vary  from  zone  to  zone.  It  is  also  observed  from  the  Bradford  multiplier  that  the  number  of  journal  in  each zone is not increasing geometrically. Hence, it  is  concluded  that  the  dispersion  of  journal  titles  in  HCI literature does not satisfy the verbal formulation  of  Bradford’s  law  of  scattering.  
From  the  Figs.  1-5,  it  is  found  that  the  data  in  HCI  literature  for  the  entire  five  five-year  period  blocks, have an initial raising curve and followed by  linearity, except towards the end showing a ‘droop’  characteristic of incomplete data. This droops have  also  been  reported  by Afloabi27   for  library  science  literature.  Leimkuhler  model  has  failed  to  explain  journal  productivity  distribution  in  the  field  HCI  research, as values of Dmax  is much higher than the  K-S  critical  values  for  all  the  five  data  sets.  
Core  journals  of  all  five  five-year  period  block  are listed in Appendix I. The number of core journals  is increased from 10 during 1987-1991 to 29 during  2007-2011. This indicates the gradual expansion of  the  field  HCI  research.  Careful  examination  of  the  titles  of  sources  indicates  a  constant  shift  in  the  focus  of  the  literature  in  the  field  of  HCI  research.  This has a the implication that extreme care should  be  taken  while  deciding  the  core  journals  for  a  narrow subject, otherwise it could lead to a selection  sources  which  are  not  in  use  currently. 
From the above discussion it is concluded that  the journal usage pattern in HCI literature does fully  satisfy either the verbal or the graphical formulation  of  the  Bradford’s  law  of  scattering.  This  may  be  due  to  the  heavy  concentration  of  articles  in  a  few  journals.  The  productivity  of  journals  in  HCI  
228 
literature  shows  the  concentration  of  more  number  of  articles  in  a  few  journals.
