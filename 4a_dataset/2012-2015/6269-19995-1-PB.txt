This research was focused on examining the extent of use and the attitude of undergraduate (UG)  students towards the use of electronic information resources (EIRs).  It aimed to establish the relationship  between UG students’ attitude and their use of EIRs in university libraries in South-West, Nigeria. The  descriptive as well as correlational survey design was adopted for the study. The purposive and proportionate  stratifed random sampling techniques were employed in selecting the study population and sample size  while questionnaire and oral interview were used as instruments for data collection. The fndings revealed  that EIRs are not adequately utilised as the UG students have negative attitude towards its use. They  assume  that  additional  special  computing  skills  are  required  before  one  can  be  competent  enough  to  effectively utilise these resources. The study also established that there is signifcant relationship between  UG students’ attitude and their use of EIRs provided in the library and also provides practical insights  into the consequences of having negative attitude towards the use of libraries’ EIRs. Recommendations  geared towards ameliorating the problems were also made.

University education system in Africa and specifically;  Nigeria, is developing and advancing both in number  and  absorption  of  technologies  into  its  teaching,  learning,  and  research  processes.  The  university  libraries as the nerve centre of the institutions have  equally joined the universal bandwagon in providing  electronic  information  resources  (EIRs)  to  their  users with the aim of enhancing the academic and  research activities that go on in the institutions and  also meet up with the global trends and standards.  Globally,  the  pattern  of  library  and  information  services provision to users is dramatically changing  resulting  from  the  absorption  and  utilisation  of  IT  with  its  accompanying  EIRs.  Library  users  are  no  longer compelled to physically visit the library before  services  are  rendered  to  them.  The  advent  and  availability of EIRs now enable them to have remote  access  to  the  libraries’  resources  and  services. 
The  EIRs  in  the  context  of  this  work  are  those  library  resources  that  can  only  be  accessed  via  the  use  of  computing  devices  such  as  computers,  tablets,  and  smart  phones.  These  resources  have

indeed  become  more  important  for  the  academic  community  in  accessing  up-to-date  information  at  the  right  time  and  in  the  right  form.  They  enable  students  to  have  access  to  first-hand  information  characterised  by  being  timely,  current,  easy  to  access  and,  even  from  remote  places  and  also  open  up  the  possibility  of  searching  multiple  files  at  a  time,  a  feat  accomplished  more  easily  than  when  using  printed  equivalents.  
Attitude  of  student  towards  EIRs  use  on  the  other hand is conceptualised in this study as those  reactions to e-resources and services use by students,  resulting  from  assumptions,  perceptions,  beliefs  and, other people’s opinions. In the terms of Burns,  cited by Alkhanak & Azmi1, ‘attitudes’ is defined as  evaluated beliefs which predispose the individual to  respond in a preferential way. It is a predisposition  to act based on assumption, a state of readiness to  act  based  on  past  experience,  or  a  predisposition  to  act  based  on  evaluations.  Presently,  EIRs  has  become an integral part of higher education learning  and  research.  Given  the  increased  availability  and  provision of EIRs in university libraries, it is important

to  understand  how  the  attitudes  of  students  are  affecting  the  use  of  these  resources.

The provision of   EIRs  in  university  libraries  is  now a global phenomenon. This prevailed based on  the  numerous  benefits  associated  with  the  use  of  these  resources  which  include:  provision  of  timely,  current,  remote,  and  global  access  to  information.  Already existing body of literature such as ones by  Tella2, et al. , Negahban & Talawar3  also established  that the use of EIRs positively influences the academic  performance  of  students.  Consequent  upon  these  benefits associated with the use of EIRs alongside  the  need  to  maintain  global  standard,  Nigerian  university  libraries,  notwithstanding  their  meagre  budget  allocations,  have  made  frantic  efforts  to  acquire  EIRs  for  their  users.  However,  literature,  personal observation and pre-research discussions  with librarians in many university libraries in Nigeria  have  revealed  that  EIRs  are  grossly  under-utilised  by  UG  students. This  situation  could  give  room  for  one to begin to ruminate and wonder on the quality,  coverage and relevance of knowledge being utilised  by  the  UG  students  within  the  universities  as  well  as  what  the  future  holds  for  them  considering  the  global  trend  concerning  information  provision  and  access in this electronic age. More so, considering  the  fact  that  positive  attitude  towards  the  use  of  these resources could influence effective utilisation,  one  then  is  compelled  to  ask  such  questions  as:  Could  this  be  a  resultant  effect  of  the  attitudes  of  the  students  towards  the  use  of  these  resources?;  How do they perceive the use of these resources?;  Do  they  see  these  EIRs  as  useful  resources? 
Presently, little is known about students’ attitude  towards  the  use  of  EIRs  in  university  libraries  in  South-West Nigeria. While studies on EIRs utilisation  abound  in  the  literature,  none  specifically  explored  the relationship between students’ attitude towards  EIRs  use  and  their  actual  use  of  these  resources  in  this  geo-political  zone  in  Nigeria.  The  need  to  fill  this  gap  in  knowledge  and  also  find  solution  to  the  EIRs  under-utilisation  problem  propelled  the  researchers  into  conducting  this  study  which  focuses  on  determining  the  relationship  between  the  attitudes  of  undergraduate  (UG)  students  and  their  use  of  these  resources.

The main objective of this study is to establish  UG  students’  attitude  as  a  determining  factor  to  their  use  of  EIRs  in  university  libraries  in  South- West,  Nigeria.  
The  specific  objectives  are  to: 
(a) Examine  the  UG  students’  attitudes  towards  
the  use  of  EIRs  in  the  university  libraries  in  
South-West  Nigeria. 
334 
(b) Establish  the  extent  of  use  of  the  university  
libraries’  EIRs  by  the  UG  students  in  South- 
West  Nigeria. 
(c) Hypothetically determine the relationship between  
the  UG  students’  attitude  towards  (especially  
in  respect  to  their  assumption,  beliefs  and  
perception  of  the  resources)  the  use  of  EIRs  
and  their  actual  use  of  these  resources  in  the  
university  libraries  under  study. 
4.  HypotHESIS 
The null hypothesis provided below guided the  conduct  of  this  study  and  it  is  tested  at  p=0.05  level  of  significance 
Ho1–  Attitudes  of  UG  students  towards  EIRs  use  do  not  significantly  relate  with  their  actual  use  in  the  university  libraries. 
5.  ScopE   o F   t HE   St UDy 
This  study  is  focused  on  UG  students  in  all  the  universities  in  South-West,  Nigeria.  This  zone  is  selected  based  on  the  outcome  of  a  preliminary  investigation  which  revealed  that  greater  numbers  of  university  libraries  with  Internet  access  and  e-resources  subscription  are  located  in  this  geo- political  zone.  The  study  is  also  restricted  to  the  use of EIRs (e-journals, e-books, online databases  and the internet) provided by the libraries only. The  use  of  EIRs  in  cybercafés  or  commercial  business  centres  is  not  covered  in  this  study.  The  reason  for this is based on the fact that university libraries  are  established  to  provide  free  discipline-oriented  EIRs  specifically  targeted  at  satisfying  the  overall  academic  needs  of  the  university  hence,  non  use  or under-utilisation will not be attributed to financial  cost  of  use.  
6.    RE vIEW   o F LItERAtURE 
Attitude  is  an  important  variable  to  consider  in  the  study  of  human  behaviour  and  vital  concept  in  the use of libraries’ EIRs by UG students. Attitude,  as  a  hypothetical  construct,  represents  individual’s  likes or dislike for an item. Ajzen & Fishbein4  defined  attitudes  as  the  positive  or  negative  evaluation  of  object,  people,  or  situation  that  predisposes  us  to  feel and behave toward them in positive or negative  ways. Anastasi5   defines  attitude  as  a  tendency  to  react favourably or unfavourably towards a designated  class of stimuli.  An individual’s attitude towards an  object  or  issue  can  be  deduced  from  his  behavior  in  situations  involving  that  object.  If  a  person  has  negative  attitude  towards  an  issue,  the  expected  outcome  is  unpleasant  feeling.  
Babalola & Olapegba6  acknowledged that most  attitudes  are  results  of  observational  learning  from  the environment. This implies that students’ attitude  therefore may result from observing fellow students

being frustrated in the search for information using the  electronic medium. Loewenstein7  aver that attitude could  be positive, negative or neutral view or behaviours  of  a  person.  The  implication  is  that,  if  a  person  has  negative  attitude  towards  the  use  of  EIRs  the  expected outcome is already known. He will either not  utilise  it  at  all  or  utili  se  it  just  once  in  a  while. 
Undergraduate students may be competent but  may  lack  the  desire  to  use  the  library  resources  which explains Babalola & Olapegba6   findings  that  the  characteristics  of  the  undergraduate  students  like  personality,  past  experiences,  values,  habits,  needs  may  all  influence  their  perceptual  process  of  the  library.  An  individual  can  be  competent  and  possess  all  the  skills  required  to  effectively  utilise  a  resource  such  as  EIRs  but  fails  to  do  so  because of lack of desire resulting possibly from the  person’s  perception  or  belief  about  that  resource.  Tella8  discovers that attitude develops as a result of  perception and that attitude also affects perception.  He  further  stated  that  though  UGs  may  perceive  the  usefulness  of  the  library  resources,  the  ease  of  use  and  the  enthusiasm  affects  their  use  of  the  resources.  In  addition,  Kakai9,  et  al .  stated  that  user’s perceptions of the library and its programmes  and  resources  also  act  as  an  intervening  variable  to  information  utilisation  in  the  library.  
The  EIRs  are  inseparable  part  of  today’s  educational  system.  This  is  because  e-resources  have exploded in popularity and use resulting from  the numerous gains of timeliness, ease of use, up- to-datedness  and  remote  access  associated  with  their  use.  However,  effective  use  of  the  EIRs  by  UG students could be influenced by their attitudes,  which could be positive or negative. Okello-Obura &  Magara10  conducted a study on Electronic Information  access  and  utilisation  by  Makerere  University  in  Uganda.  The  findings  were  analysed  using  simple  descriptive  Statistics  (frequency  and  percentage).   The  findings  revealed  that  the  respondents  have  positive  attitude  towards  the  use  of  EIRs  as  80  %  and another 72 % of them disagreed simultaneously  with  the  statements  that  “Given  the  opportunity  to  choose between e-resources and printed resources  at  Makerere  University  to  do  my  coursework  and  research,  I  would  choose  printed  materials”  and  “I  can avoid EIRs and still perform well in my academic  work”.  It  also  revealed  that  majority  (72  %)  of  the  respondents strongly feel that the standard of their  academic  work  would  suffer  without  e-resources.   
Safdar11, et al . aimed to find out the frequency of  
Sam12, et al . found in their study found that UG  students  had  better  attitudes  toward  the  internet   and  did  more  downloading  of  software  and  games  activities. 
Mulla13   on  the  use  of  e-resources  by  faculty  members in HkBk  College of Engineering was carried  out with 60 faculty members. Questionnaire was used as  instrument for data collection. The findings revealed that  out of 60 respondents, 16 (26.67 %) faculty members  use the e-resources 'once in a week', followed by 15  (25  %)  who  are  using  it  'daily',  whereas,  18.33 % of faculty members use 'occasionally' and  only  5  %  of  members    never  used  the  electronic  resources  in  the  library. 
Edem  &  Ofre14   in  their  study  on  reading  and  internet  use  activities  of  UG  students  of  the  University of Calabar, Nigeria, adopted a descriptive  survey  design  and  the  random  sampling  technique  was  used  to  administer  200  copies  of  a  designed  questionnaire  to  the  UG  students  of  the  university  who  used  the  university  library  during  April  2009.  133  questionnaire  were  returned  (response  rate  65  %).  The  study  revealed  that  57.1  %  students  responded  that  they  use  the  internet  occasionally;  followed  by  weekly  (21.1  %)  and  bi-weekly  (12  %)  responses  as  against  reading  of  printed  materials  which 63.2 % of the respondent admitted that they  do  on  a  daily  basis.  The  implication  is  that  the  respondents read printed information resources more  often  and  also  for  longer  time  than  they  used  the  Internet  and  other  EIRs. 
A  test  analysis  was  conducted  by  Ibrahim15  to  measure  the  use  of  e-resources  and  detect  factors  that  deter  effective  and  frequent  use.  a criterion of less than 0.05 was used to determine the  significance of use. Frequency of use of e-resources  was  significantly  low  for  most  type  of  e-resources.  The least frequently used e-resources were e-books  (t.=2.10,  p<0.05),  the  online  reference  works  (t.=2.78  p.<0.05)  were  found  to  be  more  popular,  even  though  they  still  fell  below  the  anticipated  frequency  in  the  survey’s  set  mean. 
The  literature  search  failed  to  identify  any  study  that  correlated  UG  students’  attitude  with  their  use  of  EIRs  in  the  university  libraries  in  the  south-west,  geopolitical  zone  of  Nigeria.  This  is  the  gap  in  knowledge  observed  which  this  study  seeks  to  fill.

system  and  are  adopted.  According  to  Rogers,  there  are  five  main  factors  that  influence  adoption  of  an  innovation.  These  are: 
• Relative  Advantage  –  The  degree  to  which  an  
innovation  is  seen  as  better  than  the  idea,  
programme,  or  product  it  replaces. 
• Compatibility  –  How  consistent  the  innovation  
is  with  the  values,  experiences,  and  needs  of  
the  potential  adopters. 
• Complexity  –  This  is  the  degree  to  which  an  
innovation is perceived as difficult to understand  
and use. New ideas that are simpler to understand  
are  adopted  more  rapidly  than  innovations  that  
The  sample  size  of  this  study  therefore  is  (shown  in  Table  1)  1,806  being  5  %  of  the  entire  student  population  in  addition  to  the  12  Librarians  heading  the  electronic  information  section  of  the  selected  libraries.  Questionnaire  and  oral  interview  were  used  for  data  collection.  The  questionnaire  was  administered  on  the  UG  students  while  the  heads  of the EIRs Units of the various university libraries  were  interviewed.  The  interview  outcomes  were  used  to  corroborate  the  results  obtained  from  the  questionnaire.  The  interview  guide  is  as  follows: (a) Are  the  EIRs  provided  in  your  library  readily

understandings.  
• Triability – Extent to which the innovation can be  
tested or experimented with before a commitment  
to  adopt  is  made. 
• Observability – The extent to which the innovation  
provides  tangible  results. 
The  above  implies  that  for  an  innovation  such  as  the  EIRs  to  gain  acceptance  and  also  be  used  by the library users, they must have positive attitude  towards its use by way of perceiving it to be better  than the printed information materials. It should be  seen  to  be  consistent  with  the  values  and  needs  of  the  library  users  and  also  very  easy  to  use.  In  other  words,  students’  perception  and  belief  about  the  usefulness  and  ease  of  use  of  an  innovation  such  as  EIRs  could  motivate  them  into  utilising  them.

The  descriptive  as  well  as  the  correlational  survey  design  were  adopted  for  this  study.  The  descriptive  design  was  adopted  to  cover  objective  (a)  and  (b),  while  the  correlational  design  was  adopted  for  the  hypothesis  which  is  focused  on  establishing the relationship between the UG students’  attitude  towards  EIRs  use  and  their  actual  use  of  these  resources  in  the  libraries.

9.1 Attitude  of  Ug   Students  towards  the  Use  
of  Libraries’  EIRs 
To  determine  the  attitude  of  the  UG  students  towards the use of the EIRs provided in the university  
libraries,  the  respondents  were  asked  to  identify  from  a  list  of  statements  the  ones  that  reveal  their  attitudes  towards  the  use  of  these  resources.  The  result  is  presented  in  Table  2.  
It revealed that only 3 items (item numbers: 3,  4 and 5) out of the entire 12 items have their mean  scores greater than 2.5 which is the average acceptable  mean score. The other 9 items (items number: 1, 2,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10,  11  and  12)  have  low  mean  scores  (i.e.,  1.98,  2.09,  2.27,  1.80,  1.77,  1.58,  1.92,  2.40,  1.92  and  2.01  respectively),  showing  that  the  UG  students do not have positive attitudes towards the  use  of  the  EIRs  in  the  library.  Generally,  the  total  mean score for all the items provided in this table is  2.01.  This  overall  means  score  which  is  below  2.5  revealed that the UG students have negative attitude  towards  the  use  of  the  EIRs  in  the  library.  
The interview outcome also corroborated with the  findings from the questionnaire. The librarians heading  the unit in-charge of these resources informed that  the  UG  students  generally  have  negative  attitudes  towards the use of these resources. They explained

Learning  to  use  EIRs  has  been  fascinating  to  me I  fnd  using  EIRs  more  easily  than  using  printed  resources I  appreciate  using  EIRs  for  my  academic  works I see the use of EIRs as rele- vance for academic purposes. I am convinced that the use of  EIRs in the library will enhance  my  academic  performance I  prefer  using  the  library  catalogue  cards  to  OPAC Augmenting  my  lecturer’s  notes  and  handouts  with  the  use  of  library’s  e-resources  seems  relevant  to  me.  The  search  method  for  EIRs  does  not  make  its  use  interesting  to  me Using  EIRs  is  not  as  exciting  as  using  printed  resources My  friends’  experience  with  the use of library’s EIRs does  not encourage me to use them I  consider  the  use  of  the  library’s EIRs as time wasting I  think  the  use  of  library’s  EIRs  is  too  technical  for  me  to  understand

that  these  students  are  so  impatient  and  see  the  use of these resources to be frustrating. According  to the librarians, majority of the UG students prefer  to  use  the  printed  resources  as  they  believe  that  the  use  of  EIRs  require  the  acquisition  of  special  additional  computing  and  technical  skills.  
9.2 Extent  of  Use  of  University  Libraries’  EIRs 
To establish the extent of use of these resources  by  the  UG  students,  options  were  provided  in  the  questionnaire  indicating  the  various  academic  purposes for which UG students could likely utilise  the  resources. The  respondents  were  requested  to  indicate  the  options  that  are  applicable  to  them.  Their  responses  were  provided  in  Table  3.

Table  3  revealed  that  items  1,  2,  3,  8,  11,  and  13,  have  their  mean  scores  greater  than  2.5  (i.e.,  2.58, 2.56, 2.52, 2.54, 2.51, and 2.54, respectively),  which  is  the  average  acceptable  mean  score.  This  implies that the purposes indicated in those numbers  are  the  only  academic  purposes  for  which  the  UG  students  utilise  the  ERs  in  the  libraries.  The  other  10  academic  purposes  presented  in  numbers  4,  5,  6,  7,  9,  10,  12,  14  and  15  had  their  mean  scores  less  than  2.5    showing  that  the  resources  are  not  being used for the purposes represented. Meanwhile,  the overall mean score for all the items provided is  calculated  at  1.93  which  implies  that  the  EIRs  are  not  adequately  utilised  by  the  UG  students.

UkaCHI, et al.: STUDENTS’ ATTITUDES AS A DETERMINING FACTOR TO E-INFORMATION RESOURCES USE 
Similarly, the interview outcomes with the librarians  heading  the  electronic  information  units  of  the  various  libraries  indicated  that  the  UG  students  do  not  effectively  utilise  the  EIRs  in  the  libraries. 
To substantiate the null hypothetical statement,  Pearson’s  Product  Moment  Correlation  test  was  carried  out  to  determine  the  relationship  between  UG students’ attitudes towards the use of EIRs and  their actual use of these resources in the university  libraries  under  study.  The  result  is  presented  in  Table  4. 
Table 4 revealed that the correlation coefficient  value of the relationship existing between UG students’  attitude  towards  the  use  of  EIRs  provided  in  the  library  and  their  actual  use  of  these  resources  is  0.742. This value indicates a significant relationship  between UG students’ attitudes and their use of EIRs  in the library and by extension implies that the attitude  of  the  UG  students  towards  the  use  of  EIRs  can  severely  influence  their  use  of  these  resources.

are simpler to understand are adopted more rapidly  than innovations that require the adopter to develop  new  skills  and  understandings  might  have  played  a  role  in  this  circumstance.  
Furthermore, the result also revealed that attitude  of UG students towards the use of EIRs is significantly  related  to  their  actual  use  of  these  resources.  It  is  also  found  out  from  the  study  that  UG  students  in  South-Western  zone  of  Nigeria  have  negative  attitude towards the use of libraries’ EIRS. This could  account  for  why  EIRs  is  grossly  under-utilised  by  the  UG  students  in  South-west;  geo-political  zone  in Nigeria. It confirmed the postulation by Martin &  Metcalfe19   that  an  individual’s  attitude  to  an  object  or  issue  is  always  related  to  the  expected  result  associated with that object or issue and the expected  outcome of a positive attitude is a pleasant feeling  or  result.  The  findings  of  this  study  suggest  that  attitude formation among the UG students could be  due  to  several  factors  like  perception,  conception  and  misconception  of  the  unique  importance  of  the  use  of  libraries’  EIRs  in  their  academics  and  research.  It  is  important  to  note  here  that  naivety  and wrong value system in UG students makes the  use  of  EIRs  in  the  library  secondary.  This  finding  is also in corroboration with Ukachi’s20   finding  that  submission  or  misconception  arises  because  UGs  are  not  familiar  with  the  library  resources  and  services  and  so  they  develop  a  lack  a  daisical  attitude  towards  the  resources  use.  
The  interview  outcomes  also  substantiated  the  result  obtained  from  the  questionnaire  that  the  UG  students do not effectively utilise the EIRs. The EIRs  
The  findings  revealed  that  these  EIRs  are  
are mostly patronised by PG students who basically  
generally inadequately utilised. For instance, out of  
use  them  for  research  purposes.  It  was  gathered  
the  15  options  provided  to  measure  the  extent  of  
from the interview that the students see information  use  of  the  libraries’  EIRs,  only  6  received  positive  
retrieval in the e-platform to be more complex than  responses. These included: To source materials for  
accessing them in prints. This perception of difficulty  research writing/project, to do class assignment, to  
in accessing needed information could be part of the  augment my class works, to retrieve current literature  
factors  responsible  for  the  under-utilisation  of  the  for  studies,  etc.  Other  academic  purposes  such  
university libraries’ EIRs. It could be resulting from  as:  Using  it  to  source  scholarship  and  internship  
the  fact  that  the  students  are  not  given  adequate  opportunities; follow blog discussions on subject areas orientation and training on the use of the resources  of  interest;  participate  in  professional  discussion  
because  of  inadequate  time  provision  for  such  in  group/listserve; using the electronic catalogue (OPAC)  
the  students’  lecture  schedule.  The  implication  of  for sourcing information in the library, etc, were not  
the  foregoing  is  that  these  students  rely  mainly  on  accepted as reasons for using the resources.  This  
printed materials which most often are not regularly  
result  corroborates  Emerole  &  Ogugua’s17   finding  in  their  library  use  study  which  revealed  that  there  is  low  patronage  of  library  services  especially  in  the  area  of  use  of  EIRs.  Similarly,  another  study  conducted  in  the  northern  part  of  Nigeria  by  Issa,  Blessing  &  Daura18   also  found  out  that  only  few  of  their  entire  respondents  utilise  the  EIRs  in  their  library. This could be attributed to perceive unease  of  use  as  well  as  the  assumption  that  additional  new  computing  skills  need  to  be  developed  before  one  can  be  capable  of  effectively  utilising  the  resources. The general believe that new ideas that  
updated  like  their  e-counterparts  hence,  might  be  utilising obsolete information. It is also important to  note  that  inadequate  utilisation  of  these  resources  by  the  UG  students  could  limit  their  knowledge  and  narrow  their  horizon  in  their  specific  subject  areas thus, rendering them incapable of competing  favourably  with  their  counterparts  globally.  
11.  REcommENDAtIoNS 
The  following  recommendations  are  suggested  to improve the UG students’ use of EIRs in Nigeria  libraries: 
339 

========7========

DJLIT,  VOL.  34,  NO.  4, JULy  2014 
(a) The  UG  students  should  be  given  adequate  
library  orientation  and  trainings  on  the  use  of  
the  EIRs  during  their  first  two  months  in  the  
university.  To  equip  and  expose  them  to  the  
relevance  of  these  resources. 
(b) University  management  and  the  Curriculum  
Development  Board  of  National  University  
Commission  should  ensure  that  ‘Library  use  
instruction’  is  made  a  compulsory  course  with  
3 credit load for all UG students during the first  
and  the  second  semesters  of  their  first  year  in  
the  university. To  make  it  to  be  more  effective,  
the  librarians  should  be  made  to  lecture  this  
course.  This  is  necessary  because  acquisition  
of library use skill is a prerequisite requirement  
for  effective  use  of  the  library  resources.    (c) The  services  provision  of  the  librarians  should  
also  be  extended  to  assisting  UG  students  in  
retrieving their needed information. This will go  
a  long  way  in  enhancing  their  continued  and  
effective  utilisation  of  the  EIRs  in  the  library. (d) Additional trainings should also be organised by  
the library management anytime new software or  
databases  are  acquired. To  equip  the  students  
with the necessary skills needed for its effective  
utilisation.  
(e) Conscious efforts by means of routine trainings  
should be carried out by the librarians to encourage  
and  assist  the  students  in  developing  positive  
attitudes  towards  the  use  of  these  resources. 
12.  coNcLUSI oNS 
The benefits derivable from the use of libraries’  EIRs by UG students can never be over-emphasised.  This would not only assist them to achieve academic  excellence but would in this electronic era also, equip  them with the ability to face future challenges in the  society on graduation. The study has established that  EIRs are not adequately utilised by the UG students  in  the  institutions  in  the  South-West,  Nigeria  and,  that they also have negative attitude towards the use  of these resources. Attitude of UG students towards  the use of EIRs has significant relationship with their  actual use of the resources. Recommendations such  as  giving  the  students  adequate  library  orientation  and  trainings,  assisting  UG  students  in  retrieving  needed  information,  organising  routine  trainings,  effective teaching of use of library instruction, etc.,  have been made in the study. There is need for the  librarians,  library  management,  and  the  university  management  both  in  Nigeria  and  other  countries  having similar problems to join hands and adopt the  recommendations made in this study to ensure that  these variables duly investigated in the present study  and  found  to  have  significant  relationship  with  UG  students’  use  of  libraries’  EIRs  are  not  ignored. 
340 
Finally, it could be concluded that implementing  the  recommendations  made  in  this  study  would  enable the UG students to develop the right attitudes  needed  for  effective  use  of  libraries’  EIRs. This  by  extension will result in improved academic performance  of  the  UG  students.
