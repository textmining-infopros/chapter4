1.  INTRODUCTION 
The NTR College of Veterinary Science, Gannavaram,  Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh  is the constituent  college  of  Sri  Venkateswara  Veterinary  University   established  on  1st   January,  2008  with  the  aim  to  strengthen  education  and  research  in  the  field  of  Veterinary  Science  in  the  state.    
The  rapid  advancements  in  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  has  brought  a  revolutionary  change  in  the  information  scenario  giving rise to a number of options to handle varied  information sources conveniently, and effortlessly. As  a result, e-resources have become the most sought  after  modern  library’s  reserves  in  satisfying  varied  needs  of  students,  teachers,  and  researchers  with  minimum  effort  and  time.  Information  technology  has  changed  the  world  and  has  become  one  of  the  important  tools  for  retrieving  information.  The  e-information resources occupied a major portion of  library collections. The value and use of information  resources, particularly e-resources, have increased  with  the  time.  Therefore,  there  was  necessity  to  conduct study on the different aspects of e-resources  and  the  issues  relating  to  the  use  of  e-resources  
Received 12 December 2012, online published 17 September 2013 
by  students,  more  particularly  by  the  students  of  academic  and  research  universities.  The  present  study is aimed to analyse the use of e-resources by  the students of NTR College of Veterinary Science  (NTRCVS). The study is purposefully conducted for  the  improvement  of  library  services  in  Veterinary  Science  subject. 
2.  LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Various studies have been carried out regarding  to  the  exposure  of  computers  and  e-resources  to  the  students,  research  scholars  and  teachers  of  various institutions and universities. Swain & Panda1 in their study observed that faculty members prefer  using  e-articles,  e-thesis  and  dissertation  over  to  their  printed  counterparts.  
The Internet, e-mail, and e-resources are utilised  by  various  organisations  in  India.  The  usage  and  usability  of  e-journal  is  studied  by  Satpathy  &  Rout2,  reveils  that  faculty  members  are  aware  of  the  e-resources.      
The  online  access  to  full-text  journals  in  the  area of agriculture and veterinary sciences are being  provided to the students, researchers, and teachers  by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR)

4. METHODOLOGY 
This  study  is  based  on  survey  method  and  questionnaire  tool.  A  structured  questionnaire  was  designed  to  collect  data  from  the  students  of  NTR  College  Veterinary  Science,  keeping  in  mind  the  basic objectives of the study. The data was collected  from  the  visiting  students  during  the  educational  tour  of  National  Library  of  Veterinary  Sciences,  IVRI,  Izatnagar  during  2012. 
5.  DATA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 
44  (86.3  %)  questionnaires  out  of  51  students  visited the National Library of Veterinary Sciences,  Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) (Deemed  University)  were  received  back. The  data  collected  through the questionnaires was scrutinised, classified,  and  tabulated  for  better  understanding  and  clarity.   The  data  was  analysed  and  tabulated  by  using  suitable  statistical  methods. 
5.1 Student  Data 
Out  of  44  students,  33  (75  %)  were  male  and  11  (25  %)  are  female.  It  shows  that  more  male  members’  were  using  the  library  services  than  females.  
5.2 Computer  Knowledge  of  Veterinary  
Students 
In  present  computer  era,  functional  knowledge  of  computer  has  become  necessity  for  all  the 
students  for  their  study.  Keeping  this  fact  in  view,  the  present  study  makes  an  effort  to  ascertain  the  knowledge  of  computers  among  the  students  of  veterinary  science  colleges.      
The study shows that all the students were having  basic  functional  knowledge  of  computer,  which  is  a  good  sign  for  any  organisation.  The  study  found  that  the  students  are  having  ‘good  knowledge’  of  computers  as  shown  in  Table  1.  This  shows  that  NTR  College  of  Veterinary  Science,  is  providing  adequate  computer  training  to  the  students  to  use  all  the  existing  e-resources.

5.3 INTERNET   U SAGE 
Nowaday’s  internet  has  become  an  important  tool  for  education,  research,  and  teaching.  The  information  related  to  all  the  fields  is  available  on  internet,  which  is  very  useful  for  users  to  enrich  their knowledge. The present study makes an effort  to ascertain the use of internet, frequency, purpose,  and  place  of  internet  use. 
Table 2 indicates that frequency of internet use  by  the  students.  Majority  of  the  students,  i.e.,  20  (45.5  %)  use  internet  weekly,  40.9  %  of  students  use  internet  daily,  4.5  %    students  use  internet  on  fortnightly basis, a small percentage 2.3 % student  use  internet  once  in  month,  while  remaining  6.8  %  students  use  internet  as  and  when  required.

Table  7  shows  that  the  students  of  NTRCVS  used all the e-resources for their education. It shows  that 39.2 % respondents were using e-journal, 50 %  respondents using e-databases, 5.4 % respondents  equally using e-article and e-book. None of the students  were  using  e-thesis  and  other  e-resources.

5.5 Awareness  of  Copyright  and  IPR  Issues 
Copyright and Intellectual Property Right (IPR)  are  two  core  legal  issues  related  to  any  arbitrary  and indiscriminate use of both print and e-document.  The  users  should  have  the  knowledge  of  copyright  and  IPR  while  using  the  e-resources.  Realising  its  importance,  the  present  study  collected  data  and  analysed the same also. It is found that the majority  (75.61  %)  of  students  do  not  have  knowledge  regarding  the  ‘Copyright  and  IPR  issues’  which  is  quite  surprising. 
5.6  Criteria  for  Selection  and  Use  of  
E-resources  
Table  9  reveals  the  criteria  for  selection  and  use  of  e-resources.  The  majority  70  %  of  the  respondents know the ‘usability’ of e-resources and  20  %  of  the  respondents  feels  that  e-resources  are  ‘reliable’. further,  10  %  respondents  opt  for

5.7 Reasons  for  Dissatisfaction  on  Available  
E-resources 
The  reason  for  dissatisfaction  on  available  e-resources  at  NTRCVS  was  also  investigated  and  presented  in  Table  10.  The  study  shows  that  the  main  reason  of  dissatisfaction  on  the  available  e-resources.  The  majority  52.4  %  of  the  students  feels  that  the  e-resources  were  not  as  per  their  needs,  further  42.8  %  of  students  feels  that  the  infrastructure was not sufficient i.e., internet speed,  less  nodes  for  internet  etc.,  while    4.8  %  of    the  responses  noted  that  the  timing  of    library  ‘not  suitable’.

5.11  Users  Visit  to  the  Library    for  Services 
  The  frequency  of  students  visiting  library  of  its  services  was  also  measured.  We  can  see  here  that 26 (60.47 %) students visited library daily. This  is  a  good  sign  for  the  library  services. further  the  15  (34.88  %)  students  used  library  services  on  weekly  basis  and  2  (4.65  %)  students  visited  the  library  on  fortnightly  basis  (Table  14).

6. CONCLUSIONS 
It  is  clear  from  the  finding  that  the  students  of  NTR  College  of  Veterinary  Science  appreciate  the  services  provided  by  the  library  but  at  the  same time they expect more than that. Most of the  
397

DJLIT,  VOL.  33,  NO.  5, SEPTEMBER   2013 
students visited the library daily. Which is a positive  sign  but  some  of  the  student  visited  and  used  the  services  on  weekly  and  fortnightly  basis  because  of their busy schedule or other related works. Most  of the users feels that e-resources provided by the  library  to  the  great  extent  fulfill  their  requirements.  More  databases  in  veterinary  science  should  be  added  to  the  CeRA.  The  online  resources  are  the  need of the library to meet out the requirements of  target  groups.  There  is  a  need  to  train  the  staffs  of  library.  In  this  connection  the  authority  has  to  make  a  systematic  training  program  for  library  staff  from  time  to  time.  The  student  orientation  program’s are also to be incorporated in the regular  activity  of  the  library.  The  attitude  of  the  students  seems  very  positive  towards  e-resources  for  their  education  and  research.  Libraries  have  to  play  a  role  as  gateway  of  e-resources  and  to  provide  assistance in accessing these resources. The students  are  mainly  dependents  on  e-resources  for  their  required information and to keep up-to-date in their  subject area. More numbers of computers should be  
398 
increased  in  the  library  for  accessing  e-resources  and  using  other  e-services.The  study  reveals  that  the students of NTR College of Veterinary Science  are  using  the  available  e-resources  satisfactorily.  Still there is enough scope for the library to develop  its infrastructural facilities for providing the services  and  procurement  of  more  e-resources  particularly  in  the  field  of  Veterinary  Science.
