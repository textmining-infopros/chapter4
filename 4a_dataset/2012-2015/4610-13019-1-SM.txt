ABSTRACT 
This paper critically analyses 239 scholarly communications published in the inaugural fve volumes  
of Journal of Informetrics  ( JOI) to examine growth of literature, types of communications, authorship  pattern,  collaboration  trend,  predominant  research  domains,  etc.  Subsequent  analysis  focuses  on  prolifc contributors, degree of collaboration, and time-lag trend. Findings reveal that - publication output  
doubles over the study period as article publications increase considerably; though single-authored  contributions were signifcant (30 %), majority of contributions were collaborated by two-authors (36 %),  
while average authorship accounts for 2.28 per communications. Degree of collaboration (DC) was  impressive (0.699) but not overwhelming as research collaborations has emanated from 199 higher  
learning  institutions  of  32  countries  across  the  globe.  Ranking  of  prolifc  contributors  has  shown  
Prof. Egghe on the top followed by L Bornmann; R Rousseau and L Leydesdoff. Result also shows  upward trend of keyword usage with an average of 4.55 per items, of which h-index, citation analysis,  bibliometrics, g-index,  etc,  expectedly  predominates.  Scholarly  nature  of  source  journal  has  been  
further ascertained from increasing citations and reference usage trend. Moreover, growing hardness  
of the feld has been attributed to JOI  due to the increasing usage of tables and fgures. Study also  
showed that the journal takes an average of about four month time to publish a manuscript.   
Keywords:  Bibliometrics, bibliometric analysis, LIS journals, informetrics 
1.    INTRODUCTION  
Informetrics  is  an  active  and  specialised  sub- domain  of  information  science  formally  introduced  by  Prof.  Otto  Nacke,  in  1979,  but  the  concept  became  popularised  since  the  first  International  Informetrics Conference (1987). The rationale behind  the  introduction  of  a  new  discipline  mainly  arises  from  the  inability  of  the  existing  disciplines  like  bibliometrics  and  scientometrics  to  subsume  fairly  comprehensive  aspects  of  the  mathematical  view  on  problems  in  the  area  of  information  science1.  However,  generally  ‘informetrics’  encompasses  the  study  of  quantitative  aspects  of  information  in  any  form including records, bibliographies, social groups  and scientists. Tague-Sutcliffe2  broadened the scope  of  informetrics  by  adding  two  phenomena:  (a)  Definition  and  measurement  of  information;   
and 
(b) Types and characteristics of retrieval performance  
measures  to  the  earlier  concept.  
Thus,  it  could  accommodate  and  utilise  many  studies on information measurement that hitherto lied  outside the purview of bibliometrics and scientometrics.  Then,  Egghe3   more  comprehensively  suggested  “Informetrics  is  the  generic-term  encompassing

all-metrics  studies  related  to  information  science,  including bibliometrics (bibliographies, libraries, ...),  scientometrics  (science  policy,  citation  analysis,  research evaluation, ...), webometrics (metrics of the  web,  the  internet  or  other  social  networks  such  as  citation or collaboration networks), ...”.  So, informetrics  is  the  study  of  quantitative  aspects  of  information  which includes production, dissemination, retrieval,  and  measurement  of  information,  regardless  of  its  form or origin. However, Bar-Ilan4  in her review has  shown  evolution  of  ‘informetrics’  as  an  emerging  sub-domain of information science. Afterwards, Mayr  &  Umstätter5   quantitatively  justified  the  need  for  a  new  journal  in  the  field  of  informetrics. 
2.  GENESIS  OF  THE  SOURCE  JOURNAL  
Need for dedicated quality publication outlet for  informetric literature was first perceived by Prof. Leo  Egghe in 1989 and again during his guest editorship  of two special issues (on informetrics) of Elsevier’s  Information Processing & Management  journal. One  main  reason  was  the  steady  growth  in  the  field  of  informetrics  as  new  topics  have  been  emerging  every now and then, consequently innovative metric  tools, indicators, and indices are being proposed by  informetricians to gauge current research.  Existing

journals like Scientometrics,  JASIST  have somehow  cope with the situations either by increasing number  
impact  factor  (3.586).  The  JOI   being  the  flagship  journal  of  ‘informetrics’  literature  thus  a  potential  
of issues per year (both of these journals increased  candidate  for  an  in-depth  study  in  anticipation  to  
frequencies  from  2005  and  1998  respectively)  or  have  forced  to  expand  the  scope  of  the  existing  publication (in case of Information  Processing  and  Management). One feasible alternative might be to  publish special issues to showcase the contemporary  trends,  these  are  only  but  temporary  measure.  The  viable  solution  to  report  the  current  research  of  any  fast  growing  fields  (viz.,  informetrics)  is  to  broaden the reach by creating  dedicated specialist  
further  supplement  some  more  interesting  findings  to the existing literature.  Details of the journal are  available  at  www.elsevier.com/locate/joi.  
3.    LITERATURE  REVIEW  
Bibliometric studies of scholarly LIS journals are  well  documented  and  diversified,  it  was  found  that  half of the total literatures of information science are  on  bibliometric  studies  and  majority  of  those  were  
journals,  which  have  proven  enormous  successful  on  information  use  studies  generally  in  the  forms

The  JOI   is  a  scholarly  peer-reviewed  journal

philosophy,  JOI   provides  a  unique  channel  for  exchanging  innovative  ideas  and  developments  in  inter  and  multi-disciplinary  areas  like  bibliometrics,  scientometrics, webometrics, cybermetrics including  quantitative  linguistics.  Primary  goal  is  to  identify  analogues  problems  in  those  fields,  and  devise  general theorem, methodology, and procedure which  would  be  all  pervasive. 
In  the  very  second  year  of  inception,  the JOI became  the  winner  of  prestigious  Association  of  Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP)  award for the best new journal. Since then it has been  included in ISI (Thomson Reuter) and subsequently  received  first  impact  factor  during  2009.  Soon  the  journal  has  been  included  in  the  UN’s  information  delivery initiatives like HINARI (www.who.int/hinari),  AGORA  (www.aginternetwork),  and  OARE  (www. oaresciences.org)  to  facilitate  free  and  low  cost  access to the world’s journal literature in developing  countries  across  the  globe.

Mukerjee14   revisited  JASIST   to  show  growth  of  papers, authorship patterns, nature of collaboration,  geographical  dispersion,  nature  of  cited  and  citing  references, prolific authors and highly cited authors,  etc. Halder & Chandra15 highlighted growth, authorship  pattern,  subject  trends,  distribution  of  references,  illustrations and state wise distribution of contributors  of articles appeared of IASLIC Bulletin  during 2003  to  2007.  In  a  review,  Zainab16,  et  al. reported  11  bibliometric  studies  on  LIS  journals’.  Recently,  Thanuskodi17  studied  Library Philosophy and Practice for 2005–2009 to report that majority of articles were  single-authored  and  ‘computer  applications  in  the  LIS’ was the predominant area of research. Various  authorship  elements,  viz.,  most  productive  author,  their affiliation and geographical distributions, etc., of  D-Lib Magazine  was investigated by Park

5.    METHODOLOGY  
Keeping  in  view  of  the  aforesaid  objectives,  primary data for the study has been extracted from  the  Science  Direct   database  of  Elsevier  Science.  
Singh22,   et  al.  summarised  the  publication  trends,  authorship pattern and geographical dispersions of the  contributors of the DESIDOC Bulletin of Information  Technology.  In  the  same  year,  Kumar  &  Moorthy23 studied DJLIT  for 2001–2010 to explore growth and  authorship  pattern,  content  coverage  and  subject  distribution. Recently, Egghe24   has  reported  a  brief  profile  with  decent  overview  of  JOI   through  short  communication but a detail analysis of this esteem  journal is still due. Hence a sincere effort has been  pursued  to  study  the Journal  of  Informetrics (JOI)  quantitatively aiming in view to explore its scholarly  profile,  like  many  predecessors.

functionality  and  timely  updates.  Methodology  employed in the present study is basically bibliometric  scrutiny,  which  is  used  for  data  collection  and  analysis  of  relevant  bibliometric  attributes  of  the  communications  published  in  the  JOI.  Complete  searching  has  yielded  239  unique  records  that  are  considered reasonable sample for the purpose of this  study.  Relevant  bibliographic  elements  of  specific  communications, viz., year and type of publication,  contributor/s name, number, affiliations, collaboration  types,  keywords  supplied,  number  of  tables/charts  included,  number  of  references  appended,  number  of  citations  received  (by  particular  item),  date  of  receiving the and date of acceptance of the individual  manuscript,  etc.,  are  recorded  in  MS  Excel  spread  
appeared  in  the  inaugural  five  volumes  of Journal  of  Informetrics   during  2007  to  2011.  The  study  is  conducted  based  on  the  research  communications  like  articles,  editorial  notes,  short  communications  and letter to editors, etc. Noteworthy is the fact that  so-called less scholarly communications like - short  communications; editorial notes; letters to the editor;  etc.,  were  unlikely  taken  into  consideration  for  the  study  because  of  rich  intellectual  contents.  But,  communications like - conference announcements, list  of  reviewers,  etc.,  were  excluded  from  the  purview  of  this  study.  However,  present  study  is  conducted  towards  the  following  specific  objectives: • To  investigate  the  chronological  growth  of   
informetrics  literature;  
• To  study  authorship  pattern  of  the  published  
literatures;  
• To  enumerate    ranking  of  prolific  contributors  
and  their  affiliated  institutions;  
• To determine the extent of  research collaboration  
among  the  contributors  and  their  affiliated  
institutions  and  countries;  
• To  ascertain the scholarly nature of the  source  
journal from the study of  various bibliometric like  
– keyword, tables and charts usage; references  
appended,  citation  received,  etc; 
• To  deduce  the  time  lag  for  publishing  
Present  study  is  confined  to  the  publications  
sheet and subsequently analysed for making insightful  
observations  and  interpretations.  
Relevant  bibliometric  techniques  were  applied  to analyse the retrieved dataset objectively so as to  gauge the bibliometric pattern of the JOI. Rank lists  of prolific contributors and their affiliated institutions  have been prepared based on the fractional counting  method25  and normal counting method respectively.  Research collaboration among the scholars has been  estimated  in  terms  degree  of  collaboration  (DC)  using Subramanyan’s formula26. Different bibliometric  elements of JOI, viz citation and reference frequency,  keyword distributions and table and graph distribution  of the journal have been tabulated. Thus a thorough  analysis  of  collected  data  has  been  worked  out  in  different  dimensions  using  various  mathematical  and  statistical  techniques.  
6.    ANALYSIS  AND  FINDINGS  
Analysis  of  collected  data  has  revealed  many  interesting  findings  which  signify  many  scholarly  attributes  of  the  source  journal. 
6.1 Year-wise  Distribution  of  Contributions 
Table 1 shows chronological distribution of types  of  items  published  in  the  journal  during  the  study  period.  Total  239  communications  was  appeared  during  2007  to  2011,  of  which  212  (88.70  %)  were  scholarly  articles  and  rest  of  27  communications  belonged to short communications (5.02 %), letter to  
and  identify  the  average  time  lags    for  
editors (5.02 %), and  editorials in negligible  portion  
(1.24 %). So, research articles were found to be the

publications  over  the  same  period.  
6.2 Authorship  Pattern 
Authorship is the important bibliometric measures  reflecting  contemporary  communication  patterns,  productivity and collaboration among the researchers.  Thus,  knowledge  of  authorship  could  be  helpful  in  assessing research patterns at individual, organisational,  and also in disciplinary levels. For authorship study,  name  and  corresponding  affiliations  of  individual  contributor  were  collected  from Science  Direct   as  primary dataset. In case of contributors having more  than  one  affiliation  in  the  same  articles,  only  the  first  affiliation  was  considered.  Various  facets  of  authorship, viz., authorship patterns, i.e., categorisation  of authors according to authorship values, average  authorship  per  contribution,  collaborative  research  carried  out  by  the  community,  determination  of  the  degree of collaboration (DC) among the contributors,  identification  of  prolific  contributors  in  the  subject  specialty  are  deduced  using  this  dataset. 
Table 2 represents the authorship pattern identified  in the JOI  communications during 2007-2011. Analysis  shows  a  total  of  545  occurrences  of  authors  in  different  authorship  positions  during  the  period,  thus  average  authorship  was  found  2.28  for  each  publication. It was also observed that   though single- authored contributions were quite significant (30 %),  two-authored contributions (36 %) were found to be  most predominant,  followed by three authors (19 %),  four  authors  (3  %)  and  rest  of  the  communications  
6.3 Ranking  of  Prolific Authors 
Table 3 enumerates the ranking of contributing  authors  based  on  their  weighted  value  of  total  contributions in JOI during the study period. Weighted  value  of  contributors  have  been  calculated  using  fractional  counting  method;  where  total  weight  (one)  of  an  article  is  distributed  equally  among  all  the  (co-authors  for  multi-authored)  contributions  irrespective  of  their  position.  This  could  produce  more distinctive listing of authors and subsequently  removes  anonymous  ranking28.  
Results show a total of 326 unique authors have  545 occurrences in different authorship positions of  239  contributions  of  JOI  during  the  study  period.  It  is  also  observed  that  top  10  positions  (ranks)  were  occupied  by  ten  eminent  bibliometricians.  Editor-in-chief,    Leo  Egghe  (Universiteit  Hasselt,  Belgium)  was  found  to  be  the  most  prolific  author  followed by Lutz Bornmann (ETH Zurich, Switzerland);  Ronald  Rousseau  (KHBO,  K  U  Leuven,  Belguim);  Loet  Leydesdorff  (University  of  Amsterdam,  The  Netherland);  Hans-Dieter  Daniel  (ETH  Zurich,  Switzerland);  Marek  Kosmulski  (Lublin  University  of  Technology,  Poland);  Wolfgang  Glänzel  (K.U.  Leuven,  Belgium),  etc.  It  is  also  found  from  the  list  that  majority  of  the  productive  contributors  are  senior academician of informetrics and allied fields  and associated with active institutions of informetric  research.  Many  of  them  have  served  as  editorial  members of the JOI. Similar incidents also reported  
were    in  collaborations  ranging  from  five    to  even

studies. This observation is  clearly  in  concurrence  with  the  declared  objective  of  the  journal.  
6.4  Research  Collaboration 
Collaboration  is  an  intense  form  of  interaction  fostering effective communication as well as sharing  of  competence  and  other  resources  in  search  of  new  knowledge.  Research  collaboration  is  very  much  common  and  highly  practiced  especially  in  multidisciplinary  domains.  Literature  shows  that  research  collaboration  is  discipline  dependent  and  generally  higher  in  the  experimental  fields  of  science  and  technology  but  lower  in  the  fields  of  humanities.  Here,  degree  of  collaboration  (DC)  -  a  proxy measure for research collaboration among the  contributors  was  derived  by  using  Subramanyam26

communications,  about  70  %  were  collaborated  by  multiple-authors ranging from two to nine co-authors  and rests were non-collaborative. Table also shows  the degree of collaboration of JOI  varied inconsistently  from 0.588 to 0.806 during the study period. Average  degree of collaboration was impressive (0.699) but  not overwhelming. Gradual increase (8 % to 23 %)  of multi-authored communications over the years of  JOI  clearly  indicates  prevalence  of  team  or  group  research amongst the informetrics community. Similar  observation  has  also  found  in  different  fields  of  basic  and  applied  sciences.

Results  also  showed  that  majority  of  contributors  were  affiliated  to  the  universities  and  research  institutes of developed countries. Active participation  of institutions across geographical boundaries implies  the  recognition  and  reputation  this  journal  among  world  informetrics  community.  Noteworthy  is  the  fact that, majority of the affiliated institutions found  in  the  study  was  also  in  the  list  of  similar  study  made  on  the  journal Scientometrics

6.7    Composition  of  Editorial  Board 
Since inception,  JOI  has been endowed with an  eminent panel of informetricians of international repute  to monitor editorial works. Inaugural editorial board  consists of as many as 33 eminent scholastics of 17  different countries across the globe, which included  USA (11), Belgium (3), The Netrherlands (3), UK (2),  Sweden  (2).  Many  of  them  (including  Prof.  Egghe)  have  contributed  good  number  of  papers  having  mathematical  treatment  on  the  policy  implications  for research evaluations in the fields of information  
with  239  communications  of  JOI.  Third  column  of  Table  7  shows  an  upward  trend  of  keyword  usage  with  the  average  of  4.55  keywords  per  item  over  the  years.  Table  8  is  the  truncated  enumeration  of  keywords  with  their  frequency  of  occurrences  in  the  records  analysed.  It  reflects  total  of  690  unique  keywords.  Most  frequently  used  keyword  found  in  the  study  is  ‘h-index’  (40  times)  followed  by  ‘citation  analysis  ‘(23  times),  ‘Bibliometrics’  (22  times) and ‘g-index’  (18  times)  whereas  some  562  keywords were used once. Review of the enumerated  keyword revealed that topics related to informetrics  allied sub-domains were predominately appeared in  this  scholarly  communications  which  seems  to  be  in  agreement  with  Prof.  Egghe’s  intention  that  the  journal (JOI) would grow in the line with the mutual  growth  of  informetrics  and  related  areas.

communications  of  the JOI   have  appended  a  total  of 1757 tables and figures with an average of 7.35  per  item.  Results  also  showed  increasing  trend  of  appending  tables  and  figures,  indicating  increase  of  ‘hardness’  of  the  research  communications  as  suggested by Smith29, et al.,  ‘harder’  the  discipline  uses  greater  number  of  graphs  and  figures.  So,  the  result  here  seems  to  comply  with  the  basic  objectives  of  the  JOI   that  the  journal  ( JOI)  aims  to  contribute  to  increase  the  ‘degree  of  hardness’  of  the  field  of  informetrics.  
6.8.3  Variations  of  Reference  Appended  
Table  7  (Fifth column)  shows  the  year-wise  variations  of  total  references  appended  with  the  individual  communications  of  the  JOI.  It  reflects  that  8024  references  were  included  with  239  JOI communications during the study period. Therefore,  on an average about 34 references were appended  in each item which varied from 23 to 45 during the  
its  actual  publication  in  the  journal.  Here,  time  lag  of  all  individual  articles  of JOI  have  been  counted  separately  in  days  and  grouped  them  into  various  time-slots.  Subsequently,  the  number  of  articles  (frequency)  belong  to  each  group  is  tabulated  and  statistical  mean  value  of  time  lag  has  been  calculated, as shown in the Table 9. Result shows an  average of about three month has been consumed  by  the  journal  to  publish  the  accepted  manuscript.  Table also shows that, time lag of majority (181) of  articles  was  varying  from  3  to  6  months  and  there  is  hardly  any  consistency  what  so  ever.  However,  implementation of web-based manuscript submission  system  through  Elsevier  Editorial  System  (ESS)  would  be  a  great  help  to  ensure  timely  publication  of  the  accepted  manuscripts.

Analysis  presented  in  this  study  has  permitted  
the  JOI  based  on  Scopus.  Results  shows  that  239  
some inferences of broad generality on the bibliometric  
published communications of the JOI had received a  total of 1458 citations from various literatures up to  
of  the JOI    received  an  average  of  6.10  citations  
profiles of the JOI  which illuminates scholarly nature  
as  suggested  by  Moed  &  Leeuwen30.  Naturally,  relatively older communications have received higher  citations as total citations decreased gradually over  the  years.  Highest  citation  received  by  an  article  (68) was identified by the Schubert & Glänzel (2007)  article  whereas  as  many  as  98  articles  have  not  received  a  single  citation.  Majority  of  these  (89)  are  in  their  early  stage  of  citations  and  published  during  2010(35)  to  2011(54).

Moreover, diversity  of  authorship  across  the  disciplines  and  countries  gives international flavor to the source journal.  As  desired by Prof. Egghe, many of the editorial board  members  have  contributed  good  number  of  papers  to  the  journal.

Contributors  from  higher  learning  Institutions  of  European Union country clearly predominates in the  informetric  research.  Diversity  of  contributors  and  prevalence of collaborative contributions from Europe,  America (N) and Asian regions indicates - intellectual  perception from various origin have been intermingled  into  this  scholarly  communications.  Furthermore,  being  the  flagship  journal,  JOI   has  maintained  careful  balance  among  the  frontier  research  areas  and often publishes landmark studies on informetrics  and allied sub-domains. Little surprisingly, topics like  h-index,  citations  analysis,  bibliometrics,  g-index,  impact  factor,  and  peer  review  have  dominated  in  the  research  communications.
