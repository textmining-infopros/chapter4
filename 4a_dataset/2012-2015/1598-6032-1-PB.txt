ABSTRACT
The paper identifies blogs in the area of marketing of library and information services and assesses their
features and contents during January to June 2009. It is found that six blogs on marketing of library services
are active and cover variety of features, frequency, file formats, web resource categories and subjects
including marketing.
Keywords: Blogs, marketing, library and information services

1. INTRODUCTION
In the present era, there are many internet-based
communication tools and blog is one of them. A blog or
weblog consists of a webpage that is set out as a diary so
that almost every day or any day, one and more authors
(bloggers) can send their articles that is known as posts
(entries), to be published online. The weblog can take the
form of a diary, news services, a collection of links to other
resources, book reviews, reports of activity on a project,
photographic images of the events, and audio and videos
in many form/format of documents such as MS word,
powerpoint, excel or portable document file (pdf). Blog
entries incorporate title, date, and time of publication,
assigned category headings, keywords, hyperlinks to
other web resources and name of contributor of the post.
Each of a blog’s entry often appear in two or three
columns or with one or more columns featuring lists of
links to other sites of related or common interest.
Reichardt and Harder1 defined weblog, or blog as ‘a
website resembling a personal journal that is updated with
individual entries or postings’. Stone2 described weblog as
‘a personal website that provides updated headlines and
news articles of other sites that are of interest to the user,
also may include journal entries, commentaries, and
recommendations compiled by the users’.
Wikipedia defines a blog (a contraction of the term
weblog) as ‘a type of website usually maintained by an
individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions
of events, or other material such as graphics or video.

Blog entries are commonly displayed in reverse
chronological order”3.
It is clear from the above definitions that blog is a most
frequently updated website containing variety of
information which are arranged in reverse chronological
order, equipped with some technological platforms of web
2.0 and build for common or specific purpose.
The number of blogs is growing. In May 2007, a
quarterly survey made by blog search engine Technorati
tracked more than 70 million blogs. It was found that every
day 120,000 new blogs are created and 1.5 million posts
are made4. Wikipedia claimed that as of 16 February
2011, there are over 156 million public blogs available on
the web5.
The two-way communication feature of a blog offers
great possibilities for free flow of information on both ends
(blogger and reader) and helps in many ways such as
solving queries, expressing feelings and obtaining
feedback through comments. Another feature of most
blogging software is the facility to automatically archive
entries. Availability of RSS (Really Simple Syndication)
feeds also help to track new blog posts automatically for
those users who have subscribed them.
A logically arranged and well written blog is not only
fascinating but also can be an effective tool for getting
information on particular area. Weblogs on general topics
provide information to all the users whereas subject
specific weblogs are meant to serve special groups or

communities. A review of some of the LIS blogs and library
literature shows how the LIS community has been
effectively using blogs for a variety of purposes.

2. REVIEW OF LITERATURE
Many authors have detailed information regarding
history of blogs and the tools needed for creating and
maintaining them. Blood’s handbook imparted information
regarding creating and maintaining blogs as well as their
history and resources required6. The first library related
blog was developed by Levine through her librarian’s site
Du Jour7 in 1995. Thereafter, numerous library-related
blogs have been created. Many authors have studied
blogs, its contents and features. Clyde analysed 55 blogs
in the library and information science field through its
origin by countries, types of libraries involved, blog
software used, blogs’ aims and purposes, selected
content features, and updation frequency of library blogs8.
Some studies such as that of Herring9, et al.,
analysed 203 randomly-selected weblogs by various
genre and coding like characteristics of blog author, blog
purpose, and structure of blog and frequency of blog
update9. Aharony conducted an analysis of LIS blog’s
comments received from readers in two phases, one is
statistical descriptive analysis and another is content
analysis10.
Carver stated that libraries should use blogs, as
“adding a blog to your library’s website, can add currency
and freshness. It can also encourage patron community
where everyone shares knowledge”11. Fichter urged
libraries to use blogs in as marketing tool to promote and
explore library services to their ultimate users12. Trivedi
stated that libraries and librarians are developing LIS
blogs on various topics which may be used for enrichment
and promotion of library services13. John Dupois runs
Confessions of a Science Librarian blog14 that shows a
special interest on academic science librarians. The
Krafty Librarian15 regularly posted information on medical
librarianship issues. Vegel & Goans added that Georgia
State University explored science news/events under its
blogging programme initiatives16.
Reichardt and Harder suggested that academic
libraries should develop subject-specific blogs with
contents to meet and fulfill the information needs of the
users17. Kim carried out a content analysis of cancerrelated blog posts on the basis of comparison of userdefined subject tagging and software-generated subject
tagging18. Pattnaik & Pattnaik listed a few subject-specific
blogs focusing on the topics of library technology, library
marketing, library legal issues, library association and
internal library communication in library and information
science area19.
Cooke defined usefulness of medical news feeds in a
health science environment20. Laing, Lavallee-Welch, &
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(2)

Smith suggested criteria for determining the value of
blogs21. ‘Blogger Tool kit evaluating LIS blogs’ provided
criteria such as authority, purpose, currency, objectivity,
and depth of the material which are similar to that used for
evaluating websites to also evaluate the blogs in library
and information science field22. Crawford studied number
of posts, number of comments and post length of 607 LIS
blogs during three months period (March to May) in two
consecutive years 2007 and 2008 respectively23. In 2008,
Blair and Level outlined the creation of a subject-based
blog at Colorado State University Libraries (CSUL) named
as “The Biology, Agriculture & Natural Resources
(BANR)” and suggested unique evaluation techniques for
library blog such as online survey, web tracking software,
RSS feed tracking, and the use of blog search engine
methods24.
Although there is adequate literature on blogs, its
creation and usefulness, there is no sufficient literature on
blog assessment especially blog posting and evaluation
of subject specific blogs, particularly in the library and
information science discipline.

3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the study are to:
•

Identify blogs on marketing of library services;

•

Examine the features present in the selected blogs in
terms of its contents, and structure-based on the
home page; and

•

Analyse the blog posts on the basis of each blog
frequency, currency, and posting features during the
predetermined time period of six months (January to
June 2009).

4. METHODOLOGY
Searches were conducted through google
(www.google.com), yahoo (www.yahoo.com) and
AskJeeves (www.askjeeves.com) using the search terms
library marketing blog, library marketing, blog + marketing
library service and blog on marketing library area. Blog
search engines and directories such as Technorati (http:/
/technorati.com/), Blogdigger (http://www. blogdigger.
com/index.html), Blogpulse (http://www.blogpulse.com/),
Peter Scott’s directory of LIS weblogs (http://
www.libdex.com/weblogs.html), yahoo blog directory
(http://dir.yahoo.com/news_and_media/blogs/),
and
google blog directory (http://www.google.com/intl/en/
press/blog-directory.html) were also consulted to check
the blogs specially developed on the marketing library
services.
Blog roll is an important feature in the blogging
environment by which a blogger lists other interested or
related blogs connected with the basic theme of a blog.
187

Therefore, blog roll section of each identified blog was
also checked in order to identify related blogs.
From the above exercise, 11 blogs were identified on
marketing of library and information services as shown in
Table 1.
However, after a thorough examination of the 11 blogs
in Table 1, it was found that 5 blogs do not have posts after
October 2008 and hence, these were not included for the
study considering that these were not active blogs.
Table 2 gives details of these inactive blogs.
As such six active blogs were selected for the study
out of 11 blogs on marketing of library services subject
and their analysis were carried out on the basis of
features and content of 212 entries posted during
selected period of six months (January to June 2009).

can be seen that there is a considerable variations in the
features among the blogs. Only two features, comments
posting facility and archive are found to be available on all
the six blogs. None of the blogs have purpose statement,
links to related resources, disclaimer and calendar,
features that are commonly seen in blogs.
Some special features found in specific blogs include
flag counter that used for keep track about how many
people accessed the particular blogs from different
countries of world on the basis on their country related
flags, Shelfari is a web-based tool used for displaying
books virtually similar like books keep in book shelves
(information about books related to marketing library
area), call facility and find the blogger online through
various platforms such as delicious.com, university
website, etc., on the blog MMFL.

Table 3 gives the URLs, owners and the blog tool used
with regard to the six identified blogs. Except for the blog,
Bubble Room, which has been created by Library Journal
using custom made software, the other blogs have used
either the popular blog tool Blogger (http://
www.blogger.com/starts)
or
Wordpress
(http://
wordpress.com/).

The MWML had an option to get reactions such as
such as funny, interesting, cool, etc., on its blog postings
and also provides facility to deliver blog entries on a user’s
mobile on the user mobile number. The LMT provides
video bar facility powered by YouTube, ILMA highlights
heading of recent posts and recent comments, NJLMN
highlights recent comments, top posts (information
regarding other pages of blog) and blog metadata, and BR
has special features like recent posts, recent comments
and statistics about most comments received against
topics.

entries in ‘NJLMN’ and 37 entries in ‘BR’ blog. Only nine
postings were made by ‘LMT’ during period of study.
‘Comment’ section is a key feature in the blogging
environment which shows the responses to blog postings.
Among selected blogs on subject, ‘BR’ blog posts
received the highest number of 89 comments, ‘NJLMN’
received 20 comments and ‘MWML’ got 18 comments
whilst MMFL had not received a single comment during
the period of study. A particular blog post, ‘Library
Branding 101’ on the ‘BR’ blog received the highest
number of 36 comments25.
Table 5 also indicates that the frequency of blogging is
fairly low.

5.4 Features in Blog Posts
Apart from the blogger’s own views, blog posts many
times also include hyperlinks, images, and videos. The

study found that the maximum number of hyperlinks (118)
was found in ‘MWML’ followed by 68 hyperlinks in ‘MMFL’
and 46 hyperlinks in ‘BR’ (Table 6). Image serves as a
mirror of the any material, assists in understanding the
material and attracts users as well which are frequently
used in blog entries. With regard to the images also,
‘MWML’ blog had the maximum 68 images and ‘BR’
incorporated 18 images whereas ‘LMT’ and ‘Marketing
your Library’ had only two images each.
The hyperlink target formats were also looked at and it
was found that hypertext markup language (HTML) pages
were the most commonly linked format by the blogs.
Microsoft Word (DOC), PDF and PPT were used sparingly
by the blogs.

5.5 Hyperlinked Content
The contents of the hyperlinked in the blog posts were
analysed and is summarised in Table 7. The highest
number of hyperlinks was to websites of individuals,
institutions, libraries, and commercial organisations. The
second highest category was ‘Audio/Video/Image’ and
third was ‘Blog posting/ particular entries’. In addition to
these links were also made to ‘articles’, ‘news’,
‘conference/workshop announcements and ‘books/
journals/magazines’. The “MMFL” blog26 was the only blog
to link to seven bibliographies on marketing library and
information.

5.6 Subject Coverage
The topic of marketing of libraries and information
services has several sub-topics. Table 8 gives the
various sub-topics dwelt by the different blogs during the
selected period of the study. It can be seen that a wide
range of sub-topics have been covered by the selected
blogs. Some blogs have covered aspects other than
marketing of libraries and information services which
reflects that marketing techniques and its theories are

Though, only six blogs have been found to be
active in the present time but no entry is made by
MMFL, ILMA, and NJLMN after May 30, 2011, April 4,
2011 and March 17, 2011, respectively. Among six
selected blogs for the study, maximum 26 entries
(posting) made by ‘MWML blog’ and minimum 1 entry
found on the blog namely ‘ILMA’, if examines the
present status of blog posting feature by setting a
small sub set of predetermined time period of three
months (April to June 2011) that is shown through
Table 9. In the selected period of time, comments,
hyperlinks, and images also looked which found
maximum on the blog, namely, ‘MMFL’. The study was
further discovered that the hyperlinks available in the
blog’s posts within selected time period and found
that maximum hyperlinks attached with HTML format
in comparison of other three discovered formats of web
resources.

6. DISCUSSIONS
It can be seen from this study that only six blogs are
active in the area of marketing of library and information
services. Majority of blogs developed through Blogger

were developed by individual owners. It is suggested that
more blogs on the subject should be created in order to
impart concise and worthy information to wide spectrum
of LIS community. It is suggested that associations and
library and information agencies should build blogs with
variety of web-based software and tools. It is found that
maximum blogs contain archive; content posting facility,
author name, and RSS feed features while none of the
blogs have given purpose statement and disclaimer
features. The blogs should incorporate purpose statement,
disclaimer, copyright statement, complete profile of the
bloggers and use of web 2.0 tools especially RSS feed,
podcast, and social networking tools which will be
certainly be helpful to make blogs more attractive and
informative. Considering that posting and commenting are
low, it is suggested that entries on the identified blogs should
be more frequent and the blogs should encourage potential
users to participate in discussion on the blog postings.

7. CONCLUSIONS
Blogs have become a worthy source of information in
a given field of interest. It is seen from the study that
blogging in the area of marketing of libraries and
information services is not prolific with few blogs on the
subject seemingly having stopped altogether. The other
blogs also have a low frequency of postings. Blogs in the
area of marketing of library services cover a variety of
aspects. However, there is a need to develop more blogs
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(2)

on the subject which provide concrete information, depth
coverage of subject, lively postings, update frequently (on
daily basis) and right on targets (aim and theme of blog)
as a good blog that can be more helpful in fulfilling the
information needs promptly and saving the time of the
users as well as librarians.
