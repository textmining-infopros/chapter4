The  paper  describes  a  study  of  12  university  libraries  of  Haryana,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Jammu  &  Kashmir,  Punjab  and  UT  Chandigarh  with  special  reference  to  ICT  applications. The  response  to  the  questionnaire and information available on university websites, show that 8 of the 12 libraries have distinct  names. Chaudhry Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University has 99 branch libraries of different levels;  Panjab University, Chandigarh more than 60; and University of Kashmir (UK) has 60 branch libraries. All  the libraries have web presence, either through university website (8 no.) or direct (4). All the libraries  have their own buildings of 3 to 8 foors with a seating capacity ranging from 200 to 1300. Universities  have either campus wide Wi-Fi connectivity (6 libraries) or have partially completed the project (5 libraries).  There are 100 computers each for users with internet connectivity in Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra  and UK. Library membership varies between 887 in Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Science &  Technology (AS&T) and 15,738 in Punjabi University, Patiala (PbiU). Total 92 persons are working in PbiU  library and still has 63 % vacant positions at Assistant Librarian and above while smallest staff strength  is in AS&T (10 persons). Largest collection of 6.5 lac books is in UK library which also has small number  of audio and braille books. All the libraries are providing readers’ guidance within library; OPAC search;  reading room for personal books; online search by library staff and users themselves; photocopy service;  book reservation and renewal services. The paper concludes that university libraries have acquired ICT  infrastructure and digital resources, and are offering ICT-based services despite a general administrative  apathy towards alarming condition of vacant positions.

1.  INTrodUCTIoN 
The  post-independence  period  has  seen  a  remarkable  expansion  in  Indian  higher  education  system. “The number of Universities has increased  34  times  from  20  in  1950  to  677  in  2014.  The  sector  boasts  of  45  Central  Universities  of  which  40  are  under  the  purview  of  Ministry  of  Human  Resource  Development,  318  State  Universities,  185  State  Private  universities,  129  Deemed  to  be  Universities,  51  Institutions  of  National  Importance  (established under Acts of Parliament) under MHRD  (IITs-16, NITs–30 and IISERs–5) and four Institutions  (established under various State legislations)”1.This  expansion  has  taken  place  following  the  norms  of  a  number  of  regulatory  bodies  in  their  respective  fields, such as University Grants Commission (UGC),  All  India  Council  for  Technical  Education  (AICTE),  National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE),The  Bar Council of India (BCI), Medical Council of India  (MCI), and so on. Although, it is debatable whether  the  norms  were  as  strictly  observed  while  granting  permission  to  open  new  institutions  as  is  done  in

accreditation  of  courses  in  USA  particularly  in  the  light of the comments from some industry stalwarts  that  majority  of  the  products  of  Indian  educational  institutions  are  not  employable. 
One  may  take  a  position  on  either  side  of  the  argument,  but  despite  all  odds,  Indian  higher  education  system  has  done  remarkable  job.  The  products  of  our  colleges  and  universities  have  put  India  in  the  forefront  of  knowledge  economy.  
2.  LITerATUre revIew 
Indian university libraries have been the subject  of  a  large  number  of  investigations  by  Indian  LIS  professionals. More than three decades ago, Goyal   & Anand2   found  that  out  of  32  university  libraries,  all  were  providing  ILL  service;  21  reprographic;  10  documentation list/bibliographies; 7 each newspaper  clipping  and  indexing  and  abstracting  service;  and  6 libraries were providing translation services. More  than  a  decade  later  in  1997,  Prodhani  &  Gautam3 studied  the  status  of  university  libraries  in  North  East  India. They  found  that  NEHU  had  the  highest

DJLIT,  VOL.  35,  NO.  4,  JULY  2015 
number  of  86  staff  members  followed  by  Assam  Agriculture University with 82 and Gauhati University  with 71. Gauhati University had the largest collection  of more than 1.87 lac books, followed by Dibrugarh  University  with  1.4  Lac  and  NEHU  with  1.35  Lac.   Venkata Ramana & Rao4   in  2003  found  that  out  of  14  central  university  libraries,  all  had  telephone;  12  had  Xerox  and  e-mail  facility;  7  had  internet  and  fax;  and  2  libraries  had  their  website  also.  About  86  %  libraries  used  CDS/ISIS  while  57  %  used LibSys software for library automation. Among  central  universities,  NEHU  was  the  first  to  start  computerisation in 1986. Among computerised library  services,  50  %  libraries  were  providing  accessions  list,  followed  by  internet  search  (43  %);  reference  and  CD/ROM  (35  %);  CAS,  ILL  and  online  search  (28  %  each).  Vasishta5   investigated  six  deemed  universities  of  engineering  in  North  India.  She  found  that  NIT,  Kurukshetra  had  highest  number  of  1,59,752  books;  Thapar  Institute  of  Engineering  and Technology (TIET) had highest 3,843 e-journals;  and NIT, Hamirpur had maximum 1,814 audio-visual  documents.  NIT,  Srinagar  had  highest  number  of  21  staff  members,  followed  by  Punjab  Engineering  College  with  15  members. All  the  NITs  were  using  LibSys  software  while  TIET  was  using  SOUL. 
Vijayakumar6   found  that  out  of  five  university  libraries of Kerala only two had university librarian.  Kerala  University  library  had  maximum  48  persons  in  the  library  followed  by  Calicut  University  library  with  27  persons.  Quite  a  large  number  of  library  positions  were  lying  vacant.  Cochin  University  library  had  35.71  %  vacant  positions,  while  Kerala  University  library  had  30.47  %  vacancies.  Valmiki  &  Ramakrishnegowda7   studied  ICT  infrastructure  in  six  university  libraries  of  Karnataka. They  found  that  Gulbarga  University  library  had  maximum  140  desktops and 5 servers. Two universities were using  LibSys while all the libraries had campus wide LAN.  5  libraries  had  internet  connection  through  Ernet  and  BSNL  with  maximum  bandwidth  of  2  mbps. 
Adithya Kumari & Talwar8  studied the reference  collection  in  university  libraries  in  Karnataka. They  found that Mangalore University library had maximum  2890 reference titles, followed by Mysore University  library  with  2694  titles  and  Karnataka  University  library  with  1860  titles.  When  data  was  analysed  for  number  of  users  per  title,  it  was  revealed  that  Mangalore University library again had the best ratio  of 0.44 users per title. Bhatt9  described the document  delivery service using JCCC at Banasthali University.  During  August  2008  to  July  2011  the  Document  Delivery  Centre  of  the  University  received  1704  requests  and  fulfilled  74.94  %  requests.  However,  there  was  an  increasing  trend  in  fulfillment  of  requests from 66.74 % in the first year to 83.98 %  during  the  third  year.In  a  recent  study  of  three  
259 
selected university libraries of Haryana, Mehar Singh  &  Arora10   found  that  Bhagat  Phool  Singh  Mahila  Vishwavidyalaya (BPSMV) had the largest collection  of  69139  books,  while  Deenbandhu  Chhotu  Ram  University of Science & Technology (DCRUST) had  3475 standards. DCRUST library had largest covered  area of 4552 sq. mtr.; O.P. Jindal Global University  (OPJGU) library had 14 persons in their staff and 47  computers. OPJGU library was member of INDEST,  CSIR Consortium and DELNET while DCRUST was  member  of  UGC-INFONET  and  INDEST. 
Thus,  the  university  libraries  in  India  have  wide  variations  in  all  respects,  be  it  infrastructure,  collection,  staff  or  services.  The  same  variation  is  expected  in  this  region  of  the  country. 
3.  objeCTIveS 
The  study  intends  to  present  an  overview  of  the  state  of  university  libraries  in  the  North  Indian  states  of  Haryana,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Punjab  and  UT Chandigarh. Aspects like IT infrastructure, staff,  membership,  budget,  collection,  and  IT  services  have  been  included  in  the  study. 
4.  MeThodo Logy 
It was planned to include only those universities  that came into existence before 21st century and have  played  a  leading  role  in  education  and  research  in  the region. So, the study was conducted through a

questionnaire sent by e-mail to 16 libraries. Finally,  12  libraries  responded.  The  responding  university  libraries  are  shown  in  Table  1.  The  response  of  some  of  the  libraries  was  not  very  clear,  so  it  was  cross checked wherever possible from the university/ library  website.  
5. ANALySIS 
5.1  Status  of  University  Libraries 
Table  2  shows  that  the  oldest  university  in  the  region,  Panjab  University  was  established  in  1882  while  the  newest  university  Sher-e-Kashmir  University of Agricultural Science & Technology Was  established in 1999. Almost 8 of the 12 responding  libraries  had  a  distinct  name.  These  libraries  and  their names are shown in Table 1. All the university  libraries  have  their  own  buildings.However,  except  HAU, KUK and AS&T the libraries were sharing the  building with or accommodating other departments/ branches.   All  the  university  library  buildings  have  three  to  eight  floors  and  seating  capacity  of  200  to  1300.  Interestingly,  floor  area  varies  to  a  great  extent.  It  is  5187  sq.m.  in  GJU  while  13,935  sq.m.  in  GNDU.  In  certain  cases  information  regarding  
area  is  not  readily  available  with  the  library. 
5.2  IT  Services 
The  impact  of  internet  is  clearly  visible  in  the  university libraries. The university libraries generally  have  links  through  their  university  websites.  Table  3  shows  that  only  four  university  libraries  -  PUC,  HAU, UK and GNDU, have direct web access. None  of the responding libraries has a blog while except  University of Jammu all the libraries can be accessed  via e-mail. Only Punjab University, Chandigarh has  facebook  presence.  The  university  libraries  in  the  region have quite variations with respect to branches  as  Haryana Agricultural  University  has  99  different  type  of  branch  libraries  while  Guru  Jambheshwer  University  of  Science  and  Technology  does  not  have  any  branch.  
All  the  state  university  libraries  are  members  of  INFLIBNET  and  UGC-Infonet  Digital  Library  Consortium.  In  addition  to  this,  PUC,  UK,  UJ  and  PbiU libraries are members of DELNET, while PbiU  is  also  a  member  of  INDEST.  All  the  agricultural  university  libraries  are  member  of  Consortium  for  e-Resources in Agriculture (CeRA). AgriCat, a subset  of  WorldCat,  is  a  union  catalogue  of  agricultural

libraries developed in collaboration with OCLC under  eGranth. So, not only these 2 but all the agricultural  university  libraries  are  participating  in  it.  
5.3  ICT  Infrastructure 
The ICT infrastructure is gradually increasing in  all  the  university  libraries.  Table  4  shows  that  six  of the universities have entire campus Wi-Fi, while  5  universities  have  completed  the  work  partially.  Nine libraries have computers connected over LAN.  KU  has  the  highest  number  of  40  computers  with  Internet  accessibility  for  staff  while  both  UK  and  KUK have 100 internet accessible computers each,  for users. Eight university libraries have computers  for  staff  without  internet  access  and  two  university  libraries  have  computers  mainly  for  OPAC  search  for  users.  University  libraries  are  quite  liberal  in  the  provision  of  printers  as  the  range  of  printers  varies  from  4  in  GNDU  to  32  in  HAU  and  most  of  the  libraries  extend  printing  facility  to  users  also.  Except HPKV and UJ all the libraries have barcode  scanners.  
Five  university  libraries,  viz,  PUC,  AS&T,  UK,  UJ and PbiU have adopted RFID systems, but only  PUC and UJ have PDA for utilising RFID potential.  Most of the libraries have installed CCTV cameras.  All  the  libraries  have  photocopy  machines,  some  even have multiple machines. Seven libraries have  been  using  LibSys  software  while  two  have  SOUL.

CLIPS 
Some libraries have multiple library software packages  for different collections. To facilitate bibliographical  information exchange among agricultural university  libraries,  steps  are  being  initiated  for  adoption  of  KOHA.  No  doubt,  there  is  a  great  increase  in  ICT  infrastructure  in  university  libraries  in  the  present  century.  In  2003,  14  central  university  libraries  had  only  169  personal  computers  and  highest  53  systems  were  in  the  University  of  Delhi  with  two  libraries  having  no  system  at  all  and  another  two  libraries  had  only  one  system  each4.  The  libraries  were  still  in  the  process  of  development  of  bibliographic  database  of  their  books  and  other  documents.  By  2003,  the  bibliographic  records  of  only  11.4  %  books  were  prepared  in  the  most  resourceful  central  university  libraries.  Comparing  it  with  present  situation,  today  almost  all  libraries  have completed preparation of bibliographic database  of their collection. Some of the libraries have even  gone  beyond  barcode  based  circulation  to  RFID  systems. These developments in ICT infrastructure  and  its  use  are  quite  encouraging. 
5.4  Library  budget  
Table  5 clearly shows that there is no relationship  between budget allocation for staff salary and library  resources.  Except  AS&T  all  other  libraries  have  more  budget  for  staff  salary  than  for  resources.  However, the ratio of budget for salary and resources

varies  to  a  great  extent.  In  AS&T  the  budget  for  staff  salary  is  less  than  that  of  resources  (ratio  0.78)  whereas  in  GNDU  budget  for  staff  salary  is  more  than  six  times  of  the  budget  for  resources.  In  KUK,  UK  and  UJ,  the  budget  for  staff  salary  is  not  specified,  but  definitely  it  would  be  similar  to  GNDU and PbiU. This budgetary allocation scenario  indicates  that  allocation  for  information  sources  is  very small particularly when one can see that staff  positions  are  not  sufficient. 
5.5  Library  Membership 
Table 6 shows that agricultural university libraries  have relatively smaller membership than the general  universities. Except the universities of J&K, all other  state universities have a membership of more than  10,000,  with  PbiU  having  largest  membership  of  15,738; followed by KUK with 13,455 and PUC with  12,723  members.  Among  agricultural  universities,  PAU  has  largest  number  of  2,290  members  while  AS&T  has  smallest  number  of  887  members.  The  universities  have  generally  increased  the  number  of  courses  and  student  strength  in  each  course  is  also  increased.  This  trend  is  particularly  visible  in  general universities where sometimes simultaneously  two  batches  of  the  same  course  are  started.

5.6  Library  Staff 
The position of library staff (Table 7) is not very  satisfactory. Only 4 of the 12 university libraries have  Librarian’s position filled with a professional person.  Only  PUC  and  UK  have  professional  staff  at  every  level  of  professional  ladder.  The  condition  of  KUK  and HPKV libraries is perhaps the worst where there  is no Librarian, no Deputy Librarian and not even an  Assistant Librarian. Five of the responding libraries  have more than half of the professional positions of  Assistant  Librarian  and  above  vacant.  Overall,  the  total staff strength varies from 10 in AS&T to 92 in  PbiU  library.  This  trend  of  administrative  apathy  is  now  a  common  phenomenon.  In  fact,  the  position  has worsened over the years.The condition of KUK  and  HPKV  shows  a  total  neglect  of  library  by  the  university  administration.  
5.7  Library  Collection 
Books  and  journals  are  the  main  source  of  information in university libraries. The general university  libraries  like  UK  (6.5  Lac),  PUC  (5.77  Lac)  and  UJ  (5  Lac)  have  five  Lac  or  more  books  in  their  collection. The PAU (2.48 Lac) has the largest book  collection among agricultural universities (Table 8).

DJLIT,  VOL.  35,  NO.  4,  JULY  2015 
The  response  about  journals  and  e-journals  varies  mainly  because  some  libraries  included  bound  volumes  of  journals  while  others  only  currently  subscribed  print  journals.  
Among  e-journals  some  libraries  mentioned  only  journals  subscribed  by  them  independent  of  consortium membership while others included those  journals also.The general universities are members

&  Dissertations;  followed  by  another  agricultural  university  library  HAU  (11,632).The  KUK  library  has  the  largest  collection  of  15,328  manuscripts.  Other university libraries with manuscript collection  are  GNDU  (2572),  PUC  (1,493),  PbiU  (850)  and  UK  (400).  The  UK  has  a  small  collection  of  digital  audio  books  (93)  and  Braille  books  (50). 
5.8  Library  Services 
All the libraries endeavour to provide maximum  possible services to their users. In the present study,  all the libraries are providing certain services such  as  readers’  guidance  within  library;  OPAC  search;  reading  room  for  personal  books;  online  search  
by  library  staff  and  users  themselves;  photocopy  service;  book  reservation  and  renewal  services.  Referral  service,  user  orientation  programmes  and  links  to  open  access  resources  are  being  provided  by 11 of the 12 libraries (Table 9). Ten libraries are  having  WebOPAC  and  providing  search  results  by  e-mail,  arranging  documents  through  ILL  service;  and organising book exhibitions. 9 libraries are using  barcode-based circulation systems, while 5  libraries  have  gone  for  RFID  systems.  HPKV  library  is  also  offering  its  online  services  to  off-campus  users.  It  is  interesting  to  see  the  impact  of  ICT  on  library  services as 12 of the 21 services are directly linked  to  use  of  technology  and  4  of  these  services  are  provided by all the university libraries. Thus, as the

DJLIT,  VOL.  35,  NO.  4,  JULY  2015 
ICT infrastructure is increasing in university libraries,  and  user  services  has  also  increased.  
6.    ProbLeMS ANd  FUTUre  PLANS 
Every  organisation  has  problems  of  different  nature.  Some  express  them  while  others  prefer  to  keep  silent.  Only  3  libraries  AS&T,  UJ  and  PAU  mentioned the problems they were facing. All the  3  libraries have the main problem of insufficient staff.  Inadequate  budget,  staff  training,  lack  of  planning,  are  the  other  problems  faced  by  the  university  libraries  of  this  region.The  shortage  of  staff  and  insufficient  budget,  are  the  twin  problems  ailing  Indian  university  libraries  for  decades.  
Four libraries revealed their plans.The PAU and  HPKV  are  planning  to  introduce  RFID  system  in  future,  while  AS&T  is  planning  for  SMS  alert  and  introducing  its  Blog.  The  PUC  library  intends  to  introduce smart card facility for users; subscription  to  new  e-resources;  integration  of  all  departmental  libraries  with  SLIM-21;  and  installing  more  drop  boxes  at  various  points. 
7.    CoNCLUSIoNS 
The  present  study  was  restricted  to  only  state  universities of the states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,  Jammu  &  Kashmir,  Punjab  and  UT  Chandigarh.  But  some  trends  are  quite  visible.  The  libraries  are  facing  administrative  apathy  as  8  out  of  12  libraries are without a professional librarian as head.  Almost  half  of  the  libraries  have  more  than  50  %  vacant  positions  of  Assistant  Librarian  and  above.  In two universities, there is no professional in these  positions. This is very alarming condition and needs  to be addressed immediately. The university libraries  have moved ahead of automation and they are now  recording  their  web  presence  through  WebOPAC,  Blog,  Facebook,  etc.  They  are  acquiring  digital  resources  and  offering  online/ICT-based  services  to  users.

The author acknowledges the efforts of Dr Jivesh Bansal,  PUC; Dr Seema Parmar, HAU; and Mr Joginder Singh,  UJ  in  getting  response  from  the  libraries  included  in  the  present  study.
