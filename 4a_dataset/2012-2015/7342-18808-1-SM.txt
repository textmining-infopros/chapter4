AbstrACt 
An analysis of 2074 papers indexed by Science Citation Index-Expanded and published by different  countries  on  various  aspects  of  Japanese  Encephalitis  (JE)  during  1991  to  2010  indicates  that  JE  is  a  highly  collaborative  discipline  as  judged  by  the  values  of  co-authorship  index  and  the  collaborative  coeffcient for different countries and different sub-felds. Of the total published papers, about two-third  were written in collaboration. Of these, 214 (10 %) were written with local collaboration, 700 (34 %) with  domestic collaboration and 478 (23 %) with international collaboration. Among all the countries, USA is  the most important partner country for all the collaborating countries. The study indicates that the share of  collaborative papers increased almost four times in 2001-2010 as compared to 1991-2000. USA, Japan,  Taiwan and India produced about 70 % of domestically co-authored papers. USA also had the largest  number  (21  %)  of  the  internationally  co-authored  articles. Among  17  highly  collaborative  institutions,  the highest (six) are from India, and Liverpool University (UK) had the highest number of internationally  collaborative papers, followed by Centre of Disease Control and Prevention (USA).

1. INtrODUCtION 
Modern research demands an ever widening range  of skills and is no longer a pursuit of an individual.  Keeping  this  in  view,  Governments  in  different  countries are taking initiatives to enhance contacts  among  scientists  through  collaborative  research  programs,  both  at  the  national  and  international  levels.    Such  initiatives  have  resulted  in  increased  collaborations  at  national  and  international  levels.   For instance, the share of papers written by authors  located  in  two  or  more  different  institutions  rose  from  about  33  %  in  1981  to  50  %  in  1995,  while  the  total  papers  rose  by  about  20  %.    During  the  same period, the share of co-authored papers rose  from  about  6  %  to  15  %1. 
According  to  Beaver  &  Rosen2   collaboration  came  forward  in  response  to  professionalisation  and  increased  knowledge.  Because  of  this,  there  has been an increasing trend towards collaboration  in  almost  all  fields  of  science  and  technology.   However,  the  extent  of  collaboration  and  their  rate  of  growth  vary  from  one  subject  to  another,  one  branch  to  another  branch  of  the  same  subject  and  from  one  country  to  another  country.    
Collaboration  in  research  can  take  a  variety  of  paths.  Based  upon  the  type  of  participants,  their

status, and location, etc., collaboration can broadly  be classified into three categories. These are local,  domestic  and  international  collaboration.  A  local  collaboration  occurs  when  two  or  more  scientists  of  the  same  institute  working  in  different  divisions  work together while a domestic collaboration occurs  when two or more scientists from the same country  engaged in different institutions come together and  international collaborations takes place when two or  more researchers from different countries join hands  to solve a problem. Among these, the international  collaboration  has  received  the  maximum  attention.  International  scientific  collaboration  is  particularly  advantageous for less advanced countries but also  beneficial  for  highly  industrialised  countries3.  
2.   rEvIEw Of  LItErAtUrE 
In the past several studies dealing with collaboration  at national and international level have been published  in literature. For instance, Basu & Kumar4  estimated  the extent of international scientific collaboration of  India for the period 1990-1994, using Science Citation  Index (SCI) and found an increase in collaboration  both  in  terms  of  output  and  the  extent  of  network  and impact. Prakasan5, et al. have also observed that  India’s share in international collaborative publications  

========1========

DJLIT,  VOL.  34,  NO.  3, MAy  2014 
have grown from 4.6 % in 1991 to 22.8 % in 2010.  Gupta6, et al . studied India’s scientific collaboration  with  South  Asian  countries  and  found  that  India  had  strong  collaborative  links  with  Bangladesh  as  compared to Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Gupta  &  Karisiddappa7   studied  collaboration  patterns  in  the specialty of population genetics and found that  highly productive authors are also highly collaborative  and the focus of collaboration is shifting from local  to domestic and international collaboration. Garg &  Padhi8   analysed  collaboration  in  laser  science  and  technology  and  found  that  most  of  the  papers  had  bilateral  domestic  and  international  collaboration.  China, Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland had  higher share of internationally collaborated papers.  He9   examined  international  collaboration  of  G7  countries with China and found that US was the major  collaborator  of  China  among  all  the  G7  countries.

The  present  paper  investigates  the  trends  of  collaboration in Japanese Encephalitis (JE). The JE  is a zoonotic disease caused by an arbovirus and is  transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, which particularly  breed in flooded rice fields. The disease is transmitted  to  man  by  the  bite  of  infected  mosquitoes.  The  clinical  manifestations  of  the  disease  are  rapid  onset of high-grade fever, headache, neck stiffness,  disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and  death. The fatality rate varies between 10-40 % and  those  who  survive  do  so  with  several  neurological  complications. In areas where the JE virus is common,  encephalitis  occurs  mainly  in  young  children,  but  can  also  affect  adults.  The  JE  is  a  leading  cause  of  viral  encephalitis  and  a  significant  cause  of  disability  in Asia  with  30,000-50,000  clinical  cases  reported annually. The distribution of JE is linked to  irrigated rice production combined with pig rearing.  Vaccine for JE is available since 1940 but, has not  reached in many poor countries of Asia, because of  the  lack  of  awareness  of  the  disease  and  its  cost.  An  inexpensive  live-attenuated  vaccine  is  used  in  China,  but  is  not  available  elsewhere.  
In an earlier study10, the authors analysed 2074  papers  published  on  different  aspects  of  Japanese  Encephalitis  (JE)  during  1991  to  2010  and  found  that  the  output  came  from  62  countries  of  which  14  countries  contributed  about  90  %  of  the  total  output.  The  highest  number  of  publications  came  from  USA,  followed  by  India. The  output  increased  manyfolds  since  1991  except  a  significant  dip  in  2005. These papers appeared in 501 journal titles,  which  originated  from  29  different  countries.  87  %  of  the  total  output  was  concentrated  among  15  sub-disciplines and the remaining in other 53 sub- disciplines. Highest output (18 %) was in the sub- discipline of virology. Among the prolific institutions,  the  publication  output  of  institutions  from  the  USA  
242 
and Taiwan had higher impact as compared to other  countries. All the prolific Indian institutes had a low  impact.  The  present  paper  investigates  the  trends  of  collaboration  in  JE.  
Scientific  collaboration  has  been  measured  using  different  parameters.  The  specific  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
• Identify  the  type  of  co-authorship  pattern  to  
calculate  co-authorship  index  and  to  measure  
the  strength  of  co-authorship  among  different  
nations  using  collaborative  coefficient  (CC)  
suggested  by Ajiferuke11; 
• Identify the pattern and magnitude of collaboration  
in  different  sub-specialties  of  JE  and  to  study  
if  it  has  changed  in  two  blocks  of  1991-2000  
and  2001-2010;  
• Study  the  pattern  of  growth  of  collaborative  
research papers during 1991-2010 and how it has  
changed in two blocks of 1991-2000 and 2001-2010;  • Identify  the  magnitude  and  pattern  of  local  
(within the same institute), domestic (within the  
same  country)  and  international  collaboration  
and to measure the domestic and international  
collaborative  index  for  the  identified  nations; • I d e n t i f y   t h e   m o s t   p r o l i f i c   i n s t i t u t i o n s

4.    DAtA AND  MEtHODOLOGY  
The  Science  Citation  Index  Expanded  (SCIE),  a product of Thomson Reuters (formerly Institute of  scientific Information, USA), was used as the source  of data for the present study. The keyword used for  downloading  the  data  was  ‘Japanese  Encephalitis’  in  the  topic  field  for  the  period  1991-2010.  The  search  strategy  yielded  2402  records  that  dealt  with  different  aspects  of  JE  research.  From  these  downloaded records, 162 records were removed that  were  published  as  biography,  meeting  abstracts,  corrections, editorial, news items, proceedings, reprints  and  book  reviews.  Of  the  remaining  2240  records,  166  records  did  not  contain  sufficient  information  like  name  of  the  institution  and  country  and  hence  were  not  included  in  the  analysis.  Thus,  the  total  number of papers included in the analysis was 2074  published by different countries. Bibliographic details  for each record included author(s) and their affiliation.  Data  was  later  enriched  with  the  count  of  total  authors,  type  of  collaboration  (local,  domestic  and  international). Papers contributed by 3 or 4 authors  were  clubbed  together  as  multi-authored  and  the  rest with more than 4 contributors as mega authored  papers. Indicators used for measuring co-authorship  and  collaboration  have  been  described  as: 4.1  Collaborative  Coefficient  (CC) 
The measure has been suggested by Ajiferuke11 and  is  based  on  fractional  productivity  defined

CC=1- 
j =1 
N 
Here, Fj denotes the number of j  authored research  
4.4 International  Collaborative  Index  (ICI) 
The value of ICI has been obtained by calculating  proportional  output  of  internationally  co-authored  papers.    
ICI  =  {(Ii/Iio)  /  (Io   /I 
oo 
  )}  x100  
where,  
Ii  = Number of internationally co-authored papers 
papers; N  denotes total number of research papers  
                for  country  i,    
Iio=  Total  output  for  country i, 
Io  = Number of internationally co-authored papers 
                for  all  countries,  
published; and k  is the greatest number of authors  per  paper.  
According to Ajiferuke11, CC tends to zero as single  authored papers dominate and to 1-1/j as j-authored  
Ioo=  Total  output  for  all  countries.  
Here,  'all'  implies  all  countries  included  in  the  
papers dominate. This implies that higher the value

of  CC,  higher  the  probability  of  multi  or  mega  authored  papers. 
4.2 Co-authorship  Index  (CAI) 
This has been suggested by Garg & Padhi8  and is  obtained by calculating proportional output of single,  two,  multi  and  mega-authored  papers  for  different  nations and for different sub-specialties of JE. The  methodology is similar to one suggested by Price13 and used to calculate Activity Index (AI) suggested by  Frame14 and  elaborated  by  Schubert  and  Braun15. 
CAI  =  {(Nij/Nio)/(Noj/Noo)}x100  
where, 
Nij =  Number  of  papers  having  j -authors  from  
            country  i, 
Nio   =  Total  output  of  country  i, 
Noj   =  Number  of  papers  having  j-authors  from  
                    all  countries, 
Noo   =  Total  output  for  all  countries  and 
j   =  1,  2,  (3,  4),  and  (>5)  
Here,  'all'  implies  all  the  countries  included  in  the  study.  
CAI = 100 implies that a country's co-authorship  effort for a particular type of authorship corresponds  to the world average, CAI > 100 reflects higher than  average  co-authorship  effort,  and  CAI  <  100  lower  than average co-authorship effort by that country for  a given type of authorship pattern. The measure is  different than what has been suggested by Bordons16.  4.3 Domestic  Collaborative  Index  (DCI) 
This measure is obtained by calculating proportional  output  of  domestically  co-authored  papers.  For  calculating DCI, papers written in local and domestic  collaboration  have  been  added  together.  
DCI  =  {(Di/Dio)/(Do/Doo)}x  100  
where,  
Di = Number of domestically co-authored papers  
         for country  i , 
Dio =  Total  output  for  country i, 
Do  = Number of domestically co-authored papers 
                  from  all  countries,  
Doo   =  Total  output  for  all  countries. 
Here,  'all'  implies  all  countries  included  in  the  study.  
The  value  of  DCI  or  ICI  =  100  indicate  that  a  country’s  collaborative  effort  corresponds  to  world  average.  DCI  or  ICI  >  100  reflects  collaboration  higher  than  world  average  and  DCI  or  ICI  <  100  reflects  collaboration  less  than  world  average.

5.1  Co-authorship  Index  and  Collaborative  
Coefficient  for  Different  Nations 
Table  1  presents  the  distribution  of  output  by  single, two, multi, and mega-authored papers besides  the values of the CAI and CC for each country. The  average  value  of  CC  for  JE  is  0.68.  This  implies  that  the  collaborative  pattern  in  the  field  of  JE  is  characterised  by  co-authored  papers  and  not  by  single  authored  papers.  Table  1  indicates  that  Japan,  Taiwan,  China,  Thailand,  South  Korea  and  Brazil  had  more  than  average  value  of  CC  (0.68).   It  implies  that  these  countries  must  have  higher  values  of  CAI  either  for  multi  or  mega-authored  papers. Table 1 indicates that of the above listed six  countries, Japan, China, Thailand and South Korea  had  the  highest  values  of  CAI  for  mega-authored  papers while Taiwan and Brazil had the highest value  for  multi-authored  papers. Among  all  the  countries  listed  in  Table  1,  Singapore  and  Germany  had  the  lowest  value  of  CC.  This  is  also  reflected  by  the  high  values  of  CAI  for  single  authored  papers.            
Authors also calculated how the pattern of co- authorship has changed during two blocks i.e. 1991- 2001  and  2001-2010.  The  results  of  the  analysis  are  given  in  Table  2.  It  indicates  that  in  absolute  terms  the  number  of  multi  and  mega  authored  papers  have  increased  significantly  in  the  second  block of 2001-2010 as compared to the first block of  1991-2000.  However,  as  reflected  by  the  values  of  CAI  for  different  type  of  authorship  pattern  for  two  blocks, there appears to be no significant change in  the  pattern  of  co-authorship  during  the  two  blocks  of study. This is also reflected by the values of CC  which  are  same  for  both  the  blocks.  
Data  was  analysed  to  examine  the  pattern  of  co-authorship in different sub-disciplines of JE. The

results  of  the  analysis  are  presented  in  Table  3.  It  indicates  that  the  highest  value  of  CC  is  for  S12  (public,  environmental  and  occupational  health).  This  is  also  indicated  by  the  highest  value  of  co-

single and two authored papers. For the remaining  sub-disciplines  the  value  of  CC  is  almost  equal  to  the average, which again indicates that the field is  characterised  by  co-authored  papers.  
5.2  Pattern  of  Growth  of  Domestic  and  
International  Collaborative  Papers 
Authors  also  analysed  how  the  volume  of  domestically and internationally co-authored papers  changed during the period of study. Table 4 presents  the distribution of papers published in domestic and  international  collaboration  during  1991-2000  and  2001-2010. It indicates that during the first decade  (1991-2000)  only  about  14  %  papers  appeared  as  a  result  of  collaborative  research.  Of  these  10  %  were  in  domestic  collaboration  and  the  remaining  4 % in international collaboration. In the later decade  there  was  a  steep  rise  in  the  share  of  domestic  and international collaborative research papers and  these  constitute  about  53  %  of  the  total  research  output.  Of  these,  the  share  of  domestic  papers  was  about  34  %  and  the  rest  were  in  international  collaboration. Data indicates that the share of both  domestically  as  well  as  internationally  co-authored  papers reached a peak during 2008-2010. The share  of domestically co-authored papers published in these  three years is about 30 % of the total domestically  published  papers.  Similar  trend  is  observed  for  internationally  co-authored  papers  and  the  share  of  internationally  co-authored  papers  during  last  three years is about 40 % of the total internationally  co-authored  papers.

co-authored  papers  during  1991-2010  which  also  indicates a steep rise in domestic and international  collaborative  papers  in  the  later  block.  
5.3  Domestic  and  International  Collaborative  
Profile  according  to  Different  Nations  
The  results  of  Domestic  Collaborative  Index  (DCI)  and  International  Collaborative  Index  (ICI),  besides,  the  absolute  number  of  papers  for  each  country  written  in  local,  domestic  and  international  collaboration  are  given  in Table  5.  It  indicates  that  out  of  2074  papers  published  by  different  nations,  about  two-third  were  written  with  local,  domestic and international collaboration. Of these, 214 (10 %)  were  written  with  local  collaboration,  700  (34  %)  with  domestic  collaboration  and  478  (23  %)  with  international  collaboration.  The  number  of  papers  written in domestic collaboration is almost twice the  number of papers written in international collaboration.  Similar  results  have  been  obtained  by  Bordons16 in  their  study  on  local,  domestic  and  international  collaboration for biomedical research. Among all the  countries  listed  in  Table  5,  USA  had  the  highest  number  (25  %)  share  of  domestically  co-authored  papers followed by Japan (16 %), Taiwan (15 %) and  India  (14  %). These  four  countries  produced  about  70  %  of  domestically  co-authored  papers.  Among  these four countries Taiwan had the highest value of  DCI. Austria, Germany and England had the lowest  value of DCI, because the share of domestically co- authored  papers  for  these  countries  is  very  small.  
Further  analysis  of  the  raw  data  indicates  that  like domestically co-authored papers, USA also had  the largest number (21 %) of the internationally co- authored  articles.  Four  European  countries  namely  England,  France,  Austria  and  Germany  together  constituted  about  19  %  of  the  internationally  co- authored  articles.  Among  these  countries  England  had  the  highest  (12.5  %)  share  of  internationally  collaborative papers. Seven Asian countries (India,  Japan,  Taiwan,  China,  Thailand,  South  Korea,  and  Singapore)  together  constituted  about  one-third  of  the internationally co-authored articles. Among these,  Thailand  and  China  had  8  %  and  6  %  share  of  internationally co-authored papers. Further analysis  of data indicate that England had the highest value  of  ICI  among  European  countries,  while  among  Asian  countries  Thailand  had  the  highest  value  of  ICI.  Raw  analysis  of  data  indicates  that  among  all  the  countries  USA  is  the  most  important  partner  country  for  all  the  countries  listed  in  Table  5. 
Papers published in local, domestic and international  collaboration originated from 679 institutions spread  all over the world. Of these 574 (84.5 %) belonged  to  prolific  countries  listed  in  Table  1  and  the  rest  
igure  1.  Year-wise  distribution  of  domestic  and  
105  were  scattered  in  other  countries.  Among  the

prolific countries USA had the highest (159) number  of institutions followed by India (74), Japan (68), and  Australia  (51).  Table  6  lists  17  highly  collaborative  institutions. Of these six are from India, three each  from  USA  and  Japan,  two  from  Taiwan  and  one  each from England, Thailand, and Australia. Out of  
17, 8 are academic institutions and the rest 10 are  research institutions. These institutions contributed  366  papers  in  local,  domestic  and  international  collaboration, which constituted about one-fourth of  the papers written in collaboration and the rest three- fourth  of  the  papers  were  produced  by  remaining

6.    CONCLUsIONs 
Using different co-authorship and collaboration  indicators,  the  study  identified  the  pattern  of  co- authorship and collaboration among different countries  engaged  in  Japanese  Encephalitis  (JE)  research.  The  study  indicates  that  the  collaborative  pattern  in  the  field  of  JE  is  characterised  by  multi  and  mega  authored  papers  and  not  by  single  authored  papers.  Only  Singapore  and  Germany  had  less  number  of  multi  and  mega  authored  papers,  while  Japan,  Taiwan,  China,  Thailand,  South  Korea  and  Brazil had more number of multi and mega-authored  papers.  As  judged  by  the  values  of  collaborative  coefficient  it  is  observed  that  the  sub-discipline  of  public,  environmental  and  occupational  health  had  more number of mega authored papers as compared  to  other  sub-fields.  Papers  published  in  domestic  collaboration are almost twice the papers written in  international collaboration. Proportion of domestically  as well as internationally co-authored papers increased  significantly in 2001-2010 as compared to 1991-2000.  The study also indicates that among all the countries  USA is the most partner collaborating country for all  countries involved in JE research. Highest numbers  of  collaborating  institutions  are  from  India  and  Liverpool  University  (UK)  had  the  highest  number  of  internationally  collaborative  papers  followed  by  Centre  of  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  (USA).
