 An eminent scientist, Dr Atul H. Chokshi, Professor in the Department of Materials Science, Indian  Institute  of  Science  (IISc),  Bangalore,  India  has  published  76  research  papers  in  reputed  international  journals, and 34 articles in conference proceedings. These publications have received 2820 citations, and  he is listed among the top 100 most cited authors in Materials Science. His research domains include  Superplastics,  Creep,  Deformation,  and  Grain  growth. Average  annual  scientifc  productivity  is  four  research papers and his research papers have received an average of 113 citations every year.  Average  number of citations per paper is 26. The 50-percentile productivity life is 13 at the age of 39 years, and  productivity co-effcient is 0.50. Average self-citation rate is 11.5 % of the total citations.  Seven most-cited  papers account for 44.54 % of total citations received, and these papers have received citations within  a year of their publication. Average number of authors per paper is 2.2 and collaboration co-effcient is  0.88,  indicating  high  degree  of  collaboration.  He  has  collaborated  extensively  with T.G.  Langdon, A.K.  Mukherjee, D.M. Owen, M.A. Meyers, and J.R. Peters to publish 44 research papers and these papers  have received 1680 citations (59.5 % of total citations). UK and USA were the most preferred countries  for research collaboration. Journal of American Ceramic Society  and  Scripta Materialia  were the most- preferred  journals  to  publish  research  fndings. A  single  article  published  in Materials  Science  and  Engineering R–Reports, with an impact factor of 04.79 has been cited 207 times, which is the highest  number of citations any of his research papers have received. With these achievements, Atul H. Chokshi  is a role model for emulation among younger generation of scientists. 
Keywords: Atul H. Chokshi, materials science, scientometric study, biobibliometric study 
1. INtRODUCtION 
Scientists,  as  creators  of  information,  play  a  significant  role  in  the  advancement  of  Science.   Scientific publications provide the best available basis  for  measuring  the  research  output  of  a  scientist,  an  institution  or  a  nation.  Shockley1   first  used  the  publications for measuring the research productivity  among individuals within a group by analysing their  publications.  Lotka2   stated  in  his  ‘Inverse  square  law  of  scientific  productivity’  that  highly  productive  authors  form  a  very  small  proportion  of  the  total  in  any  given  field  of  research.  On  the  other  hand,  impact  of  publications  of  a  scientist  is  measured  in  terms  of  number  of  citations  received  by  these  publications.  A  publication  that  is  never  read  can  have  little  impact.    Hence,  study  of  the  scientific  productivity and impact of eminent scientists can throw  light on the pattern of  scholarly communication  in  
a  given  discipline,  and  can  also  stimulate  younger  generation  to  emulate  them.  An  attempt  is  made  to  present  the  results  of  analysis  related  to  the  scientific productivity, authorship, and collaborative  authorship pattern, countries and scientists preferred  to  collaborate,  and  impact  of  research  of  Atul  H.  Chokshi,  Professor  of  Materials  Science,  IISc,  Bangalore,  India.

3. LItERAtURE  REVIEW  
Individuals  are  the  basic  foundation  of  any  institution.  A study of scientific productivity and impact  of  research  of  individuals  with  significant  scientific  achievements can help in understanding the dynamics  of  scholarly  communication  and  may  stimulate  the  younger  generation  to  emulate  them. 
Tiew5   presented  an  analysis  of  the  publication  productivity,  authorship  pattern,  channels  of  communication,  journal  preference  and  language  preference of Khoo Kay Kim, Professor of Malaysian  history in the University of Malaysia, Kaula lampur.A  bio-bibliometric  study  by  Koley  &  Sen6,  in  their  study  finds  that  the  data  do  not  follow  Bradford’s  distribution.  Citation  analysis  of  H.J.  Bhabha  has  been undertaken by Swarna7, et al. and  Kademani8,  Bio-bibliometric  study  by  Parvathamma9,  et  al.  highlights  the  achievements  of  T.A.  Aminabhvi,  which  includes  publication  of  151  research  papers  with  collaborative  co-efficient  of  0.9,  important  collaborators,  and  collaborating  countries.

is 26. 50-percentile productivity life is the productive  age  at  which  half  of  the  research  publications  were published. Productivity co-efficient is the ratio  of  productive  life  (corresponding  to  50-percentile  productivity)/total productive life26. The 50-percentile  productivity  life  of  Atul  H.  Chokshi  was  13  at  39  years  of  age.  Hence,  the  productivity  co-efficient  amounts  to  0.50.  
6.4 Self-Citations 
Self-citation means the author citing his own work.  Self-citations are the significant means of promoting  scholarly reputation and gaining professional credit  for one’s research. They also indicate the continuity  of  one’s  own  research.  Self-citations  account  for  10-20  %  of  all  references,  but  it  differs  between  disciplines,  from  15  %  in  physical  sciences  to  6  %  in  sciences34,35.  Among  2820  citations  received  by  the  research  papers  of  Atul  H.  Chokshi,  325  are  self-citations  (11.52  %)  (fig.  1).
