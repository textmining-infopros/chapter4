ABSTRACT
The purpose of this paper is to investigate and determine the different challenges faced by the searchers
of online database in selected central university libraries in India. Eight central universities in India were chosen
on the basis of the bandwidth utilisation (higher to lowest in each group). A total of 302 library users filled
in the questionnaires (out of 320 approached) in the survey all eight central university libraries across India.
It finds that easy and understandable content pages are the most desirable by the users; site feasibility is
directly proportional to users interaction; and the retrieval techniques vary from subject to subject. This paper
affirms that the databases should be selected on the basis of their retrieval aspects and the online features.
The publisher of the online databases can not overlook the retrieval features in the databases. Easy and simple
retrieval features can fetch more subscribers for the vendors and publishers. This is a comprehensive study
that provides statistical data on searching/retrieval problem of online databases in different central universities
in India.
Keywords: Retrieval command, online databases, central university, India

1. INTRODUCTION
Ease of use and efficiency of an information retrieval
system (IRS) is ordinarily measured in terms of its user
friendliness, and recall and relevant ratios. Indeed it also
depends on the search strategy, query formulation skills
and confidence of the online searcher as well as the
inherent features of the IRS and the databases.
This study finds out existing trends in IR features and
different data retrieval techniques required for success in
searching different databases subscribed or provided
access to by the Indian central university libraries. This
study is confined to a select old and established eight
central university libraries (Table 1) across the length and
breadth of the country:
Of these eight universities the four, namely, DU,
IGNOU, JMI, and JNU are in the National Capital Region
while other four represent South (PU), North–East (AU),
North Central (BHU) and East (VBU). At the time of study,
there was no central university in the North West India.

This gives fair representation to all the regions of the
country. Further, these eight universities were chosen on
the basis of ranking and grouping their bandwidth
utilisation (as taken from the Inflibnet, Ahmadabad
website (www.inflibnet.ac.in). Two universities in each
group representing the highest and the lowest network

2. OBJECTIVES OF STUDY
The aim of this study was to examine the data
retrieval techniques as offered and made available by
database providers, and users expectations and their
feedback on these issues. The main objectives of the
study were to:

•

identify different accessibility features of the online
databases;

•

find out different aspects of the feasibility of the sites
of the online databases;

•

identify different browsing features of the online
databases;

•

recognise different menu driven or command oriented
retrieval techniques of an online database;

•

evaluate the data retrieval techniques on the basis of
the performance of the online databases;

•

propose ranking of online databases on the basis of
adaptability of data retrieval techniques; and

•

identify the university libraries using maximum online
databases.

3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
A brief literature survey was done to develop a basic
understanding of the problem, and to design appropriate
questionnaires. Various aspects taken up by the previous
researchers1-12 helped us to approach the problem in a
holistic manner and become clear in objectives of the
present study.
For the present study detailed information was
collected through two sets of questionnaires, one for the
library staff and the other for the users. For data collection
investigator directly contacted all the possible information
scientists employed by these university libraries, and
made a convenient sample of 320 users of databases in
these libraries. Throughout the data collection process
60

one author personally visited all the eight libraries, and the
questionnaire was administered personally to the
librarians/information scientists and the users. Personal
visits provided a vivid and clear picture of the prevailing
situation and provided a chance to explain the objectives
of the study and clarify any perceived ambiguity in the
questionnaires to the respondents and faculty. Out of 320
respondents approached only 298 cooperated making a
high return rate of 93 per cent. In order to supplement the
data informal discussions were also carried out with the
all these online users. This modus operandi alone helped
to have deep insights into the prevailing conditions.
Respondents revealed very useful information which
otherwise could not have been known. The data was
analysed manually and also with the help of software
packages like Excel and SPSS.

4. SCOPE
Out of the eight universities surveyed, seven are
members of the UGC-INFLIBNET consortium whereas the
IGNOU is subscribing to 17 databases of its own, and is
not a member of the above consortium. The 116
databases are of the following form: Bibliographic-15; Ebooks-29; Full-text journals-72.
These databases are from the following venders/
publishers: American Chemical Society (ACS), American
Institute of Physics (AIP), Annual Reviews (AR),
Blackwell Publishing (BWP), Cambridge University Press
(CUP), Institute of Physics (IOP), Institute of Studies in
Industrial Development (ISID), J-Gate Customs Content
Consortia (JCCC), JSTOR, Oxford University Press
(OUP), Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC), Society for
Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), SpringerLink
(SL), and Taylor & Francis (T&F). Of the 116 databases,
strangely enough, only one database, namely, Project
Muse (muse.inu.edu) was subscribed to by all the
libraries, while 69 database were subscribed by only one
university each. For the academic libraries the two most
important consortia are UGC-Inflibnet and AICTE-Indest.
All the libraries, except IGNOU, have consortia-based
databases and some have self-subscribed, too. The DU
and JNU have in-house grown databases also. The DU is
also a member of the AICTE-Indest consortia, though it is
mostly meant for professional and engineering institutes.
All the universities use both the commercial and the
open source databases. Earlier net servers and CD-ROM
mirror servers were very popular among the universities,
but now university libraries under study are no more
offering CD-ROM services. Multimedia databases are
available only in DU and JNU, while all the eight libraries
own and provide access to full-text and bibliographic
databases. All libraries have self-subscribed as well as
consortia-based databases, whereas the DU and JNU
have also developed in-house databases. Being
traditional and general universities under the purview of
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

the UGC, all are members of the UGC-Infonet consortium.
But DU in addition is also a member of the AICTE-Indest
consortia.

The study found that only DU, BHU, IGNOU, and JNU
are hosting open access databases on their websites.
Most of the universities allow online access to databases
either through their intranets or directly from the web.
Experienced librarians prefer the campus-wide facility for
providing access to databases.

The AU, IGNOU, Jamia, JNU, and Viswa Bharti allow
access through campus-wide intranets or internet with
identification and password. Desktop remote access to
university resources is preferred by busy scholars.
Further, it was found that AU, BHU, DU, JNU, PU and
Viswa Bharti allow IP-enabled access while IGNOU
databases are password-based.

5. DATA RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES
Though a common retrieval command is easy, but it
does not provide access to all the databases. Some of the
universities provide common links to databases through
federated search. But only the DU has the federated
search engine GISTfind. In this survey, only the DU and
PU revealed their online search techniques while the other
libraries preferred silence on the issue.
The DU uses Boolean, interactive, and proximity
searches, while the PU uses quick search, simple
search, advance Boolean search, in addition to menudriven searches, as provided by their vendors.
Accordingly, both these libraries are providing facilities for
further refinement of large chunks of search output to
make more precise and relevant search. However, none of
the universities is using data mining technique.

Indeed, the information retrieval techniques vary from
university to university. It depends upon both internal and
external factors of a database. In the questionnaire about
48 aspects or facilities for information retrieval were
identified (Table 3) and the users of these eight libraries
were asked to mark their ease of use on the Lickert scale
as: Essay-3; Challenging-2; Difficult-1.

It is clear that some aspects and component of IRS
are complex and difficult. The library workers have not
only to learn them thoroughly but also have to make their
users familiar with them. To overcome the problem, one
requires:
(a) Online training and library orientation of users
(b) Asking the vendors to supply the databases in easy
formats

6. FINDINGS

Most significant finding can be stated nearly as an
axiomatic law: ‘In online databases usability is mainly
influenced by the ease of data retrieval features: more
efficient the techniques, more the use of online
databases.’ There is an efficient co-relation between
facilities and usability of an online database. The usability
percentage was highest in Project Muse followed by
Emerald, JSTOR, and Elsevier.
In addition, marketing, education, and organisation
are factors to reckon with to maximise the use of library
resources among the patrons.

6.1 Results
Awareness and convenience seem to be major factors
in selection of resources, whether prints or electronic.

Easy and understandable content page was the most
desired features by the users. Most of the features are
common in online databases, but the JSTOR is ranked
most efficient online database in browsing features.
Project Muse was rated by majority of the users as the
best system in terms of retrieval features. They
experienced having better control in searching using
natural language terms.

Majority of users prefer remotely-accessed online
resources to the printed ones. Faculty, and to a large
extent students, access the resource remotely rather
than in the library. However, they use only a small portion
of the available information sources. Users tend to select
a limited number of databases and seem to be unaware of
the availability of broad spectrum of databases other than
what they use regularly.

Feasibility of the site of online databases is directly
proportional to its interactive quality. Hence, again it was
rated as the most efficient online database is JSTOR,
while the last ranked is Taylor & Francis in this regard.

Findings suggest that databases without links to fulltext databases have lower use. Likewise librarians should
also consider selecting databases that provide full-text
links to their online collection in a seamless manner.

It was assumed and sunsequently found correct that
in subject-based online databases there is a significant
difference in the retrieval features among the sciences,
social sciences, and multidisciplinary databases.
Certainly, it is not true of multidisciplinary databases with
advanced retrieval features.

Promotion of the online catalogue as a single-window
to access both online and print journals would encourage
their users based on need rather than convenience.

It was found that retrieval techniques vary from subject
to subject. There is some significant difference to apply all
the retrieval features to a simple online database. Different
search features vary in different online databases. For
example, ‘use and application of wildcard’ is highest in
Elsevier databases, but it is lacking in Blackwell
Publishing.

Most respondents indicated that they were aware of
their library’s web home page; and they probably used it
to navigate to the library resources.

Further, the feature ‘use of thesaurus or permuted
index for searching’ is present in all the databases except
in Elsevier and Institute of Physics databases. Its highest
percentage was recorded in the American Chemical
Society. ‘lateral search’ and ‘fuzzy search’ also widely
vary in databases. The ‘concept maps’, ‘range search’,
‘fuzzy search’, ‘special character search’, and ‘hyphen
search’ are mostly recorded best in natural science
subjects. On the other hand, ‘lateral search’, ‘free text
search’ are recorded very high in social sciences, arts,
and humanities.
62

The ogranisation of online resources is also of
paramount importance for optimum use of online journals
and databases.

6.1.1 Difficulties Faced by Users
All users mentioned that they needed some help for
search query formulation, selection of search terms, and
they expected the system to provide ‘suggested
keywords and suggested search strategy’ features.
Difficulties faced by the users in utilising the retrieval
features were related to the applications of the retrieval
features. A complete understanding of the retrieval
features is not easy as these vary from system to
system. For instance users, specially the freshers, faced
difficulties in finding synonyms from the online thesaurus.
The thesaurus only displays broader term (BT), narrower
term (NT), related term (RT), and many users could not
self-translate the search strategy with synonyms and
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

pseudo-synonyms. Users were observed to be struggling
to come up with the appropriate search terms.
Majority of the online databases vendors listed some
features in the help menu which were not available in the
databases, e.g., automatic translation software, facility to
browse subject authority file, facility to suggest subject
headings, number of times an article has been cited, and
the spell check. Advanced users who were enthusiastic to
experiment with unique features were completely
frustrated to find those features non-existing. Apart from
the features ‘Help’ or ‘Tutorial’, users also expected to
see some search examples before starting. They required
the search Help Menu and Guide to give simple
instructions and offer examples for command.
Other problem was of connectivity while conducting
retrieval tasks. A database suddenly became
inaccessible due to some subscription-related conditions.
The users had to re-login after leaving the home-page idle
for some minutes.

6.1.2 User Education
To ease their difficulties, the users especially the
teachers, need guidance and training in using online
databases. The information literacy unit or the library staff
should conduct training sessions for academic staff and
researchers on the campus. If the teachers find the tools
helpful then they would promote it among their students. It
would be sensible to have a guide to library home pages
that are targeted to different levels of users of different
depth of engagement. Ease of use also depends upon the
education, training, experience, institutional settings,
personal traits, and attitude of the users. Certainly,
dedicated staff is needed for online training of library
users. Indeed there are UGC-funded posts of information
scientist in universities. But mostly they are from
computer sciences and as such they are not conversant
with the spirit, philosophy, and idioms of library service.
Therefore, there is an urgent need of an online librarian to
manage, serve, and assist in dissemination of eresources of a library.

7. EPILOGUE
Though the design of library databases is in a
permanent flux, yet hopefully, these findings may guide
the databases and interface designers in the development
of easily accessible products. This study may help
librarians to make better procurement decisions and
challenge vendors through specific questions about the
functionality of their wares. Further, there is a need to

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

periodically repeat such studies. The changing usepattern will require libraries to re-examine their collection
development policies, institutional programmes, and
reference service to meet the information needs of their
patrons in the online environment.
