The  paper  gives  an  account  of  the  origin  and  development  of  the  Open Access  Initiative    and  explains the concept of open access publishing. It also highlight various facets related to the open access  scholarly publishing in the feld of Media & Communication on the basis of data collected from the most  authoritative online directory of open access journals, i.e., Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).  The DOAJ covers 8492 open access journals of which 106 journals are listed under the subject heading  ‘Media  &  Communication’.  Most  of  the  open  access  journals  in  Media  &  Communication  were  started  during  late  1990s  and  are  being  published  from  34  different  countries  on  6  continents  in  13  different  languages. More than 80 % open access journals are being published by the not-for-proft sector such  
as academic institutions and universities.

 media and communication 
1.  intrOduCtiOn  
Scholarly  communication  is  often  used   interchangeably  with  the  term  scholarly  publishing.  Scholarly communication is the process of academics,  scholars and researchers sharing and publishing their  research findings so that they are available to the wider  academic community (such as university academics)  and beyond1. It includes both the dissemination  and  access  to  scholarship  and  research  in  a  variety  of  formats and states of completion, such as published  books or journal articles, research results and data  sets,  and  drafts  of  papers2.  Research  is  basically  funded  by  public.  But  a  publically-funded  research  is  not  allowed  for  the  public.  They  have  to  pay  for  it  again.  Scientists  disseminate  the  results  of  their  research through journals. The traditional system of  publishing provides an obstacle in the dissemination  of  research  findings  due  to  its  pricing  policies.  Dwindling  budgets,  and  high  cost  of  journals  are  making libraries unable to purchase a good number  of  journals.  In  the  present  scenario,  libraries  are  cutting  the  subscription  of  journals.  Internet  has  changed the traditional scholarly publishing system  and  a  new  system  of  scholarly  discourse  has  emerged, i.e., open access (OA) publishing system,  which  promises  to  give  extreme  advantages  to  the

researchers,  educational  institutions,  and  libraries,  particularly,  those  which  have  acute  shortage  of  resources  for  purchasing  scholarly  literature.  The  OA  movement  has  gained  substantial  popularity  in  developed countries and many developing countries  are  also  taking  interest  in  this  movement.  This  movement  is  supported  by  different  bodies  such  as  Scholarly  Publishing  and  Academic  Resources  Coalition  (SPARC),  Open  Access  Initiative  (OAI),  Open Society Institute (OSI), Public Library of Science  (PLoS),  etc.  With  the  three  important  declarations,  i.e., Budapest, Bethesda, and Berlin, this movement  has  gained  momentum  since  20033.  
2. COnCEPt   OF  OPE n  ACCESS 
By open access, one means the free and immediate  availability  on  the  public  internet  of  those  works  which scholars give to the world without expectation  of  payment-permitting  any  user  to  read,  download,  copy, distribute, print, search or link to the full-text  of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them  as data to software or use them for any other lawful  purpose4. The goal of the OA movement is to make  scholarly  literature  freely  available  in  digital  form  worldwide with minimal restrictions in their use. The  present study is an attempt to identify the trends of

OA publishing (particularly OA journals) in the field  of  media  and  communication.  It  will  be  helpful  for  media  librarians  as  well  as  subject  professionals  to  get  aware  of  the  availability  of  OA  journals  in  the  field  of  Media  &  Communication. 
3.    r ESEArCH  PrO bLEM 
Despite  of  several  directories  of  OA  journals  on internet (e.g. Directory of Open Access Journals  (DOAJ))  and  search  engines  for  searching  article  from  OA  journals  (e.g.  Open  J-Gate),  the  people  are  unaware  of  the  availability  of  OA  journals  in  different  disciplines.  Different  movements  are  undertaken to promote the use of OA journals. There  is  a  large  and  growing  body  of  fully  OA  journals  in  the  field  of  Media  and  Communication.  The  DOAJ  listed  106  titles  under  the  subject  heading  ‘Media  &  Communication’  at  the  time  of  data  analysis  (i.e., on 15 December 2012). Several studies were  conducted in different disciplines on the availability  of  OA  journals  and  their  impact  factor,  but  none  of  the  study  has  been  undertaken  to  investigate  OA  journals  in  Media  &  Communication. This  is  an  area  where  researchers  are  needed  to  know  the  availability and trends of OA journals publishing. The  present study is useful for the librarians as well as  subject  concerned  professionals  to  understand  the  various facets related to OA scholarly publishing in  the  field  of  Media  &  Communication.

Review  of  related  literature  has  always  been  essential for research. According to Ali5,  “literature  review  is  a  comprehensive  survey  of  the  works  published in a field of study, or related to a particular  line of research, usually in the form of a bibliographic  essay  or  annotated  list  of  references  in  which  attention  is  drawn  to  the  most  significant  works”.  Literature  review  provides  the  researcher  with  a  knowledge-base  and  helps  in  identifying  the  gaps  in  the  literature.  
According  to  Prosser6,  the  current  model  of  scholarly communication failed to meet the information  needs of researchers world-wide, while new technology  (in  particular  the  origin  of  internet)  allows  us  to  revise  or  reinvent  scholarly  communication. Anbu7 discusses  the  inadequacies  of  existing  scholarly  publication model, and elaborates on the advantages  of  OA  model  with  particular  reference  to  vertical  portal. Ratnakar8  presents a brief overview of print  journals,  define  OA  movement,  and  explains  the  reason for existence in current scenario. According  to  him,  OA  movement  also  deals  with  promoting  creation of institutional archives and usage of open  source software and digitisation programme. He also  highlighted the area of OA journals and open archives  and  present  limitations  of  OAI  movement.

Nazim  &  Maya  Devi9   highlighted  the  trends  in  OA  publishing  in  India,  as  per  their  study,  among  the top 25 OA publishing countries, India ranks 5th  in  the  list.  Keisham10   describes  the  concept  of  OA  and  highlights  some  of  the  OA  journal  initiatives  in India. Arunachalam11   explains  the  current  status  of  scientific  research  and  progress  made  in  OA  journals,  OA  repositories  and  open  courseware  in  India.  He  has  also  highlighted  that  India  is  feudal  and hierarchical; there exists a wide variation in the  level  engagement  with  science  and  research  and  there  is  a  wide  gap  between  talk  and  action.  The  paper concludes that Indian Institute of Science (IISc)  deposits a large proportion of the papers published  by  its  faculty  and  students  in  the  past  hundreds  years  in  its  e-prints  archive  and  the  Council  for  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  (CSIR)  is  also  adopting the OA policy. Anup Kumar12 discussed how  Indian  OA  Journals  get  international  visibility  with  increased outreach through primary and secondary  open access journal gateways and aggregators. This  paper proposed a model of self-sustainability for OA  journals  as  well  as  for  OA  journal  publishers.       
Lone,  Rather  &  Shah13   revealed  that  India  is  continuously contributing in OA literature as some of  the premier institutions, particularly in the S&T area  which  are  providing  open  access  to  their  research  publications  and  revealed  that  India  is  at  the  7th position  in  the  DOAJ  and  is  sharing  10th   position  with Sweden and Spain in Directory of Open Access  Repositories  (Open  DOAR)  in  terms  of  number  of  repositories in the world. Bhat14  discussed about OA  publishing in premier research institutes of India and  found that the IISc publishes 8.26 % of its research  output  in  OA  journals, All  India  Institute  of  Medical  Sciences 19.37 %, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre  4.84  %,  IIT,  Delhi  3.04  %,  and  IIT,  Kharagpur  3.26  %  of  17,516  research  articles  published  in  4232  journals. Thus, medical institutions are contributing  more of their publications to OA journals as compared  to other institutions. Sawant15  revealed that, 178 OA  journals were peer-reviewed, indexed and abstracted  in  various  indexing  and  abstracting  services,  listed  with  Open  DOAR  and  Open  J-Gate. 
Choudhary & Khode16  analysed 114 OA journals in  Computer Science included in DOAJ. They concluded  that  21  %  of  the  journals  are  published  from  USA  while  only  two  journals  are  published  from  India,  and  English  is  the  most  popular  language  of  the  OA Journals in Computer Science. Agashe, Lihitkar  & Lihitkar17  analysed 48 Business and Management  e-journals  listed  in  the  DOAJ  and  highlighted  that  USA  scored  1st   rank  by  publishing  10  e-journals  followed  by  Brazil.  English  is  the  most  common communication  language  used  by  41  e-journals.  Findings  of  a  study  conducted  by  Sivakumaren18,  et  al.,  indicated  that  most  of  the  OA  Journals  in  the  field  of  Library  &  Information  Science  (LIS)

discipline are published from USA, whereas only 5  OA  journals  are  published  from  India.  English  was  found the most popular language of communication  among  LIS  OA  journals.

6. MEtHOdOLOGY 
For conducting any research, systematic planning  of study is most vital upon which the whole process  of  research  study  depends.  Such  planning  acts  as  a  frame  of  the  guidelines  while  investigating  the  problem.  Since  the  study  was  planned  to  analyse  the  growth  and  present  status  of  OA  journals  in  Media & Communication, survey method was found  suitable. To achieve objectives of the present study,  data was collected from the most authoritative online  directory of open access journals (DOAJ: http://www. doaj.org/).  The  DOAJ  is  designed,  developed  and  maintained  by  Lund  University  which,  as  on  15th December  2012,  listed  8492  open  access  journals  of  which  106  (1.24  %)  journals  were  listed  under  the  subject  heading  ‘Media  and  Communication’.  The  factual  data  were  imported  from  the  website  of  the  DOAJ  in  Microsoft  Excel  format  for  further  analysis  in  terms  of  number  of  journals,  year  and  country  of  origin,  language,  formats,  etc.

7.1 Year-wise  Growth  of  OA  Journals 
The  growth  in  number  of  OA  Journals  during  last  30  years  was  analysed. The  journals  in  Media  & Communication are mostly new journals. Based on  the existence date in DOAJ, there are 5 journals in  1980s, 10 in 1990s, 76 in 2000s and the remaining  15 have started in 2010s. It is to be noted that, the  existence  in  DOAJ  is  not  necessarily  the  year  of  
the  founding  of  the  journal,  as  older  journals  often  have  back  issues  that  have  not  yet  been  digitised  and  placed  online.  Table  1  shows  the  year-wise  growth  of  OA  journals  in  Media  &  Communication.  It  may  be  observed  from  the  year-wise  analysis  of  open access journals that at the end of 1990s there  were a few OA journals in Media & Communication,  but this number rose to 96 at the end of 2009. The  21st   century  saw  a  proliferation  of  OA  journals  in  Media  &  Communication.

are  published  from  34  different  countries  from  6  continents.  South  America  and  North  America  are  the  leading  continents  in  OA  Journals  publishing,  while there is only 1 journal published from African  continent. As  shown  in  Table  2,  highest  number  of  OA  journals  are  published  in  Brazil  (19),  followed  by the United States (16), Spain (12), Australia and  Canada  (5).  Data  presented  in  the  table  indicate  that  86  journals  are  published  from  14  countries,  while  remaining  20  journals  are  published  from  20  countries  with  one  journal  each.  It  is  important  to  note that not a single open access journal in Media  & Communication is published from India. However,  in  LIS,  5  OA  journals  were  being  published  from

Over  two-third  or  73  journals  are  published  by  academic  institutions  and  universities;  about  15  %  are  published  by  associations  and  societies  (15  journals);  and  1  by  a  library  while  17  journals  are  published  by  independent  publishers  and  for- profit corporations (Table 3). The 106 journals have  99  different  publishers;  the  only  seven  publishers  on the list with 2 journals are: Central Queensland  University, Danubius University, University of Texas  at Austin,  Universidade  do  Vale  do  Rio  dos  Sinos,  Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Sammenslutningen  af  Medieforskere  i  Danmark,  and  INTERCOM- Sociedade  Brasileira  de  Estudos  Interdisciplinares  da  Comunicação.

7.4 Language-wise  OA  Journals 
English  is  the  most  prominent  language  of  publishing OA journals in Media and Communication  (Table 4). Out of 106 OA journals, 51 are in English,  followed by Portuguese (21), Spanish (16), and French  (5), 13 languages are represented in publishing 106  open access journals. Language-wise analysis of OA  journals shows a western-centric list of languages,  with only one journal in Persian. This list reflects a  greater cultural diversity, but is still lacking in non- western  representation.  Another  important  finding,  as  emerged  from  the  analysis,  is  that  out  of  106  OA  journals  of  Media  &  Communication,  46  are  published  in  two  or more  languages.  Even there  is  one journal namely ‘CIRCULO de Linguistica Aplicada  a  la  Comunicacion’  in  Spain,  which  is  published  in  8  languages  (Spanish,  English,  French,  German,  Portuguese,  Basque,  Catalan,  and  Italian).

The  OA  journals  are  now  clearly  and  broadly  being recognised as essential vehicle for scholarship  in  the  digital  world.  This  is  evident  based  on  the  continuous growth of OA journals in different disciplines  around  the  world.  The  OA  journals  in  Media  and  Communication were mostly new journals started during  late 1990s and published in 34 different countries of  6 continents, where Brazil tops the rank, followed by  USA,  Spain, Australia  and  Canada.  It  is  surprising  to note that India’s contribution towards OA journals  in Media & Communication is almost nil. At present,  most of the OA journals in Media & Communication  are published from academic institutions particularly  universities. So, it is now time for Indian universities  to take initiatives in publishing OA  journals. At the  same time researchers, lecturers, and practitioners  within  institutions  need  to  convince  the  value  and  immense  potential  of  OA  journals.  The  continued  development  of  OA  journals  depends  a  great  deal  on  our  continuing  to  overcome  cultural,  legal  and  financial barriers to their acceptance and use. Most  of  the  public  funding  research  institutions  in  India  have started providing free access to their journals  over  the  internet.  It  may  be  expected  that  in  the  next  few  years  we  will  see  sustainable  growth  of  OA  Journals  as  some  leading  publishers  are  also  taking  interest  in  OA  journals  publishing.  
in  Media  &  Communication  is  quite  interesting.  Table  9  shows  that  OA  journals  of  Media  and  Communication cover 30 subjects. ‘Communication’  is  the  most  prominent  subject,  which  is  covered
