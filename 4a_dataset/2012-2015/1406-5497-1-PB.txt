ABSTRACT
The present study attempts to evaluate the initiatives taken by India to make this intellectual output accessible
for all by publishing them in open access resources like open access journals and repositories. The results
revealed that India is continuously contributing in open access literature as some of the premier institutions,
particularly in the agriculture sciences. The position of India in terms of number of journals in the Directory
of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is 5th and in Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) India has
11 th place in the world repository.
Keywords: Open access, DOAJ, OpenDOAR, agricultural journals, India, Directory of Open Access Journals

1. INTRODUCTION
The technology that dramatically increases the ability
to record, store, analysis and transmit the information.
“Bethesda statements on open access publishing” states
that open access work meets two criteria; The Author (s)
and Copyright holder (s) to all users a free, irrevocable,
worldwide, perpetual right to access to, and a license to
copy, use, distribute, transmit and display the work
publicity and to make and distribute derivative works, in
any digital medium for any responsible purpose, subject
to proper attribute of authorship, as well as the right to
make small number of printed copies for their personal
use. Open access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of
charge, and free from most copyright and licensing
restrictions. It can be delivered through open access
journals, which perform peer review, or through OA
archives or repositories, which do not. One of the
achievements of the world wide OA movement is to
persuade 80 per cent of non-OA journals to let their
authors deposit the peer-reviewed versions of their work in
OA repositories.

2. OBJECTIVE OF STUDY
The main objective of the study is to evaluate India’s
contribution in the field of agriculture and food science for
delivering open access literature through Directory of

Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and Directory of Open
Access Repositories (OpenDOAR).

3. METHODOLOGY
The literature was reviewed on the open access
movement in India. Then, DOAJ and OpenDOAR were
accessed to get the data related to the study. In the final
stage, the data were interpreted and analysed based on a
set of parameters to get the precise picture of India’s
contribution to agriculture and food sciences in open
access literature.
DOAJ covers free, full-text, and quality-controlled
scientific and scholarly journals. There are now 6080
journals in the directory. Currently, 2582 journals are
searchable at article level. As of 1st Feb 2011, 504526
articles are included in the DOAJ and the OpenDOAR
service provides a quality-assured listing of open access
repositories around the world. OpenDOAR staff harvest
and assign metadata to allow categorisation and analysis
to assist the wider use and exploitation of repositories.
Each of the repositories has been visited by OpenDOAR
staff to ensure a high degree of quality and consistency in
the information provided. OpenDOAR is maintained by
SHERPA services, based at the Centre for Research
Communications at the University of Nottingham.
OpenDOAR has over 1851 listings.

The 68 per cent of India’s repositories in OpenDOAR
are subject specific and only 31 per cent are
multidisciplinary. The subject specific repositories are
mostly related to the science & technology rather than

6. CONCLUSIONS
India becomes an active contributor to global open
access literature by establishing open access archives,
institutional repositories, document-specific repositories,
and subject-specific repositories, and by launching open
access journals and converting subscription-based
journals. The Indian journals in DOAJ have contributed to
10 journals related to agriculture and food sciences are
more in number (4.11 % of total journals). The world
repository in DOAR has contributed to 47 (2.53 %)
repository in Agriculture, Food and Veterinary and Indian
repository (0.16 %) only. Indian researchers are
continuously contributing to open access literature as
some of the premier institutions, particularly in the

58

science and technology area, are providing open access
to their research publications.
