The paper analyses the rankings of 25 most productive Indian universities in overall social sciences  and in its four subfelds, based on various quantitative indicators, such as the total number of papers and  international collaborative papers, qualitative indicators such as the average number of citations per paper  and h-index value, and in terms of new composite indicator (which combines quantitative and qualitative  aspects).  Many  universities  changed  their  ranking  positions,  when  their  ranking  based  on  quantitative  and qualitative indicator is compared with composite indicator. Finally, analysed that the ranking, based  on  composite  indicators,  gives  much  better  results  than  other  indicators  as  it  combines  both  quantity  and quality. The overall ranking of top 25 Indian universities in social sciences give an indicative, if not  nearly comprehensive, assessment of how the social science education is performing as generators of  
new knowledge.

1.    INtRODUctION 
University  rankings  have  gained  popularity,  especially after the launch of Academic Ranking of  World Universities (also known as Shanghai Ranking)  in 2003 and the ranking played an importance role  in  the  growth,  development,  and  management  of  universities.  During  the  last  few  years,  ranking  of  universities,  through  controversial,  have  become  increasing  popular.  Global  university  ranking  are  used  for  variety  of  purposes.  The  governments,  funding  agencies  and  the  media  use  university  rankings  as  a  source  of  strategic  information  on  the  global  competition  among  the  universities. The  university  managers  use  these  university  rankings  as a marketing and decision support tool. Students  and  their  parents  use  this  university  ranking  as  selection  instrument1-2.    
At  the  international  level,  few  major  ranking  in  general  and  in  particular  in  social  sciences  are  available.  The  most  popular  being:  
(i)  Shanghai  Academic  Ranking  of  World  top  50  
universities in social sciences–20123: This ranking  
combines  four  criteria:  Quality  of  education,  
Received 2 April 2014, Online published 20 May 2014 
quality  of  faculty,  research  output,  and  per  
capita  performance;  
(ii)  World  Universities  Rankings:  Social  Sciences  
2012/13 by Times Higher Education4. This ranking  
combines  13  indicators  categorised  into  five  
areas:  Teaching,  research,  citations,  industry  
income,  and  international  outlook;  and (iii)  SCImago  Ranking  of  World  Institutions  (Social  
Science  &  Humanities)5.  This  ranking  employs  
bibliometric data from Scopus database and the  
analysis is based on 6 indicators addressing issues  
like the scientific impact, thematic specialisation,  
output  and  international  collaboration1-2.  
At the national level only few efforts have been  made  on  ranking  Indian  organisations  in  social  sciences.  Stanford  university6   provides  ranking  of  Indian  universities  and  research  institutions  (with  minimum  of  20  publications  in  each  sub-field)  in  four  subject  categories  of  social  sciences,  such  as:  (i)  sociology,  demography  &  family  studies;  (ii) economics, (iii) psychology, and (iv) business &  management, using on two variables, namely, number

of  articles  in  peer  reviewed  journals  and  number  of  citations,  using Thomson  ISI  Web  of  Knowledge  database during 2000-2010. Mukhopadhyay & Sarkar7 rank  economic  departments  of  Indian  universities,  based  on  publications  appearing  in  domestic  and  international  journals.  
These  three  major  global  rankings  in  social  sciences  have  attracted  the  attention  of  policy- makers, the research community, public, and media.  Unfortunately, few Indian universities make it to the  existing  ranking  schemes  that  exist  internationally.  In  these  rankings,  the  emphasis  is  largely  or  even  wholly  on  research  performance.  Consequently,  the  number  of  publications  and  other  bibliometric  elements,  such  as  citations  play  an  important  or  even decisive role. Most of the international ranking  schemes  are  complex  exercises  and  assess  both  quantity and quality of research, but use elitist levels  of  achievement  that  they  cannot  be  meaningfully  applied  in  Indian  context.  Therefore,  for  ranking  purposes  in  this  study,  the  method  and  procedure  suggested by Gangan Prathap8-10  is used for a ranking  of research performance based on quantum of output  and quality of research of various Indian universities  in  social  sciences,  using  bibliographical  data  from  Scopus database. So far, only few ranking of Indian  universities  in  social  sciences  for  their  research  performance  has  been  undertaken.  The  present  paper studies the ranking and performance of Indian  universities in social sciences uses using quantitative  and  qualitative  indicators,  based  on  bibliometric  data  from  international  Scopus  database.  
2. OBJEctIVES 
This  paper  analyses  the  research  performance  of  25  leading  Indian  universities  in  social  sciences  and  in  its  four  sub-fields,  based  on  their  research  output,  citations,  international  collaborative  papers  and a new performance indicator combining research  output  and  quality  during  2008-12.  
3.    MEtHODOLOGY 
The international multidisciplinary bibliographical  database  Scopus11   has  been  used  to  gather  the  necessary data for the study. Based on the data on  social science research in India obtained from Scopus,  the  top  25  Indian  universities  with  comparatively  higher  output  of  publications  during  the  five  years  period  from  2008-12  were  identified.  The  citations  (C)  received  by  papers  (P)  are  considered  for  first  three years (three-year citation window) from the date  of their publications till November 2013. This allows  the average number of citations per paper (C/P) to  be  computed  for  each  of  these  universities  for  the  three  year  citation  window.  The  h-index  for  these  
be determined (TICP) and from this the percentage  share  of  papers  from  international  collaboration  to  the total number of papers published (% TICP) could  be  determined.  There  are  several  ways  of  ranking  performance;  the  simplest  may  be  the  quantity  of  papers  or  citations  (P  or  C)  or  by  citation  quality  or  citation  impact  (mean  citation  rate=C/P)  or  by  a  performance  index  combing  quantity  and  quality  (such as h-index). As suggested by Gangan Prathap,  the  best  single  indicator  which  can  be  used  for  ranking using quality and quantity together, can be  defined  as hm=(C2/P)(1/3).  This  index  is  referred  as  p-index.  For  identifying  papers  in  social  sciences,  the present study paper uses classification, already  existing  in  Scopus  database.  It  has  five  sub-fields  relating  to  social  sciences,  namely  social  science- general, economics, econometrics & finance; business,  management  &  accounting;  decision  sciences;  and  psychology. For deriving data on Indian universities  in social sciences, the output under these five sub- fields  has  been  derived  and  combined.

ANALYSIS 
4.1  Social  Sciences:  University  Ranking 
India  has  published  23481  papers  in  social  sciences during 2008-12, which constitutes 5.86 %  share  of  the  total  Indian  publications  output  during  this  period,  as  indexed  in  Scopus  database.  The  Indian output in social sciences comes from different  type  of  Indian  institutions,  such  as  institutes  of  national importance, research institutes, universities  & colleges, government departments, private bodies,  foreign  aid  agencies,  etc.    
A  total  of  25  universities  with  comparatively  higher  output  of  publications  in  social  sciences  during  a  5-year  period  from  2008  to  2012  were  identified.  These  universities  had  each  published  papers from 55 to 645 during this period, according  to  publication  data  downloaded  from  the  Scopus  database.  Together,  they  contributed  3885  papers,  constituting 16.54 % share to the cumulative research  output  of  India  in  social  sciences  during  2008-12.  Table  1  shows  the  summary  of  the  data  for  the  25  Indian universities in social sciences, i.e., the number  of papers published (P), the citations obtained during  the  citation  window  (C),  the  average  number  of  citations  per  paper,  also  known  as  citation  impact  ( i  =  C /P   ),  the  Hirsch  h-index,  number  and  share  international  collaborative  papers  (ICP)  and  the  composite performance index (p). Table 2 provides  ranking  of  Indian  universities  in  social  sciences  by  various  schemes  or  indices.          
On  ranking  Indian  universities  by  research  output,  it  is  observed  from  Table  1  that,  University  
universities for the same period was determined from  
of  Delhi  tops  the  list  with  645  papers,  followed  by  the Scopus database. The number of papers which  
Jawaharlal  Nehru  University  (510  papers),  Anna  resulted  from  international  collaboration  could  also

Pondicherry  University,  which  secured  13th   rank  in  overall social sciences, had 8th  rank in psychology,  9th  rank in decision science, 11 
th 
 rank in economics,  econometrics  &  finance  and  16th rank  in  business,  management & accounting. Andhra University, which  secured 14th  rank in overall social sciences, had 8 
th rank in decision science, 10th  rank in psychology and  12th  rank in business, management & accounting. Guru  Nanak  Dev  University,  which  secured  15th   rank  in  overall social sciences, had 12th  rank both in decision  science  and  economics,  econometrics  &  finance  and 18th  rank in business, management & accounting.  
In this paper, a more rational procedure (using  composite performance index) has been presented  along with other procedures for ranking the research  performance of Indian universities in social sciences.  The ranking of 25 Indian universities in overall social  sciences, as well as in four sub-fields, namely economics,  econometrics  &  finance;  business,  management  &  accounting;  decision  science;  and  psychology  give  an  indicative  bibliometric  assessment  in  terms  of  few  parameters,  which  through  some  light  on  how  the social science higher education is performing as  generator of new knowledge. The leading performers  of  Indian  universities  in  social  sciences  and  in  its  sub-fields are also identified. Such universities can  be selected as a centre for advanced study for future  funding  by  research  agencies.  Such  an  exercise  will  also  create  competition  for  Indian  universities  for securing of future research grants from funding  agencies as well help in attracting bright new students  for postgraduate studies and Phd  research. Finally,  ranking  provides  an  opportunity  to  universities  to  improve their policies, including the funding structure,  research  infrastructure  and  environment,  quality,  etc.  It  concludes  that  ranking  based  on  composite  performance indicator as compared to other indicators  used here gives much better results as it combines  both  quantity  and  quality  aspects.
