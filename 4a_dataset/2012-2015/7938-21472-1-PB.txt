ABSTRACT 
The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  fnd  out  the  use  of  Govind  Ballabh  Pant  University  of Agriculture  &  Technology  (GBPUAT)  library  collection  and  services  by  postgraduate  students  and  research  scholars. The  scope  of  the  study  was  limited  to  the  use  of  library  collection  and  services  as  well  as  the  postgraduate  students  and  research  scholars.  Questionnaires  were  administered  randomly  among 250 students. A total 137 useable questionnaires were taken for analysis and interpretation.  The  Likert’s  scale  was  also  used  for  designing  questionnaire. The  fndings  showed  that  from  the  library’s  collection  (books/monographs,  reference  materials,  research  reports/bulletins,  CD-ROMs,  newsletters,  periodicals,  thesis/dissertations,  book  reviews  and  seminars/conference  proceedings/ workshops) whereas library services (photocopying, CD-ROM database, online, catalogue, indexing  and abstracting, CAS, bibliographical, reference, and lending/circulation) were the most used among  the  P.G.  students  and  research  scholars  for  different  purposes  like  (research  work,  project  work,  study, personal work). It was also observed that CD-ROM databases, e-journals and online databases  were the most highly used e-resources. Moreover, electronic and online databases such as AGRIS,  AGRICOLA, CAB Abstract and Agriculture & Natural Resources  were the most highly used databases  among the PG students and research scholars. The study puts forward its recommendations in regards  
to enhancing the use of collection and services.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The first five year plan in April 1951 was launched  for  improving  irrigation  facilities,  encouraging  the  use of fertilizers, improving varieties of seeds, and  implementing  machinery  and  institutional  credit.  It  happened  when  India  encountered  a  severe  food  shortage  and  was  confronted  with  mounting  inflation.  At  present,  agriculture  has  become  the  backbone of India’s economy for 70 % of the Indian  population.1 
After independence, India has observed green,  yellow, white, and golden revolution. The application  of  cutting  edge  science  and  technology,  positive  policies support, and hard work of farmers made all  this possible. India’s 1st   agriculture  university  (now  G.B.  Pant  University  of  Agriculture  &  Technology)  was established at Pantnagar 1960. At present, the  National  Agricultural  Research  System  has  about  30,000  scientists/teachers  in  47  Central  Institutes,  5  National  Bureaus,  12  Project  Directorates,  33  National Research Centers, 91 All India Coordinated  Research Projects, 440 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (i.e.,  Farm  Science  Centers),  120  Zonal  Agricultural  Research Stations, 10 Trainers Training Centres, 44  
Agriculture Technology Information Centres, numerous  regional  research  centres,  40  State  Agricultural  Universities,  5  Deemed  to  be  Universities  and  1  Central Agricultural University.2,3  The agricultural library  and  information  systems  (ALISs)  have  contributed  significantly  in  increasing  the  yield  level  of  crops,  and  alleviating  the  economic  status.  Currently,  the  application of information communication technologies  (ICTs)  in  agricultural  university  libraries  has  given  a  new  outlook  to  the  function,  services,  methods  and techniques used for collection, processing and  dissemination  of  information.4 
At present, a total of 46 agricultural universities  and  their  libraries  by  the  support  of  centre/state  government  in  different  parts  of  the  country  are  playing  a  vital  role  in  teaching,  learning,  research,  and extension.5,6  With their limited fund and resources,  the  libraries  have  to  develop  their  collections  and  to  satisfy  their  user’s  needs.  
During  1947-60,  the  very  slow  growth  of  agricultural  universities  was  noticed. The  historical  development  of  agricultural  u niversity  libraries  in  India  started  with  the  green  revolution,  a  dream  of  Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of

India. He laid the foundation of G.B. Pant University  of Agriculture and Technology (GBPUAT), Pantnagar,  on 17 November 19607. Since then, the library has  been  providing  quality  collection  and  services  to  the users’ community, supporting teaching, research  and  extension  programmes  of  the  university  by  adopting ICTs. The library has a highly specialised  collection of 3.9 Lakh8  information sources such as  books, theses, periodicals, standards, reprints, maps,  toposheets, globes, microfilms, microfiches, records,  tapes  &  CD-ROMs  in  the  field  of  agriculture  and  its  allied  areas. The  aim  of  the  present  study  is  to  examine  the  use  of  GBPUAT  library  collection  and  services  by  P.G.  students  and  research  scholars. 2. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
As this is the era of the technological revolution,  knowledge and information is growing in leaps and  bounds.  In  this  challenging  scenario,  the  libraries  have  to  meet  the  diverse  needs  of  the  users  by  developing good collections and effective services.  To  know  the  use  of  collection  and  services,  a  number of studies have been conducted.Therefore,  an extensive body of literature exists on the usage  
• of collection and services. Ocholla9 indicated the use  of  information  resources  in  the  following  order  of  frequencies:  journals,  textbooks,  research  reports,  • and conference literature. In another study, Shokeen10 revealed  that  periodicals  were  the  most  frequently  used  and  the  first  preferred  source  of  information  followed by books. A study by Singh11   showed  that  periodicals,  reference  books  and  textbooks  were  the  most  used  categories  of  documents.  Similarly,  
• Ogbomo  & Adomi12   found  that  all  the  respondents  consulted text books in the library. Periodicals were  
• the  most  widely  used  information  sources  by  the  research scholars and agricultural scientists.13,14 Singh  &  Satija15  showed  that  scientists  preferred  to  use  indexing  and  abstracting  periodicals,  and  primary  periodicals, while Majid, Anwar & eisenschitz16 found  that  research  scientists  preferred  using  primary  
with  all  reading  material  arrangements,  excluding  the  textbook.  In  their  study,  Shokeen  &  Kaushik10  found that browsing was the most preferred method  of  searching  for  required  information  applied  by  physiologists  and  sociologists.  Keshava,  Savanur  &  Kiran20  also  revealed  that  reprographic  service  quality, charges and the time taken was satisfactory  for  users. 
In  addition  of  adequacy  of  collection,  Singh  &  Singh13 stated that most research scholars found the  library collection as adequate, especially in e-form.  Ikhizama  &  Oduwole14   in  their  study  stated  that  most  of  the  agricultural  scientists  adjudged  library  collections as fair, while Khot & Patil19  indicated that  the library collections are not adequate to meet the  information  needs  of  research  scholars. 
3. OBJECTIVES  OF  THE  STUDY 
The  main  aim  of  this  study  was  to  find  out  the  use  of  GBPUAT  library  collection  and  services  by  P.G. students and research scholars. The objectives  of  the  present  study  are  to: 
Determine how frequently the students make use  
of  different  categories  of  information  sources  
and  services  in  the  library  
Know the purpose of usage of different categories  
of  information  sources  and  services  in  the  
library 
• Identify  the  type  of  e-resources  used  by  the  
students  in  the  library

review  articles.  
The study by Kannappanavar & Swamy17  showed  that  the  user’s  opinion  regarding  the  reference  collection was relevant for the study and many of the  users accessed the national/international databases.  Lohar & Kumbar18  showed that the library catalogue  for collecting information about the documents was  the  most  used  service  in  any  library.  It  was  also  revealed by Singh11 that the majority of users visited  the  library  to  update  their  professional  knowledge,  to  consult  documents  for  research  use  and  to  borrow/return documents. Circulation, photocopy, and  reference  were  the  most  helpful  and  very  popular  services.  Khot  &  Patil19 indicated  that  the  opinions  of  the  majority  of  the  research  scholars  regarding  reference and circulation services were satisfactory and  a  large  number  of  researcher  were  satisfied

METHODOLOGY  
The  total  registered  population  of  students  at  GBPUAT  library  is  24427.  Since  the  registered  population size was large, random sampling technique  was applied and 250 (10.25 %) registered students of  GBPUAT library as accessible or sample population  were  selected.  A  questionnaire  was  administered  among 250 students of GBPUAT. A total 143 (57.2 %)  questionnaires were returned. Finally, 137 (54.8 %)  useable questionnaires were selected. For analysing  and presenting the collected data, the techniques and  tools such as Likert’s scale, frequency distribution,  percentage, mean scores & ranking, MS-Word, and  MS-excel  were  used  for  calculations. 
5. ANALYSIS AND  FINDINGS 
Out  of  137  respondents,  90  (65.69  %)  were  P.G.  students  and  47  (34.31  %)  were  research

scholars.  The  collected  data  was  analysed  and  finding  were  drawn. 
5.1  Use  of  Collection  and  Services 
In  the  library,  users  use  different  types  of  collection  and  services  for  their  information  needs.  The whole library collection and services has been  categorised  into  various  information  sources  and  services.  
The mean use ranking of these information sources  showed that books/monographs, reference materials,  research  reports/bulletins,  CD-ROMs,  newsletters,  periodicals,  thesis/dissertations,  book  reviews  and  seminars/conference  proceedings/workshops  were  the  most  used  sources  of  information  among  the  majority  of  P.G.  students  and  research  scholars.  It  was  also  observed  that  microfiches/records/tapes,  standards/patents/specifications and reprints/maps/ globes  are  very  less  used  among  P.G.  students  
of  library  collection  and  services  under  study,  the  respondents  were  asked  to  state  any  one  or  more  than  one,  out  of  five  purposes  listed  as  research  work purpose, project work purpose, study, personal  work  purpose,  and  no  response. 
As  stated  in  the  Table  1,  majority  of  the  P.G.  students and research scholars revealed that books/ monographs, theses/dissertations, seminars/conference/ workshops  proceedings,  research  reports/bulletins,  and  periodicals  were  the  most  used  sources  for  the  different  purposes  which  were  research  work,  project work, study, and personal work. Newsletters,  reprints/maps/globes, reference materials, CD-ROMs,  and  microfiches/records/tapes  were  also  used  by  the  majority  of  the  research  scholars.  Information  sources such as microfiches/records/tapes, standards/ patents/specifications,  book  reviews,  newsletters,  CD-ROMs, reference materials, and reprints/maps/ 
globes  were  not  much  used  by  the  students  while  and  research  scholars  of  the  university.  These  
book  reviews  and  standards/patents/specifications  
observations  were  seen  from  Table  1. 
It was also noticed from Table 2 that the maximum  percentage of P.G. students and research scholars  used photocopy, catalogue, lending/circulation, CD- ROM  database,  CAS,  reference,  and  indexing  &  abstracting  (I&A)  services,  respectively.  Online  
were  least  used  by  them. 
It  was  observed  from  the  mean  score  and  ranking  of  Table  2  that  lending/circulation,  online,  CD-ROM  database,  photocopy,  CAS,  catalogue,  I&A,  bibliographical,  and  reference  were  the  most  
been  used  by  the  students  but  services  like  inter- library loan (ILL), microfilm, and document delivery  service (DDS) are used less compared to the other  services. 
5.2  Purpose  of  Use  of  Collection  and  Services 
To determine the purpose of using different types  
and  bibliographical  services  are  also  frequently  
used  library  services  by  the  students,  whereas  
bibliographical,  CD-ROM  database,  online,  I&A,  
photocopy, catalogue, lending/circulation, and reference  were  among  the  most  used  by  the  majority  of  research  scholars  for  their  different  purposes.  In  addition,  DDS,  ILL,  and  microfilm  were  also  very  less used library services among the P.G. students  and  research  scholars.

5.3  Satisfaction  Level  in  Using  Collection  and  
Services  
The  aim  is  to  analyse  the  viewpoint  of  P.G.  students and research scholars on satisfaction level  related  to  the  use  of  collection  and  services. 
It  was  found  from  Table  1  that  most  of  the  P.G.  students  were  highly  satisfied  with  reference  materials, books/monographs, research reports/bulletins,  newsletters,  thesis/dissertations,  periodicals,  CD- ROMs, seminars/conference proceedings/workshops  and  book  reviews.  Similarly,  most  of  the  research  scholars  were  satisfied  with  CD-ROMs,  thesis/ dissertations, books/monographs, newsletters, book  reviews,  reference  materials,  research  reports/ bulletins, seminars/conference proceedings/workshops,  and periodicals respectively. The P.G. students and  research  scholars  were  very  less  satisfied  with  microfiches/records/tapes, reprints/maps/globes, and  standards/patents/specifications  due  to  uneasy  or  direct  access  to  them.  According  to  mean  score  and  ranking  from  Table  2,  P.G.  students  were  highly satisfied with photocopy, CD-ROM database,  online, catalogue, I&A, and CAS respectively. In the  same  way,  research  scholars  were  highly  satisfied  with  the  services  such  as  the  CD-ROM  database,  photocopy, catalogue, online, I&A, and CAS. Moreover,  P.G.  students  and  research  scholars  were  also  satisfied with bibliographical, reference, and lending/ circulation  services.  It  was  also  revealed  that  P.G.  students  and  research  scholars  were  not  satisfied  
5.4  Use  of  E-resources 
Table 3 shows the mean use score and ranking  and  indicates  that  CD-ROM  databases,  e-journals,  and  online  databases  were  the  most  highly  used  e-resources  among  most  of  the  P.G.  students  and  research  scholars.  It  was  also  observed  that  the  e-format  of  dictionaries,  encyclopedias,  and  books  were  the  very  less  used  due  to  lack  of  skills/ instructions,  and  poor  number  of  computers  (poor  facility).  
Companies  around  the  world  are  publishing  scientific  data  electronically  in  the  field  of  agro- biological  sciences.  Some  international  prominent  electronic  and  online  databases  as  mentioned  above  for  searching  the  latest  research  literature  on  agriculture  were  subscribed  by  the  library. 
According  to  mean  use  frequency  score  and  ranking  of  electronic  and  online   databases  from  the  Table  4,  AGRIS,  AGRICOLA,  CAB  Abstract  and   Agriculture  &  Natural  Resources   were  the  most used databases among the P.G. students and  research  scholars.  However,  BIOSIS  with  a  mean  of  1.23  was  also  one  of  the  most  used  databases  by  the  students. 
It is also observed that e-resources are becoming  an important part of an agricultural university library  in  fulfilling  the  demands  of  users  for  their  required  information. 
5.5  Evaluation  of  the  Library  Collection 
It was observed from Table 5 that P.G. students  
with  microfilm,  DDS,  and  ILL  services  because  of  
and research scholars opined that the print collection  their  time  consuming  nature,  lack  of  direct  access,  
was more adequate than electronic. Thus, the result  
and  discouraging  nature  of  library  staff.

terms  of  adequacy  of  the  library  collection.  It  has  also been observed that print collection was playing  a  vital  role  in  fulfilling  the  demands  of  the  student  community  in  the  library. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
The  study  reveals  that  the  library  collection,  such  as  books/monographs,  reference  materials,  research  reports/bulletins,  CD-ROMs,  newsletters,  periodicals,  thesis/dissertations,  book  reviews  and  seminars/conference  proceedings/workshops  were  the  most  used  sources  of  information  among  the  P.G. students and research scholars to satisfy their  different purposes. Moreover, the library services as  photocopy,  CD-ROM  database,  online,  catalogue,  indexing  and  abstracting,  CAS,  bibliographical,  reference, and lending/circulation are most frequently  used services by the students. It was observed that  CD-ROM databases, e-journals, and online databases  were  most  used  e-resources  among  the  students.  Electronic  and  online  databases  such  as  AGRIS,  AGRICOLA, CAB Abstract and Agriculture & Natural  Resources   were  the  most  used  databases  among  the  P.G.  students  and  research  scholars.  Finally,  it  was also observed that the collection and services  in  e-format  have  become  the  most  used  medium  and  an  important  part  of  the  agricultural  university  library in fulfilling the demands of the user community  for  required  information.  In  this  regard,  the  library  is  playing  an  important  role  in  transferring  the  scientific and technological information to the users  by stocking a good amount of print and e-collection  in  agriculture  and  other  related  subjects. 
It has brought to light some of the inadequacies  and  drawbacks  on  the  use  of  collection  and  services  of  the  library  and  helped  to  identify  areas  which  need  improvement.  Some  of  the  recommendations suggested are mentioned below: • Number of copies of most utilised books should  be  increased  so  that  more  users  can  use  them  at  the  same  time. 
• The  library  should  develop  a  better  network  
with  all  the  famous  national  and  international

agricultural  organisations/libraries  to  use  their  resources  and  services. 
Due to the information and technological revolution,  the  library  needs  to  subscribe  to  more  number  of e-resources and should also purchase more  number  of  networked  computers  on  which  the  searching and browsing for needed information  could  be  done  effectively. 
The  library  should  strengthen  and  accelerate  their  awareness  campaigns  concerning  the  use  of  print  and  electronic  information  sources  through  the  latest  promotion  methods  such  as  e-mail  alert/pop  up  system,  text  messages,  workshops,  prizes,  etc. 
The  library  services  must  be  user  focused  and  enhanced. 
Librarian and library staff need to improve their  knowledge and skills by attending more training  program on effective searching and retrieval in  order  to  train  its  users  more  effectively;  and  for  optimum  utilisation  of  available  information  sources. 
The library must provide orientation assistance  to the  users and one compulsory user education  or  information  literacy  program 
Latest  or  revised  editions/volumes/issues     should be acquired more frequently for optimum  utilisation.
