The  Open Access  Movement  (OAM),  which  started  as  a  gradual  realisation  by  authors  mainly  in  biomedical sciences to make available results of public-funded research projects to the public without much  barrier pertaining to cost, permission, copyright obligations, etc., gradually gained momentum across the  world and India was no exception to it. Though the movement was confned mainly to science, technology  and medical felds in India, since last few years, a number of open access repositories and open access  journals in Social Science subjects have started appearing. The present study which is confned to the  open access Social Science journals published from India as mentioned in the Directory of Open Access  Journals,  identifed  60  open  access  Social  Sciences  journals  in  India. The  study  also  analysed  the  journals on the basis of certain parameters as to trend of open access journals in Social Sciences, and  was found that most of open access journals in Social Sciences appeared between 2009 and 2014 and  about half of the journals charge authors for publishing their papers in the journals and only a few are  published under Creative Commons Attribution. Lastly, the paper discusses about implications of open  access publishing on Social Science research libraries made few suggestions towards encouraging open  
access publishing in Social Science subjects in India.

1.    IntrOductIOn  
The  Open  Access  Movement  (OAM),  which  started in the developed countries as a movement in  recognition to the need that the output of public-funded  research should be made available to public at large  without any barrier pertaining to cost, access, etc.,  dates back to 19911. The movement gained further  momentum  with  three  landmark  ‘initiatives’,  viz.,  the  Budapest  Open  Access  Initiative  (2001),  the  Bethesda  Statement  on  Open  Access  Publishing  (April  2003),  and  the  Berlin  Declaration  on  Open  Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities   (October  2003).  An  analysis  of  the  definitions  put  forth in three initiatives reveal the following criteria  which are to be satisfied for a piece of literature to  be  qualified  as  an  open  access  (OA)  literature2 (a) The OA literature is freely available: Notwithstanding  
the differences about the other aspects of essential  
characteristics  of  open  access  literature,  free  
availability  is  the  ‘the  element  that  catalysed  
the  open-access  movement’3.  As  such,  free  
availability  is  the  first  and  foremost  of  the  
characteristics  of  open  access  literature; (b) The  OA  literature  is  online:  The  cost  factor  
makes  it  almost  mandatory  for  OA  literature  to  
be  online  as  the  cost  of  digital  publication  of  
literature and their distribution through intranet,  
Received 25 March 2015, revised 9 April 2015, online published 22 April 2015 
internet,  etc.,  is  minimal  compared  to  print  
versions; 
(c) The OA literature publication requires processing  
fee:  Though  in  an  ideal  situation,  authors  are  
not  required  to  pay  for  publishing  their  works  
in  open  access  domain,  many  open  access  
journals  charge  authors  either  at  the  time  of  
submission or at the time of acceptance in the  
form  of  ‘processing  fees’; 
(d) The  OA  literature  can  be  used  with  minimal  
restrictions:  In  addition  to  be  made  available  
as  free  literature,  open  access  literature  can  
also  be  used  with  minimal  restrictions  as  long  
as  there  is  correct  attribution  and  the  integrity  
of  the  work  is  maintained. 
1.1    Open  Access  Movements  in  India  
The  establishment  of  first  interoperable  and  OA  institutional  repository  in  the  Indian  Institute  of  Science,  in  September  20024   is  a  landmark  event  and  it  was  followed  by  several  other  institutional  repositories  (IRs)  like  the  Vidyanidhi   (University  of  Mysore),  and  Librarian’s  Digital  Library  (DRTC,  Bangalore). Afterwards, a large number of IRs were  set  up  in  India. As  per  a  recent  studys,  there  are  68  IRs  in  India  which  is  quite  significant  and  India  stands  second  only  to  Brazil  among  the  BRICS

countries  in  terms  of  number  of  IRs.  Similarly,  overall,  there  are  4,91,622  records  are  uploaded  in  the  IRs6.  So  far  as  OA  journals  are  concerned,  the  OA  journals  publishing  also  started  in  early  part of the last decade. The advocacy programmes

conducted by NCSI, IISc, Indian Medlars, MedKnow,  etc., towards OA publishing may be one basic reason  
towards successful venture of OA in India7. As per a  registry updated till April 11, 2013, there are 563 OA  journals in India 
8 
  which  is  quite  impressive  among  the  developing  countries  of  the  world.  So  far,  as  mandate towards OA publishing is concerned, several  institutions  in  India  such  as  INSA  (a  signatory  to  Berlin declaration), NIIT, Rourkela, ICRISAT, Hyderabad  had  earlier  made  it  mandatory  to  submit  different  versions of research papers in the respective IR. The  report  of  the  National  Knowledge  Commission  has  recommended that ‘Peer-reviewed research papers  resulting  from  publicly-funded  research  should  be  made  available  through  OA  channels,  subject  to  copyright  regulations9.  The  movement  culminated  with  the  issuance  of  the  OA  policy  by  Department  of  Science  and  Technology  and  Department  of  Biotechnology  in  December  2014  which  not  only  mandated submission of final versions of the research  papers  coming  out  of  research  grants  received  from DBT and DST in the respective institutions (in  centrally managed repositories by DBT and DST in  case  the  host  institution  does  have  an  IR)  where  the  researchers  are  working,  but  also  strongly  recommended  that  every  institutions  that  receive  funds  from  DBT  and  DST  have  an  IR10. 
1.2    Open  Access  Movement  and  Social      
  Sciences 
Social  science  research  in  India  dates  back  to  establishment of Indian Universities in the later part  of the nineteenth century. Various universities in India  started  offering  courses  in  several  social  science  disciplines  such  as  Economics,  Political  Science,  Sociology,  History,  etc.,  which  led  to  proliferation  of  research  in  the  subject.  The  establishment  of  several research centres such as Gokhale Institute  of  Politics  and  Economics,  Tata  Institute  of  Social  Sciences,  etc.,  also  added  to  the  acceleration  of  social  science  research  in  India.  Further,  the  establishment  of  the  Indian  Council  for  Social

and  Economics,  Pune;  (vi)  Indira  Gandhi  Institute  of  Development  Research,  Mumbai  besides  other  27 research institutions funded by the ICSSR. Table  1 reproduced from a report gives a clear picture of  distribution  of  social  science  institutions  in  India.  Hence,  it  is  evident  that  research  in  the  subject  is  scattered between university departments, deemed  universities and specialised research institutions. Even  though  India  has  the  highest  volume  of  research  output  in  entire  South Asia,  there  is  wide  disparity  in  research  activity  and  output  across  the  country  both  in  terms  of  quantity  and  quality.  Some  of  the  premium  universities  located  mostly  in  major  cities  foster  academic  research  cultures  which  include  interdisciplinary  work,  knowledge  production  with  emphasis  on  peer  review,  and  engagement  with  internal and external learned societies. On the other  hand,  the  quality  of  research  in  a  large  majority  of  institutions  neither  conforms  to  international  academic  standards  nor  have  they  been  able  to  make  a  significant  contribution  to  social  science  research,  either  theoretical  or  applied  and  policy- oriented,  in  the  country11,12. 
The present study is an overview of open access  movement pertaining to Social Sciences in India. As  there  are  only  a  handful  of  research  institutions  in  Social Sciences which have institutional repositories  are there and also it is not clear about whether the  OA  repository  is  subject  specific  or  not,  the  study  includes basically the OA journals in social sciences  and  allied  subjects  published  from  India.  
Though  India’s  show  in  the  international  arena  is noteworthy so far as OA publishing is concerned,  but  mostly  that  has  been  confined  to  the  science  and  medical  science  fields.  The  number  of  IRs  devoted  to  Social  Science  subjects  is  negligible  as most the repositories were established either in  
Science  Research  in  1969  gave  a  big  impetus  to  scientific research institutions or in Indian Institutes  
the research activities in social sciences. Presently,  there  are  more  than  200  government  research  institutes  and  autonomous  organisations  which  undertake  social  science  research.  Some  of  the  major social science research centres in India are:  (i)  Tata  Institute  of  Social  Sciences,  Mumbai;  (ii)  Visva  Bharati,  Shantiniketan;  (iii)  Delhi  School  of  Economics  (Delhi  University),  Delhi;  (iv)  Different  social  science  departments  of  Jawaharlal  Nehru  University,  Delhi;  (v)  Gokhale  Institute  of  Politics  
178 
of Technology which understandably is predominantly  oriented towards engineering and technology. However,  providing barrier-free access to some social science  literature  like  working  papers,  discussion  papers,  reports,  etc.,  which  are  important  from  research  perspective  of  social  science  subjects  started  much  earlier.  For  example,  some  of  the  prominent  research institutions like the Indira Gandhi Institute of  Development Research, Gokhale Institute of Politics  and Economics, National Institute of Public Finance

RATH: STUDy  OF OPEN ACCESS PUBLISHING IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR LIBRARIES 
and  Policy,  etc.,  have  been  providing  free  access  to their working papers since early parts of the last  decade.  Similarly,  the  number  of  OA  journals  was  very  few  in  social  science  subjects  compared  to  Science and Technology. A study conducted in 2011  identified  only  25  open  access  journals  in  social  sciences in India (including) subjects such as Law,  Library  and  Information  Science,  Management  and  interdisciplinary7. Recently, however, the trend seems  to  be  changing  and  there  has  been  a  significant  growth  in  OA  journals  in  social  science  subjects  in  India.  So  far  as  open  IRs  are  concerned,  apart  from  the  Universities,  only  a  few  social  science  research  institutions  such  as  the  Gokhale  Institute  of  Politics  and  Economics,  Indira  Gandhi  Institute  of  Development  Research  and  Institute  of  Social  and  Economic  Change,  V.V.  Giri  National  Labour  Institute, Tata Institute of Social Sciences etc., have  their  own  IRs.  Besides,  some  Indian  Institutes  of  Management  (IIMs)  such  as  IIM-Ahmedabad,  IIM- Kozhikode,  etc.  have  also  developed  their  IRs. 1.3    Open Access  Strategies 
Open  access  can  be  accomplished  through  two  complementary  strategies,  viz.,  self-archiving  and  OA  journals.  In  the  earlier  strategy,  authors  typically  upload  an  e-print  (either  pre-print  or  post  print  depending  upon  the  policy  of  the  publisher  where  their  work  is  published)  in  an  IRs  which  is  typically  referred  to  as  the  ‘Green  Road’  to  open  access,  and  in  the  second  strategy,  authors  can  publish their articles in open access journals normally  called  as  ‘Gold  Road’  to  open  access. 
2.    Object IveS 
The  objective  of  the  study  are  to: 
(a)  Find  out  the  growth  of  OA  journals  in  social  
sciences  published  from  India.  
(b)  Find  out  their  policy  pertaining  to  acceptance  
of papers for publication, the factors that might  
have  caused  the  increase  of  OA  journals  in  
India  and  the  major  publishers  of  open  access  
journals  in  social  sciences  in  India.  
3.   MethOdOLOGy 
The present study is carried out on social science  journals published from India that are available open  access. The list is taken from the Directory of Open  Access Journals (DOAJ). Apart from taking journals  devoted  to  traditional  social  science  subjects  like  Anthropology,  Sociology,  Economics,  etc.,  journals  on  Management,  Library  and  Information  Science,  Linguistics which have significant bearing on social  sciences  are  also  considered.  That  apart,  some  interdisciplinary  subjects  are  considered  for  the  purpose  of  the  study. 
The  paper  did  not  attempt  to  study  the  impact  factor of the journals after it is found that most the  OA journals have started appearing during last very  few years and it is premature to assess the quality  of  the  journals  based  upon  the  impact  factor. 
4.   AnALySIS And  FIndInGS 
The  study  finds  that  the  starting  from  1999,  a  number of OA journals started appearing in the field  of  social  sciences.  Table  2  and  Fig.  1  shows  the  growth  of  OA  journals  in  social  science  in  India.  The Table and Fig. did not consider two established  open  access  journals  such  as  Annals  of  Library  and  Information  Studies  and  DESIDOC  Journal  of  Library  &  Information  Technology   because  though  the  full-text  of  the  same  journals  is  available  since  their respective first issues, it was not clear exactly  the year when these two journals started publishing  open  access. 
From Table  2,  it  is  evidently  clear  that  most  of  the OA journals in social sciences started appearing  during  last  five  years.  In  fact,  out  of  60  journal  titles that were considered for the study, 45 journals  75  %  started  appearing  during  2009-2014.  The  year  2011  alone  witnessed  appearance  of  12  OA  journals  in  social  science  subjects,  followed  by  10  in  2012.  Perhaps  it  may  be  the  result  of  the  policy  of the University Grants Commission (UGC) to link  research  output  in  the  form  of  journal  articles  with  recruitment  and  promotion  which  got  reflected  in  proliferation  of  articles  in  social  science  subjects.  So  far,  as  publication  policy  is  concerned  though  most  of  the  journals  claim  to  have  followed  the  peer-reviewing process before acceptance of articles  for publication, 30 journals which is half of the total  number of journals considered, charge publication/

processing  fee  either  at  the  time  of  submission,  or  acceptance  of  papers,  or  both.  The  study  also  reveals  that  barring  a  few  established  journals,  other  journals  don’t  have  any  print  version  of  the  journal. 
While  it  has  been  gradually  becoming  a  policy  in  the  western  countries  to  publish  OA  journals  under the Creative Commons Attribution (specifically  CC-By),  which  allows  the  content  to  be  copied,  distributed,  edited,  re-mixed  and  built  upon,  even  commercially,  within  the  boundaries  of  copyright  law,  as  long  as  there  is  attribution  to  the  original  creation, only 15 out of the 60 journals are published  under  the  Creative  Commons  Attribution.    5.   rOLe OF   L IbrArIeS 
The libraries in social science research institutes  in India are gradually opening up to adoption of new  technologies and in fact, most of the social science  research  libraries  resort  to  different  technological  tools  and  internet  for  providing  better  services  to  their respective clientele. Traditionally, the outcome of  research in social sciences comes in different formats  such  as  journal  articles,  books,  working  papers,  monographs, etc., and the libraries attached to social  science research institutes have to procure the same  to  serve  their  users  in  a  better  way.  However,  the  OA  has  opened  up  a  huge  potential  for  libraries  to  procure  a  potentially  large  number  of  journals  with  a  much  lesser  investment  and  add  them  in  their  main  collection.  Even,  with  the  use  of  federated  search  mechanism,  it  is  also  possible  for  libraries  to  provide  access  to  the  OA  materials  through  the  OPAC.  Simultaneously,  however,  libraries  need  to  be very careful in selecting the quality OA journals  in  social  sciences.  As  is  evident  from  the  study,  most  of  the  OA  journals  in  India  started  appearing  during  last  five  years  after  a  policy  promulgation  by UGC, hence it is but natural that many journals  might  have  mushroomed  to  accommodate  articles  from  budding  researchers  and  teachers  without  bothering much about the quality. Here, the libraries  can  play  a  pivotal  role  in  identifying  the  quality  journals.  In  fact,  it  is  also  possible  to  prepare  a  list  of  so  called  ‘predatory  journals’  as  has  been  
180 
done  by  Jeffrey  Bell13.  Libraries  can  also  play  a  crucial  role  in  identifying  the  core  OA  journals  in  social  science  subjects  in  India  and  assist  the  researchers  to  submit  their  research  papers  in  the  same  journals.  Finally,  the  libraries  can  also  create  IRs  to  store  and  disseminate  OA  literature  from  the  same.  
6.     cOncLuSIOnS 
  Open  access  publishing,  which  is  becoming  a  trend in social sciences in India in recent years, is  definitely a welcome development as the OA journals  are  likely  to  increase  the  visibility  of  research  papers  by  Indian  scholars.  It  is  true  that  earlier,  some  OA  portals  such  as  RepEc,  SSRN,  e-Social  Sciences,  etc.,  used  to  provide  access  to  mainly  e-resources to different social science subjects and  most  of  the  social  science  research  institutes  has  been  providing  free  access  to  their  grey  literature  such as working papers, discussion papers, annual  reports,  etc.,  access  to  peer  reviewed  journals  articles  has  been  a  difficulty  for  researchers  in  social  sciences. Also,  the  Indian  publications  often  used  to  get  unnoticed  at  the  international  level  which  is  evident  from  the  fact  the  percentage  of  Indian  contributions  in  Economics  &  Business  was  between  2004  and  2008  was  only  0.72  %  with  a  relative impact of 59 % whereas the same for social  sciences  was  0.67  %  with  relative  impact  of  39  %  when  compared  to  the  overall  contribution  and  impact factor of the country14. It is true that the fund  allocation  for  various  research  and  development  activities  in  social  sciences  in  India  is  meagre  compared  to  science  and  technology.  There  are  still  many  projects  especially  on  subject  fields  like  Economics,  Demography,  Sociology,  Anthropology  which attract large amount of public funding and the  results  of  which  often  get  reported  in  international  peer  reviewed  journals  and  researchers  in  India  face difficulty in getting access to the said literature.  Hence, in the line of OA policy approved for all DST  and  DBT  and  ICAR-funded  projects,  there  should  be  a  similar  policy  for  social  science  literature  in  India.  The  major  recommendations  should  be  as  follows: 
(a) Research papers emanated out of public funded  
research  in  social  science  subjects  in  India  
should  be  made  available  to  public  at  large  
without  any  barrier  such  as  cost,  permission,  
copyright,  etc. 
(b) All the research institutes in social sciences funded  
by ICSSR should be encouraged and funded to  
create  their  own  institutional  repositories  that  
will  house  pre-print  and  post-print  of  research  
publications  in  the  form  of  journal  articles,  
popular articles, success stories, case studies,  
annual reports, project reports, schedules, grey

literature such as working papers and discussion  
papers,  in-house  seminar  papers,  and  other  
such  material  which  are  useful  from  research  
point  of  view. 
(c) It  should  be  mandatory  for  the  research  paper  
to  deposit  a  post-print  copy  of  their  research  
publications  that  is  result  of  a  public  funded  
project, in the respective institutional repository  
where  the  researcher  is  working. 
(d) The  authors  of  scholarly  literature  produced  
from  the  research  funded  wholly  or  partly  by  
the ICSSR, ICHR, UGC and similar other bodies  
are  advised  to  mention  about  the  OA  policy  
pertaining to public-funded social science research  
while signing the copyright agreements with the  
publishers. 
(e) A central IR should be established at the ICSSR  
where a copy of all the project reports and post- 
prints  of  research  papers  should  be  deposited  
and  made  available  to  researchers. 
(f) As part of monitoring OA journals, a central advisory  
and quality control cell should be established to  
assess the quality of open access social science  
journals in India and encourage the scholars to  
submit the research papers in selected Indian OA  
journals which will go a long way in increasing  
the  visibility  of  Indian  publications  worldwide.
