 The study analyses the Indian publications output in glaucoma research during 2002-11 on different  parameters  including  contribution  &  citation  impact  of  top  most  productive  countries,  India’s  overall  contribution,  its  growth  pattern  and  citation  impact,  the  share  of  international  collaboration  in  India’s  overall research output, contribution of leading countries and identifcation of leading foreign collaborating  partners, Indian contribution & impact of different types of glaucoma, glaucoma research by sub-felds and  glaucoma research output by different population age groups, productivity and impact of leading Indian  institutions and authors and pattern of communication of Indian output in most productive journals. The  Scopus  citation  database  has  been  used  to  retrieve  the  data  for  10  years  (2002-11)  by  searching  the  keywords ‘glaucoma or intraocular pressure’ in combined Title, Abstract and Keywords feld. The Indian  publications  output  in  glaucoma  research  (1078  papers)  during  2002-11  increased  from  61  papers  in  2002 to 207 papers in 2011, witnessing an annual average growth rate of 18.29 %. The average citation  impact per paper registered by Indian publications in glaucoma research was 3.03 during 2002-11, which  decreased  from  3.87  during  2002-06  to  2.49  during  2007-11. The  international  collaborative  share  of  India in overall glaucoma research was 21.06 % during 2002-11, which increased from 17.92 % during  2002-06 to 23.09 % during 2007-11. The glaucoma’s irreversibility, lacking of glaucoma specialists and  patients unawareness demand for an economic and effective glaucoma diagnosis system for screening.  Disease  control  and  elimination  require  an  adequately  trained  functional  workforce  with  an  enabling  infrastructure and technology. The authors suggest that research efforts needs to be strengthened quiet  substantially  by  way  of  investment  in  R&D.  Both  research  output  and  quality  of  research  should  be  increased  and  strengthened  and  international  collaborative  research  may  further  be  widened  to  learn  
from the experiences of other countries.

1. IntROductIOn 
The term ‘glaucoma’ covers a number of different  eye  conditions,  all  of  which  involve  damage  to  the  optic  nerve.  This  damage  leads  to  the  field  of  vision having ever larger gaps, which mostly remain  unnoticed  at  first.  Your  field  of  vision  is  the  range  of  what  you  can  see  when  your  eyes  are  looking  straight  ahead.  In  advanced  stages,  your  ability  to  see  things  sharply  (visual  acuity)  also  gets  worse.  One  common  cause  is  that  there  is  too  much  pressure  inside  the  eye.  This  pressure  is  called  intraocular pressure. Intraocular pressure is caused  by  a  fluid  in  the  chambers  of  the  eye  between  the  cornea  and  the  lens.  This  fluid  is  called  aqueous  humor  and  is  produced  by  the  eye  itself.  It  flows  continuously  from  the  back  (posterior)  chamber  
to  the  front  (anterior)  chamber  and  then  back  out  through  a  very  thin  tube  (Schlemm’s  canal).  This  cycle helps to maintain constant pressure in a healthy  eye. The aqueous humor also provides nutrients to  the  cornea,  the  iris,  and  the  lens.  If  the  aqueous  humor is prevented from draining properly, it starts  to  collect  and  pressure  within  the  eye  builds  up.  This  presses  against  the  optic  nerve  and  there  is  a  risk  that  nerve  cells  die.  Whether  the  increased  intraocular  pressure  does  cause  damage  depends  on,  among  other  things,  how  well  the  optic  nerve  can  resist  this  pressure:  only  some  people  with  high  intraocular  pressure  have  an  optic  nerve  that  is  susceptible  to  damage.  Intraocular  pressure  is  measured  in  mm  Hg  (millimeters  of  mercury),  the  same  unit  used  for  blood  pressure.  Readings

between 10 and 21 mm Hg are considered normal.  Someone who has glaucoma does not always have  above-average  intraocular  pressure1.  
2.   t yPe Of  GlAucOmA 
(i)  Open-angle  glaucoma  (also  called  primary  or  
chronic glaucoma) is caused by the slow clogging  
of  the  drainage  canals,  resulting  in  increased  
eye  pressure  It  has  a  wide  and  open  angle  
between the iris and cornea. It develops slowly  
and  is  a  lifelong  condition.  It  is  most  common  
form of glaucoma, accounting for at least 90 %  
of  all  glaucoma;  
(ii)  Angle-closure  glaucoma,  caused  by  blocked  
drainage  canals,  resulting  in  a  sudden  rise  
in  intraocular  pressure.  It  is  a  result  of  the  
angle  between  the  iris  and  cornea  closing.  
It  is  comparatively  a  less  common  form  of  
glaucoma;  
(iii) Normal-tension  glaucoma  (also  called  low- 
tension or normal-pressure glaucoma) leads to  
the  damage  of  optic  nerve,  even  though  the  
eye  pressure  may  not  very  high;  and  (iv) Congenital  glaucoma  (also  called  childhood  
glaucoma and for glaucoma diagnosed in infancy  
or early childhood), caused by abnormal intraocular  
fluid  drainage  from  the  eye  as  a  result  of  a  
blocked  or  defective  trabecular  meshwork.  It  
may be due to an hereditary defect or abnormal  
development during pregnancy. In other cases,  
an abnormal drainage system may be the result  
of some other disease in the eye which results  
in  secondary  glaucoma2.  
Most other types of glaucoma are variations of  open-angle  or  angle-closure  types:  
(a)  Secondary  Glaucoma 
(d)  Traumatic  Glaucoma 
Injury  to  the  eye  immediately  or  years  later  may  cause  traumatic  glaucoma.  It  can  be  caused  by  blunt  injuries  that  bruise  the  eye  (called  blunt  trauma)  or  by  injuries  that  penetrate  the  eye;  (e) Neovascular  Glaucoma 
The  abnormal  formation  of  new  blood  vessels  on  the  iris  and  over  the  eye's  drainage  channels  can  cause  asuch  a  glaucoma.  The  new  blood  vessels  block  the  eye's  fluid  from  exiting  through  the trabecular meshwork (the eye's drainage canals),  causing  an  increase  in  eye  pressure  It  is  always  associated  with  other  abnormalities,  most  often  diabetes.  It  never  occurs  on  its  own;  
(f) Irido  Corneal  Endothelial  Syndrome  (ICE) 
Cells on the back surface of the cornea spread  over  the  eye's  drainage  tissue  and  across  the  surface  of  the  iris,  increasing  eye  pressure  and  damaging the optic nerve. These corneal cells also  form  adhesions  that  bind  the  iris  to  the  cornea,  further  blocking  the  drainage  channels3.  
Glaucoma  affects  about  70  million  people  worldwide, of whom about 10 per cent are believed  to  be  bilaterally  blind.  It  is  estimated  that  by  the  year  2020,  this  number  would  rise  to  around  79.6  million.  Statistics  gathered  by  the  World  Health  Organisation (WHO) show that glaucoma is the second  leading  cause  of  blindness  globally,  after  cataract.  Glaucoma, however, presents greater health challenge  than  cataract  because  the  blindness  it  causes  is  irreversible.    India  has  the  third  largest  number  of  glaucoma  patients,  after  China  and  Europe/uSA.  Glaucoma  is  the  third  leading  cause  of  blindness  in  India,  but  the  alarming  thing  is  that  by  the  time  a patient is detected to be having glaucoma, 90 %  
by  certain  drugs  such  as  steroids;  
(b) Pigmentary  Glaucoma 
It  occurs  when  the  pigment  granules  that  are  in  the  back  of  the  iris  (the  colored  part  of  the  eye)  break  into  the  clear  fluid  produced  inside  the  eye.  These  tiny  pigment  granules  flow  toward  the  drainage  canals  in  the  eye  and  slowly  clog  them.  This  causes  eye  pressure  to  rise;  
(c)  Pseudoexfoliative  Glaucoma 
It  occurs  when  a  flaky,  dandruff-like  material  peels  off  the  outer  layer  of  the  lens  within  the  eye. The material collects in the angle between the  cornea  and  iris  and  can  clog  the  drainage  system  of  the  eye,  causing  eye  pressure  to  rise;  
Here  disease  contributes  to  increased  eye  
have lost 50 % of their sight In India, it is estimated  pressure,  resulting  in  optic  nerve  damage  and  
that glaucoma affects 12 million people accounting  vision  loss  or  may  occur  as  the  result  of  an  eye  
for 12.8 % of the countries blindness and by 2020;  injury,  inflammation,  tumor,  or  in  advanced  cases  
this is expected to be 16 million. Population-based  of  cataract  or  diabetes  or  it  can  also  be  caused  
studies  report  a  prevalence  between  2  to  13  %  
in  India.  In  India,  more  than  90  %  of  glaucoma  
36 
in  the  community  is  undiagnosed.  Statistics  say  one  in  eight  persons  above  the  age  of  40  years  in  India  is  either  suffering  from  glaucoma  or  is  at  risk  of  the  disease.  Glaucoma  can  affect  any  age  group,  including  newborn,  infants,  children,  and  elderly4-6.  
3.   lI teRAtuRe  RevIew 
Glaucoma  Society  of  India  was  established  in  1990 with the aim of disseminating current practice  patterns and help ophthalmologists in different parts  India  upgrade  their  skills  to  promote  excellence  in  patent  care  and  help  preserve  their  vision  related  quality of life. It also organises nation wide glaucoma  courses in order to spread basic as well as updated

knowledge of glaucoma diagnosis and management  meant for all ophthalmologists: private practitioners,  ophthalmologists in private or government teaching  institutions  and  all  residents/postgraduates7.  
Few studies were conducted on country distribution  of ophthalmology and visual science literature. Davies,  Wilson  &  Hood8   studied  Australia's  contribution  to  vision science domain literature during 1991-95, using  ISI's SCI, SSCI, and AHCI databases. Zou, Wu & Wu9 analysed  961  ophthalmology,  optometry  and  visual  science  publications  of  China,  using  SCI  database  during 2000–2007. Kumaragurupari, Sieving & Lalitha10 analysed 2163 publications by Indian ophthalmologists  and  vision  researchers  during  2001-2006,  with  a  view  access  their  productivity,  analyse  trends  in  journal  choice,  publication  types,  research  funding  and  collaborative  research.  Publications  resulting  from international collaborations increased from 3%  in  2001  to  8  %  in  2006. The  major  focus  of  Indian  publications  was  on  cataract  and  clinical  science  articles  were  most  frequently  published  whereas  basic  science  the  least.  Only  one  scientometric  study  could  be  identified  on  glaucoma.  Consoli  and  Ramgoplan11   analysed  9361  world  glaucoma  papers  published  during  1973-2003  appearing  in  ISI  Thompson  database.  The  research  output  was  classified  into  26  sub-areas  and  5  broad  areas.  The  authors  searched  glaucoma  in  the  ‘Topic’  field  which  includes  title,  keywords  and  abstract  using  institutional  addresses  of  authors  as  a  guide  to  study  intra-organisational  and  inter-organisational  collaboration  across  research  units,  health  care  delivering  units  and  firms.

5.   m ethOdOlOGIeS And  SOuRce Of dAtA 
This study used Scopus International Database  [http://www.scopus.com/search/]  to  extract  relevant  data  on  glaucoma  research  of  world  and  other  15  most productive countries for the 10 years (2002-11).  An  advanced  search  strategy  involving  ‘glaucoma  or intraocular pressure’ as the keywords were used  to search and download data using ‘Title’, ‘Abstract’  and  ‘Keywords’  field,  resulting  in  downloading  of  1078  records  related  to  Indian  glaucoma  research.  Separate  strategies  were  developed  in  terms  of  keywords  for  identifying  different  type  of  glaucoma  research and glaucoma research output by different  population age groups. For identifying conjunctivitis  research  by  sub-fields,  database  classification  as  provided  in  Scopus  database  has  been  used.  For  analysing significant institutions, authors and journals,  separate  search  strategies  were  developed,  which  later  combined  with  the  main  string  lead  to  the  generation of the desired output. For citations data,  three  years,  two  years,  one  year  and  zero  year  citation  windows  have  been  used  for  computing  average citations per paper in conjunctivitis research  during 2002-08, 2009, 2010 and 2011. For example,  for  papers  published  in  2002,  citation  window  is  three  years  from  2002-05.  For  papers  published  in  2009, citation window is two years from 2009-2011  and  for  papers  published  in  2010  citation  window  is  one  year  2010-11.

India’s  global publications share increased from 3 % during  2002-06 to 3.45 % during 2007-11. The international  collaborative  papers  share  of  India  in  glaucoma  research  was  21.06  %  during  2002-11,  which  has  increased  from  17.92  %  during  2002-06  to  23.09  %  during  2007-11.  In  all  45  countries  participated  in international collaboration with India in glaucoma  research  during  2002-11.  The  largest  contribution  (share) to international collaborative papers of India  in  glaucoma  research  comes  from  uS  (50.22  %),  followed    by  uK  (21.59  %),  Singapore  (7.05%),  Germany  (5.29  %),  Italy  (3.08  %),  Brazil  (2.64  %),  Netherlands  (3.08  %),  China  (2.64  %),  Israel  (2.2  %),  Japan  (2.2  %).  
Among different types of glaucoma research in  India during 2002-11, the largest contribution (share)  (19.85 %) comes from open angle glaucoma, followed  by  closed  angle  glaucoma  (13.17  %),  congenital  glaucoma (8.53 %), normal tension glaucoma (7.14 %),  secondary glaucoma (5.01 %), neovascular glaucoma  (2.69 %), traumatic glaucoma (1.11 %), pigmentary  glaucoma (0.46%), pseudoexfoliative glaucoma (0.19  %  share)  and  Irido  Corneal  Endothelial  syndrome  (0.09 % share). The maximum focus of Indian glaucoma  research in terms of research output during 2002-11  was on adults (with 50 %), followed by middle aged  (27.83  %),  adolescents  (14.1  %),  child  (12.62  %),  and  aged  80  &  over  (7.14  %). Among  the  subfield  wise distribution of world glaucoma research during  2002-11,  the  largest  contribution  (88.03  %)  comes  from medicine, followed by pharmacology, toxicology  & pharmaceutics (10.85 %), neurosciences (9.83 %  share),  biochemistry,  genetics  &  molecular  biology  (5.47  %)  and  health  profession  (1.39  %).  The  top  15  most  productive  Indian  institutions  involved  in  glaucoma research have together contributed 66.42 %  share  in  the  cumulative  Indian  publications  output,  with an average of 47.73 papers per institution. The  average  citation  per  paper  and h-index  registered  
substantially  by  way  of  investment  in  R&D.  Both  research  output  and  quality  of  research  should  be  increased  and  strengthened  and  international  collaborative  research  may  further  be  widened  to  learn  from  the  experiences  of  other  countries.   The  glaucoma’s  irreversibility,  lacking  of  glaucoma  specialists and patients unawareness demand for an  economic and effective glaucoma diagnosis system  for screening. Disease control and elimination require  an  adequately  trained  functional  workforce  with  an  enabling  infrastructure  and  technology.  
Population awareness of the disease is low and  most  patients  attending  eye  clinics  do  not  receive  a  routine  comprehensive  eye  examination  that  is  required  to  detect  glaucoma  (and  other  potentially  blinding eye diseases). Such a routine is not taught  or  practiced  by  the  majority  of  training  institutions  either.  Glaucoma  cannot  be  managed  in  isolation.  The  objective  should  be  to  detect  and  manage  all  potential  causes  of  blindness  and  prevention  of  blindness  from  glaucoma  should  be  integrated  into  existing programs. The routine of comprehensive eye  examination  in  every  clinic  and  its  teaching  (and  use)  in  residency  programs  should  be  mandatory  for  the  detection  and  management  of  potentially  preventable  blinding  pathology  from  any  cause,  including  glaucoma.  It  is  suggested  that  their  is  need to develop eye care facilities in every district,  develop  human  resources  for  providing  eye  care  services,  improve  the  quality  of  service  delivery,  and  secure  participation  of  voluntary  organisation  in  eye  care.
