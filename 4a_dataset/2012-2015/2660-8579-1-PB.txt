ABSTRACT
The open source software (OSS) makes source code available to users, who can change the software
to modify it more closely to their own requirements. Now the OSS is available for library and information
management Examples of such systems include GSDL, DSpace, NewGenlib, Fedora, and Ganesha digital
library software, etc. The OSS is popular with technically sophisticated users, who are often also the software
developers. The OSS is becoming an increasingly popular software development method. This paper highlights
the comparison of features, functions and usability of OSS, i.e., GSDL, DSpace, E-Prints, Fedora, Ganesha,
Invenio, XTS, Dienst, VuDL, and NewGenlib. Ranking of the software have been done based on the assigned
points for each criteria. The GSDL scored maximum points, i.e., 47 and hence it is in rank first followed by
VuDL which scored 43 points.
Keywords: Digital library open source software, GSDL, DSpace, Fedora, Ganesha, E-Prints, Invenio, XTS, Dienst,
VuDL, NewGenlib

1. INTRODUCTION
Open source software (OSS) is software that
includes source code and is usually available at no
charge. There are additional requirements besides the
availability of source code that a program must meet
before it is considered open source including: the
software must be free to redistribute; derivative works
must be allowed; the license cannot discriminate against
any persons; and the license cannot discriminate against
any fields of endeavour. Software that is licensed under an
open source license allows for a community of developers
from around the world to improve the software by providing
enhancements and bug fixes1.
The services and the collection of the libraries and
information centers are becoming global due to the
application of information and communication technology.
Now information can be accessed from the remote places
with the help of internet. Due to shrinking budgets and the
increasing prices of journals, librarians have to look
forward to a new alternative by which they can collect,
store, arrange, and disseminate information to the users.
The concept of open access and institutional repository
(IR) has evolved to find out the solutions. In building the IR
the college libraries can take the help of the OSS13.

The term ‘software’ refers to two different but related
things:
Source code: A set of human readable and
understandable instructions that comprise the ‘recipe’
from which program can be made.
Object code: Actual program which is compiled of
machine readable source code. It is fed into a computer’s
microprocessor to perform various operations. The
advocates of what we think of as the open source
movements add further conditions before they regard
software as open source.
Some essentials are:

•

The source is publicly available

•

The software can be distributed freely

•

The sources may be studied and changed

Free software is a matter of the users’ freedom to run,
copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom, for the
users of the software to

•

•

Study how the program works

•

•

Redistribute copies so one can help neighbour

•

Improve the program, and release improvements to
the public, for the benefit of whole community.

2. FEATURES OF OSS
Open source doesn’t just mean access to the source
code. The distribution terms of OSS must comply with the
following criteria:

No provision of the license may be predicated on any
individual technology or style of interface12

3. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

•
•

To compare 10 OSS for building digital library.
To find out and rank the more user-friendly OSS
based on the comparative study.

4. METHODOLOGY AND SCOPE

•

Free redistribution

Investigative and evaluative research methodology
were used for the study. Data were collected:

•

Source code

•

•

Derived works

•

Integrity of the author’s source code

By surfing internet and downloading ten OSS such as
Greenstone Digital Library (GSDL), Dspace,
Ganesha, Fedora, E-Prints, Invenio, Dienst, VuDL,
XTS, NewGenlib .

•

No discrimination against persons or groups

•

Comparing the selected OSS.

•

No discrimination against fields of endeavour

•

•

Distribution of license

Preparing the worksheet by using different criteria of
selected OSS.

•

License must not be specific to a product.

•

license must not restrict other software

Scope of the study is restricted to surfing internet and
downloading the 10 OSS i.e. GSDL, DSpace, Ganesha
Fedora, E-Prints, Invenio, Dienst, Vu-DL, XTF, and
NewGenlib (Table 1).

5. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATIONS

version (Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000,
Windows NT and Windows XP, Windows 7), Linux, UNIX,
and other. Maximum 9 points has been acquired by EPrint because it is window-based as well as it can be run
on LINUX/UNIX based operating system and also run in
any other operating system.

There are various OSS but for the current study only
10 software were selected. The features of software were
studied by applying some criteria like, searching
facilities, platform to run software, associated software,
languages included in software, searching parameters of
software and after analysing grading of 10 OSS have been
done based on the assigned points for each parameters.

Table 6 shows languages that are supported by the
selected OSS and are readily available for use. As per
requirement, the user can choose and change the language
according to his convenience for handling the software
(Table 7). Table 8 shows the facilities provided by selected
OSS such as provision of searching or browsing, multilanguages support multimedia. It also gives the information
of other facilities such as web OPAC, metadata, catalogue,
retro-conversion, internet, intranet, and extranet, etc.
Maximum selected OSS provides all facilities’ except
Ganesha, XTF, and NewGenlib. Maximum numbers (10) of
searching parameters have been found in GSDL followed by
DSpace. A maximum point 14 has been acquired by GSDL
followed by DSpace and Invenio.

Table 2 shows the latest version of software that is
readily available for the use and also gives the information
about the year in which new version was released it also
specifies, the site address from which the user can
download the particular software. It is observed from Table
4 that maximum, i.e., 10 pre-requisite software have been
required by E-Prints software followed by Fedora, i.e. 9.
Dienst and NewGenlib required minimum three prerequisite software.
Table 5 shows that the selected OSS run on different
operating systems. Some of the software run on Windows

share is that they are flexible, and can be customised and
modified at many different levels–including the
programming level since they are open source systems.
This gives the ultimate flexibility and yields significant
advantages over closed-source systems.
(a) All the OSS are freely available and some are under
the GNU (General Public License) license.
(b) It is also observed that to run this software they need
pre-requisite software. This software can be used to
make sophisticated computational techniques
accessible to everyone.

6. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
The study of OSS is restricted within the study of the
features of the software. They represent rather different
perspectives, and have different and in many ways
complementary, goals and strengths. One goal they
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(5)

(c) GSDL and DSpace software’s metadata is difficult to
create because cataloguer entry operator must know
xml or html language, and only expertise in this
language can do this work very easily, while in the
other software there is no need to have the knowledge
of xml or html languages.
(d) All the 10 selected OSS support internet, and intranet
searching/browsing, multimedia, and web OPAC,
etc., except XTF software. In this brief study, it is clear
that this software would be applicable to fully digitised
library and most of the library material can be
expanded in the form of CDs, DVDs, etc.
(e) Among ten selected OSS, E-Print required maximum
number of pre-requisite software for installing, i.e., 10
(90.90 %), followed Fedora (81.81 %) and GSDL
(63.63 %).
(f) It has been observed that E-Prints software runs on
maximum number of operating system while

NewGenlib runing only in Linux operating system.
(g) OSS is supporting different language, GSDL, Invenio
and VuDL support maximum number of languages,
i.e., 9 languages as compared to other software
whereas Ganesha software supports only one
language, i.e., English (Table 6).
(h) GSDL, DSpace, Fedora, E-Prints, Invenio, Dienst,
and VuDL are providing maximum number of facilities,
i.e., 10 (100 %) as compare to Ganesha software,
XTF, and NewGenlib (Table 8).
(i) Searching parameters of each software were studied
and it is observed that GSDL has maximum number of
searching parameters, i.e., 100 per cent, 70 per cent
of searching parameters are provided by DSpace,
Invention, and VuDL whereas Ganesha, E-Prints, XTF
and NewGenlib software provided less than 70 per
cent of searching parameters (Table 10 and 11).
(j) It is also recorded that GSDL, DSpace, E-Prints,
398

Invenio and VuDL comes under excellent grades (4050 points).
(k) GSDL scored maximum number of points i.e., 47
followed by VuDL, E-Print, DSpace and Invenio. (Table
12 and 13).

7. CONCLUSIONS
The implementation of OSS in library represents a
method for improving library services. All OSS is governed
by some type of license agreement. Library professionals
should know how to set up and build digital library
collection in their organisation.
The OSS interface makes it easy for people to create
their own library collections. Collections may be built and
served locally from the users own web server, or remotely
on a shared digital library host. End users can easily build
new collections styled after existing ones from material
on the web or from their local files (or both), and

collections can be updated and new ones brought online
at any time. The OSS has much potential for libraries and
information centers, and there are a number of projects,
including GSDL, DSpace, Ganesha, E-prints, Fedora,
etc., that demonstrate capabilities in this context. It gives
library staff an option to be actively involved in
development projects, and this involvement can take
many forms, such as reporting, suggesting
enhancements, and testing new versions.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(5)

Currently available OSS projects cover application
areas ranging from the traditional library management
systems to innovations like GSDL and DSpace, which
complement traditional systems. Benefits include low
costs of maintenance, greater accessibility, and better
prospects for long-term preservation of scholarly works.
The GSDL and DSpace are recommended to build the
digital libraries and make them accessible globally.
