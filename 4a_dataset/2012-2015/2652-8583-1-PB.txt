ABSTRACT
To provide a general context for library implementations of open source software (OSS), the purpose
of this paper is to assess and evaluate the awareness and adoption of OSS by the LIS professionals working
in various engineering colleges of Odisha. The study is based on survey method and questionnaire technique
was used for collection data from the respondents. The study finds that although the LIS professionals of
engineering colleges of Odisha have knowledge on OSS, their uses in libraries are in budding stage. Suggests
that for the widespread use of OSS in engineering college libraries of Odisha, a cooperative and participatory
organisational system, positive attitude of authorities and LIS professionals, proper training provision for LIS
professionals need to be developed.
Keywords: Open source software, Engineering college, LIS professionals

1. INTRODUCTION
The open source software (OSS) phenomenon has
become a trend in IT industries during last decades with
the increasing numbers of OSS users and availability of
OSS software in a large variety of domain. This trend can
be well realised in library and information science field
also. The main reason of this is the choice of freedom.
Contrary to proprietary or closed source programs such
as Windows, Oracle, etc., in OSS, the source code is
available for users to modify and make improvement to it.
Accordingly, if a user encounters a bug or face a problem,
he/she can fix the error without relying on the vendor,
which is time consuming and frustrating. Also the users
have options to modify and make improvement in the
programs as per the need with the help of available source
code. Thus, there is scope to use the talent of user and
customise the software as per requirement. Further, the
absence of license restrictions and the possibility of
interpolation with other applications make OSS more
popular day by day. “The OSS offers libraries an attractive
solution. Library end users with technical and
nontechnical skills can participate in OSS installation and
maintenance, librarians can engage in OSS development

and modifications, and library user groups can often
customise OSS environments. Moreover, OSS is an
important library solution, for there exists a large usebase for OSS applications, a wide variety of available
OSS tools, and a multitude of OSS support channels”1
The concept on OSS that it is absolutely free seems
to be impractical. Although unlike commercial software
there is no initial purchase fees or license fees or upgrade
fees, but it requires an investment of time and effort by
users like other commercial software. The benefits of
OSS are compelling libraries towards the use of OSS
software and many libraries have adopted these software
for various purposes more specifically for automation,
creation of digital library, institutional repositories, etc.
The paper is an attempt to make a study on the
awareness and adaptation of OSS by the LIS
professionals of Engineering Colleges of Odisha.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
A good number of studies on OSS, its history and
case studies in libraries have been carried out by
students, research scholars, and teachers of various

institutions all over the world. Giri & Sengar2 in their paper
have provided an insight into the practical implementation
aspects of OSS for managing the activities and services
of a library. They have identified that the main pre-requisite
of OSS use in libraries is the librarian’s potentiality to
harness the staff motivation in a positive way. They found
that OSS is more future oriented and is an suitable low
cost alternative to their proprietary counterpart. Biswas &
Paul3 in their study have made an evaluation of DSpace
and GSDL. They have tried to identify the extent of
adoption of open source digital library software packages
in various organisations through an online survey.

This study is based on survey (questionnaire) method.
A structured questionnaire was designed and distributed
to collect data from the LIS professionals of engineering
colleges of Odisha which were affiliated to BPUT by the
year 2010 keeping in mind the basic objectives of the
study. Besides, personal interviews were also conducted
with library and information science professionals and
experts to assess the problems related to use of OSS.

Bissels4 discussed OSS installation at the Royal
London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH) and described the
transition to the Koha 3.0 library management system
(LMS) as the library’s primary information access
framework. He has stated that Koha, an open source ILS,
fulfilled the needs and goals of a specialised medical
library institution. Goh5, et al. introduced an evaluation of
four open source DL products with the intended result of a
standardised methodology for the selection of OSS for
DL5.

The questionnaires were distributed to 202 LIS
professionals (2 professional from each engineering
college on random sampling basis), out of which 148
filled-in questionnaires (73.27 %) were collected. Hence,
in all case the total number of respondents will be 148.
The data collected through the questionnaires was
scrutinized, classified, and tabulated for better
understanding and clarity. To make the data analysis
statistically sound, various statistical techniques such as
percentage, arithmetic mean, and weighted arithmetic
mean have been used.

3. OBJECTIVES
The basic objective of the study is to make an
analysis of the use and awareness of OSS among the LIS
professionals working in engineering colleges of Odisha.
However the other objectives of the study are to:
(a) Identify the types of OSS skills possessed by the LIS
professionals working in engineering colleges of
Odisha
(b) Assess the application of OSS by LIS professionals
in libraries
(c) Find out the reasons of low use of OSS by LIS
professionals

4. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF STUDY

are of other designation such as Junior Librarian,
Professional Assistant, etc. Regarding professional
qualification of respondents, the data analysis shows that
as high as 106 (71.62 %) respondents out of 148 have
MLIS qualification.

Automation has become the basic necessity for
libraries of all kind and many libraries are adopting OSS
for library automation due to several advantages
associated with this. Realising the importance of library
automation, the respondents were asked about to their
knowledge on open source library automation software
and the collected data is tabulated in Table 3.

6.2 Knowledge of Computers and ICT
The analysis of data collected on respondents’
knowledge on computer and ICT reveals that all respondents
are computer literate and have sound knowledge on the
various ICT tools available in libraries. It seems to be a
healthy sign for the engineering colleges of Odisha.

The analysis of data of Table 3 reveals that ISIS/CDS
is most popular OSS with weight arithmetic mean value of
39.2. It is followed by other OSS such as Library
Management System, Koha, NewGenLib, PhpMyLibrary,
and OpenBiblio with weighted arithmetic mean value of
30.4, 19.4, 18.4, 17.3 and 16.3, respectively.

6.3 Knowledge of Open Source Operating
System
Knowledge on operating system is the primary
requisite to handle computer systems. The respondents
were asked about their knowledge on open source
operating system on the basis of self assessment and
data is tabulated in Table 2. The analysis of data shows
that as per the weighted arithmetic mean, more number of
users is conversant with Ubunto followed by Fedora,
SUSE, Dream Linux and Unix with the weighted
arithmetic mean value of 30.8, 25.8, 23.7, 21.5 and 21.2,
respectively.

6.5 Knowledge of Digital Library OSS
The new trends of modern libraries are towards
creation of digital library/institutional repositories and
many libraries are using OSS for their creation.
Accordingly, the present study attempts to know about
the respondents’ knowledge on these OSS. The data
collected on this have been tabulated in Table 4.

on future trends of OSS in libraries data analysis
indicates that as high as 97 (65.54 %) respondents out of
148 opined towards a negative trends. Also, 31 (20.95 %)
opined towards a positive trend and 20 respondents
(13.51 %) did not comment on this.

7. SUGGESTIONS
On the basis of findings, followings suggestions have
been made to enhance the use of OSS in engineering
college libraries by LIS professionals of Odisha.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(5)

•

Adequate training provision for LIS professionals of
engineering colleges of Odisha need to be developed
by the parent institutions to train them on OSS and its
use in libraries.

•

Although LIS professionals of Odisha possess fair
knowledge on different OSS, its use in engineering
college libraries are not up to the satisfactory level.
Hence, the authorities of these libraries need to be
cooperative towards LIS professionals and some
autonomy must be given to them, so that they can
prove their talent in using OSS comfortably.

•

It is seen that even if a good number of LIS
professionals possess knowledge on OSS for
creation of DL/IR, the availability of them in
engineering college libraries of Odisha are quite few in
numbers due to lack of cooperation from authorities.
Hence, a conducive library environment and welldefined policy need to be developed by the parent
institutions, which will be helpful for LIS professionals
to create DLs/IRs by using OSS.

•

•

•

•

The LIS professionals need to be encouraged by the
authorities to use OSS for library automation, who
can’t afford for proprietary/commercial software due to
financial constraints. The authorities need to provide
necessary infrastructure and moral support to LIS
professionals to not to hesitate to take a risk.
The OSS needs to introduce in the course curriculum
of the LIS courses of Universities of Odisha, so that
the future LIS professionals will be well trained in
using OSS in libraries.
The LIS professionals of engineering college of
Odisha need to be more IT savvy and should possess
a positive attitude with adequate knowledge on OSS
through formal and informal training programs, so that
they will be capable and confident in using OSS for
various library applications.
The OSS developers and experts need to play a
important role to make it popular among LIS
professionals of engineering colleges of Odisha
through publications of good literature on OSS,
organising workshop/seminars on OSS, etc.

8. CONCLUSIONS
The OSS is a software development and distribution
model where the source code of program is made freely
available with the software itself so that one can modify it
as per requirement and also distribute it provided they
abide by the accompanying license. Thus, the freedom to

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(5)

modify the software has made it popular, more specifically
in libraries, which has facilitated the designing of software
in providing library services as per the users’ requirement.
The OSS is also an economical alternative to libraries’
dependence upon proprietary/commercial software. It
ensures more functional library system and services.
However, OSS is not always easy to use and is therefore
largely inaccessible to many libraries. The basic problem
is that most OSS are written by programmers who do not
understand the end-user needs and whose software is
often complex and difficult to use.
Further, it lacks proper documentation and is more
expert dependent. But it is fact that OSS is essential if
libraries are to develop software and systems that meet
their patrons’ needs satisfactorily. Hence, the LIS
professionals need to develop a positive attitude towards
use of OSS to tailor various library services in their own
ways.
The paper finds that although the LIS professionals of
engineering colleges of Odisha have knowledge on OSS,
their uses in libraries are in budding stage. A cooperative
and participatory organisational system, positive attitude
of authorities and LIS professionals, and proper training
provision for LIS professionals need to be developed for
the widespread use of OSS in these libraries.
