Information needs of library users are affected by many factors such as, qualifcation, sex, age, teaching  and  research  experience,  socio-economic  background  of  users,  availability  of  information  sources  and  services in libraries, motivation, professional orientation, and other individual characteristics of the users.  The study attempts to identify various factors such as, age, gender, qualifcation, designation teaching  and research experience, and their effect on the information needs of the faculty members of Teachers  Training Institutions of Odisha. Survey method with questionnaire techniques was used for collection of  data. The fndings of the study indicate that the faculty members with higher qualifcations visit  libraries  more frequently, the duration of use of library by a faculty does not have any relationships with his/her  designation, faculty with more teaching and research experience make more use of library in terms of  
frequency of visit to library and duration of use, etc.

1.  INTrOducTION 
From  the  time  immoral,  information  has  remained  as  an  important  component  for  growth  and development of intellectual capabilities of human  being.  Library,  being  the  knowledge  centre,  has  the  responsibilities  to  cater  the  information  need  of  users  through  proper  acquisition,  organisation,  and dissemination of information. Information needs  of  library  users  are  affected  by  many  factors  such  as  qualification,  sex,  age,  teaching  and  research  experience,  socio-economic  background  of  users,  availability  of  information  sources  and  services  in  libraries,  motivation,  professional  orientation,  and  other  individual  characteristics  of  the  users.  Due  to  this  contingency  nature,  generalised  one-time  conclusions  about  information  needs  of  users  are  impracticable.  
In  any  academic  institutions,  Faculty  members  not  only  teach  their  students  on  the  designed  syllabus, but also guide research and projects, and  simultaneously  look  to  their  career  development.  In  a  fast  growing  society  of  the  modern  era,  there  is  an  enormous  change  in  the  study  curriculum  to  cope  with  the  demands. The  teaching  process  and  equipments  is  changing  to  cope  to  the  psychology  and interest of the students taught. Accordingly the  information  need  of  faculty  members  seems  to  be  
vast, exhaustive, pin pointed, and ever changing. The  libraries  attached  to  the  academic  institutions  are  expected to have the adequate sources and services  to  cater  the  needs  of  information  by  the  faculty  member’s. Poor infrastructure facilities, disorganised  reading  materials  and  complex  rules  and  practices  in  the  library  result  in  its  reduced  use  of  library.  
However, the need factors of the faculty create  the intensity on the purpose for needing information,  which drives one to use library. Hence, the frequency  and  duration  of  use  of  library  are  the  indications  of  the  information  needs  of  the  faculty.  The  need  factors tend to be governed by the personal factors  of  the  users  like  age,  gender,  qualification,  posts  hold,  teaching  and  research  experience,  etc.  The  study  attempts  to  find  out  the  factors  which  affect  the information needs of faculty members of Teachers  Training  Institutions  of  Odisha. 
2.  ObjecTIves ANd  scOpe 
The  basic  objective  of  the  study  is  to  find  out  the factors which affect the information need of the  faculty  members  of  Teachers  Training  institutions  of  Odisha.  However  the  other  objectives  of  the  study  are  to:

Rouse & Rouse1  in their study found that human  information seeking is generally affected by pay-offs  and  cost,  resources  available,  expected  value  of  gambles, update rates, amount of information available,  diagnosticity  of  data,  distributional  characteristics  of  data,  and  conflict  among  sources.  They  argue  further  that  although  human  behavior  is  affected  by  all  of  these  factors,  humans  usually  respond  to manipulations of these variables in less than an  optimal manner. Ren2  in his study on small business  executives,  finds  that  their  information  searching  was  affected  by  factors  such  as,  their  information  need,  availability  awareness  and  individual,  and  company  background  characteristics.

5.1 classified data  of  the respondents 
Regarding classified data of the respondents, the  data analysis revealed that out of 163 respondents,  111  (68.1  %)  were  male,  while  52  (31.9  %)  were  female.  Regarding  qualification,  it  was  found  that  as  high  as  65  (39.87  %)  respondents  were  Post  Graduate (PG), followed by 62 (38.04 %) were PhD  and  36  (22.09  %)  had  MPhil  qualification.  
Further,  the  analysis  of  data  revealed  that  respondents were having PhD degrees to the extent  of  38.04  %,  i.e.,  more  than  one  in  three.  But  on  analysis  based  on  the  gender  of  respondents  separately,  it  was  found  that  the  females  had  PhD  degree constitutes 50 % of their total number against  32.43 % in case of the males. Similarly the male and  female ratio regarding MPhil qualification was 27 and  9,  while  PG  qualification  ratio  was  48  and  17.

The study was based on cross sectional survey  method. Questionnaire technique was selected for the  study. A structured questionnaire was designed on the  basis of objectives of the study for collection of data.  The entire population, i.e., regular faculty members  of  all  government  Teachers  Training  Institutions  of

From Table  1  it  was  found  that  the  percentage  of respondents with PhD, MPhil and PG qualification  visited  the  libraries  most  frequently,  i.e.,  1-2  times  a  week  are  54.84,  38.89,  and  23.08  respectively.

used library for 6-12 hours per week. Similarly, the  respondents with MPhil & PG qualification use library  for less than 6 hours per week with a response rate of 41.66  %,  and  52.30  %  respectively. 
5.3  effect  of  designation  
To  find  out  whether  there  is  any  relationship  existing between the quantum of need of information  
Table  4  shows  that  12  Professors  spend  6-12  hours  per  week  while  12  Readers  apend  12-18  hours  per  week.  44  %  Sr  Lecturer  and  50.79  %  Lecturer  spend  less  than  6  hours. 
5.4  effect  of  Teaching  and  research  
experience 
Analysis  was  done  to  explore  if  the  teaching  
and the posts hold (designation) by the respondents,  
experience  and  research  experience  of  a  faculty  
the  surveyed  data  have  been  compiled  for  comparison between the designation hold and their  corresponding frequency and duration of using library,  and the results are as contained in Table 3 and 4. 
Table 3 reveals that the Senior Lecturers to the  
made him/her equipped to seek more information for  further enhancement of knowledge or feel satisfied  with  what  he/she  gathered  resulting  in  reduced  information seeking behavior. In this regard, separate  analysis  for  both  the  factors  were  made  from  the  
extent  of  50  %  visit  the  libraries  more  frequently,  
surveyed  data  and  compared  with  the  frequency  i.e.,  1  to  2  times  a  week  followed  by  Lecturers

of respondents (43.14 %) with teaching experience  of  21  years  and  above  and  16-20  years  (43.9  %)  use library for 6-12 hours per week. It was followed  by maximum respondents with teaching experience  of  11-15  years  (55.26  %),  6-10  years  (73.92  %),  and  5  years  and  below  (70  %)  uses  the  library  for  less  than  6  hours  per  week. 
Table 7 revealed that the percentages of respondents  frequently visiting  the library with research experience  above 15 years, 11 to 15 years, 6 to 10 years and up  to 5 years were 40, 40, 39.06 and 36.73 respectively  which  show  that  respondents  with  more  research  
week to the extent of 13.33, 8.57, 4.69 and 2.04 %  respectively,  and  12  to  18  hours  a  week  to  the  extent  of  60,  28.57,  25,  and  8.16  %  respectively. 
6.  FINdINgs 
From  the  analysis  of  data,  the  major  findings  of  the  study  are  summarised  as: 
(a) Female  faculty  members  of  Teachers  Training  
Institutions  of  Odisha  are  more  qualified  than  
the  male  faculty  members 
(b) Majority of respondents visit the institutional libraries  
once  or  twice  in  a  month  to  the  extent  
experience tend to visit the library more frequently.  
(c) Average  time  spent  on  the  library  by  a  faculty  
In  the  next  category  of  frequency  of  use  of  library,  i.e.,  1  to  2  times  a  month,  the  percentages  were  53.33,  48.57,  48.44,  and  44.9  respectively  for  the  
per  week  has  been  estimated  as  8  hours  and  18  minutes  
above  research  experience  group  of  respondents.  
(d) Faculty  members  with  higher  qualifications  
Table  8  revealed  that  the  respondents  belonging  to  the  above  groups  of  experience  mentioned  in  the  table    use  the  library  for  above  18  hours  a

During  recent  years  information  has  become  extremely  pervasive  and  has  spread  vastly  in  its  contents and dimensions. Also information has become  significant  part  of  study  and  research  for  all  types  of  users,  more  particularly  for  faculty  members.  Hence  it  has  become  very  important  for  academic  libraries  to  assess  and  evaluate  the  information  needs of faculty members continuously and acquire  necessary  resources  for  catering  their  information  need.  The  present  study  reveals  a  healthy  picture  on  the  use  of  libraries  by  the  faculty  members  of  Teachers  Training  Institutions  of  Odisha.  It  is  also  encouraging fact that the faculty members with higher  qualification  and  experience  (teaching/research)  use  library  more  in  terms  of  frequency  of  visit  and  duration  of  use.  However,  the  library  professionals  and  authorities  of  these  libraries  need  to  acquire  more  relevant  resources  and  provide  better  library  services to retain these trends in future. Also keeping  pace  with  the  changing  library  environment,  the  libraries  of  Teachers  Training  Institutions  need  to  introduce  ICT-based  library  services,  so  that  they  can  cater  the  information  need  of  faculty  members  more  satisfactorily.
