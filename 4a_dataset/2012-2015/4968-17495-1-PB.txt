The purpose of this paper was to identify the existing criteria of various conventional databases that  are considered in evaluating journals in the scholarship of library & information science (LIS) journals and  accordingly developed a tool box to evaluate some selected journals of LIS in South Asian Association  of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. Journals have been evaluated by applying 30 criteria based  on  the  current  measures  used  by Thompson  Reuter,  SCOPUS,  SciELO,  LISA,  LISTA,  etc. The  result  indicates that although there are a considerable number of journals being published in India since long  time, only a few journals are qualitatively strong. The review policy as mentioned in documentation, subject  coverage can be considered as their strength, the geographic non-diversity of members in Editorial Board,  contributors are their weakness. Most of journals are indexed in LISA and LISTA, however no journals  are yet to include in JCR. Overall, to cope-up with international standard journals need to consider their  publication policy thoroughly. The fndings of the study seems to be useful for (a) academics – to know  the list of journals which adhere to the quality requirements of LIS discipline; (b) librarians – to know the  core LIS journals of SAARC countries in LIS discipline for their clients; (c) policy makers – to measure the  weightage of publication, while evaluating performance for career and promotion, to evaluate individual  research performance, while releasing grants for academic projects.

1. INtRODUCtION 
Joshua  Lederberg  (the  Nobel  Prize  recipient)  in  his  speech  entitled  ‘Communication  as  the  Root  of  Scientific  Progress’1   indicated  the  significance  of  scholarly  literature,  scholarly  publishing  and  scholarly communication for the progress of science.  Traditional forms of formal scholarly communication  are research articles, letters, memos, conferences,  technical  reports,  monographs,  edited  books,  etc.  Kling & Callhan2  categorise various forms of scholarly  communication  as:  
(a) Social and socio-technical research literature like  
e-journals,  research  monographs,  specialised  
research  conference;  
(b) Technological research literature which includes  
analytical examination of technological standards  
and  design  strategies;  
(c) Practitioner literature (professional writing) where  
primary audience includes publishers, librarians,  
academic  administrators  and  faculty  who  may

publish in e-media, organise electronic collections,  
evaluate  such  electronic  publications;  and  (d) Scholarly  electronic  forums.  
All these genres have well defined advantages  and  disadvantages.  However,  among  all,  the  well  accepted form of scholarly communication is social and  socio-technical research literature especially journals  or its electronic counterpart e-journals. This type of  literature is not only efficient in providing most up- to-date and advanced information but it also fulfills  certification requirement rather well because it also  provides  reviewed  output  as  print.  The  main  focus  of this study is to address qualitative issues related  primarily to the social and socio-technical research  literature  especially  journals  that  are  widely  used  for  formal  system  of  scholarly  communication. 
A  number  of  journals  are  prevailing  today  in  the  discipline  of  library  and  information  science.  Academic  promotion  and  tenure  decisions  take  into consideration the significance of a candidate’s

publications. However, we do not have any mechanism  to  measure  quality  of  an  article  with  others.  One  criterion  may  be  the  citation  and  impact.  However,  this  has  not  always  been  the  case  for  the  journals  of  this  region  because  of  very  little  coverage  for  journals  in  international  citation  databases  of  this  region. The intention of the present study is to develop  uniform criteria of evaluating quality of journal which  is not based on the quantitative issues related with  publications. Very little research has used qualitative  methods  to  evaluate  LIS  journal  quality.  
SAARC  is  acronym  used  for  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation,  which  is  an  association  of  eight  developing  nations  of  South  Asian  region.  It  was  officially  established  in  1985  with  the  cooperation  of  governments  of  Bhutan,  Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and  Maldives. A new member Afghanistan has joined this  group in 2007. The study covers the evaluation of LIS  journals in the member countries of this Association.  
2. LIS  JOURNAL  PUbLISHING  IN  SAARC  
COUNtRIES 
Among the SAARC countries, India was the first  to  start  a  LIS  journal,  entitled  ‘Library  Miscellany ’  in  1912,  published  by  State  library  department,  Baroda. It stopped publishing in 1920, but it opened  the way for publishing journals in the field of LIS in  India. After  that  many  associations  and  institutions  related  to  library  and  information  science  research  were  established  in  India.  A  few  of  them  engaged  to  promote  LIS  education  and  research  in  India,  a  large number, however, of them established just to  start  publishing  journals  in  LIS  field.  
In  1933  Indian  Library  Association  (ILA)  came  into existence. ILA published Library Bulletin  (1942  to 1946) and ABgILA (which was a combo of three  journals  Annals ,  Bulletin   and  Granthalaya   of  ILA)  from  1949  to  1952.  from  1953  the  nomenclature  of  these  journals  was  changed  to  ILA  Bulletin .  In  2011, again its name changed to Journal  of  Indian  Library Association   (JILA). 
In Pakistan, the LIS journal publications started  after the establishment of Pakistan Library Association  in  1964.  The  first  LIS  publication,  The  Pakistan Library Bulletin  (PLB), came out in 1968. This only  journal of Pakistan is entitled as Pakistan Journal of  Library  &  Information  Science   (PJLIS)  after  2003.  
In Bangladesh there are two well known publications  in  field  of  Library  and  Information  Science:  The Eastern  Librarian   (EL)  started  its  publication  in  1965 by Library Association of Bangladesh followed  by Bangladesh  Journal  of  Library  and  Information  Science   (BJLIS)  which  started  publishing  in  1998.  
In Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Library Association (SLLA)  founded in 1960, and started publishing of Sri Lanka  Library  Review.  There  are  two  more  publications  entitled as: Journal of University Librarians Association 
(JULA)  of  Sri  Lanka  and  Sri  Lankan  Journal  of  Librarianship  &  Information  management   (SLLIM). 
In  Nepal TULSSAA: A  Journal  of  Library  and  Information Science  is the only publication in this field,  published  by  Tribhvuan  University  Library  Science  Students' Alumni Association. In Afghanistan, KETAB,  publication  in  this  field,  published  by  Kabul  Public  Library. Another two member countries of this association  are Bhutan and Maldives which have no publications  in  field  of  library  and  information  science. 
3. LItERAtURE  REVIEW 
Examining the literature in scholarly communication,  it  has  been  found  that  LIS  journals  are  evaluated  by  various  quantitative  and  qualitative  techniques  other  than  the  impact  factor3-7.  Day  &  Peter8   and  later  Nkereuwem9   used  qualitative  methods  to  ask  subscribers  and  authors,  plus  some  editors  and  editorial  advisors,  as  to  what  they  thought  about  the  quality  of  a  journal10.  
In a study, Nisonger11  provided a list of published  studies of LIS journals as well as a list of the criteria  used to compile the citation ranking of the journals  in  these  studies.  The  178  LIS  journals  studied  by  him  were  classified  in  terms  of  criteria  used  and  fell predominantly into four categories of citation (94  studies), production (33 studies), subjective judgment  (25),  and  reading  (18  studies).  The  remaining  8  studies used miscellaneous criteria such as familiarity,  readability/  reading  ease,  currency  of  citation,  etc.  Rousseau12  summarised the 10 characteristics of a  ‘quality’  journal  by  reviewing  Zwemer13, garfield14,  and  Testa15.  These  ten  criteria  are:  
(1)  Acceptance  and  rejection  rates;  
(2)  Subject  and  geographical  representativeness  
of  the  editorial  board;  
(3)  Use  of  a  critical  refereeing  system;  
(4)  Promptness  of  publication;  
(5)  Coverage  by  major  abstracting  and  indexing  
services;  
(6)  High  confidence  level  of  scientists  using  the  
journal  in  its  contents;  
(7)  High  frequency  of  citation  by  other  journals  
(impact);  
(8)  Inclusion  of  abstracts/summaries  in  English;  (9)  Providing author(s) addresses (author reputation  
score);  and  
(10)Providing  complete  bibliographic  information.  
4. ObJECtIVES 
The present study has been undertaken to confirm  whether quality indicator of journal evaluation can be  considered as a supplementary method of evaluation for journals which are yet to be indexed in JCR. As  a case study, the researchers began in LIS discipline.

The  objective  of  the  present  study  are  to:  • Develop  a  mechanism  for  evaluating  journal  
quality at par with conventional indexing databases  
for  those  journals  where  quality  assessment  
through  If   is  unavailable.  
• Evaluate quality of LIS journals originated from SAARC  
countries  by  applying  the  developed  criteria. 
5. MEtHODOLOGY 
The overall methodology for this study consisted  of  two  stages:  identification,  and  evaluation.  To  identify  the  journals  of  the  SAARC  region,  along  with Ulrich International Periodical Directory (2012)  following  web  directories  were  also  consulted:  • Directory of Open Access Journals (Lund University  
Library) 
• IndianJournals.com 
• Indian  Citation  Index 
• SCOPUS 
• EBSCOhost

To  judge  and  evaluate  journal,  established  criteria  as  laid  down  by  five  most  popular  indexing  and abstracting databases for incorporating journals  into  their  databases  were  consulted.  They  are:  Thomson  Institute  for  Scientific  Information  (ISI)  Database, SCOPUS database; Scientific Electronic  Library Online (SciELO) database, Brazil; MEDLINE  database; and Ulrich International Periodical Directory  of R.R. Bowker (2012). On consulting these criteria  a  toolbox  of  30  criteria  has  been  developed.  The  newly  developed  criteria  were  deployed  to  20  LIS  journal  of  Indian  origin  along  with  8  LIS  journals  of  rest  of  the  other  countries  from  SAARC  region.  A  framework  of  criteria  is  mentioned  in  Table  1.

as mentioned in Table 1, qualititative features of 20  journals  were  measured.  The  result  is  indicated  in  Annexure-I. few striking issues which are different  from  journal  to  journal  are:

However,  it  was  dificult  to  identify  any  separate  ISSN  number  for  online  edition  of  any  eight  journals  of  the  rest  of  the  SAARC  countries. PJLIS,  EL,  BJLIS,  SLR,  SLLIM,  JULA, TULSSAA, KETAB  all these journals although  available  on  web,  they  are  only  the  web  version  of  print  edition.

DJLIT,  VOL.  34,  NO.  2, MARCH   2014 
6.2  Nature  of  Publishing  and  Sponsoring  body  
Of the total 20 Indian LIS journals, 12 journals  are  being  published  by  non-profit  organisations  and  academics  and  all  journals  from  rest  of  the  SAARC  countries  are  being  published  by  such  organisations.  Commercial  bodies  have  shown  little  interest  in  publishing  LIS  journals  as  there  are  only  few  commercial  bodies  including  Taru  Publication, New Delhi; Priyanka Research Journal  Publication, Tamilnadu; E-library Science Research  Journal  (LSRJ),  Solapur  are  involved  in  publishing  LIS  journals  from  India  (Table  2).  
6.3 Longevity 
Exploring longevity issue reveals that  JILA   (79  years)  is  the  oldest  journal  (although  in  different  name) in Indian LIS publication history followed by  ALIS   (60  years),  and  IASLIC  Bulletin   (56  years).  The SRELS   (48),  and  DJLIT   (32)  are  another  two  important  journals  in  Indian  LIS  journal  history  among the rest of the SAARC countries, The Eastern  Librarian   (48  years)  of  the  Bangladesh,  Pakistan  Journal of Library and Information science  (45 years)  of Pakistan and Sri Lanka Library Review  (27 years)  of Sri Lanka are three prestigious journals that are  surviving  since  last  few  decades.  
6.4 Promptness  in  Publication 
To judge this criterion,  the publications  promptness  was categorised under four categories: fully regular  (fR),  mostly  regular  (MR),  mostly  irregular  (MIR),   and  consecutively  irregular  (CIR).  Subsequently  it  was also verified whether the journal has published  any combined issue in the last 5 years. The results  indicate  that  of  the  total  20  Indian  LIS  journal  7  journals have maintained complete regularity while 4  journals were mostly regular, and 6 journals awere  mostly irregular. Regularity status of three journals  were  not  available.  In  contrast,  no  journals  of  the  rest  of  SAARC  countries  were  completely  regular.  These journals were either mostly regular or mostly  irregular. The TULSSAA journal of Nepal has published  issues  in  consecutively  irregular  manner.  6.5  Declaration  and  Nature  of  Review  Policy 
The  term  'peer-review'  or  'refereed'  means  a  process  where  the  experts  or  review  boards  in  the  field of expertise examining the journal articles before  acceptance  for  publication.  Although,  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  the  genuiness  of  review  process  as  it  mentioned in their documentation, the study indicates  that,  three  journals  of  India  and  one  journal  of  Sri  Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan each have blind/ double-blind  review  policy.  Otherwise,  most  of  the  journals have mentioned that they follow peer-review  policy to maintain quality of article. The declaration  of  review  policy  is  absent  in  six  Indian  journals. 
156 
6.6  Internationality  of  Editorial  Members  
Regarding  internationally  of  Editorial  Board,  the results indicate that 60 % editorial members of  COLLNET Journal of Scientometric and Information  Management  (hereinafter  COLLNET Journal) and 50  %  members  of Journal  of  Scientometric  Research are from outside India. Otherwise five Indian journals  have up to 20 % international editors and remaining  twelve  journals  do  not  have  any  member  from  outside India. while in the case of remaining SAARC  countries,  one  journal  of  Sri  Lanka  (Sri  Lankan  Journal of Librarianship & Information Management),  Pakistan (Pakistan Journal of Library & Information  Science),  and  Bangladesh  (The Eastern  Librarian)  each  have  international  members  in  their  Editorial  Board.  
6.7  Editor’s  Qualification  
It may be assumed that improper subject expertise  of  editors  leads  to  imbalances  in  journal  content  as  editors  focus  on  issues  they  understand  and  omit  papers  on  subjects  that  leave  them  lacking  in  confidence. It is shown in Annexure I that, although  editors  of  all  the  journals  of  SAARC  countries  are  from LIS discipline, their expertise is non-measurable.  Additionally,  the  calculated  h-index   is  unavailable  of  these  editors  as  their  publication  profile  is  yet  to  index  in google  Scholar. 
6.8  Geographic  Diversity  of  Contributors 
If  a  journal  has  international  readership  and  known  internationally,  it  may  have  international  contributors too. The geographic diversity of author  was measured by analysing all articles of 10 randomly  selected  issues  of  the  journal  for  at  least  5  years.  Among selected SAARC journals highest proportion  of  internationality  among  contributors  has  been  observed in Journal of Scientometric Research  (0.5)    followed by COLLNET Journal of Scientometric and  Information Management  (0.3) and  Library Progress  (0.3).  The  geographic  diversity  among  contributors  of other journals of SAARC countries is mentioned  in Annexure-I .  
6.9  Journal  Structure 
Almost all LIS journals of India and other SAARC  countries mention the scope, coverage, and author  guidelines in their journal. On the other hand, of the  total 20 journals, 9 journals of India and 4 journals  of rest of the SAARC countries do not mention any  standard reference pattern that author need to follow  while submitting articles. It is important to note that  no journal has yet mentioned the publication ethics  they  follow  while  publishing  article.  In  fact  such  practice  may  be  common  in  publishing  of  journals  in developing countries. COPE forum and SHERPA/ RoMEO project have an intension to spread publication  ethics  among  editors  and  journal  publishers.

6.10  Structure  of Articles 
  The  study  shows  that  of  the  total  20  selected  journals, all journals’ articles are written in structured  manner, however, 5 journals do not mention keywords  in the article. Keywords are important for understanding  the subject of the document. All present days’ search  engine use to index the keywords and keywords in  article  helps  searcher  to  retrieve  document  easily  and  likely  to  optimising  visibility  of  article. 6.11  Length  of  Paper  and Abstract 
fixed  word  limits  for  the  article  and  abstract  makes  the  author  to  be  focused  on  writing  the  basic  or  main  idea  of  the  conducted  research.  It  increases  clarity  and  helps  the  author  to  explain  the  idea  concisely.  Also  from  the  editors’  point  of  view,  it  is  easy  to  review  short  or  articles  written  in  limited  words.  
6.12  Internationality  of Article 
 As indicated in  Annexure–I, COLLNET Journal  have  highest  internationality  of  article,  followed  by ALIS,  DJLIT   and  Pearl  Journal  of  Library  &  Information  Science.  for  journals  of  the  rest  of  the SAARC countries such internationality is varied  within  a  small  range. 
6.13  Coverage  of  Conventional  Database 
  It  is  expected  that  inadequate  indexing  of  articles in conventional databases is a serious barrier  to  access.  The  results  indicate  that  although  most  of  the  LIS  journals  of  SAARC  regions  are  indexed  either  in  LISA  or  LISTA,  except  two  journals,  viz.  ALIS  &   DJLIT,   other  journals  are  yet  to  index  in  SCOPUS  or Web  of  Science.  
6.14  Citation  Value 
  The  citation  value  by  using  google  Scholar  (gS)  was  also  measured.  As  the  coverage  of  gS  of  quite  broad  than  other  databases,  attempts  were  made  to  know  average  citation  received  by  the  journal  for  a  particular  period. DJLIT   have  the  highest  citation  per  article  followed  by  Journal  of  Scientometric  Research   and  ALIS.  The  citation  profile  of  other  Indian  journal  is  like  other  SAARC  countries  which  is  very  nominal  except  Pakistan  Journal  of  Library  and  Information  Science.  
7. DISCUSSIONS AND   CONCLUSION S 
The  intention  of  this  study  was  to  identify  the  strengths and weaknesses of LIS journals of SAARC  countries.  few  notable  points  are:    
ISSN  has  been  found  in  all  LIS  journals  of  SAARC  countries  along  with  eight  journals,  many  of  them  have  separate  ISSN  for  their  web  edition  too.  A  common  question  may  arise  at  this  point  that  can  mere  ISSN  be  considered  as  criteria  of  evaluating journal? In fact, ISSN number only gives  the  recognition  of  the  journals  in  the  International  
Serials  Directory  Database;  probably  it  cannot  be  used  as  the  indicator  of  quality.  
The study indicates that non-profit organisations  and  academic  institutions  are  playing  an  important  role  in  promoting  LIS  scholarly  research  in  the  SAARC  region.  Most  of  these  organisations  are  government-funded and some of them are professional  societies of LIS field in the SAARC region. for the  betterment  of  this  discipline  in  this  region  more  involvement  of  these  organisations  are  the  good  sign  for  the  overall  prospect  of  the  discipline.    
If it can consider that the longevity of a journal  might  have  an  relation  with  the  acceptability  of  the  journal  among  peers,  its  strong  organisational  support  as  well  as  defined  publication  policy,  it  may  be  explained  that  three  Indian  journal  namely  JILA,  ALIS   and  IASLIC  Bulletin   must  have  such  acceptability, support and publication policy. However,  correlating longevity of journal with the promptness  of  publication,  it  has  observed  that  most  of  the  journals  with  long  publication  history  are  irregular  in  publication.  Except ALIS,   DJLIT ,   SERELS   most  of  the  journals  do  not  maintain  the  regularity  in  publication. The possible reasons may be multi-fold,  including professional commitment of the organisation  and  members  of  that  organisation,  lack  of  finance  and  unable  to  cope-up  with  the  changing  need  of  the profession are some other reasons. However, at  this point it is difficult to explain any specific reason.  These may be considered as weakness of the journals. 
Exploring journal’s documentation, it has observed  that 14 out of 20 (70 %) LIS journals of India and 7  out of 8 (85 %) journals other SAARC countries have  international  standard  of  review  policy. Although,  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  how  far  the  review  process  as  mentioned  in  the  journal’s   documentation  is  correct,  it  is  the  bare  expectation  from  a  journal  that it should mention its policy to review the article  before  publishing.  Absence  of  such  information  is  a  serious  phenomenon  for  any  journal.  
One  of  the  common  policies  of  international  databases was observed that they include only those  journals which have geographically diversified editorial  board members. However, of the total twenty Indian  journals, only nine journals have such International  members in Editorial Board. This may be one of the  major reasons for non-inclusion of Indian LIS journals  in  conventional  databases.  further,  inclusion  of  Editorial Board members from same organisation may  be another weakness of such journal as institutional  diversity  among  members  is  considered  as  one  of  the  strengths  of  the  journal.  
Another major drawback of few journals (22 %)  was  absence  of  keywords  in  the  article.  In  some  instances, it was observed that few articles contained  keywords  while  other  articles  of  the  same  journal  and  in  same  issue  did  not.  Digital  Object  Identifier  (DOI)  was  also  absent  in  almost  all  journals  in

SAARC countries (except 4 journals, viz., COLLNET  Journal,  Journal  of  Scientometric  Research,  The  Eastern Librarian, and Bangladesh Journal of Library  & Information Science)  which  may  also  considered  as  a  major  weakness  of  these  journals.  
To include journals in the international databases  like  SCOPUS,  WOS,  journal  should  adopt  online  submission system. However, such option is unavailable  in most of the journals of this region. In this study,  it  was  also  observed  that  no  journal  of  SAARC  region  include  information  relating  to    submission  date, revision in the article. Due to that it is difficult  to  guess  the  time-lag  between  publications.  The  absence  of  information  like  rate  of  acceptance  is  another  important  drawback  of  these  journals.  
The coverage of journals in bibliographic databases  is limited. LISA and LISTA are two major databases  where  journals  are  indexed.  No  journals  of  these  regions  are  yet  to  index  in  WOS   and  SCOPUS  (except  ALIS  &  DJLIT).  This  may  be  because  of  the  fact  that  no  journals  of  this  region  are  yet  to  attain the level of qualifing criteria that international  databases fix for inclusion of the journal in databases.  Due to that, the articles of most of the journals are  not  widely  visible  as  the  average  rate  of  citation  per  article  is  low.  To  gain  wide  visibility,  inclusion  of  journals  in  databases  like  WOS,  SCOPUS  is  essential  which  these  journals  lack.
