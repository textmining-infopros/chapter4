The objective of this study is to highlight the library software awareness with special focus on OPAC  Vs card catalogue among the users of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, IIT Kanpur, and Kashmir  University. The study also highlights the features of LibSys and Virtua software used by the select libraries.  The investigator has used questionnaire as a key tool for collecting the necessary data for the present  study. Although the study covers a number of software packages, but Virtua and LibSys softwares have  been discussed in detail. A wonderful fnding of this study is that the Kashmir University has successfully  installed RFID technology through Virtua; but, the same is yet to take place fully in the select IITs. However,  the majority of users in select IITs are using OPAC, while as the usage of OPAC in Kashmir University is  comparatively lesser. Another fnding of this study is that all the select libraries are still maintaining card  catalogues, though used very less. The present study will be useful to enhance the usage of OPAC in  the select libraries. It will also serve as a tool for other libraries to analyse the features and facilities of  leading indigenous and international software package for selecting the suitable software.

1. InTrODUCTIOn 
Library  automation  is  said  to  have  begun  as  early as 1930s, when punched card equipment was  used  in  library  circulation  and  acquisitions.  Shortly  after  this  breakthrough,  other  technology-related  applications  were  introduced  to  library  procedures.  But,  this  movement  was  very  slow  and  the  most  practical  data  processing  applications  could  be  found  in  library  circulation1.  The  developed  world,  especially, Britain and US had shown a large interest  in  the  early  stage  of  library  automation2.  Later  in  1960s,  computers  made  possible  a  new  era  of  library  automation  systems.  Punched  cards  were  not  completely  removed,  but  their  role  gradually  diminished3.  In  this  direction,  the  landmark  efforts  were  primarily  taken  by  USA,  UK  and  Continental  Europe due to the availability of best infrastructure  in  telecommunication  and  computing  technology.  Library  automation  development  can  be  classified  in three different phases: First phase during 1954- 70;  the  second,  during  1970-90;  and  the  present  from  1990  onwards.  The  hardware  and  software  available  at  those  times  have  influenced  each  of  these  phases4.  
In India, computers in libraries were for the first  time used in 1965 by Indian National Scientific and

Documentation Center (INSDOC) when it computerised  the  author  and  subject  indexes  of  ‘Indian  Science  Abstract’.  Shortly  after  two  years,  INSDOC  (now  NISCAIR–National Institute of Science Communication  and  Information  Resources)  brought  out  ‘Roster  of  Indian Scientific and Technical Translators’ with the  aid of computers5. However being developing country,  the  major  development  towards  library  automation  took place with the declining hardware prices, easy  availability of software packages and ever-increasing  interest among library professionals. Consequently, a  number of software packages like LibSys; Granthalaya;  Maitreyi; Sanjay; SOUL; Suchika; DELMS; DELDOS;  TLMS;  LIBMAN;  OASIS;  Delsis;  Libman;  Librarian;  Libris; Library Manager; Library Management; Loan  Soft; Salim; Slim 1.1; Trishna; Tulib; Ulysis; Wilisys,  etc., were developed in India6. However because of  their continuous development for upgraded versions,  SOUL and LibSys are popularly used in India. These  software also fulfill the international standards to a  large  extent.  Nevertheless,  many  large  libraries  of  India  are  presently  using  some  foreign  softwares’  like  Alice  for  Windows,  Virtua,  Techlib  Plus,  etc.,  to  enhance  the  standard  of  their  operations  and  services.  Notably,  the  trend  towards  using  foreign  software  particularly  Virtua  is  increasing  among  Indian  libraries.

A  number  of  studies  have  been  carried  out  in  this direction. However, in India, the library software  awareness  is  poor  with  a  tiny  silver  percentage  of  users  aware  about  it.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  study  was  done  in  this  regard. 
The work of Saffady7  highlighted the development  of an automated circulation; acquisition; cataloguing;  reference services and prewritten circulation software.  Though online catalogues are not still widely popular,  but  a  number  of  libraries  have  implemented  such  systems  on  an  in-house  or  Turnkey  basis.  He  revealed  that  some  operations  were  automated  and  paved  way  for  integrated  systems.  Another  study8   revealed  that  librarians  should  be  aware  that  along  with  the  advantages,  automation  comes  with  a  new  set  of  challenges  also.  Therefore,  it  becomes imperative to keep the users familiar with  computerisation,  before  the  selection  of  software.  The study by Reynolds9  revealed that OPAC merely  identified  the  item,  but  does  not  help  in  identifying  these  items  on  the  shelves.  He  also  revealed  that  earlier  in-house  operations  were  abandoned;  however,  circulation  system  survived.  He  pointed  out  that  automation  has  rapidly  changed  from  early  technical  support  system  to  online  technical  support  system. yet  another  study10   revealed  that  library  software  particularly  online  catalogues  will  provide  access  to  all  resources  wherever  they  are,  but  it  is  essential  that  the  system  must  be  easy  to  use  as  many  users  will  be  unfamiliar  with  computerisation.  Kreslins11,  et  al .  mentioned  that  though recent OPACs like OKAPI offer keyword and  subject  searching  by  using  Boolean  operators,  but  they do not have any standards for use of partially  or  fully  controlled  vocabularies  in  OPACs.  It  also  opined  that  integrated  software  should  be  used  in  libraries.  Ali12   stated  that  LibSys  and  LIBRIS  proved good for Indian libraries, as they need lesser  expertise  and  are  more  user-friendly.  However,  majority  of  Indian  users  are  still  unfamiliar  with  the  advantages  of  automation.  Garcha  &  Butler13 discussed the characteristics of three African libraries  with main emphasis on technological capabilities. It  revealed the paucity of funds and unfamiliarity with  the  technical  understanding  as  the  two  pressing  problems for implementing automated library system.  The study of McCallum14  stated that the remarkable  increase  in  the  use  of  online  catalogs  and  the  increased  interest  in  retrospective  conversion  of  bibliographic records resulted in many retrospective  conversion projects and creation of union catalogs.  The  inexperienced  staff  and  outdated  software  are  the  major  problems  in  automating   Indian  libraries.  Satyanarayana15   suggested  CDS/SIS  system  for  computerising  any  type  of  library  which  is  not  a  standard  package  now-a-days.  Alam  &  Amita16 
326 
surveyed the awareness and use of library software;  however, it was limited to the use of OPACs of five  noted  libraries  of  Delhi.  It  also  revealed  that  users  are  still  unfamiliar  to  handle  the  complex  searches  in OPAC. Tseng & Kuo17  revealed that unfamiliarity  in  operating  the  automated  system  is  the  major  difficulty  faced  by  the  library  patrons.  It  is  hoped  that  this  study  will  fulfill  the  gap  in  the  available  literature  on  the  said  topic  in  India. 
3. SCOPe  & ObjeCTIVeS 
Presently,  a  large  number  of  indigenous  and  foreign library softwares are used by Indian libraries  for  their  automation.  Among  them  LibSys;  SOUL;  Granthalaya;  Maitreyi;  Sanjay;  Suchika;  etc.  are  notable  to  mention.  However,  LibSys  and  SOUL  are widely used library software by Indian libraries.  Mostly, these softwares were developed by Research  and Development (R&D) institutes. In case of foreign  software,  Alice  for  Windows;  Virtua;  Techlib  Plus;  etc.,  are  used  by  many  Indian  libraries.  For  this  study one widely used indigenous and one popular  overseas  software,  i.e.,  LibSys  and  Virtua  were  selected. Both these software are integrated library  management systems and consist of various modules.  Furthermore,  the  scope  of  this  study  is  limited  to  the  central  libraries  of  IIT  Delhi,  IIT  Kanpur,  and  Allama  Iqbal  Library,  Kashmir  University. 
The  present  study  was  conducted  with  the  purpose  to  assess  the  library  software  awareness  among the users of selected libraries, special focus  was  on  following  core  objectives:  
•  Highlight  the  features  of  software  packages  
used  by  the  select  libraries;  
•  Determine the users awareness of their respective  
library  software; 
•  Find  out  the  extent  of  use  of  OPAC  by  the  
users  of  these  libraries; 
•  Evaluate  the  usage  of  OPAC  Vs  card  
catalogue.  
The  hypothesis  was  that  there  is  a  significant  diffrence in the awareness of library software among  the  users  of  IITs  and  Kashmir  University.  
4. MeThODOLOgy ADOPTeD 
Since  the  library  software  awareness  and  the  usage  of  OPAC  Vs  card  catalogue  in  the  select  libraries revolve around human subjects, hence survey  method was adopted for the present work. In survey  research, there are three commonly used techniques  for gathering the data–the questionnaire, interview,  and observation. Questionnaires are considered the  single  most  popular  data  collection  tools  in  any  survey  research.  Therefore,  questionnaire  is  the  key important tool used for collecting the necessary  data. All the select libraries were personally visited  and  users  were  directly  approached.

Significantly,  care  has  been  taken  to  have  a  representative sample of total population of students,  though the random sampling technique was adopted.  A  total  of  527  questionnaires  were  administered  for  a  population  of  5269  users  comprising  3900  students,  948  research  scholars,  and  421  faculty  members in the month of October 2012 among the  users  of  Central  Library,  IIT  Delhi.  Similarly,  315  questionnaires  were  administered  for  a  population  of  3143  users  comprising  2028  students  and  758  research scholars and 357 faculty members of P.K.  Kelkar Library, IIT Kanpur in the month of November,  2012.  In  case  of  Kashmir  University,  a  total  of  555  questionnaires  were  administered  in  the  month  of  November,  2012  for  a  population  of  5550  users  comprising  4750  students,  400  research  scholars  and  400  faculty  members.  The  ultimate  response  rate  (Table  1)  from  the  library  users  of  IIT  Delhi,  IIT  Kanpur  and  Kashmir  University  is  found  to  be  89.75  %,  92.38  %  and  90.63  %  respectively.

The  data  obtained  through  questionnaires  has  been  cross-checked  by  the  data  obtained  through  interview  and  observation.  Finally,  the  data  have  been organised, analysed, compared, consolidated,  tabulated, and interpreted by using tables, percentages  and  statistical  techniques.  The  software  package  MS-Excel  and  Chi-Square  statistical  tests  have  been  used  to  verify  the  validity  of  results.  In  the  light of data, useful findings, recommendations and  conclusions  have  been  derived. 
5. SOFTwAre  PACKAge  In  USe 
The  Central  Library,  IIT  Delhi  has  been  using  LibSys  software  since  1999;  however,  in  2007  it  shifted from LibSys4 to LSPremia version to enhance  its functions and services IIT Delhi18.  Recently,  the  library has switched over to LibSys7 version which  contains  advanced  features  and  supports  RFID  compatibility. On the other hand, P.K. Kelkar Library,  IIT Kanpur began with in-house developed (iit-KLAS)  Kanpur  Library Automation  Software  in  1988. After  using iit-KLAS for nearly two decades, the library in  2007 migrated to presently using LSPremia version  of  LibSys  IIT  Kanpur19.  In  contrast,  Allama  Iqbal  
Library, Kashmir University started with CDS/ISIS in  1997; however, in 2003 the library migrated to SOUL  (Software  for  University  Library)  software.  Due  to  the unsettled shortcomings of UNICODE support to  deal with the large number of bi-directional resources  and lack of RFID compatibility in SOUL, the library  in  2008  switched  over  to  Virtua  software  of  VTLS  Company  to  overcome  these  drawbacks20. 5.1 Description  of  Software 
The  LibSys  software  is  developed  by  Info  Consultants Private Limited (now LIBSyS Ltd.) with  its headquarters in Gurgaon. It is an integrated multi- user library management system designed to run on  different hardware/software platforms in client-server  architecture.  LibSys  is  easy  to  operate  and  does  not require in-depth programming/computer skills. It  produces high productivity as it requires nominal data  entry, maximum possible integration of operations and  powerful  search  and  query  facilities.  The  software

is built around its centralised bibliographic database  based  on  Z39.50  format.  LibSys  performs  almost  all  activities  related  to  acquisition;  cataloguing;  circulation;  and  serials.  Besides  above,  it  has  a  powerful and user-friendly OPAC. Being indigenous, LibSys is widely used across the nation having more  than  1000  Indian  libraries  as  its  clients.  It  is  also  used  in  some  adjacent  countries  like  Nepal,  Sri  Lanka  and  overseas  country  like  Costa  Rica,  etc.  The continuous development of LibSys popularised  it  as  a  standard  library  management  package  for  Indian  libraries.  With  constant  progress,  LibSys  has  produced  LibSys  suite  comprising  different  products like LSEase; LibSys7; LSPremia; LibSysX  and LSDigital LibSys21. Nevertheless, the select IIT  libraries  are  presently  using  LSPremia  version  as  stated  above.  
Virtua software is developed by Virginia Technology  Library  Solutions  (VTLS)  Inc;  the  leading  library  automation vendor at Blacksburg, USA. It is a fully  integrated library management package acknowledged  internationally to deal with the wide range of library  functions. Virtua provides web OPAC and Chameleon  iportal  that  facilitate  the  patrons  to  interact  with

the library by letting them to share what they have  found  on  social  network  sites  such  as  Facebook  and  Twitter,  etc.  Virtua  is  the  first  software  that  fully  supports  FRBR  (Functional  Requirement  for  Bibliographic Records) and RDA (Resource Description  and  Access)  standards.  The  software  is  based  on  six  technologies  such  as  Relational  Database  Management System (RDBMS); Rapid development  tools; three tier Client-Server architecture; database  warehousing;  UNICODE  support  and ATM  network  optimised applications22. These technologies help in  database management handling, software development  and  network  delivery.  Virtua  is  used  by  over  1800  libraries  across  42  countries.  In  India,  nearly  40  libraries including National Library, Kolkata; Jawaharlal  Nehru  University,  New  Delhi;  Central  Institute  of  Indian Languages, Mysore; University of Hyderabad;  Kashmir  University;  IIT  Madras;  Indian  Institute  of  Management  (IIM),  Indore;  Indian  institute  of  Science  Education  &  Research  (IISER),  Kolkata;  Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi; Indian  Institute  of  Management  (IIM),  Bangalore;  Indian  Institute of Technology (IIT), Bhubaneswar; etc., are

AHMAD: LIBRARy SOFTWARE  A WARENESS 
The  finalised  data  have  been  categorised  into  two  groups; the library software awareness and the  usage  of  OPAC  Vs  card  catalogue.  The  obtained  data  in  software  awareness  have  been  analysed,  interpreted  and  discussed  in  Table  3. 
The maximum and effective utilisation of library  software’ has a direct relationship of users’ awareness  with them. In this respect, the data obtained in Table 3  reveals  that  91.21  %  students,  94.04  %  research  scholars and 81.48 % faculty members in IIT Delhi  are aware of library software. In comparison, 89.67 %  students,  91.66  %  research  scholars,  and  84  %  faculty members in IIT Kanpur are aware of library  software. Kashmir University lags behind as 80.28 %  students,  82.5  %  research  scholars  and  76.92  %  faculty  members  are  aware  of  library  software. 
Although,  the  users  of  IITs  have  taken  lead  over  the  users  of  Kashmir  University;  however,  it  is  disappointing  to  point  out  that  a  considerable  percentage  of  8.78  %  students,  5.95  %  research  scholars and 18.51 % faculty members in IIT Delhi  are  unaware  of  library  software.  The  situation  is  somewhat  same  in  IIT  Kanpur,  where  10.32  %  students, 8.33 % research scholars and 16 % faculty  members are still unaware of library software. While  as  expectedly  this  category  of  users  in  Kashmir  University  is  higher  as  19.71  %  students,  17.5  %  research  scholars  and  23.07  %  faculty  members  are  still  unaware  of  library  software. 
6.1 Chi-Square  Test 
On  applying  Chi-Square  test  in  Table  3,  it  is  found that the calculated Chi-Square value is 26.95  as  shown  below: 
Observed  frequencies  (O)  of  variable  ‘yes’  are  402 (total of IIT Delhi), 252 (total of IIT Kanpur), and  387  (total  of  Kashmir  University)  in  first  Row.  
Observed  frequencies  (O)  of  variable  ‘No’  are  39 (total of IIT Delhi), 29 (total of IIT Kanpur), and  95  (total  of  Kashmir  University)  in  second  Row.  
Calculation  for  Expected  Frequency  (E):

∑  (387-417)2   =  900/417  =  2.15  =  417 
∑  (39-60)2   =  441/60  =  7.35  =  60 
∑  (29-38)2   =  81/38  =  2.13  =  38 
∑  (95-65)2   =  900/65  =  13.84  =  65

The  Degree  of  Freedom  (which  is  number  of  independent variables present in the observation) i.e.,  df  was  taken  as  2  and  is  calculated  as  follows: 
df=  (row-1)(column-1) 
There  are  two  (2)  rows  in  the  table  and  three  (3) columns of categories (i.e., IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur,  and  Kashmir  University)  in  the  table  3 
So,  df  =  (2-1)(3-1) 
        df  =  1(2)  =  2  
Now, Chi-Square tabulated value with 2 degrees  of  freedom  at  5  %  level  of  significance  is  5.991.  Thus,  the  calculated  Chi-Square  value  is  greater  than  the  Chi-Square  tabulated  value  which  proves  that  there  is  a  significant  difference  in  the  library  software  awareness  among  the  users  of  the  select  institutes. 
Apart from tabular presentation, the investigator  took keen interest to represent the deuced difference  in  graphical  presentation  also  (Fig.  1).

Library  software  have  shifted  the  means  of  searching  and  retrieving  information  from  manual  to  online  methods.  Significantly,  OPAC  has  been  wonderful invention in this direction. Table 4 reveals  that  82.72  %  students,  84.52  %  research  scholars  and  85.18  %  faculty  members  in  IIT  Delhi  use  OPAC  for  searching  and  retrieving  the  information.  The  situation  is  more  or  less  similar  in  IIT  Kanpur,  where 81.52 % students, 83.33 % research scholars  and  84  %  faculty  members  use  OPAC  for  search  and retrieval purpose. In comparison, this category  of  users  in  Kashmir  University  is  relatively  less  as  only  61.53  %  students,  70  %  research  scholars  and  73.07  %  faculty  members  make  use  of  OPAC  for  searching  and  retrieving  the  resources  of  their  interest. 
Table  4  further  reveals  that,  OPAC  has  not  completely  replaced  manual  methods,  as  a  small  percentage of 3.63 % students and 1.19 % research  scholars in IIT Delhi; whereas 2.17 % students and  1.38 % research scholars in IIT Kanpur still search  and retrieve the information manually. Nevertheless,  none  of  the  faculty  members  in  the  both  IITs  use  manual methods. On contrary, 9.61 % students, 5 % 
330 
research  scholars,  and  7.69  %  faculty  members  in  Kashmir  University  still  search  and  retrieve  information  manually.  
It is noteworthy to mention that 13.63 % students,  14.28  %  research  scholars,  and  14.81  %  faculty  members  in  IIT  Delhi  use  both  manual  methods  and  OPAC  for  search  and  retrieval  purpose.  In  comparison, with 16.30 % students, 15.27 % research  scholars,  and  16  %  faculty  members  in  IIT  Kanpur  use  both  the  above  methods.  In  case  of  Kashmir  University,  the  percentage  of  users  using  both  the  above methods is higher as 28.84 % students, 25 %  research  scholars  and  19.23  %  faculty  members  search  and  retrieve  the  library  resources  both  manually  and  through  OPAC.

Both  LibSys  and  Virtua  software  have  their  own advantages and limitations. Virtua is worldwide  accepted to have robust features that are compatible  to all international standards. While as LibSys falls  short  to  support  some  international  standards.  But  

========6========

AHMAD: LIBRARy SOFTWARE  A WARENESS 
like  Virtua,  LibSys  can  be  installed  on  various  operating systems. Virtua inevitably requires Oracle  RDBMS at its back-end. In case of LibSys, RDBMS  is not required. Nonetheless, LibSys has an option  of  SQL  server  or  Oracle  as  back-end  RDBMS.  However,  LSPremia  version  of  LibSys,  presently  used  by  the  select  IIT  libraries  falls  short  in  RFID  compatibility. On the other hand, Virtua fully supports  RFID technology. Significantly, Allama Iqbal Library  has successfully installed RFID technology. Besides  above,  Virtua  is  the  primary  software  in  library  automation  industry  that  is  fully  compatible  with  UNICODE,  FRBR,  and  RDA  standards.  While  as  except  partial  UNICODE,  LibSys  does  not  support  these standards. It now remains up to the librarians’  ability  and  expertise  to  choose  the  software  that  accomplishes the most requirements of their library  effectively  and  efficiently. 
In  view  of  the  fact  that  IITs  are  technologically  more  advanced  than  the  academic  universities,  therefore the users of select IITs have taken a clear  cut lead in library software awareness over the users  of Kashmir University. However, 8.84 % users in IIT  Delhi  and  10.32  %  in  IIT  Kanpur  are  still  unaware  of library software. In contrast, the users of Kashmir  University are expectedly behind as 19.70 % users  are  still  unaware  of  library  software.With  respect  to  OPAC  Vs  card  catalogue,  the  majority  of  users  are  using  OPAC  for  search  and  retrieval  process  and  a  thin  minority  is  using  card  catalogue.  While  as  considerable  number  of  users  are  using  both  the  forms,  i.e.,  OPAC  as  well  as  Card  catalogue.  The  study  revealed  that  majority  of  users  in  all  the select libraries find OPAC less time consuming  and  user-friendly  in  comparison  to  card  catalogue.  However,  when  this  investigator  elucidated  the  opinion of some card catalogue users, they revealed  that  since  they  are  used  to  it,  therefore  they  have  been carrying on using card catalogue. Some users  also  revealed  that  there  is  no  crowd  around  the  trays  of  card  catalogue;  thus  they  directly  go  to  use  these  trays.  On  contrary,  OPAC  terminals  are  more  often  busy  and  users  need  to  wait  for  their  turn.  Significantly,  this  category  belongs  to  users  who  are  short  of  time. 
All  the  surveyed  libraries  are  still  maintaining  card  catalogue,  though  in  very  less  use.  This  phenomenon  is  also  witnessed  in  many  libraries  of  other  developing  countries  primarily  due  to  the  erratic  electricity.  It  is  notable  to  state  here  that  these  libraries  have  also  revealed  that  sometimes  there  is  a  problem  in  library  software  like  security  of  the  database  or  data  loss,  etc.,  and  during  the  trouble-shooting  they  cannot  shut  the  doors  of  the  library.  Card  catalogue  comes  as  a  rescue  during these emergency situations. Furthermore, the  library  staff  also  showed  apprehensions  regarding  the  loss  of  data  due  to  virus  or  other  problems  
in  the  soft  version  of  the  data.  Therefore,  they  maintain  the  hard  copy  of  data  in  form  of  the  card  catalogue. The results clearly point out that there is  further  improvement  required  on  part  of  the  select  libraries particularly of Allama  Iqbal Library  to take  appropriate  measures  for  enhancing  the  library  software  awareness  and  subsequently  the  usage  of  OPAC.  It  is  also  hoped  that  other  libraries  in  general  will  also  find  this  study  useful  in  selecting  the  appropriate  software  for  enhancing  the  usage  of  OPAC  and  other  operations  and  services  of  their  library.
