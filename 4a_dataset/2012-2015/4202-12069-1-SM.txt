  Electronic  publishing  and  telecommunications  have  enabled  the  library  consortia  to  expand  both  in number and functions over the last decade in India. Thus, several consortia have been developed in  last few years. The present study summarises the consortia system and document delivery services at  Banasthali University under JCCC@UGC-INFONET consortia. The author makes out that the consortia  system  including  document  delivery  services  is  quite  promising.  The  study  also  highlights  some  recommendations for better utilisation of consortia services.

1. IntroDUCtIon 
In the last few years, so many changes have  been  seen  at  different  levels  in  society  with  undeniable impact on the higher education system.  The  rapid  growth  in  information  technology  has  made possible paperless communication through  digital/electronic resources (e-resources). In higher  education system, research work has a significant  role  and  similarly,  scholarly  journals  have  the  foremost  position  of  research  process.  
Academic  libraries,  traditionally,  have  been  building  collections  of  print  journals  to  fulfill  the  academic  and  research  need  but  it  is  not  possible  for  any  library  to  acquire  all  the  required  journals  needed  for  its  users  owing  to  the  continuously  increasing  subscription  cost  of  scholarly  journals.  
In the last decade there has been rapid growth  in the number of e-journals, whose subscription  costs  are  also  beyond  the  reach  of  individual  libraries.  However,  to  fulfill  the  academic  and  research needs of users, the concept and practice  of  resource  sharing  and  consortia  models  have  become  very  useful  to  libraries  in  subscribing  to  e-resources  in  shared  manner.  
The new consortia-based subscription  journals  in  e-format  is  very  popular  among  the  users  because of multi-access, hyperlinks, downloading  and printing, high speed accessibility, quick search  ability  and  many  more,  besides  the  cost  factor.  In  view  of  this,  University  Grant  Commission  (UGC)  forwarded  a  step  ahead  by  initiating  the  UGC-INFONET  e-journals  consortium,  which  is  a  landmark  in  higher  education  in  India. 
2. E-JoUrnAlS   Con SortIA:  UGC-InFonEt    
An e-journals consortia is a system of cooperation  and  coordination  among  the  libraries  which  come  together to share journals electronically. The UGC- INFONET  Digital  Library  Consortium  was  formally  launched  in  December  2003.  UGC-INFONET  is  an  ambitious  programme  of  UGC  to  interlink  all  the  universities  in  the  country  with  state-of-art  technology. The network is being switched to BSNL   w.e.f. 1 April 2010 and renamed as UGC-INFONET  2.0.  The  UGC-INFONET  mainly  provides  internet  bandwidth. The scheme has now been extended to  294  universities.  From  1  January  2011,  the  BSNL  2.0 connectivity has been withdrawn and the entire  services  have  been  switched  over  to  NME-ICT/ NKN  network.  Now,  58  universities  shifted  under  this  connectivity  project.

So many studies have been carried out regarding  document  supplies  among  libraries.  The  main  purpose of Yang’s study1 was to describe document  delivery  services  between  Texas  A&M  University  Libraries  (TAMUL)  and  Texas  A&M  University  at  Qatar  Library  from  2003  to  2008.  It  was  found  that  document  delivery  was  a  popular,  accurate,  prompt  and  well  appreciated  service  for  students,  faculty,  researchers  and  staff  to  obtain  needed  curriculum and research materials unavailable at A&M  University  Qatar  due  to  space  limitations.  During  the survey period, total 2890 requests processed in  the  form  of  interlibrary  loan  (51.7  %)  and  in-house  document delivery (48.3 %) and there was a steady

increase  of  requests  every  year.  The  main  aim  of  Musoke’s study2   was  to  highlight  the  development  of  document  supply  services  in  Uganda  and  the  role in increasing access to and use of information  resources.  The  findings  of  the  study  showed  that  improved  document  delivery  services  which  have  led  to  increased  access  and  usage  of  information  resources  in  Uganda.  It  was  found  that  majority  of  document  supply  requests  were  from  graduate  students  and  academic  staff  in  a  range  from  800- 1500  annually.  The  print  document  supplied  in  the  past three years indicated decreasing trends due to  the increase in full-text articles’ availability. E-mail,  surface  mail,  and  telephone  services  were  used  as  the  mode  of  request  and  mode  of  delivery. The  study concluded that document delivery will remain  a  key  strategy  in  ensuring  access  to  information  resources.  
Moreno3 described  the  role  of  the  National  Library of Australia in the Australian interlibrary loan  environment, not just in the terms of providing access  to National Library collections through the document  supply  service,  but  also  in  providing  infrastructure  to supported interlibrary loans across Australia. The  findings  revealed  that  providing  access  to  library  collections  was  complex  and  constantly  changing.  Client  expectations  were  increasing  and  libraries  needed  to  change  traditional  practices  to  meet  user needs. The Library was the largest supplier of  interlibrary landing as the past 50 years with demand  increasing  from  8836  interlibrary  loan  requests  in  1960  to  144764  requests  in  1994-95. The  result  of  Desale’s4   showed  that  University  of  Pune  received  161 requests from different universities during June- December  2008  and  similarly  109  requests  were  made  by  the  users  of  the  University  of  Pune.  The  study suggested that document delivery service under  JCCC  should  not  be  free  of  cost  and  to  increase  the  speed  of  the  service  more  documents  should  be  supplied  online.  
The objective of the Jamali’s5 study was to evaluate  the  use  and  costs  of AMIN,  the  interlibrary  service  in  Iran.  The  statistics  collected  from  six  libraries  showed  that  514  items  were  loaned,  of  which  49%  were journals articles and 43% were books. Surface  mail  was  used  maximum  to  deliver  the  requested  documents.  The  average  time  spent  dealing  with  each request was about 7.1 days. Appleyard’s6 study  seeked to provide an overview of recent developments  within the British Library’s document supply service  and  offer  an  insight  into  future  plans.  It  was  found  that  British  Library  Document  Supply  Centre  had  made  tremendous  gains  in  optimising  the  service  in  its  current  guise.  Some  new  services  like  UK  Research  Reserve,  Electronic Theses  Online,  etc.,  were adopted to run alongside the document supply  service.  Kelsall’s7 study  described  the  interlibrary  loan  services  of  Library  &  Archives  Canada.  The  
142 
study  observed  that  there  were  so  many  offers  to  access  to  a  broad  range  of  Canadian  documents  and  also  services  that  support  resource  sharing  in  Canada. Demand for the institution’s traditional ILL  services was declining and its focus was turning to  digital  access. The  number  of  requests  peaked  for  Library & Archives Canada’s interlibrary loan services  in the early 1990s at nearly 1.50 lacs requests per  year, and in 2009 the requests were down to a little  over one-third of the peak volume with almost 0.53  lacs. Singh8 found  that  there  was  an  upward  trend  in  the  usage  of  e-resources  in  Manipur  University.  Total 34302 downloaded showing the 41 % increase  as  compared  to  previous  years.  
Madhusudhan9 showed  that  not  only  current  e-journals  were  required,  but  research  scholars  and  students  needed  to  be  provided  the  use  of  significant  electronic  back  runs  as  well  at  Delhi  University.  There  was  an  ever  increasing  demand  for  subscriptions  of  more  e-journals.  Manalan10  found  that  e-journal  consortia  had  already  come  up  in  India  and  some  others  were  in  the  offing.  Libraries had really understood that consortia based  subscription  was  cost  effective  and  also  avoids  redundant  expenses  and  duplicate  subscriptions.  Kaur’s11  study describes the use of e-resources and  services provided at IIT Delhi. It was found that the  usage of e-journals was increasing due to awareness  among the users about the library e-resources and  services. Bhatt 12  showed the genesis, e-resources  facilities and usage of e-resources available through  UGC-INFONET  consortium.  It  was  observed  that  this consortium was the most important platform for  providing access to a large array of e-resources to  all  academic  universities  and  colleges  in  India.  
Naushad Ali’s13 study  determined  the  extent  to  which research scholars at University of Delhi were  aware  and  made  use  of  e-journals.  The  findings  clearly  revealed  that  more  than  60  %  of  the  users  were  using  e-journals  weekly  for  the  research  purpose.  Keyword  was  the  most  popular  research  method  for  searching  e-journals.  However,  it  was  found  that  slow  downloading  of  Pdf  files  was  the  major  problem  that  would  discourage  users  while  using  e-journals.  
The  findings  of  Chirra’s14 study  showed  that  UGC-INFONET Digital Library Consortium had a very  positive  impact  in  meeting  the  research  needs  of  doctoral students at Goa University. The consortium  had  significantly  enhanced  the  quality  of  research  &  publications,  and  had  created  multidisciplinary  opportunities. 
4. JCCC@I nFonEt 
The  year  2008  witnessed  another  landmark  initiative in the history of higher education in India,  the J-Gate Custom Content for Consortium (JCCC)  which is a virtual library of journal literature created

as  customised  e-journals  access  gateway  and  databases  solution  for  the  UGC-INFONET  Digital  Library  Consortium.  It  acts  as  one-point  access  to  journals  that  are  available  online  and  subscribed  by the consortium as well as 22 university libraries  that  are  designated  as  ‘ILL  Centers  (Inter-library- landing-centers)’.  The  Information  Library  Network  (INFLIBNET)  has  initiated  inter-library  loans  and  document delivery services from the comprehensive  collection of subscribed journals under JCCC@UGC- INFONET. INFLIBNET has designated 22 university  libraries  to  fulfill  ILL  requests  from  the  users,  affiliated to more than 250 universities covered under  UGC. The ILL libraries together subscribe for many  journals  which  are  not  available  through  consortia.  Universities can request for articles from the journal  holdings of those libraries wherever they find useful  articles  in  JCCC  search,  that  are  not  available  in  borrowing library. The following 22 universities were  identified as Document Delivery/ILL Centres by the  INFLIBNET  at  the  time  of  starting  JCCC: 1.  Annamalai  University, Annamalai  Nagar  (Tamil  Nadu) 2.

4.1  JCCC@UGC-InFonEt   at  Banasthali  
University 
The Banasthali Vidyapith (University) established  in 1935 and name ‘Banasthali Vidyapith’ was adopted  
in 1943. The institution was granted the status of a  deemed university in 1983 by the UGC. At present,  it is the only residential campus in the country that  provides  education  to  girls  from  the  pre-primary  stage  up  to  the  Doctoral  level.    The  Banasthali  University was included in the second phase under  UGC-INFONET  Consortia  by  the  INFLIBNET.  4.2  Ill   Centre  at  Banasthali  University  
The INFLIBNET has designated the ILL centres  for providing articles to various universities in India.  A list of core and unique journals subscribed by the  ILL  centres  has  been  compiled  by  the  INFLIBNET.  All  the  university  libraries  in  India  can  request  the  articles from those unique journals as identified by  the INFLIBNET to particular ILL centre. All the ILL  centres  are  supposed  to  deliver  the  articles  either  by  e-mail  or  surface  mail  to  the  other  borrowing  universities. A  portal  of  the  identified  journals  with  ILL  centre,  free  online  journals  is  available  in  form of JCCC. The Banasthali University has been  identified  as  one  of  the  ILL  centre  under  JCCC. A  number  of  135  unique  journals  from  its  collection  have been selected for ILL centre from which other  universities  in  India  can  request  for  the  articles.  The  JCCC  was  launched  by  INFLIBNET  on  23  June  2008  and  the  ILL  centre,  started  working  at  Banasthali  University  in August  2008.

5. ConClUSIonS 
The JCCC@UGC-INFONET has made possible to  access a vast range of research knowledge available  with  the  different  universities  to  the  academics,  researchers  and  students.  It  has  given  a  new  dimension  to  the  university  higher  education  by  providing  a  wide  range  of  e-resources  through  resource sharing. The study shows that the usages  of  online  resources  are  increasing  day  by  day  and  the  findings  of  the  study  show  that  the  users  of  Banasthali  University  are  using  UGC-INFONET  Consortia  services  in  good  manner  as  the  total  downloads increased as compared to last year and  it is expected to be improved in forthcoming years.  The  researchers  now  have  reasons  to  perform  quality research output as most of the peer reviewed  journals  can  be  accessible  through  JCCC. 
Being  a  document  delivery  or  ILL  Centre,  the  performance  of  Banasthali  University  is  excellent.  The turnaround is normally within three working days  from the time of receipt of request. Documents are  delivered  as  a  link  in,  or  as  an  attachment  to,  an  e-mail.  Copies  are  delivered  through  surface  mail  when  article  not  available  online.  It  can  be  said  that  nearly  70  %  of  requests  are  fulfilled  within  48  hours. However, on the matter of requests fulfilled by  other universities, the users of Banasthali University  are  not  too  much  satisfied.  So  many  requests  are  pending  and  this  discourages  the  users’  not  to  make  request  for  articles. 
6.   rEC oMMEnDAtIonS 
The consortia service is started in phase manner  
and the distribution of e-resources is also based  
on  phase  system  but  it  is  suggested  that  all  
the  e-resources  should  be  available  to  each  
member  university:  
•	 Being 	 an 	 IP-based 	 service, 	 sometime 	 the 	 IPs 	 
of  one  university  clash  with  other  university  
and  this  results  in  non  accessibility  of  some  
journals. 
•	 Delivery 	 of 	 articles 	 through 	 surface 	 mail 	 is 	 sent 	 
to  the  respective  university  librarian  instead  of  
request of articles Unfulflled Pending 36 81 67 90 53 53 156 224

the  user  directly.  It  may  be  reason  of  delay  
or  non-delivery  of  document  to  users.  It  is  
suggested  to  make  a  provision  to  deliver  the  
articles  to  users’  residential  address. 
•	 There 	 should 	 be 	 some 	 incentive 	 scheme 	 for 	 
document delivery centres to enhance the speed  
of  services.
