ABSTRACT 
Academic libraries are confronted with the challenges of change. The aim of the present study is to  investigate the prevalent scenario and status of university libraries (Central and State) in Uttar Pradesh in  terms of collection, budget, manpower, and a special reference to ICT infrastructure. For the purpose of  this study questionnaire is used as the tool to collect data from university libraries. It highlights different  facets of libraries in the state only. The study reveals that libraries do not have proper infrastructure. The  study is restricted to a limited number of university libraries in the state. Findings of the study will facilitate  the authorities to take appropriate measures in improving the condition of the libraries in the State. 
Keywords: Library, academic libraries, university library, higher education, Uttar Pradesh 
1.    InTRodUCTIon 
Libraries  are  an  integral  part  of  educational  setup.The main function of the library is to educate.  University  libraries  have  their  important  place  in  academic  and  higher  learning  world.  But,  on  the  grass  root  level,  very  less  effort  are  witnessed  in  the direction of integrating library services with the  academic programmes offered by the universities. It is  now more than six decades that the process of library  automation started in the country. But the condition  in Uttar Pradesh (UP) regarding the transformation of  libraries is not very enthusiastic. At present, there is  stagnation and decline in university libraries in UP. 
2.  LIBRARIES In  UTTAR   P RAdESh 
Uttar Pradesh is one of the important states of  India having 75 districts. Allahabad University, Banaras  Hindu  University,  and  Aligarh  Muslim  University  are  among  the  oldest  Indian  universities  which  are  located  in  the  State.  Allahabad  University  is  considered as the oldest university of UP established  in  1887.  Presently  there  are  22  state  universities  (these consist of 12 state universities, 3 agricultural  universities,  1  open  university,  1  law  university,  1  medical university, 1 university for physically challenged,  2  technical  universities  and  1  Urdu  university),  4  central universities, 10 deemed universities and 16  private  universities. The  tradition  of  libraries  in  the  state  is  as  old  as  its  universities.  Most  of  these  universities have libraries since their inception. The  present survey is an attempt to present the picture  
Received 27 May 2015, online published 28 July 2015 
of  libraries  in  such  a  vast  and  centrally  located  state  of  India. 
3.    LITERATURE   R EvIEw 
Nyamboga & Kemparaju1 conducted a research  on  6  university  libraries  in  Karnataka  (India),  and  concluded that these libraries still lag behind some  other Indian universities in the application of information  technology (IT), but the introduction of internet access  is  an  important  step  forward.  They  suggested  that  with  basic  IT  literacy,  library  users  and  staff  are  able to retrieve more up-to-date information, thereby  increasing  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  academic  libraries  as  well  as  helping  to  bring  the  whole  institution  into  the  information  age.  Suku  &  Pillai2  discussed the present scenario of automation  activities in university libraries in Kerala. The survey  findings  mainly  covered  various  aspects  of  library  automation such as information technology infrastructure,  in-house  activities,  information  services  and  their  usage,  manpower  development,  and  budget.  The  paper  described  the  role  of  INFLIBNET  Centre  in  accelerating  the  automation  activities  of  university  libraries,  especially  in  the  context  of  the  UG. 
Raza & Nath3  measured the use of information  technology–the use of hardware and software facilities–in  the university libraries of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh  and  Chandigarh  (India)  with  an  ulterior  objective  to  establish  some  co-relation  between  quality  in  libraries  and  use  of  information  technology. 
Bansode  &  Periera4   conducted  a  study  on  23  college  libraries  in  Goa,  India.  Four  of  these  were

fully  automated,  five  were  partially  automated  and  14  were  in  the  early  stages  of  library  automation.  The  results  showed  that  majority  of  the  libraries  lack  the  staff  required  for  automation.  Traditional  barriers  such  as  insufficient  funds,  lack  of  trained  staff,  and  lack  of  space  were  faced  by  a  majority  of  the  libraries. 
Amritpal Kaur5  presented the impact of e-journals  on university libraries of India interms of resources,  staffing,  space,  technical  services  and  equipment.  The study revealed that the e-journals have impacted  on subscription, infrastructure, staff, space, technical  services, photocopying, inter-library loan, library use  and  reference  services. 
Husain  &    Nazim6   explored  of  the  potential  utilisation of different information and communication  technologies (ICT) in Indian academic libraries. The  study  covered  30  central  universities  of  India.  The  main  findings  are  that  academic  libraries  in  India  have  mostly  been  involved  in  applying  traditional  ICT-based solutions for the management of various  library functions and services, particularly for organising  and  retrieving  information.

Generally, the structure in UP university libraries   consists of one central library and some universities  having  departmental  libraries  also. 
6.1  Information About  the  Libraries 
All  the  11  university  libraries  under  study  have  their  own  building. The  building  is  generally  multi- storied  ranging  from  2-4  stories.  Many  libraries  also  have  other  departments  in  the  same  building.  Some libraries have library and information science  department in the same building. Most of the libraries  have  sufficient  space  in  the  building  but  have  not  been properly planned. The seating capacity in the  library  range  from  80  to  1400  users.  The  budget  varies  from  20  lakh  to  6  Crore  20  Lakh.  Most  of  the  libraries  under  study  have  provided  total  
universities, technological universities and medical  
universities  are  not  covered  in  this  study. 
•	 Data 	 related 	 to 	 collection, 	 budget 	 and 	 infrastructure 	 
are  not  given  in  detail  by  many  universities. 
5.    METhodoLogy 
Questionnaires were distributed to 16 university  libraries  of  UP.  Only  11  filled  questionnaires  were  received  back.  The  response  rate  is  68.75  %.  So  the  final  sample  size  for  the  study  is  11  university  libraries  of  UP. The  present  study  covers  2  central  and  9  state  university  libraries  of  UP.

budget  but  not  the  breakups  of  budget  regarding  expenditure  on  staff,  IT,  print  or  digital  resources  (Fig.1).  Table  1  shows  that  out  of  11  universities  6  are  not  participating  in  any  co-operative  venture  such  as  library  networks,  etc.  
6.2.  ICT  Tools 
Table 2 presents the type of ICT used by the libraries.  It  was  observed  that    out  of  11  universities  only  6  libraries  have  their  own  e-mail  id  others  were  not  
having  an  e-mail  account;  only  2  libraries  have  facebook presence others were not having facebook  presence;  and  1  library  (BHU)    has  its  blog  others  were  not  using  blog.  Out  of  11  universities  only  4  libraries have their own websites and others are using  the university website. Only 3 libraries have full Wi-Fi  campus, 4 partial Wi-Fi and 4 have no Wi-Fi facility. 
      Table  3  depicts  the  varoius  IT  infrastructure  for  users  and  staff.  It  seems  that  most  of  the  universities  do  not  have  good  infrastructure  in  this

and  other  libraries  do  not  have  any  printers  for  users  and  no  library  has  scanner  for  users.  The  computers with internet connection for users range  from  7  to  400.  Some  libraries  have  RFID  while  most  other  libraries  do  not  have  RFID  and  others  just have internet connectivity. There seems a wide  gap  between  the  IT  infrastructure  available  in  the  university  libraries  of  UP. 
Some libraries have three servers. Many libraries  do  not have their own server. Equipments available  in  the  library  are  generally  to  be  used  by  the  staff  not  by  the  users  directly. 
6.3  User  Services  and  Facilities 
Table  4  presents  the  status  of  all  11  university  libraries showing the user services and facilities that  are being provided in these libraries. Generally the  universities are providing traditional kind of services  like  circulation,  reprographic/photocopying  service,  reference,  etc.  OPAC  and  Web  OPAC  are  only  available  in  50  %  libraries.  Only  one  library  (BHU)  is  using  SMS  alerts  for  circulation.  Same  is  the  condition  with  translation  service  only  one  library  (BHU) is providing translation service. Similarly, only  four libraries are providing ILL service. The finding  matches  with  the  study  conducted  by  Husain  &

Table 5 reflects that print collection still dominates  in  this  digital  age.  The  printed  books  range  from  37,978  to  9,  71,962.  Old  libraries  like  BHU  have  large collection of print material but new libraries like  BBAU  has  low  collection  (as  collection  grows  with  time).  Only  3  libraries  have  manuscript  collection.  The audio-visual collection is also not very good in  the  libraries  of  the  State.  Six  libraries  don’t  have  any  audio-video  material  in  their  collection. Table  5  reflects  that  the  status  of  digital  contents

No  libraries  have newspapers and magazines in digital format in  spite  of  the  fact  they  are  available  free  also.  This  may be due to lack of awareness and qualified staff.  Old university like BHU has better digital collection  as  compared  to  other  libraries  in  the  State. 6.5  Membership

lacks  interest  and  initiative  in  filling  the  vacant  posts. In some cases suitable candidates were not  found  for  senior  position  in  the  libraries.  Table  8  shows  the  status  of  subordinate  staff.  The  para- professional  staff  is  known  by  different  names  in  different  universities  as  library  assistant  (BBAU&  BHU),  book  lifter  (BU),  data  entry  operator,  library  assistant,  junior  library  assistant  and  library  clerk  (LU).  Many  libraries  do  not  have  sanctioned  post  for support staff they have them on temporary basis  as  per  requirements.

9.  ConCLUSI onS 
Libraries are undergoing transformation, but the  results of the present study indicate that university  libraries in UP have a long way to go. The libraries  need  to  respond  to  the  growing  and  diversifying  information  needs  of  the  end-users.  There  is  the  need to revamp the situation of these libraries and  provide services according to the changing behaviour  of  the  users.  It  is  true  that  the  infrastructure  and  administrative support are limitations for the libraries  and  it  has  been  observed  that  the  libraries  of  U.P.  need  to  build  a  good  ICT  infrastructure.  There  are  many  challenges  ahead  which  can  be  overcome  with  the  right  skills,  right  attitudes  and  initiatives  by  library  professionals  and  government  as  well.
