ABSTRACT
Microbicides are compounds currently under development that would be applied topically to the vagina
or rectum and would have the ability to prevent the sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) that causes acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome. The study aims to explore the progress and foresight
in microbicides development using research papers’ analysis. The 317 records were downloaded from the
PubMed with the search strategy: (i) “Microbicide [ti]” and (ii) “HIV prevention[ti] + methods[ti] + women[ti]”
till November 2010. Majority of the papers (280, 88.33 %) appeared during the recent decade (2001-2010).
Of the 133 publishing journals, only four journals, viz., Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Antimicrob Agents
and Chemotherapy, Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, and AIDS contributed one-fourths
(80 papers, 25.24 %) of the total papers published by researchers from 22 countries with US on the top of
the tally. The recent decade has witnessed considerable growth in research output in this field while a
successful microbicide still remains elusive. Leading countries in terms of research output like the USA, UK,
South Africa, and India are those often directly affected by HIV. An international journal of microbicides R&D
may emerge shortly to take care of the growing research in microbicides.

1. INTRODUCTION
Microbicides are compounds currently under
development that would be applied topically to the vagina
or rectum and would have the ability to prevent the sexual
transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [that
causes acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS)]
and possibly other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
An HIV prevention strategy that women can initiate or
control in the form of a microbicide was first proposed by
Stein1 almost two decades ago. Since then several
candidate microbicides have entered effectiveness trials
prevention to assess their impact on the prevention of HIV
infection and it may take many years before a safe and
effective product is ready for distribution. The excellent
document of the US-based Alliance for Microbicide
Development2 entitled “Mapping the Microbicide Effort”
provides an exhaustive report on microbicides
development till 2006 by more than 30 leading microbicide
research, development and advocacy organisations. In an
editorial published recently, Abdool Karim & Baxter3
discusses briefly the developments in microbicides
development spanning of almost two decades.

Mapping of research papers from a premier
biomedical database like the PubMed therefore offers an
important scientometric tool to present the current trend
in a growing area of biomedical field like the microbicides
development. As the microbicides research is a relatively
new field, the purpose of this pilot study is to explore the
progress and foresight in microbicides development using
research papers’ analysis.

2. METHODOLOGY
Specifically, records were downloaded from the
PubMed4 with the search strategy, (i) “Microbicide [ti]” and
(ii) “HIV prevention [ti] + methods [ti] + women[ti] “. Total
395 records were saved as Medline records in text (.txt)
format on November 16, 2010. Of these, 317 records
complete in all fields/respects were processed for
analysis in the present analysis. Records with publication
type as news, newspaper article, letter, interview,
editorial, comment and addresses were excluded, leaving
only journal articles and reviews for the present analysis.
Broadly, the analysis included the publishing journals of
the papers analysed, number of authors/paper as also

publishing journals, language of papers, and Thomson’s
Reuters impact factor of publishing journals from the
Journal Citation Reports 20095.

3. RESULTS
Of the 317 papers, 293 (92.43 %) were journal articles
and the remaining 24 (7.57 %) reviews, published during
1952–2010. Majority of the papers (280, 88.33 %)
appeared during the recent decade only (2001-2010)
(Table 1).

Table 2 lists 133 publishing journals used for 317
papers with research output during 1952-2010 in the
descending order. Only four journals viz., Sexually
Transmitted Diseases (32 papers, IF=2.579), Antimicrob
Agents and Chemotherapy (19, IF=4.802), Journal of
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes (16, IF= 4.207)
and AIDS (13, IF= 4.909) together contributed around
one-fourths (80 papers, 25.24 %) of the total 317 papers,
as also 24 publishing journals for 111 papers and another
105 journals for 126 papers. To put it simply, 20.05 % (28
journals) published 60.25 % (191 papers). Except, AIDS,
the remaining top ranking journals are published from
USA. Table 2 lists the top 28 journals publishing 3 or more
papers on microbicides during 1952-2010.

In the literature output, the applicability of Bradford
law6 was also explored. According to Bradford law, the
analysed journals can be placed into groups that account
for about the same number of articles. The groups are
called Bradford zones (Table 3) the most prolific journals
are in the zone called the Bradford nucleus or the core.
For example, after arranging the given journals from most
to least productive (Table 4) one observes that the top 2
journals produce 50 articles; the next 5 journals produce
49 articles; the next 11 journals produce 67 articles; the
next 30 journals produce 69 articles; and the next top 84
journals produce 84 articles. These five zones contain
roughly the same number of articles. The number of
journals in the five zones is in this proportion:
1:2:5:11:30:84, which is close to the proportion: 2.50 : 2.51:
262

2.52 : 2.53 : 2.54 or 1 : 2.5 : 12.50: 31.25: 78.12. Then
n=2.5 in the general proportion is called the Bradford
multiplier. Then, n=2.5 is the general proportion 1: n: n2:
n3. The applicability of Bradford law is quite close to the
expected results.
The data in Table 4 is plotted on a Bradford graph
(Fig. 1) taking the cumulative number of journals (on a log
scale) on the X-axis and cumulative number of articles on
the Y-axis to test the Bradford law of scattering.

In terms of corresponding author’s affiliation, 22
countries accounted for these papers. However, the
country affiliation of the corresponding author was not
available in 19 papers. Top ranking countries in terms of
number of papers were USA (with198 papers), followed by
UK (23 papers), South Africa (14 papers), India (12
papers), Belgium (7 papers), PR China (6 papers),
Australia, Canada and France (5 papers each),
Netherlands (4 papers), Spain and Thailand (3 papers
each), Italy, Uganda and Tanzania (2 papers each) and
Austria, England, Germany, Kenya, Switzerland, Zambia
and Zimbabwe (1 paper each). Institution-wise break-up of
the top ranking country’s 198 papers from the USA
showed that 72 institutions across the USA contributed
these papers. Only USA with 12 institutions (96 papers,
48.86 %) have published five or more papers during the
study period with University of Washington, Seatle, WA
on the top of the tally with 15 papers (Table 5).
The collaboration pattern in 317 papers showed 30
(9.46 %) as single-authored papers and the rest by multiauthored (with 2 or more authors) with 2 papers having
collaborative/editorial teams. However, there were no
authors in four papers. Barring nine papers (German (4),
French (3) and Italian (2)), all the papers analysed were
published in the English language (307). However, one
paper did not include the language used.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Around 280 (88.33 %) papers appeared during the
recent decade (2001-10) only are on expected lines as
microbicides are currently under R&D. While a
successful microbicide still remains elusive, more and
more microbicides researchers, public health personnel,
communities and advocacy organisations from number of
countries are actively pursuing the global initiative in
developing a safe, effective and accessible microbicide. In
the present study, 133 publishing journals for 317 papers
more or less follow Bradford’s Law of scattering,
describing how the literature of microbicides is scattered
in these 133 journals.
The number of countries from the present 22 is
certainly going to mount in the time to come as also the
US-based institutions. Leading countries in terms of
research output like the USA, UK, South Africa and India
are often those directly affected by HIV. Even the impact
263

of 24 review articles is of maximum benefit to the scientific
and biomedical community as suggested by Ketcham
and Craford7. Beginning from 2006 at Cape Town, South
Africa followed by 2008 meet in New Delhi, India and the
recently the biannual international microbicides
conference was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA
during 22-25 May 2010.

The next in the series will be the Microbicides 2012 at
Sydney, Australia. The authors predict by that time an
international journal of microbicides R&D will emerge on
the scene to take care of the growing number of research
papers .
