ABSTRACT
Agriculture in India, since ancient times, is the most crucial sector for ensuring food and nutritional security,
sustainable development and for the alleviation of poverty. It is the key sector in India for generating employment
opportunities for the vast majority of the population particularly in rural areas. The paper aims to explore the
many facets related to agricultural education, research, training, and libraries in India in order to provide a
historical account on these aspects. The paper discusses in detail the various committees and commissions and
their salient recommendations leading to the expansive growth and development of agricultural education, research,
and libraries in India. Further, the paper also highlights the critical role of the Indian Council of Agricultural
Research in the growth and development of agricultural education, research, extension, and libraries.
Keywords: Agricultural education, agricultural research, ICAR, agricultural libraries, Indian agricultural libraries,

1. INTRODUCTION
In the growth and development of a society, the human
resources certainly play a predominant role. Education is
the single most important factor to develop human
resources of a country. The constitution of India makes
higher education as the responsibility of the centre as well
as of the state. However, the co-ordination, monitoring,
and implementation of the standards in the institutions of
higher education, research, and information support
system are exclusive responsibility of the Centre and its
agencies. In view of the above, to implement all these
rules and regulations in the higher education and research
in Indian institutions, the Government of India, by an Act of
Parliament, established a statutory body in 1956 known
as the University Grants Commission (UGC). The major
objectives of the UGC are to undertake, in consultation
with universities and other similar bodies, to take
essential steps for the encouragement and
synchronisation of higher education in India.
The UGC is also empowered to cater to the financial
requirements, allocation, and disbursement of grants,
recommend measures for improving standards and
ensure the follow-up with the institutions of higher
education in the country. Till early sixties, the UGC was
discharging all these responsibilities for higher

agricultural education and research in India as most of the
institutions were associated to general universities. After
the reorganisation of the Indian Council of Agricultural
Research (ICAR) and the creation of the Department of
Agricultural Research and Education (DARE) under
Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, the
responsibilities for higher agricultural education,
research, extension, and libraries in the entire field of
agricultural sciences including veterinary sciences were
transferred to the ICAR in 19651. Since then, the ICAR has
been playing a catalytic role in the field of education,
research, extension pertaining to all aspects of
agricultural sciences and making India self-reliant,
hunger-free, and food-secure.

2. HISTORY OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION
AND RESEARCH IN INDIA
Agricultural education forms the foundation for the
development of requisite manpower for research,
education, training, and transfer of technology to the field
and extension activities throughout the country. After India
gained its Independence from the British, it has recorded
a considerable progress in the field of agricultural
education and research due to the able leadership and
priority for agriculture2. There are enough historical
evidences, to show that the agricultural education existed
5

in India even during the medieval period. Agriculture as a
discipline was included in the curricula of Nalanda and
Takshila which were one of the most well known ancient
universities of country2. India has always been an
agricultural-based country, where the agriculture
education and research has had a great significance in
the sustainable growth and development of human
resources for the agricultural sector. Subsequently, wellorganised and structured courses in agricultural
education commenced in the beginning of the 20th
century, when six agricultural colleges were established
across country, notably some of these colleges are
College of Agriculture, Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), Lyallpur
(Now in Pakistan), Coimbatore (Tamilnadu), Nagpur and
Pune (Maharashtra) in 1905 and 1907 and Sabour (Bihar)
in 19083.
Thereafter several other colleges were established
throughout the country for agriculture education and
research. These colleges were under the direct control of
the State Departments of Agriculture and Animal
Husbandry and were involved only in teaching activities3.
The establishment of Imperial Agricultural Research
Institute in 1905 at Pusa (Bihar) now famous as Indian
Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) at Delhi since 1936
was a pioneer and a landmark institute in agriculture
education and research in the country. The IARI is the
country’s premier national institute for agricultural
research, education, and extension. It has the status of a
Deemed-to-be-University under the UGC Act of 19564.
After independence, the Government of India appointed an
Education Commission under the Chairmanship of Dr S
Radhakrishan in 1948. Similarly, the Agricultural
University Committee was also established in 1960.
Based on the recommendations of these two
Commissions, the first state agricultural university (SAU)
came into existence at Pant Nagar in Uttar Pradesh in
1960, now in Uttarakhand, on the pattern of the Land
Grants College, USA. This was followed by the
establishment of at least one SAU in each major state of
the country3.

2.1 Agricultural Education and Research
before Independence
The base of the Indian economy despite some
remarkable progress in the field of industry during the
British period even till today remains predominantly on the
agricultural sector. It was estimated that nine out of ten
bread earners in India were engaged in agriculture to earn
their livelihood. Even with the lapse of time, when
industries started developing in India and people in large
number starting seeking employment therein, the number
of people dependent on agriculture did not decrease. This
fact is indicative from Table 1 showing a significant
dependence of Indian population on agriculture before
independence.

Further, with regard to the dependence of the work
force on agriculture before Independence, the words of the
Auxiliary Committee Review are worth mentioning, “The
problem of mass education in British India was
predominately a rural problem. Only 29.9 per cent of the
population of 247 millions lived in towns as compared with
79 per cent in England, 51 per cent in USA, 42.2 per cent
in France and 46.5 per cent in Germany. In British India,
74.4 per cent of the population was dependent on
agriculture”5.
Agricultural education before Independence suffered
from a serious set-back due to political reasons and it
was also a fact that Britishers’, wherever they ruled,
somehow could not develop the agricultural education
system in India. Although the British Government from
time to time set up many Commissions and Committees
for improving the agriculture and agricultural education in
India, yet they could not reach the grass roots level due to
lack of interest in enhancing the agricultural education at
every level, be it school, college, or university6.

2.1.1

Famine Commission Report (1880)

The Famine Commission Report (1880) was the first
report which draws the attention of the Government to the
need of agricultural education and research. After
examining the famine conditions and its impact on the
country, particularly in the rural areas, the Commission
recommended that improved agricultural practices should
be the mainstay for obtaining food security against such
natural disasters. The Commission also recommended
that agricultural laboratories should be established in
each province for any kind of agricultural enquiry,
improvement, and famine relief3.

2.1.2

Dr J.A. Voelcker’s Report on Improvement
of Indian Agriculture (1891)

The need of an agricultural chemist was felt due to the
large tracts of fallow land in the North-West Provinces
(presently in Uttar Pradesh) which were infected with
noxious chemicals, and it was thought that chemical
sciences might aid in reclaiming these lands. In 1889, the
Secretary of State (England) expressed his willingness to
send a competent agricultural chemist, who could make
enquiries on the Indian agriculture and advice upon the
best course to be adapted for:
(a) Applying the agricultural chemistry to Indian
agriculture
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

(b) To effect improvement in the Indian agriculture
Dr John Augustus Voelcker, a Consulting Chemist of
the Royal Agricultural Society of England arrived in India
in 1889 toured all over the country meeting
representatives of all provinces and recorded his
achievements in his famous book entitled, ‘Improvement
of Indian Agriculture’3.

2.1.3

Establishment Of Agricultural Colleges
(1905)

With an annual grant of Rs. 2 million, it was decided
to establish in each important province, an agricultural
college and a research station adequately equipped with
modernised laboratories, class rooms and an agriculture
farm. These were established at Coimbatore (1906),
Kanpur (1906), Lyallpur (1906), Poona (1907), Nagpur
(1907), and Sabour (1908) with a mission to develop
education and research in the areas of agriculture such as
Botany, Chemistry, Entomology, and Agronomy. These
colleges offered diploma/certificate courses in agricultural
sciences. Later the degree level was introduced and
these colleges were affiliated to general universities1.

2.2 Agricultural Education and Research after
Independence
Soon after Independence, an emergent need of
bringing about a rapid increase in food grains production
necessitated a re-examination of the existing pattern of
agricultural education and research in the country. For
achieving quick benefits from new agricultural
technologies, closer linkages between research,
extension, and teaching programmes were considered to
be important. It was also realised that achieving all these
objectives was not possible under the general university
system. Therefore, a network of education, research and
extension was sought to respond to the diverse needs of
different production systems, which concentrated on the
agro-climatic situations and the socio-economic
conditions of the farmers. This location and situation
specificity of agriculture led to the setting up of one
agricultural university in each state of the country3.

2.2.1

University Education Commission (1949)

In 1948-49, the University Education Commission
under the Chairmanship of Dr S. Radhakrishnan
recommended that a system of rural universities be
established to supply skilled persons that would be
needed by the country and to meet the requirements of an
educated citisenship on the pattern of Land Grants
College of USA. The Commission observed, “A new
beginning is desirable, with freedom to create a distinctive
tradition as to purposes, spirit and methods”3. The
Commission in general terms mentioned principal
features of the proposed rural universities. A rural
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

university should include a ring of small residential
undergraduate colleges, with specialised and university
facilities in the centre. While the need for a common core
of liberal education in the basic sciences and social
sciences was recognised, it was stressed that the
curriculum should fit the needs of individual students and
should provide for specialisation and selection of courses
from more than one college. Each rural university should
be autonomous and free to work out in its own way, in
terms of syllabi, curricula, examinations and discharging
all academic works3.

2.2.2

First Joint Indo-American Team (1955)

The first Joint Indo-American team was set up on the
advice of Dr Frank W. Parker, an Adviser to the Ministry of
Food and Agriculture, Government of India. The team had
a total of eight members, five Indian and three Americans.
The Indian members of the team visited the US from
January to March 1955, while the American team
members came to India in July 1955. The team approved
the recommendations of the University Education
Commission that wherever possible, each State should
develop a rural university and initially Uttar Pradesh
(Tarai), West Bengal (Haringhatta), Bihar (Patna), Orissa
(Bubaneshwar), Travancore (Cochin), and Bombay State
(Anand) were identified for establishment of agriculture
universities to cater the requirements of education and
research. They suggested that the Government of India
should start post graduate (PG) teaching IARI and Indian
Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI)3.

2.2.3

Hannah’s Blueprint on Agricultural
Universities (1956)

The work of this team was greatly facilitated by a
blueprint on agricultural universities prepared by the H.W.
Hannah in 1956. On the basis of this blueprint, the Uttar
Pradesh Government submitted a proposal to the
Government of India in September 1956 to establish an
agricultural university at Rudrapur in Tarai, now known as
Pant Nagar. The Government of India agreed to the setting
up of the agricultural university in Tarai only as an
experimental measure in the second Five Year Plan
(1957-1961). However, there were demands from many
more states for such universities, and in 1961 the
Government of India accepted the need for a few more of
these kinds of universities during the third Plan Period
(1962-1967) and suggested that the existing colleges/
institutions, which had strong departments for teaching
and research in agriculture, should serve as the nuclei for
such universities3.

2.2.4

Report of Education Commission (1964-66)

The profound impact that the scheme of agricultural
universities made on policy-makers is evident from the
7

report of the Higher Education Commission (1964-66),
headed by Professor D.S. Kothari, the then Chairman of
UGC. The Commission recommended the establishment
of at least one agricultural university in each state. It
further recommended that all aspects of research on
agriculture should be the concern of the agricultural
universities.
The
implementation
of
these
recommendations further widened the area under the
control of these universities. It further led to the integration
of teaching, research and extension education activities
where it did not exist. The Commission also observed that
an agricultural university provides a better environment for
research than a state department of agriculture3.

2.2.5

Report of Review Committee on Agricultural
Universities (1977-78)

The ICAR set up a Review Committee in January
1977, under the chairmanship of Dr M.S. Swaminathan,
Father of Green Revolution in India. The main objective of
this Review Committee was to review the growth and
development of agricultural universities in India. The
Committee submitted its comprehensive report in June
1978. The Committee’s overall assessment was that the
agricultural universities together had made a tremendous
impact on the agricultural production during the short
span of their existence. The Committee, however, stated
that there was a high degree of variation amongst
agricultural universities in achievement and output, quality
of leadership and competence of faculty, the degree of
institutional development and maturity, the magnitude of
financial support from the state governments, extent of
transfer of research responsibilities to the university,
quality and relevance of teaching and research
programmes, operational efficiency, and commitment to
public service. The quality of leadership, degree of
commitment and support from the State Government had
been identified as the major factors responsible for this
variability in the vertical growth, performance and
potential.

3. PRESENT STATUS OF AGRICULTURAL
EDUCATION AND RESEARCH IN INDIA
The journey of agricultural education and research
started with the establishment of only 17 agricultural
colleges, three veterinary colleges and one agricultural
engineering college in 1950. The National Agricultural
Education System (NAES) under the control of ICAR,
New Delhi is the largest network of agricultural education
and research in the whole world. It comprises of SAUs
and their constituent colleges and the research institutes
partially funded and controlled by ICAR, which impart
education, research and extension in all fields of
agriculture science and technology and their allied fields.
At present there are 210 constituent colleges of 44
SAUs and one central agricultural university (CAU), 5
8

deemed-to-be-universities (DUs), 17 national research
centres (NRC), 50 central research institutes (CRI), 6
national bureaus (NBs), 25 project directorates (PDs) and
78 All India Coordinate Research Projects (AICRP) all
functioning under the control of ICAR7. This can be viewed
from the Table 2. In addition, the Faculty of Education
Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Varanasi; Aligarh
Muslim University (AMU); Aligarh; Shanti Niketan
Kolkatta (WB) about 50 agricultural colleges affiliated to
16 general universities, and 7 Indian Institutes of
Technology (IIT) are also imparting education and
research in agriculture science and technology.

3.1 State-wise Distribution of ICAR’s
Research & Education
The ICAR is the national apex organisation of the
country for imparting graduate to doctoral education in the
entire domain of agricultural sciences and technology. It
consists of a variety of institutions, which are located in
27 states of the country. The entire network of the ICAR
research and educational institutions with their numbers
is shown through the given Table 3.

3.2 Indian Council of Agricultural Research
The Government of India appointed a Royal
Commission on Agriculture in 1926 headed by Lord
Linlithgow (who later on became the Viceroy of India and
served 1936 to 1943) to examine the conditions of
agriculture and rural economy in India. The Commission
recognised the significance of agricultural education and
research and stated that the foundation of all agricultural
progress is only practical and experimental. Therefore,
the Commission proposed that the Imperial Council of
Agricultural Research should be constituted, the primary
function of which would be to promote, guide, and
coordinate agriculture research and education throughout
India. Subsequently, the Royal Commission on
Agriculture decided to setup the Imperial Council of
Agricultural Research by their resolution, Simla dated, 23
May 1929 at Delhi10. The Government of India considered
the recommendations of the Royal Commission and
decided to set up the Imperial Council of Agricultural
Research as a Society registered under the Societies

structure and organisation of present ICAR system is
shown in the Fig. 1.
The DG is assisted by eight Deputy Director General
(DDG) - one each In-charge of Crop Sciences, Natural
Resource Management, Animal Sciences, Agricultural
Education, Agricultural Extension, Fisheries, Horticulture
and Agricultural Engineering. On the administrative side,
the DG is assisted by the Secretary, ICAR, who is also
the Additional Secretary to the DARE. In all financial
matters, the DG is assisted by the Financial Advisor (FA).
The Agricultural Scientists’ Recruitment Board (ASRB) is
an independent recruiting agency of the ICAR for its
Agricultural Research Services (ARS) and equivalent
technical posts as well as also for research management
positions. The Council also has a National Academy of
Agricultural Research Management (NAARM), at
Hyderabad (AP) to provide the requisite training to the
9

new entrants to the Agricultural Research Services
(Agriculturists)8.

3.2.2

Responsibility and Mandate

Agriculture is a state subject and the prime
responsibility for agricultural research, education,
extension education and its development lies with the
States. However, as the apex organisation in the country,
ICAR coordinates the research and extension education.
ICAR has the following mandate as governed by the ICAR
society:
(a) To plan, undertake, aid, promote and co-ordinate
education, research and its application in agriculture,
agro-forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, home
science and allied sciences
(b) To act as a clearing-house of research and general
information relating to agriculture, animal husbandry,
home science and allied sciences and fisheries
matters through its publications and information
systems, as well as instituting and propagating
transfer of technology programme
(c) To provide, undertake and promote consultancy
services in the field of education, research, training
and dissemination of information in agriculture, agroforestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, home science
and allied sciences
(d) To look into the problems pertaining to the broad
spectrum of rural development concerning agriculture

including post-harvest technology by developing cooperative programmes with other organisations, such
as the Indian Council of Social Science Research
(ICSSR), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research
(CSIR), Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC),
Universities, etc11.

3.2.3

Agricultural Education

The imparting of agriculture education and research in
India at the central level is the sole responsibility of the
ICAR. Under the ICAR, the Education Division which is
headed by the Deputy Director General (Education) and five
Assistant Directors General namely, ADG (HRD-I), ADG
(HRD-II), ADG (Education Planning and Development),
ADG (Accreditation), and ADG (Home Science)12. The
Education Division of the ICAR since 1995 onwards
conducts the All India Entrance Examination (AIEEA) for
admission to 15 per cent of the seats reserved in SAUs,
CUs (i.e., AMU, BHU, Biswa Bharti, Nagaland University,
and CAU, Imphal) for UG degree (BSc, BTech., B.F. Sc,
etc.) in agricultural sciences, namely, horticulture,
agriculture engineering, dairy technology, forestry, food
sciences, fishery sciences, home sciences, sericulture,
and agriculture marketing and cooperation12.
In addition to above activities, the Education Division
of the ICAR also looks into the various important activities
for the agriculture education in the country such as
accreditation
for
quality
assurance,
global
competitiveness in human resource development,
distance education for reaching to the un-reached people,

fellowship and scholarships as a tool for human resource
development, women technological empowerment,
faculty competence improvement, and networking for
access to information13. Further, the admission for the fiveyear Bachelor of Veterinary Science and Animal
Husbandry degree is the responsibility of the Veterinary
Council of India. The Veterinary Council of India is a
statutory body of the Government of India framed under an
Act of Parliament, i.e., Indian Veterinary Council Act,
1984 (52 of 1984) with its Headquarters in New Delhi. The
Veterinary Council of India regulates veterinary practices
and veterinary education. Only those who possess
recognised veterinary qualification and registered with the
Council can practice in the country in veterinary13. The
Veterinary Council of India conducts an annual
examination, i.e., All India Common Entrance
Examination (AICEE) for filling up of 15 per cent of the
total undergraduate (i.e., Bachelor of Veterinary Science
and Animal Husbandry) seats of each veterinary college
and university, i.e., Veterinary, Animal and Fishery
Sciences University, Bidar (Karnataka); Tamil Nadu
Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chennai,
(Tamilnadu); West Bengal University of Animal and
Fishery Sciences, Belgachia, Kolkata (West Bengal);
Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University,
Nagpur (Maharashtra); Indian Veterinary Research
Institute, Izatnagar, Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh); National
Dairy Research Institute, Karnal (Haryana); and Central
Institute for Fisheries Education, Versova, Mumbai
(Maharashtra)10.
The Education Division, has three sections: (i) Human
Resource Development; (ii) Education Planning and
Development and (iii) Educational Quality Assurance and
Reforms and headed by the Deputy Director General
(Education) responsible for planning, development,
coordination and quality assurance in higher agricultural
education in the country and keep control in maintaining
and upgrading quality and higher agricultural education
through partnership and efforts SAUs, DUs, CAU and CUs
with agriculture faculty. In addition to, the Division also
has a NAARM for facilitating capacity building of the
National Agricultural Research System (NARS) in
research and education policy, planning and management
and a National Centre for Agricultural Economics and
Policy Research. The Division has many credits in its
name and a few noteworthy are as14:

3.2.4

Agricultural Research

The institutes and centres belonging to the ICAR
assumed responsibility for agricultural research and other
related fields both at the national and regional levels. The
scenario has changed after the establishment of SAUs.
The ICAR has made efforts to reinforce the research
capabilities of the agricultural universities through their
AICRP, the National Agricultural Research Project
(NARP), National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP)
and National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP). As a
result, a large number of the SAU have developed a
remarkably good research infrastructure and scientific
manpower 14.

3.2.5

Agricultural Extension and Technology
Transfer

To make available the latest tools and technology and
awareness and extension in the country to ultimate users
(i.e., farmers), the Agricultural Extension Division of ICAR
is responsible for the assessment, refinement and
demonstration of technology/products through a network
of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK). Under this endeavor,
about 44 Agricultural Technology Information Centres
(ATIC) have been established under the ICAR institutes
and SAUs. There is one National Research Centre for
Women in Agriculture (NRCWA) located in Bhubaneswar
(Orissa). The Division is headed by DDG (Agricultural
Extension) supported by 2 ADG and had many credits
such as9:
•

Established a VSAT-based national network of over
589 KVKs
11

•

Conducted 4189 on-farm trials on 537 technologies to
identify their location specificity under different
farming systems

•

Organised 53,974 frontline demonstrations to
demonstrate the production potential of newly
released production technologies on the farmers’ fields

•

Trained more than 1.0 million farmers and extension
personnel in agriculture and allied fields;

•

Conducted large number of extension activities
benefiting about 4.19 million farmers and other end
users

•

Trained more than 1.0 million farmers and extension
personnel in agriculture and allied fields, and

•

Continued functioning of 44 ATICs in ICAR institutes
and SAUs

3.2.6

Collaborations with Other R&D
Organisations

In its endeavor to implement its research policies and
programmes, the ICAR developed a large network in
discharging its role as a national co-coordinating agency
(NCA) in the field of agriculture education and research.
The ICAR has also established linkages with the Planning
Commission, Department of Science and Technology
(DST), Council of Scientific Industrial Research (CSIR),
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Indian
Council of Social Sciences Research (ICSSR),
Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), and other relevant
agencies on the one hand and International Research
Organisations and Institutes such as Food and
Agricultural Organisation (FAO), United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank (WB),
International Development Agency (IDA), Asian
Development Bank (ADB), etc., on the other. The ICAR
also maintains a regular link with the SAUs and their
research network in the country through the AICRP
through senior scientists as ICAR nominees on the
Management Boards of the SAUs and through the
representatives of the SAU on various ICAR bodies. The
ICAR also maintains a close working relationship with the
UGC and discharges the functions of the UGC with regard
to agricultural universities. The ICAR is also represented
on the boards of numerous related departments such as
the Department of Ocean Development (DOD), Indian
Meteorological Department (IMD), Department of
Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Non-Conventional
Energy Sources (DNES), etc. It is through these linkages
that the ICAR has acquired the possibility of providing
support not only to organisations involved directly in
agricultural research but also to those working in allied
fields, providing superlative means of an integrated
12

functioning of agricultural research, education, and
extension education10.

3.2.7

Agricultural Libraries

Libraries, being a part and parcel of the education
and research system, are playing a vital role. They provide
information support and function as a nerve centre for
research affairs around which the progress of the country
is spiraling high. Their development has been parallel
along with the growth and development of institutions in
particular and the country as a whole in general. Libraries
have served the nation and borne many constraints during
the span of 64 years of independence. Special emphasis
was laid to the development of an agricultural research
infrastructure immediately after Independence. The ICAR
acts as a repository of information and provides
consultancy on agriculture, horticulture, resource
management, animal sciences, agricultural engineering,
fisheries, agricultural extension, agricultural education,
home science, and agricultural communication.
Presently, 44 SAUs libraries and One CAU library, 5 DU
libraries, 17 NRC libraries, 50 CRI libraries, 6 NB libraries,
25 PD libraries and many field stations libraries/KVS
libraries are functioning under the aegis of ICAR.

3.2.8

Committees and Commissions of
Agricultural Libraries

Since the inception of the ICAR system, many
Committees and Commissions have been appointed for
the assessment/improvement of agricultural education
and libraries. The most specific committee which
advocate the various recommendations for the betterment
agricultural libraries in India are15:
(a) 1956–Dr Ralp R Shaw and Dr Krishna Rao Committee
(b) 1957–Dr M.S. Randhawa Committee, which states
“Libraries are a necessary part of the researcher’s
tool. Every possible step should be taken to improve
library facilities which are often inadequate. The
recommendations of this Committee created deep
awareness among librarians and administrators for
better agricultural libraries”
(c) 1968–Dr Dorothy Parket Committee, resulted a
survey, i.e, The Indo American Agricultural Library
Survey and Study Team. The committee gave 69
recommendations for the overhauling the entire
system of agricultural libraries in India. Some
significant were: (i) improvement in the physical
facilities of ICAR institute libraries (ii) strengthening
the collection of books and journals (iii) appointment
of trained librarians in the institutes libraries (iv) status
of library equal to that of a Department of the institute
(v) status of librarian at par with Head of the
department and (vi) making of a National Agricultural
Library in India headed by a Director
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

(d) 1969–Dr Ramaiah Committee, under the
chairmanship of Dr K. Ramaiah, Honorable member of
Parliament, consisting of scientists like Dr M.S.
Swaminathan, Dr C.M. Singh, Dr N.N. Singh, etc., to
review the recommendations of Dr Dorothy Parket
Committee, which accepted a few of out of them
(e) 1973–Regional Agricultural Library Study Team
(f)

1980-2010–several recommendations which came
out from the deliberations and discussions of various
national agricultural conferences/seminars/workshop
being organised at national level by the ICAR, AALDI,
CeRA, and other bodies from time to time

3.2.9

Initiatives in Capacity Building of Agricultural
Resources

Access to digital resources is of paramount
importance to the researchers, academicians, students
and other stockholders. Under the aegis of ICAR, mega
efforts are being made to strengthen digital library, create
open access institutional repositories, providing access
to digital resources, enhancing web presence, e-courses
development and hosting, crop specific knowledge portals
and web services through world bank funded project
known as National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP)
such as:
(a) CeRA (Consortium of Resources in Agriculture):
an
online
agricultural
resources
initiative
commissioned in November 2007. IARI library acts as
nodal agency to subscribe e-resources for the NARS
libraries of ICAR.
(b) e-Granth Consortium: NARS has a very large
collection of repositories in agriculture and allied
sciences, spread all over the country in different
libraries, academic institutions, museums, and in
authors’ collections. This invaluable heritage has to
be documented, preserved and made easily
accessible to end users. Therefore, with the financial
assistance of NAIP, this responsibility was assigned
to IARI as the lead centre and other institutes such as
Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University
(ANGRAU), Hyderabad; Central Institute of Fisheries
Education (CIFE), Mumbai; Ch. Charan Singh
Haryana Agricultural University (CCSHAU), Hisar;
CSK Himachal Pradesh Krishi Vishwavidyalaya
(CSKHPKV), Palampur; GB Pant University of
Agriculture & Technology (GBPUAT), Pantnagar;
ICAR Library, New Delhi; Indian Veterinary Research
Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar; Mahatma Phule Krishi
Vidyapeeth (MPKV), Rahuri; National Dairy Research
Institute (NDRI), Karnal; Tamilnadu Veterinary and
Animal Sciences University, Chennai; and University
of Agricultural Sciences (UAS), Bangalore as copartner for creation of digital repositories of
agricultural education, training and research.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(1)

(c) KrishiPrabha: KrishiPrabha is Indian Agricultural
Doctoral Dissertations Repository of 45 SAUs/DAUs
of NARS which award doctoral degrees in agriculture
and allied disciplines. KrishiPrabha is the first of its
kind in agricultural sciences in India. The Nehru
Library of CCS HAU is the nodal and coordination
agency. It is responsible for data capturing, editing,
indexing, organising, aggregating and other
operations related to the development and
maintenance of the digital repository. ICAR and all
SAUs/DAUs are the stakeholders and can access the
content of doctoral dissertations.

8. CONCLUSIONS
The human resource developed by the national
agricultural research system (NARS) has undoubtedly
has been instrumental in agricultural transformation of the
country. In future, the need for new knowledge and skills
becoming more challenging than ever, it would however;
be hard pressed to keep pace with the rapid
technological, economic and social developments taking
place nationally and internationally. Henceforth,
agricultural education is seen to be required to:
(i)

Respond to the need of employment, food security,
poverty, economic growth and sustenance of the
natural resource quality, and

(ii) Measure up to handling of internal (poverty) and
external pressures of such international organisations
such as FAO, WTA, GATT, GMO, etc.
The re-orientation of agricultural education and its
linkage with trends of employment and needs of various
sectors of economy (public, private, service, import and
export) on one hand and its responsiveness to maintain
environmental integration on the other hand will have to be
the front ranking strategy of the national agricultural
education system. While futuristic quality of agricultural
education and research will depend upon employment,
economic growth and environmental health, it will be
necessary to make sector-wise projections on manpower
demand and plan supply accordingly at the regional and
national levels. Apparently, forging and forcing a match
between the kind and number of graduates and postgraduates churned out by the education system and their
employability vis-à-vis changing market demand will be a
necessity. Placing maximum emphasis on employability
is justified because unemployment is a major cause of
wasted human resource, persistent frustration giving birth
to destructive activities, deceleration of economic growth
and hurt to national pride and international standing.
For the improvement of the status of agricultural
libraries and librarians in the country, the ICAR sincerely
takes
serious
initiatives
to
implement
the
recommendations of the various committees and
commissions. As libraries and labs are tools in the
13

application of agricultural research, education, and
training in order to innovation and new research, it is the
need of hour that ICAR should recruit the LIS
professionals at par with the computer professionals
(scientists). Further, ICAR should also make concerted
efforts to create the higher promotional avenues for LIS
professionals in the NARS from the existing (T-9, which is
equal to Deputy Librarian/Senior Scientist) to University
Librarians/Principal Scientist so that the LIS
professionals should not move to other organisations.
