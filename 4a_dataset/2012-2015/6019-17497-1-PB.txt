  Library  &  Information  Science  has  completed  its  100  years  of  education  in  India.  Research  has  always been regarded as the most important intellectual activity in the higher education system, therefore  this research article aims to provide a comprehensive picture of doctoral research carried out by various  LIS  departments  of  India.  Universities  offering  regular  PhD  programme  were  identifed  using  various  primary/secondary, online/offine sources. A questionnaire was designed for data collection and the same  was sent to the heads and faculty members of LIS departments of these universities by e-mail/in print.  Based on data collected from 81 departments located in 22 states of India, the growth and development  of LIS research in India since the award of frst PhD in 1950 till 2012 is traced.

1. INTRODUcTION  
Research  is  the  most  important  intellectual  activity in the higher education system which provides  dependable solutions to the problems being manifested  in  various  fields  of  knowledge.  Research  brings  prestige not only to the nation and the department/ university  but  also  to  the  research  scholar.  Today  in  this  competitive  world,  no  university  can  afford  to  remain  static,  it  has  to  evolve  continually  and  consciously  by  adding  new  ideas,  inventions  and  discoveries in different fields of knowledge through  research. Research generates new knowledge which  ensures  development  of  a  subject,  and  helps  to  establish  sound  theories  of  the  subject.  Research  is  directly  responsible  for  the  social  and  economic  development of a country. It has been regarded as  a  determinant  force  in  supporting  and  shaping  a  sustainable  future  of  a  nation. According  to  former  President  of  India,  Dr  A.P.J.  Abdul  Kalam1,  "the  importance  of  research  cannot  be  underestimated  today  when  it  has  emerged  as  the  driving  force  in  the  process  of  self-reliance  in  all  cutting-edge  technologies.  In  certain  universities,  research  has  been  the  main  contributor  and  guiding  force  in  realising  its  core  competence".  In  other  words,  research  would  be  a  way  to  harness  and  find  means  to  cater  the  social  and  economic  needs  of  the  world.

2. LIS  EDUcATION:  PRESENT  ScENARIO 
Foundation of LIS education in India dates back  to 1911 when William Alanson Borden (1853-1931),  an  American  disciple  of  Melvil  Dewey  started  a  short-term  training  programme  in  Library  Science  at  Baroda  under  the  patronage  of  Maharaja  Sayaji  Rao Gaekwad II (1862-1939), the Ruler of erstwhile  princely  State  of  Baroda.  This  was  the  first  formal  training  course  in  Library  Science  started  in  India.  Library  and  Information  Science  (LIS)  education  in  India  completed  its  100  years  in  2011.  Now  LIS  education  has  grown  and  developed  into  a  full-fledged discipline. According to Singh2,  various  levels LIS courses offered by university departments,  institutions,  library  associations  and  specialised  institutions  are  as  follows:  
• Certificate  Course 
• Undergraduate  Diploma  Course 
• Postgraduate  Diploma  Course 
• Bachelor  of  Library  and  Information  Science • Master  of  Library  and  Information  Science • Associateship  in  Information  Science 
• MPhil  in  Library  and  Information  Science 
• PhD  in  Library  and  Information  Science  
• DLitt  in  Library  and  Information  Science

As  far  as  LIS  courses  at  university  level  are  concerned, large number of universities are offering  various courses. Data collected from published and  unpublished sources (including questionnaires used  for this study) reveals that over the period of time,  number  of  such  universities  has  grown.  Details  about  the  number  and  level  of  courses  offered  by  these  universities  are  as  follows: 
• 181  universities  are  offering  library  science  
courses  
• 131  are  offering  bachelor’s  degree  course • 136  are  offering  master’s  degree  course  • 41 (out of 136) are offering two-year integrated  
master’s  level  course, 
• 21  are  presently  offering  MPhil  degree,  (19  
departments  started  and  closed) 
• 93 universities (including 10 distance education  
universities)  are  offering  PhD  degree.

LIS  RESEARcH  ScENARIO  UP  TO  1970s Research in Library Science dates back to 1950  
Mr D.B. Krishna Rao’s PhD is regarded as the first  PhD  in  Library  Science  in  India3.  
4. SITUATION  FROM  1980s 
During  1980s,  situation  was  much  improved  as  103  PhDs  were  awarded  at  an  average  rate  of  10.3 PhDs per year which was 151 times higher in  comparison  to  initial  29  years  (1950-1979).  During  1990-1999,  this  number  grew  further  to  395  at  an  average  growth  rate  of  39.5  PhDs  per  year.  next  decade of 2000-2009, proved to be highly productive  as  during  this  decade  there  were  total  804  PhDs  (average  80.4/year)  awarded  by  the  end  of  2009.  However the growth rate was highest during 2010- 2012 as in just within three years, the increase was  highest  at  an  average  rate  of  144  PhDs  per  year.  This  high  rise  in  number  of  PhDs  award  can  be  attributed to many factors like, PhD being a prestigious  qualification and considered suitable for higher jobs,  and majority of the young professionals are getting  interested in doing PhD. Another important factor is  that University Grants commission (UGc) provides  good financial assistance to all the candidates who  
when Manindra Nath Basu was awarded PhD on a  qualify Junior Research fellowship (JRf) exam for  topic, ‘Museum methods and the process of cleaning  conducting PhD. Third factor is emphasis on research  
and preservation’3  from University of  calcutta (from  other than Library Science department). Ranganathan  who was a great visionary, fully realised the role of  research in LIS education so after the establishment  of full-fledged Library Science Department at University  of  Delhi,  he  took  steps  for  initiating  the  research  programme  in  the  Department.  The  process  was  initiated by moving a proposal to university authorities  in 1948 but the formulation of rules and regulations  took nearly 4 years. Ultimately, he accomplished the  mission as Mr D.B. Krishna Rao was registered as  the  first  candidate  in  1952  for  PhD4.  At  that  time,  University  of  Delhi  was  the  only  university  with  a  full-fledged department of library science in the British  Commonwealth to offer the PhD programme in LIS.  
qualification  by  institutions,  universities  and  UGc for  promotion/selection  to  senior  positions  is  also  prompting  the  professionals  to  obtain  PhD  degree  out  of  necessity.  All  these  factors  are  leading  to  continuous  growth  of  PhDs.  
5. ScOPE  
Library and Information Science (LIS) research in  India has completed its 63 years in 2012. therefore,  the  time  is  ripe  enough  to  introspect  how  LIS  education  has  grown  over  the  period  of  time  and  achieved its present status. Therefore, the study aims  to  trace  the  growth  and  development  of  research  activities in India carried out by various regular LIS  departments/schools  of  India.  This  study  covers  
Mr D.B. Krishna Rao worked under the guidance of  the  total  span  period  of  63  years,  starting  from  
Dr  S.R.  Ranganathan  on  a  topic,  ‘facet  Analysis  
1950 when the first PhD was awarded till 2012. All  
and  Depth classification  of  Agriculture’,  and  was  relevant  information  relating  to  each  PhD  awarded  
awarded PhD degree in 19575. However, after a gap  of twenty years, second PhD was awarded in 1977  to  Mr  Pandey  S.K.  Sharma  on  a  topic,  ‘expansion  and  modification  of  DDc………Indian  religion’  from  LIS Department of Panjab University, Chandigarh3.  
Based  on  data  collected  for  this  study,  it  was  found  that  during  1950-76,  7  PhDs  were  awarded  in  library  science  from  other  departments  also  as  only  few  LIS  departments  were  offering  research  facilities.  Due  to  such  situation,  the  process  was  quite  slow  and  total  20  PhDs  were  awarded  (0.68  PhD  per  year)  during  initial  29  years,  i.e.,  up  to  1979,  including  7  PhDs  from  other  than  Library  Science  departments.  Since  PhD  of  Mr  Manindra  Nath Basu was not from Library Science department,  
by 81 universities, located in 22 states of India has  been  collected.  The  universities  conducting  PhD  programme  through  distance  mode  have  not  been  included  in  this  study.  
6. ObJEcTIVES 
The basic objective of this study is to trace the  overall  growth  of  LIS  research  in  India  from  the  award  of  first  PhD  in  Library  Science.  The  other  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
(a) Know  chronological  distribution  of  PhDs  in  LIS  
during  the  last  63  years; 
(b) Identify  the  contributions  made  by  individual  
universities, Indian states and supervisors towards   
LIS  research;

(d) Identify  the  thrust  areas  of  LIS  research;  and (e) Identify  the  emerging  areas  of  research  in

7. METHODOLOGY 
To  begin  with,  latest  edition  of  Universities  Handbook6,  published  by  Association  of  Indian  Universities  (AIU),  Delhi  was  used  to  identify  the  
in  terms  of  titles,  years  or  name  of  supervisors,  etc.  In  some  cases,  same  candidate  was  found  to  be  listed  twice  under  different  universities,  years  and  spellings,  etc.  As  regards  university  websites  are  concerned,  very  few  were  offering  information  about  LIS  departments,  but  no  information  about  PhDs  awarded  was  given.  In  some  cases,  PhDs  information was there but it was not up to date. So  non-availability of information about the departments  on  university  websites  was  a  serious  limitation.  other frequent problem being faced was that many  
universities/departments/schools/colleges conducting websites  could  not  be  opened  because  either  the  PhD program on regular basis. To be comprehensive, server was down or the department’s site was under  other  sources  were  also  used  and  a  list  of  83 construction. Although,  two  exclusive  online  Indian  departments conducting regular PhD programme was repositories are also available on PhD data, namely,  
prepared.  for  collecting  the  requisite  information,  a  questionnaire  was  designed  and  the  same  was  
Vidyanidhi and  Shodhganga , but these too were not  found to be of much help because Vidyanidhi   was  
sent to these 83 departments through e-mail and/or found  to  be  non-functional  most  of  the  times,  and  post.  Simultaneously,  search  in  printed  and  online Shodhganga   was  not  comprehensive  in  coverage,  sources was also started to collect the relevant data. as  only  190  PhDs  in  LIS  were  found  listed  in  it  at  
Among print sources, PEARL: A Journal of Library &  Information Science; DESIDOC Bulletin of Information  Technology;  University  News7;  IASLIC  Newsletter8 (both  print  and  online),  and  CLIS  Observer,  etc.,  were  scanned  regularly.  Two  main  online  Indian  repositories  on  PhD  theses,  namely  Vidyanidhi  and  Shodhganga 
9,  InfLIBnet 
  (Information  Library  network, UGc) were also accessed. oPAc  of  national  Social Science Documentation Centre10  ( nASSDoc)  and  website  of  universities  and  departments  were  also  accessed.  Personal  phone  calls  to  the  heads,  professional colleagues and faculty members of LIS  department  were  also  made  for  collecting  the  data  of  their  respective  departments.  
For  the  purpose  of  analysis,  a  database  was  created in MS-Access using 21 fields for processing,  analyses and presentation of data in various Tables.  The database contained the name of PhD scholars,  topics of research, name of single/ joint supervisors,  years of award and the name of the university, state,  etc.  For  assigning  subject  headings  to  PhD  titles,  a controlled vocabulary was developed using Sears  List of Subject Headings11   ( ed.  20)  and  other  such  sources.  Thereafter,  data  was  analysed  according  to  different  parameters  and  the  same  is  presented  in  subsequent  section  under  Data Analysis. 
8. LIMITATIONS AND  PRObLEMS  FAcED 
Efforts were made to make the study comprehensive  and up to date but two departments did not respond  in  spite  of  repeated  reminders,  mails  and  phone  
the  time  of  access. 
9. DATA  ANALYSIS          
for  this  study,  data  of  1754  PhDs  awarded  from  81  universities,  located  in  22  states  of  India  was  collected  up  to  2012.  Quantitative  analysis  of  the  data  has  been  presented  under  the  following  heads: 
• Distribution  by  decades 
• Distribution  by  universities 
• Distribution  by  states 
• Top  ranking  subjects 
• Emerging  areas  in  LIS  research  
• Distribution  by  supervisors 
• Distribution  by  languages,  and 
• P h D s   a w a r d e d   f r o m   o t h e r   t h a n   L I S  
departments. 
9.1 Distribution  by  Decades  
It  is  evident  from  Table  1  that  during  the  first  two  decade  of  1950-59  and  1960-69,  just  2  PhDs  were  awarded  in  each  decade.  This  growth  was  multiplied  8  times  during  1972-79  when  16  PhDs  were awarded in 8 years at the rate of 2 PhDs per  year. Thereafter continuous growth was witnessed at  the rate of 10.3 PhDs per year during 1980-89 and  38.5 PhDs per year during 1990-99. Growth during  the next decade of 2000-09 crossed all the previous  
calls. While collecting the data, it was surprising to  
records as it was more than double (80.4 PhDs/year).  
However, last decade covering only three years form  
find that large number of LIS departments were not  maintaining their PhD data even in this technology- based  era,  when  record  creation  and  maintenance  has  become  so  convenient  and  easy.  However,  majority  of  the  departments  provided  information  in  raw  form  which  in  many  cases  was  incomplete  
172 
2010-2012  superseded  the  growth  rate  of  all  the  previous  decades  as  432  PhDs  were  awarded  just  within these 3 years at an average rate of 144 PhDs  per  year.  Thus,  it  can  be  inferred  that  the  number  of  PhDs  awarded  is  continuously  increasing  at  a  good  increasing  average  annual  rate  (fig.  1).

justify their research output although, award of first  
PhD  in  these  departments  took  longer  time  which  
was 18 years for Karnataka, 28 years for Pune and  
27  years  for  Madras.  Among  all  LIS  departments,  
although Andhra University’s Department is the oldest  
which  took  48  years  to  award  its  first  PhD,  still  it  
could compete with Pune and Madras  because of its  
annual average growth rate. On the contrary, Delhi  
University which was the first to award its first PhD,  
has  fallen  at  the  bottom  because  it  awarded  PhDs  
at the lowest average rate of 1.05 PhDs/year, yet it

which  are  offering  PhD  programme  and  awarded  1  1754  PhDs  have  been  awarded  by  81  universities  
to 224 PhDs. Table 3 provides data of only 11 high  (Annexure-I).  Analysis  of  top  ranking  universities

State-wise  average growth of PhDs (calculated by dividing total  number  of  PhDs  awarded  by  each  state  with  total  period  of  research  of  that  state)  reveals  change  in  rank  order  as  compared  with  descending  order  adopted to present the total research output of each  state. This  change  is  there  because  of  variation  in  number  of  universities  offering  PhD  programme  in  each state and also state-wise variation in the total  span  period  of  research.    
9.4 Distribution  by  Subjects 
for subject analysis, all 1754 PhDs were grouped  into 99 subject headings using controlled vocabulary  developed  for  this  study  on  the  basis  of  Sears  List  of  Subject  Headings.  Table  4  projects  13  top  ranking  subjects  on  which  maximum  number  of  PhDs  (53.24  %)  have  been  awarded.  of  these,  Bibliometrics/Scientometrics/Webometrics  studies  taken  together  have  been  found  to  be  the  most  popular  area  of  research  with  171  (9.75  %)  PhDs,  followed by Library Personnel with 114 (6.5 %) PhDs;  Information  Seeking  Behaviour  with  94  (5.36  %)  PhDs;  and  Information  Services  with  73  (4.16  %)   PhDs. Total of these four subject areas account for  25.77  %  of  total  research  output.

in  thrust  areas  of  LIS  research  from  traditional  librarianship  to  It-related  areas.  As  a  result  in  recent  decades,  several  PhDs  have  been  awarded  on IT-related areas. First three areas in Table 4 are  of  very  popular  nature  on  which  maximum  PhDs  have  been  awarded,  followed  by  other  17  areas  that  are  slowly  gaining  attention  in  LIS  research.  
In present day environment, information technology Decade-wise analysis about the emergence of these areas in table 5 reveals that out of total 20 subject  and  social  development  of  India  but  also  in  the areas, only 4 have emerged during 1980-1989 and 5  during  1990-1999.

9.7 Distribution  by  Languages 
In  Library  Science,  majority  of  the  PhDs  are  submitted and awarded in English language. However,  some  universities  allow  submission  of  PhDs  in  other  languages  also  such  as  Hindi,  Marathi  and  Bengali  languages.  Decade-wise  data  in  Table  7  reveals  that  out  of  total  1754  PhDs,  77  PhDs  were  submitted  in  these  four  languages.  Of  these  77  PhDs,  highest  percentage  of  PhDs  are  in  Hindi  (64.93  %);  followed  by  Bengali/Gujarati  (12.98  %  each),  and  Marathis  (9.09  %).

9.8 PhDs  from  other  than  LIS  Departments 
Initially very limited number of LIS departments  were offering PhD programme because at that time  in majority of the LIS departments, neither adequate  infrastructure facilities nor the research supervisors  were  available.  At  that  time,  many  universities  provided the opportunity to library professionals who  were willing to do PhD in Library Science to register  themselves in other departments of their university.  First  such  PhD  was  awarded  to  Manindra  Nath  Basu in 1950 from University of calcutta on a topic  Museum  Method  and  the  Process  of  Cleaning  and  Preservation. About 18 such university departments  falling under Social Sciences, Humanities, Commerce  &  Management,  etc.,  registered  and  facilitated  award  of  total  33  PhDs  in  Library  Science-related  areas  from  their  university. Among  these  33  PhDs,  maximum  PhDs  (9)  were  awarded  from  history  Department,  for  other  departments,  the  number  varied  from  1-2. 
10. DIScUSSIONS 
(i) Initially  research  activities  in  LIS  were  at  low  
pace. As a result, only 25 PhDs were awarded  
during  1950-1982    (0.75  PhDs  per  annum)  but  
during 1983-1992, research activities got sudden  
momentum  showing  continuously  rising  trend  
with  the  award  of  196  PhDs  (19.6  PhDs  per  
annum). this rise was still higher during 1993- 
2002  when  485  PhDs  were  awarded  (48.5  per  
annum)  and  highest  in  2003-2012  with  1048  
PhDs  (104.8  per  annum)  just  in  three  years. 
176 
(ii) It  was  observed  that  the  research  output  of  
younger  university  departments  was  much  
higher  than  the  older  ones,  as  they  had  the  
privilege  of  starting  research  programme  with  
good faculty strength and infrastructure facilities.  
Older  departments  suffered  for  a  long  time  for  
infrastructure  as  well  as  adequacy  of  faculty  
strength  to  supervise.  As  a  result,  there  has  
been  longer  gap  for  awarding  the  first  PhD. (iii) Regarding growth of PhDs in states, it has been  
found  that  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Madhya  
Hindi Nil 2

12 16 10 50 (64.93 %) 
Marathi Nil 1 Nil Nil 2 2 2 7 (9.09 %)

Pradesh,  tamil  nadu,  and  Andhra  Pradesh  
together  contribute  to  53.13  %  of  total  output.  
This  picture  is  emerging  because  the  number  
of  universities  is  more  in  these  states.  (iv) In  recent  times  it  has  been  observed  that  the  
registration for PhD is continuously increasing.  
Probably  PhD  being  a  higher  and  prestigious  
degree, majority of the professionals are getting  
interested  in  upgrading  their  profile  to  attain  
higher positions. Availability of financial assistance  
to young professionals by qualifying the Junior  
Research  fellowship  exam  of  UGc   provided  
further impetus to researchers.  Above all, UGc’s  
insistence  on  qualification  of  PhD  for  higher  
positions  is  also  prompting  the  professionals  
to  obtain  PhD  degree  out  of  necessity.  But  
this  quantum  jump  has  affected  the  quality  of  
research  as  till  recently  in  many  universities,  
single  supervisor  was  guiding  large  number  of  
candidates even without having adequate research  
facilities.  But  now  UGc   has  fixed  the  number  
of  candidates  to  be  guided  by  professor  (8),  
associate professor (6) and assistant professor  
(4)  for  guiding  the  PhDs. 
(v) It  has  been  found  that  good  numbers  of  PhDs  
awarded are surveys, which are oriented towards  
some  phenomena  of  a  particular  library  or  
group  or  type  of  libraries.  Such  surveys  are  
taken  up  with  some  well-defined  objectives  to  
bring  improvement  in  the  existing  situation  of  
libraries. But it has been observed that usually  

========7========

SInGh & BABBAR: DoctoRAL  Re SeARch In LIBRARy AnD  Info RMAtIon ScIence In InDIA 
outcomes/suggestions  of  such  studies  are  not  
communicated  to  respective  libraries  to  bring  
improvement  in  the  existing  library  conditions.  
This  demands  that  there  must  be  some  kind  
of  understanding  between  the  scholar  and  the  
concerned  library  to  implement  all  possible  
suggestions.  Moreover,  such  results  must  be  
widely publicised through online forums, social  
networking or regular publications, etc., among  
the  LIS  professionals  to  enable  them  to  take  
advantage  of  such  findings.  
(vi)   f rom  various  titles  of  PhDs,  it  has  been  found  
very  limited  number  of  studies  have  been  
carried  out  on  theoretical  aspects  to  expand  
the  theoretical  base  of  LIS.  In  this  regard,  
Varalakshmi12   has  also  pointed  out  that  there  
is a need to concentrate on theoretical studies  
to add new theories and concepts. She further  
stressed that unless the research is not directed  
towards theoretical base, future development of  
the profession will remain stagnated and chain  
us  to  the  past.  
(vii) It  environment has raised the market expectations  
by  directly  affecting  the  LIS  schools  as  well  
as  libraries  to  perform  better.  With  this  new  
dimension,  it  is  interesting  to  find  that  during  
the last one decade or so, there is a clear shift  
of  research  interest  among  LIS  professionals  
also from traditional areas to currently emerging  
areas  like,  ‘Web  Resources’,  ‘open  Access  
Resources’, ‘e-learning Resources’, ‘total Quality  
Management’,  ‘Websites’  and  ‘Search engine’,  
‘Design and Development of Models in Different  
areas’, etc., which is a good sign of development  
in  the  field  of  LIS.    
(viii)there  is  a  continuous  quantitative  growth  in  
doctoral research in LIS but the prevailing situation  
calls for serious attention by a national body (as  
suggested by national Knowledge commission13,  
India)  for  prescribing  and  implementing  some  
minimum  standards  for  maintaining  the  quality  
of research. Further, such a body should ensure  
that  all  the  LIS  departments  of  India  must  
adhere to uniform standard practices which are  
presently  varying  from  state  to  state.    
11.   c ONcLUSIONS 
The  present  study  reveals  that  research  in  LIS  was  at  low  ebb  up  to  late  1970s,  but  after  that  the  number  of  PhDs  has  been  continuously  increasing decade by decade. Present decade has  crossed  all  previous  records  as  just  within  three  years  from  2010-2012,  the  number  of  PhDs  has  
increased at the highest average rate of 144 PhDs/  year.  Probably  this  increase  is  happening  because  majority of the departments are now having qualified  research  guides  and  are  paying  due  attention  on  developing  adequate  infrastructure  for  research.  Moreover, UGC has also laid down the condition of  PhD as an essential qualification for higher positions  both  in  libraries  as  well  as  in  LIS  departments.  While it is appreciable to note that more and more  young  professionals  are  pursuing  research,  but  there  is  an  evident  need  to  ensure  that  quality  of  research  is  not  compromised.  Moreover,  while  selecting the topic for research, due attention must  be paid on interdisciplinary areas, having universal  significance and potential to expand the boundaries  of  knowledge.  Another  important  point  which  all  scholars as well as supervisors must keep in mind is  that the topics chosen for research must be of high  standard  as  value  of  research  lies  in  quality  not  in  quantity. Perhaps there is a dire need to control this  mushrooming growth in LIS research. For this, there  must be some national body devoted to monitor and  ensure  the  adherence  to  research  standards.  The  Indian  Institute  of  Library  and  Information  Science  as  proposed  by national  Knowledge commission  (India) must take the responsibility to control, direct  and  prescribe  standards  for  conduct  and  award  of  PhD  degree  but  unfortunately  till  date  neither  this  Institute  has  come  up  nor  the  proposal  has  been  implemented.
