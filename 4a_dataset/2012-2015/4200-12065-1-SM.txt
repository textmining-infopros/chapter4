ABSTRACT 
Users’ studies are one of the most prominent areas of research in library and information science.  Now the trend is to examine the use of e-libraries, e-journals and e-databases. Many studies have been  carried out both in India and abroad in this area. This study aims to examine the user behaviour of 66  out of 100 research scholars and faculty members of select departments at the University of Mysore like  environmental science, sericulture science, zoology and genetics form the sample. Structured questionnaire  with  5  point  scale  was  used  and  the  mean  and  SD  values  were  calculated  using  SPSS. The  major  fndings are: Users use both print and electronic sources of information. Majority of the respondents have  learnt to use e-journals effectively from ‘friends/colleagues’. The respondents ‘look for quality controlled  scientifc and scholarly journals’. Respondents identify relevant electronic articles by ‘browsing through  recent  issues’  (mean=3.39)  followed  by  ‘searching  full-text  databases  from  publishers  or  aggregator’   
(e.g. Elsevier, Springer). 
Keywords:  E-journals, e-databases, search engines, effective use, evaluation, academia  
1. INTRODUCTION  
Users’ studies are one of the most research  areas in library and information science. Roughly  few thousand papers published have been published  in last three decades. Guruprasad & Nikam1  inter  alia  in  their  book  ‘Recent  trends  in  Electronic  Information Resource’ reported that between 1975- 77,  there  is  a  growth  rate  of  over  thirty  studies  per year2. Alongwith studies on information use,  information seeking behaviour and communication  behaviour, lot of studies are being carried out in  the  area  of  use  of  e-resources  in  general  and  e-journals    and  e-databases  in  particular.  One  of  significant  studies  of  the  recent  times  is  use  patterns of e-information resources by Aerospace  engineers and scientists carried out by Guruprasad3 as  part  of  doctoral  work  is  worth  noting.  This  study is largely based on the work of Tenopir &  King4.  Some  of  the  Indian  studies  are  those  of  authors  like  Nikam  &  Promodini5,  Moghaddam  &  Talawar6,  Madusudan7,  Despande  &  Pathak8,  Haridasan  &  Khan9,  and  Satpathy  &  Ravath10 which  are  related  to  the  present  study.  
E-information  resources  in  general  and  e-journals/databases  in  particular  have  made  enormous impact on the scholarly communication  of academia in universities and related research  institutes. Consistent use of these resources by  
the  scholarly  community  has  not  only  increased  research productivity but also added to the quality.  e-journals  have  made  the  access  of  scientific  information  convenient  and  easy.  Investment  on  subscribing  to  e-journals  by  the  libraries  attached  to  institution  of  higher  education  has  provided  good  value  for  money  and  the  benefits  to  both  the  scientific  community  are  for  wider  than  the  use  of  off-line  journals.  This  study  is  an  attempt  to  evaluate  the  effective  use  of  these  journals  by  the  academia  of  the  University  of  Mysore  drawn  form  a  few  disciplines  like  environmental  science,  sericulture  science,  zoology,  and  genetics.    
2. SCOPE  AND  COVERAGE  
Scope  of  the  present  study  is  confine  to  the  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  of  the  University  of  Mysore.  An  attempt  is  made  here  to  evaluate  the  use  and  accessing  of  e-journals.  The  scope  of  the  study  is  further  restricted  to  few  science  departments  of  University  of  Mysore  such  as  -  Environmental  science,  Sericulture  science,  Zoology and Genetics. In order to make an intensive  study, the scope of the topic has been limited only  to  the  University  of  Mysore  and  the  disciplines  as  mentioned above. The students of Masters Degree  are  not  chosen  as  the  sample.

3. OBJECTIVES  OF  STUDY  
The  main  objectives  of  the  study  are  to:  (i) Know  the  purpose  of  seeking  information;  (ii) Study  the  frequency  of  using  e-journals; (iii) Make  a  comparative  analysis  of  usage  of  print  
verses  e-journals; 
(iv) Find  out  the  preferred  place  for  accessing  
e-journals; 
(v) Determine the problems faced in accessing and  
using  e-journals;  and 
(vi) Know the extent of use of library for accessing  
e-journals.  
4. METHODOLOGY  
For  collection  of  data  survey  method  and  questionnaire  tool  is  used  in  this  study.  The  questionnaire  covers  questions  like  personal  data,  purpose  of  information  seeking,  e-journal  use  and  impact,  Use  of  open  access  journal,  and  library  use. Nearly 66 questionnaires were obtained among  the  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  of  the  University  of  Mysore  covering  four  departments  such as Environmental science, Sericulture science,  Zoology,  and  Genetics.  Statistical  tools  like  Mean  and  SD  and  simple  percentages  were  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  data.  
5. RESULTS AND  DISCUSSIONS 
Out  of  66  respondents,  the  majority  of  the  respondents are research scholars representing 45  (62.1  %)  and  remaining  21  (37.9  %)  respondents  are  faculty  members.  More  than  half  of  them  are  from Genetics and Zoology representing 36 (54.5 %)  followed  by  Environment  Science  17  (25.8  %)  and  Sericulture Science 13 (19.7 %). It was seen that out  of 66 respondents, 38 (57.6 %) respondents are male  and  28  (42.4  %)  are  female.  Further,  most  of  the  faculty member and research scholars are engaged  actively in ‘basic research’ (mean=1.54); ‘teaching’  (mean=1.03);  ‘research,  design  and  development’  (mean=0.97);  ‘guiding  for  research’  (mean=0.68)  and ‘management/administration’ (mean=0.50). The  respondents  state  that  before  joining  the  present  job  they  have  worked  in  ‘academic/educational  organisation(s)’ representing 39 (59.1 %), 16 (24.2 %)  of them have worked in ‘research and development  institutes’.  Nearly  4.5  %  each  have  worked  for  ‘industry’  and  ‘government’.              
5.1 Purpose  of  Seeking  Information 
The  main  purpose  of  seeking  information  by  respondents is ‘to do research work and to write articles’  
126 
(mean=3.67,  SD=0.64);  ‘to  participate  in  meetings,  seminars  conferences’  (mean=2.54,  SD=1.53);  ‘to keep up to date’ (mean=2.39, SD=1.67); to prepare  for ‘teaching’ (mean=2.12, SD=1.63), and ‘to submit  funded  project’  (mean=1.97,  SD=1.63). 
5.2 Use  of  E-information  Sources  for  Research 
Users  use  both  print  and  electronic  sources  of  information.  Usage  are  shown  in  Table  1.

The majority of the respondents stated that they  search  information  within  a  day  57  (86.36  %),  8  (12.12  %)  search  information  within  a  week,  sand  only  1  (1.52  %)  search  for  the  information  within  a  month. 
5.4  Methods  to  Use  E-Journal  Effectively  and  
Ways  to  Identify Articles 
The  majority  of  the  respondents  that  have  learnt  to  use  e-journals  from  ‘friends/colleagues’  (mean=2.79, SD=1.39) followed by those who use is  by ‘trial/error’ (mean=2.57, SD=1.41); ‘got guidance  from  teachers’  (mean=1.55,  SD=1.47);  ‘through  library orientation and training program’ (mean=1.00,  SD=1.36).  The  survey  reveals  that  majority  of  the  respondents identify relevant e-articles by ‘browsing  through  recent  issues’  (Table.  2)  and  search  much  less  by  relying  on  alerting  services’  (based  on  a  personal  profile).

5.11 Strategy  Used  for  Accessing  E-journals  
Articles 
To  access  e-journals  several  strategies  are  used by the library users including author, subject,  title,  keyword  search,  date  of  publication,  etc.  The  search  strategies  used  by  the  respondents  are  shown  in  Table  7.

5.12  Preferred  Format  and  Search  Engines  
The articles appearing in e-journals are available  in PDF and HTML formats. An attempt was made to  find out which of these two file formats respondents  prefer for downloading the e-papers. The PDF format  is  the  most  opted  one  with  a  mean  of  3.59  and  SD=1.08  and  the  next  being  HTML  with  a  mean  of  1.76  and  SD=1.43. 
The  users  of  information  use  many  search  engines to access e-information. The most popular  search engines used are google, yahoo, altavista,  etc. It may be seen from the Table 8 that the search  engines  ‘Google’  is  most  preferred.

5.13 Open Access  Journals  -  Level  of     
Awareness 
Open  access  journals  (OAJs)  are  all  the  time  available  for  reference  to  the  information  users  on  the  Internet.  But  the  issue  is,  are  they  aware  of  it?  Hence  an  attempt  is  made  here  to  find  out  no.  of  journals  they  are  aware  of. 
Large number of respondents are aware of at  least  ‘4-7’  OAJs  in  their  own  field  representing  32  (48.5 %) followed by those who are aware of ‘more  
128 
than  10  open  OAJs  in  their  own  filed  12  (18.2  %)  of  them  say  that  they  are  aware  of  more  than  10  OAJs.  Nearly  9  respondents  representing  13.6  %  are  aware  of  1-3  open  access  journals  and  7  of  those  representing  10.6  %  are  not  aware  of  any  OAJs.  Only  6  of  those  scoring  9.1  %  are  aware  of  8-9  OAJs.        
5.14 Availability  of  Funds  to  Pay  Publication  
Fees 
When  the  information  users  want  to  publish  the  article  in  open  access  journals,  they  have  to  pay  for  it.  So,  the  question  is  who  should  pay  for  it  and  from  which  source?  So  an  attempt  is  made  here  to  find  out  where  do,  the  funds  come  from.  The  respondents  opine  that  it  comes  from  ‘my  research  grant’  (mean=2.14,  SD=1.63);  ‘library/ institution funds’ (mean=1.83, SD=1.73) ‘my personal  funds’  (mean=1.26,  SD=1.42);  ‘department  funds’  (mean=1.21,  SD=1.48)  and  ‘commercial  sponsors’  (mean=0.76,  SD=1.18). 
5.15  Length  of  Publishing  Articles  in  Open  
Access  Journals 
An  attempt  has  been  made  to  find  out  since  when the respondents are publishing in open access  journals. The  respondents  have  been  publishing  in  open access journals since ‘One year’ (mean=1.45,  SD=1.65); followed by ‘One to two year’ (mean=0.82,  SD=1.36); ‘More than four year’ (mean=0.55, SD=1.23)  and  ‘Three  to  four  year’  (mean=0.50,  SD=0.98).  5.16  Use  of  Open Access  Directories 
Open  access  directories  are  free  source  of  accessing information on the internet. Various open  access  directories  are  used  by  the  respondents  which is based on certain recommendations/sources  shown  in  Table  9.

6.  CONCLUSIONS 
The main purpose for which the respondents seek  information  is  most  ‘to  do  research  work  and  write  articles’  (mean=3.67)  and  the  least  purpose  being  ‘to  submit  funded  project  (mean=1.97).  Users  use  both print and e-sources of information. Highly used  print source are ‘journals’ and in case of electronic  source  ‘e-journals’  are  used  most.  The  least  used  print  sources  are  ‘trade  literature/reports’  and  the  least  electronic  sources  being  ‘e-trade  literature/ reports’.  Majority  of  the  respondents  state  that,  they  search  information  within  a  day  representing  57  (86.36  %).  Very  few  of  them  take  a  month  to  search the information. Majority of the respondents  have learnt to use e-journals effectively from ‘friends/ colleagues’  and  the  least  used  contact  ‘through  library  orientation  and  training  programme’.  The  survey  reveals  that  majority  of  the  respondents  identify relevant e-articles by ‘browsing through recent  issues’ (mean=3.39) and the method least is ‘relying  on  alerting  services’  (based  on  a  personal  profile).  Main  reasons  for  problems  faced  by  respondents  while  using  the  e-journals  stated  is  ‘poor  internet  connectivity’  (mean=2.44)  and  the  problem  least  faced  by  respondents  while  using  the  e-journals  on  the  campus  is  ‘inadequate  computer  systems’  (mean=1.47). Users seek help from the library staff  for the main purpose as ‘to locate books’ (mean=1.92)  and  the  least  purpose  being  ‘to  access  e-journal’  (mean=1.33).  Very  few  users  have  attended  the  awareness  and  training  programme  for  accessing  e-journals by the INFLIBNET representing 7 (10.6 %)  and  many    respondents  have  not  attended  the  awareness  programme  representing  38  (57.6  %).  Most of the respondents do not visit library at all to  access e-journals representing 28 (42.42 %). Those  who  visit  the  library  are  very  few  2  (3.03  %).  The  important features of e-journals which are stated by  respondents  is  ‘articles  are  displayed  clearly  in  an  easy to read format’ (mean=2.45) and the least being  ‘a  user  friendly  interface’  (mean=1.65).  The  uses  of  e-journals  through  publisher  by  the  respondents  in  that  majority  of  respondents  use  the  publisher  ‘Springer  Link’  and  the  least-used  publisher  being  
‘Royal  Society  of  Chemistry’.  It  may  be  seen  that  ‘title of article’ is the most frequently used strategy  for accessing e-journal articles by respondents and  the  least  used  strategy  being  ‘ISBN’  (mean=1.05).  The  PDF  format  is  the  most  opted  one  and  the  next being HTML. ‘Google’ is most preferred search  engine for accessing information on the Internet by  the respondents with a mean score of 3.68 and least  used  search  engine  is  ‘AltaVista’.  Large  number  of  respondents  are  aware  of  ‘4-7’  open  access  journals in their own filed representing 32 (48.5 %).  Funds for publishing papers in open access journals  comes  from  ‘my  research  grant’  to  pay  publication  fees.  The  use  of  various  open  access  directories  by  the  respondents  is  based  on  ‘recommendation  from  colleagues’  (mean=1.15).
