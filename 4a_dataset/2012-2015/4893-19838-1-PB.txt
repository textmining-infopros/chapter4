ABSTRAcT 
 The article explores the scientometric assessment of publication productivity of Jawaharlal Nehru  Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI). The data for the study was taken from the  Annual report of the JNTBGRI from 2001-2010 which were then tabulated and analysed. The scientists  of JNTBGRI prefer mostly Indian journals to publish their articles. Journal of Economic Taxonomic Botany tops  the  list  with  the  highest  number  of  articles  50  (9.11  %),  followed  by Zoos  (Print  Journal)   with  39  articles. India is the leading country with 54.67 % of total journals. The collaboration coeffcient of journal  article during the year 2010 is found to be 0.7541. The articles published in the journal Current Science got 45 citations and Journal of Ethnopharmacology  got only 5 citations. The article tries to analyse the  country-wise  distribution  of  journals,  collaboration-coeffcient  in  research  and  subject  areas  in  which  
research has been done.

1. INTRoducTIoN 
Scientific  research  is  an  information-producing  activity,  the  essence  of  which  is  communication.  According to Merton1, scientific communication is a  highly  complex  system.  Evaluating  the  productivity  of  an  institution’s  research  activity  highlights  the  contribution  of  the  institution  and  the  individual  scientists engaged in research. It also provides some  insights into the complex dynamics of research activity  and  enables  the  policy  makers  and  administrators  to make available adequate facilities and direct the  research activities in a proper direction. A well known  productivity  indicator  is  the  number  of  publications  produced  by  the  scientists  of  an  institution.  The  institution  which  is  generating  a  good  number  of  quality  research  papers  in  particular  field  may  be  considered  as  a  frontier  institution  in  that  field. 
Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and  Research  Institute  (JNTBGRI),  formerly  Tropical  Botanical  Garden  and  Research  Institute  is  an  autonomous institute established by the Government  of Kerala on 17 November 1979 at the capital city of  Kerala. It functions under the umbrella of the Kerala  State Council for Science, Technology & Environment  (KSCSTE),  of  Government  of  Kerala.  The  Royal  Botanic Gardens (RBG), Kew played an exemplary  
and significant role in shaping and designing of the  garden’s  layout  in  its  formative  stages2.

institutions (PRIs) in Korea's science and engineering  fields.  For  the  construction  of  R&D  collaborating  networks  based  on  the  co-authorship  data  of  127  institutions in Scopus. This paper proposes four types  of  collaborations  by  categorising  network  analyses  into  two  dimensions:  structural  positions  (density,  efficiency, and betweens centrality) and the relational  characteristics of individual nodes (eigenvector and  closeness centralities).  The empirical results suggest  that  excessively  cohesive  alliances  might  end  up  in  'lock-in'  relations,  hindering  the  exploitation  of  new  opportunities  for  innovation.  These  findings  are  implicit  in  relation  to  the  Korean  Government's  R&D policies on collaborating strategies to produce  sustained  research  results  with  the  advent  of  the  convergence research  era. 
Vasishta4 examined the contribution and impact  of research output of PEC University of Technology  as  reflected  in  its  publications  covered  in  Scopus  international  multidisciplinary  database.  The  study  described  the  broad  characteristics  of  research  publications  of  PEC  during  1996-2009,  its  growth,  format,  media  of  communication,  national  and  international collaboration profile and overall citation  impact,  distribution  of  research  output  and  impact  under  broad  subjects  and  under  different  subject  departments, most productive authors, and highly cited  papers.  The  result  shows  that  in  all  177  research  papers were published during 14 years period, i.e.,  from 1996 to 2009, by the nine departments of the  PEC  showing  an  annual  average  growth  rate  of  131.85 %. Growth in the academic research output  was  seen  after  the  PEC  has  acquired  the  deemed  university  status.  Contribution  to  engineering  and  technology literature from this institute was steadily  increasing  since  then.    
Bhatia5  analyse quantitatively research publications  published  by  the  scientists  of  National  Institute  of  Occupational health (ICMR) Ahmedabad, India, during  2000–2006. The result shows that more publications  are  observed  in  journals  dealing  in  occupational  health  and  occupational  medicine,  which  is  related  to institutional research field. Multiple-author articles  are more than single-author articles because research  format in occupational health is multi-disciplinary. To  carry out research in multiple disciplines/parameter  one  requires  more  scientists  and  core  subject  in  occupational  health  and  occupational  medicine.  
Mahbuba6  provided  a  scientometric  ,     al., et 
comparison  between  two  health  and  population  research  organisations,  namely  the  International  Centre  for  Diarrhoeal  Research  in  Bangladesh  (ICDDR,  B)  and  the  National  Institute  of  Cholera  and  Enteric  Diseases  (NICED)  in  India,  during  the  period  1979-2008.  These  institutes  conduct  similar  research  and  collaboration  ties.  Data  was  collected  from  the Web  of  Science (WoS)  as  well  as from official records of these two organisations.

The  analysis  presents  the  evolution  of  publication  activities.  Special  attention  is  given  to  research  impact  through  time  series  of  the  institutional  h-  and  R-indices,  as  well  as  to  the  trend  in  yearly  citations received. Types of publications, international  collaboration with other countries, top scientists and  most cited articles co-authored by scientists from these  institutions are highlighted. It is observed that female  scientists play a minor role in these two institutes. 
Sharma7   analysed  a  total  of  2603  research  articles published by the scientists of Central Potato  Research  Institute  (CPRI)  during  1991-2007  were  collected by scanning of annual reports of CPRI and  Journal of  the Indian Potato Association. Analysis  show  that  majority  of  the  scientists  preferred  to  publish research papers in joint authorship (82.67 %)  having  0.82  degree  of  collaboration.  Study  further  shows  no  uniform  pattern  of  literature  growth  but  factors  like  fund  availability,  scientists’  recruitment  and  their  availability,  and  years  that  had  special  occasions  like  conferences,  seminars,  etc.,  have  impact  over  scientific  productivity  of  the  scientists  during  the  period  under  review. 
Rani & Jinju8  analysed the productivity of scientists  of  Rajiv  Gandhi  Centre  for  Biotechnology. Analysis  of 632 publications of RGCB scientists during 1995- 2006 show that the publications of RGCB scientists  include journal articles, conference papers, patents,  book  chapters,  and  PhD  guided.  The  year  2005- 2006 with 112 articles (25.87 %) published was the  most productive year in the case of journal articles.  The  productivity  of  the  scientists  of  RGCB  shows  substantial  growth  quantitatively  and  qualitatively  with  the  development  of  the  institution. 
Kademani9, et  al.,   presented  a  scientrometrics  analysis  of  the  papers  published  by  the  analytical  chemistry division of Bhabha Atomic Research Center  (BARC) in India. The main objective was to document  quantitatively  the  publication  behavior  of  scientists  at BARC to determine their publication productivity,  domain-wise research productivity, and to identify the  most prolific authors and author productivity, among  others.  It  also  traces  the  growth  in  publications  of  the  analytical  chemistry  division  since  1972.  
Dutta  &  Sen10   made  a  study  on  the  scattering  of  articles  over  a  journal  system  as  observed  from  the  viewpoint  of  Bose-Einstein  Statistics.  Rank  vs.  number  of  articles  distribution  pattern  of  a  journal  system  has  been  investigated  from  the  viewpoint  of  Bose-Einstein  statistics  assuming  a  subject  as  equivalent to a phase space, a specific or microsubject  as  equivalent  to  a  phase  cell  and  corresponding  journals  as  the  Bose-Einstein  particles.

5.  ANALySIS 
Table 2. country-wise analysis of journals 
5.1  Rank  List  of  Journals S. No. 
In  the  field  of  S&T,  in  every  subject  there  1. are  some  journals  which  are  frequently  referred  
2. by  the  researchers  because  of  the  close  relation  
between  the  subject  of  the  journals  and  the  areas  
3. of  research  works.  These  highly  cited  journals  are  
4. termed as ‘core journals’ of a specific subject. The  
5 core journals always contain a higher concentration  
of  relevant  articles  on  a  particular  discipline  and  
6. the rest of the papers on the subject are scattered  
7. over  a  large  number  of  journals  (Table  1). 
8.. 
The  ‘Journal  of  Economic  Taxonomic  Botany ’,  
published from India showed maximum no. of articles  
9. published, came in the 1st  position with 50 articles,’  
10. ‘Current  Science’  with  11  articles  having  impact  
11. factor of 0.935 and ‘Journal of Ethnopharmacology’  
with 10 articles having impact factor of 2.755 came  
12. in  2nd   and  3 
rd 
  position. 
13. 5.2  country-wise  Analysis  of  Journals  
14. 
The  journals  are  analysed  accsording  to  their  
15. country of origin. The list of countries is quite long  16. as  24  countries  published  150  journals.  Out  of  the  24  countries  India  ranks  first  (Table  2).  
17. 
From  Table  2,  it  has  been  observed  that  India  
18. is  the  leading  country  with  82  journals  (54.67  %).  19. USA  is  in  the  second  position  with  18  journals. 
20. 5.3  collaboration  coefficient 21. 
Collaboration  coefficient  (CC)  is  a  measure  of  
22. collaboration in research that rejects both the mean  
23. number of authors per paper as well as the proportion  
of  multi-authored  papers.  According  to  Savanur  &

The derivation of the new measure is almost the same  as  that  of  CC,  as  given  by Ajiferuke12, et  al. 
      
where, α  is a normalisation constant to be determined.  Setting α  = 1 yields the measure CC. the requirement  that  κ  = 0 for single authorship does not restrict  α. If

The  MCC  was  high  (0.8079)  in  2007  and  was  
1/A. If one wants

all N articles involve all the A authors, then E [1/X] =  
κ   to satisfy the requirement that   κ 
low  (0.4842)  in  2002  (Table  4).

Scientometric analysis and studies of such kind,  namely, bibliometrics, informetrics, and webometrics  have gained much importance in the field of Library  and Information Science. These techniques can be  used  to  identify  the  emerging  research  areas  in  any  branch  of  knowledge  to  evaluate  the  research  performance  of  scientists,  research  groups  and  countries, to map the cognitive or intellectual structure  of a research area and to study the relation between  authors,  institutions  and  journal  articles.
