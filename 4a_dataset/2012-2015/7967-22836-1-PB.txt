1. INtRODUctION 
University  libraries  play  a  vital  role  in  the  achievement  of  the  objectives  of  the  Institution.  It  is an integral part of the teaching learning process  at  the  academic  level.  In  order  to  successfully  play  its  role  in  the  university  system  a  library  must  have  appropriate  resources  like  information  resources, staff, space, etc. The University libraries  make efforts to better serve the users by providing  maximum  service  with  their  available  means  or  resources. In the light of this, the library can serve  its users effectively only when it knows their specific  requirements.The  Kothari  Commission  in  its  report  on  education  and  national  development  (1964-66)  further  emphasised  that,  ‘No  university,  college  or  department  should  be  set  up  without  taking  into  account its library needs in terms of staff, journals,  space,  etc.  Nothing  could  be  more  damaging  to  a  growing  department  than  to  neglect  its  library,  the  library  should  be  an  important  centre  of  attraction  on  the  college  or  university  campus.’ 
This study is an attempt to present a comprehensive  and up to-date overview of library services and their  resources in the state of Haryana, India. The present  study  covers  the  below  mentioned  3  universities.  The rationale behind the selection of the university  libraries  is  two  fold–first,  two  state  level  university  libraries  are  compared  with  a  Private  university  library in terms of resources and services. Second,  a  random  selection  of  the  Universities  are  made  
on  the  basis  of  year  of  establishment  i.e.,  recently  established University libraries, which are operating  from  independent  buildings.

  conducted  a  study  on  ‘Status  of  State Libraries in Jharkhand, and revealed that the  state public libraries in Jharkhand are not in a good  condition.  The  Library  services  are  ill  supported,  undernourished,  unappreciated  and  under  staff,  struggling  to  provide  minimal  service.  There  has  been  growth  in  some  limited  areas,  but  it  is  only  a  beginning  and  there  is  still  a  long  way  to  go  before  the  public  is  assured  of  satisfactory  library  service. There is a great challenge before the state  government to nourish these state libraries in order  to  strengthen  the  knowledge  base  of  the  people  of  Jharkhand.  Jotwani2   reported  in  his  study  on  “Library Resources and Services in Indian Institute  of  Technology”  that  each  IIT  library  has  a  well- resourcedCentral Library to support their academic  and  research  mission.  On  the  technology  front,  Central  libraries  in  IITs  have  multipurpose  space,  better  infrastructure,  service  areas,  reading  areas  and  other  utilities.  Singh3   found  in  his  study  on  ‘Information  technology  applications  in  Technical  Institute  libraries  of  Karnal,  Haryana’  that  all  the  technical  institute  libraries  have  a  membership  of  library  consortium.  The  majority  of  the  libraries  has  the  membership  of  DELNET  to  use  the  online  journals. None of the College Libraries have UGC- INFONET consortium. All of the libraries are paying  an  amount  for  subscription  of  consortium. 3. ObJEctIVES 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
(a) Get the current status of the available information  
resources in the selected university libraries of  
Haryana 
(b) Find the status of e-resources in the university  
libraries 
(c) Determine the types of services being provided

The  response  rate  was  100  %. 
5. ANALYSIS AND  INtERPREtAtIONS 
The  data  obtained  through  the  questionnaires  is  presented  and  compared  using  tables  and  figures  method  and  analysed  by  using  the  simple  calculation  method  subsequent  sections  for  easy  comprehension: 
5.1 Library  Resources 
The  library  collection  is  a  sum  total  of  library  materials that makes up the holding of a particular  library.  Through  this  study  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  analyse  the  collection  strength  of  the  selected  university  libraries.  The  findings  were  as  here  under. 
Table 2 shows that BPSMV library has the largest  number  of  print  materials  including  text,  reference  and  book   bank  books,  i.e.,  69,139  followed  by  DCRUST library with 54,472 and OPJGU library has  the  lowest  number  of  book  collection  i.e.,  39,000.  It  has  been  noted  that  no  book  bank  facility  is  provided  by  BPSMV  and  OPJGU  library.  
Table 2 also shows that all the University libraries  provide the facility of printed journals. BPSMV library  has  the  largest  collection  of  printed  journals  i.e.,  4000 back volumes, 70 Indian and 80 foreign current  journals  are  subscribed  during  the  current  year.  This  is  followed  by  the  OPJGU  library  with  3700  back  volumes,  27  Indian  and  42  foreign  journals  are  subscribed  during  the  current  year.

with  1073  back  volumes,  96  Indian  and  4  foreign  journals  subscribed  during  the  current  year.  
Table  2  further  shows  that  only    the  DCRUST  library has a collection of 3475 standards. All libraries  subscribe newspapers, but magazines are subscribed  only  by  DCRUST  and  BPSMV  libraries. 
Table 2 in case of special collections shows that  DCRUST  has  the  highest  number  of  collections  of  special  collection,  i.e.  2372,  whereas  BPSMV  and  OPJGU  libraries  have  no  such  collection. 
E-resources like e-books, e-journals and audio- visual  material  are  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  OPJGU  library  has  the  largest  collection  of  e-books,  i.e.,  
275 in the OPJGU followed by 226 in the DCRUST  and  minimum  150  in  the  BPSMV.  The  student  membership  is  maximum  in  the  BPSMV  i.e.,  6000  followed  by  3236  in  the  DCRUST  and  the  lowest  1300  in  the  OPJGU.  Library  members  of  technical  and  non-teaching  staff  are  maximum  500  in  the  OPJGU  followed  by  309  in  the  DCRUST  and  250  in  the  BPSMV.

Figure 1. E-resources available in the university libraries. 
In  the  current  scenario  the  pace  of  change  in  higher  education  is  quite  rapid.  As  the  learning  and development and research experience become  more interactive with technology, it is imperative on  libraries to must adapt themselves accordingly. Human  resource  plays  a  prominent  role  in  the  successful  management  of  any  institution.  Hence,  library  staff  also plays and important role in collection, storage  and  dissemination  of  the  information  in  the  swift  and  user  friendly  manner  to  its  patron.  
Table  4  deals  with  the  library  staff  available  in  the  University  Libraries.  The  maximum  number  of  staff  is  in  the  OPJGU  library  i.e.,  14  while  the  other 2 libraries DCRUST and BPSMV have 7 and 4  professional staff members respectively. Though it is  a  very  good  sign  that  all  of  the  selected  university

The  OPJGU  being  a  law  university  has  subscribed  different  e-resources  than  the  other  2  university  libraries. 
5.5 Library  Space  &  Furniture 
Library space consists of stack area, rooms and  seating area in the University library. The details of  each  category  of  space  are  presented  in  Table  8. 
The  DCRUST  library  has  the  largest  covered  area of 4552 sq.mtr. followed by the OPJGU library  with  2787  sq.mtr.  and  the  BPSMV  library  has  the  lowest  covered  area  of  925  sq.mtr.  only.  
Fig. 2 reveals about seating facilities for students,  research scholars and teachers in the libraries. The  OPJGU  library  has  the  largest  number  of  seating  capacity,  i.e.,  550  followed  by  the  DCRUST  library  with 500 seating capacity. The BPSMV Library has  the  least  seating  capacity  for  its  users  i.e.,  100  only. The OPJGU has not provided separate seating  facilities  for  the  faculty. 
Table 9 shows the details of the library furniture  consists  of  tables,  chairs,  almirahs,  book  racks,  display  racks,  and  book-cases. The  OPJGU  library  has  maximum  number  of  study  tables  and  chairs  i.e.,100+400  followed  by  the  DCRUST  library  with  42+375.  The  BPSMV  has  a  minimum  number  with

10+100  only.  Office  tables  and  chairs  are  almost  same in the DCRUST 15+20 and the OPJGU library  15+18 but quite less in BPSMV library 4+4. Computer  tables and chairs are the maximum in the DCRUST  library 54+70 followed by the OPJGU library 20+20  and  minimum  in  the  BPSMV  library  15+15.  Books  are  mainly  stored  on  the  book  racks.  The  OPJGU  library  has  maximum  number  of  book  racks,  i.e.,  200 followed by the DCRUST library with 105 racks.  The BPSMV library has only 26 racks. The DCRUST  Library  has  maximum  number  of  almirahs  i.e.,  17.  Display racks for printed journals and magazines are  maximum  in  the  DCRUST  library,  i.e.,  20  followed  by  12  in  the  OPJGU  library  and  7  in  the  BPSMV  library. In addition to that the DCRUST library also  has  43  book  cases. 
5.6 Library Automation 
The OPJGU library is fully automated while the  other two are partially automated and leading towards  full automation. Library application software LIBSyS  is  being  used  by  the  DCRUST  and  the  BPSMV  library,  while  KOHA  is  being  used  in  the  OPJGU  library. The  OPJGU  and  the  BPSMV  libraries  have  Wi-Fi  connectivity  in  the  library;  the  DCRUST  has  not  yet  provided  Wi-Fi  connectivity  in  the  library.  Only  the  OPJGU  library  is  having  a  functional  RFID  system. 
Table  10  describes  about  the  availability  of  infrastructural facility in the libraries for automation  purpose.  The  table  shows  that  the  OPJGU  library  is  leading  and  has  all  the  facilities  like  FAX,  LCD  projector, TV, CD server, CCTV cameras, Bar-code  scanner,  UPS,  computer,  scanner,  xerox  machine,

server  and  printer  required  for  automation.  It  has  maximum number of computers for staff and students.  The DCRUST library also has sufficient infrastructure  required  for  automation.  However,  BPSMV  library  is  reportedly  lacking  required  infrastructure  for  automation,  particularly  it  requires  more  computer  and photocopying machine. The DCRUST and BPSMV  libraries  do  not  have  TV  and  multimedia  kit. 5.7   c onsortia  Membership 
Universities  are  facing  a  financial  crunch  and  with  upheavals  in  economies  funding  is  getting  reduced for the libraries also. The major chunk of the  university library budget is spent on the e-resources  and  no  library  is  self-reliant  enough  to  buy  all  the  resources.  Library  consortia  is  a  medium,  which  at  least  makes  it  easy  for  the  university  libraries  to  increase  their  collection  at  reduced  rates. 
Table  11  shows  the  OPJGU  library  is  member  of maximum number of consortiums i.e., 3, namely  DELNET, CSIR and INDEST followed by the DCRUST  library with a membership of two consortiums namely  INDEST  and  UGC-INFONET,  while  the  BPSMV  library has membership of UGC-INFONET consortium  only.

REcOMMENDAtIONS 
Based on the data gathered from the respondent  libraries,  the  following  suggestions  are  put  forth  to  improve  and  maximise  the  usage  of  the  university  libraries. 
(a) Problem of shortage of staff is common among  
all respondent libraries. State Govt. Universities  
should  take  note  of  the  situation  of  availability  
of  professional  staff  in  the  libraries  and  force  
the State Government to follow UGC rules. It is  
evident that libraries are not for profit organisations,  
that’s  why,  authorities  are  keeping  themselves  
blind  and  drastically  cutting  down  the  finance.  
It  is  suggested  to  properly  formulate  finance  &  
budget  provision  policy  and  implementation  be  
provided  on  proper  standards.  Well  qualified  
and  experienced  technical  staff  is  needed  in  
the  digital  section  of  the  library  to  solve  the  
user's  problems.  
(b) It  is  necessary  to  prepare  the  library  staff  
through  appropriate  training.  Rediscovery  may  
be  as  important  as  the  creation  of  knowledge  
itself in view of the development in information  
technology. 
(c) Though  the  user  base  of  the  OPJGU  library  is  
less yet the services provided are up to the mark  
and  cater  up  to  the  maximum.  State  university  
authorities  should  adopt  a  mechanism  to  raise  
their  service  standards. 
(d) Special  funds  provision  should  be  made  in  the  
annual  budget  to  improve  the  status  and  non- 
book  materials  in  the  state  university  libraries.  
The  subscription  of  e-resources  should  be  
increased.  
(e) The  new  technological  invasion  has  drastically  
affected  the  education  system.  Most  of  the  
core schools are using technology for effective  
dissemination of information and they have seen  
the  results  in  positive  directions  only.  Hence,  
AV  sections  may  be  envisaged  in  advance  by  
the  university  authorities. 
(f) Libraries  should  join  more  consortia  in  order  
provide  vast  and  current  information  to  its  
users.
