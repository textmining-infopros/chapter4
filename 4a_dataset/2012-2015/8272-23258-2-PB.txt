Information  is  an  essential  ingredient  in  our  life.  Serving  the  right  information  to  the  right  users  at  the  right time is the goal of every library and information centre. It has become necessary to manage this  information in a systematic way to achieve the goal. The process of management of a library requires  skills at various levels. These skills, though relatively independent of one another, blend together to bring  about organisational productivity, effciency, and harmony. There are a number of libraries governed by  minority communities in West Bengal. These libraries are playing remarkable role in the dissemination of  information. This article highlights and discusses the skills of information/management and its dissemination  in the various minority-governed libraries, and also explores the collection, arrangement, and management  
of these libraries.

1.    IntRoDuctIon 
Libraries  are  mainly  of  3  types-academic,  public,  and  special  libraries.  These  libraries  are  mainly governed through central government, state  government, trustee, wakf Board, private organisation,  etc. Besides these libraries, there are a number of  special  types  of  libraries  which  are  governed  by  minority communities in West Bengal. These libraries,  governed  by  the  different  minority  communities,  are  playing  remarkable  role  in  dissemination  of  information  in  the  society. 
In every corner of the world, many libraries have  been seen, they are important for spreading knowledge.  Research work is carried out in West Bengal by all  communities-Muslim  community,  Christians,  Jains,  Buddhists,  Sikhs,  Parsee  and  other  communities.   These libraries are used not only by the minorities;  but  by  other  communities  too.  These  libraries  do  not  contain  only  religious  books;  they  also  contain  creative literature, periodicals, rare collections, and  books  on  science.  
The day has arrived when it is the most important  to  learn  to  access,  analyse,  apply,  and  evaluate  information  from  the  libraries.  As  the  traditional  custodians of information, librarians need to be aware  of  the  implications  of  these  changes,  and  develop  
technological and managerial skills, which will enable  them  to  make  effective  use  of  information,  and  to  meet their organisations’ changing information needs.  In  the  present  day-to-day  context,  the  minorities’  libraries are now becoming an inseparable and integral  part of an information-based society. Because of the  increasing awareness among the users, availability  of  new  resources,  and  advanced  application  of  information communication technology, the minority  governed  libraries  are  changing  their  traditional  concept  rapidly.  
1.1  Information  Management: necessary  Skills 
Dr S.R. Ranganathan’s philosophy of information  management  has  long  been  ‘the  right  information  to  the  right  person  at  the  right  time’. This  requires  adequate and efficient information skills which help  to  know  how  and  when  information  is  used,  its  significance in a process, the most relevant sources  and  the  best  means  of  delivery.  A  skilled  person  has the ability to perform any task successfully. The  modern library and information skills play an important  part  in  facilitating  desktop  delivery  of  information,  and in managing mediated information services, their  utilisation  across  the  range  of  information  within  the organisation, increasing the value derived from  their  employment.

The  electronic  environment  of  the  21st   century  will demand a range of technological skills from the  library and Information science professionals. Besides  these  technological  skills,  the  library  professional  should  have  some  basic  skills.  The  following  skills  are  required  for  managing  information  on  the  part  of  the  library  professionals: 
• Technical  skills-classification,  cataloguing  of  
document,  indexing,  abstracting,  etc. • Managerial skills- Managing the different sections  
discussed  the  importance  of  public  relations  skills,  including  librarian’s  own  skills  that  help  the  users  to cultivate interpersonal skills as positive reference  services.

Sunita1   in  her  study  highlighted  the  required  skills for library professionals and provided effective  services  to  the  users,  so  that  all  the  resources  in  the  library  are  extensively  used.  It  was  found  that  use  of  new  technology  in  design  and  delivering  the  information  product  and  tools  will  also  be  a  best  practice  in  extent  of  use  of  library  services.  Majumdar2  discussed about the various types of skills  required for the library and information professionals  working at IT environment and highlights on different  programmes  to  enhance  these  skills  among  the  professional. Cabonero and Dolendo3  in their study  determined the cataloguing and classification skills  of  academic  and  school  librarians  in  three  area  namely, descriptive cataloguing, subject analysis, and  classification.  Sridhar4   also  carried  out  a  study  on  skill requirements of LIS professionals in the e-world  and found that all pervasive information technology  (e-world) has affected significantly the rendering of  library and information services, but adoption of IT  library services has not been smooth. In addition to  professional knowledge, librarianship is expected to  have some knowledge in the areas of management,  foreign  languages,  statistics,  computer,  etc.  
Any  significant  gap  between  the  knowledge  and  corresponding  skills  required  is  dangerous.  His  paper  cites  various  levels  of  skills  required  by  LIS  professional  and  highlights  the  skills,  starting  from  computer  literacy  to  electronic  publishing  and  marketing.  Taher5   discussed  the  information  storage  and  retrieval  patterns  of  Madrasa  libraries  located  at  Ajmer,  Bangalore,  Hydrabad,  Lucknow,  and Shararanpur; to propose a National Information  Centre  for  Islamic  studies;  to  suggest  way  and  means  for  network  and  resource  sharing  among  different  Madrasa  libraries  and  Islamic  Studies  libraries in India. Koganuramath &  Anagdi6  presented  the  various  facets  of  interpersonal  skills  and  also

by  Jains,  22  governed  by  Muslims,  1  governed  by  Parsee,  2  governed  by  Sikh  minorities.  In  Hooghly  district,  out  of  17  libraries,  Buddhist  governed  libraries  is  1,  Christian  governed  libraries  are  2  and  Muslim  governed  libraries  are  14.  The  only  Persian  community  library  is  in  Kolkata  district.  These  libraries  are  as  follows: 
Terminologically  the  word  ‘minority’  means  the  class, which is smaller. Here minority is considered  with  respect  to  religion.  In  India,  mainly  people  of  five  religions  are  considered  as  minority-the  muslims,  the  christrians,  the  Sikhs,  the  Buddhists  and  Jains.  According  to  census  of  2001,  the  rate  of  population  of  the  Minorities  in  West  Bengal  is  2.34  %.  The  community  which  is  minor  from  the  aspect  of  religion  in  this  study  is  called  minority  community. Indian Government has recognised Muslims,  Christians,  Buddhists,  Jains,  Sikh  and  Parsees  as  minority  communities7.  The  religious  demographic  in  West  Bengal  as  per  census  in  2001  is  Muslims  (25.5  %);  Christrain  (0.64  %);  Buddhist  (0.30  %);  Sikhs(0.08  %);Jains  (0.7  %);  Parsees  (Non-ac- countable). The study cocentrates on in the districts  of  Kolkata  and  Hooghly,  bringing  into  limelight  the  libraries governed by minorities communities in this  part of Bengal. The study covers mainly 50 minority  governed  libraries  in  the  two  districts  of  Bengal,  Kolkata  and  Hooghly,  respectively. 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
• Find  out  the  different  types  of    resources  in  
the  minority  governed  libraries. 
• Find  out  the  type  of  users  using  these  special  
type  of    libraries. 
• Find  out  the  collection,  arrangement  and  
management  of  resources  in  these  libraries. • Know  the  type  of  services  required    in    the   
minority  governed  libraries. 
• Find  out  the  gaps  between  requirement  and  
services  provided  in  the  libraries. 
4.    Met HoDoLogy  
To  get  the  required  information  for  the  study  a  well  structured  questionnaire  was  designed.  The

survey method has been chosen for this work. The  observation  method  and  interview  methods  were  also  taken  into  consideration.    
5. AnALySIS 
5.1  Library collections 
The year of establishment of minority governed  libraries are mentioned in Table 1. According to the  Encyclopedia  of  Library  and  Information  Science,  library collection is the sum total of library materials,  books, manuscripts, periodicals, pamphlets, reports,  recordings, microfilm reels, micro cards and microfiche,  CDs,  etc.,  that  make  up  the  holding  of  a  particular  library. Table 2 represents distribution of resources  in different minority libraries in Kolkata and Hooghly  districts.  These  comprise  such  as  from  the  above  findings,  we  can  compare  the  minority  governed  libraries in the district of Kolkata and Hooghly from  the  point  of  information  about  the  collection  such  as books, periodicals, maps, special collection and  rare books, etc.  It reveals that almost each library  posses a good number of books in their collection.  Each  library  has  some  periodicals  too.  The  main  feature  of  the  minority  libraries  is  that  they  have  good  collection  of  rare  and  historical  books.  The  Zend  Avesta  which  is  the  most  holy  book  of  the  Parsees and very rare in type is found in The Late  Ervad  D.B.  Mehta’s  Zoroastrian  Anjuman  Atash  Adran, Parsee library, which is the only one present  in  Kolkata.  This  is  the  single  copy  collection  in  Kolkata.  Many  of  the  researchers  are  unaware  of  this  information. 
In Kolkata district, it is seen that in 33 libraries,  there  are,  in  total  2,09,663  books.  The  books  comprise of novels, books on science, religion, textual,  references,  children’s,  travels,  etc.  Periodicals  are  present in all the libraries. Rare and historical books  
are  present  in  26  libraries.    In  Hooghly  district,  17  libraries  are  run  by  the  members  of  the  minorities,  and  these  libraries  possess  a  large  number  of  text  book,  religious  books  and  literary  books,  books  on  quiz  and  sciences.  It  is  found  that  Hooghly  district  has  a  rich  collection,  earliest  one  being  Carey Library and Research Centre, with the oldest  book  dating  as  back  as  1800. Among  the  religious  books, there are lots of books on Islamic literature,  Buddha’s biography, William Carey’s biography and  working career, etc. There are in total 85026 books.  The  books  comprise  of  novels,  books  on  religion,  science,  history,  travelogues,  etc.  Periodicals  are  present  in  14  libraries.  Rare  and  historical  books  are  present  in  10  libraries.  
5.2 user  Services offered  in  Libraries 
Users  constitute  the  focal  point  of  any  library.  In  any  library,  user-centered  system  and  services,  including  the  design  and  development  of  services  suited  for  specific  domains  and  specific  groups  of  users,  is  of  utmost  necessity.  It  is  mandatory  in  a  library to allow users to access the library collections.  Library  services  describe  the  facilities  provided  by  a  library  for  the  use  of  books  and  dissemination  of  information.  Table  3  depicts  the  various  kinds  of  services  like  lending  service,  reference  service,  reprographic service, extension service, IT service,  Document  delivery  service,  etc.,  provided  by  the  minority  libraries. 
It  is  seen  that  reference  service  and  lending  service is the most popular service and reprographic  service is the rarest service provided by the different  minority libraries in Kolkata and Hooghly. Extension  service  is  a  special  service  provided  by  these  libraries.  Some  of  the  libraries  are  conducting  motivation  programmes  for  Self-help  roup  (SGH)  for  female  users  in  Hooghly  district.  Table  3  also

Books  and  documents  according  to  the  demand  of the researchers are given in photocopied forms.  Researchers from China, Japan, Australia, America  Germany,  Pakistan,  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  Bhutan  and  Canada  have  come  to  these  libraries  for  their  research  work. The  presence  of  very  old  books  on  Muslim religion is another attraction for Furfura Jafira  Library,  where  lot  of  foreigners  coming  each  year  to avail the information. Out of 50 libraries, female  users are allowed in 16 libraries in Hooghly and 32  libraries  in  metropolitan  city  like  Kolkata.  Female  users  are  not  allowed  in  2  libraries-Suratsingpur  Islimia Pathagar in Hooghly and Hazi Abdulla Library  in  Kolkata.  This  suggests  restriction  of  access  of  female users to the libraries even in a modern city  like  Kolkata. 
From  the  point  of  different  services,  figure  1  shows  that  maximum  numbers  of  libraries  provide  lending  service  and  reference  service  in  Kolkata  and  Hooghly.  Out  of  33  libraries  in  Kolkata,  97  %  of  libraries  provide  reference  services  and  85  %  of  libraries  provide  lending  service  for  their  users;  but 65 % of libraries provide reference service and  94  %  of  libraries  provide  lending  service  out  of  17  libraries  in  Hooghly  district. A  very  interesting  fact  has  been  revealed  that  very  small  percentage  of  libraries provides reprography service and IT services  in both districts. Reprography services are provided  in 18 % minority libraries in Kolkata and in 18 % of

5.3  cataloguing  and  classification  Skills  for  
Information  Processing 
Information resources are useless when access  is not provided. This fundamental function is within  the  concept  of  cataloguing  and  classification  skill.  Thus,  cataloguing  and  classification  are  essential  processes  that  provide  access  to  all  the  acquired  information  resources  of  the  library,  for  it  allows  people to find information needed for their personal  and  professional  growth  and  development.  It  also  provides access to information resources in a way,  that  enables  users  to  find  the  required  information  or resources. Table 4 presents the different physical  forms of catalogues consisting of Book form, sheaf  form,  card  form,  computer  form  etc. Table  4  revels  that out of 17 libraries, 16 libraries maintain proper  cataloguing  system  in  different  physical  form,  and  it  is  very  interesting  that  old  form  or  book  form  is  prevalent till day in following different  edition  these  libraries.  The  above  table  also  shows  that  only  2  libraries  follow  Card  form  cataloguing  system,  and  14 libraries follow Book form of cataloguing system.  This library, though very rich in resources, follows till  date the 11th  edition of DDC. DDC 11 
th 
  rev.  edition  is followed by only one library that is Furfura Jafira  Library  (FJL)  and  19th   edition  is  followed  by  two  libraries  which  are  Dr  Ambedkar  Library  (AL)  and  Hanifia  Dini  Library  (HDL).

is  no  usage  of  computer  catalogue  form  in  any  libraries  of  the  both  district.  Figure  3  reveals  that  there is no usage of DDC 23rd classification scheme  in  libraries  of  both  the  districts.  11th   rev  edition  of  DDC  is  used  in  nine  libraries  (69  %)  in  Kolkata  and  only  in  one  libraries  (34  %)  in  Hooghly.  19th rev  edition  is  followed  in  4  libraries  in  Kolkata  and  in  2  libraries  in  Hooghly. 
6.    concLuSIonS 
From  the  above  discussion  it  may  be  said  that maximum number of libraries are governed by  Muslim community in two districts. The other minority  community governed libraries like Buddhists, Jains,  Parsees,  Sikhs  etc.  are  far  behind.  It  is  found  that  the libraries of Kolkata district have richer collection  than the collection level of Hooghly district libraries.  Rare  books  and  special  collection,  which  often  go  unnoticed  by  the  users,  are  in  these  libraries.  It  is  also observed that the overall infrastructure of these  libraries in both the districts is very poor. They often  do not have their own buildings or the buildings are  in  very  bad  conditions,  the  resources  are  not  well  maintained, the technological skills are meager. The  other skills are tried on by the library professionals,  but  the  various  adverse  conditions  prevent  them  from  exercising  these  skills.  There  is  no  database  of published literature till date regarding the details  of these libraries. The government should instantly  look  at  this,  and  try  to  focus  on  the  development  of  these  libraries.  These  libraries  are  in  very  bad  condition, and often are not revealed to the general  public.  More  and  more  people  should  know  about  these  libraries,  and  then  only  their  resources  be  fully  utilised.
