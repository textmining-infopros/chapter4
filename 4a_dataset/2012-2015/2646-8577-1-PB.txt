ABSTRACT
In the modern techno-savvy era, exponential growth in knowledge increased load on libraries. To cope
up with the dwindling budget and vendors’ closed-access attitude in dealing with proprietary software made
libraries to look for open source software as an alternative. This paper focuses on the general and specific
features of some of the popular software packages of integrated library management software, content
management system and digital library.
Keywords: Open source software, integrated library management software, content management system, digital
library software

1. INTRODUCTION

(a) Proprietary (Commercial) Software

Information technology has transformed the whole
world into a global village. Exponential growth of
knowledge and information made human technologydependent and libraries are not an exception to it. It is
imperative to implement use of certain technology-driven
software to distribute and manage vast information
resources in the libraries. Budgetary provisions in the
libraries do not conform to the pace of technology and
knowledge output to purchase proprietary (commercial)
software and to cope up with its vast data it becomes
costly affair in terms of maintenance, procurement and
purchase. On the other hand philosophy and cost of free/
open source software (FOSS) rightly fit with the
philosophy and needs of the libraries. Therefore it is highly
recommended that libraries should opt for the FOSS.

User has to purchase proprietary software for its use
and in course of time he becomes totally dependent on
the commercial developer and has to pay high cost for its
purchase, maintenance, and improvement. User is unable
to modify software for his own needs, makes him feel
helpless at the mercy of external software.

2. TYPES OF SOFTWARE

(c) Freeware Software

Although in the cyber age freeware, open source, and
shareware are commonly used as synonyms. Actually
there is difference between these terminologies and their
use. Their definitions and differences between them are
stated as follows:

Freeware is the software which can be downloaded,
used and copied without restrictions. No access to the
source code, no community, no development, and no
improvement can be possible.

(b) Shareware Software
Shareware can be downloaded free of cost to try as a
sample, but for the ultimate use, user is supposed to pay
for it. It is developed and released by someone who keeps
full control of the intellectual property. The user does not
have access to the source code and cannot modify it.
There is also no collaboration or community around
shareware.

(d) Free/Open Source Software (FOSS)1
The FOSS or free/libre/open-source software
(FLOSS) is software that is both free software and open
source. It is liberally licensed to grant users the right to
use, copy, study, change, and improve its design through
the availability of its source code rather than its cost. This
approach has gained both momentum and acceptance as
the potential benefits have been increasingly recognised
by both individuals and corporations as free software.
This terminology came from the ideological movement
against proprietary from FSF (Free Software Foundation)
in 1985 and open source from OSI (Open Source Initiative)
in 1998.
The FSF defines free software as software that
respects the following four freedoms to
(i) Run the program, for any purpose.
(ii) Study how the program works, and change it so it
does your computing as you wish. Access to the
source code is a precondition for this.
(iii) Redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour.
(iv) The freedom to distribute copies of your modified
versions to others. Access to the source code is a
precondition for this.

FOSS is an inclusive term that incorporates both the
ideologies of free software and open source software
(OSS), which despite describing similar development
models, have differing in cultures and philosophies. Free
software focuses on the philosophical freedoms it gives to
users, whereas OSS focuses on the perceived strengths
of its peer-to-peer development model. Despite these
differences FOSS is a term that can be used without
particular bias towards either political approach.

3. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AND
LIBRARIES3
Both libraries and open source have same philosophy
i.e., ‘community first’. Blake Carver’s modification4 of
Ranganthan Law is: (i) Software is for use, (ii) Every
computer its user, (iii) Every reader his source code, (iv)
Save the time of the user, and (v) A system is a growing
organism.

3.1 Need of Open Source Software in
Libraries
Following benefits from open source software made it
ideal to use in the libraries:
(i)

Code of software is open to modify, improve, and
redistribute

As per the the OSI, definition2 of open source software
is as follows :

(ii) Mature software

(i)

(iii) Libraries outlive the any software producer or vendor

Free redistribution: The license shall not restrict its
component to use or sell as component of an
aggregate software

(ii) Source code: Must be available through a well
publisised means.
(iii) Derived works: License must be redistributed under
the same terms of original software.
(iv) Integrity of the author’s source code: Original source
code must be maintained. Modified codes can be
assigned different versions and names.
(v) No discrimination against persons or groups
(vi) No discrimination against fields of endeavour: Must
not restrict to use in a specific field.
(vii) Distribution of license applies to anyone receiving the
program
(viii) License must not be specific to a product: Same
rights as those are granted with original software
distributed

(iv) No dependence on vendor or producer
(v) It is more reliable
(vi) Perform better
(vii) More secured
(viii) Use without restriction
(ix) Reduced cost
Thus the philosophy, flexibility, freedom, cost and
continuity of OSS makes this software as an ideal choice
for libraries.

4. OVERVIEW OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
IN LIBRARIES
This paper is focusing on the software coming under
FOSS license and available free to the libraries for its use,
modification and distribution. The researcher has taken
following category of library software under study:

(ix) License must not restrict other software: License
must not restrict the other software must be open
source software

(a) Integrated Library Management Software

(x) License must be technology-neutral

(c) Institutional Repository (Digital Library) Software

382

(b) Content Management System

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(5)

4.1 Integrated Library Management Software

4.2 Content Management System

An integrated library system (ILS)5, also known as a
library management system (LMS) is an enterprise
resource planning system for a library, used to track
items owned, orders made, bills paid, and patrons who
have borrowed usually comprises relational database with
common modules like acquisition, cataloguing,
circulation, serials OPAC, etc. The study discusses in
chart-form some of the widely used open source library
management software in terms of their features and
capabilities. The information furnished in Table 1 and 2 is
taken directly from the software websites and related
weblinks.

Content management system (CMS)19 is a collection
of procedures used to manage work flow in a collaborative
environment. A content management system is used to
manage the content of a website is the fastest way to
keep one’s website content updated. Having a content
management system saves money as a user won’t need
to pay a web developer every time he wants to modify the
content of its website. Some of the popular CMS software
packages are featured in comparison are given in Tables 3
and 4.

4.1.1

Joomla software includes features such as page
caching, RSS feeds, printable versions of pages, news
flashes, blogs, polls, search, and support for language
internationalisation. Drupal offers a sophisticated
programming interface for developers. Mambo includes
advanced features such as page caching to improve
performance on busy sites. WordPress software is also
used for blogging. WordPress also supports the
Trackback and Pingback standards for displaying links to
other sites. TYPO3 is almost completely pluggable,
extensible having complex framework and highly flexible.

Special Features of Selected Integrated
Library Management Software

Koha software is the first open source library
management software widely used all over the world
which provides additional facilities like tagging and RSS
feeds. Its adaptable interface is translated in many
languages. Evergreen software uses SIP2 support for
Interaction. NewGenLib system and PhpMyBibli software
comply with OA institutional repositories to build digital
library. Besides, NewGenLib is Unicode 3.0 compliant
and RFID ready.

4.3 Institutional Repository Software
An institutional repository (IR)26 is an online locus for
collecting, preserving, and disseminating - in digital form the intellectual output of an institution, particularly a
research institution. It preserves digital asset of an
institution by self-archiving research output and gives
open access and global visibility from a single location.

Standards

The number of digital repositories currently in existence
shows that there is both a high demand for digital library
software as well as a need for a new software package to
meet these demands. Most of the digital library software
are based on OAI-PMH model for sharing of metadata
between digital libraries by means of metadata
harvesting. Some of the popular IR software along with
