The paper presents bibliometric analysis of 10671 citations appearing in 471 papers published in  Defence  Science  Journal  (DSJ)  during  2009-2014.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  study  the  productivity  and  citation  patterns  of  researchers  for  their  published  papers  based  on  various  parameters.  The  paper studies the automation process taken place and signifcant changes occurred. The study reveals  almost  a  constant  trend  of  infow  of  papers  with  increasing  trend  of  multi-authored  papers.  Highest  share  of  papers  are  being  contributed  by  authors  of  Indian  origin,  majority  being  from  DRDO,  and  journals  being  the  predominant  source  of  information  cited  by  the  researchers  for  their  R&D  works.

1. InTroduCTIon  
Journals are considered a predominant channel  of communication among researchers for their R&D  activities  on  a  global  basis.  They  are  taken  as  a  primary source to explore the productivity and citation  patterns  of  researchers  through  their  published  research  papers  in  specific  subject  fields.  There   are a large number of journals published in almost  every subject field in India. Defence Science Journal  
•

(DSJ) is a unique bi-monthly, multi-disciplinary primary  
defence research journal of Defence Research and  Development  Organisation  (DRDO),  Ministry  of  Defence,  Government  of  India,  published  by  the  Defence  Scientific  Information  and  Documentation  Centre  (DESIDOC),  Delhi  since  1949.  The  journal  covers basic and applied research and review papers  
applications,  both  from  India  and  abroad. 
from  academic  and  research  institutions  including  defence R&D institutions, having bearing on defence

1.1  Changing  Trends  of  dSJ  
The DSJ has undergone many changes since its  
inception from 1949 till today. From the year 2007,  
the  Journal  started  using  Open  Journal  System  (OJS) software to further speed up the editorial and  
refereeing  processes  thereby  reducing  by  half  the  time taken from submission to acceptance of papers.  The authors and referees register themselves on the  
Journals website and are able to track the progress  of papers, online1.  Using  OJS,  a  user  can  register  as  a  reader,  an  author,  and  as  a  referee.  
Readers  can  view  abstract  as  well  as  full  text  paper of all the issues available at the DSJ site.  Readers are asked to sign up for the 'publishing  notification'  service  for  DSJ.  They  can  use  the  'Register'  link  at  the  top  of  the  homepage  for  the  journal.  The  registered  reader  will  receive  the  'Table  of  Contents'  by  e-mail  for  each  new  issue  of  the  journal.  
Authors  are  required  to  register  for  submitting  manuscripts online and for checking the status  of  current  submissions.  The  authors  get  auto  acknowledgement  through  OJS  and  can  also  track the progress of their manuscript online. The  information  regarding  acceptance/modification/  rejection of the manuscript is sent to the authors  through OJS. The authors  submit the modified  manuscript  online  through  OJS.  
One can register as a referee, giving details about  his/her areas of expertise along with his name,  affiliation, e-mail, etc. A database of referees is  maintained through OJS. The title and abstract  of the manuscript submitted by the authors are  sent  through  OJS  to  the  referees  selected  as  per their areas of expertise, and after confirming  their  availability  and  willingness  to  review  the  manuscript,  the  complete  manuscript  is  sent  them with a request to give their comments on  the 'Confidential Review Report Performa' which  the  reviewer  sends  back  using  OJS.  This  has  considerably reduced the time in the refereeing  process2.

LITerATure  revIew 
Bibliometric  studies  of  journals  has  remained  a  key  methodology  to  measure  productivity  of  researchers,  information  sources  used  or  cited  by  them,  institutions,  countries  or  any  other  level  of  performance  during  a  specific  period  of  time.  In  India alone, a large number of bibliometric studies of  several journals based on citation analysis have been  carried out by many researchers during the last two  decades. For instance, Mete and Deshmukh4  analysed  1824  citations  appeared  in  202  papers  published  in  Annals  of  Library  Science  and  Documentation  published during 1984-1993.Vij & Bedi5   carried  out  a  bibliometric  study  of  the  contents  and  citations  of  papers  published  in  Defence  Science  Journal  during 1987-1996. Narang6  conducted a bibliometric  study  and  analysed  8396  citations  appeared  in  
356 
736  papers  published  in  Indian  Journal  of  Pure  and Applied Mathematics  during 1998-2002. Jena 
7 made  a  bibliometric  study  of  the Indian  Journal  of  Fibre and Textile Research, wherein 8114 citations  from  507  papers  published  during  1996-2004  were  analysed  through  citation  patterns.  Other  studies  undertaken are by Kumar & Kumar8   who  analysed  8093  citations  from  various  papers  published  in  Journal  of  Oil  Seed  Research  during  1993-2004.  Kulkarni9,  et  al.  conducted  citation  analysis  of  papers published in Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical  Education  and  Research   during  1996-2006  and  found  journals  as  the  leading  information  source  of  citations  preferred  by  authors.  
Verma  &  Tamrakar10   conducted  bibliometric  analysis  of  524  papers  published  in  the  Defence  Science  Journal   during  1997-2006.  Hadimani  &  Rajgoli11  analysed 10553 citations appeared in 538  papers published in Applied Engineering in Agriculture  during 2004-2008 and found authorship pattern and  ranked list of information sources cited by authors,  besides many other patterns. Recently, Deshmukh12 analysed 4141 citations appended to papers published  in Annals of Library and Information Studies  during  1997-2010  and  found  that  journals  were  the  most  cited  information  sources  by  the  authors  for  their  research works. Kumar & Moorthy13  analysed 3428  citations appeared in 271 papers published in DESIDOC  Journal  of  Library  and  Information  Technology during  2001-2010,  based  on  various  parameters,  like  authorship  pattern,  productive  pattern,  citation  pattern,  etc.  Bansal14   conducted  a  comprehensive  bibliometric study involving 5416 citations appeared  in  391  papers  published  in  DESIDOC  Journal  of  Library & Information Technology  during 2001-2012.  The  analysis  provided  growth  pattern,  authorship  pattern,  geographic  distribution  pattern,  subject  pattern, length pattern and citation pattern of papers  published in the Journal. Garg & Anjana15  analysed  13738  citations  appended  to  605  papers  published  in  Journal  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights   during  1996-2012.The bibliometric study analysed various  patterns, like productive pattern, authorship pattern,  institution based pattern, prolific authors pattern and  citation  pattern  of  papers  published  in  the  journal.  The  present  paper  makes  a  bibliometric  study  of  10671  citations  appended  to  471  papers  published  in Defence  Science  Journal   during  2009-2014.

AImS And  obJeCTIveS 
Journals  are  the  key  channels  or  media  of  communication  among  researchers  all  over  the  world. The present study is aimed at conducting in- depth study of the productivity and citation patterns  of  researchers  as  reflected  through  their  papers  published in DSJ during 2009-2014. The study has  been  carried  out  with  the  following  objectives: 

========2========

SINGH: STUDY OF PRODUCTIVITY, CITATION PATTERNS AND CHANGING TRENDS IN DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL 
(a) To study the productive pattern of papers published  
in  DSJ  based  on  such  parameters  as,  growth  
pattern, authorship pattern institutions pattern and  
nationality  pattern  as  exhibited  by  authors. (b) To  study  the  citation  pattern  of  researchers  
for  their  papers  published  in  DSJ  based  on  
such parameters as, quantum pattern, currency  
pattern,  information  sources  pattern,  journals  
pattern  as  followed  by  authors. 
(c)  To  understand  the  changing  trends  in  DSJ. 
4.   m eThodoLogy  
For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  DSJ  has  been  selected as the source journal. To observe consistency  in results of the study on a longitudinal basis, papers  published during the six-year period (2009-2014) are  taken  into  consideration  for  bibliometric  analysis.  Study  is  done  regarding  Indian/foreign  authors,  author(s) affiliations (name of organisation, country),  number of cited references, country of foreign cited  references,  period  of  cited  references,  etc.  Finally,  
and the minimum are published by 201 researchers  in  2012  (13.80  %).  In  other  years,  the  productivity  of  the  journal  remains  almost  constant.  It  may  be  mainly due to the strict peer review policy followed  by the publishing agency in order to maintain quality  standard  of  the  journal. 
5.2 Authorship-based  Productivity  Pattern 
Table 2 shows the authorship-based productivity  pattern of researchers for their papers published in  DSJ  during  2009-2014.  As  seen  in  Table  2,  two- authored papers comprised the highest percentage  i.e. 127 (26.96 %), followed by three-authored papers,  119 (25.26 %), four-authored, 94 (19.96 %), five or  more  authored,  67  (14.23  %)  and  single-authored,  64  (13.59  %).  This  indicates  that  proportion  of  two  or  multi-authored  papers  published  in  DSJ  is  quite  large  (86.41  %)  compared  to  single-authored  papers  (13.59  %). 
5.3  Institution-based  Productivity  Pattern 
Table 3 shows the institution-based productivity  
the  data  was  analysed  for  exploring  various  types  
pattern of research output or papers published in DSJ  
of  productivity  and  citation  patterns  of  researchers  of  their  published  papers. 
5.   r eSuLTS And  dISCuSSIonS 
All  the  papers  published  in  DSJ  during  2009- 2014  have  been  physically  scanned  to  analyse  their  contents  and  citations.  In  all,  471  papers,  comprising  of  10671  citations,  authored  by  1386  researchers published in DSJ during 2009-2014. The  analysis of the productivity and citation patterns of  researchers for their papers published in DSJ during  2009-2014 based on various parameters, as stated  in  the  objectives,  are  presented  as  under: 
5.1   g rowth-based  Productivity  Pattern 
Table  1  presents  the  data  on  growth-based  productive  pattern  of  papers  published  by  the  
during 2009-2014. The share of papers published in  DSJ during 2009-2014 is contributed predominantly  by  R&D  laboratories/institutions  of  DRDO  (38.16  %),  followed  by  Indian  academic  institutions,  IITs  (33.64  %),  foreign  academic  and  R&D  institutions  (18.70  %)  and  Indian  civilian  R&D  institutions,  like  CSIR,  ICAR,  BARC,  ISRO,  etc.  (9.50  %).  The  possible  reasons  for  more  papers  contributed  by  DRDO  institutions  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that,  (a)  DSJ is a primary channel for exchange of information  among  defence  scientists  working  in  DRDO  and,  (b)  its  scope  provides  fast  communication  among  researchers  by  way  of  publishing    Special  Issues   on  areas  of  defence  interest. 
5.4   n ationality-based  Productivity  Pattern  
Table  4  presents  the  data  on  nationality-based  
researchers  and  no.  of  researchers  publishing  in  
productivity  pattern  of  research  output  or  papers  
DSJ  during  the  period,  2009-2014. 
In all, 471 papers are published by 1386 researchers  in the DSJ during 2009-2014. Maximum papers are  published  by  261  researchers  in  2013  (18.90  %)  Table 1.  growth-based productivity pattern of dSJ during

Based  on  complete  count  of  papers,  as  shown  in Table 4, 1386 authors or researchers contributed  papers  for  DSJ  during  2009-2014.  Among  them,  majority  of  authors  (81.67  %)  are  from  India  and  the  remaining  authors  (18.33  %)  are  from  abroad  like  USA,  China,  Russia,  Czech,  Germany,  Israel,  Australia,  etc.  From  this,  it  is  evident  that  DSJ  is  the most popular channel of communication among  researchers on areas of research relevant to defence  in India and to a considerable extent for researchers  geographically  spread  all  over  the  world.
