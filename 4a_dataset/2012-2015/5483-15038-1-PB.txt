AbStRAct 
The main objective of this present study is to provide a detailed usage statistics of the Kuvempu  University library portal during the academic year 2011-2012. The study examined the usage of library  portal by research scholars, and faculty members of various science departments of Kuvempu University.  The  study  investigated,  and  observed  the  factors  like  attitude  and  perception  towards  library  portal,  purpose  of  use,  benefts  of  using  the  library  portal. The  study  also  identifed  the  diffculties  faced  by  respondents while using the library portal. The study shows that 85 % of respondents used the library  portal.  Research  is  the  major  reason  for  which  majority  (70  %)  of  respondents  use  the  library  portal.  75 % of the respondents opined that the portal has provided more effcient access to electronic resources  (e-resources). 48.33 % of respondents have partially agreed with the information refected on the main  page  of  the  portal.  Low  speed  connectivity  is  a  major  problem  found  from  this  study.  Based  on  the  fndings, the study suggests: proper training to the users as well as library staff, marketing of resources  and services through advertisements, and display of printed guides, announcements of new e-resources,  more high–speed computers for further improvement of library portal. This study would assist the library  administrators in developing a more complete understanding of users information needs.

1. IntRodUctIon  
Information  is  considered  as  product.  It  is  saleable, and there is a constant market for it. Like  all  other  products,  to  be  saleable,  information  has  to  be  what  the  customer  want  and  in  a  form  that  they can easily use. It is also self-regenerating i.e.  having given/sold it the giver/seller and the recipient  both  retains  it,  and  this  process  can  on  forever.  In  the  age  of  information  technology  (IT)  information  seekers  do  not  wish  to  spend  their  most  of  time  in  searching  information.  Information  generators  (authors,  associations,  publishers,  government,  institutes,  researchers,  etc.)  want  to  marke  their  products/intellectual properties. Libraries, information  centers, data warehouses keen to provide access and  marketing  (awareness)  of  their  resources  for  their  users/clients/stakeholder. For all above aspects, the  portal is like a boon for an individual or community  of group. Basic concept behind the portal technology  is  to  save  the  time  of  information  seekers  while  searching  their  require  information.  Thus,  portal

is  playing  an  important  role  as  an  agent,  which  transforms  the  library  into  a  leaning  organisation  between actual users and library resources1. Library  portals  are  a  sub-set  of  web  portals  which  are  organised  gateways  that  help  to  structure  access  to  information  found  on  the  internet2. 
In this study attempt has been made to examine  the  level  of  usage  of  library  portal  by  research  scholars and faculty members of various departments  under the faculty of science at Kuvempu University.  Further, the study intended to investigate the attitude  and  perception  towards  library  portal  of  Kuvempu  University.

It is found that,  77.5  %  of  respondents  accessed  the  library  portal  in  their  department  only  (Fig.  1). 
7.3 Purpose  of  Using  Library  Portal 
The purpose of using library portal differs from  one user to another. The users may use the library  portal for various purposes such as, research work,  to  find  reference  information,  to  use  e-jounal  and  databases,  to  download  full-text  articles,  etc. 
Table  3  reveals  the  purpose  for  which  the  library  portal  is  being  used.  The  breakdown  of  analysis  shows  that  majority  of  Research  Scholars  (43.33  %)  used  the  library  portal  obviously  for  research purpose followed by use of e-journals and  download  full-text  articles  (16.66  %  each).  
It can be observed from the above analysis that  
It  is  noted  that  there  are  different  locations  70  %  of  respondents  use  the  library  portal  for  the  for  accessing  the  library  portal  such  as  within  the  purpose  of  research  activities.  Further,  research  library,  in  department,  in  hostel,  in  cyber  cafes,  at  being  an  important  endeavor  in  any  university  home  and  so  on.  The  response  of  the  research  and  library  as  catalyst  for  supporting  all  of  its  scholars and faculty members about accessing the  activities,  it  is  necessary  to  made  available  the  
library  portal  was  tabulated. 
It is visible that 7 (11.66 %) research scholars accessed  the library portal within the library building, followed by 44  (73.33 %)  in the department, 5 (8.33 %) in the hostel,  1  (1.66  %)  in  cyber  cafes,  and  3  (5  %)  accessed  at  their  home.  
Further  the  study  also  indicates  that  4  (6.66  %)  faculty  members  accessed  the  library

7.4 Use  of  Resources  and  Services 
A  library  being  a  service  oriented  institution  it  offers  different  sources  and  services  for  its  users  in order to fulfill their requirements. Users may use  these  sources  and  services  by  visiting  the  library  or  by  using  its  portal.  Some  of  the  resources  and  services  available  through  the  university  library  portal  are  listed  under  this  study  and  respondents  were  requested  to  indicate  the  usage  of  sources  and  services  and  their  frequency. 
Table  4  indicates  use  of  resources  available  through  library  portal.  It  is  evident  from  the  table  that  research  scholars  and  faculty  members  were  highly  satisfied  with  the  ease  of  use  of  sources  available  through  library  portal.

9. SUggeStIonS 
Based  on  the  findings,  the  study  made  the  following  suggestions  for  further  improvement  of  library  portal.  
• Proper  training  should  be  provided  for  faculty  
members for using the resources and services offered  
through the library portal by means of conducting  
orientation  programmes  from  time  to  time.  • More high–speed computers/terminals should be made  
available  in  the  library  for  better  access. • Adequate  training  should  be  provided  for  the  
library  staff  for  updating  and  maintaining  the  
library  portal.  
• Announcements  should  be  made  by  the  library  
about  the  availability  of  new  e-resources  or  
additions  of  new  databases  for  the  users  of  
the  library.  
• Library should provide the facilities for the user  
to get familiar with resources subscribed by the  
library.  
•   s pecial  training  programs  should  be  organised  
for  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  to  
enhance usage level of resources and services  
so  that  users  can  access  and  use  the  relevant  
information  effectively.  
• Problems  related  to  slow  connectivity  should  
be  overcome  by  upgrading  the  bandwidth  of  
the  internet.

needed  information.  They  also  pointed  out  the  need  for  updating  the  portal  by  way  of  inclusion  of  new  resources  from  time  to  time.  At  the  same  time  the  study  also  pointed  out  need  for  more  terminals  with  high  bandwidth  for  speedy  access  to  resources  through  the  portal.  Finally,  most  of  the  respondents  are  of  the  opinion  that  the  library  has  to  conduct  orientation  and  short  term  training  programme  for  increasing  the  level  of  awareness  and  use  of  library  portal.
