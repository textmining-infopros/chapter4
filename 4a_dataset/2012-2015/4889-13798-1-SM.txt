3. LITeRATURe  RevI ew 
Review of literature happens to be an important  segment  of  the  concerned  topic.  In  this  study  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  cover  few  works  which  have been undertaken in India and abroad. Hussain  &  Kumar1   carried  out  a  survey  the  use,  collection  and  services  of  IIRS  library.  The  major  findings  of  the  study  were: 
• A  majority  of  the  users  (41.25  %)  of  the  IIRS  
library  use  the  library  services  daily.  • Majority  of  the  respondents  mainly  used  the  
users  rated  library  collection,  services  and  attitude  of  library  staff  was  good.  However,  the  users  were  not  satisfied  with  the  photocopying  services.  
Unomah5   carried  out  a  study  about  student  utilisation  of  academic  libraries  in  Nigeria.    The  important  findings  of  the  study  were: 
• Most  of  the  students  found  their  lecture  notes  
sufficient  and  felt  there  was  no  need  to  read  
textbooks.  On  borrowing,  68  %  had  no  books  
on  loan.  
• On  use  of  leisure  time,  most  of  the  faculty  
members  do  not  promote  student  use  of  the  
library  that  is,  76  %  of  the  students  said  their  
lectures  did  not  give  them  reading  lists.  The  
students  were  not  equally  given  any  guidance  
by  faculty  as  to  the  use  of  the  library  and  
resource  materials. 
4.    MeT hoDoLogy 
Questionnaire and personal interview methods were  used for data collection. There were approximately  1000 users available in NIT. 196 questionnaires were  administered  and  178  filled  in  questionnaires  were  obtained  from  the  faculty  members  and  students.  Out  of  178  questionnaires,  only  170  (95.51  %)  
(81.25  %). 
• Most of the respondents preferred print collection.  
(36.50  %)  were  using  electronic  collection,  of  
them  (68.75  %)  were  using  CD-ROM,  further  
86.25 % respondents used library networks for  
current  periodicals.  
Naushad Ali2  focused the purpose of study that  the use of electronic information services (EIS) among  the users of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)  Delhi library. The study found that Boolean logic and  truncation are the most often used search facilities  by  IIT  users.  Lack  of  printing  facilities,  terminals  and  trained  staff  are  the  major  reasons  that  would  discourage  users  from  accessing  the  EIS.  Rajeev  & Amritpal3   in  their  study  found  the  following:  • Majority of the respondents has more than two  
year  experience  of  using  the  internet  and  use  
the  internet  services  daily  
• Most  frequently  used  places  for  accessing  
internet  is  the  college  (90  %)  and  followed  by  
home  (23.3  %) 
• E-mail service is the most preferred service by  
all  the  internet  users. 
All the respondents face the problem of insufficient  time  slot  allotted  to  per  user  in  the  college  for  internet use. Singh4  analysed the emergence of IIT  Kanpur.  She  discussed  the  methodology  used  for  
library  to  borrow  books  and  other  materials  
questionnaires  were  selected  for  analysis  of  data  
and 8 (4.49 %) questionnaires were rejected because  
of incomplete response from the respondents. Data  collected  from  the  questionnaries  were  analysed  using  frequency  counts  and  simple  percentage. 
5.  ANALySIS AND   F INDINgS 
There  are  large  numbers  of  users  and  they  range from undergraduates (Ug) to faculty members.              A sample from all categories of users was taken to  find  out  their  opinion  about  the  services  provided  by the library. 52.36 % of the total population under  study consists of undergraduates, 20 % postgraduates  (Pg), 14.12 % of those working research scholars,  13.52  %  of  those  are  using  faculty  members.  The  size  of  the  sample  chosen  for  study  is  quite  large  so  that  the  formalities  of  finding  can  be  facilitated  (Table  1).

5.4  Infrastructural  Facilities 
Users’ satisfactions with infrastructure facilities  are important because reader’s dissatisfaction means  that  the  service  provided  by  the  library  is  not  upto  the standard. In order to promote the use of books  it  is  advisable  to  have  a  functional  building  with  provision  for  pleasant,  natural  and  electrical  light,  soothing interior, good-looking furniture, comfortable  chairs  and  other  such  facilities.  They  increase  the  use of books. Table 4 reveals that 136 (80 %) users  are  satisfied  with  infrastructure  facilities  available  of the library as furniture’s, while 119 (70 %) users  are  satisfied  with  lighting  facilities.  Followed  by  
preparation of competitive examination. Followed by  
102  (60  %)  users  are  satisfied  with  ventilation,  
while  90  (52.94  %)  of  the  users  are  satisfied  with 
39 (22.94 %) visiting library for academic purpose,  while  34  (20  %)  visit  library  for  other  purpose.  further  followed  by  27  (15.88  %)  users  visit  for  recreational purpose, whereas only 17 (10 %) users  to  use  reference  and  information  services.

It was requested to the users to give suggestions  for improvements or any problems they faced while  using  the  library  facilities  or  services. Accordingly,  users’  suggestions  are  listed  as:  
• To make an arrangement to endow with nascent  
information  to  the  users. 
• Access  to  every  document  in  a  library  should  
be  possible  through  OPACs. 
•   l ibrary should arrange more multiple copies of  
library for professional development, which indirectly  helps  the  society  by  way  of  publishing.  However,  most  of  the  users  use  books,  CD-ROMs  etc.  This  indicates  that  they  are  interested  in  increasing  their  overall  knowledge.  For  searching,  they  use  controlled  vocabulary,  which  indicates  that  they  have  been  educated  by  the  library  professionals  for  use  of  online  databases.  They  are  very  much  satisfied with the facilities and the services provided  by the library. It has been observed that the faculty  members, research scholars, Pgs and Ugs students  in tend together information and make an attempt to  keep themselves abreast to latest information. The  present  study  does  not  fully  authenticate  that.
