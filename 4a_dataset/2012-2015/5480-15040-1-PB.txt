 The paper presents citation analysis of PhD theses submitted in the discipline of sociology of the  University of Delhi during 1995-2010. The study is based on the 5766 citations taken out from 25 PhD  theses of sociology. The study presents analysis of several parameters like authorship pattern, forms of  literature, country-wise scattering of citations, distribution of Indian and foreign citations and a ranked list  of top 30 cited sociology journals. The study fnds that highest number of citations was single authored  (83.94 %), and 67.23 % citations were from books and only 22.20 % citations were from journals. The  country-wise  scattering  of  citations  reveals  that  2536  (45.52  %)  citations  were  from  India  and  it  was  
followed by USA and UK.

1. INTrODUCTION 
Citation analysis is an indirect method to assess  the information/sources used by various categories  of  users.  Citation  analysis  is  a  worthwhile  area  of  research  and  refers  to  references  in  one  text  to  another  text,  with  information  on  where  that  text  can  be  found.  Citation  analysis  is  useful  for  understanding subject relationships, authorship pattern,  impact, publication trends, and so on. With citation  analysis  one  can  evaluate  and  interpret  citations  received by articles, authors, institutions, and other  indications  of  scientific  activity.  Citation  analysis  is  a  major  area  of  bibliometric  research,  which  uses  various  methods  of  citation  analysis  to  establish  relationships  between  authors  or  their  work1.  
The present study analyses the citations appended  in  the  theses  of  sociology,  accepted  by  University  of  Delhi  during  1995-2010.  Sociology  is  the  study  of  human  social  life.  It  is  an  area  which  uses  various  methods  of  empirical  investigation  and  critical  analysis  to  develop  a  body  of  knowledge  about  human  social  activity2.  Sociology  enables  us  to  understand  the  structure  and  dynamics  of  society,  and  their  intricate  connections  to  patterns  of  human  behavior  and  individual  life  changes.  It  examines  the  ways  in  which  the  forms  of  social  structure-groups, organisations, communities, social  categories  such  as  class,  sex,  age,  or  race,  and  various social institutions such as kinship, economic,  political, or religious affect human attitudes, actions,  and  opportunities3.  
2. LITErATUrE rEVIEW 
Various  studies  have  been  carried  out  on  citation analysis. For the present study the following  studies have been reviewed in the light of the topic.  Zafrunnisha4   found  that  foreign  journals  were  the  most cited sources as compared to Indian journals.  In authorship pattern collaborative authorship is high  as  compared  to  single  authored  papers. 
Jadhav5, et al.  in their study reveals that books  were  most  cited  documents  1549  (29.39  %),  and  maximum number 3675 (62.61 %) of citations were  from  India.  It  was  found  that  single  authorship  is  dominant.  Jan6   found  that  books  received  more  citations  as  compared  to  journals,  and  female  (52.34  %)  contributed  more  than  male  (47.66  %).  Deshmukh7   reveals  that  journals  were  the  most  cited form of literature. In authorship pattern single  authored  papers  dominated  over  other  type  of  authorship.  
Chikate & Patil1  in their study reveal that journal  articles  were  found  highly  cited  followed  by  books,  and  web  resources,  and  single  authored  papers  were  highly  cited.  Pillai8   observed  that  journal  articles  were  found  to  be  the  most  frequently  cited  bibliographic  items.  USA  was  the  leading  cited  country  and  Elsevier  Science  is  the  leading  cited  publisher. Okiy9  found that most students in education  used  more  textbooks  (60.3  %),  than  other  forms  of  documents.

Harwade  &  Dankhade10   in  their  bibliographic  form-wise distribution of citations showed that books  accounted  for  42.77  %  of  citations,  followed  by  journals (32.81 %), PhD theses (14.70 %), newspapers  (4.50  %)  and  others  (5.22  %).  The  results  also  revealed  that  the  single  authored  papers  were  the  highest  in  number  and  half-life  period  for  journals  was  found  to  be  22  years.  Buttlar11   observed  that  about 80 % of the citations were of single authored  papers,    also  journal  articles  were  cited  more  than  books,  book  chapters,  proceedings,  theses,  and  other print resources. The most cited journals were  College  &  Research  Libraries   and  Journal  of  the  American  Society  for  Information  Science.  
3. ObJECTIVES  OF  THE  STUDY 
The main purpose of the study was the citation  analysis of PhD theses in the discipline of sociology  submitted  to  University  of  Delhi  during  1995-2010.  The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to:    
• Study  the  principal  form  of  literature  used  by  
the  researchers  
• Study  the  country  wise  scattering  of  citations  • Study  the  distribution  of  citations  according  to  
city  of  publication 
• Identify  the  leading  publishers 
• Determine  the  age  of  distribution  of  literature  
used  by  the  Sociology  researchers  
• Prepare  a  list  of  core  journals  in  sociology • Study the authorship pattern of cited references,  
and  
• Know  the  ratio  of  cited  Indian  author  citations  
to  foreign  author  citations  used  by  the  Indian  
sociology  researchers. 
4. METHODOLOGY 
Data for the present study consists of 25 theses  submitted to Department of Sociology, University of  Delhi during 1995-2010. All the references listed in  these  theses  were  noted  down  from  each  thesis  by  the  researchers  on  a  specified  ‘data  capturing  sheet’  designed  for  this  purpose.  The  collected  references were thoroughly analysed and segregated  into  the  different  categories  of  documents  such  as  books, journal articles, conference papers, reports,  theses/dissertations,  etc.  Each  reference  made  at  one  time  has  been  counted  as  one  citation.  If  the  same  reference  was  repeated  using  ‘ibid’  or  ‘op  cit’,  it  has  been  counted  again.  The  information  relating  to  each  citation,  i.e.,  number  of  authors,  bibliographic  form,  name  of  the  journal,  subject,  country  of  origin,  language,  name  of  the  publisher,  and  the  availability  of  references  in  the  library  concerned.  A  total  of  5766  citations  were  found  in  all  the  25  PhD  theses.  The  data  was  compiled  
490 
and  analysed  using  mS-Excel  software.  Finally,  a  list of core journals was compiled and prepared on  the  basis  of  highly  cited  articles  of  the  journals  in  sociology.  Name  of  cited  authors  were  classified  into  Indian/foreign  citations,  which  were  identified  by  the  name  of  the  authors.  
5.   r ESULTS AND  DISCUSSIONS 
5.1 Forms  of  Literature  Used  by  research  
Scholars 
Table  1  shows  distribution  of  different  forms  of  cited literature used by the sociology researchers in  their doctoral theses. Analysis of data indicates that  books contributed to the highest number (67.2 %) of  citations  followed  by  journal  articles  (22.2  %),  and  book  chapters  (4.3  %).  Rest  of  the  citations  were  scattered  in  several  other  document  types. Among  the rest, reports and conference papers were cited  more  as  compared  to  other  document  sources.

Hence,  the  study  concludes  that  Sociology  researchers  used  books  mostly  for  their  research  work.  The  study  also  indicates  that  web-resources  did  not  get  any  citation. 
5.2 Country-wise  Scattering  of  Citations 
To explore the scattering of the citations according  to  the  country,  the  authors  have  used  the  country  of  publication  of  the  source  item  as  the  basis  of  citation. 
Analysis  of  data  indicates  that  5766  citations  were  scattered  in  publications  that  were  published  from  more  than  30  countries.  Among  them,  India  ranked first with 45.98 % citations followed by USA  (26.81  %)  and  UK  (22.42  %).  Publications  from  these countries received about 95 % of the citations  and  only  5  %  citations  were  from  the  remaining  countries  (Table  2).

5.3 City-wise  Scattering  of  Citations 
Similar to the country-wise distribution of citations,  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  identify  the  top  ten  cities  of  the  world  in  terms  of  contribution  of  citations.  It  indicates  that  New  Delhi  ranked  first  having  24.48  %  citations  followed  by  London  with  11.47  %  and  New  York  with  8.75  %.  City-wise  publications listed in Table 3 constitute about 61 %  of  citations.

5.4 Publisher-wise  Scattering  of  Citations  
The publishers-wise analysis of citations shows  that  more  than  100  publishers  were  involved  in  publishing the 5766 citations. Table 4 listed only top  10 publishers with 1458 citations. It is viewed from  the  table  that  Oxford  University  press  ranked  first  with  440  publications  (30.17  %)  followed  by  Sage  publications  with  200  publications  (13.71  %),  and  Cambridge  University  press  with  184  publications  (12.62  %).  A  surprising  finding  of  the  study  was  that in spite of the major citations received from the  
Indian publications, the Delhi-based Vikas Publishing  House was the only publisher which could find place  among  the  top  ten  publishing  houses.

5.5 Age-wise  Distribution  of  Literature 
Table  5  shows  the  distribution  of  literature  by  age.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  maximum  numbers  of  citations  (28.52  %)  were  from  the  publications  published during the period of 1998-1989, followed  by  the  year  1988-1979  with  26.48  %  citations  and  1978-1969 with 17.91 % citations. The median age  of  the  citations  is  2.05.

5.6   r anking  of  Core  Journals  in  Sociology 
The  ranked  list  of  core  journals  as  reflected  in  the citations is presented in Table 6. It is observed  that  researchers  in  Sociology  have  cited  a  total  of  209  journals.  From  which  only  21  journals,  in  which  the  frequency  of  occurrence  is  least  10,  are  listed  in  the  table.  The  study  finds  that  top  two  journals namely, Economic & Political Weekly   with  137  (10.70  %)  and  Indian  Journal  of  Psychiatry with  98  (7.66  %)  are  from  India,  which  shows  that  articles  from  these  two  journals  are  highly  cited,

5.7 Authorship  Pattern  of  Citations 
Authorship pattern has been analysed to determine  the percentage of authors in single, two, three and  four & above authors. Some of the documents such  as newspapers, interviews do not have authors, so  they  are  categorised  as  not  given  in  the  Table  7.

5.8  Indian  Author  Citations  to  Foreign  Author  
Citations ratio 
To  explore  the  distribution  of  Indian  author  citations  to  foreign  author’s  citations  the  authors  were  classified  into  Indian  authors  and  foreign  author  citations  based  on  the  name  of  the  author.  The  study  finds  that  65.42  %  citations  are  from  foreign  authors,  while  34.58  %  citations  are  from  Indian  authors.

So,  it  can  be  concluded,  that  foreign  authored  citations  are  more  as  compare  to  Indian  authors. 
6. FINDINGS  AND   CONCLUSIONS 
In the present study 5766 citations were analysed  from  25  PhD  theses  in  sociology.  On  the  basis  of  the  above  study  the  following  conclusions  are  drawn:  
• Highest  numbers  of  citations  (67.2  %)  were  
recorded from books followed by journal articles,  
book  chapters,  encyclopedias,  reports,  etc.  • Analysis on distribution of country-wise scattering  
of citations reveals that Indian literature received  
(45.9 %) citations and ranked first, followed by  
USA  with  1546  (26.8  %),  and  UK  with  1293  
(22.4  %).  
• Similar  to  scattering  by  country,  analysis  on  
scattering by city shows that New Delhi ranked  
first having 39.9 % citations followed by London  
with  18.7  %,  and  New  York  14.3  %  citations.  • The analysis of authorship pattern in Sociology  
theses reveals that 83.9 % of citations were to  
papers written by single authors, which implies  
that  social  sciences  are  less  collaborative  as  
compared  to  science  and  technology. 
• The  analysis  of  citations  indicates  that  most  
cited authors in the theses are foreign authored  
65.4  %,  and  citations  to  Indian  authors  are  
about  34.6  %. 
• In the rank list of journals, India’s  Economic  &  
Political Weekly  occupies the first rank accounting  
for 137 (10.70 %) of total journal citations followed  
by Indian  Journal  of  Psychiatry   (7.66  %).  
During  the  study  it  was  found  that  citations

place.  This  kind  of  study  will  definitely  help  the  libraries  in  selection  of  useful  sources  as  there  is  explosion  of  information  and  documents  in  the  form  of  books  and  journals.  The  ranking  of  journals can be used by librarians and researchers  to select the journals of greater importance in a  particular  subject  area.
