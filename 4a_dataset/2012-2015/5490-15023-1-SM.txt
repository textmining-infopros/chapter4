AbstrAct 
 This paper reviews research that has been done on the information needs and use of health care  providers around the world. The paper focuses on different types of professionals in the medical feld such  as  medical  faculty  members,  general  practitioners,  nursing  professionals,  family  physicians,  clinicians,  etc. The growth of research and developmental (R&D) activities in the medical and health-care, resulted  many changes in all the feld of Medicine. The health-care professionals need up-to-date information to  serve the society in a better way. The fndings of the studies are organised into the main headings like  
information needs and information use. 
Keywords: Information needs, information use, health-care, medical professionals, healthcare providers,  
medical faculty members, medical information system 
1. INtrODUctION 
Human knowledge is passing through the phases  like  preservation,  transmission  and  advancement.  The  continuous  adding  of  new  knowledge  to  the  existing  knowledge  makes  possible  progress  in  and  all  areas  of  the  disciplines.  The  review  of  the  theoretical  and  research  literature  is  the  first  step  of  research  pursuit.  The  term  ‘review  of  literature’  consists  of  two  words:  Review  and  literature.  The  word  ‘review’  means  the  analysis  and  synthesis  of  the  available  knowledge  of  the  field  in  a  unique  way to provide the rationale for the study. The word  ‘literature’  refers  to  the  knowledge  of  a  particular  area of investigation of any discipline which includes  theoretical,  practical  and  its  research  studies. 
According to Borg & Gall1, the review of literature  involves locating, reading and evaluating reports of  research  as  well  as  reports  of  casual  observation  and opinion that are related to individual’s planned  research  project.  Van  Dale2   defines  “the  review  of  educational research gives you an excellent overview  of  the  work  that  has  been  done  in  the  field  and  helps to keep up with recent developments. It helps  to  move  further  in  the  right  direction”. 
2. ObjectIves 
The  objectives  of  this  study  are  to: 
(a) Search,  identify,  collect  and  evaluate  scholarly  
papers related to information needs and use of  
healthcare  professionals. 
(b) Present  an  overview  on  previous  literature  
about  information  needs  and  use  of  medical  
professionals. 
(c) Identify the global trends on the topic information needs  
and  use  of  health  related  professionals. 
3.   s cOPe AND   met HODs 
The main objective of the paper is to review the  scholarly papers published on the topic information  needs  and  use  of  healthcare  professionals  and  related fields.  For this purpose literature published  over 44 years was collected through the information  resources  like  Directory  of  Open  Access  Journals  (DOAJ),  Directory  of  Open  Access  Repositories  (OpenDoar), MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing  and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL), UGC-Infonet  Digital  Library  Consortium,  Biodiversity  Heritage  Library,  etc.  Different  search  terms  were  used    to  find  out  relevant  articles.  Keywords  such  as  ‘information  needs’  and  ‘information  use’  with  the  terms  ‘healthcare  professionals’,  ‘medical  faculty  members’, ‘general practitioners’, ‘nursing professionals’,  ‘family physicians’, ‘clinicians’, ‘patients’, etc. were  used.  In  addition  to  this,  citations  from  relevant  research papers were also explored to find related  information on more specific topic. Finally eighty six  scholarly  articles  published  within  the  span  of  the  year  1968  and  2012  were  selected  for  this  study.  Two  evaluative  criteria  have  been  used  to  classify  the  articles  that  meet  the  selection: 
(a) Information needs: Purpose or need for seeking  
information  including  patient  care,  continuing

education,  teaching  and  research,  etc. (b) Information  use:  Different  types  of  information  
resources, such as print and electronic publications,  
reference  sources,  databases,  open  access  
sources,  etc.,  and  the  frequency  of  use  and  
barriers  to  seek  information. 
4.   cHA rActerI sAtION Of  grOUP 
The health care providers are doing their service  not  only  for  treatment  and  patients  care  but  also  in  the  field  of  administration,  education,  teaching  and  research.  They  are  all  need  to  be  sufficient  knowledge  in  their  field.  The  present  study  mainly  classified  into  two  facets:  Information  needs  and  information  use.  For  the  purpose  of  reviewing  information needs and use studies on diverse user  groups, the articles were classified into the subtitles  like ‘Medical Faculty Members’, ‘Medical Information  System’, ‘General Practitioners’, ‘Medical Students’,  ‘Patients and General Public’, ‘Nursing Practitioners’,  ‘Family  Physicians’,  ‘Health  Workers’,  ‘Biomedical  Research’,  ‘Specialists’,  etc. 
5. INfOrmAtION  NeeDs 
Information  needs  may  include  information  demand  (or  requirement)  and  information  wants  (or  desires).  With  respect  to  this  study  information  needs are items of information that are required in  delivering lectures, patient care, educating general  public,  etc. 
5.1  medical  faculty  members 
Cohen3,  et  al.  investigated  that  physicians  at  different stages of training rely on different sources  of  information.  This  study  suggests  that  designing  effective medical education requires considering the  level of the physician's training and the nature of the  medical decision. In 2010 Adkoli4, et al.conducted a  survey  among  the  faculty  members  of  the  Medical  Education Unit of the University of Dammam, Saudi  Arabia, to find out the need of faculty development  programme. Respondents suggested initiatives that  should  be  undertaken  by  the  Medical  Education  Unit  and  the  broader  institution. 
5.2   m edical  Information  system 
Medical information system consists of libraries  and online information retrieval systems to satisfy the  information needs of medical community. Northup5,  et  al.found  that  familiarity  with  a  resource  in  the  library is often the basis of the choice of the resource  and  identified  different  types  of  information  needs.  Manning  &  Petit6   investigated  that  there  are  some  information needs which may become collective needs  when  practitioners  begin  to  focus  on  a  particular  area of knowledge in similar clinical circumstances  and setting. King7  undertook an investigation on the  ability  of  the  hospital  library  to  meet  case-related  
466 
information  needs  of  health  professionals  in  eight  hospitals.  Another  study  conducted  by  Schwartz8  reported  that  while  in  medical  school,  physicians  needed  information  that  was  found  in  textbooks  or  conveyed  to  them  during  class  lectures.  As  they  began  their  residencies,  the  type  of  information  they needed changed, and they turned to journals.  Perley9, et  al.  conducted  a  research,  both  clinical  and  non-clinical  respondents  and  emphasised  the  need  for  information  services  customised  to  their  professional information needs, to provide evidence to  support the development of a long-term strategy for  the  Via  Christi  Regional  Medical  Center  Libraries. 5.3   g eneral  Practitioners  (g Ps) 
Hewins10   assessed  that  many  of  the  studies  of  the information needs of medical practitioners are by  their  very  essence  use  studies.  This  is  due  to  the  increasing emphasis in medicine on locating patient  care information with regard to clinical decision-making  and problem-solving. Osheroff11, et al.  mooted  that  the absence of Index Medicus and Medical Subject  Heading (MeSH), terms related ‘clinical information  need’  reflects  the  scant  attention  that  this  subject  has  received.  Forsythe12, et  al. made  an  empirical  study  of  information  needs  in  four  clinical  settings  in internal medicine in a university teaching hospital.  They  addressed  two  main  issues:  how  to  identify  and  interpret  expressions  of  information  needs  in  medicine  and  how  to  broaden  our  conception  of  "information  needs"  to  account  for  the  empirical  data.  In  1999  Bryant13,  in  his  article  discussed  and  identified  the  challenges  intrinsic  to  delivering  information services to primary care. The results of  the  study  conducted  by  Murugan  &  Allysornam14,  shows  that  the  GPs  in  developing  countries  need  more awareness about the use of various information  sources (including digital), for their professional and  personal  competency  development. 
5.4  medical  students 
The study of Cogdill & Moore15  revealed that the  first-year medical students’ information needs most  often  pertain  to  diagnosing  a  problem  or  choosing  a  treatment.  Forrest  &  Robb16 conducted  a  study  to  find  out  more  about  the  information  needs  of  doctors-in-training  and  to  identify  their  preferred  sources  of  information.  The  two  most  important  requirements  were  'more  time  to  find  and  obtain  information' and 'better access to information sources  when  and  where  they  are  needed'.  
5.5 Patients  and general  Public 
Patients and general public are another important  group  who  need  right  information  at  right  time.   Chetwynd17  mentioned in his study almost all doctors  (95  %)  had  some  contact  with  patients  concerning  AIDS. Specific information topics of interest included

personal  safety,  patient  care  and  ethical  issues.  Christensen18, et al. surveyed healthcare professionals  in  a  rural  community  to  identify  the  information  needs of health- care professionals and information  needs  of  patients.  In  a  comparative  study,  Jickling  &  Graydon19   found  no  differences  in  information  needs between men and women. NetWellness, the  Web-based consumer health information service that  focuses on the residents of Ohio evaluated by Guard20,  et  al.  In  2002  Raupach  &  Hiller 
21  
investigated  that  ninety-four percentage patients reported a high level  of  need  for  information  about  one  or  more  issues.  Gender  differences  in  health  information  needs  and decisional preferences after an acute ischemic  coronary event (ICE) examined by Stewart22, et al.  in  2004.  Patients  after  ICE,  especially  women,  reported receiving much less information than they  wanted from all health professionals. Sylla23, et al. collected qualitative data from 75 key informants and  members of two focus groups in Senegal on various  aspects  of  health  information  needs.  Respondents  reported needing information in reproductive health  and  to  address  rumors  and  religious  barriers  to  family  planning.  Majidi24,  et  al.  investigated  that  patients  should  have  some  information  about  it  to  make decision for the remedy and adjust themselves  with  disease  results.  
5.6 Nursing  Practitioners  (NPs) 
Information  needs  of  NPs  is  equally  important  than that of any other health professionals. In 1999  Rasch & Cogdill25  conducted an exploratory study on  the information needs and information seeking in a  sample  of  nurse  practitioners  approved  to  practice  in North Carolina. They reported NPs most frequent  information needs relate to drug therapy, diagnosis,  and other therapy. Fakhoury & Wright26  made a cross- sectional  survey  investigating  communication  and  information  needs  of  community  psychiatric  nurses  attached  to  community  mental  health  teams  in  the  United Kingdom. A pilot study conducted by Xu27, et al.  to find out nurses’ information needs and searching  behaviour  in  acute  care  settings.  The  findings  of  the  study  were  that  nurses'  information  needs  are  different  from  what  is  reported  in  the  literature  in  terms  of  physicians'  information  needs.  
5.7  Health  Workers  
In  this  context  the  health  workers  consists  of  practitioners  in  rural  area  and  in  primary  care.  Lundeen28, et  al.  studied  the  information  needs  of  Hawaii's  rural  health  care  practitioners  and  their  methods  of  accessing  information.  Most  reported  that  journal  articles  were  the  information  sources  that  best  meet  their  needs.  In  1997  Dorsch  &  Pifalo29  investigated that the rural health professionals  were  found  to  request  current  information  on  a  wide  range  of  topics  in  clinical  medicine,  nursing,  
health administration, allied health, social sciences,  and  basic  sciences.  Dorsch’s30     analysis  of  some  studies  indicates  that  rural  health  practitioners  appear  to  have  the  same  basic  needs  for  patient- care  information  as  their  urban  counterparts,  and  that  both  groups  rely  on  colleagues  and  personal  libraries  as  their  main  sources  of  information.  
Giuse31, et al.  initiated  a  study  to  examine  the  information  needs  of  health  care  professionals  in  HIV-related clinical encounters, and to determine the  suitability of existing information sources to address  those  needs.  The  study  suggests  that  present-day  information sources are not entirely satisfactory for  answering clinical questions generated by examining  charts  of  HIV-infected  patients.  Another  study  of  Haigh32  to determine the information needs and support  required by Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) whilst  building  services  based  on  clinical  effectiveness.  It  is  noticed  that  when  seeking  information,  AHPs  are  more  likely  to  use  professional  networks  than  libraries. Lillebo33, et al. studied the needs for status  information and projection of future status and events  for key factors in the perioperative environment. It is  found that information and projection needs differed  significantly between actors. Royle34, et al. conducted  a study to identify what information resources staff  need  to  improve  clinical,  and  managerial  decision  making.  The  findings  revealed  the  need  for  more  information  resources  to  assist  staff.    
5.8   b iomedical research 
In  1968,  Rubinstein  &  Schultz35   studied  the  information  needs  of  biomedical  researchers  by  observing  pattern  of  repeated  use  of  the  BIOSIS  information  from  a  remote  data  terminal  located  at  the  Walter  Reed  Army  Institute  of  Research,  USA.  Another  study  of  Grefsheim  &  Rankin36   on  the  information  needs  of  clinical  specialists  and  biomedical researchers at the US National Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  to  inform  library  services  and  contribute to a broader understanding of information  use in academic and research settings. It was found  that  NIH  scientists  overwhelmingly  used  the  NIH  Library, began their searches at the library's website  rather than Google, were likely to seek information  themselves,  and  valued  desktop  resources  and  services. 
5.9 specialists 
Here  information  needs  of  specialists  refer  to  the  health  care  professionals  in  a  specific  area  of  specialisation  and  health  board  members.  Nail- Chiwetalu & Ratner37  assumed that if evidence-based  practice  (EBP)  is  to  become  a  viable  practice  in  clinical  decision  making,  there  appears  to  be  a  tremendous need for information literacy instruction  in  the  university  curriculum,  as  well  as  through  continuing education activities for currently practicing

speech  language  pathologists.  Thain  &  Wales38 studied  the  information  needs  and  use  of  NHS  library services by members of the West of Scotland  Colorectal Cancer Managed Clinical Network. Most  had  access  to  a  library,  although  not  all  made  use  of it, possibly an indication of the need for improved  communications  between  librarians  and  healthcare  staff.  Zelmer  &  Zelmer39   noted  that  most  hospitals  and  health  agencies  in  developed  countries  have  'advisory  committees'  or  'boards  of  management'.  
6. INfOrmAtION  Use 
Here  information  use  refers  to  how  the  health  care  professionals  use  the  information  in  their  service  to  the  end-users.  
6.1 medical faculty members 
 A study conducted by Curtis 
40,  
et al.found that  use  of  the  print  Index  Medicus  among  faculty  was  in  transition:  While  30.5  %  continued  to  use  the  print resources, 68 % of faculty accessed MEDLINE  through electronic means. DaRosa41, et al. reported  that no differences among the three groups (third- year students, fourth-year students and physicians) in  accurately solving patient care problems. Renwick42 surveyed the faculty in medicine, pharmacy, dentistry,  and  veterinary  sciences  at  the  University  of  the  West Indies. It was found that the faculty had high  awareness of the electronic resources made available  by  MSL,  but  low  use  of  MSL.  The  medical  faculty  members  of  the  University  of  Tennessee  Health  Science  Center  were  surveyed  by  Tenopir43, et  al.  They  report  that  faculty  members  continue  to  rely  on  print  journals  versus  electronic  journals. 6.2 medical  Information system 
Andrews44,  et  al.  studied  the  current  levels  of  information  technology  use  in  a  primary  care  practice-based  research  network  (PBRN).  Only  21  % of practitioners use an electronic medical record  (EMR).  Bird  &  Heekin45   found  that  MEDLINE  was  the  most  frequently  mentioned  database  across  all  disciplines, including the health and social sciences.  Analysis  of  the  responses  and  observations  of  the  Burnham & Perry46  reveal some strategies for enhancing  the  outcomes  of  projects  and  improving  access  to  medical care literature by health care professionals  at  rural  sites.  Williamson47,  et  al. recognised  that  the  ways  in  which  physicians  manage  patients  is  in  part  dependent  on  the  relevance  and  validity  of  the  scientific  information  they  use  in  their  clinical  decision  making.  To  determine  their  use  of  the  internet  as  an  information  source  and  their  access  to  MEDLINE,  Members  of  the  Royal  New  Zealand  College surveyed by Cullen48. 48.6 % reported that  they used the internet to look for clinical information.  MEDLINE was the most frequently accessed source.  Haynes49,  et  al. introduced  self-service  access  to  
468 
the  MEDLINE  into  clinical  settings  to  assess  the  frequency, patterns, purposes, and success of use.  Free  online  access  was  provided  to  MEDLINE  through  GRATEFUL  MED  software.  Maguire  &  Lovelace50  undertook a study to investigate the use  of  Medlars,  an  information  service.  
The  quality  of  MEDLINE  searches  done  by  physicians, physician trainees, and expert searchers  tested by McKibbon51, et al. They found that novice  searchers  on  MEDLINE  via  GRATEFUL  MED  after  brief training have relatively low recall and precision.  Sandra52,  et  al. made  research  to  determine  use  of  online  biomedical  journals  and  databases  and  to  assess  current  user  characteristics  associated  with  the  use  of  online  resources  in  an  academic  health  sciences  center.  While  53  %  of  the  users  indicated  they  searched  MEDLINE  at  least  once  a  week,  other  databases  showed  much  lower  usage.  Maharana53, et  al.  found  that  ICT  can  be  a  useful  tool to address problems in medical education, but  the lack of technology and resources is still a serious  limitation.  Messerle’s54   study  attempted  to  find  out  the  most  acceptable  form  of  that  information  and  the  way  it  is  used  that  thought  could  be  given  to  the ways to bring relevant, timely information closer  to  the  users’  point  of  need.  Srinivasulu  &  Reddy55  found  that  the  library  collection  is  adequate  and  the  DDC  is  the  classification  system.  Most  of  the  respondents  visit  the  library  regularly. 
6.3 general  Practitioners  (gPs) 
A cross-sectional survey among GPs, currently  practicing in France, was conducted by Bernard56, et al.  in  July  2009.  The  practice  conditions  and  lack  of  information were the main barriers. Bowden57, et al.  made  a  survey  of  all  physicians  in  four  counties  in  the  lower  Rio  Grande  Valley  of  Texas  and  to  a  random  sample  of  physicians  in  Bexar  County,  Texas. There was no statistically significant difference  in  either  group's  rating  of  experience  with  using  databases. Multiple linear regression analysis done  by  Curley58,  et  al.  suggested  that  physicians'  use  of clinical knowledge resources could be described  by  the  physician's  level  of  training,  availability,  applicability,  and  the  resource  medium.  Glover  &  Woollacott59 indicated that GPs comprise the largest  group  of  health  professionals  providing  primary  health  care  services.  They  are  frequently  the  first  point  of  contact  with  the  health  care  system,  and  saw  some  85  %  of  the  population  at  least  once  in  1989. Gruppen60  investigated that GPs first access  the  most  preferred  source,  followed  by  secondary  sources  if  the  problem  remains  unsolved.  Haug61  made a study using a meta-analytic procedure and  reviews twelve studies published between 1978 and  1992. The results indicate that physicians prefer to  obtain information from journals and books, but also  that they often consult colleagues. Lockyer62, et al.  

========4========

PRAKASAN: INFORMATION  N EEDS AND  U SE OF  H EALTHCARE  P ROFESSIONALS 
attempted  to  delineate  how  physicians  integrate  medical  innovations  into  clinical  practice.  They  found  that  most  physicians  obtained  information  from  several  sources  before  making  a  change  in  their  clinical  practice.  
Every good physician realises he must perpetually  supplement his knowledge base; he must discard and  add  continually.  This  was  observed  by  Manning  &  DeBakey63. Manning64, et al. reviewed and analysed  individual  physicians’  prescriptions  in  an  effort  to  identify  the  type  of  information  that  would  help  physicians  improve  drug  therapy.  Munro65,  et  al.  noted  that  greater  emphasis  is  being  made  by  the  public  and  the  profession  alike  that  doctors  keep  up to date. Stross & Harlan66  conducted a study to  determine physicians’ knowledge of photocoagulation  in  diabetic  retinopathy.  They  found  that  only  28  %  of  the  family  physicians  and  46  %  of  the  internists  were aware of the study results. Timka & Arborelius67  investigated that from 46 consultations, 262 dilemmas  were  identified  by  the  12  GPs  involved.  Medical  dilemmas were encountered during three out of four  consultations.  Williams  &  Connolly68   surveyed  242  physicians  in  North  Carolina  of  whom  56  %  were  in  family  practice  and  11.5  %  in  general  practice.  Young  &  Ward69   conducted  a  study  to  determine  the  awareness  and  use  of  the  Cochrane  Library  and  access  to  the  internet  by  GPs  in  New  South  Wales. 134 respondents had access to the internet  either at home or at work; 42 were ‘Online’ at their  workplace.  
6.4   m edical students 
Information use pattern of researchers in veterinary  science  and  animal  husbandry  was  examined  by  Biswas & Haque70. This study have primarily depended  on  periodicals  of  veterinary  science  and  allied  branches  for  their  sources  of  information.    6.5 Nursing  Practitioners  (NPs) 
The information resources NPs used most frequently  were consultations with colleagues, drug reference  manuals, and textbooks and protocol manuals. This  was the findings of the survey conducted by Cogdill71.  Spath  &  Buttlar72   revealed  through  this  study  that  nurfconnellyses  seek  information  from  colleagues  more  than  from  any  other  source.  Information  on  databases  may  be  particularly  important  in  light  of  the present study's finding that databases available in  CD-ROM format are consulted very little. Wakeham73  made  a  brief  comparison  with  the  perceptions  that  librarians  have  of  nurses'  information-seeking  activity  followed  by  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  the  ways  that  librarians  consider  that  nurses'  use  of  libraries  could  be  improved.  Wozar  &  Worona74 made  a  survey  on  the  usage  of  online  information  resources by nurses. For this purpose the participants  were  instructed  in  the  content  and  use  of  several  
different  online  resources. A  special  webpage  was  designed for this project serving as an access point  to  the  resources.  Eight  participants  accessed  the  project page thirty-nine times in a thirty-day period.  The  most  accessed  resource  was  Primary  Care  Online  (PCO),  accessed  thirty-three  times.  PCO  was  followed  by  MD  Consult  (17),  Ovid  (8),  NLM  resources  (5),  and  e-journals  (1). 
6.6  Health  Workers 
In 1991, Dorsch75  undertook a follow-up outreach  project  to  extend  and  reinforce  the  work  of  a  National Library of Medicine-funded outreach project  conducted  in  west  central  Illinois.  He  noticed  that  the  introduction  of  Grateful  Med/Loansome  Doc  to  unaffiliated  health  professionals  is  an  important  component in equalising information access. Mullaly- Quijas76, et  al.  describes  the  use  of  focus  groups  as  a  data-gathering  tool,  in  both  theoretical  and  practical  terms.  Musoke77   conducted  a  study  in  1998/99  to  investigate  the  accessibility  and  use  of  information by health workers in rural Uganda. The  concepts that emerged from the analysis of the use  of  information  pointed  directly  to  the  information  needs  of  the  health  workers  studied,  which  shows  that information was valuable in meeting those needs.  Osiobe78  reviewed the use of information resources  by health professionals and their information seeking  behavior  from  a  wide  range  of  existing  literature.  Stinson & Muller79  interviewed 402 randomly selected  health professionals, used to stay abreast of current  advances  in  medicine.  They  found  that  in  addition  to  medical  literature,  the  most  common  source,  the  typical  responder  spent  one  to  five  hours  each  week  in  discussions  with  colleagues.  Timpka80,  et  al.  studied  that  computer  technology  should  be  considered for communication between health care  providers,  as  well  as  for  the  distribution  of  up-to- date  medical  texts. 
6.7 biomedical research 
Murray81, et  al.  reported  that  colleagues  were  an  important  information  source  for  daily  work- related  queries,  yet  journal  articles  in  print  format  provided  the  major  published  information  source.  The preferred methods of locating information were  through  Medline  and  browsing  the  contents  pages  of  journals.  Pyne82,  et  al.  reported  that  clinicians'  use of library resources and the competencies they  require  to  access  information  necessary  for  the  practice  of  evidence-based  healthcare.  It  is  based  on  the  results  of  a  study  commissioned  by  North  Thames  Region  to  identify  the  training  needs  of  clinicians for the adoption and practice of evidence- based  healthcare.  Wessel83,  et  al.  conducted  a  study  which  sought  to  understand  the  literature  search  experiences  and  skills  of  clinical  research  coordinators  at  a  large  academic  medical  center.

The  data  from  this  survey  indicate  that  clinical  research  coordinators  are  a  population  who  would  benefit  from  training  by  academic  medical  center  librarians in how to use electronic library resources  and  services.  
6.8 specialists 
To  determine  how  often  physical  therapists  in  private practice in Vermont use sources of information  for clinical and practice-management decision making,  Hall84  conducted a survey. The therapists' responses  show  frequent  reliance  on  personal  and  office  collections  of  literature  for  clinical  decision  making  but  virtually  no  use  of  bibliographic  databases.  Strother85,  et  al.  randomly  selected  five  hundred  dentists  in  Louisiana  were  surveyed  to  determine  what  information  dentists  seek  and  what  sources  they prefer. Responses indicated that dentists need  information on new techniques in dentistry and that  preferred  sources  are  professional  colleagues  and  personal journal collections. Pelzer85, et al.  carried  out  a  survey  amongst  veterinary  medical  students  in  the  University  of  Iowa.  The  results  shows  that  the  main  reason  for  visiting  the  library  were  to  photocopy  and  to  study  course  materials. 7. ANALYsIs  AND  IN terPretAtION 
When  analysing  the  information  needs  of  the  healthcare  professionals,  different  categories  of  professionals had different types of needs to satisfy.  The medical faculty members often need training and  faculty  development  program  to  serve  the  society.  Some  scholars  like  King  and  Schwartz  suggests  that  there  should  be  an  adequate  collection  in  the  libraries  and  other  medical  information  systems.  General  practitioners  need  more  awareness  and  orientation  programs  in  information  sources  and  services to meet their needs. The important group,  patients  and  general  public  need  information  in  all  stages  of  treatment.  They  need  information  on  the  different  diseases,  treatment  and  also  in  decision  making.  The  nursing  community  often  needs  information  on  drug  therapy,  diagnosis  and  other  therapy.  Yet  their  needs  were  different  from  physician’s  information  needs.  It  was  found  that  health  workers  often  request  current  information  on  a  wide  range  of  topics.  In  biomedical  research  settings scientists always browse the website of US  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  Library. 
Medical  faculty  members  use  information  from  print as well as e-journals, e-information resources  like MSL, MEDLINE, etc. A vast majority of medical  information  systems  prefer  MEDLINE  to  make  use  of  the  user  community.  General  practitioners  often  seeking and using information from books, journals  and  colleagues.  Lack  of  awareness  of  information  sources  is  the  main  barriers  in  using  different  types  of  resources.  The  nursing  practitioners  most  
470 
frequently using or consulting with colleagues, drug  reference manuals, textbooks, protocols, etc. Health  workers  used  to  stay  abreast  of  current  advances  in  medicine.  So  they  frequently  use  information  resources. In biomedical research colleagues were  the  main  source  of  information.  But  MEDLINE  and  print  journals  had  also  significant  role.  The  specialists  like  therapists,  dentists,  etc.,  prefer  to  use  information  on  new  techniques  in  their  field.   
8.   c ONcLUsIONs 
This literature review covers significant studies  on information needs and use of healthcare providers  all  around  the  globe.  It  is  found  that  professionals  in  this  field,  especially  faculty  members,  general  practitioners,  nursing  professionals,  clinicians,  health  workers,  etc.,  need  training  and  faculty  development  programme;  information  regarding  drugs,  drug  therapy,  diagnosis,  clinical  medicine,  nursing,  health  administration,  allied  health,  social  sciences, basic sciences, etc., to serve the society.  So  that  the  information  systems  should  provide  resources like print and e-journals, MEDLINE, Medical  Subject  Headings  (MeSH),  web-based  consumer  health  information  service,  etc.  It  is  noticed  that  the professionals are using the information sources  and  systems  like  colleagues,  print  and  e-journals,  MEDLINE, practice-based research network (PBRN),  Electronic  Medical  Records  (EMR),  Index  Medicus  and  MeSHs.
