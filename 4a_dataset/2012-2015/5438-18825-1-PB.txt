There are several bibliometric studies available  in  the  literature  which  includes  bibliometric  studies  on  single  journals,  citation  studies  and  subject  studies. Studies on single journals presented different  types of bibliometric measures. Common measures  are  article  productivity  of  authors,  author’s  gender,  profession, rank, author’s institutional names & types.  Another bibliometric measure used is co-authorship  pattern and degree of collaboration among authors,  affiliations  and  countries.  Another  measure  is  the  analysis  of  subject  content  based  on  analysis  of  subject  areas  of  articles  published  in  the  journal  using  various  classification  schemes,  thesaurus,  keyword  analysis,  keyword  co-occurrences,  article

title  analysis,  word  frequency  in  title,  types  of  research methodology used, etc. Citation analysis is  also frequently used in single journal studies based  on  analysis  of  number  and  distribution  of  citations  referenced  per  article  over  a  number  of  years;  authorship  pattern  of  citations;  most  referenced  author;  types  of  cited  documents;  the  age  of  cited  documents;  cited  documents  half-life;  and  ranked  list of core journals. A good number of bibliometric  studies  on  single  journals  were  published  in  the  literature which includes studies undertaken by Tiew1 on  102  works  up  to  1997  and  by  Anyi2, et  al.   on  82  works  from  1997  to  2008.  The  scope  of  the  literature reviewed is limited to bibliometric studies  on single journals in the field of science, technology  and  engineering  by  the  Indian  authors. 
A study by Das & Sen3  on  Journal of Biosciences in 2000 showed that 18.68 % articles were single- authored, 52.71 % were double- and triple-authored,  and the remaining 28.61 % were joint contributions  of  four  or  more  authors.  Of  the  citations,  journal  articles comprised 85.89 % and monographs 10.1 %.  Indian contributions comprised 5.53 % of the citations.  Of  the  citing  articles,  30  were  by  Indian  authors,  3  by foreign authors and 1 (2.94 %) jointly by Indian  and foreign authors. Of the total citations, 10.87 %  were  author  self  citations  and  0.57  %  were  journal  self  citations.  
Dutta & Sen4  studied citation analysis of  Indian  Journal  of  Chemistry   Section  A  during  2000  and  found  that  two-authored  citations  were  34.03  %,  three-authored  citations  were  22.01  %,  and  one- authored  citations  were  17.51  %  of  total  citations.  Overall ratio of Indian to foreign citations was 1:36  and 1:47 for journals. The percentage of journal and  author self citation was found to 0.50 % and 15.43 %  respectively. Study by Narang5  on  Indian Journal of  Pure and Applied Mathematics  revealed that highest  number  of  174  articles  were  published  in  2001  out  of 737 articles during 1998-2002. Authorship pattern  showed  that  two  authored  articles  352  (47.76  %)  topped  in  five  years  followed  by  single  authored  articles  259  (35.14  %),  three  authored  articles  113  (15.33) and four authored articles 13 (1.77 %). Out  of 8396 citations, maximum number of citations 2047  appeared  in  2002,  followed  by  2016  in  2001.  With  respect to types of documents cited, 6255 citations  were  journals  and  465  were  books.  Out  of  737  articles,  372  (50.47  %)  were  Indian  contributions  and  365  (49.52  %)  were  foreign  contributions.  Bibliometric studies conducted on the Indian Journal  of Environmental Protection by Biradar6  for the years  1994, 1999, and 2004 revealed that average number  of  references  per  article  during  1994,  1999  and  2004 were 10.6, 11.0 and 13.2 respectively. Among  cited references, 56.6 % were journals, 29.8 % were  books, and 5.1 % were reports. Out of 370 articles,  two  authored  articles  were  144  (38.9  %)  followed  
272 
by  three  authored  articles  96  (25.9  %)  and  single  authored  articles  57  (15.4  %).  Organisation-wise  contribution  showed  that  universities  were  major  contributors  with  31.6  %  followed  by  colleges  with  24  %,  and  research  institutions  with  23.7  %.

for  drawing  inferences.  Due  to  the  involvement  of  multiple  authors  for  producing  articles  from  same  organisation, it is observed that 1205 organisations  involved in 11690 times for publishing 4047 articles.  From Table  3,  it  is  evident  that  ‘Purdue  University‘  contributed  highest  articles,  i.e.,  163  contributing  (4.03 %) to the total 4047 articles, followed by 161  articles by ‘NASA Lewis Research Center’ contributing  (3.98  %)  and  132  articles  by  ‘Pennsylvania  State  University’  contributing  to  (3.26  %)  and  so  on. 5.4  country-wise  distribution  of Articles 
Table  4  shows  that  all  countries  multiple  
contributing more than 50 articles. Larger divisions  participation,  i.e.,  11690  times  in  producing  4047  in various organisations were considered as different  articles.  It  is  considered  to  count  the  same  article  research institute for the purpose of this study and  under contributing countries, if contributors are from
