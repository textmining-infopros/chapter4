AbSTRACT 
This article presents information on various ICT facilities and services provided in engineering institutions  at Rayalaseema Region of Andhra Pradesh. It addresses current status of institutions providing library services  such as traditional, electronic, and document delivery services and facilities like hardware, software and  communication resources. Eighty-one completed responses collected with a total response rate of 88.04 %.  ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test was conducted to fnd out the signifcance of the variables constituting  hardware, software facilities, and communication services versus institutions, respectively. The study showed  that 87.65 % library provided with windows XP and 72.84 % Pentium IV workstation. DELNET seems to  be the most preferred information network service and VSAT is found to be mostly used communication  service. About 60 %  libraries are partially automated and barcode technique is most frequently opted for  circulation. It is concluded from that automation is still an ongoing process in libraries of Rayalaseem Region.

1.  InTRoduCTIon 
The use of information and communication technology  (ICT)1   in  libraries  includes  the  growing  importance  of  delivery  of  digital  contents  and  management  of  electronic  resources,  integration  of  database  system  with  the  web  environment,  and  managing  information  system  of  parent  organisation.  The  success  of  any  library  depends  not  only  on  having  qualified personnel but also on the interaction among  them.  According  to  Lesikar2   communication  is  the  component  that  build  organisation  prospective.  To  achieve  its  objectives,  libraries  must  have  efficient  communication systems. Emuakpor3  describe information  technology  as  all  resource  of  technology  decisive  to  the  processing,  preserving  and  transmitting  information  in  electronic  form  and  the  resources  include  computers,  communication  equipment  and  networks,  fax  machines  and    electronic,  pocket  calculator. Provision of multiple library facilities4  can  have a strong impact on institutional outcomes. There  are studies done throughout India on library services  and facilities. Focusing on  Rayalaseema region of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Kumar5,6   had  made  an  extensive  research  on  digital  collection  and  development  initiatives  in  engineering  college  libraries  where  he  had  provided  opinion  of  librarians  on  various  digital resources acquainted in library. An analytical  survey conducted on digital preservation techniques  
in  engineering  institutions  of  Rayalseema  Region  where the author had examined various preservation  technique  opted  by  librarians  in  their  respective  institutions.  The  author  also  gives  information  on  best-supported  operating  system  for  preserving  digital  materials.  The  article  attempts  to  provide  information  on  various  library  services  such  as  traditional, document delivery service and electronic  service  and  provides  information  on  ICT  resource  availability  in  engineering  colleges.

    aims  to  study  the  position  of  university libraries with regard to resources, services  staff and library automation activities. Similar studies  are conducted by Mohindra, et al8  on user satisfaction  on  quality  of  library  services  at  A.C.Joshi  library,  Panjab University. The authors reported that library  environment  and  library  services  have  impact  on  users’ satisfaction. Various statistical analyses such  as  T-test,  F-test,  and  multiple  regression  analysis  tests  conducted  to  find  out  difference  in  library  attributes and satisfaction and the paper report that  there exists significant difference in levels of library  attributes.  Tanuskodi9   has  made  a  user  survey  on  assessing the efficiency of library services of district  central  libraries  in  Tamilnadu.  He  had  reported  that libraries are lagging behind in providing user-

specific information, and has given certain valuable  suggestion  to  improve  library  services.  Singh,  et  al10   made  a  study  to  provide  present  status  and  constraints  incurred  on  use  of  information  and  communication  technology  application  centres  at  Noida.  The  authors  report  that  most  of  the  library  information  centers  have  basic  hardware  facility,  but  the  amenities  hardly  operated  due  to  lack  of  awareness of LIS professionals on use and operations  of  hardware.  Sarwesh11   provides  comprehensive  information about services and information resources  on  websites  of  libraries  in  Rajasthan.  The  author  states  that  information  provided  in  library  websites  has more variability, the authors point out disinterest  from  management  and  administration,  lack  of  co- operation  from  library  staff  may  be  some  of  the  reasons  for  variability  in  website  information.  
3.  objECTIvES

4.    METHodo Logy  
There are  99 Engineering institutions in Rayalaseema  Region of Andhra Pradesh. Previously, a pilot study   conducted to survey number of engineering college  in  Rayalaseema  Region  of  Andhra  Pradesh  and  
336 
the  study  reported  that  colleges  established  after  2010  lack  infrastructure  facility  in  library,  hence  those  college  were  eliminated  from  the  study  and  questionnaire were distributed to respective librarians  of institutions established up to 2010 only. Stratified  random  sampling  followed  to  collect  primary  data  from  the  engineering  college12   libraries.  Out  of  92  questionnaires distributed, 83 to private engineering  colleges, 6 to Government engineering colleges, and  3 Minority government colleges, 81 completely filled  valid feedback received. Therefore, the data for 81  questionnaires  taken  for  the  study.  A  majority    of  the  respondents  72  (88.89  %)  belongs  to  Private  Engineering institutions, about 3 (3.70 %) responses  belong  to  Minority  Engineering  institutions,  and  6  (7.41  %)  belong  to  Government  institution.    
5.  AnALySIS And  InTERPRETATIon  
Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS)  was used for the analysis of data. Statistical analysis  techniques such as frequency distribution, percentage  analysis,  and  one  ways  - ANOVA  tests  employed. 
5.1  Library  Services 
Generally,  a  modern  library  provides  three  major types of services such as traditional services,  document delivery service, and electronic services.  Librarians  were  asked  regarding  various  services  offered  in  library  and  their  responses  presented  in  Table  1. 
The  nature  and  types  of  services  provided  by  the libraries of engineering college shown in Table 1.   It  is  observed  that  the  all  the  libraries  under  the  survey offer ‘circulation service’ followed by 81.48 %   libraries offer ‘internet service’ and 79.01 % ‘reservation  service.  It  is  observed  that  reservation  service  (79.01  %)  as  third  rank,  ‘reprography’  (76.54  %)  as  4th   rank,  ‘electronic  journals’  as  5 
th 
  rank,  and  ‘reference  service’  as  6th   rank.  This  reveals  that  the  engineering  educational  institution  libraries  are  marching towards the provision of electronic service  and  leading  to  setup  digital  libraries.  Library  and  information science professionals queried regarding  availability of library website services in their college  website  and  their  responses  denoted  in Table  2.  It  could be observed that most of the library websites  (97.53  %)  offer  information  about  library  opening  hours,  while  85.19  %  provides  information  about  OPAC accession and 71.60 % provide links to digital  library  resources,  48.15  %  websites  offer  study  materials  for  library  skills  development  and  45.68  %  afford  documentation  and  support  materials  for  using  library  resources.  
The  respondents  were  asked  to  mention  the  availability/accessibility  of  a  separate  website  or  blog for their library apart from the college website;  their  response  is  given  in  Table  3.

or  more  independent  groups.   ANOVA13 is  used  to  compare variables between different groups. F-test is  used to find the difference in various library facilities  such  as  hardware,  software,  communication,  and  library network services between various institutions  under  study.  Testing  was  conducted  at  (p<0.05)  level  of  significance. 
Hypothesis  1 
the availability of hardware facilities among various —There  is  no  significant  difference  in  engineering  institutions  in Andhra  Pradesh. 
Table 5 reveals the analysis of variance (ANOVA)  of  library  hardware  components  between  various  institutions  under  study.  The  F-calculated  value  obtained for server and workstation are 1.5 and 3.91  respectively,  which  is  less  than  the  F-critical  value  of  4.26,  hence,  the  null  hypothesis  is  accepted.   However, for other hardware facilities the F-calculated  value  of  15.28  greater  than  the  F-critical  value  of  3.35. It is understood that there exists no significant  different among various engineering institutions with  regard  to  server  and  workstation  facilities.  Hence,  significant  difference  seem  to  be  present  on  other  hardware facilities among the institutions. Regarding  software    availability  in  various  institutions,  data  is  presented in Table 6. About 87 % Institutions have  Windows  XP,  40.74  %  institutions  have  Windows

Focusing  onto  software  applications,  74.07%   institution have MS-Office 2003 application, regarding  web browser, 97.53 % institutions are provided with  Internet Explorer and 34.57 % with Google Chrome.  98.77  %  are  provided  with  Outlook  and  14.81  %  with  Eudora,  and  95.06  %  possess  pdf  format. Hypothesis  2—There  is  no  significant  difference  in  the  software  resources  accessibility  in  engineering  institutions  under  study. 
Table  7  reveals  the  results  of  ANOVA  test  conducted to find difference in software components  across  institutions.  For  the  parameters,  operating  system,  the  F-calculated  value  obtained  was  9.51,  which  is  greater  than  the  F-critical  value  of  3.35;  for  portable  document  format  (pdf),  the  attained  F-calculated  value  was  9.31,  which  is  greater  than  the  F-critical  value  of  4.26.  This  implies  that  there  is significant variation between software components  accessed  in  various  engineering  institutions  under  study.  
 There is no difference among software applications,  web  browsers,  and    e-mail  clients    between  the  institutions    since  the  F-values  are  less  than  the

null  hypothesis  is  accepted.  Focusing  on  to  library  internet  connection,  the  calculated  F-value  of  4.96  is found to be greater than the F-critical value 3.40.  It  indicates  that  there  exists  significant  different  among various engineering institutions. Hence, the  null  hypothesis  is  rejected  in  this  regard. 
Table  10  provides  information  about  network  service  availability  in  various  institutions.  DELNET  gains 1st rank with 71.60 % while INFLIbNET obtains  2nd   rank  (13.58  %)  ERNET  stays  in  3 
rd 
  position  (12.35  %). 
Hypothesis  4—There  is  no  significant  difference  in  the  availability  of  information  network  services  in  engineering  institutions.  
Variability in information network services between  institutions  provided  is  shown  in  Table  11.  There  is  no  significant  difference  between  information  network service offered between institutions and the  F-calculated  value  is  2.13,  which  is  less  than  the  F-critical  value  of  3.35.  Hence,  the  null  hypothesis  is  accepted.  In  developing  digital  library  services,  the  first  and  foremost  requirement  is  the  library  automation  services.  Therefore,  the  respondents  asked  to  state  the  extent  of  library  automation,  carried  out  in  their  libraries.  
Table  12  reveals  that  most  of  the  libraries  (59.26 %) are partially automated and 20.99 % are  completely automated while 19.75 % follow manual  procedure.  From  the  analysis,  it  is  inferred  that: (a) Automation  is  an  ongoing  process  among  the  
libraries  under  study.

(b) The  use  of  own  preparation  software  is  also  
observed which reveals that these libraries require  
sufficient  finances  to  prepare  own  software  
stuffs. 
(c) Most  of  the  libraries,  either  fully  automated  
or  partially  automated,  are  paving  the  way  for  
digital  library  initiatives.

The organisation of information/knowledge is an  essential preliminary to its effective exploitation and  dissemination. As the quantity of knowledge expands,  the  need  to  organise  it  becomes  more  pressing.  A  vast  number  of  different  means  of  organising  information devised and exploited since the earliest  times.  With  the  vast  output  of  new  information  and  ever-increasing  degree  of  specialisation  in  all  areas  of  human  knowledge,  heavy  demands  are  being  placed  on  library  information  storage  and  retrieval systems, which can be scarcely met by the

traditional methods except with the use of IT devices.  The  improvements  and  changes  in  computing  and  telecommunications  and  the  integration  of  the  two  fields have had a huge role to play in the methods  of  information  processing  and  dissemination  in  academic  libraries;  thus  improving  the  quality  of  use  to  which  such  libraries  are  put.
