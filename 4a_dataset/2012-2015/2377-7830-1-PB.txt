ABSTRACT
The paper analyses the trends in Indian patents filed in the area of chemical sciences during 1995 to
2008. It highlights the importance of patent literature in scientific developments and global trends in patent
filings. A result of Indian patent filing analysis indicated that filing in India is increasing in the past few years
and many public and private organisations are filing patents in India and in other countries for protecting the
inventions. Among India patent filing activities, chemical and pharmaceutical sciences are the prominent areas.
Individual inventors and assignees from private and public organisations are filing patents, but in India, Council
of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) is leading patent filer.
Keywords: Chemical sciences, pharmaceutical sciences, patent filing trends, Indian patent filing, global patenting
trends

1. INTRODUCTION
Intellectual property rights (IPR) initiatives are
developing fast all over the world. Patent system has
received importance in R&D sector. Patent rights play an
important role in global economy. Patents give legal rights
to patent owners for their inventions for tenure of twenty
years1.
Bowman2 emphasising the importance of patent
literature in R&D states that it constitutes an important
department in an organisation providing technical support
in the achievement of goals and objectives of the parent
organisation. The major function of any research
department is to identify technical opportunities for the
development of innovative ideas and maintaining existing
technology. More importantly, its function is to ensure
that the products of the organisation get into the hands of
the customers. Patent information is a significant source
of information. It is a major source in process evaluation,
product development, and marketing of technical
services. So, although peer-reviewed journal articles are
rated very highly as sources of technical, scientific and
research reading, the patent literature equally occupies
its place of distinction in promoting creative and innovative
research.

Since 2000 there has been an increase in patent filing
at the global level. The Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) report3 indicated
that between 1992 and 2002 the number of patent
applications filed in Europe, Japan, US and elsewhere
increased by more than 40 per cent. The growth in patent
filings is due to increased awareness in protecting
inventions and technology transfers. In 1992, about
6,00,000 patents were filed, and by the end of 2002, the
number grew to 8,50,000. It reached mark of 18,00,000 by
2006. In 1995, patent filed in India were 7036 and it
reached to 24505 at the end of 2006, i.e., rise of 248.28
per cent is observed from the study of annual reports of
Indian Patent Office4 (IPO). Further by the end of 2008, the
growth in patent filing is reported as 35218 (increased by
400.54 per cent). This indicates the growing importance of
patent literature globally.
Patents are being filed in all sectors; however the
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, drugs, and cosmetics
sciences are taking lead in patent filing area. They are
closely followed by electronics and general subject patent
filings. Since 2000, there has been a great demand for the
IPR and patenting inventions are being given top priority.
Patent filing in a country is progress indicator in the area
of knowledge. Databases are made available for
214

searching patent information and relevant data. Statistical
data indicates that every year there is an addition of about
2 lakh patents globally with more than 50 million patents
being made available to researchers all over the world.
World Intellectual Propert Organisation5 (WIPO)
defined patent as “It is an exclusive right granted for an
invention may be product or process which gives new way
of preparing and providing solution to a problem”. It is a
territorial protection and can be sold or licensed. Patent
protection implies that inventions cannot be commercially
made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owners
consent. A patent owner has rights to decide who may or
may not use the protected invention for the period in which
the invention is protected. Patent provides incentive to the
creator for his invention. Filing of patent application to
patent office is mandatory. A patent is granted by a
national patent office or regional patent office on the basis
of application.
Every country has its own patent office and its own
patent law for the protection of innovative ideas. Rights
given by the patents are monopoly rights which prevent
others from making, using or selling the creators invention
for a specified period of time. Patents are issued for
inventions which are solutions to specific problems in the
field of technology. Invention may be related to a product
or a process. In order to get a patent for an invention, the
invention has to be patentable6 (Novel, non obvious,
inventive step, utility, etc.) and application must be filed in
the patent office. Patent document is published as an
application and later granted by the patent office as a
patent. Patents are granted for the inventions related to
process, products, apparatus, and industrial applications.

2. NEED FOR PATENTS
It is clearly realised that in recent days, intensity and
complexity of technology competition has led to
emergence of new ways of extracting information required
for better decision-making in different organisational
levels. Following are the factors that justify the need for
patents in research areas:

•

Patents are excellent source of technical and legal
information

•

More than 80 per cent of information in patents is not
published elsewhere

•

Patents are commercially exploited; substantial
benefits to the inventors or their assignees are gained

•

Patents give enforceable exclusive legal rights to the
inventors for a limited period of time to reap monetary
benefits out of the invention

•

The rights awarded to the inventors are enforceable
against anybody within the jurisdiction of the
Government

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(3)

•

Patents play an important role in development of
technology by helping in planning research and
excluding the chances of repetitions

•

Patents play an important role in transfer of
technology, which in turn results in economic growth

•

Patents are used to identify experts in a particular
area

•

Patents are used to find out which companies are
working in a particular area.

3. IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS IN SCIENCE
Patent literature is more useful to researchers
working in R&D institutes, public undertaking
organisations, private industrial organisations, business
houses, marketing and production units including
planners, patent attorneys, research scholars, inventors
and licensors, etc. The intellectual content of patent
literature helps in developing innovative concepts and also
protects the current invention. It is a good tool for
technology transfer too. Patents are filed in countries
where the inventor wants to protect his invention. A patent
is the only source of information which is scientific,
technical, and legal.
Due to globalisation, during the past few years the
use of patent literature is largely increasing and it is
considered as one of the prime sources for scientific
development and mapping research activity. It is with this
assumption that a detailed study of patent literature in
respect of its importance, need, role in science and
technological development, is gaining momentum. Such
studies will provide better understanding of patent
literature in general. Patent information has a special
place in chemical industries and R&D organisations as it
provides nascent (reported for the first time) details about
an invention. It also provides solution to technical
problems. Due to these special features, patent literature
is used extensively in S&T.

3.1 Growth of Patents in Science
The WIPO7 patent report 2007 gives the statistical
information on worldwide patent activities and reports the
growth and development of the patent literature.
According to this report, at the end of 2005 there were
approximately 5.6 million patents in force worldwide. The
patents granted worldwide have increased at an average
rate of 3.6 per cent and reached to about 6,00,000 patents
in 2005. Among the 5.6 million patents in force in 2005, 49
per cent patents were owned by the applicants from
countries like Japan and USA, then followed by the
European countries. Asian economies were main factors
responsible for highest recorded patent growth in 2007
with China, Japan, and South Korea accounting for more
than a quarter of new registrations.8 China saw a 38.1 per
215

cent rise in the number of new patents over the year 2006.
The US remains the world’s leader, with an estimated
52,280 patents recorded in 2007, followed by Japan with
27,731. On a global basis, the number of new patents
reached a record of 156,100 (increase by 4.7 %) from
2006. India came up with 6354 new patents in 2007
compared to 840 in 1999. The top 20 patent offices,
according to the total number of fillings in 2005, were
Japan, USA, China, Korea, EPO, Germany, Canada,
Russia, Australia, UK, India, France, Brazil, Mexico,
Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Poland, Thailand,
and Israel. The largest number of patents granted
worldwide originates from residents of Japan, USA,
Korea, Germany and France. These accounts for 74 per
cent of patents granted worldwide in 2005.In 2005, from
the 5.6 million patents in force worldwide, 90 per cent are
accounted from the patent offices of USA, Japan,
Germany, Republic of Korea, UK, France, Spain, China,
Canada, Russia. From this information it is found that
Japan, USA, Germany, UK, France, Russia, Korea/China
are the main countries contributing to patents. The
statistical information of patents is very alerting and
hence this area is very popular for carrying out research
studies to find the development in chemical sciences and
compare the various aspects of patent as a prominent
information resource to the researchers.

3.2 Importance of Patents in Chemical
Sciences
Patents are filed in all areas of applied science and
technology, and inventions range from simple
mechanisms to complex chemical compounds. Research
is an inventing process, new developments are constantly
reported, and users need to get the information about new
practices through the literature published by the
researcher. Patent literature plays an important role in
disseminating the nascent ideas to users and hence it is
a unique source of delivering scientific information.
Further, patents identify the unfamiliar technical areas
where one can apply concepts for solution to a problem.
The patent literature assists in indicating growth of
different technical fields and trends among them. Patents
help in tagging the inventors and the investors to develop
new products. Thus, patent has immense value to R&D
users, scientists and researchers. Identification of trends
in research discipline is the main focus. Patents are very
useful to research students, engineers, planners,
economist, R&D managers, innovators, business and
marketing personalities, patent attorneys, etc.
The statistical analysis of patent filings among
selected countries was studied to find quantitative trends
in chemical sciences. The overall analysis of patent filing
has indicated that there is an increase in all the areas of
knowledge and the chemical industries are also in leading
position and the patent filing trend is progressive9.

3.3 Growth of Patents in Chemical Sciences
Chemical Abstracts by American Chemical Society
(ACS) is the main source for evaluation of growth in
chemical sciences. CAS publishes abstracts from
scientific literature published throughout the world in the
area of chemical sciences from 1907. The historical
development of abstracts covered from 1907-2007 is one
of the pointers used for finding the developments in patent
filing. Hence, CAS information resources were consulted
and data of abstracted literature was collected for
analysis purpose.
The statistical data recorded by CAS, regarding
chemical patent publications, abstracted in CS, reported
during the period 1988 to 2007 is given in Table 1.

Source: CAS Statistical Summary 2007

The statistical analysis pointed out that the
abstracted information in chemical sciences is increasing
every year. The growth in patent applications is reported
to be 7 per cent to 10 per cent every year. From 1907 to
2001 CAS included about 7000000 patents and the rate of
increase per year was more than 50,000 patents per year
alone in the area of chemical sciences. Since 2000
onwards growth is continuous and more than 200000
patents are filed per year. However, the growth of patent
literature in chemical sciences is also prominent from
1988 onwards. The growth rose from 9 per cent in 1988 to
70 per cent in 2007 (cumulative growth is 228.77 %).
Similarly the growth in patent filing in other areas and
countries are also reported an increasing trend.

4. TRENDS IN INDIAN PATENT ACTIVITY
In India, efforts are made for the protection of human
intellect through patent filings. For this purpose India has
become a part of the global patent regime. IPO is creating
the awareness among the R&D community regarding the
patents and their global benefits. From 18th July 2007, efiling facility for patent applications initiated for ease in
filing of patents. India joined various treaties like Paris
Convention and Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). India
also plays an important role in WTO and WIPO.
The IPO, from October 2007, is recognised as an
International Searching Authority (ISA) and International
Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) by WIPO under
PCT. National Institute of Intellectual Property
Management has been started in Nagpur on 20 August
2007 for awareness in the area of IP and IPR. PIS, Nagpur
is also providing various patent related activities. Patent
documents are also uploaded on patent office website
http://ipindia.nic.in. International co-operation for
improving the patent administration has increased in India
by initiating cooperative activities with WIPO. Bilateral
Agreements signed with UK Patent Office, France,
European Patent Office, USPTO, Japan Patent Office,
Switzerland, Germany, by initiating technology and
Investment Development Programme. Indian Patent Office
has developed its activities by modernising the activities
and services. It has initiated the Human Resource
Development Programmes and Public Awareness
Programmes.
The IP professionals have been trained by organising
training programs and workshops, etc. and introduced
education and research facilities in IP area. The
developments like TKDL to protect the traditional

knowledge of India is managed well to protect the Wealth
of India in terms of human intellect. Digitisation of records
and building databases as well as procurement of different
databases in the field of IP are initiated to make ease in
developing innovative concepts and help in filing patents10.
In Asian region, India has performed very well since past
few years. The evaluation of patent application filing in
chemical sciences and in other areas in India11 (1995 to
2008) is detailed in Table 2.
The review indicated that among all the areas,
chemical sciences are growing fast and if chemical, drug
and food sciences are associated to chemical sciences,
and about half of the area is covered by chemical
sciences alone. Mechanical engineering is also popular
and the growth of patents is also alarming in this area.
The general class in which all the areas are covered has
rising trend in patent filing. However, it is evident that
since 2002, biotechnology has been separated and
measured individually. This subject area is also very
strong in recent years.
Another development reflected in IPO patent awarding
system is that since 2004 a separate area for computers
and electronics is detailed separately as an individual
entity. Thus it is observed that the patent system in India
is well protected and there is an increase in patent
application filing every year. This is an indication that the
developing countries like India are also leading in
patenting activity due to globalisation and collaboration. In
India growth as compared to 1995-96 (3038) rose by
257.96 per cent in 2007-08 (10875) in these areas.
The patent filing trend in Indian Patent Office was
initially high but eventually it has declined over the years
(1971-85). Since 1986, it is indicating growth and from

2000 onwards, it is increasing steadily. The number
patents granted by Indian Patent Office is increasing
every year. Since 2005, it is increasing steadily as
compared to previous years. This clearly indicated that
growth factor is positive. The trend in patent filing from
2005 to 2007 shows 65.36 per cent growth. However, from
1997 to 2007, the trend in patent filing shows 237.32 per
cent growth.

4.1 Top Patent Assignees in India
The ranking of top patent assignees from 1968 to 2004
in Indian patents filing as illustrated by Stemberg12 from
INPADOC file are Council of Scientific Industrial Research
(3083), Hindustan Lever Ltd (946), Hoechst (766),
Siemens AG (685), Union Carbide Corporation (365),
Procter and Gamble (377), ICI PLC (308) and for the
period 2005-2007 top Indian patent filers are reported as
CSIR (1523), Qualcomm (1431), Bayer (1311), Phillips
Electronics (1272), Hindustan Unilever (1088), Honda
(960), Microsoft (908), Samsung (901), Pfizer (895),
BASF (865), etc.13

4.2 Highlights of Patenting Activity in India
The major developments taken place in IPO are:

•

More than 35,000 patent applications were filed at
IPO during 2007-2008. This indicates 281.82 per cent
rise from 1995 to 2008.

•

Approx 21 per cent annual increase in the patent
applications is observed during 2007.

•

During the last six years there is approximately three
times growth in patent filings at IPO.

•

Under the PCT filing route, around 60 per cent
applications filed with IPO are national phase filings
and around 80 per cent of patent applications are filed
by foreign residents.

•

Most active patent filing areas in IPO are chemicals,
pharmaceuticals and drugs (33 %), computer/
electronics (23 %) and mechanical (19 %).

•

From 2004-2005 to 2005-2006 there is an increase in
number of patent filings in computers/electronics
(105 %), only chemicals (48 %) and mechanical (43 %)

4.3 Trends in Patent Filing
The analysis of statistical data published by CAS14, a
division of ACS, covering articles, patents and books
supports the growing trend in filing patents in the
chemical sciences all over the world. This data analysis
from 1997 to 2007 indicates that periodical literature
218

abstracted in CA has increased by 39.39 per cent,
whereas patent literature has increased by 111.01 per
cent. The data published by Thomson Reuters15 in World
IP Today analyses overall global scenario in patent filing,
and reports that there is a 21 per cent increase in patent
filing since 2002, with Japan, US, China as the leading
countries.
The academic innovations during this period have
increased to 25 per cent in China and Russia. WIPO too
reports the steady growth in patent filing and ranks Japan
as the top patent filing country with 17.5 per cent growth,
followed by Germany, Korea, France, China, UK,
Netherland, Canada, and Australia16. Dunn17 indicated that
patents are treated as an important source of information
and also contributes to the growth of S and T along with
other sources of information. In chemical sciences patent
literature plays a significant role as it discloses current
research ideas for the first time in the form of patent
application to the patent office.

4.4 Global Trends in Patent Filing
The growth in filing patents is prominent among
scientific disciplines like biotechnology, environmental
sciences, chemical, pharmaceutical and drug sciences.
These types of industries are mainly concerned with
consumer products. The growth in chemical,
pharmaceutical sciences is more as compared to other
industries as it has a prominent place in human life. The
industrial growth and patent filing growth is continuous in
this area as new innovative products, preparation,
properties or uses are brought to the notice via patents. In
all branches of sciences, almost all countries are filing
patents but considering the output in the form of patent
filing, few countries like USA, UK, Germany, Japan,
China, France and Korea are leading. It is noticed that
major industries file more than 500-600 patents in a year.
e.g. Bayer Germany, Dupont USA, etc.
It is found that the growth of patents in all subject
areas is prominent and also gaining importance day by
day due to IPR policies. Patents are found in every area of
applied science and technology, and inventions range
from simple mechanisms to complex chemical
compounds. Research is an inventing process, new
developments are constantly reported, and users need to
get the information about new practices through the
literature published by the researcher. Patent literature
plays an important role in disseminating the nascent
ideas to users and hence it is a unique source of
delivering scientific information.

5. CONCLUSIONS
It is noticed that IPO is developing its activities fast
and now compatible with the international patent
searching authority. The trends from various statistical
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(3)

analyses reveal that there is a visible ascendency in the
process of patent filing both at the national and
international levels. This clearly reflects the healthy
growth of scientific innovations and inventions. This has
been observed in the enhanced growth and development
of scientific and technological institutions and also
increased growth of research and development funds all
over the globe.
