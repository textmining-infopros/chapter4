AbstrAct 
India  is  a  very  vast  country  with  over  1.2  billion  population,  having  diversity  at  all  fronts,  mostly  linguistic, cultural, regional, religious, and many more, still if there is any tool or instrument in the hands  of common masses which unifes people, helps them come closer and reduces this diversity is language.  A common language spoken by people from two diverse felds binds them together.  In the present paper  attempt has been made to understand the publication pattern of Hindi, English and Urdu newspaper and  other  periodicals  published  in  India,  along  with  growth  and  distribution  during  during  the  period  1941- 2013. In India as on date 37.50 % periodicals are published in Hindi, 14.51 % in English, and 4.97 %  in  Urdu. Apart  from  these  43  %  periodicals  are  published  in  other  regional  and  vernacular  languages.  To undertake the present study data was retrieved from the offcial website of Registrar of Newspapers  for India (RNI) on January 20, 2014. The study is aimed to evaluate areas like, periodicity, registration  pattern,  languages  covered,  year  and  decade-wise  growth  of  Hindi,  English  and  Urdu  periodicals  and  many other similar areas in correlation with the population both at federal and national level.

1.   I NtrODUctION 
Importance of newspapers and other periodical  publications can never be undermined, for these being  the age old primary sources of information especially  for their print nature which is still going great in this  technological  era  where  people  most  of  the  time  talk and hang around electronic documents. Catering  information requirements of the populace all across  the  globe  on  varied  subjects  and  aspects  is  what  these periodicals are up to. Magazines and journals  do  fall  under  this  category  and  are  also  equally  a  primary source of information, catering different kind  of information requirements of people and together  these different kind of primary sources of information  are counted as periodicals. In fact it the periodicity  of a publication where from the word periodical has  originated,  as  these  publications  are  continuously  published on regular intervals of time. The periodicity  of  different  publications  may  vary  considerably.  Publishing pattern of the most of the periodicals is  print, electronic or even hybrid (where both print and  online  version  of  document  is  made  available). 
It may sound a bit extraneous to talk about the  growth and preference of print version of newspapers  among the readers in information and communication  technology (ICT) era, which has not just revolutioni  sed  ways  and  means  of  information  dissemination  but also the methods and techniques of information 
delivery  and  online  newspapers  are  one  such  technological  marvel.  People  have  already  started  talking  about  the  future  of  newspaper  industry,  as  whether there will be a tangible newspaper copy in  next  couple  of  decades  or  it  will  be  seen  only  in  museums,  especially  the  way  electronic  publishing  has  drawn  whole  world  crazy.  Under  the  prevailing  technological  environment  which  is  committed  to  push  beyond  limits  and  to  touch  new  highs  each  new day, but the fact remains people despite having  free  access  to  online  newspapers  do  hang  to  its  print  version  mostly  owing  the  reason  that  they  drag more pleasure while reading the print versions  of  the  newspaper  rather  the  electronic  copy  of  it.    Newspaper  industry  is  the  only  industry  in  the  world  which  recorded  growth  in  terms  of  copies  circulated and this growth remained consistent even  during  the  recent  global  recession,  irrespective  of  newspaper  being  published  at  local,  national  or  even  at  global  level. 
As per 2011 Census, India is the second largest  populous  country  in  the  world,  having  over  1.2  billion  population1   with  national  literacy  rate  of  74.04  percent  having  22  scheduled  and  over  100  non-scheduled languages with over 1652 vernacular  languages. Hindi apart from being national language  is also the official language of the India spoken by  over  41  %  population  of  the  country  and  UN  has

declared  Hindi  as  the  5th  largest  globally  spoken  language. Apart from Hindi, English is the additional  recognised  official  language  of  the  union  of  India,  but due to its popularity major portion of the official  activities  in  the  country  is  mostly  undertaken  in  English  language.  Urdu  though  not  being  widely  spoken in India but is equally popular to that of Hindi  and English for having rich literary past, especially  Urdu  poetry  which  is  its  backbone  over  which  it  stands tall and high. Bbesides, Urdu is being taught,  written  and  spoken  in  various  parts  of  the  country  makes  it  equally  a  popular  language  to  be  chosen  for present study.  Give these facts the above three  languages have been chosen to assess the overall  distribution of periodicals published across India in  Hindi,  English  and  Urdu  languages.  
RNI is the authorised institution of the Government  of  India,  wherein  it  is  mandatory  for  every  new  periodical  publisher  to  seek  prior  approval  of  the  office about the availability of title and the registration  number  and  adhere  to  other  terms  and  conditions.  The  office  of  the  RNI  in  India  got  established  in  the  year  1956  on  the  recommendations  of  the  press commission of India in 1953 under Press and  Registration  of  Books  (PRB) Act  18672. 
2.   r EVIEW  OF  LItErAtUrE 
Researchers  across  the  globe  have  already  undertaken  a  good  number  of  studies  revolving  round the newspaper industry, highlighting its various  aspects  and  concerns.  The  growing  concern  of  industry  mostly  lasts  around  the  survival  of  print  newspaper  industry,  as  electronic  publishing  has  already  posed  a  great  challenge  to  conventional  means  of  publishing.  At  the  same  time  it  is  being  observed that conventional newspaper publishing is  one among many industries which has shown growth  even  during  the  recent  global  recession,  thereby  refuting the argument whereby e-publishing may be  seen  as  a  potential  threat  to  print  industry.    
Exchange  of  information  from  the  era  of  word  of  mouth  to  invention  of  printing  press  in  1477  by  Johannes  Gutenberg3,  was  a  giant  leap  in  the  history of mankind which not just changed the face  of publishing world but immortalised the publishing  once  for  all.  Coming  into  being  of  printing  press  not  just  gave  the  new  lease  of  life  to  information  publishing  but  to  its  dissemination  as  well.  Mass  production  of  information  changed  the  information  consuming  behavior  of  the  common  masses.  More  and  more  people  were  able  to  have  access  to  information,  which  otherwise  was  not  possible  in  earlier  days  as  it  used  to  take  weeks  or  even  months  together  for  information  to  travel  from  one  place  to  another.  
Johnson & Kaye4  were of the view that blogs are  being  seen  as  more  reliable  source  of  information  than traditional means of news, while as Wilnat5  on  
310 
the other hand in his study observed that consuming  internet  news  does  not  decrease  the  amount  of  time reader spent with traditional sources of news.  Wilnat  is  even  of  the  view  that  internet  news  acts  as  supplement  to  go  for  detailed  traditional  forms  of  news.  Cornog6   is  of  the  view  that  readers  are  failing to be informed can be reason for the failure  of  industry  and  not  the  journalist.    
As  per  the    Canadian  Community  Newspaper  Association  (CNA)  there  are  about  13.7  million adults  who  prefer  to  read  print  newspaper  at  the  weekend,  though  there  is  a  considerable  increase  in  the  internet  news  readers,  as  per  the  yahoo  finance  10  %  readership  has  increased  to  online  newspaper in 20097. Rainie8  in PEW survey observed  that everyday 23 % people go online for news, this  is  for  the  fact  that  internet  has  become  the  fastest  news  delivery  channel  as  it  publishes  news  days  before  it  gets  published  in  conventional  means  of  news  publishing,  said  sabga9.  
To  understand  the  past,  present  and  future  prospects  of  the  newspapers  publishing  industry  of  Canada,  Xed  consultations  under  took  a  study  which  included  advertising  scenario  of  industry,  preference for online and print version of newspaper  by readers. During the survey it was observed that  newspapers remain unprotected and unsubsidi sed  industry in Canada, but still survive for the fact that  it  relies  heavily  on  the  local  news  content.  During  the  survey  5.9  %  respondents  replied  of  reading  print  newspaper  daily  followed  by  38.2  %  once  a  week, and 32.4 % once a month. 70.6 % respondents  however replied that they are ready to give up print  newspaper for its online version. In the same survey  26.6 % respondents replied that they never go online  for  reading  newspapers,  while  as  20.6  %  replied  of  going  online  everyday  for  newspaper  reading.  91.2  %  respondents  replied  they  wonâ€™t  pay  fee  for  online  copy,  however  58.8  %  where  of  the  view  that  govt  should  assist  the  struggling  newspaper  industry  while  as  41.2  %  disagreed  with  it.    
With regard to use of social media for gathering  news,  38.2  %  respondents  replied  they  do  not  use  such  media,  only  17.6  %  replied  that  use  it  on  daily  basis,  while  as  rest  use  once  in  week,  once  in  month  basis.  To  an  interesting  question  35.3  %  respondents  said  they  trust  more  on  print  news,  while  as  meager  5.9  %  trust  online  news,  rest  of  the respondents showed mixed response. Regarding  the  future  of  the  print  newspaper  industry  people  on  whole  donâ€™t  see  it  beyond  five  years7.

To  understand  the  publication  distribution  of  periodicals  under  study  at  federal  level,  to  do  ranking of states as per the periodicals published,  population  distribution  in  terms  of  literacy  and  languages  covered.  
To understand the scope of print industry in the  electronic  era  where  most  of  the  conventional  printing  industry  has  switched  over  to  hybrid  publishing, viz., by making available both electronic  and  print  version  of  same  document.  
4. MEtHODOLOGY 
To  undertake  the  present  study,  data  was  retrieved  from  the  official  website  of  the  Registrar  of  Newspapers  for  India  on  20  January  2014,  available at http://www.rni.nic.in/rni_search_language. asp/.  Keeping  in  view  the  period  of  study  (1941- 2013)  data  was  mined  as  per  the  objectives  of  the  study and was analysed accordingly. In all, 118930  newspapers  and  other  periodicals  stand  registered  with  the  RNI  office  for  the  period  of  investigation.  Data  retrieved  was  purely  raw  and  unstructured,  hence  was  structured  as  per  the  requirements  of  the study.  All the relevant data was put to analysis  by  using  various  statistical  tools  and  techniques.  
5.   sc OPE AND  LIMItAtIONs 
Present study is confined to Hindi, English and  Urdu  periodicals  published  in  India  and  registered  with the Registrar of Newspapers for India.  On the  whole  study  lasts  over  whole  of  19th   century  and  the  first  decade  of  21st   century,  encompassing  the  period  1941-2013. 
Major  limitation  which  came  to  fore  during  the  analysis  of  data  was  about  the  non  availability  of  date  of  registration  of  2478  periodicals,  which  otherwise could have helped to put facts more exact  and straight. Also, one cannot establish the fact as  how  many  periodicals  are  being  actually  published  at  regular  intervals  of  time.  At  few  places  serial  numbers  and  registration  numbers  do  not  showed  consistency,  this  may  be  due  to  de-blocking  of  titles,  which  RNI  does  on  the  non-conformity  of  its  regulations  by  publishers  within  the  two  years  of  inception  of  any  title.  
6. DAtA ANALYsIs 
Data analysis being the important aspect of any  study  as  such  every  care  was  taken  to  put  forth

exact  data  by  taking  double  cross  check.  Apart  from  this,  keeping  in  view  the  objectives  of  the  study  and  as  per  the  nature  of  data  and  thereon  the  type  of  analysis  to  be  made,  data  was  put  to  excel  format  for  performing  simple  operation  like,  addition,  subtraction,  division,  drawing  percentage  etc.  At  most  of  the  places  percentage  has  been  drawn up to two decimal places, however, wherever  it  became  inevitable  to  push  beyond  two  decimal  places  same  was  done  for  better  understanding. 6.1   r egistraion  status  
Registration of periodicals is very important aspect  of their having legitimate presence, upon structuring  of  raw  data  it  was  observed  that,  periodicals  were  having two different set of registration patterns and  this  was  mainly  for  the  fact  that  RNI  had  adopted  to  new  registration  pattern  for  periodicals,  as  such  a good number of periodical publishers had applied  for  it,  while  as,  still  a  major  lot  was  found  going  on  with  the  old  registration  pattern. Accordingly  in  the  above  tabulation  attempt  was  made  to  analyse  data as per their registration status. In all 55.11 %  periodicals  are  registered  under  old  registration  pattern and 44.89 % follow new registration numbers.  During  the  period  of  investigation,  in  all  37.5  %  periodicals were published in Hindi language out of  which 52.35 % are registered under old registration  pattern and 47.65 % under new registration pattern.  Accordingly 14.51 % of total periodicals were published  in English language with 61.32 % registered under old  registration  number  and  38.68  %  under  new  registration pattern. Urdu has a total share of 4.97  %  out  of  which  53.47  %  are  registered  under  old  registration pattern and 28 % under new registration  pattern.  Other  periodicals  have  a  share  of  43  %  of  which  53.48  %  are  still  registered  under  old  pattern and 46.52 % under new registration numbers  (Table  1). 
6.2  Periodical  Distribution 
Periodicity  is  one  of  the  important  aspects  of  periodical  publications.  The  above  tabulation  is  the  assessment  and  reflection  of  the  13  different  periodicities adopted by various publishers to publish  their  periodicals.  Periodicities  like  daily,  weekly,  fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly  are  very  common  and  people  as  such  are  familiar  with these kind of periodical publications, but there

are  some  other  periodicities  with  which  people  are  less familiar, these include, alternate day, bi-weekly,  tri-weekly, four-weekly, four-monthly, once in two years,  once in three years, etc. At the gross national level  a maximum of 32.37 % periodicals during the period  of  study  were  registered  as  Monthly  publications,  followed  by  31.23  %  as  Weekly  and  12.25  %  as  Daily publications. Two periodicals are registered with  periodicity of Alternate Day and one as four-Weekly  having  minimum  periodicity  share  at  national  level  but these have been clubbed with other periodicities.  Amongst the registered Hindi periodicals a maximum  of  42.63  %  periodicals  are  published  as  weekly,  followed  by  24.44  %  monthly  and  13.82  %  daily.  Accordingly, among the registered English periodical,  a  maximum  40.38  %  periodicals  are  published  monthly,  15.23  %  &  13.56  %  quarterly  and  weekly  respectively.  Urdu  being  the  fifth  largest  language  has  a  maximum  of  38.62  %  weekly,  25.35  %  daily  and  22.68  %  monthly  periodicity  (Table  2). 
6.3 ranking  of states 
Since India is a federal democracy and to have  in  depth  assessment  of  periodicals  published  from  different states of country given their population size  and  literacy  rate  count  will  serve  many  purposes.   Table  3  shows  ranking  of  states  on  the  basis  of  maximum number of periodicals published from any  given state of the country. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra  and Delhi are the three leading periodical publishing  state  of  the  country  having  share  of  15.66  %,  13.29  %  and  12.33  %  respectively.  Lakshadweep  has  only  7  registered  periodicals.  from  the  total  registered  44605  Hindi  periodicals,  Uttar  Pradesh  leads the tally with a share of 32.74 % periodicals,  followed  by  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Delhi  with  the  share  of  18.96  %  and  13.06  %  respectively.  Out  of 17262 registered English periodicals, Delhi leads  with  29.38  %,  followed  by  Maharashtra  and  Tamil  Nadu  with  19.38  %  and  8.02  %  respectively. from

rest of the states have title share below the national  average.  This  in  fact  also  breaks  the  myth  that  literacy  rate  has  got  nothing  to  do  with  the  titles  published, as Kerala and various other state do not  fall under this category despite having literacy rate  far  above  the  national  average  (fig.  1). 
6.4  Five-yearly  Growth  of  Newspapers 
(1941-2013)

Urdu  periodicals  27.52  %  per  year  and  rest  of  the  periodicals grew at 17.38 % per year. Although the  distribution  reflected  above  has  a  class  interval  of  five  years,  while  as  when  it  can  be  seen  that  the  different  kind  of  periodicals  recorded  maximum  growth  during  the  last  three  years,  viz.,  for  the  period  2011-13.

recorded maximum 1000 %  growth during the period  1946-50,  while  as  rest  of  the  periodicals  recorded  maximum  corresponding  percentage  growth  during  the  period  1956-60  (fig.  2). 
During the analysis one interesting aspect which  came  to  fore  was  about  decline  in  the  introduction  of  new  periodical  publications  and  the  maximum  corresponding  decline  percentage  was  recorded  except  for  Urdu  publications  during  the  period  1981-90. At gross national level maximum negative  growth during the period remained -44.27 % Hindi -27.42  %  English  -45.83  %,  while  as  rest  of  the  periodicals recorded -54.35 % decline during the period  for  reasons  not  known.  Urdu  language  periodicals  do  recorded  decline  during  the  said  period,  but  maximum  -40.96  %  corresponding  decline  was  recorded  during  the  period  1996-2000.  The  period  of  analysis  lasts  over  last  seven  decades,  viz,  for  the  period  1941-2013. 
Since the RNI got established in the year 1956,  at  the  gross  national  level  there  were  646  titles  published across the country, before the established  of  RNI  and  the  number  rose  to  118930  periodicals  by  December  2013.  Data  of  registration  of  2478  periodicals  could  not  be  established  from  the  RNI  data,  as  such  have  been  put  under  the  separate  category  at  the  bottom  of  the  table,  having  gross  national  share  of  2.08  %.    
7. DIscUssION AND cONcLUsIONs 
Cultural  diversity  plays  a  very  vital  role  in  the  publication  of  newspapers  and  other  periodicals  in  a  country.  India  being  the  worldâ€™s  second  largest  populous  country  has  diversity  at  every  front  and  is  also  the  worldâ€™s  largest  newspaper  publishing  country (in terms of circulation). By having registered  periodicals  in  more  than  132  languages  speaks  volumes of the Indian diversity. As per the registration  dates  available,  during  the  year  1941  only  6  titles  were introduced and this number rose to introduction  
of  as  many  as  8146  titles  alone  in  the  year  2013.  This  unprecedented  growth  of  newspapers  and  other  periodicals  can  be  owed  to  the  growing  consciousness  among  public  towards  seeking  the  first hand information about the developments taking  place in and around them. Hindi and English besides  being official languages of the country are also the  two leading languages having maximum number of  registered  periodicals  during  the  period  of  study.  Urdu is the fifth largest language. Languages under  study  find  it  easier  to  have  both  online  and  print  version of their periodicals but the case is not same  for  publishers  of  periodicals  of  other  vernacular  languages, as such they tend to stick and rely more  on  the  conventional  means  of  publishing.      
Difference  in  registration  patterns  is  what  RNI  is  required  to  take  care  of,  the  RNI  office  should  take  every  measure  to  ensure  uniform  registration  pattern by issuing unique identity to each individual  periodical.  The  varying  periodicity,  daily  to  yearly  publications is still understood, but the publications  like  once  in  two  years  and  once  in  three  years  sounds a bit unusual, as what sort of purpose these  publications may be serving, unless the same have  specifically  come  up  to  cover  some  special  event  taking places after every two or three years.  Apart  from these, RNI also needs to streamline periodical  data by adding other vital information like, mode of  publication,  print  or  electronic,  nature  of  periodical  like, whether it is a newspaper, a news magazine, a  journal, a serial, a standard, an in-house publication  or  any  other  publication.  
Although India being the worldâ€™s largest periodical  publishing  country,  but  when  it  comes  to  catering  information  requirements  of  the  literate  population  of the country and the share percentage of number  of  titles  to  per  thousand  literate  persons,  then  the  figures  stand  far  below  the  other  western  and  European  countries.  As  per  the  figures  available  on  RNI  website  more  than  37,38,39,764  copies  of

newspapers are daily circulated throughout country  to  cater  information  requirements  of  778  million  literate persons, which on average makes 0.48 copies  available  to  each  literate  person  of  the  country.   Internet  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  information  dissemination means and is being seen as potential  threat to conventional means of newspaper and other  periodical publishing, but the publishers do have at  the  same  time  adapted  technological  advances  for  wider and better reach to their audience. As of now  online  version  of  periodical  publication  is  helping  in  the  promotion  of  its  print  version,  so  internet  is  proving  as  a  blessing  in  disguise  to  periodical  publishing  industry.  
Print industry is bound to survive the ordeal of  electronics  for  the  fact  that  in  India  mere  11.4  %  percent people have access to internet and at global  level  these  figures  stand  around  34  %.  So  given  this  fact,  print  is  not  just  going  to  survive  but  is  equally bound to grow to serve the 66 % populace  of  the  globe  who  still  rely  heavily  on  the  printed  version  of  primary  source  of  information10.
