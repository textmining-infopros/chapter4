AbStRAct 
  In  recent  years,  the  internet  has  emerged  as  the  most  important  and  powerful  medium  for  the  communication of information. There is a tremendous growth in the number and variety of information  resources available on the internet which becomes an important source for scholarly scientifc literature  and also more number of information resources as well as the results of scientifc and medical research is  now being available on web. The paper describes the use of web resources (e-journals and e-databases  subscribed by UGC-Info-net consortium) by the students of medical sciences at Aligarh Muslim University,  India. A well structured questionnaire was administered to 120 students to collect the primary data from  respondents. A total number of 92 flled in questionnaires were received showing overall response rate  of 76.66 %. The paper also indicates that it is probably counter-productive to evaluate students as one  group.  Different  segments  of  students  have  very  different  and  varied  use  patterns  of  web  resources  depending on study topic, study year, psychological dispositions, and other demographic factors.   
Keywords: Web-resources, medical literature, e-journals, e-resources, user study  
1.  IntRodUctIon  
The  concept  of  web  resources  is  being  used  interchangeably synonymous with online resources,  digital  resources,  and  e-resources.  But  in  simple  connotations web resource can be regarded as the  resource, document or information available on the  internet  or  world  wide  web.  The  concept  of  web  resource is primitive in the web architecture, and is  used  in  the  definition  of  its  fundamental  elements.  The term web resource was first introduced to refer  to  targets  of  uniform  resource  locators  (URLs)  but  its  definition  has  been  further  extended  to  include  the  referent  of  any  URL.  
According  to  Bokor1,  “Although  the  world  wide  web is the major space for posting and disseminating  information on the internet there is lack of centralised  control or authority statistics about the web in terms  of web pages, websites, and users, even though the  world  wide  web  has  grown  by  exponential  rate  at  50  %  a  year,  which  represents  an  even-increasing  proportion of human knowledge is becoming available  online.” 
1.1  Web-based  Information  Resources 
These  resources  are  also  known  as  internet  information  resources.  These  resources  may  be  
Received 4 July 2013, Online published 18 March 2014 
categorised as websites, portals, online courses, list  servs,  special  internet  groups,  virtual  conference,  chat,  e-journals,  e-books,  mailing  list,  multimedia  collection,  web  links,  map  collection,  online  book  shop,  sound,  etc.  The  most  popular  information  resources  used  by  students  are  search  engines  and  subject-related  databases.  
1.1.1  E-journals 
  In  an  academic  environment  scholarly     communication is a critical component of knowledge  with  the  emergence  of  internet,  the  e-journals  are  going more important on internet and the e-journal  are  undergoing  a  drastic  change  and  becoming  web  centre.  E-journals  are  serially  published  and  distributed nationally and internationally via networks.  These  include  both  online  and  also  journals  which  has  a  print  counterpart.  
1.1.2  E-books 
  E-books  are  electronically  produced  text  (digitised) in various formats (html, xml, doc, pdf, etc.)  original  or  transferred  to  e-format  under  conditions  of  conformity  with  copyright  law  stored  in  a  digital  medium  (CD-ROM,  hard  disk,  etc.)  and  is  played  using  an  electronic  hardware  device.

3.  RevIeW   of  Rel Ated lIteRAtURe 
Web  resources  are  significant  part  of  study  materials.  The  web  resources  are  easy  to  utilise,  speedy,  reliable,  and  useful  and  effective.  The  study  offers  a  way  to  identify  the  acceptance  of  web  resources  by  the  medical  sciences  students  along  with  its  advantages,  performances,  user’s  satisfaction  and  obstacles  during  the  use. 
Study  of  related  literature  implies  locating;  reacting  and  evaluating  reports  of  research  as  well  as  report  of  casual  observation  and  opinion  that are related to the individuals planned research  problems. 
Sedghi2, et al . investigated the resources used  by  health-care  professionals  while  searching  for  medical  images  of  29  health-care  professionals  from  various  health  and  biomedical  departments  working  within  Sheffield  Teaching  hospitals  NhS  Foundation  Trust.  They  confine  that  health-care  professionals  seek  medical  images  in  a  variety  of  visual  information  sources,  including  those  found  online  and  from  published  medical  literature.  The  research also identified a number of difficulties that  health-care  professionals  face  when  searching  for  medical  images  in  various  image  resources. 
Chowdappa3, et al. depicts the extent of dependency  of  users  of  Educational  and  Research  Institute  of  Mysore city on the electronic/digital media and tried  to find out the impact of e-information resources on  the  academic  community. The  main  objectives  wss  
126 
to  know  how  information  users  rely  upon  books,  journals,  CDs  and  internet  for  their  research  and  the  opinion  in  the  use  of  digital  sources  compared  to  the  traditional  sources. 
Kanniyappan4, et al. found out the use of different  types of e-resources and services and their impact  on the academic development of faculty members at  Anna  University  library,  Chennai.  Findings  indicate  that  the  overall  respondents  use  computers  and  online services. Majority of them use e-mail, internet,  OPAC  system  and  online  journals. A  good  number  of  respondents  feel  that  printed  journals  will  not  become  obsolete  in  future.  Most  of  the  faculty  members  are  aware  of  e-resources  and  they  are  being  used  frequently  for  the  teaching  purpose.  
Asemi  &  Reyahiniya5   conducted  a  survey  on  awareness  and  use  of  digital  resources  in  the  libraries  of  Isfahan  University  of  Medical  Science,  Iran.  Results  indicate  that  majority  of  students  are  aware  of  digital  resources  available  in  university  database  and  most  of  them  do  well  to  using  the  resources. The increasing amount of awareness of  IT facilities will lead to an increased to the amount  of  resources.  
Lal6, et  al .  studied  uses  of  internet  access  by  medical  students  and  resident  doctors  of  Maulana  Azad  Medical  College  (MAMC)  and  found  that  it  has  a  lower  cost  as  compared  to  paper-based  dissemination of information and also has an added  advantage  of  being  available  world  wide  instantly  on  demand.  Therefore,  there  is  a  need  not  only  to  equip  medical  fraternity  with  adequate  skills  for  use  of  internet  but  also  to  make  internet  facility  available in institutions providing medical education  and  health-care.  
4.    o bjectIveS 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
•  Know  the  awareness,  use  and  purpose  of  use  
of  web  resources 
•  Find out the frequency and place of using web  
resources 
•  Identify  the  reliability  of  the  web  resources •  Identify the various techniques adopted to locate  
the  web  resources 
•  Know  the  barriers  while  using  web  resources •  Identify which publishers’ e- journals/e references  
are  consulted  by  students 
5.  Methodology 
This  study  used  questionnaire-based  survey  method.  A  well  structured  questionnaire  was  administered  to  120  students  of  JNMC  randomly  selected samples to collect the primary data. Out of  which, a total number of 92 filled in questionnaires  were  received  and  the  overall  response  rate  was

6.2   f requency  of  Web  Usage 
The  respondents  were  asked  to  indicate  the  frequency for which they make use of web resources.  
The purposes have been classified into four categories  
The empirical evidence in the paper is data drawn  
as  shown  in  Table  2.  It  states  that  48.14  %  MBBS  from  an  extensive  survey  of  students’  uses  patters  
of  web  resources  in  JNMC.  Questions  like  name,  
students  use  web  resources  occasionally.  41.17  %  gender and educational qualification were asked. It  
MD/MS  students  use  it  daily,  followed  by  35.28  %  is evident from the data that students use the web  
weekly.  It  was  noted  that  100  %  PG  Diploma  resources, out of 92 received responses, 63 % were  
students  use  daily.  So  it  can  be  concluded  that  male and 37 % were female. Out of 92 respondents  
highest  percentage  of  students  32.60  %  are  using  
web  resources  occasionally.  
54 students were pursuing MBBS; 34 were pursuing  MD/MS  while  4  were  pursuing  PG  diploma. 
6.1  purpose  of  Using  Web  Resources 
The  respondents  were  asked  to  indicate  the  purpose for which they make use of web resources.  The purposes have been classified into five categories  as shown in Table 1. It was found that a total of 20  (37.03  %)  MBBS  students  use  web  resources  for  improving their knowledge, followed by 14 (25.92 %)  for finding quick information. 41.17 % MD/MS students  use  web  resources  for  improving  knowledge  and  only  17.64  %  use  it  for  finding  quick  information.  It  was  noted  that  50  %  PG  Diploma  students  use  web  resources  for  improving  their  knowledge  and

The  use  of  web  resources  by  the  students  of  Jawaharlal  Nehru  Medical  College, Aligarh  Muslim  University,  Aligarh,  shows  100  %  of  the  students  were  aware  of  web  resources  and  mostly  make  use  of  them.  The  objectives  of  the  following  study  are satisfactorily met and most of the students are  satisfied  with  the  web  services  available  to  them.  They  use  new  means  of  technology  for  retrieving  quick  information.  The  web  resources  available  on  internet  are  used  by  user  generally  in  cyber  cafe  and  in  other  place,  i.e.,  personal  connection.  Web  contains  a  wide  range  of  information  and  provides  links to other resources. For searching web resources  generally links through search engines is preferred  over others. Web resources have become the important  part of human life in the 21st century for their study  and  knowledge.  Popular  publishers  of  e-journals  (consulted by them) are Medline  and  Science direct .  So  it  can  be  said  that  the  planning,  developing,  and  extending  the  computer  and  internet  facilities  make them aware to information resources in new era.
