ABSTRACT 
Academic  institutes  build  the  institutional  repository  (IR)  where  all  the  scholarly  contents  and  intellectual output of the host institute are captured, stored, indexed, preserved, and redistributed. Flow  of content is the preliminary requirement for development and sustainance and the faculty members  are  the  main  source  of  the  fow  of  content.  But  low  rate  of  participation  of  faculty  members  in  IR  phenomenon is a major issue for the success of IR. Lack of awareness and confusion about copyright  issues are the known barriers in faculty participation in it. This paper reports the results of a survey  among selected science and technology faculty members of University of Calcutta covering different  aspects of IR. The aspects are mainly the awareness about IR and the willingness to participate in  it. This paper also highlighted the perceptions of faculty members regarding current copyright issues  especially  the  issue  of  dual  copyright.  The  paper  concludes  that  the  faculty  members’  attitudes  regarding  IR  is  more  or  less  positive. The  IR  helps  to  increase  professional  visibility. According  to  the opinion of the faculty members, the copyright issues should be handled by the authority of the  
institution concerned. 
Keywords: IR-awareness, dual copyright, institutional repositories 
1. InTRodUCTIon 
The  means  of  disseminating  scholarly  content  has been greatly expanded through the internet and  its  capabilities  for  immediate  and  broad  access  to  information. The movement towards open access (OA)  journals and repositories are prime examples of the  way the academies are trying to take advantage of  this technology by wider dissemination of research,  making  it  free  of  charge,  and  attempting  to  reduce  copyright  restrictions.  Institutional  repository  (IR)  is  able  to  address  the  challenges  faced  by  faculty  members in attempting to disseminate their research  through  the  internet,  and  to  utilise  various  forms  of  digital  media  for  scholarly  communication.  To  design and develop IR, the preliminary requirement  is  deposition  of  the  contents.  The  main  source  of  content for any academic IR is the faculty members.  To initiate and to sustain an IR, the flow of content  submission  is  very  much  important.  However,  it  may  not  be  generalised  that  the  potential  value  of  IR  is  not  yet  fully  appreciated  by  faculty  members.  Although very few institutions have their own IR and  only a small proportion of faculty members deposit  their scholarly content into it. This low rate of faculty  participation  is  a  common  phenomenon  across  the  world,  and  it  is  a  major  issue  for  the  success  of  those repositories. It can be assumed that the lack  
of awareness about IR and its potential, and many  other  related  issues  are  the  main  reasons  for  this  low participation in it. Kim1  shows that only 40.1 %  faculty members of Ewha Womens University, Korea  were  aware  of  their  university’s  IR.  He  also  raised  two basic research questions to identify the behavioral  factors  that  motivate  or  hold  up  the  willingness  of  faculties  to  contribute  scholarly  content  in  IR:  (a) Which  are  the  factors  that  encourage  faculty  participations  or  willingness  to  participate?  and  (b)  Which are the factors hold back faculty contributions  or  unwillingness  to  participate?  He  identified  that  academic reward, professional recognition, accessibility  and publicity are the factors which encourage faculty  participations. Additional time, effort, and copyright  issues  are  the  factors  which  hold  back  the  faculty  contributions. Same way Abrizah2  has shown that only 35.9  %  respondents  of  his  survey  were  aware  that  of  Malaya  University  initiative  to  prepare  an  IR. 
The  flow  of  content  of  any  IR,  including  the  sustainability, is depending on the content providers’  awareness  and  their  willingness  to  participate.  Allen3   has  traced  how  crucial  the  development  of  understanding  and  the  attitudes  of  academicians  in  different  disciplines  in  this  regard.  He  has  also  found  that  compared  to  science,  technology  and  medical disciplines, the awareness among humanities  academics  is  low.  By  reviewing  different  papers

Grundmann4   established  that  institutional  mandate  regarding  depositing  of  content  in  IR  is  the  best  way  for  flow  of  content. 
Pelizzari’s5   survey  results  show  that  44  %  of  the  respondents  of  Economics  and  Law  subjects  of  the  University  of  Brescia,  Italy  know  about  the  existence of IR. But of those aware of the existence  of  IR,  only  4  %  affirmed  they  had  already  used  them  to  deposit  papers. 
There are also lots of works, reveal the unwillingness  to participate, like Hey6, Thomas & McDonald7, and  Burn & Wilson8. According  to  their  several  surveys  there are many reasons behind the unwillingness to  participate in IR. One of the most important issues  in  this  regard  is  the  copyright.  
Traditionally,  authors  are  required  to  transfer  their  copyright  to  journal  publishers  in  return  for  publication  of  their  works.  This  is  usually  the  case  with  commercial  journal  publishers.  Commercial  publishing agreement contained among its terms the  assignment  of  copyright  to  the  publisher.  Authors  were  given  minimal  usage  right  to  their  works.  The  publishing  agreement  expressly  states  that  the  duration  of  the  assignment  would  be  for  the  full  term  of  the  copyright  (usually  70  years)  plus  any  extensions  or  renewals. The  problem  with  this  conventional  publishing  agreement  is  requiring  the  assignment  of  copyright.  An  alternative  publishing  agreement9  or dual copyright allows the author of a  work to grant to the publisher the rights necessary  to  enable  the  publisher  to  publish  the  work  while  at  the  same  time  allowing  the  author  to  retain  the  copyright to the work. Alternatively, an author could  opt to publish his work in an OA journal that permits  the author to archive his published work in an open  access repository like IR. In this way, the work will  be  given  the  widest  possible  dissemination. 
A survey was done recently among the Science  and Technology faculty members of the University of  Calcutta to understand the attitude and perceptions  of them towards any IR and also the awareness of  current  copyright  issues.  If  it  is  proposed  for  the  said  university,  what  factors  are  to  be  considered  regarding faculty members awareness about it and  whether  they  will  deposit  their  scholarly  contents  to  it? 
2.   oB jeCTI veS 
The  main  objectives  of  this  study  are  to  know  about: 
• The  awareness  of  faculty  members  about  IR • Their  willingness  to  participate  in  IR 
• Their  perception  about  incentives  of  IR • Their awareness about dual copyright or alternative  
publishing  agreement.

3. MeThodology 
A  descriptive  survey  method  that  consists  of  the  structured  questionnaire  has  been  adopted  in  this  study  for  collection  of  data.  Selected  faculty  members of different departments of the University  of  Calcutta,  scattered  in  different  campuses,  have  been  interviewed. 
All 27 Science and Technology departments under  two  Faculty  Councils  of  Post  Graduate  Studies  of  the University of Calcutta have been considered for  this  survey. The  Faculty  Council  for  Post-Graduate  studies in Engineering & Technology has 7 departments  and  the  Faculty  Council  for  Post-Graduate  studies  in  Science  has  20  departments10. 
There  were  314  faculty  members  in  all  27  departments  as  on  June  2013.  15  %  (47)  of  them  were  selected  consisting  both  the  professors  and  others  (like  Associate  Professors  and  Assistant  Professors)  for  this  survey.

AnAlySIS   &  F IndIngS 
4.1 Preferred  Channel  of  Publishing  (other  
than  print) 
Most of the recognised academic disciplines have  their own journals and other outlets for publication,  although  many  academic  journals  are  somewhat  interdisciplinary,  and  publish  work  under  several  distinct  fields  or  subfields.  There  is  the  evolution  from  the  print  to  the  electronic  format  and  now,  academic  publishing  is  undergoing  major  changes.  In this segment, the respondents were asked about  their preferred channel of publication of their scholarly  contents  in  other  than  print  mode  (Table  1).  
Table 1. Preferred channel of publication 
Preferred channel  Respondents (%) 
Professors others Total  Personal website/Blogs 1 (4.16) 2 (8.70) 3 (6.4) Departmental website 10 (41.67) 4 (17.39) 14 (929.8) Open access journals 13 (54.17) 17 (73.91) 30 (63.8) Total 24 (100) 23 (100) 47 (100) 
It  was  observed  that:  
(a) Most  of  the  respondents  don’t  have  personal  
website,  so  there  are  little  scopes  to  prefer  it  
in  this  regards.  Only  3  faculty  members  had  
their  personal  website. 
(b) 10  (41.67  %)  professors  expressed  their  
preference to publish their research materials in  
the departmental websites, although most of the  
departments  have  no  departmental  websites. (c) Most of the respondent other than the professors  
(73.91 %, i.e., 17), have mentioned OA journals  
as  their  preference  to  publish  their  research  
materials  compared  to  the  professors  in  this

regard (54.17 %, i.e., 13). One reason may be  
that  the  other  than  professors  are  much  more  
comfortable in handling the electronic mode and  
networking  system  as  their  average  age  (44  
years)  is  lower  than  the  professors’  average  
age  (56  years)  (Table  2).

4.2 Respondents’ Awareness  about  IR 
Faculty  members’  view  regarding  IR  is  one  of  the  important  factors  for  establishing  it  in  that  organisation.  In  this  prospect  the  awareness  of  faculty  members  regarding  IR  is  also  important.  It  is  revealed  from  Table  2  that  the  scenario  about  their  awareness  is  not  satisfactory.  Just  more  than  50  %  of  them  are  aware  about  it.  
It  is  further  revealed  that  most  of  the  aware  respondents  came  to  aware  about  it  through  the  internet.  Table  3  shows  the  detail  about  how  the  faculty  members  became  aware  about  IR. 
It  is  revealed  from  Table  3  that  most  of  the  respondents, who are aware are not dependent on  librarian  or  library  staffs  in  this  regard.  19  (80  %)  faculty members came to know about it through the  internet. The percentage of other than professors is  much higher than the percentages of professors in the  same respect. So the library professionals should take  a  proactive  role  in  awareness  development  on  it.

4.3  Willingness  to  Participate  in  IR  System 
In  most  of  the  cases  the  respondents  were  found  to  be  confused  to  contribute  their  content  to  the  IR  of  different  institutes.  There  are  several  reasons for unwillingness to participate in it. One of  them is the copyright issue. In this study two types  of  content  were  considered,  one  is  post-published  or previously-published articles, and another is pre  -published  or  work-in-progress  articles  and  have  asked  the  respondents,  which  one  they  preferred  most to contribute to IR. The results are displaying  in  Table  4  and  Table  5. 
51.06 % faculty members are ready to contribute  their post-published articles in the IR, in case their  university  mandates  them  to  do  this.  But  the  same  percentage  is  dropping  down  (19.15  %)  hugely  when  the  question  arises  for  contributing  pre- published  or  work-in-progress  articles.  They  want  to publish new contents in any reputed journal first.  The  percentage  of  agreed  professors  (54.17  %)  in  this  regard,  is  much  more,  than  the  other  than  professors  (47.83  %).

4.4 Incentives  of  IR 
There  are  many  benefits  that  IR  holds  for  academic  institutions  and  their  faculty  members.  It  provides institutions with the opportunity to collect,  store and disseminate institutional intellectual output,  bring visibility to the university as well as individual  faculty.  In  this  survey  option  of  eight  different  incentives  of  IR  were  given  to  the  respondents.  These  are: 
(a) It  increases  professional  visibility 
(b) It  measures  of  faculty  performance 
(c) It  improves  scholarly  communication 
(d) It  is  easy  to  use 
(e) It  is  a  permanent  place  for  scholarly  content (f) It  support  class  room  teaching 
(g) It  display  intellectual  achievement  of  the  
institute 
(h) It  provide  easy  access  of  gray  literature 
However,  the  respondents  opted  for  only  five  such  incentives,  as  mentioned  in  Table  6. 
54.17  %  professors  and  65.22  %  other  than  professors  think  the  professional  visibility  as  the  most  important  benefit  of  an  IR  then  came  the  intellectual  achievement  of  the  institute.

So it may be concluded that faculty members are  very  much  interested  in  their  professional  visibility.  The  professors  and  the  other  than  professors  are  more  or  less  in  the  same  view  in  these  regards. 4.5 Awareness  about  dual  Copyright  or  
Alternative  publishing Agreement 
The issues of copyright and dual copyright have  already been emphasised. Copyright is the authors  control  over  the  content  but  this  right  is  generally  transferred  to  the  publisher  with  the  consent  for  publication  through  any  publishing  channel.  Dual  copyright  at  the  same  time  allows  the  author  to  retain  the  copyright  to  the  work.  In  this  survey  the  awareness  about  dual  copyright  issue  among  the  faculty  members  under  study  was  examined. 
  According  to  Table  7  it  is  revealed  that  one  fourth  of  respondents  were  aware  about  the  dual  copyright issues. Both the professors and other than  professors  are  more  or  less  on  the  same  level  in  this  regard.  Faculties  who  don’t  want  (or  not  sure)  to  contribute  their  content  in  IR  have  fear  about  copyright  issue.

Professors others Total Aware  5 (20.83)  4 (17.39)  9 (19.15) Not aware 19 (79.17) 19 (82.61) 38 (80.85) Total 24 (100) 23 (100) 47 (100) 
5. ConClUSIonS 
Faculty’s attitude towards IR is generally positive.  Regarding the awareness of IR, it was found that half  of the respondents are positive. Overall, the findings  showed that incentive factors are more influential for  participation in IR. Any form of awareness programme  in this regard would be beneficial in increasing the  interest  to  participate.  Faculty  members  who  are  
296 
willing  to  contribute  to  the  IR  in  future  realised  potential benefits they could get in contributing their  contents  in  this  regard.  The  copyright  issue  is  the  most influential factors in regard to the unwillingness  of the contribution. Most of the faculty respondents  are unaware about dual copyright or dual licensing  policies  of  the  publishers. According  to  the  faculty  members all the copyright issues, including the dual  copyright or multi licensing policy should be handled  by  the  University  authorities.  That  is  why  they  are  in  favour  of  ‘Mediated  deposit  service  model’,  i.e.,  the agencies interested in establishment or maintain  an IR must prepare an appropriate licensing policy  in  this  regard.  There  are  many  IR  in  action  but  the  licensing  policy  is  in  a  void  situation  as  far  as  Indian  conditions  are  concerned.
