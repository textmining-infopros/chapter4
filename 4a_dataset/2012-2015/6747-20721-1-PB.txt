In Arabic 3 newspapers also  have English version, in addition 2 more newspapers were in English only. Further, 4 websites were not  working.

1. INtrOdUctION 
Saudi Arabia is also known as Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia (KSA), which was founded by King Abdulaziz  Al-Saud.  The  KSA  is  world’s  largest  oil  exporter  that’s  why  the  main  source  of  economy  of  KSA  is  oil-based.  Now,  KSA  is  a  nation  that  is  looking  to  and preparing for a different kind of future, a future  that’s  more  inclusive,  expansive,  sustainable,  and  integrated  on  both  economic  and  social  levels;  a  future that revolves around investment. In addition,  new communications infrastructures, new transport  routes, state-of-the-art industrial complexes, dynamic  training opportunities and a commitment to greater  business  efficiencies  are  there. 
The KSA online newspapers are popular among  many sections of Saudi society, including nationals  and  foreign  residents,  and  from  various  socio- economic  levels. 
The internet has revolutionised development in  newspaper  publishing.  Online  newspapers  helped  in  increasing  frequency  and  create  platform  for  sharing  information  more  quickly  across  globe.  It  has  helped  to  bring  the  people  together  in  more  dynamic  interactive  manner1. 
Social  media  is  based  upon  the  software  that  facilitate  people  to  connect,  collaborate,  and  form  virtual  communities  via  internet.  Normally  social  network  sites  are  full  of  features,  which  allow  the  
user community to send messages, post comments,  share audio and video files, take part in live chats,  etc.2 
Social  media  (e.g.,  Facebook,  Twitter,  and  YouTube) are changing the way individuals consume  and  share  news.  Specifically,  a  news  item  can  be  distributed  across  societies  and  discussed  by  people  around  the  world  within  minutes  via  social  media  platforms3. 
While  social  media  shares  traditional  media’s  functions of providing news stories to users, differences  exist  between  social  media  and  traditional  media  in  terms  of  the  relationships  between  users  and  news. The social media users actively participate in  producing news content by submitting links or news  stories  from  various  sources4.  Social  media  made  journalism  more  effective  as  helping  tremendously  to  disseminate  information  to  individual  user  in  minimum  span  of  time. 
2. LIterAtUre revIew 
Some previous published studies on adoption of  social networking by online newspapers in worldwide ,  that  played  a  foundation  to  this  work,  have  been  done. 
Ahmad5, et al.  in their study found that Facebook  and  Twitter  were  the  two  most  familiar  web  2.0  tools. They also revealed that the Kingdom’s private  universities  have  more  consistency.

Lee & Ma3  in their study found that recent events  indicated  that  sharing  news  in  social  media  has  become a phenomenon of increasing social, economic  and  political  importance  because  individuals  can  now participate in news production and diffusion in  large  global  virtual  communities. Authors  designed  and  administered  a  survey  to  203  students  in  a  large  local  university,  and  results  revealed  that  respondents  who  were  driven  by  gratifications  of  information seeking, socialising, and status seeking  were  more  likely  to  share  news  in  social  media  platforms  from  structural  equation  modeling  (SEM)  analysis. 
Peterson6   in  his  study  revealed  that  adoption  of  communication  forms,  like,  Twitter  presents  students  of  congressional  behaviur  an  interesting  case to examine the intersection of technology and  politics.  Author  examined  Twitter  use  in  the  111th Congress  to  better  understand  congressional  early  adoption  of  new  technology.  The  primary  question  addressed was, what systematic determinants shape  the  decision  to  adopt  Twitter  as  a  component  of  an MC’s media strategy? using data collected from  MC  Twitter  accounts  and  the  2008  congressional  election,  found  partisan,  cohort,  and  ideological  determinants  on  early  Twitter  adoption. 
Erdelez  &  Rioux7   in  their  study  found  that  many  websites  included  buttons  or  links  (sharing  tools)  that  allow  users  to  conveniently  share  news  stories  and  other  information  with  friends,  family
