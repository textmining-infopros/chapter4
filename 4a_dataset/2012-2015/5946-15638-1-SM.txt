 The  study  was  conducted  to  evaluate  user  needs  and  awareness  of  aspects  of  evidence-based  medicine (EBM) resources – their features, utility, and the areas covered under various facets of clinical  practice  and  patient  care  by  the  clinicians  (faculty  members  and  postgraduate  students)  of  Kasturba  Medical College (KMC), Manipal. The EBM resources provide the expertise and practical knowledge of  top physicians, researchers and leading academic experts worldwide, and KMC health sciences library  subscribe various EBM resources. The data collection was performed using self-administered questionnaire  to faculty members and postgraduate students from eight clinical departments of KMC, and included a  total of 74 participants. Evaluating the different EBM resources at work revealed that ‘UpToDate’, ‘PubMed/ Medline’, and ‘MD Consult’ always came frst in user-preference. The results of data analysis and summary  of  responses  and  suggestions  for  effective  utilisation  of  the  EBM  resources  gathered  from  the  survey  are  presented. The  outcomes  pointed  that  clinicians  possessed  awareness  of  several  EBM  resources  subscribed  by  KMC  Health  Sciences  Library  as  well  as  from  the  external  sources. The  summarised  data and the ideas gathered from the survey are helpful to propose a few suitable recommendations for  effective utilisation of the EBM resources available in the KMC Health Sciences Library.

The  term  ‘Evidence-based  Medicine’  (EBM)  was  introduced  by  Gordon  Guyatt1.  Since  then,  it  has  become  an  increasingly  pervasive  term  in  healthcare-related areas. The EBM is defined as ‘the  integration  of  best  research  evidence  with  clinical  expertise  and  patient  values’2.  The  EBM  focuses  upon  a  disease–based  model  of  decision  making,  whereas evidence-based health-care is focused on  flexibility in choice of methods and its similar service  models. The EBM tries to reduce dependence upon  the  traditional  medical  model  of  expert  authority  of  accumulated  clinical  experience. 
It  helps  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  clinicians  by  identifying  resource-intensive  maneuvers  for  adoption  with  minimal  expenditure  of  time.  It  also  provides  identical  strategies  that  can  be  followed  by  undergraduate  and  postgraduate  education,  as  well  as  continuing  medical  education  (CME)  for  professionals.  Four  important  steps  in  EBM  are: • Formulate  a  clear  clinical  question  from  a  
patient’s  problem 
• Search  the  literature  for  relevant  clinical  
articles 
Received 26 August 2013, online published 17 January 2014 
• Evaluate  (critically  appraise)  the  evidence  for  
its  validity  and  usefulness 
• Implement  useful  findings  in  clinical  practice 
The  EBM  database  provide  sound  basis  for  eliminating anecdotal and uncertain information. The  EBM  resources  provide  the  expertise  and  practical  knowledge  of  top  physicians  and  researchers  from  leading  academic  and  medical  centres  worldwide.  
Following  are  some  of  the  EBM  resources  available  for  the  clinicians: 
• UpToDate:  It is an evidence-based, physician- 
authored  clinical  knowledge  system  which  
clinicians  trust  to  make  the  right  point-of-care  
decisions3.  It  is  an  online  clinical  decision  
support  system  assisting  clinicians  throughout  
the  world  provide  the  best  patient  care.  It  is  
a  clinical  information  resource  which  offers  
fully referenced expert answers to patient-care,  
diagnosis and treatment questions. Topic reviews  
are written by recognised authorities who review  
the topic, synthesise the evidence, summarise key  
findings and provide specific recommendations • MD Consult: It offers the comprehensive information  
available  in  one  convenient  online  resource.

It  comprises  full-text  articles  from  over  80  medical journals and clinics, 50 leading medical  references  across  a  wide  range  of  specialties,  clinically  relevant  drug  information,  and  over  15,000  patient  handouts,  etc. 
Cochrane  Library  Online:  It  is  a  single  source  of reliable evidence about the effects of health- care. It contains all existing systematic reviews  plus  increasingly  wider  range  of  new  updated  reviews.  
PubMed/MEDLINE:  It includes abstracts, short  technical  summaries  of  more  than  22  million  scientific  articles  in  medicine  and  health.  BMJ  Best  Practice:  It  is  a  new  concept  for  information  delivered  at  the  point  of  care.  It  provides up-to-date, fast and reliable information  to healthcare professionals while making diagnosis  and treatment decisions. The sources combined  the latest research evidence, guidelines and expert  opinion–presented  in  a  step-by-step  approach,  covering  prevention,  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  prognosis. 
BMJ  Case  Report:  It  published  a  high  volume  of  cases  in  all  disciplines  so  that  healthcare  professionals, researchers and others can easily  find clinically important information on common  and  rare  conditions.

and  the  most  requested  improvements  to  clinical  information  resources. 
Bonis6, et al.  pointed out that hospitals with access  to ‘UpToDate’ were associated with significantly better  performance  than  other  hospitals.  This  indicates  that  electronic-clinical  knowledge  support  systems  have  decreased  barriers  to  answering  clinical  questions. 
Lucas7, et al.  in their study revealed that searching  the  EBM  literature  could  improve  the  treatment  of  many  medical  inpatients,  including  those  already  receiving evidence-based treatment. The study also  shows that attending physicians changed treatment  of  eligible  patients  as  a  result  of  the  literature  searches. Lockwood8, et al.  reveiled that incorporation  of EBM meetings into routine practice has resulted  in  treatment  guidelines  being  more  closely  based  on  published  evidence  and  improvements  to  care  of  patients. 
According  to  Sackett9   adopting  the  practice  of  EBM resources, is believed to significantly improve  the primary care and evidence-based practice also  supports decision-making shared with users, which  is already favoured within the medical community as  the ideal of decision making. Verhoeven & Schuling10 indicated that an evidence-based answering service  can  have  an  impact  on  GPs,  and  their  patients.  
McColl11,  et  al.   in  their  study  suggested  that  
the  EBM  practitioners,  a  few  examples  are: • Medscape  Reference 
• Annals  of  Internal  Medicine:  ACP  Journal  
Club 
• Database  of  Abstracts  of  Reviews  of  Effect  
(DARE) 
• National  Guideline  Clearinghouse  • DynaMed 
There  are  many  EBM  resources  available  for  
clinicians  welcomed  EBM,  and  agreed  that  its  
practice improves patient care. Rosenberg & Donald12,

Several  studies  have  examined  the  value  and  contribution of EBM resources for helping clinicians  in  patient  care  and  faster  decision  making  as  well  as sharing experience in the community of medical  professionals. 
Akobeng4   explains  the  concept  of  EBM  and  introduces the five step EBM model: (a) formulation  of  answerable  clinical  questions;  (b)  searching  for  evidence;  critical  appraisal;  (c)  applicability  of  evidence;  and  (d)  evaluation  of  performance.  The  main concern is to provide a practical demonstration  of the five step EBM model using a real-life clinical  scenario. Ely5, et al.  suggested that clinical resource  developers could use the recommendations made by  practicing  physicians  to  provide  resources  that  are  more useful for answering clinical questions. This is  to  identify  the  most  frequent  obstacles  preventing  physicians from answering their patient-care questions  
58 
discussesed  EBM  as  a  process  of  turning  clinical  problems  into  questions  and  then  systematically  locating,  appraising,  and  using  contemporaneous  research findings as the basis for clinical decisions.  The  computerisation  of  bibliographies  and  the  development  of  software  that  permits  the  rapid  location of relevant evidence have made it easier for  busy  clinicians  to  make  best  use  of  the  published  literature. Another problem discussed is that Medline  and the other e-databases used for finding relevant  evidence are not comprehensive and are not always  well  indexed  and  even  a  lengthy  literature  search  is  fruitless.  For  some  older  doctors  the  computer  skills needed for using databases regularly may also  seem to be challenging. Kim13, et al.  showed that an  EBM  curriculum  focused  on  critical  appraisal  skills  and  use  of  evidence-based  resources  significantly  improved  EBM  knowledge  and  changed  resident  use  of  information  resources. 
Drug Week editors, staff, and reporters summarises  that  ‘UpToDate’  is  an  evidence-based  resource  providing fast, accurate clinical answers to physicians  and  other  medical  professionals  at  the  point  of  care14. Close-Up Media15, in their study revealed that  ‘UpToDate’ decision support is a customisable order  set authoring and management solution that provides  integration  into  clinical  processes  to  streamline

the  delivery  of  standardised  care  for  improved  patient safety, outcomes, clinician performance and  regulatory  compliance.  
 Another study pointed out that numerous studies  demonstrated clinical value of ‘UpToDate’ 
16.  These  new findings support dozens of previous studies which  demonstrate ‘UpToDate’ answers clinical questions,  improves patient care and improves hospital outcomes.  McKibbon & Bayley17  suggested that clinicians need  more  skills  in  efficiently  and  effectively  finding  the  materials  they  need  for  evidence-based  practice. 
The  review  of  literature  reveals  that  clinicians  welcomed EBM and agreed that it helps to improve  patient  care.

The  major  findings  of  the  study  are: 
6.1 Awareness  about  EbM  Resources 
Study  observed  that  44.6  %  to  93.2  %  of  respondents were aware of various EBM resources  available  in  the  KMC  Health  Sciences  Library.  Of  this least number of respondents (44.6 %) indicated  awareness  about  BMJ  Case  Reports.  Majority  of  the  participants  (94.6  %)  were  aware  of  PubMed/ MEDLINE resource. This shows that the participants  were  familiar  with  PubMed  EBM  resource  before  library subscribed to other evidence-based resources.  Study  also  reveals  that  85.1  %  of  participants  were  aware  of  UpToDate  EBM  resource  which  the

library  started  subscription  from  the  year  2012.  This  indicated  that  the  clinicians  were  eager  to  use  new  EBM  resources  for  updating  information  available  in  their  field.  Table  1  gives  more  details  in  this  regard. 
6.2 Most  Preferred  EbM  Resources 
The  study  revealed  that  most  preferred  EBM  resource  by  a  vast  majority  of  respondents  was  UpToDate  by  45.9  %  (Table  2).  The  increase  in  preference  and  awareness  of  UpToDate  shows  the  importance  of  this  resource  in  clinical  practice  and  patient care. The study further indicated that 24.3 %  of respondents most preferred MD Consult whereas  23  %  most  preferred  PubMed/MEDLINE. 
6.3 Frequency  of  Utilisation  EbM  Resources  in  
Work 
Table  3  shows  that  clinicians  were  used  EBM  resources  daily,  except  Cochrane  Library  Online.   UpToDate was accessed daily by more participants.  All participants were used EBM resources at least 2-3  times a week. This revealed the important of using  EBM resources in patient care, diagnosis, reference and  studies. One of the objectives of the study to assess  the  utility  of  ‘EBM’  resources  in  day  to  day  patient  care  by  the  physicians,  is  met  by  this  outcome. 6.4 Competence  in  Using  EbM  Resources 
Evaluation of competence in using EBM resources  was included in the study. 52.7 % of the respondents

selected  EBM  resources  for  their  work  because  of  reliability  of  source  of  information  whereas  28.4  %  supported it for the accuracy of content. Least number  of  respondents  considered  the  availability  of  peer  reviewed  data  as  the  basis  of  their  choice. 6.7 Assessment  of  Content  Updating  of  EbM  
Resources 
Study revealed that 60.8 % of participants agreed  that EBM resources is updating its content for current  translational research, case studies, diagnosis and  other  relevant  information  (Table  9).    At  the  same  time,  17.6  %  participants  strongly  agreed  to  this.  
6.8   i mpact  of  EbM  Resources  in  Clinical  
decision  Making 
Table  10  shows  the  participants’  opinion  about  impact  of  EBM  resources  on  aspects  of  clinical  decision  making  such  as  speed  of  decision  taking,  reduction  of  barriers  to  finding  answers,  improving  decision  making  in  new  cases,  etc.  It  is  found  that  more  participants  (50  %)  were  of  the  opinion  that  EBM  resources  decreased  barriers  to  answering  clinical  questions.  This  reveals  the  immense  utility  of  the  resource  for  the  above  purpose  at  the  point  of  clinical  decision  making.

resources  were  associated  with  significantly  better  performance than other hospitals’ clearly supporting  the outcome. The study also showed that 6.8 % of  participants  suggested  that  the  number  of  patients  examined  have  increased  and  the  least  number  of  the participants agreed with the view that its usage  shortened the hospital stay of patients. Respondents  in  each  category  indicated  the  impact  of  EBM  resources  in  all  area  of  clinical  practice. 
6.9 Analysis  of  EbM  Resources  Standards  of  
Excellence 
Majority of the participants agreed that standards of  excellence expected by the clinicians were met by EBM  resources (Table 11) whereas 17.6 % of the participants  ‘strongly agreed’ with this view. The data collected in  relation to EBM resources, without doubt, indicated  to  the  standards  of  excellence  of  the  resource. 6.10Evaluation  of  EbM  Resources  for  
Enhancing  Patient  Care/Hospital  Quality  
The  study  found  that  EBM  resources  enhance  patient  care  as  well  as  hospital  quality  (Table  12)  from  the  response  of  participants.  The  view  was  shared  by  Lockwood8, et  al.  in  their  study.  In  this

28.4 % supported UpToDate and 27 % supported MD  Consult. Evaluating the different EBM resources at  work also revealed that UpToDate, PubMed/Medline  and  MD  Consult  always  came  first  in  prefernce.

SUGGEStionS 
It is important to highlight the main features of  each EBM resources that are required to guide  the  users  and  to  train  them  on  how  to  access  these  features.  There  are  various  means  to  communicate  this  information,  viz.,  display  of  posters highlighting EBM resources through the  notice boards of the library and various medical  departments,  through  bulletin  boards,  posters  at strategic locations as well as video clippings  made  available  through  the  intranet  portal. There  is  a  need  for  conducting  more  sessions  on  information  literacy  for  creating  awareness  on  EBM  resources  available  in  the  KMC  HSL.  These sessions on the relevant EBM resources  should be held preferably at the various clinical  departments  of  KMC,  Manipal  to  increase  participation  of  clinicians  and  postgraduates. Suggestions  made  by  postgraduates  indicate  necessity  for  addressing  the  specific  requests

The  study  on  the  evaluation  of  importance  of  the  different  EBM  resources  by  the  respondents  at their work indicated that 43.2 % rated PubMed/ Medline  and  39.2  %  rated  UpToDate  in  the  highly  important  category.  37.8  %  rated  MD  Consult  and  23  %  Cochrane  Library  in  this  category.  Least  importance  has  been  given  to  BMJ  Best  Practice  by  12.2  %.

Training  the  staff  members  of  the library, to equip them to meet the challenge  is  a  priority. 
Provision  of  mobile  alert  can  be  employed  as  a  mechanism  for  more  effective  means  of  disseminating  information  pertaining  to  the  EBM  resources,  their  access  or  the  literacy  sessions  and  updates.  Highlights  pertaining  to  EBM  resources  could  also  be  e-mailed  to  the  medical community of all departments for wider  circulation.

There is a need to install more computers at the  reference section for accessing EBM resources.  This will help to collect supplementary information  while  consulting  textbooks  for  referencing. Individual  training  sessions  may  be  provided  by  the  library  to  those  among  clinicians  who  may  require  supplementing  the  computer  skills  
needed  for  accessing  the  databases,  for  their  6.

maximal  utilisation. 
Collection  of  regular  feedback  of  users  at  definite points of time through e-mail and other  means  to  identify  user  awareness,  perception  and  needs  is  of  importance. 
8. ConCLUSionS 
The  outcome  of  the  survey  highlights  various  aspects of user perception, awareness and requisites  for the use of EBM resources and its role in various  facets  of  clinical  practice.  The  finding  from  the  study  pointed  to  the  fact  that  clinicians  possessed  awareness of several EBM resources subscribed by  KMC  Health  Sciences  Library  (HSL)  and  also  from  the external sources. The respondents were keenly  interested  in  exploring  the  newly  available  EBM  resources in the KMC HSL for procuring information  pertaining to clinical decision making from the updates  of  current  translational  research,  case  studies,  diagnosis  and  other  relevant  information.  This  is  evident  from  the  high  response  of  the  clinicians  to  ‘UpToDate’  resource  that  is  being  subscribed  only  from  the  year  2012,  as  shown  by  the  preference  for  it  and  the  daily  usage.  
The  KMC  HSL  has  many  subscribed  EBM  resources, from various publishing groups that have  been  proven  useful  in  patient  care  and  treatment.  The  initiatives  to  provide  awareness  to  the  users,  enhancing their search skills and other appropriate  steps  to  achieve  the  goal  of  optimal  utilisation  of  EBM  resources  available  at  the  KMC  HSL  by  the  medical  community,  is  an  ongoing  effort.  In  this  regards,  the  KMC  HSL  makes  its  contribution  to  the  accomplishment  of  the  mission  and  goals  that  its  parent  organisation  had  set  to  achieve.
