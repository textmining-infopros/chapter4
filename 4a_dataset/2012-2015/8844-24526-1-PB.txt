AbSTrACT 
The Chhattisgarh State was formed in 2001 carved out from the then Madhya Pradesh. Ever since  its establishment as a fully fedged state, a considerable number of academic institutions have sprung- up.  To  promote  education  a  Indian  Institute  of  Management  (IIM)  and All  India  Institute  of  Medical  Sciences (AIIMS) have been established along with universities and colleges. As libraries are heart of  any institution,  present study attempts to analyse the status of libraries in various academic institutions  of Chhattisgarh with emphasis on status of automation and ICT applications and use. Survey method was  followed to collect the data and six libraries were selected for detailed analysis. There are one central  university, one state university, one special university, one open university, along with NIT and IIM. The  results indicate that all libraries are discharging their services with functional library buildings. However,  their collection is uneven and staff strength is less. Most of the libraries are yet to develop any collection  development policies and still collection of non-book materials is very less. Although most of the libraries  have implemented automation either by using Libsys or SOUL, staff of the libraries have required skill  to  handle  various  bugs  in  using  software.  Digitisation  of  collection  is  not  well  adopted  in  most  of  the  libraries.To excel in services, staff training and staff appointment seem to be urgent need of these libraries.

1. INTrODUCTION 
The  word  ‘Chhattisgarh’,  is  a  combination  of  two  terms,  i.e.,‘Chhattis’  and  ‘Garh’  means  land  of  36  forts.  The  State  was  formed  on  1  November  2000 carved from Madya Pradesh state.1  Presently,   Chhattisgarh has 27 districts with 5 divisions 
 2 
  and  spread  over  135,  190  sq-km.  As  per  2011  censes  the  literacy  rate  of  Chhattisgarh  is  71.04  %  which  ranks 27th  among the states in India 
3. This possibly  may  be  because  of  less  number  of  educational  institutions  in  the  State.  The  existing  institutions  are  struggling  to  provide  even  basic  infrastructure  facilities  like  libraries  to  support  learning.  It  is  well  known that the libraries are true learning centres of  education, which support the acquisition of knowledge  and  skills.  Nyamboga4   in  his  study  reported  that  libraries  and  LIS  professionals  are  great  help  in  providing  information  literacy  skills  training  to  the  users  to  use  available  resources  in  the  library. 
Libraries  are  an  integral  part  of  and  have  an  imperative  role  in  the  functioning  of  an  academic  and  research  organisation. They  provide  academic  support  to  the  users  of  an  academic  institution.  According  to  Annual  Status  of  Education  Report  (ASER)5  report, 10.5 % of primary schools are don’t

have  a  library,  63.3  %  of  schools  have  a    library  but  are  not  being  used  by  students  in  the  State.  There  are  only  26.2  %  of  schools  that  have  library  and  are  being  used  by  students  in  Chhattisgarh.  As per 7th  AISES (2007) report 77.24 % secondary  schools  and  89.59  %  higher  secondary  schools  in  India  where  library  facility  exists.  In  contrast,  33.05  %  of  secondary  schools  and  65.44  %  of  higher  secondary  schools  in  Chhattisgarh,library  facility  exists6.  Presently,  there  are  106  AICTE- approved institutions (2014-15)7, and 175 government  degree  colleges.8   There  are  12  state  universities,  7  private  universities  and  1  central  university9.  Few  institutions  of  national  importance  and  some  research institutions are working with the existence  of  libraries  in  Chhattisgarh. 
The Chhattisgarh Public Library Act was enacted  in  2008,  however,  it  is  yet  to  be  implemented10.  The  Act  has  recommended  establishing  two  state  level  libraries,  i.e.,  State  Central  Library  and  State  Reference Library in Raipur and Bilaspur respectively.  It also states that every district should have a district  library  acting  as  apex  body  for  district  libraries.  Finance is the key concern for public libraries.States  like  Tamil  Nadu11,  Karnataka12   collect  library  cess

on  property  tax.  Kerala  reserved  1  %  of  the  total  education  budget  for  upliftment  of  public  libraries;  and  Goa  collects  library  cess  on  liquor.  However,  there is no provision of library cess in Chhattisgarh  Public  Library  Act.  There  is  provision  of  budget  allocation  for  public  libraries  in  five  year  plan  and  non  plan  budgets.13 
2.  rEVIEW  OF  rELATED  LITErATUrE 
The library scenario of Chhattisgarh is not well  discussed so far. While PSG Kumar14  explained the  development  and  movement  of  public  libraries  in  Chhattisgarh,  Kaur  &  Walia15   mentioned  that  LIS  schools  are  provided  and  have  pro-vital  role  in  development  of  skilled  professionals  in  the  State.  In  terms  of  different  types  of  libraries,  Chopra    &  Mukherjee16   argued  the  need  of  networking  among  academic libraries as an important step for overcoming  the  resource  access  barriers  among  libraries  of  the  then  Madhya  Pradesh.  However,  lack  of  funds  for  establishing  such  network  were  identified  as  a  hurdle.  In  terms  of  school  libraries  Bhandarkar17 discussed that condition of secondary school library  are too poor in Chhattisgarh state. 33.0 % schools  don’t  have  any  library  set-up.  In  terms  of  special  libraries,  Pandya18   in  his  study  mentioned  that  although  agricultural  libraries  in  the  State  are  in  initial  stage  of  development,  they  are  prosperous  in  the  state. Ahmed19   in  his  study  pointed  that  for  a  state  like  Chhattisgarh,  the  implication  of  ICT  in  libraries  although  leads  to  new  horizon,  lack  of  personnel skills, willingness among professionals and  their training, support from the authorities to execute  the  policies  are,  however,  few  drawbacks.  Ahmed   &  Tomar20     in  their  study  mentioned  the  usage  of  social  networking  sites  to  improve  the  conditions  of  libraries  in  a  State  like  Chhattisgarh. 
3.  ObJECTIVES  
academic  libraries  of  the  State  were  scanned.  However,  because  of  the  fact  that  most  of  the  academic  libraries  in  this  region  still  don’t  have  any  individual  webpage.  it  was  difficult  to  expand  the  study  in  this  direction.  
Hence,  for  fulfilment  of  set  objectives  of  this  study, survey method was found suitable. A structured  close-ended  questionnaire  were  developed  and  distributed to all librarians of the academic libraries  of  higher  education  of  Chhattisgarh.  In  spite  of  repeated  efforts,  only  six  libraries  returned  the  questionnaires.The  study  is  done  on  the  basis  of  data  received  from  six  academic  libraries.

5. ANALYSIS AND  INTErPrETATION 
5.1 Infrastructural  Facilities 
Table  1  shows  the  available  infrastructure  of  identified libraries. All identified libraries have separate  library  buildings  to  discharge  services.  Although,  preservation  and  conservation  of  documents  are  essential aspects of maintenance, apart from PRSU, no  other  library  has  attached  bindery  for  repair  of

(b) Understand the extent of ICT facilities available

(c) Suggest possible improvements for the libraries  
in  the  state. 
4.  METHODOLOGY 
To  fulfill  the  objectives  the  websites  of  various   
are  not  satisfactory.  Almost  1/3rd  (33.58  %)  posts  lying  are  vacant.  In  the  present  scenario  when  the  users  have  diversified  needs  and  libraries  are  attempting  their  best,  shortage  of  staff  may  be  the  greatest  hindrance  towards  performing  quality  service.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  that,  the  higher  authorities of this institution should take necessary  steps to recruit the vacant positions in the libraries.  The  highest  number  of  personnel  (29)  is  working  in  PRSU  and  lowest  number  (5)  in  IIM.  It  is  also  noticed from Table 1 that IIM and IGKV libraries are  running with 44.44 % and 41.67 % shortage of staff  respectively.  Most  of  the  working  personnel  are

Table 2 reveals that the libraries are kept open  for  users  at  least  for  9  hours  (IGKV,  CVRU)  or  up  to  13  hours  (IIM).

higher in general academic libraries than specialised  academic libraries.For the purpose of classifying the  documents  Dewey  Decimal  Classification  scheme  (DDC)  is  adopted  in  NIT,  GGU,  CVRU,  PRSU  and  IIM libraries. Whereas, IGKV, being a special library,  uses  Universal  Decimal  Classification  (UDC).  For  the  purpose  of  cataloguing  the  documents  AACR  is adopted in every library, except CVRU where no  cataloguing  scheme  is  used.  For  accessing  library  collection, OPAC is being used in GGU and PRSU,  Web OPAC in IIM, and both OPAC and Web OPAC in

NIT and IGKV libraries. Common facilities like lending,  reprography, and internet access are provided in all  libraries.  However,  reservation  of  documents  and  printing  facilities  are  not  provided  in  few  libraries.  It is interesting to note that traditional services like  display  of  new  arrivals,  current  awareness  service    (CAS), reference service, lending of books are still  in use in most of the libraries but document delivery  service  (DDS),  referral  service,  abstracting  and  indexing  services,  and  inter-library  loan  services  are missing in services. The possible reasons may  be  inadequate  staff. 
5.3 Collection  Development  Policies  and  
Issues 
From Table  3,  it  is  clear  that  the  budget  of  IIM  is  more  than  double  than  that  of  central  university  (GGV) and the well developed state-funded (IGKV).  The state-funded library PRSU has much less funds  which  is  a  matter  of  concern.  Libraries  like  IGKV,  IIM follow diverse policies to acquire collection and  taking  users’  need  from  administrator  to  research  scholars to build library collection. However, demand  from research scholars and request of students are  not considered for collection development in GGU &  CVRU.  So  far,  IIM  has  lower  amount  of  collections  (<10,000)  than  other  4  selected  libraries.  Possible  reasons  may  be  the  IIM  is  comparatively  newer

than  other  organisations.  The  amount  of  other  collections like audio books, periodicals, databases  &  e-journals,  and  back  volumes  available  in  these  libraries  are  mentioned  in  Table  3.  
5.4 Status  of Automation  and  ICT  Use 
The uses of  information communication technology  (ICT)  in  libraries  enhances  services  in  time  to  its  users.    As  libraries  are  one  of  the  important  services sector of the society, an attempt has been  made  to  know  how  far  ICTs  are  implemented  in  academic libraries of Chhattisgarh, what extent the  professionals (at least Assistant Librarians & above)  are  well  accustomed  with  handing  ICT,  what  type  of  support  they  are  receiving  for  ICT  enactment  and  what  problems  they  are  so  far  facing.  Table  4  displays  the  status  of  ICT  in  academic  libraries.  
As  indicated  in  Table  4,  specialised  academic  libraries  (IIM  and  NIT)  are  using  commercialised  LibSys software and general academic libraries using  INFLIBNET’s SOUL for their house-keeping operations.  The open source software, KOHA, is being used in  IGKV  for  library  automation.  It  is  important  to  note  that, although library professionals are accustomed  with day-to-day used software, personnel, however,  are  unavailable  for  handling  linux,  web  designing,  programming, etc. Presently, the day-to-day problems  are  being  solved  by  getting  technical  support  from

suppliers  and  consultants.  Outsourcing  is  yet  to  a  phenomena  in  these  libraries.  Furthermore,  the  library staff of IIM don’t have any constraint in using  their  LibSys  software,  however,  staff  of  GGU  has  issue in using the software SOUL. Libraries showed  their  willingness  to  handle  challenges,  but  lack  of  ICT skills and less manpower are major constraints  while  operating  the  software  in  libraries.  However,  training  to  staff  are  not  conducted  to  overcome  such  constraints.  
277 
5.5 Status  of  Digitisation 
No library in the world is self-sufficient. Because  of  diversified  users’  need  enrolling  a  library  under  an  existing  network  system,  probably,  overcomes  problems  of  resource  crunch  to  some  extent.  The  same scenario is observed in libraries of Chhattisgarh  where  libraries  are  serving  better  being  a  member  of either INFLIBNET or AICT or CERA and providing  access to wide resource through IP authentication.  However,  the  private  university  CVRU  is  yet  to  

========5========

                  G URIKAR  & M UKHERJEE: INFORMATION  T ECHNOLOGy USAGE  S CENARIO IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES 
enrol  under  any  digital  consortium.  In  Table  3  it  is  identified  that  IIM  don’t  have  considerable  number  of  print  collections,  however,  as  indicated  in  Table  5,  library  have  access  to  quite  high  number  of  (15000+) online journals. The progress of digitisation  of  theses  and  dissertations  under  Shodhganga  project  is  less  in  case  of  GGU  as  compared  to  PSRU  and  IGKV.  The  possible  reason  may  be  the  lack  of  staff.  
6.  FINDINGS  &  CONCLUSIONS 
The  following  findings  are  drawn: 
(a)  Libraries of the most of the institutions function  
with  basic  infrastructure.  However,  scarcity  of  
personnel  is  common.  To  excel  in  need-based  
services,  it  is  important  that  staff  should  be  
adequate. For maintaining existing services and  
adding  new  services,  skilled  staff  is  essential.  
In  spite  of  the  fact  that  present  day  libraries  
become  more  virtual,  staff  is  still  needed  for  
maintaining  all  services  in  addition  to  virtual  
set-up. 
(b)  Budget  is  another  important  pre-requisite  for  
enhancing  library  services,  collection,  etc.  
However,  the  budget  provision  of  the  state-  
funded  universities  is  quite  low  of  this  region. 
(c)  To develop balanced collections, recommendation  
from  all  sections  of  library  users  are  essential.  
However, most of the universities follow proto-type  
policies for developing collections and they don’t  
feel it essential to accept recommendation from  
research  scholars,  students  or  administrators.  
Most  of  the  library  have  their  collection  mainly  
in  books  or  back  volumes  of  journals.  Other  
resources such as non-book materials, standard and  
patterns, theses and dissertations, are  very less. 
(d)  Keeping  pace  with  present  needs,  most  of  the  
libraries have already automated their libraries.  
Lack  of  software-handling  skills,  and  fear  of  
using software are common among staff of the  
libraries. To overcome such scenario, continous  
training of library personnel is essential. Further,  
it  is  well  depicted  in  the  results  that  libraries  
using  LibSys  software  have  more  facilities  
of  automating  library  jobs  while  libraries  
using  SOUL  have  limited  options.  Therefore,  
it  is  important  that  software  provider  should  
consider  this  issue  seriously  otherwise  their  
demand  will  likely  to  be  less  in  near  future. 
(e)  The  number  of  accessible  online  journals  is  
highest  in  IIM,  probably  because  of  that  they  
do  not  have  enough  collection  of  print  books.  
This  is  followed  by  GGU  and  PSRU. Although,  GGU is a central university and PSRy  is one of  the  oldest  university  in  the  State,  their  access  facility  is  still  quite  less.  The  university  should  take it seriously and should channel their budget  more  towards  subscribing  journals  for  their  clients  or  approaching  INFLIBNET  to  increase  the accessibility of their online journal database.  On  the  other  hand,  in  digitisation  of  theses,  IGKV  is  far  ahead  than  other  libraries  like  PSRU  (2354)  and  GGV  (100).    Probably,  non- adequacy  of  staff  is  one  of  the  reason.
