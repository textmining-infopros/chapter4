Scientometric  is  an  academic  discipline  and  much research is being carried out for a quantitative  study of the various aspects of literature of a given  subject. It is a branch of information science which  analyses quantitatively the published information based  on  bibliographic  data  elements.  The  scientometric  analysis has received adequate attention in the recent  years  and  it  has  been  widely  applied  to  evaluate  the research performance of the scientists and the  growth  of  various  disciplines  of  science.  Further,  Scientometric  could  be  used  in  the  identification  of  emerging  research  areas. 
Van  Raan2   described  that  the  scientometric  research  is  devoted  to  quantitative  analysis  of

science and technology. It aims at the advancement  of  knowledge  and  development  of  science  and  technology and also in relation to social and political  questions. Sengupta3  explained the term scientometric  as  the  organisation,  classification,  and  quantitative  evaluation  of  publication  patterns  of  all  macro  and  micro communications along with their authorship by  mathematical and statistical calculations. Basically, the  scientometric analysis focuses on the measurement  of  magnitude  of  the  growth  of  literature  along  with  various  dimensions.

Gupta4, et al. studied the World Cataract Research  publications covered in the Scopus Database  during  the  period  of  2002  to  2011.  Their  study  confirmed  an  exponential  growth  of  publications  from  2025  papers in 2002 to 3080 papers in 2011, witnessing  an annual average growth rate of 4.89 %.The study  analysed  the  authorship  pattern,  citation  impact  of  most productive countries, different types of cataract  research,  subject-wise  break  up,  relatedness  of  various diseases to cataract research, research output  by  different  population  age  groups.  Khan5,  et  al.  conducted  a  bibliometric  study  on  library  and  information  science  literature  in  Bangladesh  from  1966  to  1977.  The  study  found  that  a  total  of  308  articles  were  authored  by  116  professionals  in  32  years  that  is  on  average  9.62  articles  per  years  and  2.6  articles  per  author  in  32  years.    
Ramakrishnan & Ramesh Babu6   analysed    the   literature  output    in    the    field  of    hepatitis  from   three  bibliographic  databases,  namely  MEDLINE,   CINAHL,  and    IPA,    and    found    that  collaboration  in  authorship  pattern  is  prevalent,  averaging  0.85.  Using the pubMed database, falagas7, et al. collected  information  for  the  period  of  1995-2003  in  the  field  of  parasitology.  Research  productivity  was  evaluated  based  on  a  methodology  and  used  in  other bibliometric studies. The research productivity  was  evaluated    in    relation    to    gross    domestic   product    of    each    region    and    in    relation    to   gross national income per capita and population of  each region. Arya8, et al. studied the collaboration  in  research  and  authorship  trend  in  the  area  of  veterinary  sciences  all  over  the  world  with  special  reference  to  India.  The  study  was  based  on  the  data collected from ‘CABI abstracts’ for the period of  2006-2010.  The findings of the study revealed that  the average degree of collaboration was found 0.84  and subject analysis showed a good research in the  area  of  animal  nutrition  and  veterinary  physiology. 
Ravichandran9   analysed  on research publications  in the field of Biodiversity during the period 1975-2010.  It  analysed  1,57,557  articles  of  Scopus  database and  examined  year-wise  distribution  of  articles,  country-wise distribution, languages distribution and  
• bibliographic  form  of  articles,  authorship  pattern,  
country-wise  authorship  pattern,  high  productive  Indian  institutes,  etc.  inferences  and  findings  were  shown  with  relevant  data  analysis.  Dutta  &  Rath10 analysed the global output of ‘Cosmology’ research.  The  study  covered  the  publications  on  the  subject  available in the Web of Science covering the period  of 1999 to 2012.  The various scientometric indicators  have  been  used  in  the  analysis,  with  regard  to  the  literature  growth  trends,  authorship  pattern,  document types involved and active Indian institutions  and   co-coordinating research in this subject area.  Bradford law of scattering was employed to identify  the  core  journals  and  Lotka’s  law  was  employed  to  study  the  authors’  productivity  pattern  are  also  been analysed. Sevukan & Sharma11  study presents  a  detailed  analysis  of  research  performance  of  biotechnology  faculties  in  central  universities  of  India  from  1997  to  2006.  The  study  indicate  that  the growth of literature in biotechnology has steadily  increased  from  15  articles  in  1997  to  43  articles  and two authored publications predominate amongst  the  pattern  of  authorship. 
Garg12   analysed  1223  papers  published  by  India  (347  papers)  and  China  (876  papers)  at  conferences and as journal articles during 1993 and  1997  in  the  field  of  laser  science  and  technology,  and indicated that China's output was twice to that  of  India.  Chinese  scientists  preferred  to  publish  in  domestic journals, while Indian scientists published  in  foreign  journals.  Indian  papers  also  have  more  citations  per  paper  than  China.  Dutt  &  Nikam13 analysed  research  publications  in  the  field  of  solar  cell research in India indexed in Web of Science for  a period of 20 years from 1991 to 2010. The study  found  that  academic  institutions  have  contributed  half  of  the  total  output.  Solar  cell  research  by  Indian  Scientists  is  well  connected  to  international  research  trends  in  the  field.

5.1  Publications output  and  Types 
The  major  source  of  publications  covered  by  engineering index databases on mobile technology is  conference articles with 94,205 (65.16 %) followed  by  journal  articles  with  48,363  publications  (33.45  %).  Conference  proceedings  ranks  the  3rd   position  
5.2 growth  of  Publications 
During  the  period  of  2003  to  2012,  a  total  of  1,44,567  publications  were  published  on  mobile  technology.  The  highest  number  of  publications  is  20,318  articles  in  2011.  The  lowest  publication  is  5,789 in 2003. The average number of publications  published per year was 14456.7. But it is seen from the  Table  2  that  there  is  a  downward  trend  in  2012. 5.3 relative growth rate  and doubling  Time 
The Relative Growth Rate (RGR) is the increase  in number of articles or pages per unit of time. The  mean relative growth rate (R) over the specific period  of  interval  can  be  calculated  from  the  following  equation: 
1-2R   =  Log 
eW2 
  –  Log 
eW1/  T2-T1 where, 
1 - 2R  – Mean relative growth rate over the specific 
      period  of  interval 
LogeW1 –  log  of  initial  number  of  articles LogeW2 –  log  of  final  number  of  articles  after  a 
              specific  period  of  interval 
T2-T1 –  Unit  difference  between  the  initial  time 
          and  the  final  time 
aa-1     –    average  no.  of  articles 
The year is taken here as the unit of time. The

Figure 1. relative growth rate for research output. 
5.4 doubling  Time  (dT) 
There  exists  a  direct  equivalence  between  the  relative  growth  rate  and  the  doubling  time.  If  the  number  of  articles  or  pages  of  a  subject  doubles  during  a  given  period  then  the  difference  between  the logarithms of numbers at the beginning and end  of  this  period  must  be  logarithm  of  the  number  2.  If  natural  logarithm  is  used  this  difference  has  a  value  of  0.693.  Thus  the  corresponding  doubling  time  for  each  specific  period  of  interval  and  for  both  articles  and  pages  can  be  calculated  by  the  formula. 
Doubling  Time  (DT)  =  0.693/R 
Therefore, 
Doubling  time  for  articles
