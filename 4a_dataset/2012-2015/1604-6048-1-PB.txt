ABSTRACT
The present study sought to study the user experience and perception of using different types of electronic
information sources (EIS) by the scientists, pharmacopoeia associates and scientific assistants; to analyse
the different purposes for which the EIS is used by the respondents and to access current user characteristics
associated with use of online resources and databases at the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC). The
study is based on questionnaire method. A questionnaire was distributed among the scientists, pharmacopoeia
associates and scientific assistants to collect desired data. Total 40 questionnaires were distributed to the
selected sample for the current year, 37 valid samples were collected and analysed. The result showed a
growing interest in online journals among the users at IPC. The survey showed that majority of respondents
marked that library possessed useful online journals and databases for the scientific community. The data
scanned and preserved in document management software play an important role to access relevant information.
Awareness among the users about the availability of online journals was found highly satisfactory. Online
journals were mostly used for research needs and similarly pharmacy and pharmacology discipline-based
journals used widely. The EIS is better for accessing current and comprehensive information.
Keywords: Electronic information sources, e-journals, online databases, Indian pharmacopoeia, document

1. INTRODUCTION
Remote access of online journals has been a major
boon to technical and research libraries. Online journals
are considered the note chord of any library’s collection
and have become indispensable for research in any field.
Many online journals are available in the form of
databases as well as being directly accessible through
the internet. The quantity of online journals is growing
larger and has become a quite visible entity in serial
publication1.
With information deluge, everyone needs information
of increasing variety and diversity of level, frequency,
volume, and ease. This complex situation appears to be
ambiguous and heterogeneous as that information need
of particular groups of users and information flow from
specific situations in organisation are difficult to
determine. This situation has given rise to the growth
concept of information searching and the manner to
determine the pattern of searching2.

One of the major developments in library and
information systems in the past two decades is the
advent and spread of electronic information sources (EIS),
services and networks mainly as result of developments
in information and communication technologies. The
commonly available EIS, namely, CD-ROM, online
databases, online public access catalogues (OPAC), and
the internet and other networked information sources are
competing and in some instances replacing the printbased information sources. The EIS provide access to
information that might be restricted to the user because of
geographical location or finances. They also provide
access to current information as these are often updated
frequently3. Access to information is important to
individual scientists, groups of scientists or the academic
community and research institutions for accomplishment
of their programmes and research projects.
Access to e-resources has decreased the time spent
searching for information. Access is only as good as the
resources that can be afforded (e.g., the number of

computers and existence of network systems), the ability
to work with the tools, and the network infrastructure that
supports rapid and convenient connections. The ability to
use e-resources efficiently depends on basic computer
skills, knowledge of what is available and how to use it,
and ability to define a research problem. How scientists
and researchers attain the above skills and knowledge
depends on many factors, such as their disciplines,
academic status and ranks, age, access (hardware and
location) to e-resources, and training. Factors motivating
the use can be, for example, what level of importance they
allocate to e-resources, how useful they have found them,
and for which purposes they use e-resources4.
The library and information centres play a leading role
in scientist-library relationships and in instructional
services such as orientation and training in the use of
library resources. If efficient and effective use is to be
made of library and information centre’s e-resources, then
user training will have to be increased in both intensity
and coverage. It is important to remember that the ability
of library staff to keep up to date is necessary, and,
therefore, training for them is crucial as well5. Effective
use of EIS for retrieving needed information will have a
profound impact especially on the quality of research
output (basically in the publication of Indian
pharmacopoeia (IP), i.e., adding new monographs or in
good laboratory practices, testing of drugs) by the IPC’s
pharmacopoeia scientists and associates.

1.1 Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission
Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission (IPC) is an
autonomous institution of the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare, Govt. of India. The IPC is created to set
standards of drugs in the country. Its basic function is to
update regularly the standards of drugs commonly
required for treatment of diseases prevailing in this region.
It publishes official documents for improving quality of
medicines by way of adding new and updating existing
monographs in the form of IP. It further promotes rational
use of generic medicines by publishing National
Formulary of India.
The IP prescribes standards for identity, purity and
strength of drugs essentially required from health care
perspective of human beings and animals. The IPC also
provides IP Reference Substances (IPRS) which act as a
finger print for identification of an article under test and its
purity as prescribed in IP. The IP standards are
authoritative in nature. The IP is an official document
meant for overall quality control and assurance of
pharmaceutical products marketed in India by way of
contributing on their safety, efficacy, and affordability.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
A large number of earlier studies of users of online
journals have appeared in the last few years. De-Groote6
172

sought the research to determine the impact of online
journals on the use of print journals and inter-library loan
(ILL).The statistics regarding the use of print journals
collected for the period 1995 to 1999 were used for the
study. Also, the request forms of ILL from 1995 to 2000 of
UIC-Peoria students, faculty and staff were studied. The
paper shows that print journals usage decreased
significantly since the introduction of online journals. This
decrease occurred where a journal was available in print.
The ILL request was decreased due to the introduction of
online journals. The decrease in use of print collection
was due to preference of use to access online journals
and the negative impact of online journals was that the
use of journals’ titles was available only in print. It has
also focused that the users may compromise over quality
for convenience when selecting 24 articles from journals.
Monopli7, et. al., in their study of the University of
Patras Greece used an online questionnaire to collect the
data on electronic use which was made available on the ejournals services website. The findings have brought out
that a vast majority of respondents were regular internet
users, 64 per cent users faced the problem of ‘too much
networked information’ when searching the internet, 85.5
per cent used internet daily and 8.4 per cent weekly. Due
to lack of time to search for information, 45 per cent
respondent failed to find required information. The main
users of e-journals service were mostly researchers and
academic staff. The e-resources were used more
frequently by end-users below 35 years of age, it was also
brought out that most of the end-users were men.
Momani8 conducted a research to investigate the use
of internet by the faculty members of applied science and
technology in Jordon to find out how and why they used
the internet and what level of satisfaction they obtained
from it. The findings of the study indicated that the internet
was widely used among faculty members in Jordan and
its use was similar to that in any other developed country.
The most widely used applications were the web for
research and e-mail for communication. The faculty
members in Jordan found no discomfort in their use of the
internet and they perceived it as a very useful tool for
research and communication. Respondents also indicated
that lack of time, access, speed, training, and university
support was the most important barrier for the effective use
of the internet. The study recommended that more training
should be provided for the vast majority of faculty members,
for all schools, ranks, and both the genders.
Siebenberg9, et al., studied to determine if the
selection of e-journals in the Owen Science and
Engineering Library was changing students’ and
researchers’ choice of journals in the paper. The statistics
available from publishers of the journals from 1998 to 2001
were used as method for study in three Science/
technology disciplines at Washington State University.
The results showed that print journals were being used
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(2)

more than e-journals. Generally, e-journals were used
heavily and the availability of electronic format enhanced
the total use of most titles. Some e-journals were used
little or not at all and there were a substantial increase in
the use of some print journals.

improve and encourage users to use maximum of
electronic information resources. The results will help
collection developers in designing suitable policy and
assess the technical intricacies faced by the library staff
in providing effective EIS services. It will also help in
designing the efficient infrastructure requirements for
managing journals in both the formats.

3. OBJECTIVES OF STUDY
The main objectives of the study were to:

4. METHODOLOGY

•

Study the user experience and perception of using of
different types of electronic information sources by
the scientists, pharmacopoeia associates and
scientific assistants;

•

Analyse the different purposes for which the EIS is
used by the respondents;

•

Identify the constraints faced by the respondents
while using the EIS in the Library and Information
centre;

•

Know the impact of usage on the collection of print
journals as well as e-journals; and

•

Assess the satisfaction level of the users with the
access to EIS in the Centre.

The present study was conducted using
questionnaire-based survey along with observations and
informal interviews. The questionnaire was pre-tested on
10 users which included the 3 groups: the scientists,
pharmacopoeia associates, and the scientific assistants
and some amendments were made. A total number of 40
questionnaires were administered among the users of the
Library and Information Centre, IPC under study. Out of
which 37 questionnaires were received back duly-filled in.
The sample respondents chosen for the study consists of
13 scientists, 16 pharmacopoeia associates, and 08
scientific assistants. The data collected were tabulated
and analysed. Statistical techniques of percentage of
respondents have been mainly used to analyse the
collective data.

3.1 Scope of Study

5. SURVEY RESULTS

The present study deals with use of e-resources in IPC of
India. The geographical area is restricted to IPC only. This
can be extended over to the other organisations. Detailed
analysis can be taken to see the impact of technology on
libraries and usage. Further studies could identify which
barriers occur at which stages in the information using
process and how can these obstacles be over come.
There is a vast scope for further research to study different
types of users’ behaviour and comparison of users’
behaviour and attitudes towards the e-resources. Finally
investigator believes that studies are needed on ways to

In IPC, the respondents use a variety of electronic
information sources. To ascertain various demands, the
respondents were asked to state their subject interest in
use of specific types of electronic information sources.
Their responses are depicted in Table 5. Majority of
scientists (100 %) browsed e-journals, online databases
and used CD-ROM databases. In case of pharmacopoeia
associates (100 %), they browsed subject specific
information websites, e-Journals, online databases and
used CD-ROM databases. The scientific assistants
marked 37.50 per cent in browsing of e-journals, online
databases, research project sites, and CD-ROM
databases (Table 5).

The respondents were asked to give reasons as to
why they use EIS but based on choices fixed by the
scientists and pharmacopoeia associates. Various
professional purposes for which electronic information
sources was used were elicited from the respondents.
Table 4 indicates the purpose of using the electronic
information sources. It is noted that there is significant
use of electronic information sources mainly for research
purposes (100 %), and it is quite natural that the
respondents have given top priority for this purpose (Table 4).

Table 6 provides the use of journal from different
discipline, 100 % respondents use pharma-based
journals. Table 6 also shows the other most used and
useful online journals.
Table 7 reveals that the population of scientists and
pharmacopoeia associates (100 %) preferred online
version of journals. Whereas, 30.77 per cent of scientists
and 37.50 per cent of pharmacopoeia associates
preferred print version. Whereas, the overall responses of
scientific assistants were 12.50 per cent (Table 7).

Users perceive EIS to hold many advantages. Some
of the main benefits of using electronic information
resources are listed in Table 10. From the analysis it is
evident that a large majority and also equal percentage
(100 %) of the respondents got better informed and get
current and comprehensive information by using EIS
(Table 10).
Respondents in this study were asked about the
satisfaction with current state of EIS access in their
Library and Information Centre, which is a very important
variable to investigate user behaviour. All the respondents
(100 %) were highly satisfied to access EIS (Table 11).

6. FINDINGS
•

On the whole, respondents’ self-perceived ability to
use the computer for EIS is quite high.

•

There is significant use of EIS mainly for research
purposes (100 %), and it is quite natural that the
respondents have given top priority for this purpose.

•

Effective use of EIS for retrieving needed information
will have a profound impact on the quality of research
output (basically in the publication of IP, i.e., adding
new monographs or in good laboratory practices,
testing of drugs) by the IPC scientists and
pharmacopoeia associates.

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(2)

•

Awareness among the users about the availability of
online journals was found satisfactory (100 %). All the
respondents (100 %) use pharma-based journals.

•

The findings confirm that a large percentage (100 %)
of users in an IPC prefer online version.

•

All (100 %) of the respondents felt to be better
informed and get current and comprehensive
information by using EIS.

7. SUGGESTIONS
There is no doubt that the internet has assumed the
role of providing a medium of scientific information and
today’s users can no longer depend only on conventional
information resources to cope with the latest
developments in their respective fields. The internet can
provide access to essentially unlimited resources of
information in the field of pharmacy and pharmacology as
in other disciplines. Although the Library and Information
Centre at IPC is well equipped with the information
communication technology, but the following suggestions
should be followed for further improvement:

quality of work performed by them is affected significantly
by the operation of the information system. Scientific and
technical information has itself been recognised as a
resource. In view of its role and importance as a resource,
the issues relating to scientific and technical information
are now finding a place of priority in the scientific and
technological plans and programmes of several nations.
Various scientific and technical libraries, documentation,
and information centres are being upgraded, improved,
and integrated to enhance their importance and role in the
transfer of information. In this regard IPC has upgraded
and improved their Library and Information Centre at
satisfaction level. The IPC provides adequate budget
every year for the upgradation of library. It allocates 47
lakh for the subscription of journals per annum.

(ii) The EIS as well as conventional resources at library
should be fully utilised.

Findings of this study confirm that EIS are now
ubiquitous for members of the scientific community. As
Library and Information Centre provides more online
resources, librarians should take steps to make sure
users are aware of these resources and teach users their
importance in filling information needs. The online
information environment is not static; rather, frequent
changes in content, search engines, and access points
make for a constantly moving target. Changing use
patterns will require librarians to examine collection
development policies, instructional programmes, and
reference services to meet information needs in the online
environment.

(iii) Library needs to introduce more extensive information
and reference services.

8. CONCLUSIONS
The information resources are very important for the
functioning of the government as well as national welfare.
These resources need to be harnessed and utilised
properly. The survival of an organisation largely depends
upon the utility of its services in relation to the community
it serves. It is, therefore, necessary to take into account
the present state of affairs of the working of these
libraries. The clientele of the government library is very
complex so also are their information needs. Services
based on management principles need to be renewed
frequently keeping in view the changing requirements of
the users particularly in the Government of India libraries.
Scientific and technical problems have now
themselves reached a level which requires abundant,
relevant, and timely use of information. Information plays
an all-important role in scientific and technical activities.
