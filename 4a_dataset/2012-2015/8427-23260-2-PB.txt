ABSTRACT 
This paper focuses on the study of e-resources in the libraries of institutes of management in India.  The  main  objective  is  to  determine  the  availability  of  different  types  of  e-resources,  viz.,  subscribed  e-resources through consortium, memberships of library networks and collaboration with libraries. Based  upon  the  fndings,  some  suggestions  for  strengthening  the  services  pertaining  to  e-resources  have  been given. A resource sharing model has been proposed which promises the maximum availability of  e-resources and also increases their reach and access.  
Keywords: Electronic  resources,  Indian  Institute  of  Management,  library  network,  consortium,  library 
  portals, education networks 
1. 
INTRODUCTION 
The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) libraries,  with  their  wide  range  of  collection  of  electronic  resources, fill an essential requisite in the intellectual  pursuits  for  the  users.  IIM  are  public  autonomous  institutes  of  management  education  in  India.  They  are  considered  to  be  prestigious  business  schools  of  India.  Libraries  of  IIMs  are  located  at  Calcutta,  Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kozhikode, Lucknow, Indore,  Shilong, Rohtak, Ranchi, Raipur, Tiruchirapalli, Udaipur,  and  Kashipur.  These  institutions  are  recognised  as  premier  management  institutions,  comparable  to  the  best  in  the  world  for  teaching,  research  and  interaction  with  industries.  All  the  IIMs  are  registered  societies  governed  by  their  respective  Board  of  Governors.  
The e-resources are playing the most important  role in the area of education to provide better services  and  easy  access.  Due  to  explosion  of  information  and  knowledge,  the  e-resources  have  become  more  powerful  tools  that  allow  users  to  search  the  information more effectively and efficiently. Libraries  use  ICT  for  better  services  and  satisfying  diverse  user  needs.  They  have  transformed  into  digital  and  virtual  libraries  where  books,  journals,  and  magazines  have  changed  into  e-books,  e-journals,  and  e-resources.  
Libraries need ICT infrastructure for e-resource  management,  i.e.,  computers,  LCD  projectors,  CD  net  servers,  CD-Rom  towers,  back-up  devices,  UPS,  multimedia  kit,  internet  connection,  servers,  ERM,  software,  etc.  Libraries  should  use  publicity  methods for e-resources through e-mail, telephone,  notice on the library website, poster, orientation day,  social  network  media,  etc.  Barriers  in  procurement  of  e-resources  are  maintaining  backup  files  of  the  e-resources,  frustrating  interfaces,  requirement  of  technical  expert  staff  to  maintain  e-resources,  etc.  E-resources  can  be  accessed  only  within  the  campus  of  the  institution  and  user  must  be  aware  of  e-resources  and  should  also  be  able  to  access  that  format  properly7.  
Challenges  in  managing  of  e-resources  are  keeping track of varying access conditions, changing  licensing  terms  and  conditions,  subscription  and  renewal  dates,  authentication,  resource  sharing  limitations,  usage  data  collection,  etc.

were satisfied with the e-resources available at the  NASSDOC library. Vashishth, C.P.2  highlighted some  constrains  of  e-resources  in  learning  process.  The  problems  like  adverse  effects  of  computer  screens  on  human  eye,  disposal  of  e-infrastructure,  etc.,  have  been  discussed.  The  impact  of  e-resources  on  learning  and  scholarship  is  discussed  in  detail.  A  study  conducted  by  Madhusudhan3 found  that  e-resources  have  become  an  integral  part  of  the  information needs of research scholars at Kurukshetra  University  and  they  can  be  good  substitutes  for  conventional resources, if the access is fast. Zhanng  Liyi4  examined the relationships among the factors of  users’ educational level, disciplines and purpose in  using e-resources. The results showed that there was  an increasing demand for literature written in English  in the disciplines of natural science, medicine, and  engineering.  Sakshi  &  Singh5   conducted  a  survey  to find out the use of e-resources by chemists and  physicists  at  Punjab  University,  Chandigarh.  The  study  revealed  that  all  the  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  were  familiar  with  e-resources.  Hussain6  examined the use of e-information resources  and  services  among  the  teachers  and  students  of  Sir  Chhotu  Ram  Institute  of  Engineering  and  Technology, Meerut, India. He found that majority of  teachers and students were aware of e-information  resources  and  services.  Baikady7 et  al.,  examined  the implementation of off campus access to licensed  e-resources of library using EZ Proxy remote login.  They concluded that the remote login facility brought  about convenience in use and access for the users.  Mendhe,  &  Dhandore8   conducted  a  study  to  find  out  the  awareness  of  e-resources  in  the  scientific  community  of  agriculture  engineering  and  their  ease  of  use.  They  observed  that  the  availability  of  e-resource  on  the  campus  is  almost  sufficient  for  all  the  existing  disciplines  but  the  infrastructure  to  use these resources is not adequate and can hinder  the  ability  to  meet  the  requirements  of  users.

OBJECTIVES 
• 
• • 
• 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
Find out information about e-resources available  in  the  libraries  of  IIMs 
Available  e-resources 
Know the available online databases, memberships  of  these  libraries 
Know the members of library networks and their  collaboration  with  libraries 
4. 
METhODOLO gy 
The  study  is  restricted  to  surfing  the  website  of  the  13  IIM  library  e-resources.  The  list  of  the  
218 
websites  and  portals  that  have  been  the  primary  source of information for IIMs libraries is given Table  1. The websites of the institutes have been the main  source  of  data  collected  for  analysis  the  internet  for tracing the IIM’ library e-resources. Sources for  data  collection  are  tracing  data  of  search  engines  and  collecton  from  URLs. 
6.  DATA ANAL ySIS 
6.1  Libraries  of  IIMs 
Table  1  provides  the  basic  information  of  the  IIM libraries in India, 3 libraries were established in  2010, 3 libraries were established in 2011. 2 libraries  were established in 1962. The date of establishment  of  parent  organisation  is  assumed  to  be  the  date  of  establishment  of  its  library,  wherever  separate  date  of  establishment  of  library  is  not  given.  
6.2 Available  Electronic  Resources 
From Table 2, it is observed that all the libraries  (100 %) e-journals, databases, and CDs/DVDs with  books  libraries  have  76.92  %  e-books.  8  libraries   have  (61.53  %)  JSTOR. AV  material  was  available  in  53.84  %  and  e-newspapers  (38.46  %).  Also  (30.76  %)  libraries  have  e-dissertation  have  and  (15.38 %) have e-theses and e-magazines its their  portal  (Fig.1). 
Figure 1.  E-resources (%) available. 
During observations of the IIM libraries portals, it  is found that most of the e-resources are accessible  through  IP  addresses,  while  some  require  log-in  ID  and  password.  In  two  IIM  libraries,  e-resource  accessible mode is restricted to internal users only,  i.e., in IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Indore. Rest of the  institutes are providing access through IP address,  log-in  ID  and  password  and  within  campus.  IIM  Kozhikode and IIM Udaipur libraries have membership  of NASSCOM. Some IIM libraries like IIM Ahmedabad,  Kozhikode,  Indore,  Shilong,  Tiruchirapalli,  Udaipur  and Bangalore provide specialised tools like EBSCO  Discovery, institutional repository and remote login.  Some  IIM  libraries  formed  a  consortium  in  2000.  Currently,  resources  available  through  IIM  library  consortium are Informaworld, Sage (HSS collection),  Wiley,  Springer  links  and  Wiley-Blackwell  (HSS  collection).

PROPOSED  RESOURCE  ShARINg   MODEL  FOR  IIM  LIBRARIES 
The  detailed  study  shows  that  none  of  these  libraries can be called as self-sufficient or complete in  itself. Since these libraries share common goals and  also  since  the  demands  of  users  in  these  libraries  are  also  mostly  similar,  their  library  services  and  reach  to  users  can  be  maximised  by  implementing  the  resource  sharing  model  as  proposed  in  the  Fig.  2. 
In the proposed model, all the common e-resources  of libraries of IIM will be provided through consortia  thereby  minimising  the  redundant  costs.  These  consortia  will  be  accessed  through  high  speed  internet  VPN  supporting  bandwidths  from  1  GBPS  to  10  GBPS.  The  unique  e-resources  of  each  library  like  e-books  purchased  by  them,  e-thesis,  institutional  repositories,  AV  material,  etc.  will  be  shared by all the participating libraries through library  networks like INFLIBNET, DELNET and also through  information  networks  like  SIRNET,  NICNET,  etc.  The  user  community  which  comprises  of  students,  research  scholars  and  faculty  should  be  provided  with  single  window  search  tools  made  available  
Figure 2. Proposed resource sharing model for IIM  
libraries. 
on  library  portals.  The  librarians  and  information  professionals  will  provide  list  and  hyperlinks  of  all  the  e-resources  accessible  through  consortia,  various  library  networks  and  their  own  institutional  repositories  on  their  library  portals.  The  users  will  be  empowered  with  remote  login  facility  also.  The  alerts,  e-mails,  SMSs,  etc.  regarding  new  arrivals  will  be  sent  to  the  users  which  they  can  view  on  their mobile phones/laptops. This model will ensure  that all users get access to all types of e-resources  anytime,  anyhow  and  anywhere.

8. SUggESTIONS 
Based  on  the  study  following  are  some  of  the  suggestion  for  improving  the  library  further: 
• Libraries should provide virtual tours for e-resources  
collection. 
• Libraries should provide online training to users  
and  staff  on  how  to  access  e-resources,  how  
4. 
on  websites. 
Each library should maintain e-resource webpage  on  library  portals.  
Collaborative  research  needs  to  be  boosted  in  the  use  of  IIMs’  libraries. 
Remote  access  to  all  the  e-resources  should  be  provided  by  the  IIMs’  libraries. 
Users  should  be  informed  about  the  new  e-resources  added  to  the  library  collection. 
to  get  printouts,  how  to  maintain  e-resources

CONCLUSIONS 
In the present study, some IIM libraries are not  maintaining separate library portals. They have given  information about e-resources on institute webpage,  e.g.,  IIM  Lucknow,  and  IIM  Ranchi. 
Also,  some  libraries  have  not  given  list  of  e-journals,  databases  and  consortium  e-resources.  Library  e-resources  may  be  maintained  on  intranet  so  that  all  the  departments  could  access  the  e-resources. 
E-resources are available in different types and  the study found that only e-journals, databases and  CDs/DVDs with books were accessible in all studied  libraries.  Librarian  can  create  more  awareness  on  e-resources among the users so that they can make  better  use  of  the  resources.  The  libraries  of  IIMs  should  come  on  a  common  platform  so  that  they  could share common as well as unique e-resources  held in each library through high performance library  and information networks and the same should also  be  accessible  via  remote  login.
