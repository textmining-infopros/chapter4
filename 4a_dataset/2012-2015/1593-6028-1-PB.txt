ABSTRACT
As computer usage continues to grow exponentially, the desire of users to use electronic publications
(e-publications) has also increased tremendously. This has led to the publication of materials in electronic form
as e-publications on both CD-ROMs and web. The electronic book (e-book) is one of the several forms of
e-publications and its popularity has been growing steadily for the past decade. This bibliography provides
all references of the published literature on e-books and related technologies in one source so that it will save
time for others in conducting literature searches and reviewing the developments. The information included
in this bibliography is collected systematically from all the published sources in the world such as journal
articles, conference papers, conference proceedings, books, reports and PhD theses on e-books until the
last quarter of 2011. Mainly, it covers e-books, e-books publishing, the impact of e-books on different types
of users, e-book publishing techniques and trends, e-book user interfaces and other technologies related to
e-publications. This bibliography will be useful to all researchers conducting research in any areas related
to e-books and e-book publishing.
Keywords: Electronic books, e-books, bibliographies
