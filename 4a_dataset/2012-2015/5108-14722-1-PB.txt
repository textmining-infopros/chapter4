1. INtrODUctION  
Journals are an important medium of communication  for researchers. They bring the latest knowledge to  the notice of researchers. Several journals are being  published in India in science and technology as well  as social sciences. DESIDOC  Journal  of  Library  &  Information Technology  ( DJLIT) formerly (DESIDOC  Bulletin of Library and Information Technology Journal)  is  an  important  journal  in  the  field  of  library  and  information  science  (LIS)  and  is  being  published  since  1981.  It  is  a  peer-reviewed,  bimonthly,  open  access journal that brings to the notice of readers the  recent developments in information technology (IT),  as applicable to library and information science. It is  meant for librarians, documentation and information  professionals,  researchers,  students  and  others  interested  in  the  field.  The  Journal  covers  original  research  and  review  articles  related  to  IT  which  is  applied  to  library  activities,  services  and  products.  The  Journal  is  indexed  by  Scopus,  LISA,  LISTA,  EBSCO  Abstracts/Full-text,  Library  Literature  and  Information  Science  Index/Full-text,  The  Informed  Librarian Online, DOAJ, Open J-Gate, Indian Science  Abstracts,  Indian  Citation  Index,  Full  text  Sources  Online,  World  Cat,  Proquest,  and  OCLC.

3.1 Data  and  Methodology 
The  source  journal  is  an  open  access  journal  and is available on the DRDO website publications. drdo.gov.in/ojs/index.php/djlit. The data for the study  was downloaded from the said website for 12 years  from  volume  21  (2001)  to  volume  32  (2012).  The  data consists of year of publication with its volume  number,  name  of  the  author  with  their  affiliations  and its geographical location, total count of authors,  length  of  the  articles  in  terms  of  the  number  of  pages,  number  of  references  cited  by  the  article.  Editorial  published  in  the  journal  has  not  been  included in the analysis. The data was downloaded  on MS Excel sheets. Data was analysed to meet the  objectives  mentioned  above.  For  studying  several  parameters mentioned under the objectives the data  has  been  divided  into  two  periods  i.e.  2001-2006  and  2007-2012.  Complete  count  method  has  been  followed  for  the  analysis  of  the  data.

Figure 1 shows the pattern of growth of articles  over  the  period  of  study.  It  indicates  that  with  a  small  number  of  articles  in  2001,  the  number  of  articles  grew  continuously  and  reached  a  peak  in  2012  with  65  articles  with  a  slight  decline  in  2010.  It  is  worth  mentioning  here  that  a  strict  peer  review system is followed to maintain the quality of  the  journal  which  leads  to  high  rejection  rate  and  hence  all  the  articles  submitted  to  a  journal  can’t  be  accepted  for  the  publication.  
4.  ANALYsIs 
4.1  Article  Distribution  Pattern  According  to  
Years  
Table  1  presents  the  data  on  the  number  of  papers  published  during  2001-2012.  It  indicates  that 391 articles were published in 69 issues during  2001-2012.  Thus,  on  average  32.6  articles  were  published  per  year.  In  first  six  years  (2001-2006)  the number of articles published was less than the  average  and  in  the  second  block  (2007-2012)  the  number of articles published were more than average.  Highest  number  (65)  articles  were  published  in  volume 32 (2012). Further analysis of data indicates  that  only  89  articles  were  published  during  2001- 2006,  while  in  the  last  six  years  (2007-2012)  the  journal  has  published  302  articles.  The  number  of  articles published during 2001-2006 is less because  during  that  period,  the  journal  had  the  policy  to  cover several other sections like IT events, IT scan  and  literature  survey,  etc.  Later  in  2007  a  policy  decision was taken that only scholarly articles were  to  be  published  and  thus,  the  number  of  articles  increased significantly. Thus the number of articles  has increased more than three times in the second  block as compared to the first block. This indicates  the increasing importance of the journal among the  LIS  professional  community.

4.2  Pattern  of  Authorship  
Table  2  presents  the  data  on  the  pattern  of  authorship in DJLIT  during 2001-2012. Data indicates  that  the  proportion  of  single  authored  and  two  authored papers is almost the same. Author examined  how  the  pattern  of  authorship  has  changed  over  a  period  of  time.  For  this  the  data  has  been  divided  into two blocks, i.e., 2001-2006 and 2007 -2012 and  application of Co-Authorship Index (CAI) suggested  by Garg & Padhi6  has been made. CAI indicates the  
413 

========2========

DJLIT,  VOL.  33,  NO.  5, SEPTEMBER   2013 
type of co-authorship that dominates the authorship  pattern  and  is  obtained  by  calculating  proportional  output of single, two and multi-authored papers for  different  blocks. 
Here      CAI  =  {(nij/nio)/(noj/noo)}x100  where 
nij   =  Number  of  papers  having  j-authors 
       in block i, 
nio   =  Total  output  of  block  i, 
noj   =  Number  of  papers  having  j-authors  
              for  all  blocks, 
noo   =  Total  output  for  all  blocks  included 
                in  the  study,  and 
j   =  1,  2,  and  >3  
CAI = 100 implies that in a block co-authorship  effort for a particular type of authorship corresponds  to  the  average  of  all  blocks,  CAI  >  100  reflects  higher  than  average  co-authorship  effort,  and  CAI  <  100  lower  than  average  co-authorship  effort  in  that  block  for  a  given  type  of  authorship  pattern.  From  the  values  of  CAI  for  single  authored  papers  for two blocks, it can be inferred that the proportion  of  single  authored  papers  has  increased  in  the  later  block  (2007-2012)  as  compared  to  the  first  block.  However,  the  proportion  of  two-authored  and  multi-authored  papers  has  decreased  during  the  later  block.

4.3  Geographical  Distribution  of contributions 
Articles  published  in  the  journal  are  originated  from India and abroad. However, major portion (88 %)  of the articles originated from India and about 10 %  from abroad. About 2 % articles have been written in  international collaboration. These papers were written  in  collaboration  with  Singapore  (4),  and  China  and  Thailand  one  paper  each.  Articles  published  from  abroad  were  from  21  different  countries.  Among  these  highest  numbers  of  articles  was  from  USA,  UK  and  Singapore  with  eight  contributions  from  each.  Other  countries  that  have  contributed  to  the  journal  are  Taiwan–3  articles,  Greece,  Nigeria  and  Kenya–2  each.  Argentina,  Australia,  Bangladesh,  Belgium,  Canada,  China,  Egypt,  Germany,  Japan,  South Africa,  Spain,  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand  and  UAE  –1  article  each.  Further  analysis  of  data  on  Indian

4.5.1  Special  Issues 
The journal has kept pace with time and published  special  issues  quite  frequently.  The  special  issue  also covers 3-4 general papers also. Table 6 gives  the  details  of  the  subjects  on  which  special  issues  were  published  along  with  their  volume  and  issue  numbers.  
Further  analysis  of  data  indicates  that  during  2001-2006 only three special issues were published    and  no  special  issues  have  been  published  during  2004  to  2006.  Emphasis  was  given  on  general  papers  as  well  as  other  sections  were  included  in  the  journal.  During  second  block  20  special  issues  were brought out. It can be seen from Table 5 that  from  2007  special  emphasis  has  been  given  on  publishing  special  issues  to  give  the  readers  an  in

During  2007  and  2008  four  special  issues  each  were  published.  It  can  be  noticed  that  current  topics  of  readers’  interest  such  as  semantic  web,  ontology,  e-books,  library  consortia,  and  many  such  special  issues  have  been  brought  out.  Also  three  special  issues  were  published  on  Intellectual  Property  Rights  which  shows  their  usefulness  in  library  and  documentation  scenario.  
4.6  Length  of Articles 
An  analysis  of  data  on  page  length  published  in  the  journal  reveals  that  during  the  period  under  study, majority of articles 252 (65 %) have the page

specific  subjects.  During  the  second  block  papers  with  page  lengths  1-5  and  6-12  have  increased  significantly,  while  those  of  11-15  and  more  than  15  have  decreased  considerably. 
4.7  type  of  Documents  cited  and  their  
referencing  Pattern  
An  analysis  of  data  was  made  to  identify  the  type of documents that were cited by the scholars.  The  data  for  the  same  is  presented  in  Table  7.  It  indicates that journals are the most preferred source  of cited documents followed by web-resources and  books.  Conference  proceedings  ranked  fourth  in  choice of cited documents. Further analysis of data  indicates that citation of journals has increased from  38%  in  first  block  to  46%  in  second  block.  The  citation  for  books  has  declined  in  second  block  as  compared  to  first  block.  However,  the  citation  for  web-resources  remained  almost  constant. 
year-wise references were analysed to understand  how  the  number  of  references  has  changed  during  the  period  of  study.  Table  8  shows  data  on  the  number of references per paper. It indicates that the  number of references per paper is inconsistent and varied  between  10  and  18.  It  was  highest  (18)  in  2011. The average number of references per paper  was 13.8. Out of 12 years, for 6 years the number  of  references  per  paper  was  greater  than  average  i.e.,  13.8  and  for  rest  of  the  years  was  less  than  average. A  review  paper  by  Dr  Nageswara  Rao  in  Vol. 28 had 119 references which was highest among  all the papers published in DJLIT . Also  out  of  391  articles, 159 articles had a reference range as 1-10  and  137  articles  containing  11-20  references.

The popularity in the adaptation of bibliometric  techniques in various disciplines stimulated stupendous  growth  of  literature  on  bibliometrics  and  its  related  areas. DJLIT  has published 391 articles during 2001- 2012.  The  maximum  number  of  articles  (65)  was  published in 2012. There has been significant growth  in  the  number  of  articles  published  from  2001  to  2012. The study reveals that the maximum number  of  contributors  243  (61  %)  are  joint  authored  (two  or  more  authors). As  the  journal  is  published  from  India and as is expected highest (88 %) contributions  are from India and only 12 % contributions are from  abroad.  Dr  BM  Gupta  has  published  maximum  no.  of  articles  (26)  in  the  journal  and  has  been  the  Guest  Editor  (along  with  Dr  Gangan  Prathap)  of  a  special  issue  on  Scientometrics  and  has  proposed  to bring out another special issue on Scientometric  Research.  The  maximum  number  of  contributions  (64  %)  has  the  length  of  6-10  pages  which  is  standard practice for the journal for research articles.  Referencing  pattern  of  the  journal  reveals  that  majority  of  the  authors  preferred  journals  as  the  source  of  citation.
