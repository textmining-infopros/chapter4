1.  INtRODUctION 
Research  is  a  structured  enquiry  that  utilises  acceptable scientific methodology to solve problems  and create new knowledge. It is an investigation of  finding  solutions  to  scientific  and  social  problems  through objective and systematic analysis. Slesinger  & Stephenson1  in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences  define research as the manipulation of things, concepts  or symbols for the purpose of generalising to extend,  correct or verify knowledge, whether that knowledge  aids  in  construction  of  theory  or  in  the  practice  of  an  art.  It  is  a  process  of  collecting,  analysing  and  interpreting  information  to  answer  questions.  The  growth  in  information  communication  technologies  (ICTs) in general and electronic information resources  in  particular,  have  given  impetus  to  research  and  related  activities  throughout  the  world. 
Advancement in knowledge takes place through  research publications in the form of journal articles,  conference  papers,  and  communications  among  others. The  research  activities  of  an  institution  are  reflected through its publications. Analysis of these  publications  helps  in  providing  a  picture  of  the  research  productivity  of  that  particular  institution.  There have been many bibliometric and scientometric  studies to assess the research productivity of various  disciplines as well as institutions. Jeevan & Gupta2 provided  a  scientometric  profile  of  research  output  from  Indian  Institute  of  Technology,  Kharagpur.  
Kumbar3,  et  al.,  analysed  the  growth  and  impact  of  research  output  of  University  of  Mysore  during  1996-2006.  Mukherjee4   made  an  analysis  of  the  scholarly  literature  from  selected  universities  of  Delhi  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  Kaur  &  Mahajan5   made  a comparative evaluation of research output of two  pioneer institutions in medical sciences – AIIMS, New  Delhi and PGIMER, Chandigarh. Kumbar and Gupta6 analysed  the  contribution  of  Karnataka  University  in  science  and  technology  during  2001-10.  Satish  Kumar7   did  a  quantitative  analysis  of  research  productivity  of  Maharshi  Dayanand  University  in  Chemistry  during  2001-10.  Baskaran8   studied  the  research  growth  trend  and  author  collaboration  of  Alagappa  University  during  1999-2011. 
1.1  Maharshi  Dayanand  University,  Rohtak 
Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak is  accredited  with  'A'  Grade  by  National  Assessment  and  Accreditation  Council  (NAAC).  The  University  came  into  existence  by  an  Act  No.  25  of  1975  of  the  Haryana  Legislative  Assembly  in  1976  with  the  objective  to  promote  inter-disciplinary  higher  education  and  research  in  the  fields  of  environmental,  ecological  and  life  sciences.  It  was  rechristened  as  Maharshi  Dayanand  University  in  1977 after the name of a great visionary and social  reformer,  Maharshi  Dayanand.    It  had  a  unitary  and  residential  character  in  its  nascent  stage,

3.  MEtHODOLOGY 
The  study  is  based  on  the  publications  data  retrieved from Scopus database for the period 2000- 2013.  The  string  which  was  used  to  retrieve  the  relevant data on research productivity of MDU was:  (AF-ID (‘Maharshi Dayanand University’ 60004880))  AND PUByEAR >1999 AND PUByEAR <2014). Only  the journal articles, reviews and articles in press were  considered for the study. The results obtained were  refined  to  obtain  relevant  data  regarding  authors,  institutions, source journals, etc. For calculating the  international collaborative papers the affiliation field  of each article was manually checked. For citations  data,  the  citations  received  by  the  article  since  its  publication  were  considered.

SIwACH  &  KUMAR: BIBLIOMETRIC ANALySIS OF RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS OF MAHARSHI DAyANAND UNIVERSITy  (ROHTAK) 
Chemistry  followed  by  Indian  Journal  of  Chemistry  Section B: Organic and Medicinal Chemistry,Medicinal  Chemistry  Research  and Thermochimica Acta. The  authors  of  MDU  have  been  consistently  publishing  articles in the Indian Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry  from  2000  to  2010  after  which  the  number  of  publications  in  this  journal  declined.  In  the  journal  Medicinal Chemistry Research, out of the 29 articles  published  by  authors  of  MDU,  the  maximum  (20)  were  published  in  just  one  single  year  2012. 
Table 4 also shows the JCR impact factor (IF),  SJR  and  SNIP  values  of  the  top  18  journals  for  the  year  2013.  
Journal  citation  reports  offers  a  systematic,  objective  means  to  critically  evaluate  the  world's  leading journals, with quantifiable, statistical information  based  on  citation  data9.  The  impact  factor  of  a  journal is calculated by dividing the number of current  year citations to the source items published in that  journal  during  the  previous  two  years10.  SCImago  journal  rank  (SJR)  is  a  prestige  metric  based  on  the  idea  that  'all  citations  are  not  created  equal'.  with  SJR,  the  subject  field,  quality  and  reputation  of  the  journal  have  a  direct  effect  on  the  value  of  a citations based on the total number of citations in  a  subject  field11.  The  impact  of  a  single  citation  is  given higher value in subject areas where citations  are  less  likely,  and  vice  versa.  It  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  a  journal's  citation  count  per  paper  and  the  citation  potential  in  its  subject  field12.  As  
a  field-normalised  metric  SNIP  offers  researchers,  authors,  and  librarians  the  ability  to  benchmark  and  compare  journals  from  different  subject  areas.  This  is  especially  helpful  to  researchers  publishing  in  multidisciplinary  fields. 
Among these 18 journals the top 5 with highest IF  are  Sensors and Actuators B-Chemical,  International  Journal  of  Biological  Macromolecules,Analytical  Biochemistry,Arabian  Journal  of  Chemistry  and  Thermochimica Acta.  The  top  5  journals  according  to  SJR  are  Sensors  and  Actuators  B-Chemical,   Analytical Biochemistry,International Journal of Biological  Macromolecules,  Thermochimica  Acta  and  Journal  of  Molecular  Liquids.  According  to  SNIP  values  the  top  5  journals  are  Sensors  and  Actuators  B  Chemical, Thermochimica Acta, International Journal  of Biological Macromolecules, International Journal  of  Pharmacy  and  Pharmaceutical  Sciences  and   Journal  of  Molecular  Liquids.  Thus,  it  is  observed  that  the  IF,  SJR  and  SNIP  are  the  highest  for  the  journal  ‘Sensors  and Actuators  B-Chemical.‘ 4.5  Highly  Prolific Authors 
The  authors  having  25  or  more  publications  during  2000-2013  are  shown  in  Table  5  along  with  their  number  of  papers,  ACPP  and  h-index.  The  research  activity  seems  to  be  highly  skewed  as  the  top  16  authors  account  for  half  (49.48  %)  of  the  total  publications  of  MDU.  The  average  productivity  of  these  16  authors  was  38.  7  authors

This study has explored the publishing behaviour  of  scholars  of  Maharshi  Dayanand  University.  The  fourteen  year  (2000-13)  study  examined  the  total  number  of  1247  papers  in  the  manifestation  of  journal  articles  and  reviews  along  with  articles  in  press.  The  study  indicates  that  the  highest  numbers  of  papers  (219)  were  published  in  the  year  2013  and  lowest  (30)  in  2001.  A  steep  rise  in  the  research  publications  of  MDU  was  observed  during the last four years. The increasing research  productivity  of  the  University  can  be  attributed,  to  some  extent,  to  the  increase  in  major  and  minor  research  projects  being  undertaken  by  the  faculty  members  during  the  last  few  years.  The  average  citation per paper (ACPP) of MDU papers was 5.58  and  this  was  lodged  highest  (13.20)  in  2001.  Guru  Jambeshwar University, Hisar was main collaborator  with  66  papers  followed  by  Kurukshetra  University,  Kurukshetra  (45  papers).  Among  the  international  collaborations, two institutes of South Korea were in  lead-Korea Institute of Energy Research (39 papers)  
35 35 35 
and  yonsei  University  (17  papers).  Chemistry  has  been the front runner as research subject of which  the  largest  numbers  of  articles  were  published  in  Indian Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry. Among the  productive  authors,  C.S.  Pundir  of  the  Department  of  Biochemistry  comes  at  front  with  the  highest  number  of  publications.  P.K.  Jaiwal  of  Department  of  Biotechnology  was  having  largest  citations  per  paper  in  terms  of  its  average  number.  The  paper  by joint authors S. Verma and S.N. Mishra had the  highest  number  of  citations  which  cumulated  into  99  in  number.  Out  of  1247  papers,  only  11  papers  carried 50 or above citations. Uniform citation pattern  was  not  observed  in  the  results  of  the  study.
