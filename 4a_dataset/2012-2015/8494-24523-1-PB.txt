The  Directory  of  Open Access  Books  (DOAB)  is  a  discovery  service  for  open  access  e-books.  It  provides  a  searchable  index  to  peer-reviewed  e-books  published  under  an  open  access  business  model, with links to the full text of the publications at the Open Access Publishing in European Networks  (OAPEN)  Library,  publisher’s  website  or  repositories. The  present  study  aims  to  assess  the  current  trends of the open access e-books in the feld of science and technology available through DOAB. The  data was collected online regarding the science and technology e-books in March 2014 for analysis. The  results reveal that 307 e-books are available on science and technology through DOAB falling in three  categories–monographs (209, 68.08 %), book series (93, 30.29 %) and conference proceedings (5,1.63 %).  These e-books deal with eight  major subject areas of Science and Technology having 36 sub-felds. The  maximum number of e-books is available on General Science (95), Technology & Engineering (54), Earth  & Environmental Sciences (50) & Health & Medical Sciences (47). In sub-felds most of the e-books cover  Computer Sciences (24), Information Theory (24), General Medicine (20), Mathematics (17), Biology (13)  & Geography (11). The authorship trends show that the maximum contribution is by single author (51.14  %) followed by two authors (74, 24.10 %) and three authors (36, 11.73 %). The linguistic assessment  shows  that  57.98  %  (178)  of  these  e-books  have  been  published  in  English  followed  in  German  (88,  28.66%) and Italian (18, 5.86 %) respectively. The publishing trends reveal that 59.93 % (184) e-books  have contributed by university presses whereas 40.07 % (123) by other publishing houses around the  world. The maximum number of e-books (245, 79.80 %) is available through the Creative Commons (CC)  license, whereas 20.20 % (62) e-books are available through comparable institutional licenses.

1.  inTrODuCTiOn 
The  origin  of  e-books  can  be  traced  back  to  the  Project  Gutenberg  started  by  Michael  Hart  in  1971.  The  Project  Gutenberg  is  considered  as  the  first  collection  of  e-books  followed  by  many  other  projects like the Internet Archive, HathiTrust, Google  Books  and  many  others.  However,  the  phrase  ‘electronic  book’  is  believed  to  have  been  coined  by  Andries  Van  Dam  in  1980  and  the  first  widely  available  e-books  was  Random  House’s  Electronic  Thesaurus in 19811. The earlier e-books were digital  versions  of  print  books.  Among  the  first  internet- only publishers of new e-books were Boson Books,  Hard  Shell  Word  Factory  and  Online  Originals,  all  founded  in  the  mid-1990s2.  The  Hard  Shell  Word  Factory has set the first professional standards for  commercial  e-books  and  pioneered  author-friendly  contracts.  Online  Originals  was  the  first  e-books  publisher  to  win  mainstream  book  reviews  in  The  
New  York  Times  and  a  nomination  for  a  major  literary  prize,  the  Booker  Prize3.  
Gradually,  e-books  gained  more  importance  in  the  plans  of  publishers  and  subscriptions  of  libraries.  The  launching  of  the  NetLibrary,  Questia  and  ebrary  in  1999,  2000  and  2001  respectively  made thousands of e-books commercially available  to libraries and their users4. E-books were dependent  on technology especially computer for their use and  were  lacking  portability  feature  like  printed  books.  With  the  release  of  the  Kindle  (an  e-books  reader)  by Amazon in 2007 and the iPad by Apple in 2010,  there  was  a  revolution  in  the  use  and  delivery  of  e-books.  Kindle  was  designed  to  access  the  Amazon website, allowing users to browse, buy and  download  e-books  with  this  e-book  reader  without  the  need  for  a  separate  computer5.  The  iPad  of  Apple  was  a  similar  device  used  to  buy  and  read  e-books  online  from  Apple’s  iBookstore.Presently,  due to the technological developments, most of the

LOAN AND NISA: OPEN ACCESS E-BOOKS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
e-books readers are used to buy, browse, view and  download  not  only  e-books  but  other  documents  as  well. 
1.1  Pros  and  Cons  of  E-books 
An e-book, short form of electronic book, is the  electronic counterpart of a printed book, which can  be  viewed  on  a  desktop  computer  or  a  portable  device  such  as  a  laptop,  or  e-book  reader  or  application. Simply, a book that is in a digital format  and that is read on a computer or an e-book reader  or  application  is  called  an  e-book.    Reitz6   defined  e-book  as  a  ‘digital  version  of  a  traditional  print  book  designed  to  be  read  on  a  personal  computer  or  an  e-books  reader’.  In  principle  an  e-books  is  quite  similar  to  a  print  book:  only  the  medium  is  different. For a traditional print book the medium is  paper  and  an  e-books  is  the  digital  representation  of the printed material (print book), the medium can  vary  from  a  (laptop)  computer  to  digital  e-books  reader,  mobile  phone  or  even  (through  a  desktop  printer)  traditional  paper.  Usually,  the  content  is  available  in  pdf.  or  html  format,  but  plain  text  or  XML  formats  are  also  available.  This  makes  the  content  much  more  versatile  and  flexible  than  the  traditional  print  book7. 
E-books offer a number of advantages over their  print  for  all  stakeholders,  i.e.,  patrons,  libraries,  authors  and  publishers.  For  patrons,  e-books  offer  24/7 availability, remote access (accessible outside  the  physical  walls  of  a  library),  full-text  searching,  changeable  font  size,  accurate  presentation  and  possession  for  an  unlimited  time.  For  libraries,  e-books  require  no  circulation,  no  shelf  space  or  re-shelving  and  are  never  lost,  damaged,  stolen,  or  overdue8.  Further,  e-books  are  easily  indexed,  catalogued  and  included  in  online  public  access  catalogue  (OPAC).  Readers  can  also  find  e-books  through  search  engines  (such  as  Google),  library  OPAC  or  the  publisher  platform  which  make  them  more  exposed  and  visible  to  a  larger  audience7.  E-books  are  also  more  beneficial  for  authors  as  compared  to  print  counterparts. Authors  get  higher  royalty  from  e-books  publishers  in  comparison  to  conventional  publishers.  In  addition,  authors  get  more  citations  which  simultaneously  increase  their  h-index.  
For  publishers,  e-books  never  go  out  of  print,  and subsequent editions are easily created, modified  and  distributed  without  any  time  delay  and  extra  labour.  However,  there  are  many  limitations  of  e-books as well. Walters9   argues  that  preservation  of  e-books  is  very  difficult  because  it  requires  long-term maintenance of several distinct elements:  texts, file formats, software, operating systems, and  hardware. Technological dependence, technological  obsolescence,  copyright  concerns,  security  issues  
and  plagiarism  problems  are  other  challenges  that  need  to  be  addressed  thoroughly. 
1.2  Open Access  E-books 
Open  access  is  a  new  publishing  model  which  allows  its  contents  to  be  used  by  all  free  of  cost.  Contents are always freely available anytime (24/7)  anywhere  to  anyone.  This  model  has  made  very  difficult  for  commercial  and  business  enterprises  to  retain  monopoly  on  knowledge  resources  and  keep them behind financial walls. It has opened the  new doors, gates and ways to access the scholarly  information. Open access means ‘free of cost open  for all’. The Budapest Open Access Initiative (2002)  describes  open  access  as  ‘the  literature,  freely  available on the public Internet, permitting any users  to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or  link to the full-texts of these articles, crawl them for  indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them  for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal,  or  technical  barriers  other  than  those  inseparable  from gaining access to the Internet itself10. According  to  Loan4,  ‘An  open  access  e-books  is  a  book  in  electronic  or  digital  form  that  is  available  on  the  public  internet  free  of  charge,  which  can  be  read  on  a  computer,  laptop,  or  e-books  reader.’  Thus  any  e-book  which  is  available  on  public  internet,  permitting  any  user  to  read,  download,  copy,  print,  use,  distribute  and  share  for  teaching,  learning,  research or other non-commercial purposes is called  open access e-books. These e-books are available in  different online knowledge banks like digital archives,  digital libraries, digital repositories, databases, and  directories. These e-books offer creative possibilities  for  expanding  access  to  information  and  bridging  the  knowledge  gap  between  information  rich  and  information  poor  nations.  
1.3  Directory  of  Open Access  Books 
The  Directory  of  Open  Access  Books  (DOAB)  was officially launched on July 1, 2013 at the Open  Access  Monographs  in  the  Humanities  and  Social  Sciences Conference at the British Library in London11.  However,  unofficially  it  was  operating  since  2011  and  its  beta  version  was  launched  in  2012.  The  DOAB is a service of the Open Access Publishing in  European Networks (OAPEN) Foundation. The OAPEN  Foundation  is  an  international  initiative  dedicated  to  open  access  monograph  publishing,  based  at  the  National  Library,  The  Hague12.  DOAB  is  being  developed in close cooperation with Lars Bjørnshauge  and Salam Baker Shanawa (Director of SemperTool),  who  were  also  responsible  for  the  development  of  the  Directory  of  Open  Access  Journals  (DOAJ)13.  SemperTool  develops  and  maintains  the  DOAB  system. Which is a software development company  specialising  in  building  digital  library  technologies,

• Full-text  of  these  e-books  is  available  on  
the  search  results  by  restricting  the  search  to  a  particular  publisher,  license,  language  and  period.  Information  seekers  have  the  browsing  facility  on  its  homepage  as  well  and  can  browse  the  e-books  through  title,  subject  and  publisher  approaches.  In  addition,  DOAB  provides  abstracting  service  to  its  e-books collection. Abstracts of e-books are readily  available  online  for  readers  in  order  to  judge  their  relevance.  Readers  can  easily  download  required  e-books from the qualitative collection of these open  access  e-books  available  through  DOAB.  
1.3.3  Licenses  and  Use 
The  DOAB  only  lists  books  that  are  licensed  under  the  Creative  Commons  (CC)  or  comparable  licenses. These open access e-books are available  under  the  banner  of  “free  to  read  and  free  to  share”. Readers not only have rights to read, print,  download and save only but also the right to share  for  non-commercial  purposes.  
The  e-books  with  CC  license  listed  in  DOAB   are downloaded almost twice (181 %) as compared  to e-books with a more restrictive license available  in the OAPEN Library in a period of one year from  
June  2013-May  201416.  This  is  the  reason  that  the  OAPEN  Library  or  publisher’s  website  or

5.  DiSCuSSiOnS 
The  DOAB  provides  access  to  three  types  of  e-books  in  Science  and  Technology–monographs,  books series and conference proceedings. Monographs  are available in more number than book series and  conference proceedings. These e-books cover almost  all the major subject areas of Science and Technology  like  Agriculture  and  Food  Sciences;  Biology  and  Life  Sciences;  Earth  and  Environmental  Sciences;  General  Science;  Health  and  Medical  Sciences;  Mathematics and Statistics; Physics and Astronomy;  and Technology and Engineering and their sub fields  including Computer Sciences, Chemical Technology,  Environmental Technology, Information Theory, General  Medicine,  Internal  Medicine,  Neurology,  Surgery,  Public  Health,  Dentistry,  Physiology,  Psychiatry,  Pharmacy,  Biology,  Zoology,  Botany,  Agriculture,  Forestry, Animal Science, Aquaculture and Fisheries,  Nutrition and Food Sciences, Earth Science, Geology,  Geography,  Ecology,  Civil  Engineering,  Electrical  Engineering,  Nuclear  Engineering,  Construction,  Manufacturers,  Mathematics,  Physics,  Astronomy,  etc.  It  reveals  that  the  open  access  e-books  are  available  on  almost  all  branches  of  Science  and  Technology  through  DOAB.  There  is  a  need  to  aware  the  academic,  scientific  and  technological  communities  about  these  e-books  in  workshops,  orientation  courses,  refresher  courses  and  training  programmes  for  their  optimum  utilisation.  Library  and  information  managers  have  to  play  a  leading  role  in  this  direction.  
The maximum numberof S&T  e-books have been  contributed  by  authors  with  almost  50:50  by  single  and joint authors whereas a small number by editors  
308 
as well. The S&T e-books are published in different  languages,  mostly  in  English  followed  by  German  and Italian respectively. DOAB is already providing  the  abstracting  services  of  its  e-books  collection.  The  availability  of  the  abstracts  of  these  e-books  in English and other prominent languages can also  prove very helpful to library managers and users in  order to judge their relevance. These e-books have  largely  contributed  by  the  university  presses  and   publishing  houses  of  the  world.  The  Amsterdam  University Press, Australian University Press (ANU),  Cambridge University Press, Manchester University  Press, Oxford University Press, Palgrave Macmillan,  Springer,  OpenEdition  Press,  etc.  are  among  the  many note worthy participating publishers. Further,  only  those  e-books  are  included  in  DOAB  which  are  peer  reviewed  by  independent  and  external  experts  before  publication.  Hence,  the  quality  of  these  e-books  can’t  be  challenged  at  any  cost. 
The  majority  of  these  e-books  have  been  published in the last ten years which is an indication  that  these  e-books  contain  the  nascent  thought,  not  obsolete  information.  The  pagination  analysis  shows  that  these  e-books  are  of  various  sizes,  however,  the  majority  is  of  medium  size  having  upto  400  pages.  This  shows  that  these  e-books  aren’t  simply  pamphlets  but  well  authored  and  documented  e-books.  These  e-books  are  available  through    CC  and  comparable  institutional  licenses.  These licenses are very important to increase usage  of  these  e-books  as  they  are  available  under  the  banner  of  ‘free  to  read  and  free  to  share’  for  all  non-commercial  purposes.  
6.  COnCluSiOnS 
The  open  access  movement  is  growing  fast  in  all  directions  overcoming  the  regional  barriers  and  surpassing the disciplinary boundaries. Like journals,  e-books also have been started to flourish in all fields  of  knowledge.  The  present  study  is  witness  to  the  steady growth of open access e-books in S&T. The  emerging e-books revolution offers many opportunities  for  institutions  to  enhance  teaching,  learning  and  research processes alongwith enriching the collection  of their libraries without any budgetary concerns. In  preparation for these opportunities, copyright rules,  preservation problems, safety concerns, technological  issues, cultural challenges, plagiarism and other such  matters need to be addressed thoroughly alongwith  the  developmental  stages  so  that  institutions  can  successfully expand their adoption and use of e-books.  international organisations, national bodies, academic  institutions/associations/societies, funding agencies,  policy  planners,  authors/researchers/readers  and  other  open  access  advocates  need  to  join  hands  in  this  regard  and  to  make  the  e-books  revolution  a  real  success.
