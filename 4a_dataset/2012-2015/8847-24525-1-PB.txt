This paper presents the survey of libraries located in and around Chennai comprising of academic  (government  and  private  universities),  public  and  special. The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  present  the  state-of-the-art of the libraries and the specifc objectives are to survey and compare the major academic,  public and special libraries in and around Chennai with regard to the collection, manpower, resources (print  and e-resources), and information and comminication technology (ICT)-based services, etc; to identify the  issues and challenges being faced by the librarians  and to offer suggestions and recommendations for  the improvement of the libraries. A total of 32 libraries comprising of 9 government universities, 13 private  universities, 3 public and 7 special have been considered for this survey. The data has been collected  during  January  and  mid-February  2015  based  on  a  structured  questionnaire. There  exists  variation  in  the infrastructure, print and e-resources and services (traditional and ICT-based) offered in the libraries  of those institutions. Based on the results of the survey, a few suggestions and recommendations are  
offered.

1.    InTroduCTIon 
Education  and  libraries  have  been  inseparable  since the dawn of civilization and their co-existence  has  been  attributed  to  many  landmarks  in  the  knowledge creation and dissemination. In the history  of India, it is observed that Nalanda, Takshasila and  Vikramasila  universities  and  the  gurukula   type  of  institutions highly depended on libraries which were  earlier known by ‘grantha bhandar ’ or ‘Granthasala’.  Libraries like some other social institutions have passed  through periods of recognition, lull, encouragement  and  neglect  followed  by  slow  growth,  decay  and  then crisis. However, the library scene in the post- independence  India  was  by  all  standards  a  golden  period.  More  and  more  libraries  were  established  triggering chain of new developments1.  The  library  in  an  educational  institution  is  now  considered  as  actively  participating  intermediary  between  the  learners  and  the  vast  amount  of  sources.  It  can  be  stated  that,  mutuality  between  education  and  
Received 22 May 2015, online published 28 July 2015 
the  libraries  have  been  perpetuating  since  people  have become information literate and perceived the  sense  of  learning.  Indian  library  and  information  sector  can  be  divided  into  five  major  areas  as,  (a)  national library sector; (b) academic library sector; (c)  special and scientific library sector, (d) government  library  sector;  (e)  public  library  sector.  Due  to  various  reasons  the  scientific  and  special  library  sector  is  much  more  developed  and  modernised  than  the  other  four  sectors2.  There  are  academic  institutions imparting education from under graduation  to  postgraduation  and  doctoral  level  programmes  both  in  general,  professional  and  technical  fields  under  government,  private,  and  government-aided  institutions.  Accordingly,  there  exists  variation  in  the infrastructure, resources and services offered in  the  libraries  of  those  institutions.  The  libraries  are  changing in response to changes in the learning and  research environment and also dynamic changes in  the  information  use  behaviour  of  users.

2.    LITerATure revIew 
A large number of studies have been conducted  in  the  survey  of  libraries  in  different  parts  of  the  globe and more particularly in India. Since the present  survey  is  concerned  with  the  study  of  libraries  in  and  around  Chennai,  literature  survey  was  done  of  libraries  in  Tamil  Nadu.  While  Ashok  Kumar  &  Ramesh Babu3   has  surveyed  the  public  libraries  in  Tamil Nadu with respect to district central libraries,  Nageswara  Rao  &  Ramesh  Babu4   and  Nageswara  Rao5   conducted  a  survey  on  autonomous  college  libraries,  their  services,  facilities  and  networking  aspects. Vinayagamoorty, et al. 
6 
 and Ramesh Babu  & Subramaniyan7  surveyed engineering educational  institutional  libraries  in  Chennai.  All  these  studies  focused  on  the  state-of-the-art  of  libraries  in  Tamil  Nadu and recommended for the complete automation,  provision  of  e-services,  manpower  development  and  networking. 
3.    objeCTIves  
The  objectives  of  the  study  are: 
• Survey  and  compare  the  major    academic,  
• 
Offer suggestions and recommendations for the  improvement  of  the  libraries 
4.    MeT hodoLogy 
The  study  uses  survey  approach  for  which  a  questionnaire was designed (Appendix-A). The data  was  collected  during  January  and  mid-February  2015.  Although  there  are  number  of  libraries  in  and  around  Chennai,  for  the  purpose  of  the  study,  only  32  prominent  libraries  have  been  selected    to  examine  the  current  status  and  identify  the  issues  and challenges, with special emphasis on information  technology,  being  faced  by  the  libraries.  The  data   has  been  analysed  using  SPSS.  The  state-of-the- art of the libraries surveyed in and around Chennai  has  been  presented  in  Appendix-B.

RAMESH  BABu, et  al .:  LIBRARIES  IN  CHENNAI  ON  THE  THRESHOLD  OF  THE  THIRD  MILLENNIUM 
especially, Engineering and Medical fields. Prior to  independence,  there  was  only  1  university  library  (university  of  Madras)  and  2  public  and  special  libraries  each. 
5.3  Provision  of  Physical  Facilities 
It  is  observed  from  Table  1  that  12  libraries  are  housed  10,000  sq.ft  space  or  less,  8  libraries  an  area  between  10001  and  25000  sq.ft.  However  7  libraries  function  in  more  than  50,000  sq.ft  area,  out  of  which  are  2  are  public  libraries. 
5.4  Provision  of  Manpower 
The provision of professionally trained manpower  is  not  satisfactory  as  reflected  in  Table  1.  It  is  to  note  that  the  public    libraries  are  in  a  better  position  since  all  the  three  libraries  surveyed  have  more  than  20  trained  staff,  when  compared  to  the  other  libraries.  
5.5  Quantum  of  Collection  (Print) 
The quantum of print collection is satisfactory as  many of the libraries (Table 2) have built a feasible  
collection depending on the life span of the libraries.  The three government university libraries, two public  and private university libraries have more than one  lakh books each. Nine private universities, one each  public  and  special  libraries  subscribes  more  than  100  national  journals.  Similarly,  3  government  and  5  private  university  libraries  subscribe  more  than  100  international  journals.  However,  the  non-print  collection is far from satisfactory which is essential  in  the  present  e-environment.  
5.6  Quantum  of e-resources 
A majority of the libraries (20) don’t have weeding  out  policy  to  withdraw  the  unwanted  collection  (Table  3).  
5.7  Technical  Processing 
While Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) has  been used in 16 libraries, Colon Classification (CC)  is  used  in  five  libraries,  and  universal  Decimal  Classification (uDC) in 4 libraries. It is interesting to  note that, one each public and special library do not  use any scheme of classification. Similarly 20 libraries

5.9 digitisation  Initiatives 
In  this  age  of  digitisation,  when  libraries  are  transforming  themselves  as  digital  libraries,  27  libraries  under  the  study  are  in  the  initial  stages  of  digitisation  (Table  6).  
5.8  Library Automation  software  used 
Eleven  different  library  automation  software  packages are in use among the libraries surveyed.  Among them, AuTOLIB (7) and SOuL in 4 libraries  are  used  and  rest  of  the  libraries  follow  the  other  packages.  However,  one  each  public  and  special  library  don’t  use  any  software  package  (Table  5).

Total 25 variables have been identified as issues  
6. and  challenges  being  faced  by  the  libraries  in  the  
7. present  context.  Five  point  scaling  technique  have  been  adopted  to  elicit  the  respondents  opinions  as  ‘Strongly  Agree’,  ‘Agree’,  ‘Neither  Agree  Nor  Disagree’,  ‘Disagree’  and  ‘Strongly  Disagree’  and  the results are shown in Table 9. It is observed that  there exists variation among the libraries belonging  
s.  
to  the  different  types  of  libraries  in  this  regard. 
While ‘Budget Issues/Financial Constraints’ has  been ranked ‘first’ (weighted arithmatic mean (WAM)=  4.11)  by  the  libraries  belonging  to  government  universities, on the other hand the same has been  ranked as ‘second’ by the private university libraries.  However ‘Collection Development Policy’ has been  ranked first. While ‘Security’ is the major challenge  for the public libraries as ranked ‘first’ (WAM=4.67),  on  the  other  hand  the  ‘user  training/orientation  to  use  e-resources’;  Weeding  policy;  Resource  sharing  and  consortia  (WAM=4.86)  are  the  major  challenges  which  were  ranked  as  ‘first’  by  the  special  libraries.  
Further  ‘Storage  Problems’  has  been  ranked  ‘Second’ by the Government university Libraries, on  the other hand ‘Budget Issues/Financial Constraints’  ranked as second by the private university libraries.  For  Private  university  Libraries,  ‘Preservation’  ‘Interoperability  Issues’  ‘Collection  development  policy’  and  ‘Lack  support  from  the  administration’  are  the  issues  ranked  as  Second  (WAM=4.33),  on

the other hand ‘Collection Evaluation’ (WAM=4.71)  is  the  ‘second’  rank  by  the  Special  Libraries.  It  is  significant  to  note  that,  security  has  been  ranked  as  first  for  public  libraries,  on  the  other  hand  the  same  ranked  as  3  by  private  universities  and  special  libraries,  but  ranked  with  9th   position  by  the  government  university  libraries.

Based on the findings of the study, the following  recommendations  are  suggested:

The ICT has a positive impact on all the library  and  information  services  like  reference  service,  current  awareness  service,  online  public  access  catalogue, etc. Libraries and information centres are  undergoing  metamorphosis  and  are  reengineering  their services, reskilling their staff and reorganising  their  work  space  in  consonance  with  changing  information  systems,  better  and  more  effective  information  communication  channels,  and  users’  preferences  for  accessing  information8.

Further,  it  is  suggested  that  the  existing  staff  should  be  trained  in  the  application of ICT in libraries through continuing  professional education (CPE) programmes. The  existing  training  programmes  for  librarians  need  to  be  further  improved  with  regard  to  the  computerisation  programmes.

The academic libraries play an important role in  the academic community by providing necessary forum  and  resources  for  faculty  and  students  to  do  their  research and advance their knowledge.

Considering the significant developments towards  the  establishment  of  digital  libraries  as  one  of  the  features  of  the  global  information  society  and  its  importance  in  the  information  storage,  retrieval  and  dissemination,  it  is  suggested  that  academic  libraries  shall  march  towards  building up digital infrastructure and necessary  digital  initiatives  to  go  in  for  creating  digital  libraries.

The  future  library  will  be  a  hybrid library which must be user-centerd and expert- assisted.  Librarians need to establish partnerships,  coalitions, and connections, technological, personal  and  organisational,  to  ensure  a  central  role  in  the  third  millennium.
