Web of Science  is a major citation database which provides access to the world’s leading scholarly  literature. University of Kerala is one of the premier higher education institutes which cater the educational  needs of the Kerala. The present study evaluates the research productivity of University of Kerala based  on the data collected from Web of Science  over a period of thirteen years from 2000 to 2012. This study  attempts to analyse the overall performance of the faculty members of Science Departments of University  of Kerala in research productivity. The parameters such as  form-wise, year-wise, subject-wise classifcation  of published papers, most productive authors and the most preferred journals, etc. are considered for the  study. The impact factor and the citation received were also analysed. The study reveals that Chemistry is  the subject which produces more number of papers while the multi-authorship also possesses a lead role  in this subject. Indian journals are the most preferred journals to publish the articles which are followed by  UK. Collaborative Coeffcient varies from subject to subject. The result shows that the research productivity  of the University of Kerala is much recognised at international level.

1. IntrodUctIon 
Higher  education  is  the  major  source  which  contributes  input  to  technological  capability  and  change, besides higher rates of growth. The function  of  a  university  is  not  merely  to  impart  skills  and  techniques required for running industries, business  and government and non government departments,  but  to  impart  to  the  young  minds  certain  ethics  and  values  that  become  the  bed  rocks  of  social  life  at  large.  Universities  should  uphold  the  best  values  and  practices  in  the  society  and  act  as  the  beacon  light  so  that  the  nation  does  not  drift  aimlessly  on  the  shores  of  uncertainty,  chaos  and  disorder.  In  the  words  of  Smt.  Indira  Gandhi,  former  Prime  Minister  of  India  “Education  is  a  liberating force, cutting across the barriers of caste  and  class,  smoothing  out  inequalities  imposed  by  birth  and  other  circumstances”.  In  educational  institutions knowledge is present in individual faculty,  researchers,  administrators  and  decision-makers  which  is  shared  to  the  community  in  the  form  of  published  sources  such  as  books,  journals,  course  materials,  curriculum  and  research  reports,  etc.   Knowledge  rich  organisations  generate  value  from  their  intellectual  and  knowledge-based  assets.

University  of  Travancore  ,  which  later  became  the  University  of  Kerala,  was  established  in  1937  by a promulgation of the Maharajah of Travancore,  Sri  Chithira  Thirunal  Balarama  Varma  who  was  also  the  first  Chancellor  and  Sir  C.P.  Ramaswamy  Ayyar, the then Diwan (Prime minister) of the State  was  the  first  Vice-Chancellor  of  the  University.  It  was  the  sixteenth  university  to  set  up  in  India  and  10  colleges  within  the  state  of  Travancore  which  were affiliated to the Madras University became the  affiliated  colleges  of  the  University  of  Travancore.   Presently,  the  university  has  16  faculties  and  42  departments  of  teaching  and  research  in  addition  to  study  centers.  There  are  236  affiliated  colleges  functioning  under  the  University  of  Kerala.

retrieval of scientific literature1.  By  using  a  citation  index,  one  determines  what  subsequent  papers  have  cited  a  particular  source  document  which  is  the  major  advantage  of  citation  indexes  over  conventional subject indexes and using SCI  a user  can  find  high-impact  articles  from  peer-reviewed,  influential journals, uncover relevant results in related  fields, discover emerging trends that help to pursue  successful  research  and  grant  acquisition,  identify  potential collaborators with significant citation records  and  integrate  searching,  writing,  and  bibliography  creation  into  one  streamlined  process. 
The bibliographic details of the published literature  were collected using general search option of Web of  Science. In the address field of the general search  option, the name of the university as ‘University of  Kerala’  was  provided.  The  search  was  limited  for  a  period  of  thirteen  years,  i.e.,  2000  to  2012  and  1068  records  were  received.  Even  though  all  the  publications  emanating  from  University  of  Kerala  were not covered in WoS,  the  study  is  confined  to  WoS  only. Another limitation is that the publications  of science departments alone were considered and  the  period  was  limited  to  13  years.

Ponomariov  &  Boardman8   analysed  the  effect  of  university  research  centers  on  the  productivity  and  collaboration  patterns  of  university  faculty  and  measured  the  productivity  and  collaboration  patterns  of  university  researchers  affiliated  with  a  relatively  large-scale  and  ‘mature’  university  research  center  to  discern  the  effects,  if  any,  of  the  center  mechanism  on  individual  scientists  and  engineers.  Sudhier9   carried  out  a  study  based  journals  cited  by  the  physicists  at  University  of  Kerala  to  examine  the  applicability  of  Bradford’s  law  of  scattering  on  a  sample  of  303  journals  containing 2655 citations collected from 12 doctoral  theses  during  the  period  2004-08.  Wang10,  et  al .  analysed the scientific performance of National Taiwan  University and Peking University by two indicators,  namely citations per publication and h-index, based  on  the  data  extracted  from  the WoS   from  2000  to  2009.  Jeyshankar11, et  al.   analysed  bibliographical  details  of  1282  research  articles  published  by  the  scientists  of  CECRI  during  the  period  2000-2009  and  found  that  2009  was  the  most  productive  and  collaborative  research  was  dominant.  Further,  the  study investigated authorship pattern, co-authorship  pattern, highly prolific authors and highly preferred  journals  by  the  scientists  of  CECRI.    
Kumbar12   portray  the  growth,  contribution  and  impact  of  research  carried  out  by  the  scientists  of  University of Mysore in science and technology and  point out the patterns of communications of university  scientists  and  studies  the  extent  of  concentration  and  scattering  of  their  research  output  in  different  journals.

6.1 form-wise classification 
The categorisation of different forms of contribution  shows  that  94  %,  i.e.,  1012  documents  are  in  the  form  of  articles  which  forms  the  majority  of  the  contribution.  Proceedings  and  meeting  abstract  comes  in  second  and  third  position  with  28  and  19 contributions each. It is found that there are 14  reviews  during  2000  and  2012.  Editorial  material,  Letter, Correction and Bibliographical items also has  been  contributed  during  the  period  of  study. 6.2 year-wise distribution  of  Papers 
In  total  1068  articles  got  included  in  WoS database  during  2000  to  2012  from  University  of  Kerala.  Table  1  provides  year-wise  distribution  of  articles.  It  is  seen  that  36  articles  published  in  the  year 2000 from University of Kerala, which increased  gradually. During 2011, more number of articles was  included  in  WoS   i.e.,  126  (11.79  %),  but  in  2012

it  has  decreased  to  117  (10.9  %)  articles.  On  an  average,  there  were  82  articles  per  year.    
Figure  1  provides  the  pictorial  representation  of  the  year-wise  distribution  of  articles.  It  is  clear  that  at  the  beginning  stage,  the  number  of  articles  published under the category ‘University of Kerala’  was less and increased progressively. But it can be  seen  that  in  between  the  ups,  there  is  drop  downs  also  in  the  number  of  articles.    
6.3  Subject-wise distribution  of  Papers 
The subject-wise categorisation of the published  articles from University of Kerala shows that Biology  has more number of articles, i.e., 274 (15.83 %) and  possesses  the  first  position  while  Chemistry  owns  the  second  position  with  257  (14.85  %)  articles.   
The category Engineering, Physics, and Geology  has 231 (13.34 %), 107 (6.18 %), and 78 (4.51 %)  articles respectively. Science and Technology in general  and  the  subject  Mathematics  has  74  (4.27  %)  and  47 (2.72 %) articles which is the category which has  least number of contribution. From Table 2 it can be  inferred that lab-oriented subjects has more number  of  publications  which  has  international  coverage.

of  articles,  i.e.,  114  while  the  author  who  possess  second  position  contributed  only  57  articles,  i.e.,  5.337  %. The  author  with  10th   rank  contributed  28  articles during the study period, i.e., 2.622 %. From  the table it is apparent that Dr T.S. Anirudhan from  Department of Chemistry holds the first position with  114  articles,  while  V.P.M.  Pillai  of  Department  of  Opto-electronics and Dr O.V. Oommen of Department  of  Zoology  possess  second  and  third  position  with  57  and  53  articles  respectively.    
While  observing  it  is  clear  that  these  top  10  authors  are  from  lab-oriented  departments  which  indicate  the  elevated  position  in  publishing  their  research. In Table 4 Local Citation Score (LCS) and  Global  Citation  Score  (GCS),  a  score  of  citations  derived from WoS is provided. LCS is the citations  received  from  the  local  collection  and  GCS  is  the  citation  frequency  based  on  the  full  WoS  count  at  the time of data download. It is clear from the table  that Dr T.S. Anirudhan from Department of Chemistry  received  271  citations  with  1908  global  citations.  Dr V.K.Vaidyan received only 16 LCS but his GCS is 259.   6.6  Publishing  country  of  journals  where

Among these 873 (81.7 %) of journals were published  in journals originated from India and the rest 17.3 %  appeared in journal originated from foreign countries  scattered  in  different  parts  of  the  globe  (Table  5).  Around  873  articles,  i.e.,  81.74  %  of  articles  are  published in Indian journals which have international  coverage. UK and USA shares the second and third  rank  with  37  (3.46  %)  and  34  (3.18  %)  articles  respectively.  The  journals  which  less  number  of  articles appeared were categorised as other countries  which  are  45  articles  in  number  and  received  23  LCS  and  596  GCS.  It  can  be  said  that  only  18  %  of  the  literature  are  published  in  foreign  journals  and the rest of the journals are Indian origin which  has international reputation. Journals originated from  India  received  1011  LCS  and  8857  GCS  which  is  the  highest  citation  while  journals  originated  from  Peoples  Republic  of  China  received  0  LCS  but  62  GCS.  Thus  it  is  evident  from  the  Table  5  that  by  and  large  University  of  Kerala  scientists  prefer  to  publish  in  Indian  journals.

papers while in Physics, Geology and Chemistry the  single-authored papers are 1, 2, and 4 respectively.   
Altogether there are only 34 single-authored papers  while multi-authored papers are 1034, which indicates the  dominance of multi-authorship. In Biology, there are 267  multi-authored papers, which is followed by Chemistry  with 253 papers and Engineering with 225 papers. In  Mathematics  the  multi-authorship  is  less,  i.e.,  40.   6.8 collaborative coefficient 
Ajiferuke  &  Tague17   introduced  collaborative  coefficient  (CC),  for  which  the  single  author  gets  one  full  credit  while  multi  authored  papers  will  get  half  credit  each,  i.e.,  if  ‘j’  is  the  number  of  authors  then each author received 1/j credit and the values  obtained  will  be  between  0  and  1.  By  this  index,  it  is possible to differentiate various levels of multiple  authorships  and  the  increase  in  single-authored  articles  the  value  of  this  index  decreases  and  will  tend  towards  zero.  Ajiferuke  &  Tague17   explained  that  the  degree  of  collaboration  in  a  discipline  is  not  accurate  when  the  proportion  of  multiple  authorship  or  mean  number  of  authors  per  paper  calculated. Instead of these, they proposed a measure  combining  some  of  the  merits  of  both  measures.  The  CC  can  be  explained  as  a  single-authored  paper  gets  one  credit;  two-authored  paper,  each  received  half  credit  and  in  general  if  there  are  ‘n’  number of authors, each receives 1⁄n  credits and the

average credit awarded to each author of a random  paper  is  E[1⁄n],  a  value  which  lies  between  0  and  1.  It  vanishes  for  a  collection  of  single-authored  papers, and distinguishes between single-authored,  two-authored,  etc.,  papers  (Savanur  &  Srikanth18).   The  mathematical  formula  to  calculate  CC  is  as  follows: 
∑ 
A 
 
1jfj 
j1= 
   
CC = 1 - 
N 
where, fj  is the number of authors papers published  in  a  discipline  during  a  certain  period  of  time;  N  is  the total number of papers published in a discipline  during a certain period of time; and j is the greatest  number  of  authors  per  paper  in  a  discipline.  
Here the value of CC varies from discipline to discipline  and the lowest CC is in Mathematics, i.e., 0.22 and  highest CC is in Chemistry, i.e., 0.37 which is followed  by Geology with CC 0.36. In Biology, CC is calculated  as  0.33  while  in  Engineering  the  CC  is  0.34.    
In  Physics  and  S&T  general  CC  is  obtained  as  0.34  and  0.27  respectively.  Therefore  it  can  be  summarised  that  in  Chemistry,  Geology,  Physics,  and Biology multi-authorship are more while in other  subjects  such  as  Mathematics  and  S&T  in  general  collaboration is less. According to Ajiferuke17   if  the  value  of  CC  tends  to  zero,  single-authored  papers

The present study tried to provide a comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  data  obtained  from  WoS.  It  is  found  that  at  the  early  stage  the  coverage  of  publications from University of Kerala was less but  it is increasing gradually even though there are ups  and  drop  downs  in  a  few  years  and  2011  is  the  year which possess more number of articles. More  articles are published from journals from India, USA  and  Netherlands.  The  CC  varies  from  discipline  to  discipline  and  in  Chemistry  the  CC  is  high  and  in  Mathematics  the  CC  is  less.  Authorship  pattern  analysis reveals that multi-authorship dominates in  university system as two-authored, multi-authored and  mega-authored  papers  are  more  in  all  disciplines.  The  IF  of  the  top  productive  journals  ranges  from  0.1  to  2.25  and  among  the  country  of  origin  of  the  top preferred journals, India possess 1st  place which  is followed by Netherlands, USA and UK. Form-wise  distribution  shows  that  article  contribution  is  more  when  compared  to  other  forms  of  publication.  The  investigation of productivity of authors discloses that  the  most  productive  author  belongs  to  Department  of  Chemistry  which  is  followed  by  Department  of  Opto-electronics.

The  team  research  of  the  faculty  and  students  of universities in turn provides joint authorship which

results in high collaboration. This study is limited to  the data included in Web of Science   which  means  the  journal  articles  which  is  not  covered  in  this  database  does  not  comes  under  the  purview  of  this  study.  But  the  study  reveals  that  the  research  productivity  of  the  University  of  Kerala  is  much  recognised at international level. The policymakers  of  the  university  should  develop  more  effective  approaches  to  augment  research  capacities  and  to  persuade  research  performance  to  accelerate  scientific productivity of faculties. By offering research  facilities and financial supports, they could resolve the  annual minimum research prospects of the affiliated  academic  staff  of  each  faculty.  Moreover,  the  task  of  research  activities  should  be  more  emphasised  in a way that academic staff considers research as  a  major  part  of  their  professional  workflow.
