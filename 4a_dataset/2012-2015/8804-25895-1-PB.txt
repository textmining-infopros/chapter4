Search engine is a computer program that searches documents on the internet containing terms being  searched by a user. This study discusses the search engines, an effective tool for library professionals. The  study determines the various aspects of search engine including background of search engines, and how  search engines work. Further, it analyses the internet search techniques, i.e., basic, advanced and refne  search. The paper highlights the effective use in searching information on internet on the basis of Boolean  operators AND, OR, NOT and proximity searching, etc. Finally, it highlights the categories of search engines.

1.  INTrODUcTION  
The  world  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  is  undergoing  rapid  changes  in  the  history  of  civilization.  With  the  big  advance  in  technology and the growth of the amount of content  on internet, it has become difficult for users to find  and utilise information and for content providers to  classify and catalogue documents. It was very time  consuming for users to browse and to get the required  information from the net1. The internet has become  a worldwide data communication system, changing  the way people look for information. The internet has  brought new forms of social interactions, networks,  and  online  activities  because  of  its  accessibility  and availability2. The growth of the internet has had  a  revolutionary  effect  on  society.  It  changes  the  obstacle  of  the  distance  from  the  communication  process. Web is a practical interface to a compound  network of computers and data. According to internet  World  Stats  (IWS),  in  Asia  alone,  there  are  about  1386.2  millions  of  internet  users  which  are  the  largest  number  of  internet  users  (45.7  %).  The  growth  of  world  total  internet  users  in  2013-2014  is  741.0  %  (Table  1)3.

Search  engines  play  a  vital  role  in  providing  the  exact  or  nascent  digital  information  to  the  users. With the passage of time, several techniques  and  technologies  have  emerged  for  handling  the  information  more  speedily  and  effectively.  Kumar  &  Kumar4   examined  how  Indian  academics  used  search  engines  to  retrieve  information.  Jansen  &  Spink5   examines  characteristics  and  changes  in  web  searching  from  nine  studies  of  five  web  
search engines based in the US and Europe. Singh6 analyse  the  search  engines  are  the  promoters  of  information  diffusion.  Brin  &  Page7   designed  to  crawl  and  index  the  web  efficiently  and  produce  much  more  satisfying  search  results  than  existing  systems  of  search  technique.The  seminal  work  by  McCown8,  et  al.   evaluate  three  search  engines  namely  Google,  MSN,  and  Yahoo  for  harvesting  OAI-PMH resource corpus using 10 million records  from 776 OAI-PMH repositories. Holscher & Strube9 pointed  out  that  experienced  and  novice  users  construct  searches  differently.  Hellgren10   explores  the  implementation  of  the  OAI-PMH  and  it  reveals  that users have come to expect instant and simple  access to qualitative information resources through  the use of internet search engines. Boston11  explores  application  of  technologies  such  as  the  OAI-PMH  to share deep web content through search engines  and  disclose  that  users  can  easily  find  information  from  the  deep  web  using  popular  search  engines.  Cole  &  Warner12   provide  an  overview  of  emerging  guidelines and best practices for OAI data providers  or  source  provider. 
Keane,  O'Brien  &  Smyth13   focused  search  engines  as  one  of  the  most  used  resources  on  the internet. Xiang & Margan14  describe the design  and  implementation  of  light  weight  protocols  and  open  source  tools.  These  protocols  and  tools  are  employed to collect, organise, archive and disseminate  information  freely  available  on  the  Internet. Again,  web  users  should  be  aware  that  limiting  searches  to  single  SEs  results  in  missing  substantial  pieces  of  information  ranked  highly  by  other  SEs  and  directories15 GLT’s  cross–language  search  consists  of three major processes: Query translation, search,

The study determines the search engines is an  effective  tool  for  library  professionals.  The  study  covers the various aspects of search engines including  background  of  search  engines,  and  how  search  engines  work.  Further  to  know  the  categories  of  search  engines.  Internet  search  techniques  i.e.  basic,  advanced  and  refine  search  are  analysed.  Furthermore, the study tries to know their effective  use  in  searching  information  on  internet  on  the  basis  of  Boolean  operators  AND,  OR,  NOT  and  proximity  searching,  etc.  
The  theoretical  and  hypothetical  methods  were  used  for  information  gathering.  Data  and  information  has  been  collected  from  national  as  well  as  international  esteemed  research  journal  in  information  and  computer  science  subjects  from  various  recognised  websites.  The  time  period  of  the  study  was  from  March-August  2015.

Search engines are tools for finding, classifying,  and storing information on various websites on the  internet.  They  can  help  in  locating  information  of  relevance  on  a  particular  subject  by  using  various  search  methods18. 
Encyclopedia Britannica defines “search engine  is a ‘computer program to find answers to queries in   collection  of  information,  which  might  be  a  library  catalogue or a database but is most commonly the  world  wide  web. A  Web  search  engine  produces  a  list of ‘pages’ computer files listed on the Web-that  contain  the  terms  in  a  query.  Most  search  engines  allow the user to join terms with ‘and’, ‘or’, and ‘not’  to refine queries. They may also search specifically

for  images,  videos,  or  news  articles  or  for  names  of  websites’’19. 
According  to  Computing  Dictionary,  ‘search  engine  is  a  program  that  allows  users  to  locate  specified  information  from  a  database  or  mass  of  data.  Search  engine  sites  are  extremely  popular  on  the  world  wide  web  because  they  allow  users  to  quickly  shift  through  millions  of  documents  on  the  internet’20. 
Dictionary  of  Computing  and  Digital  Media  defines  search  engine  as,  ‘a  database  from  that  allows  a  user  to  seek  information  on  the  internet  by  keyword.  Search  engines  may  look  for  titles  of  documents,  URLs,  headers,  or  text’21. 
In Que's Computer & internet Dictionary defines  search  engine  as,  ‘a  program  that  locates  needed  information in a database, but especially an internet- accessible  search  service  that  enables  users  to  search  for  information  on  the  internet’22. 
According to Beiser, ‘a search engine enables a  user of e-data resources to quickly locate the specific  information  desired  from  within  a  large  volume  of  mostly  unrelated  extraneous  information’23. 
Moreover,  one  can  say  that  search  engines  have  become  an  essential  tool  in  internet  usage,  and  particularly  in  searching  the  world  wide  web. Internet  World  Usage  and  population  statistics  June  30,  2014  estimated  3,035,749,340  peoples  around  the  world  were  online  or  42.3  %  of  the  total  world  population  Table  1.  StatCounter  Global  Stats  (SCGS)  focused  Google  had  92.2  %  of  the  total  search  engine  market,  Bing  (3.73  %),  Yahoo!  (3.43 %), Baidu (0.53 %), Ask (0.42 %) and others  search  engines  are  using  (0.13  %).Google’s  world  dominance  is  clear,  but  in  leading  markets  China,  Japan,  Russia,  and  South  Korea,  local  favorites  draw  many  more  searchers  than  Google  (Fig.1)24.

make  it  more  popular  among  the  users.  Though,  there are some general rules that apply to the way  every  search  engine  works.  Each  search  engine  
figure 1. Stat counter global stats for search engines. performs  three  main  tasks:  (a)  Searches  for  web  pages available in the www and stores information  about  them.  (b)Indexes  the  retrieved  information  about  the  web  pages  found  and,  consequently,  a  database  is  created,  and  (c)  allows  for  the  users  to  search  its  database/index  through  an  interface  providing searching facilities and options which the  user  can  use  at  his  or  her  discretion16. 
For the first task, search engines use computer  programs  (i.e.  software)  called bots  also  known  as  robots,  spiders,  (web)  crawlers,  worms,  intelligent  agents,  knowledgebots  or  knowbots.  Whatever  name  is  used  to  refer  to  them,  they  all  perform  the  same  function:  They  ‘surf’  or  ‘crawl’  the  web  by  following  links  from  one  webpage  or  website  to  the  next  and  collect  information  which  they  store  in  their  database25.  Further,  new  websites  are  made  available  constantly  and  search  engines  have  to  make  sure  that  the  results  they  display  to  their  users  are  up-to-date  so  as  for  them  to  be  competitive  in  the  search  engine  market.  Usually,  spiders  do  not  work  one  at  a  time  to  cover  a  search  engine’s  needs.  At  its  peak  performance,  using  four  spiders,  their  system  could  crawl  over  100  pages  per  second,  generating  around  600  kilobytes  of  data  each  second26.  Spiders  collect  data to be analysed to produce indexes to be kept  within the search engine’s database. What is to be

indexed  depends  on  how  each  search  engine  has  decided  to  use  the  information  available  on  each  of  the  web  pages  collected.  Some  search  engines  uses  the  full-text  provided,  some  keep  part  of  the  original  mark-up  tags  and  some  others  take  into  consideration  both  content  and  link  when  building  indexes  based  on  the  three  most  popular  models  for information retrieval: Boolean, vector space and  probabilistic.  Each  search  engine  will  emphasise  and  base  their  indexes  on  different  aspects  and  content of websites with different strategy followed  both  during  the  gathering  and  the  indexing  of  information16. 
6. cATEGOrIES  Of   SEA rcH  ENGINES 
The important categories of search engines can  be  summarised  as: 
6.1  Primary  or robot  Driven  Search  Engines 
These search engines compile their own searchable  databases  on  the  web.  Crawler  or  worm  programs  generate databases by means of web robots. These  robots are programs that reside on a host computer  and retrieve information from sites on the web using  standard  protocols.  In  effect,  they  automatically  travel  the  internet  following  links  from  documents  and  collecting  information  according  to  the  HTML  structure  of  the  documents  (i.e.,  URL,  document  title,  keywords,  etc.),  about  the  resources,  they  come  across  (Table  2). 
6.2  Directory-based  Search  Engines 
Directories are the yellow pages of the internet.  They  contain  information  that  has  been  submitted  to  them  by  their  indexers  or  by  users  who  submit  entries.  The  subject  directories  are  often  manually  maintained,  browsable,  and  searchable  web-based  interfaces27. 
Yahoo!  is  the  most  famous  subject  directory.  Yahoo!  has  several  subject  headings.  A  subject  directory  contains  information  that  is  organised  into  categories  and  subcategories  or  topics  and  subtopics.  Like  a  search  engine,  one  can  search  a  subject  directory  for  all  entries  that  contain  a

particular set of keywords. Although directories can  be searched using keywords, it is often as easy to  click on a category, and then click through specific  subdirectories  until  one  finds  the  desired  subject.  These  directories  offer  access  to  the  information  that  has  been  classified  into  certain  categories.  They  group  the  internet  websites  into  categories  such  as  Internet  tutorials,  universities,  museum,  etc.  (Table  3)28. 
6.3  Meta-search  Engines 
Meta-search  engines,  also  known  as  mega  indexes, do not have their own searchable database.  They utilise databases maintained by other individual  search  engines.  A  meta-search  engine  accepts  a  single query from the user and sends it to multiple  search  engines  in  parallel.  Such  search  engines  are also called multi-threaded search engines. Ask  Jeeves,  MetaCrawler,  Savvy  Search,  @Once!, All- in-One Search Page, Internet Sleuth, Magellan, Net  Search, Dogpile, Metacrawler, Metafind, Metasearch,  ixquick.com  are  some  of  the  betterknown  meta  search  engines  (Table  4). 
6.4  Software  Tools 
These tools are classified as ‘browsing companions’  or ‘browser search bots’. Software tools are similar

6.5  Subject-specific  Search  Engines 
Subject-specific search engine concentrate on one  particular  topic  and  often  provide  better  access  to  information than powerful keyword indexes. Besides,  subject-specific  search  engines  as  an  organised  and structured guide to Internet-based e-information  resources that are carefully selected after a predefined  process of evaluation and filtration in a subject area  or specialty. For instance, Health A to Z, Math, Agri,  Surf,  Law  Crawler,  etc.Furthermore,subject  portals  are LibrarySpot, Librarian’s Index to Internet, Argus  Clearing  House,  BIOME,  BUBL,  etc.  (Table  5). 
6.6  Geographical Area  Search  Engines 
Geographic  web  search  engines  allow  users  to  query  on  a  particular  geographic  region.  The  concern  of  geographic  area  is  to  narrow  down  the  searches.  Also  the  web  is  being  customised  in  different national and regional language giving space  for  the  webpages  in  different  languages.  This  too  indicates  the  need  of  a  geographic  area  specific  search engine, since languages are geographic area  bound.  For  example,  as  Chinese  language  content  becomes  more  readily  available  on  the  Web,  there  are more than 10 Chinese search engines available  on  the  net  (Table  6). 
6.7  Hybrid  Search  Engines 
In  the  past,  a  search  engine  located  either  crawler-based  results  or  human-powered  listings.  Nowadays,  it  is  very  common  for  search  engines  to  present  both  types  of  results.  Usually,  a  hybrid  search engine favours one type of listings over the  other.  For  example,  MSN  search  is  more  likely  to  present  human-powered  listings  from  LookSmart.  However, it does also present crawler-based results,  especially  for  more  obscure  queries29.

7.1  Searching  Subject  Directories 
Subject directories are created and maintained  by  the  directory's  staff,  allowing  users  to  browse  

========5========

HUSSAIN: SEARCH  E NGINES AS AN  E FFECTIVE  T OOL FOR  L IBRARY  P ROFESSIONALS 
internet  resources  by  different  subject  categories,  and  enable  users  to  search  by  keywords  within  the  contents  of  the  directories.  For  example,  a  search  conducted  on  Google  search  engine  and  one  of  the  results  happens  to  be  in  the  Google’s  Directory.  Google  will  offer  a  link  to  that  section  of  the directory. Similarly, results for a search conducted  in  the  Google  directory,  are  arranged  according  to  PageRank, which is Google’s all-important measure  of  ‘link  popularity’. 
7.2  Searching  Search  Engines 
Searching is one of the most popular activities  on  the  internet.  Search  engines  have  become  an  essential  part  of  everyone’s  lives.  There  are  big  three  search  engines  of  Google,  Yahoo!  and  Bing  already. When a user makes a query to the search  engine,  the  query  is  checked  against  the  search  engine’s  index  of  all  the  web  pages  and  relevant  documents  with  their  URLs  are  returned  as  hits.  These hits are ranked in order of relevance with the  best  results  on  the  top.  Most  search  engines  offer  two  types  of  interfaces  to  search  their  databases,  i.e.,  basic  search  and  advanced  search. 
7.2.1  Basic  Search  
Most  search  engines  offer  a  dialog  box,  pane  or a dialog line where search terms can be keyed- in  followed  by  options  to  either  submit  or  clear  the  search.  Most  search  engines  query  their  database  using  keywords.  A  user  enters  a  word  or  words  called  ‘keywords  or  search  terms’  that  he  or  she  would like to search. The search engine then looks  through  its  indexes  in  the  database  for  matches.  It  might  look  in  the  title,  description  or  entire  text  of  a  webpage.  
7.2.2  Advanced  Search  or  Refining  Search  
Different search engines have different methods  of  refining  queries.  The  advanced  or  refine  search  were  located  under  titled  ‘Refining  Your  Search  Results-Yahoo  Help’  as  well  as  different  search  engines  such  as  Google,  Yahoo!  and  MSN,  etc.  were  identified.  Options  for  advanced  search  differ  from  one  search  engine  to  another,  but  some  of  the  common  features  include  ability  to  search  on  more  than  one  word,  to  confine  the  search  to  a  specified  field  and  to  exclude  a  word  that  is  not  required  in  a  search  by  the  user. A  user  may  also  search  for  proper  names,  phrases,  and  on  words  that  are  found  within  a  certain  proximity  to  other  search  terms30. 
7.2.3  Boolean  Operator 
Boolean  logic  was  devised  by  George  Boole  in  184731. Boolean  operators  link  search  terms: AND,  OR  and  NOT.  These  are  usually  explained  using  Venn  diagrams,  such  as: 
(i) ‘AND’  Connector  
In  two  terms  the  search  strategy  are  linked  using  the  logical  operator  AND  then  the  output  will  be  the  items  in  which  both  the  terms  are  used  in  title  or  abstract.  This  increases  the  specificity  and  ensures  greater  precision,  which  means  only  relevant  documents  will  be  listed  on  the  computer  screen  as  a  result  of  the  search  (Fig.  2). 
figure 2. The AND connector. 
Moreover,  the  Boolean  AND  connection  is  search sometimes referred to as: intersection (\) or  conjunction (L). For Example, if a user is searching  for  documents  in  "Potato  Blight"  it  is  required  to  select  the  combination  search  option  and  give  the  two words in the combination search connected by  the  term  AND.  
(ii)  ‘OR’  Connector 
The OR connector helps the user to search for  documents  using  alternate  terms.  If,  two  terms  are  linked using OR logic in a search the output will be  a list of documents which contain any one of these  terms in title or abstract content (Fig. 3). Moreover,  OR  is  used  to  link  together  synonyms,  lexical  and  morphological  variants,  and  terms  that  are  close  in  meaning  in  the  context  of  a  particular  search.  However,  one  can  use  mathematical  formula,  i.e.,  alternative  terms  and  notation  for  OR  are:  union  (|);  disjunction  (V). 
figure 3. The Or  connector. 
(iii)  ‘NOT’  Connector 
The use of NOT is to exclude particular terms.  The output of such search will exclude documents,  which contain the term right to the operator NOT in  the  search  strategy.  Besides,  the  use  of  the  NOT  connector is to avoid retrieving irrelevant documents.  For  example  ‘promotion  NOT  advertising’  might  be  used to exclude items concerning the promotion of  goods and services from a search on job promotion  (Fig. 4). Though, one can use mathematical formula,  that is, alternative terms and notation for NOT are:  complement  (–);  negation  (~).

7.2.4  Phrase  Searching 
The ability to query on phrases is very important  in  a  search  engine.  A  phrase  is  a  group  of  words  that  must  appear  next  to  each  other  in  a  specified  order.  Most  search  engines  support  this  feature.  It  can  be  used  when  the  search  terms  appear  in  an  exact  order.  To  indicate  a  phrase,  surround  it  in  double  quotation  marks  (“  ”).  For  example:  “Web- based  library  services” 
7.2.5  Proximity  Searching 
Proximity  is  the  search  technique  used  to  find  two  words  next  to,  near,  or  within  a  specified  distance  of  each  other  within  a  document.  It  is  used  to  specify  the  relative  location  of  words  in  a  document.  These  operators  facilitate  searching  for  words that must be in the same phrase, paragraph,  or sentence in a record. For example, a search may  require that two concepts be in the same sentence  but  not  necessarily  next  to  each  other,  as  in  a  phrase.  One  such  operator  is  NEAR  which  means  that  the  terms  that  are  entered  should  be  within  a  certain  number  of  words  to  each  other.  
7.2.6  Parentheses 
Most search engines permit the use of parentheses  to group related terms. This is particularly useful for  clustering synonyms or for searching specific terms  together before other terms is searched. Parentheses  may  be  used  in  combination  with  other  search  techniques.  For  example:  (Library  Computerisation  or  Library  ‘near’ Automation)  and  India. 
7.2.7  Truncation  and  Wildcards 
Truncation  (stemming)  is  a  technique  that  facilitates  search  for  multiple  endings  of  a  word. Most  search  engines  that  support  this  feature  use  certain  symbols  (called  ‘wild  card’)  such  as  *,?  $  or  #  at  the  end  of  the  word  root  to  indicate  a  truncated  search. 
The following examples show how to construct  a  search  using  truncation: 
• class*  (retrieves  class,  classification,  classify,  
class  no.) 
• catalogu*  (retrieves  catalogue,  catalogues,  
c a t a l o g u i n g ,   c a t a l o g u e ,   c a t a l o g u e s ,  
catalogued) 
It  is  generally  a  good  idea  to  truncate  longer  
395 
word  roots. Truncating  shorter  roots,  such  as  cat*,  will usually result in several hits, with many irrelevant  results.  Wildcards  can  also  be  used  for  internal  truncation.  Internal  truncation  is  generally  used  to  search  for  words  that  may  differ  by  one  or  two  letters within a word. Some instances are words with  British  and  American  spellings.  Following  indicate  how  to  use  the  wildcard  feature: 
• wom*n  (retrieves  woman  or  women) 
• colo*r  (retrieves  colour  or  color) 
• hono*r  (retrieves  honour  or  honor) 
Wild  cards  (*  in  the  example)  may  vary  from  search  engines  to  search  engines. 
7.2.8  Case  Sensitivity 
Case  sensitive  searching  allows  searches  for  words that differ in meaning based on different use  of  uppercase  and  lowercase  letters.  Most  search  engines are not case sensitive and will simply read  all  letters  as  lowercase.  Others  may  distinguish  between  the  word  ‘aids’  and  the  disease  ‘AIDS’.  Using  lower  case  is  advised,  because  lower  case  will always retrieve upper case as well. For example,  the  month  of  March  is  very  different  from  what  a  marching  band  does.  A  person  from  Poland  is  Polish,  but  you  polish  silver.32 
7.2.9  Field  Searching 
A  typical  web  page  is  composed  of  the  major  fields:  title,  host  (or  site),  domain,  URL,  and  link.  Where  available,  field  searching  on  the  web  is  a  very powerful tool. It allows users to specify exactly  where  users  want  the  search  engine  to  look  in  the  web  document33.  Further,  ‘Fields’  are  the  various  pieces  of  information  that  library  databases  (like  Summon,  EBSCO,  ProQuest,  etc.)  keep  for  each  item  that  they  search.  Each  time  users  search  for  a  keyword,  the  database  looks  for  it  in  the  fields. 
7.2.10  Concept  Searching 
A  concept  search  is  an  automated  information  retrieval method that is used to search electronically  stored unstructured text (for example, digital archives,  email,  scientific  literature,  etc.)  for  information  that  is  conceptually  similar  to  the  information  provided  in  a  search  query34.  Moreover,  it  is  a  keyword  search  systems,  concept-based  search  systems  try  to  determine  what  a  user  means.  In  the  best  circumstances, a concept-based search returns hits  on  documents  that  are  ‘about’  the  subject/theme  that  is  being  explored,  even  if  the  words  in  the  document  do  not  precisely  match  the  query35,6. 
7.2.11  Natural  Language  Searching  
The natural language searching feature allows a  user to search in the same language as it is spoken.

HUSSAIN: SEARCH  E NGINES AS AN  E FFECTIVE  T OOL FOR  L IBRARY  P ROFESSIONALS 
Suppose a user wants to know who Mahatma Gandhi  was? His/her query would be: “Who was Mahatama  Gandhi?”  The  search  engine  that  supports  this  technique  retrieves  relevant  webpages  that  would  answer  this  question36. 
8.    ADvANTAGES   AND  DISAD vANTAGES   O f 
SEArcH  ENGINES 
Millions of people around the world use search  engine  almost  every  day.  To  expand  knowledge  easily,  there  is  no  doubt  that  everyone  must  have  something  he  did  not  know.  In  ancient  times  when  people  wanted  to  know  something  beyond  their  abilities, they often went for books or knowledgeable  persons.  But  nowadays,  one  can  simply  put  some  keywords in search box and then in less than second,  thousands of useful answers will show on computer  screen.  It  saves  the  precious  time  to  users. 
But search engine also has disadvantages. Firstly,  search engine provide way too much useless results.  Sometimes one even cannot find anything useful from  searching  results.  It  wastes  much  time  to  pick  up  useful information from ocean of searching results.  Second,  those  who  use  search  engine  frequently  may become lazy. Every time they meet difficulties  they just go for search engine. Third, search engine  may bring people to various pornographic websites.  However  search  engine  can  benefit  a  lot,  one  needs  to  use  it  carefully  to  gain  what  one  wants  and  avoid  harmful  information.  
9. cONcLUSIONS 
Search-engines are among the most used resources  on the internet. Google, for example, now hosts over  eight  billion  items  and  returns  answers  to  queries  in  a  fraction  of  a  second,  thus  realising  some  of  the  most  incredible  predictions  envisioned  by  the  pioneers of the world wide web37,7. Further internet  search engines are considered the biggest source of  information and finds an important place in libraries  as  quickest  means  to  access  information  at  any  time. But it requires the help of search engines for  the  effective  and  optimum  use.  However,  search  engine  is  an  aid  to  find  pin-pointed  information  to  save  time  of  the  users.
