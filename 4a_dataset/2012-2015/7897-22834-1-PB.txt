The present paper is based on the survey conducted to assess the status of application of open  source software (OSS) in India. The analysis of the study revealed that 91 institutions in India using OSS  for  library  management  and  OPAC  of  these  institutions  are  accessible  in  public  domain. There  are  96  open access repositories created by using OSS which are accessible in public domain. The study also  discloses that 8 institutions in India have two open access digital repositories each which are created by  OSS and 14 institutions are using OSS for library automation as well as for digital library.

1.   Intr OductIOn 
Open source software (OSS) is gaining popularity  in  the  library  profession  nowadays  and  emerged  as  an  alternative  model  of  and  revolutionised  the  software  development.  In  the  last  decade,  several  attempts were made to develop software for libraries  on open source platform and as a result, many open  source  library  automation  software,  open  source  digital  library  software  and  other  useful  OSS  for  libraries  drawing  the  attention  of  librarians.  Avanti  Library  Systems  grew  out  of  a  project  started  in  1998 by Peter Schlumpf to develop a simple low cost  open  source  library  system  for  small  libraries.  The  Evergreen Project was initiated by the Georgia Public  Library  System  in  2006.  Greenstone  software  was  originally  released  in  2000.  E-print  was  developed  at  the  University  of  Southampton,  UK  and  its  first  version  was  released  in  2000.  The  first  version  of  DSpace was released in November 2002. KOHA that  was originally developed by Katipo Communications  Limited,  New  Zealand  for  the  Horowhenua  Library  Trust in 1999 was released as free software under  General  Public  License  in  2000.  On  9  January  2008,  New  GenLib  was  declared  Open  Source  Software under GNU GPL License by Verus Solutions.  VuFind was developed and maintained at Villanova  University’s  Falvey  Memorial  Library  and  released  in 2007. Open Journal Systems (OJS)  is  an  online  journal  management  and  publishing  platform  that  was  first  launched  in  2002  as  OSS. 
The  term  OSS  can  be  confusing  at  times.  Typically,  people  associate  OSS  with  software  that  you can download and install for free. This definition  focuses  solely  on  the  cost  aspect.  However,  some  OSS  can  be  downloaded  and  installed  for  free,  cost  really  is  not  what  OSS  is  about.  As  its  core,  OSS  is  about  the  freedom  to  adopt  and  customise  software1. 
Open source software can be defined as computer  software  for  which  the  human-readable  source  code  is  made  available  under  a  copyright  license  that meets the open source definition. This permits  users  to  use,  change,  and  improve  the  software,  and  to  distribute  it  in  modified  or  unmodified  form.  It is very often developed in a public, collaborative  manner.  
1.1  Open  Source  Software  for  Libraries 
1.1.1  KOHA 
KOHA is the first open-source integrated library  system  (ILS)  that  was  originally  developed  by  katipo  communications  limited,  New  Zealand  for  the  Horowhenua  Library  Trust  in  1999.  KOHA  was  released  as  free  software  under  general  public  license  in  2000.  It  supports  all  modules  of  library  applications  as  well  as  has  support  for  Z39.50  server, multilingual support, supports library standards  such  as  MARC-21/UNIMARC,  OAI-PMH,  ISO-2709  and  also  supports  several  next  generation  OPAC

features.  KOHA  community  has  been  providing  support  through  its  mailing  lists  and  IRC  rooms.  Software has detailed online manual and there are  several power-point presentations available on various  modules  of  KOHA  on  internet.  Many  commercial  vendors  provide  support  for  KOHA.  In  India,  OSS  Labs, Mumbai,; Open LX, Anant Corporation, Mumbai,  etc., are the main commercial players who provide  support for KOHA. The software can handle millions  of  records  and  transactions2. 
1.1.2  NewGenLib 
NewGenLib is an integrated library management  system  developed  by  Verus  Solutions  Pvt  Ltd.  Domain  expertise  is  provided  by  Kesavan  Institute  of  Information  and  Knowledge  Management  in  Hyderabad,  India.  NewGenLib  version  1.0  was  released  in  March  2005.  The  software  has  been  distributed under the traditional commercial license  model since 2003. In January 2008, a decision was  made  to  offer  the  system  as  OSS  under  the  GNU  GPL (General Public License). On 9 January 2008,  NewGenLib  was  declared  OSS  under  GNU  GPL  Licence  by  Verus  Solutions.  Functional  modules  of  NewGenLib are completely web-based. NewGenLib  complies with international metadata and interoperability  standards: MARC-21, MARC-XML, Z39.50, SRU/w,  OAI-PMH. 
1.1.3  OpenBiblio 
OpenBiblio3,  which  is  being  developed  by  a  small  number  of  people,  has  been  an  off  and  on  again  project.  Development  activity  peaked  in  2006-2007  with  the  release  of  its  0.6.0  version.  The  latest  version  0.7.1  has  been  released  on  18  March 2012. This version 0.7.1. is recommended for  new installations and for updating older versions of  OpenBiblio,  including  all  versions  from  openbiblio. de. The product includes cataloging, circulation, and  patron  access  catalog  modules.  The  programming  languages  are  PHP  and  LAMP,  and  the  operating  system  is  Linux.  UNIMARC  is  supported.  There  is  an  online  demo  and  software  can  be  downloaded.  There is no reliable scalability information for LAMP.  Openbilio  runs  under  Linux  or  windows,  any  web  server,  PHP,  and  MySQL. 
1.1.4  DSpace 
DSpace  has  been  designed  and  developed  by  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  (MIT)  libraries  and  Hewlett-Packard  (HP).  DSpace  was  designed  as  an  open  source  application  so  that  institutions  could  run  with  relatively  few  resources.  It  is  to  support  the  long-term  preservation  of  the  digital  material  stored  in  the  repository.  It  is  also  designed to make submission easy. DSpace supports  submission,  management,  and  access  of  digital  
contents.  DSpace  can  be  installed  on  Linux,  Unix  and  windows.  DSpace  is  freely  available  under  BSD  licence.  It  is  a  platform  that  allows  users  to capture  items  in  any  format–in  text,  video,  audio,  and  data.  It  indexes  work,  so  users  can  search  and  retrieve  items.  DSpace  provides  a  way  to  manage  research  materials  and  publications  in  a  professionally  maintained  repository  to  give  them  greater  visibility  and  accessibility  over  time.  1.1.5  E-prints 
E-prints  was  developed  at  the  University  of  Southampton, UK with the first version of the software  publicly  released  in  2000. As  the  first  professional  software  platform  for  building  high-quality  OAI- compliant repositories, E-prints is already established  as the easiest and fastest way to set up repositories  of  open  access  research  literature,  scientific  data,  theses,  reports,  and  multimedia.  E-prints  3  is  a  major  leap  forward  in  functionality,  giving  even  more control and flexibility to repository managers,  depositors, researchers and technical administrators.  The  latest  version  of  E-prints:  v3.3.10  is  available  for  Debian/Ubuntu,  Redhat/Fedora  and  windows.  In  brief,  E-prints  requires Apache  (with  mod_perl),  MySQL  and  Perl  with  some  extra  modules. 1.1.6  Greenstone 
Greenstone4   is  a  suite  of  software  for  building  and distributing digital library collections. It provides  a new way of organising information and publishing it  on the internet. Greenstone is produced by the New  Zealand  Digital  Library  Project  at  the  University  of  waikato, and developed and distributed in cooperation  with  UNESCO  and  the  Human  Info  NGO.  It  is  open-source,  multilingual  software,  issued  under  the terms of the GNU General Public License. The  aim  of  software  is  to  empower  users,  particularly  in  universities,  libraries,  and  other  public  service  institutions,  to  build  their  own  digital  libraries.  Greenstone was originally released in 2000. Greenstone  is  mainly  programmed  in  C++  and  Perl  and  runs  on  all  versions  of  windows,  and  Unix/Linux,  and  Mac OS-X. The complete Greenstone interface and  all documentation are available in English, French,  Russian and Kazakh. Greenstone also has interface  in  many  other  languages.

Patra5,  et  al.,   in  their  paper  discussed  the  management of institutional repository in India using  DSpace and presented the status of the digitisation  of  IR  in  India.  Jose6   in  his  survey  concluded  that  DSpace  is  the  most  widely  used  digital  library  software in India with 13 installations. E-prints and  Greenstone are also used in India. However, digital  libraries  based  on  Fedora  could  not  be  found.

Sheeja7   identified  the  extent  of  adoption  of  KOHA,  an  open  source  ILS  in  libraries  around  the  world through a web-based study. The study found  that  only  212  libraries  are  currently  registered  themselves  in  KOHA  user  group.  There  may  be  some  more  libraries  that  are  using  KOHA  but  not  registered  themselves  in  the  user  group.  The  study  revealed  that  out  of  20  KOHA  installations  in  India,  the  major  groups  of  libraries  belong  to  Kerala  6  (30  %),  Karnataka  3  (15  %),  and  Tamil  Nadu  3  (15  %). 
Biswas & Paul8  identified the extent of adoption  of  open  source  digital  library  software  in  various  Institutions through online survey. They also compared  the  features  of  DSpace  and  Greenstone.  In  their  web  survey,  it  has  found  that  72  institutions  have  installation  of  the  repository  software  in  various  parts  of  the  world.  DSpace  with  42  installations  seem  to  be  the  most  popular  choice  among  the  digital  library  software  packages  and  Greenstone  has  seven  installations. 
Kumar & Jasimudeen9  provide a brief picture of  KOHA software adoption and the users’ perception  about  it  in  the  Indian  library  scenario.  They  found  that  the  software  is  popular  among  the  southern  states  of  India  and  the  number  of  KOHA  users  in  India  is  growing. 
Roy10, et  al.,  conducted  an  analytical  study  of  institutional repositories in India and found that open  source digital library packages are gaining popularity  nowadays.  The  different  IRs  use  different  types  of  OSS like DSpace, E-prints, Greenstone, Nitya, etc.,  Few IRs have not mentioned about type of software  used.  The  study  found  that  the  DSpace  software  has  the  most  installations  35  (59  %),  followed  by  E-prints 20 (33 %). Greenstone is used by 2 (3 %)  repository  and  ranks  at  3rd   position.  Nitya  is  used  by  only  1  repository.

The  main  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: (a) Assess  the  status  of  open  source  software  in  
India 
(b) Institutions using open source software for library  
automation  and/or  for  institutional  repositories  
in  public  domain? 
(c) Distribution of open source software in various  
states.  
(d) Institutions  by  their  type  using  OSS  for  library  
automation and institutional repository in public  
domain. 
4. MethO dOLOgy 
Various  sources  have  been  used  to  find  out  the  users  of  OSS  in  India  such  as  visiting  users’  list  available  on  the  website  of  respective  OSS,  consulting  case  studies  and  research  papers  on  
32 
OSS,  searching  on  internet  and  communication  with  library  professionals  through  various  mailing  lists  such  as  NMLIS,  LIS-Forum,  etc. 
Many  academic  institutions  claim  that  they  are  using  OSS  for  library  automation  and  digital  library. According to the list of KOHA users which is  worldwide  maintained  by  KOHA  project  volunteers;  83 libraries in India are using KOHA. The Directory  of Open Access Repositories (http://www.opendoar. org/)  and  Registry  of  Open  Access  Repositories  listed  many  Indian  institutions  using  OSS  for  their  digital/ institutional repository but this study included  only  those  institutions  that  could  be  verified  by  online  accessing  to  their  online  library  catalogue  and digital/institutional repository as on April 2014.  The  data  collected  through  various  methods  about  institutions  that  are  using  OSS  was  analysed  and  presented.

Information  technology  has  important  role  in  rural, industrial, cultural and research development  of any country. It is virtually impossible to carry out  any  meaningful  educational  activities  without  the  help  of  libraries  and  information  services.  There  are  many  OSS  applications  available  for  every  educational  activities  including  library  automation,  content management system, instituional repository,  learning  management,  and  digital  library.  OSS  can  offer  cheap  and  advanced  solutions  to  Indian  libraries. The library professionals of India awareness,  perceptions and intentions to adopt OSS in libraries  but  most  of  library  professionals  in  India  still  lack  of  required  technical  knowledge  and  facilities  for

successfull  implementation  of  OSS  in  libraries.  However,  adoptions  of  OSS  in  Indian  libraries  is  increasing  day  by  day  but  at  slow  speed.  while  a  number  of  open  source  library  management  software  users  reported  in  India  but  the  numbers  of  OPACs  that  are  operational  and  available  in  public  domain  are  fewer.  It  is  clear  from  the  study  that only 91 institutions in India using open source  library  management  software  with  their  OPAC  in  public domain. Out of 91 institutions, 73 institutions  are using KOHA, 10 organisation using NewGenLib  and  8  institutions  using  OpenBiblio.
