ABSTRACT
The objective of this study is to examine the linking on websites of national libraries and to find out their
web impact factor and amount of information present on these websites in the form of rich files. The methodology
which is followed in this study is basically investigative in nature. For the purpose of analysing the link
structure, data is collected in the month of December 2009, January 2010, April 2010, and May 2010. The
research revealed that among the selected national libraries, websites of national libraries’ of America, Australia
and Britain were more visible and hosted the more content compare to the websites of India, Namibia, and
South Africa. A short survey is conducted to find the number of functional national libraries websites in the
world. Among the 163 countries (which have national libraries) 106 countries have the websites. In this study
two national libraries are selected from each continents of the world except American continent.
Keywords: National library, website, webometrics, web impact factor

1. INTRODUCTION
Libraries form a vital part of the world’s system of
education and information storage and retrieval. National
libraries advance the achievement of national goals,
economic development and adequate resources, through
the provision of relevant and timely information. They
promote and develop the nation’s cultural heritage,
promote literacy, and achieve national goals in the field of
library and information services. Nowadays, via ICTassisted dynamic environment, national libraries have
very suitable facilities for playing their role. Undoubtedly,
one powerful website is adequate for meeting users’
needs of national libraries in anywhere. As the world wide
web becomes a global tool of information, national
libraries have a great chance of contributing much
valuable information through their websites. With libraries
shifting their role from being custodians of collectionbased traditional information resources to being providers
of access-based digital information resources, the library
websites have assumed importance.
Libraries have to disseminate and facilitate access to
variety of information to users through their websites. To
succeed, however, the sites must be well-organised,
informative, easy to navigate, and accessible in both
native and foreign languages. National libraries need to
make necessary investments for introducing and making

accessible their website content. For this, the national
libraries should invest on designing and managing of
websites.

2. OBJECTIVES OF STUDY
The national library has a unique role to play in
meeting the information needs of all citizens of a country.
It is a custodian and provider of the nation’s key
knowledge resources. Many national libraries have their
own websites to provide a view of their collection, services
and activities but, despite that, there has been relatively
little analysis on the visibility on the web and linking with
other webpages. This brings us to an unavoidable stand
wherein an analysis of the linking and visibility of these
websites has become extremely vital. The present study
was carried out to examine the linking on websites of
national libraries and to find out their web impact factor
(WIF) and amount of information present on these
websites in the form of rich files.

3. SCOPE AND LIMITATION
According to IFLA1 (International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutions), there are 163 national
libraries including those claiming function but not having
the actual title. In this study two national libraries are
selected from each continent of the world except

American continent because most of the websites of
national libraries are available in their national language
only. For this study nine websites of national libraries are
selected. The libraries covers in this study are as shown
in Table 1.

4. METHODOLOGY
The methodology followed is basically investigative in
nature. The methodologies followed at the different stages
of the research to draw the conclusions are review of
literature, online searching, and calculation of WIF. For
the purpose of analysing the link structure, data is
collected in the month of December 2009, January 2010,
April 2010 and May 2010. After collecting the data of two
months, a gap is given for two month to observe the
variation and after that again data is collected for another
two months. The purpose of this is to find out trend of
growth of webpages and in-links.

search engine database at a specific time. The WIF
provides quantitative tools for ranking, evaluating,
categorising, and comparing websites, top-level domains
and sub-domains. Compared with the content of a journal
paper, the content of a web resource lacks peer review
and thus lacks quality control. The WIF is therefore not
exactly the equivalent of the journal impact factor (JIF).
However, the WIF was inspired by the JIF. There are three
types of links:
(a) Outlinks: Outgoing links from webpages
(b) Inlinks/backlinks: Links coming into a site from other
sites
(c) Self-links: Links within the same site (from one page
to another page)
There are three types of WIF:
(a) Overall WIF

5. WEBOMETRICS

(b) Inlink (revised) WIF

The term webometrics was first coined by Almind &
Ingwersenl. The science of webometrics tries to measure
the world wide web to get knowledge about the number
and types of hyperlinks, structure of the world wide web
and usage patterns. According to Bjorneborn and
Ingwersen the definition of webometrics is the study of the
quantitative aspects of the construction and use of
information resources, structures and technologies on the
web drawing on bibliometric and informetric approaches’2.
A second definition of webometrics has also been
introduced by Thelwall3 as ‘the study of web-based
content with primarily quantitative methods for social
science research goals using techniques that are not
specific to one field of study’3. Similar scientific fields are:
Bibliometrics, informetrics, scientometrics, and web
mining.

(c) Self-link WIF

5.1 Web Impact Factor (WIF)
The idea of measuring WIF as one of the quantitative
indicators (or the average link frequencies) was developed
in 1998 by Peter Ingwersen. The WIF is a ‘snapshot’ of a

For calculation of the overall WIF of a website, the
numerator is the number of inlink page from outside the
site and self-link pages within the site. For the inlink (or
revised) WIF, the numerator is the number of inlink pages
counted from outside the site. And for self- link WIF,
numerator is number of self-link pages counted from
within site. In all these cases, the denominator remains
the same, i.e., the number of webpages within the
website. The calculation for WIF is:
WIF= A/D
A= Total link pages (all inlink and self-link pages);
D= Number of webpages published in the website which
are indexed by the search engine, not all webpages
available in the website:
The calculation for revised WIF to exclude self-links is:
Revised WIF= (B/D)

number of webpages. The NLI has the lowest number of
webpages in all the four months during which the data is
collected. Number of webpages increased on the website
of BL in all the four months. On the other hand webpages
are increased in the first two months on the websites of
GNL, LC, and NLSA and after two months gap when again
data is collected the webpages are decreased in April and
in May again it increased. The NLN website has minimum
number of change in number of webpages. Number of
webpages increased and decreased over a time shows,
that websites are regularly maintained and updated.
Inlinks data reveals that among all the libraries, LC has
the highest number of inlinks during all the months in
which data is collected (Table 3). NLN has the lowest
number of inlinks in all the four months during which the
data is collected. Number of inlinks are changing on all
the websites, they are not static, which shows that the
websites are regularly loaded by current information and
outdated information is removed after a time period.

B= Inlinks to the website (this is a subset of A);
C=Self-link and navigational links within the same
website;
D= number of webpages published in the website which
are indexed by the search engine, not all webpages
available in the website4.
WIF is a form of measurement used to determine the
relative standing of websites in particular fields, or a
country; for instance, academic websites in a country.
The higher the impact factor, higher is the perceived
reputation of the website. The WIF answers the question
‘what impact has this website had?’ A WIF is a measure
of the frequency with which the average webpage in a
website has been linked at a given point of time. In
general, a website with a higher impact factor may be
considered to be more prestigious or of a higher quality
than those websites with a lower impact factor.

6.2 Calculation of Web Impact Factor
The calculation of the WIF requires two types of data,
namely, number of webpages and number of inlinks of a
website. Both these data have already been given in the
former tables. Thus, calculation of WIF is done, for which,
the calculated values are displayed in the Table 4. This
data is also presented in a month-wise manner, i.e., for
each month a separate WIF value was calculated. The
last column in Table 4 gives the average of the four months
for easy ranking.

6. DATA ANALYSIS
For the purpose of analysing the link structure, the
data is collected in the month of December 2009, January
2010, April 2010 and May 2010. After collecting the data
of two months, a gap is given for two month to observe the
variation and after that again data is colleted for another
two months. The purpose of this is to find out trend of
growth of webpages and inlinks.

Table 4 reveals that the LC has the highest WIF in all
the four months. It leads with an average WIF of 18.609
followed by GNL with 14.618, then NLNZ with 14.48, then
BL with 5.268, then NLC with 4.984, then NLI with 4.669,
and then NLA with 3.929, NLN with 2.156 and the last
rank is received by NLSA with 0.533.

6.1 Analyses of Web Links
These analyses require two types of data, i.e.,
number of webpages on each website and number of
inlinks on a website. In the given table, the data is
presented with respect to the month in which it is
collected (Table 2).

6.3 Information about Rich Files

The LC has the highest number of webpages during
the month of December and January but in the next two
months, i.e., April and May, the NLA has the maximum

The rich files constitute of files like portable document

Point (.ppt). These files represent the amount of published
information on a website. The complete, file type-wise
data regarding number of rich files of national libraries has
been displayed in the next table in a month-wise manner
(Table 5).

Figure 2 gives number of inlinks of websites of
national libraries. It shows that LC has the maximum
number of inlinks, i.e., 5747347.75 followed by NLA,
whereas NLN takes the last position with an average
number of 184.25 inlinks.

Month wise, NLA is at rank number one in all the four
months of data collection. LC takes the second rank in all
the four months, followed by British Library taken third
rank. National Library of Namibia which comes at the last
rank. The analyses of data reveal that the number of .pdf
files exceeds the number of .doc as well as .ppt files. Also
the numbers of .ppt files are not sufficient on almost all
the websites of national libraries covered under the study.

(ii) Web Impact Factor

7. FINDINGS
The major findings of the study are:
(i) Webpages and Inlinks
The rank list of websites of national libraries on the
basis of maximum number of webpages has been shown
in Fig. 1.
Figure 1 shows that on average, NLA hosts the
highest number of webpages on the web followed by LC
and BL. It is NLI India that hosts the lowest number of
webpages.
350

According to the data provided detailed calculation of
WIF is done and values are displayed in Fig. 3.
Figure 3 shows that LC rank number one in its impact
on the web with far more the number of inlinks as compare
to the number of webpages on its website. It leads with a
WIF of 18.609 followed by the GNL at the second position
with a WIF of 14.618 while National Library of Australia
(NLA) with a WIF of 3.929, comes at number seven,
though it stands number one in the rank list of webpages
and number two in the rank list of inlinks.
(iii) Rich Files
The rich text files constitute of files like .pdf, .doc,
.ppt. The rank list on the basis of rich files is shown in Fig.
4 that shows that NLA hosts the highest number of rich
files on its website, i.e., 27417.5 on an average followed
by LC with 12136.5 on an average. It is the website of NLN
which comes at the last in rank list with an average 4.75
files.

(a) The websites of some libraries like NLI and NLN
having minimum number of webpages, should go to a
deeper extent to make maximum number of its
webpages indexed by the search engines, so that it
becomes easier for the surfer to get access to the
information available on the website.
(b) In addition to providing maximum number of
documents, the libraries should also try to provide
information in different formats for the ease of the
users. None of website under study hosts an equal
number of types of files covered here.
(c) For receiving maximum number of hits from users
national libraries should increase the information on
their websites.

9. CONCLUSIONS
Website makes strong impact on the image of library,
information centre, and documentation centre. It is very
important when information providers are more concerned
about exploring its resources world wide like national
libraries. From the study, it can be concluded that LC is
more visible websites among the other websites selected.
The LC has the maximum number of WIF. The NLA ranked
in the first position with respect to number of webpages
among the various selected national libraries. The LC
leads all the libraries with maximum webpages in the first
two month than NLA hold the top position in the later two
months in the number of webpages. The LC had the
maximum number of inlinks, i.e., 5747347.75 followed by
NLA. The website of NLA holds the maximum number of
rich content files on its website.
