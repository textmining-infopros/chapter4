1. IntRoductIon 
The invention of agriculture is one of the great  revolution  of  human  history.  The  availability  of  nutritional adequacy of food have been driving forces  for human evolution and civilisation. People often lived  a  nomadic  life  as  hunters  and  gatherers  following  the migration of animals or moving during seasonal  changes  in  the  weather  prior  to  the  domestication  of plants and animals, some 12,000 years ago. The  adoption  of  agriculture,  and  the  domestication  of  plants  and  animals  reduced  the  nomadic  lifestyles  among  groups  of  people.  Communities  of  humans  grew larger. Eventually, as agriculture flourished and  produced larger food surpluses, these communities grew  into cities, that furthered the pursuit of government,  art  and  technology  for  which  human  civilisation  is  known1.  
Attaining food security had been the major policy  issue  for  the  entire  nation  since  independence.  Our  first  Prime  Minister,  Pandit  Jawaharlal  Nehru,  immediately  after  independence  had  accorded  the  highest importance to agriculture by stating “Everything  can  wait  but  not  agriculture”.  Prime  Minister  Lal  Bahadur Shastri had also accorded high importance  to  agriculturists    by  equating  them  with  defense  personnel,  through  the  slogan  as  ‘Jai  Jawan,  Jai  Kisan’. Recognising the contribution of  science for  the all round progress of our nation, Prime Minister  Atal Bihari Vajpayee further pronounced the slogan  as    ‘Jai  Jawan,  Jai  Kisan  and  Jai  Vigyan’.  He  also  gave  a  call  to  double  food  production  in  the  next  one  decade.  Owing  to  the  vision  of  all  our  great

leaders, India could achieve the required success in  agriculture. Over six decades since its independence,  India  has  made  immense  progress  towards  food  security. Indian population has tripled, but food-grain  production  more  than  quadrupled:  there  has  thus  been substantial increase in available food-grain per  capita. India has seen several agricultural revolutions  (Green, White, Yellow, Golden, Blue, etc.) resulting  major  advances  in  production  of  milk,  oilseeds,  fruits,  vegetables,  fish,  and  fish  products. 
The  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research  (ICAR)  is  an  autonomous  organisation  under  the  Department of Agricultural Research and Education  (DARE), Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India  formerly  known  as  Imperial  Council  of  Agricultural  Research. It was established on 16 July 1929 as a  registered  society  under  the  Societies  Registration  Act,  1860  in  pursuance  of  the  report  of  the  Royal  Commission  on  Agriculture.  Agriculture  research  in  India  was  entrusted  to  the  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 1966. At that time,  three national institutes, the IARI, the NDRI and the  IVRI  and  some  of  them  institutes  were  functionally  was  brought  under  ICAR. 
The ICAR has played a pioneering role in ushering  Green  Revolution  and  subsequent  developments  in  agriculture  in  India  through  its  research  and  technology development that has enabled the country  to  increase  the  production  of  food  grains  by  4  times, horticultural crops by 6 times, fish by 9 times  (marine  5  times  and  inland  17  times),  milk  6  times  and  eggs  27  times  since  1950-51,  thus  making  a

visible  impact  on  the  national  food  and  nutritional  security.  It  has  played  a  major  role  in  promoting  excellence  in  higher  education  in  agriculture.  The  ICAR  has  its  headquarters  at  New  Delhi.  The  Council  is  the  apex  body  for  coordinating,  guiding  and managing research and education in agriculture  including horticulture, fisheries and animal sciences  in the entire country. With 99 ICAR institutes and 53  agricultural  universities  spread  across  the  country  is  one  of  the  largest  national  agricultural  systems  in the world. It is engaged in cutting edge areas of  science and technology development and its scientists  are  internationally  acknowledged  in  their  fields2.

Nasir3, et al.  have carried out bibliometric analysis  of agricultural literature published in Malaysia during  1981-1990. The study highlighted on the key journals  that  published  agricultural  literature  by  Malaysian  authors and the publishing practice of corporate bodies. 
Arunachalan  &  umarani4   have  studied  11855  Indian agriculture publications during 1998-1999 and  the early months of 2000 using CAB database  and  identified top Indian institutions in different subfields,  different  journals  with  their    impact  factors. 
Garg5,  et  al.   analysed  16891  publications  by  Indian agricultural scientists during 1993-2002 using  Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science)  and  observed  that  the  publication  output  in  the  agricultural  sciences  is  on  the  decline  since  1998  onwards. 
Bartol6   has  assessed  the  characteristics  of  documents published in national journals and other  publications in the countries which participate on the  editorial  board  of  the Journal  of  Central  European  Agriculture(JCEA).  Bibliographic  citations  from  the  CAB  Abstracts   database  were  used.  The  study  found  out  that  Poland  is  the  major  contributor  of  documents, being by far the largest country. Altogether  some 378 different agricultural and related life- and  environmental science journals have been active in  the  region  during  the  study    period. 
Balasubramanian  &  Ravanan7   have  studied  the  global  agriculture  literature  and  highlighted  the  scientific  output  during  1945-2010  and  focused  on  the growth of literature, highly productive countries  and  most  preferred  journals.  Gupta8   analysed  the  ranking of India’s productive institutions in agricultural  sciences, based on the various qualitative indicators  during  1999-2008.  Borthakur  &  Singh9   attempted  to  portray  the  role  of  Five  Year  Plans  regarding  investment,  technology  transfer  and  other  aspects  related  to  agricultural  development  in  India.  
It  has  observed  that  although  agriculture  has  been playing the most vital role in Indian economy,  during  the  course  of  the  study  and  found  that  not  much  emphasis  has  been  given  to  the  history  of  evolution  of  agricultural  research  in  India. 
3.   o bjectIveS 
The  main  objective  of  the  study  is  to  present  the growth of agriculture research published during  1993-2012 as per the Web of Science  database and  make the quantitative and qualitative assessment by  way of analysing various features of research output  such as growth of publications and citations, domain- wise distribution of publications and citations, activity  index, domain-wise mean impact factor, international  collaboration,  highly  productive  institutions,  highly  preferred  journals  and  highly  cited  publications. 
4. MAteRIALS And  MethodS 
Data was collected from Web of Science for the  period  1993-2012.  It  is  very  difficult  to  define  the  scope of agriculture using keywords and combination  of keywords which may not always cover the entire  gamut  of  literature  on  agriculture  and  there  is  always every possibility of missing some percentage  of  literature.  Therefore,  it  was  decided  to  select  all  the  journals  on  agriculture  as  per  the  Journal  Citation  Reports  (JCR-2011)  subject  categories.  A  list  of  163  journals  falling  within  the  scope  of  agriculture  as  per  JCR  subject  categories  were  identified  and  the  articles  with  at  least  one  Indian  author  were  identified  by  using  country  affiliation  field. In all, 22615 Indian publications were retrived  during  the  period  (1993-2012)  and  98954  citations  received  to  these  publications  were  transferred  to  spread  sheet  application  and  analysed  the  data  as  per  objectives  of  the  study.  The  bibliographic  fields  were  analysed  by  normal  count  procedure  for continents, countries, domains, authorships and  journals.  Full  credit  was  given  to  each  continent,  country  regardless  of  whether  it  appears  first  or  last  in  the  author  byline.

5.1 Year-wise  distribution  of  Publications  and  
citations 
A total of 22615 publications were published in  agriculture during 1993-2012 and these publications  received  98954  citations.  Year-wise  distribution  of  publications  and  citations  is  given  in  Table  1  &  Fig.  1.  The  highest  number  of  publications  1917  (8.48  %)  were  published  in  2008.  The  highest  number of citations 8714 (8.81 %) were received in  2007. The highest average citations per publication  8.29  were  in  2002.  There  were  10428  (46.11  %)  publications with no citations during the period under  study.  The  highest  total  impact  factor  (1865.33)  was  in  2008.  The  highest  average  impact  factor  per  publications  (1.29)  was  in  2006.  The  highest  annual growth rate of publications was observed in  two  consecutive  years  2007  (42.08  %)  and  2008  (35.19 %). On considering ten year cumulative growth  of  publications  during  1993-2002  to  2003-2012,  a

5.4 Activity  Index  in Agriculture  Sub-domains 
The activity index (AI) characterises the relative  research  efforts  of  a  country  in  a  given  subject.  On analysing the growth and decline in publication  productivity  using  normalised  activity  index10-13,  it  was  observed  that  the  highest  activity  index  in  various  Agriculture  sub-domains  were:  Agricultural  Economics  &  Policy  (139.8  %)  during  2008-12,  Agricultural engineering (139.07 %) during 2008-12,  Agriculture-multidisciplinary (116.84 %) during 1993-97,  Agronomy  (121.7  %)  during  2008-12,  and  Dairy  &  animal  sciences  (119.87  %)  during  1998-02  (Fig.  2  and  Table  4).

5.5   v ariation  of  Mean  Impact  Factor  in  
Agriculture  Sub-domains 
Figure 3 gives the distribution of various agriculture  domains  according  to  mean  impact  factor  during  the  period  under  study.  It  is  revealed  from  this  analysis  that  there  is  a  significant  variation  in  mean  impact  factor  in  various  agriculture  science  domains. The highest mean impact factor (3.59) is for  agriculture engineering followed by Agronomy (1.37)  and  Agricultural  Economics  &  Policy  (1.35).  5.6 International collaboration 
In recent years, every country has realised the  importance of collaborative research to tackle many  scientific  problems  resulting  in  many  international  collaborations14. Table 5 and Fig. 4 provide international  collaboration pattern with Indian institutions in agriculture  research. Indian Institutions had the highest number  of  collaborative  publications  with  countries  like  the  uSA,  Australia,  Germany,  England,  Philippines,  Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, Netherlands, France,  and  South  Korea. 
5.7 International  collaborative  Publications  in  
Agriculture  Sub-domains 
The International collaboration trend in various  sub-domains  is  given  in  Table  6.  Out  of  22615  publications, there were 1744 (7.71 %) publications  were  international  collaborative  publications  with  104  countries.  Indian  scientists  had  highest  (480)  international collaborative publications scientists with uSA  followed  by  Australia  with  158  publications,

5.9 Specialisation  Index 
Specialisation index (SI) is the relationship between  a  country’s  share  of  global  publications  for  a  field  of research and its world share of publications in all  disciplines.  If  they  are  higher  than  1  that  indicates  subjects in which research is especially active, and  thus  supported  as  priorities  by  the  research  policy  decision-makers. Conversely, an index of less than 1  indicates the non priority area15. The institutes having  ≥40  publications  considered  for  this  analysis.
