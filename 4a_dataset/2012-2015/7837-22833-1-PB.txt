In this study an attempt has been made to study the newspaper reading habits among post- 
graduate students of Karnatak University, Dharwad. 
Keywords: Newspaper reading habits, news seeking, newspapers, information seeking 
1. INtRoDUctIoN 
When we think of newspapers, we think of them  as  bringing  us  news,  when  we  think  of  news  we  think of what’s happening currently around us. This  is  a  totally  inadequate  description  of  news  as  well  as  newspapers. A  newspaper  is  not  only  a  source  of  information,  it’s  a  storehouse  of  information.  Reading  newspaper  daily  is  one  of  the  best  ways  to  keep  up  to  date  with  the  ever  advancing  world.  All  the  important  news  and  events  of  the  world  are  brought  to  our  doorstep  by  the  newspapers.  Newspapers  bring  us  a  selection  of  the  news  from  around  the  world.  There  is  news  from  the  parliament  which  provides  information  with  regard  to  decisions  affecting  the  country.  News  from  the  world comes through reporters for local newspapers  stations abroad or through news agencies in different  countries. Newspapers can also act as a forum for  the  readers  and  writers  to  express  their  ideas  and  views on various aspects. Thus reading newspapers  is essential for young learners to be more responsive  and  enlightened  citizens.  But  unfortunately,  many  students  of  our  country  do  not  have  easy  access  to newspapers. Modern societies rely on the media  of  which  newspapers  are  an  important  component  to  disseminate  current  and  vital  information.

FINDINGS AND   S UGGeStIoNS 
It  is  found  that  majority  of  the  students  i.e.,  97.95  %  read  Kannada  newspapers  and  most  of  them (65.51 %) read newspapers at hostels. 65.31 %  students spend less than an hour a day for reading  newspaper and only 2 students spend more than 2  hours.  44.90  %  of  students  are  self  subscribers  of  the  newspapers  and  the  number  of  students  who  access to the newspapers in library is marginal i.e.,  18.37  %.

On  data  analysis  and  opinion  given  by  the  respondents, some important suggestions have been  made,  which  will  help  in  promoting  the  newspaper  reading  habits  among  P.G.  students  of  Karnatak  University  Dharwad. 
(a) University  library  should  increase  subscription  
of  the  newspapers  and  inspire  the  students  to  
make use of newspapers in the library through  
user  education  programmes. 
(b) The awareness about the importance of newspaper  
reading and about sections of newspapers must  
be created among P.G. students which will help  
them  to  keep  update  with  current  happenings  
around  the  world. 
(c) Awareness  has  to  be  created  on  the  use  of  
online newspapers, which may ultimately helps  
for  the  cause  of  environmental  protection.  (d) With  so  many  news  portals  available  online,  
students must be encouraged to prefer news portals  
for  getting  instant  news  of  their  interest. 
28 
(e) Majority of the students are not aware of news  
portals. Therefore  libraries  should  promote  the  
use  of  different  news  portals  among  library  
users by creating awareness through orientation  
programmes. 
6.  coNcl USIoNS 
As it is well known that, reading is an important  activity in the process of learning, which can shape  good  personality,  ideas,  right  thinking  and  brings  change  in  attitude  of  individuals.  News  papers  particularly  are  the  prime  conveyors  of  current  information to the people. In spite of the availability of  several other sources of news like books, magazines  (Print media), radio, television channels, telephone,  electronic media, etc. yet newspapers continued to  dominate as the main channel of current information.  Newspapers not only provide current news, they also  contain  thought-provoking  and  informative  articles,  features,  editorial  and  sub-editorials,  analysis  and  observations.  In  today’s  highly  competitive  world,  newspapers  can  equip  students  with  necessary  information, knowledge and insights which will give  them the much needed edge for being successful not  only for competitive examinations or job interviews,  but also in their professional and social life. Therefore,  newspapers  are  essential  for  university  students.  
This study reveals that most of the P.G. students  are in the habit of reading newspapers but still they  are not aware of the advantage of online newspapers  and  news  portals  which  can  spontaneously  update  their  knowledge  by  providing  latest  and  nascent  information. Therefore, the library professionals must  create  more  awareness  of  such  news  sources  and  libraries must ensure that the students have access  to wide variety of newspapers, so as to enable the  students  to  read  their  preferred  newspapers  and  enhance their knowledge base which can help them  to  be  more  productive  in  their  academics  and  lead  a  responsible  life  in  the  society.
