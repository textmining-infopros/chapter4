ABSTRACT 
An analysis of letters published by top 10 publishing countries in journals indexed by Science Citation  Index Expanded (SCIE) during 1987-89, 1997-99 and 2007-09 indicates that the letters published by  developed countries including China have declined as proportion of their total output. The number of  letters published by Indian scientists has remained constant during the three blocks. These letters were  scattered in a large number of journals published from advanced countries of the world and India. The  letters came from more than 1000 institutions located in different parts of the country. The highest number  of letters was published in the discipline of medicine and the letters published in the ﬁ  eld of chemistry  
had the highest Relative Citation Impact (RCI).  
1. INTRODUCTION 
‘Letter to the Editor’ (here after mentioned as letter)  is an important vehicle of scientific communication1.  The importance given to this column is shared by  several prominent medical and non-medical journals.  In the past, several journals have started publishing  letter type publications like Journal of Material  Science Letters,  Journal of Physical Chemistry  Letters, FEBS Letters,  etc. ‘Letter to the editor’ is  generally of two types,  namely, one that reports  the original findings and the other that reports the  response to some previous publications. 
2. OBJECTIVES 
Following are the objectives of the present  study: 
•  To study the publication pattern of letters by  
ten top publishing countries, namely, USA, UK,  
Japan, France, Canada, Italy, Australia, the  
Netherlands, Spain, and China  
•  To identify publishing country of journals where  
Indian scientists publish letters 
•  To identify most preferred journals used by  
Indian scientists for publishing letters 
•  To identify publishing institutions 
•  To identify the disciplines of the published  
letters 
•  To study the impact of these letters by analysing  
citations received by them.

3. DATA AND METHODOLOGY 
The data for the present communication consists  of the letters published by Indian scientists in journals  indexed by Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE)  in three different block years i.e. 1987-89, 1997-99  and 2007-09. Bibliometric data elements that were  downloaded include the subject of the letter, affiliation  of the author, name of the journal in which the  letter appeared, and the citations received by each  letter. In addition to the above, data of letters for  top 10 publishing countries were also downloaded  to examine the change in the publication pattern of  letters for different countries. The data was analysed  to study the stated objectives.  
4. RESULTS 
During three different block years, i.e., 1987-89,  1997-99 and 2007-09, Indian scientists published  7091 letters. Of these, 40 letters were published  in Nature, 15 in Science, and 6 in Proceeding of  the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. The  number of letters published in these three journals  varied for different blocks. Remaining 7030 letters  were published in 948 journals published from  developed and developing countries including India.  These letters received 14,744 citations in all. The  detailed analysis of the results of the study is as  follows.

1997-99 and 2007-09) in gap of 10 years. It indicates  that the total output of papers has increased for  all countries, but the share of letters of the total  output has decreased for all countries, except for  India. The decrease is very significant in case of  China. In case of China, the proportion of letters  was 4  per cent of the total output in the block  year 1987-89, while in the last block 2007-09 the  same has gone down to 0.4 per cent, a decrease  of ten times. In case of all other countries, the  decrease is about 50 per cent except for Italy and  the Netherlands. In case of these two countries, the  decline is not that high. However, in case of India,  the proportion of letters remained almost constant  during all the three periods. Possible reason for  this decline may be that developed countries don’t  consider ‘letters’ as an indicator for evaluation i.e.  it does not add as a paper in their biodata. Also,  in recent times lot of information exchange and  discussion is taking place in the cyber world, which  can be another reason for this decline. ‘Letters’ are  a part of post-publication review process and hence  their decline may affect this process. 
4.2 Journal Publishing Country of Letters 
Indian scientists published letters in 951 journals  published from 39 different countries including India.  Table 2 shows the distribution of letters published  in journals from top 6 countries including India.It  indicates that highest proportion of letters appeared  in journals are published from USA, followed by  India and UK. The proportion of letters published in  US journals remained almost constant during all the  three blocks; however, the share of letters appeared  in journals published from UK, the Netherlands,  Switzerland, and Germany decreased in 2007-09 as  compared to 1987-89 and 1997-99. The proportion  
74 
of letters published in Indian journals increased  significantly in the last two blocks as compared  to the first block. One of the probable reasons for  the increase in letters in Indian journals may be  due to the inclusion of more Indian journals in the  SCIE  database in later periods.  
4.3 Publishing Institutions 
Total number of letters published by the Indian  scientists during these three blocks was contributed  by authors from 1690 institutions located in different  parts of the country and 135 letters were published  by individuals having no institutional affiliation. Table  3 lists 31 most prolific institutions that published  0.5 per cent or more of the letters. Most of the  institutions listed in Table 3 were either medical  colleges or hospitals. Citation impact of these  letters was examined by using Relative Citation  Impact (RCI) developed by Institute of Scientific  Information (now Thomson Reuters, USA) and  has been used by Kumari2  to study the impact of  different countries in the field of synthetic organic  chemistry research.  
The RCI measures both the influence and  visibility of different countries research output in  global perspective.  
RCI = (A country’s share of world citations)/(Country’s  
  share of world publications); 
RCI=1 indicates that country’s citation rate is equal  
 to world citation rate;  
RCI>1 indicates that country’s citation rate is higher  
than world’s citation rate; and  
RCI < 1 indicates that country’s citation rate is less  
  than world’s citation rate.  
In the present case country has been replaced  by institutions. Among the 31 institutions listed in  Table 3 only 9 institutions had RCI ≥  1. The value  of RCI for Seth G.S. Medical College and KEM  Hospital was = 1. For the remaining 21 institutions,  it was < 1. This indicates that the impact of the  letters published by these institutions was less than  the overall impact of letters published by Indian  scientists. Letters published by Indian Institute of  Technology, Madras had the highest impact as  judged by the value of RCI. It was followed by Indian  Institute of Technology, Bombay and Indian Institute  of Science, Bangalore. These institutes have high  values of RCI because some of their letters have  been cited more than 100 times. The impact of  the letters made by Indian Institute of Technology,  Kanpur, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata,  and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research were  almost equal. The impact made by letters published  by medical institutions was low as compared to  other institutions listed in Table 3.

*Percentage is more than 100 as many journals were classiﬁ  ed in  more than one category. 
These 7091 letters were published in 11 different  disciplines. Table 4 presents the distribution of these  letters in different disciplines. 63.2 per cent of the  letters was published in the discipline of medicine. It  was followed by letters in multidisciplinary sciences  and physics. The share of letters in these three  disciplines was almost 87 per cent of all published  letters. To identify the discipline of highest impact  authors made use of RCI described above. The  values of RCI for different disciplines indicate that  the letters published in the discipline of chemistry  made the highest impact followed by letters in the  discipline of physics and material science. Letters  published in the field of medicine and multidisciplinary  sciences were having a very low impact. Mathematics  and agriculture are low impact fields, but the letters  published in both these disciplines were having  higher impact than medicine, which is a high impact  field. 
4.5 Most Preferred Journals and their Impact 
Table 5 lists most preferred journals where  Indian scientists published their letters. Of the most  preferred 24 journals, 11 were Indian journals and  the rest were published from USA (5), UK (6), the  Netherlands (1) and Ireland (1). Citation impact of  these letters was examined by using RCI.  
Of all the letters published in these 24 journals,  the letters published in five journals had made more  impact than the overall impact of letters published  by Indian scientists. The letters published in Journal  of Physics A–Mathematical and General  made the  highest impact followed by Astrophysics and Space  
76 
Science. This indicates that letters published in  the field of physics made more impact than in  medicine.  
4.6 Pattern of Citation of Letters 
Citation is an indicator of influence and visibility.  Of the total 7091 letters published by Indian scientists  during the three different blocks (1987-89, 1997-99,  and 2007-09), about 60 per cent remained uncited.  However, the proportion of uncited letters varied  during different periods (Table 6). For instance,  the proportion of uncited letters was highest for  the block year 2007-09 and lowest for the block  year 1987-89. One of the possible reasons for  high proportion of uncited letters for the last block  may be a shorter citation window as compared to  other blocks. The proportion of uncited letters will  decrease as the citation window will increase. Table  6 shows the pattern of citations for three different  blocks. Appendix lists letters that received 70 or  more citations. 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
The study indicates that the total output of  papers has increased for all the countries, but the  share of letters of the total output has decreased  for all countries, except for India. The decrease is  very significant in case of China. 
The letters published by Indian scientists appeared  in 951 journals published from 39 different countries  including India and the highest proportion of letters  was in journals published from USA, followed by  India and UK. 
Letters published by Indian Institute of Technology,  Madras had the highest impact as judged by the  value of RCI. It was followed by Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay and Indian Institute of Science,  Bangalore.  
Almost two-third of the letters was published  in the discipline of medicine followed by letters  in multidisciplinary sciences and physics. Letters  published in the discipline of chemistry made the  highest impact. 
About 60 per cent letters remained uncited.  However, the proportion of uncited letters varied  during different periods. Of all the letters published in  most commonly used 24 journals, letters published in  only five journals had more impact than the overall  impact of letters published by Indian scientists.
