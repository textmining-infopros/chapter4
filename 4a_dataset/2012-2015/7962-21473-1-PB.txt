The  study  examined  the  demographic  variables  as  correlates  of  lecturers  research  productivity  in Faculties of Law in Nigerian universities. The descriptive survey research design was adopted. The  multistage sampling technique was used to select 414 out of 905 lecturers from 16 faculties of Law in 29  federal and state universities across the 6 geo-political zones of Nigeria. A questionnaire was used. Three  research questions were answered and one hypothesis was tested at 0.05 level of signifcance. Data were  analysed using descriptive statistics, Pearson product moment correlation and multiple regression. Based  on multiple regression analysis the result shows that demographic variables such as age, designation, and  years of experience have signifcant positive relationship with research productivity of  law lecturers.

1. INtRoDUCtIoN 
Universities  across  the  world  are  considered  as  producers  of  new  knowledge  through  research.  Hence,  the  nature  of  academics  is  not  limited  to  teaching. According to Marsh and Hattie1, the major  responsibilities  of  academic  staff  (law  lecturers)  in  the  universities  are  teaching  (transmission  of  knowledge), research (advancement of knowledge),  and  community  service  (application  of  knowledge).  In  their  research  duties,  lecturers  are  expected  to  create new knowledge, re-order and repackage old  relevant knowledge for the benefit of the community.  Thus,  research  productivity  shapes  the  ability  of  lecturers  to  meet  the  challenges  of  a  dynamic  and  even  complex  environment2. 
Most  of  the  research  work  in  Nigeria  occurs  in  universities. Indeed, research production has become  essential  for  the  success  of  universities  and  the  prospects  of  promotion  for  academics3,4.  
Several variables have been linked with research  productivity.  Earlier  studies  primarily  focused  on  analysing the association of productivity with variables  such  as  institutional  size,  academic  status,  age,  gender, and others. Many studies have incorporated  psychological and other latent variables in analysing  productivity. There are however demographic variables  (such  as  age,  gender,  qualification,  rank,  years  of  experience  and  year  of  promotion)  that  tend  to  
intervene  between  the  quest  for  information  and  accessibility to relevant information available to law  lecturers. At the individual level, demographic variables  intervene between the acquisition of information and  its  use5.  Beyond  these  demographic  variables  are  the  availability,  accessibility  and  utilisation  of  legal  information resources. These variables could affect  the research productivity of law lecturers. Thus, for  information  to  be  accessed  and  utilised  efficiently  and effectively, some demographic variables become  relevant6. 
2. AIM 
The study tried to answer the following research  questions: 
(a) What  are  the  demographic  variables  (such  
as  gender,  age,  designation,  and  educational  
qualification)  of  law  lecturers?    
(b) What  is  the  level  of  research  productivity  
of  lecturers  in  Faculties  of  law  in  Nigerian  
universities?;  and  
(c) What are the demographic variables that influence  
research  productivity  of  lecturers  in  Faculties  
of  law  in  Nigerian  universities?. 
Hypothesis 
There  is  no  significant  relationship  between  demographic variables and research productivity of

lecturers in Faculties of law in Nigerian universities. The  hypothesis  was  tested  at  0.05  level  of  significance. 
3.  LI tERAtURE  REVIEW 
Demographic  factors  relate  to  the  personal  characteristics of academic members. Demographic  variables  such  as  age,  gender,  marital  status  and  academic rank have been associated with research  productivity. Age has been studied in numerous works,  with  conflicting  results.  The  literature  on  age  and  research  productivity  using  different  measures  for  age (chronological, years of professional experience  and  years  since  the  receipt  of  PhD  degree)  posits  that  young  researchers  made  more  outstanding  contributions  to  knowledge  than  older  ones.  Many  studies  about  productivity  have  indicated  that  the  relationship  between  career  publication  and  age  is  not  linear,  although  the  overall  rate  of  publication  generally declines with age. Teodorescu7  investigated  faculty publication across 10 countries and discovered  that age significantly influences research productivity  in the US. While Kotrlik8, et al.,   in  a  study  using  a  random  sampling  of  228  colleges  and  universities  academic  members  in  the  US  found  that  age  does  not  significantly  affect  research.  There  is  relation  between  age  and  productivity  and  this  connection  holds for both men and women. High age is negatively  related  to  productivity  for  both  men  and  women.  Women  are  more  productive  in  the  age  group  50-54,  while  men  are  more  productive  in  the  age  group  45-497. 
Also significant for most groups (excluding tenured  women)  is  the  effect  of  rank,  with  faculty  at  higher  ranks reporting higher levels of research productivity.  However, Williams9, et al.,  did not find ranks to be a  significant decider of research productivity. Professors  are more productive than associate professors, and  since  there  are  fewer  women  in  senior  positions,  the  difference  in  productivity  between  ranks  has  consequences for average productivity between male  and  female  researchers.  Tower10,   et  al.   reached  the same conclusions in a more recent large scale  study  of  Australian  academics.  Bassey11,  et  al., noted  that  research  productivity  increases  social  prestige  of  the  academic  staff  status  to  the  rank  of  a  professor  irrespective  of  his  or  her  gender.  Certain studies have confirmed that academic staff  at  the  higher  ladder  of  the  professional  rank  has  larger  publications  than  those  in  the  lower  rank.  Yousef & Jaleh12  found out that academic rank and  age  are  significant  predictors  for  faculty  members’  research productivity in Iran. Academic rank, doctorate  qualifications, research time and international research  collaboration  were  the  strongest  factors  positively  associated with publication productivity, but women  typically reported significantly lower levels on each  of  these  factors13.

The  literature  revealed  that  some  previous  studies  have  found  that  demographic  variables  of  lecturers  could  be  measured  over  a  period  of  time  in  respect  to  research  productivity.  However,  it  is  clear that much research has not been done on the  extent  to  which  demographic  variables  of  lecturers  in the Faculties of law in Nigerian universities could  influence  their  research  productivity.  Thus,  this  work  is  necessary  to  fill  the  gap  and  to  provide  a  reference  point  for  future  studies.

The  descriptive  survey  research  design  was  adopted.  The  multistage  sampling  technique  was  used  to  select  414  out  of  905  lecturers  from  16  Faculties of law in 29 federal and state universities  across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria, namely,  North Central, North East, North West, South East,  South  West  and  South  South14.  
A  questionnaire  was  used  to  collect  data.  The  research questions were analysed using descriptive  statistics,  such  as  mean,  standard  deviations  and  variance,  while  the  hypothesis  was  tested  with  Pearson  correlation  coefficient  and  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  at  0.05  level  of  significance.

Qualification,  Rank,  Experience)  of  Law  
Lecturers 
From the 16 universities studied, male respondents  were  352  (85.0  %)  and  female  62  (14.9  %).  Given  that  the  distribution  of  the  questionnaire  at  each  university  was  done  by  total  enumeration,  the  results  indicated  that  more  males  were  employed  as lecturers in Law faculties in Nigerian universities  (Table  1).

For the age distribution of respondents, majority  (62.5 %) of the respondents are within the 40-49 age  brackets.  This  result  showed  that  the  respondents  were  within  their  active  academic  years.  The  educational  qualification  of  lecturers  under  this  study  was  quite  varied.  PhD,  Masters  (LLM),  and  Bachelor  degree  (LLB)  were  used  to  measure  the  level  of  educational  qualification  of  respondents.  Across the universities, the ratio of Masters degree  (LLM)  holders  were  higher  than  other  educational  qualifications.  Masters  degree  holders  represent 89.1 % of the respondents while PhD and Bachelor degree  holders  represent  7.2  %  and  3.6  %  respectively. 
There  were  more  respondents  in  the  lecturer  Grade 11 category (140 representing 33.8 %) followed  by  senior  lecturers  and  assistant  lecturers  with  response  rate  of  99  (23.9  %)  and  83  (20.0  %)  respectively. While lecturer I and Professor / Associate  Professor had a response rate of 81 (19.5 %) and 11 (2.6  %)  respectively.  
5.2 Research Productivity  of Lecturers  in  
Faculties  of Law  in  Nigerian Universities 
Research  productivity,  refers  to  the  output  published in chapters in books, co-authored textbooks,  occasional papers, monographs, conference papers,  articles in learned journals, and international peer- reviewed journals.  To determine the level of research  productivity  of  the  respondents  within  the  period  of  3  years  (2009-2011),  average  score  of  their  productivity  was  computed  (Table  2).  The  result  shows that 258 (62.3%) respondents had articles in  learned  journals.  This  result  strongly  confirms  the

culture of publish or perish that is a popular cliché  among  academics  in  Nigerian  university  settings.  162    (39.1%)  had  conference  proceedings.  Also,  182  (43.9%)  respondents  had  chapters  in  books.  
In  Nigeria,  university  regulations  state  that  academic  staff  members  are  to  be  evaluated  for  promotion  every  three  years.  Thus,  the  analysis  establishes  the  fact  that  the  research  productivity  of  the  lecturers  in  Faculties  of  law  in  Nigerian  universities is higher in journal publications, chapters  in  books  and  conference  proceedings.  However,  the  research  productivity  of  lecturers  in  Faculties  of  law  in  Nigerian  universities  is  low  in  textbook  publications,  monographs,  co-authored  books  and  occasional  paper  (Table  2). 
5.3  Relationship  between  Demographic  
Variables  and  Research  Productivity  of  
Lecturers 
Research  productivity  of  law  lecturers  were  measured in terms of textbook publication, chapters in  books, co-authoured books, monographs, occasional  papers,  articles  in  learned  journals,  conference  proceedings and international peer-reviewed journals  in  view  of  their  demographic  variables.  To  test  the  relationship between each variable and law lecturers  research  productivity,  a  sum  of  the  mean  scores  of  each  of  the  components  of  the  demographic  variables  was  computed  and  correlated  with  the  items  in  research  productivity.

Table 8 indicates that there is significant positive  correlation between research productivity of lecturers  from the Faculties of Law in Nigerian universities and  that age (r=0.81), years of experience (r=0.65), geo- political zones (r=0.18), and ownership of university  (r=0.39) significantly correlated positively with research  productivity, while gender (r=-0.44) and educational  qualification  (r=-0.12)  had  negative  but  significant  correlations. It is also indicated that age (r=0.81), years  of experience (r=0.65), geo-political zones (r=0.18),  and  ownership  of  university  (r=0.39)  significantly  correlated positively with research productivity, while

gender (r= -0.44) and educational qualification (r= -  0.12) had negative but significant correlations. This  finding  disagrees  with  some  studies  that  revealed  that  there  was  no  difference  in  productivity  as  a  result of gender7-9. However, the study agrees with  Teodorescu7  investigated faculty publication across  10  countries  and  discovered  that  age  significantly  influences  research  productivity  in  the  US.  
There existed significant relationship with research  productivity and designation of lecturers (r =0.027, p  
> .05). The findings agreed with the study of Yousef  
8. 
&  Jaleh12   who  found  out  that  academic  rank  and  age  are  significant  predictors  for  faculty  members’  research productivity in Iran. However, Williams,9 et  al.   did  not  find  ranks  to  be  a  significant  decider  of  research  productivity.  This  study  shows  that  there  is  relationship  between  research  productivity  of   lecturers and their level of educational qualification  (r=0.011,  p  >0.05).  It  also  shows  that  years  of  experience  is  significantly  related  with  the  level  of  research  productivity  of  the  respondents  (r=0.114,  p>0.05).  This  shows  that,  the  higher  the  years  of  experience,  the  higher  the  level  of  research  productivity  of  the  respondents.
