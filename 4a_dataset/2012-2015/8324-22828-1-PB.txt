In this paper attempt has been made to identify the uncited publications in ‘micro-electro mechanical  systems  (MEMS)  literature  which  is  one  of  the  emerging  feld  in  electronics. The  search  term  ‘MEMS’  was used for retrieving literatures from SCOPUS database. A total of 294573 records were identifed in  the  feld  of  MEMS  during  the  period  1970-2013.  Out  of  which,  85146  (28.90  %)  records  were  uncited  publications. The  uncited  paper  ranges  between  0.09  %  and  0.72  %.  It  can  be  seen  that  from  1988  onwards uncitedness has been reduced below the global average and it persists till 2010. Almost 56 %  of the uncited publications are from the conference proceedings. 44.56% of China publications in MEMS  were uncited followed by India (31.44 %), Japan (24.40 %), and France (19.44 %). Majority of the uncited  publications, are of collaborative authors besides the self-citations. Mostly more than four authors’ papers  were uncited.  Even top author papers were also uncited. The uncitedness may be due to non-awareness  
of those papers in the MEMS literature.

1.  INtrODUctION 
Over  the  past  three  decades,  citation  analysis  along with peer review has been increasingly used  to  judge  and  quantify  the  importance  of  scientists  and  scientific  research.  Citation  analysis  is  also  used  as  the  mean  behind  journal  impact  factors.  Indeed, the output from citation studies is often the  only  way  that  un-specialists  in  governments  and  funding  bodies–or  even  those  in  different  scientific  disciplines–can  judge  the  importance  of  a  piece  of  scientific  research.  These  studies  focused  on  the  scientific  output  and  impact  of  the  research  output  published  during  different  periods.In  the  past,  several  authors  have  examined  the  issue  of  uncitedness  of  journals  as  well  as  the  subject  specific  disciplines.  The  studies  on  uncitedness  of  journals—Journal  of  American  Chemical  Society

index  database–ISI5;  country-wise5-6   are  the  few. However, till date no study has been examined the  uncitedness of a particular field or domain indexed  by  SCI-E  or  SCOPUS  database.  Therefore,  an  attempt has been made to identify the uncitedness  in  the  field  of  MEMS  (micro-electro  mechanical  systems). 
1.1  Micro-Electro  Mechanical  Systems 
The  term  ‘micro-electro  mechanical  systems  (MEMS)’ one of the emerging filed in electronics, has  been first included in the project proposal submitted  to  DARPA  in  1986.  Since  then  it  has  good  impact  on global economy for incorporating this techniques  in  mico  system-based  devices  as  tiny  integrated  product or the combination of both mechanical and  electrical  components.  Integrated  circuit  (IC)  has  been  used  to  fabricate  the  devices  using  these  
Nature2;  subject-specific  disciplines—Library  and  
techniques and it ranges from millimeters to micro- 
information science3,  physics,  chemistry,  biological  sciences, geosciences, engineering and medicine4;  
millimeters. The main aim is to reduce not only the  size  of  the  system  but  also  to  reduce  significantly

the energy and material requirements which results  in  cost/performance  advantage. These  devices  are  possible  to  be  embedded  in  a  small  area.  
The  MEMS,  a  combination  of  silicon-based  microelectronics  and  micromachining  technology,  is  an  interdisciplinary  nature  used  in  areas  like  design,  engineering  and  manufacturing  products.  It  utilises  expertise  from  a  wide  and  diverse  range  of  technical  areas  including  IC  technology,  IC  fabrication  technology,  mechanical  engineering,  electrical  and  material  engineering,  chemistry  and  chemical  engineering,  fluid  engineering,  optics,  instrumentation and packaging. It is used to develop  very  small  devices  called  to  be  in  nano-scale.  Today,  MEMS  emerged  as  a  field  in  the  modern  technological era because of its impact in computer  technology, mechanical engineering, manufacturing,  production,  and  medical  instrumentation.

7 identified that 6231 (17.5%) out  of  35,640  Indian  scientist  papers  published  during  the period 2008-2013 remained uncited. Most of the  uncited papers were published by State Agricultural  Universities  and  the  Indian  Council  of  Agricultural  Research. The highest proportion of uncited papers  was  in  the  area  of  agricultural  sciences  followed  by multidisciplinary and mathematical sciences. The  Evidence  report  of  Thomson  Reuters  has  shown  that  there  is  a  decrease  in  the  percentage  of  papers  emanating  from  India  which  do  not  receive  citations8. High share of uncited publications, which  
• included  those  produced  by  top  scientists,  was  repeatedly  reported  to  exceed  10  %  of  the  total  papers  produced.  
Petr  Heneberg9   analysed  the  uncitedness  among  two  independent  groups  of  highly  visible  mathematicians  represented  by  field  medalists,  researchers  in  physiology  or  medicine  represented  by Nobel Prize laureates. Over 90 % of the uncited  database  records  of  highly  visible  scientists  have  been presented in progress reports, meeting abstracts,  letters to the editor, discussion, personalia by errors  of omission and commission of the Web of Science  (WoS) database and of the citing documents. Only  0.9  and  0.3  %,  of  original  articles  and  reviews  were found to be uncited.Uncitable documents were  responsible  for  up  to  30%  of  the  total  citations  to  the  top-tier  journals,  with  the  highest  values  found  for  medical  science  journals  (New  England  Journal of Medicine, JAMA, and  Lancet)  and lower  values found for the science, nature, and cellseries

3.1    Hypotheses                                                    
Based on the objectives, the following hypotheses  were  framed: 
• There exist considerable amount uncited publications  
exist  in  MEMS  literature  output.  
• There is a substantial amount of uncited publications  
from the countries that has contributed to MEMS  
literature.  
• The conference papers are the major contribution  
for  the  uncited  literature. 
• There exist uncited among the top cited authors  
publications.  
There  is  no  significant  difference  in  authorship  
pattern  for  uncited  publications.  
4.    MEtHODOLOGY 
For  this  study,  literature  on  MEMS  was  downloaded  from  online  multidiscipline  database  SCOPUS, an international indexing and abstracting  database  using  the  search  term  ‘MEMS’.  A  total  of  294573  records  were  identified  in  the  field  of  MEMS  worldwide  for  the  period  1970-2013.  Out  of  which,  85146  (28.90  %)  records  were  identified  as  uncited  publications.  
The  data  have  been  classified  by  using  Excel  and  the  same  been  loaded  into  SPSS  (statistical  package  for  social  sciences)  for  the  purpose  of  statistical analysis. Statistical tools such as frequency  distribution and percentage analysis and bibliometric  techniques  such  as  relative  growth  rate,  doubling  time,  citation  analysis  were  used.

5.2   ratio  of  Uncited  Publications  (Year-wise) 
Year-wise  distributions  of  uncited  publications  were identified from the collected data. The ratio of  growth  has  been  calculated  between  the  cited  and  uncited publications. The year-wise distribution (Table  2)  contains  total  publications,  cited  publications,  uncited publications, percentage of uncited, cumulative  uncited, percentage of cumulative uncited publications,

It is seen from Table 2 that the uncited publications  
are  in  the  rising  side  and  every  year  it  is  getting  
increased. In 2013, approx. 15 % of the publications  
were uncited. Figures 1-3 show the raising trend of  
uncited publications.To visualise clearly, a two way  
trend line has been drawn (downward line indicates  
linear trend and arrow head line) and also a global  
uncited  average  has  been  indicated  in  doted.  The  
uncited  papers  range  between  0.09  and  0.72.  The  
Figure 2. Year-wise cited Vs uncited publications. importance  of  cited  has  been  realised  from  the  
beginning  of  1970  onwards.  It  can  be  seen  that  
from  1988  onwards  uncitedness  has  been  reduced  
below  the  global  average  and  it  persists  till  2010.  
The  piling  of  uncited  literature  is  to  be  dealt  with  
carefully  and  uncited  articles  are  to  be  projected  
or  brought  to  the  attention  of  researchers.  
The  study  has  further  been  extended  to  block  
year-wise  to  identify  the  block  period  in  which  the  
raise  of  uncitedness  were  more.  The  entire  study  
period has been divided in eleven-years block. Table  
Figure 3. ratio of uncited and total publications. 3  shows  that  between  the  block  years  2003-2013,  
73.31 % (62419) publications are uncited which gives  
uncited  publications  are  from  Germany  (14.62  %)  an alarm to the researchers that they could not cite  
(Fig.  6).  The  study  has  further  been  extended  to  or refer the required papers for their research. The

D.C. has the least uncited publications (4 out of 34  publications) who ranks first in uncited publications.  It  may  be  clear  that  even  highly  produced  authors  publications  may  also  go  uncited.  
6.  FINDINGS 
Some  of  the  findings  derived  are: 
• Uncited  publications  in  the  beginning  of  the  
publication are more. The growth of the publications  
over  the  year  results  in  reduction  in  uncited  
publications.  
• An  average  of  29  %  of  the  publications  goes  
uncited in the MEMS literature during the study  
period  of  1970  to  2013.  
• There  is  a  drastic  reduction  in  uncited  papers  
during  the  period  of  1990  to  2010. 
• Though there is an increase in uncited publications

from  the  conference  proceedings.  It  may  not  
surprise  if  other  form  of  publications  such  as  
letters,  review  papers,  erratum,  etc.  
• 44.56  %  of  China  publications  in  MEMS  were  
uncited. It is followed by India (31.44%), Japan  
(24.40  %)  and  France  (19.44  %). 
•      Majority of uncited publications, besides the self  
citations,  are  of  collaborative  authors.  Mostly  
more  than  four  authors’  papers  were  uncited.  
Even  top  author  papers  were  also  uncited. 
7.    SUGGEStIONS 
Davis13,14 indicated citation errors, citation takes  time and citation is limited by the universe of indexed  papers  are  the  three  primary  reasons  behind  this  uncited articles. The policy of the citation databases  is  also  one  of  the  primary  reasons  of  uncitedness.  Few  are  discussed  as  follows: 
• Citation errors - Authors misspell journal names  
or  errors  in  the  volume  or  page  numbers.  To  
overcome  this  error  DOIs  and  disambiguation  
software at the indexing stage can help correct  
well-intentioned  mistakes,  they  still  take  place.  
Errors  prevent  a  directional  link  to  be  made  
from the citing article to the cited article, which  
means  that  it  cannot  be  counted.  Counting  
assumes  good  metadata. 
• Citation takes time. An article may wait years for

The scientists and researchers are on the  same  line  to  utilise  these  results  and  make  to  find  new  things  for  their  new  inventions.
