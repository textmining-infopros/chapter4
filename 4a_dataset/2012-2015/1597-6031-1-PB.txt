ABSTRACT
This paper analyses the literature of classification published during 2000 to 2009 and finds that there is
sustainability in the growth of literature on classification in the first decade of the 21st century. It traces the pattern
in scattering of literature on classification in library and information science (LIS) journals and concludes that
the literature adheres to the Bradford’s law of scattering. It produces rank list of journals publishing the literature
on classification and identifies authorship patterns and the prominent writers in classification. The research finds
that the Indian LIS writers have shown sustained interest in classification domain.
Keywords: Classification, bibliometrics, rank list, authorship pattern, prominent authors in classification

1. INTRODUCTION
Classification is one of the oldest and prominent
knowledge organisation (KO) tools. It is the foundation of
librarianship and other KO tools. As such, a considerable
literature is published on classification1. In spite of being
used beneficially for years together, sometimes questions
are raised about the usefulness of classification in the
modern context. Particularly after the emergence of the
so-called magic technology, i.e., the computer and
telecommunication technology, the modern community is
raising number of questions. For example, whether
computer technology can be applied to the classification
and cataloguing of natural language texts, whether human
classification can be superseded by the powerful searching
capabilities of computerisation, how far computers can be
adopted in digital retrieval techniques, etc.
In 1999, Satyanarayana2 answered these questions
saying that as yet there are few signs that automatic
procedures are sufficiently developed to completely
replace manual ones. Gilchrist3 argued that the new
technology may have its own merits nevertheless the
principles of classification and indexing may lead to much
more accurate and targeted automatic searching and
retrieval than is possible at present. Not just this but he
further asserted that whichever system (knowledge
organisation system) may prevail the role of human
intellectual in grouping and labeling will remain very much

in demand. Thus, he emphasises that classification is
important and even the human involvement in
classification is equally important. Field4 too has a similar
observation to that of Satyanarayana, and indeed a very
apt observation. Based on his observation, he provides a
valuable piece of advice also. Field stated that the
librarians might be developing a tendency to neglect their
traditional skills in the rush to embrace the new icons of
the information age, such as knowledge management,
classification is an important technique of library and
information science and should not be neglected by in a
rush to embrace the modern technologies. Then what is
the reality, has library automation undermined the role of
classification? Slavic5 answers this question negatively.
According to Marcella6 there are number of areas where
there is scope for the application of classification. These,
for example, are organisation and exploitation of a
physical collection, archives, bibliographic records
(electronic and printed), internet resources, and
organisation’s internal information resources.
Classification is surely important in modern electronic
age, it is even more important in the ultramodern
semantic web context3,7. Matveyeva8 highlights the role of
classification in the context of electronic resources who
stated that, the traditional purpose of classification for
locating physical objects on the shelves loses its function
in the case of remote electronic resources. The other
function of classification is categorisation. It is more

useful in the case of electronic resources, for it promotes
the role of classification as a subject-organising tool.
Attempts at using library classification schemes in order
to organise electronic resources has moved beyond the
realm of libraries and their catalogues. Information
scientists, database developers, and specialists in
information retrieval have explored library classification’s
potential in organising information on the internet, in order
to improve browsing and subject searching.
Finally, how important is classification to
librarianship? Can the various knowledge organisation
tools and other related discoveries and inventions in LIS
including classification be ranked to show their relative
importance? Tyckoson9 lists and describes top ten
innovations in the history of librarianship and
classification systems is one of the top ten innovations in
librarianship. Considering the different opinions about the
future of library classification, the present research is
carried out to know the amount and nature of
classification literature that has been published in the first
decade of the 21st century.

2. RELATED LITERATURE
The search of literature on bibliometrics reveals that
bibliometrics studies are carried out on the various topics
of library and information science as well as on other than
library science subjects. Hawkins10 studied the
bibliometric characteristics of electronic journals (ejournals) covering the field of information science. He
identified twenty-eight e-journals and ranked them by
number of articles on the subject they published. It was
concluded that the ‘core’ as suggested by Bradford is yet
to develop, but it may contain six journals. According to
this study, common topics covered by e-journal articles in
information science include electronic libraries,
information search, retrieval, and use of the internet.
Singh, Mittal, & Ahmad11 studied growth and
characteristics of digital library literature. For this study,
the authors collected data of over 1000 articles from LISA
Plus. These articles were published during 1998-2004.
The study analysed authorship patterns, authors’
productivity and prominent contributors, language-wise
and year-wise distribution of articles, country-wise
distribution of journals, core journals in the subject area,
and indexing term frequency. The study found that 61
per cent articles were written by single authors; author
productivity was not in agreement with Lotka’s Law,
except in one case where number of articles is three; the
maximum number of articles were published in 2003 with
English being the most productive language; maximum
articles were published in the D-lib Magazine.
Patra, Bhattacharya, & Verma12 analysed growth
pattern, core journals and authors’ distribution in the field
of bibliometrics using data from LISA. The authors
180

observed that growth of literature did not show any definite
pattern. They adopted the Bradford’s Law of Scattering to
identify core journals and identified ‘Scientometrics’ as
the core journal in this field. Authors’ productivity patterns
were studied by applying Lotka’s Law and found that
those authors’ distributions do not follow original Lotka’s
law. This study also identified 12 most productive authors
with more than 20 publications in this field.
Chandrashekarai, Mulla, & Harinarayana13 conducted
bibliometric analysis of digital libraries in the Emerald
database from April 1991 to March 2009. The study found
that single authors contributed maximum numbers of
articles (i.e., 67.62 %). Amongst countries producing
literature on digital libraries, US was first with 31.94 per
cent articles followed by UK with 27.09 per cent.
Electronic Library journal ranked first among the
published literature on digital library. This study helps in
recognising the core journals in the field.
Guo14 observed that due to the tremendous increase
and variations in serial publications, the impact of every
peer-reviewed paper on different subjects is varying
continually. Domain experts or researchers want to keep
track of those latest and highly cited peer-reviewed
papers; however, they are finding it difficult to update or
collect core paper’s lists regularly and accurately.
Evaluation of serial papers for generating and ranking core
paper lists on different subjects becomes a very
challenging task for scholars and librarians. Therefore,
Guo developed a computer-aided bibliometric system
(CABS) to generate a core article ranked list
automatically. Four indicators–subject reference cited
counts, subject total cited counts, subject reference
period impact and subject reference cited history–were
proposed to generate a subject core article-ranking list.
Seven different subjects including e-commerce, data
mining, supply chain, image processing, enterprise
resource planning, microarray and expert systems were
used as samples. The study provides experimental
evidence to disprove three myths. Myth 1: the top papers
on a subject (for instance, the top 10 papers) were all
submitted to (S)SCI journals. Myth 2: the highly cited
papers (cited counts >4) on interdisciplinary subjects
were almost submitted to (S)SCI journals. Myth 3: the
articles published in the top journals on a subject would
be highly cited.
Chemoinformatics is one of the newly emerged
subjects. It draws on techniques from a range of
disciplines, most notably chemistry (particularly
computational and medicinal chemistry), computer
science and information science. Wallett15 carried out
bibliometric analysis of Chemoinformatics and discussed
subject, author, and citation searches of the Web of
Knowledge databases. The author found Journal of
Chemical Information and Modelling as the core journal of
the subject, but with many significant papers being
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(2)

published in journals whose principal focus is molecular
modelling, quantitative structure-activity relationships or
more general aspects of chemistry. The discipline is
international in scope, and many of the most cited papers
describe software packages that play a key role in
modern chemoinformatics research. Literature listed in
the Medline database on diabetes is analysed by
Krishnamoorthy, Ramkrishanan & Devi16. The authors
found that maximum records were published in 2003
followed by 2002 and 2001. The research found that US is
the largest contributor of literature on diabetes and the
research productivity of diabetes confirms the Bradford’s
Law of Scattering. Palmer17 analysed 12 tourism journals
published within a 5-year period (1998–2002) and
reviewed 1790 articles by means of a taxonomy with 24
statistical categories. The results showed the percentage
of articles that apply statistical techniques as compared
to those that do not, and a ranking of the techniques most
often used and their distribution according to journal.

3. OBJECTIVES
The overall purpose of this study is to analyse the
trends in the publication of articles on classification.
Specific objectives of the study are to:
(a)

Identify year-wise trends in the publications of
articles on classification;

(b)

Prepare rank list of journals publishing articles on
classification and to find core journals dealing with it;

(c)

Study the pattern of collaboration amongst authors
writing on classification;

(d)

Carry out quantitative analysis of the descriptors
assigned to abstracts in the Library and Information
Science Abstracts (LISA); and

(e)

Identify the major contributors to the field of
classification and to rank them.

4. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY
The present study covers articles published on
classification during a decade’s time-span, i.e., during
2000 to 2009. The study analyses the literature listed in
the LISA. The data required for the present study was
retrieved in April 2010 from the LISA database (http://
www.csa.com/). In the LISA database, literature was
searched under the ‘Classification’ descriptor. LISA
thesaurus recommends the term ‘Classification’ as a
preferred descriptor. This descriptor was used to search
the literature, as this is preferable to keywords. This to
some extent helped in limiting the number of irrelevant
items. Due to this, however, some researchers who have
written on more specific areas of the field may have been
excluded. Secondly, some well-known author’s position

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(2)

in the rank list of authors (Table 5) may have slightly
changed. This limitation may have a minor implication on
the list of core journals (Fig. 1). The implication may be
minor because there is very insignificant difference in the
productivity of 2nd to 5th ranked journals. The search
retrieved total 2906 records. The bibliographic information
including the descriptors given along with abstracts in the
LISA were transferred in the MS-Excel sheet for
quantitative analysis. The data was analysed by year of
publication, journal-wise. The data was also analysed to
find patterns of authorship collaboration. The numbers of
descriptors were analysed, to find trends if any. Author’s
contributions were also counted.
The technique of bibliometrics has been adopted for
the purpose of this study. Bibliometrics is the application
of mathematical and statistical methods to books and
other media of communication11. Bibliometric analysis is
used for effective management of libraries, particularly for
formulating collection development policies, and for
making decisions related with inter library loan (ILL),
collection maintenance, etc.

5. ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
The collected data is analysed to accomplish the
above stated objectives. MS-Excel is used to analyse the
data and to display the results.

5.1 Year-wise Publication Trend
Classification has been foundation of librarianship. It
is used since the origin of libraries for marking and parking
of documents. In due course of time, classification was
used for other purposes also. For example, it was used in
the organisation of entries in classified catalogue, deriving
subject heading for cataloguing and indexing purpose,
producing systematic display of thesaural entries,
construction of thesaurofacets, etc. Increased use of
computer and related developments such as artificial
intelligence, natural language processing, semantic web
and other developments created an apprehension about
the value of library classification. What effect is there of
such developments. The collected data was analysed
year-wise so as to know if such thinking has any adverse
effect on the number of articles published on the topic.
Table 1 indicates that on an average 290 articles were
published per year during the decade covered by this
study. This means about 10 per cent of the total articles
are published per year. Highest number of articles were
published in 2005 (i.e., 368, 12.66 %) followed by 2004
(i.e., 364, 12.52 %) and 2006 (i.e., 346, 11.90 %). Least
numbers of articles were published in 2007 as well as in
2009 (i.e., 237, 8.15 %). However, it must be noted that
there is no definite trend as far as the publication of
articles on classification is concerned.

What is also noticeable is that the number of articles
published on classification has not decreased. Probable
reasons for the sustained interest of the LIS professionals
in the classification could be that they (and other
professionals, particularly information technology
professionals) have found and are finding newer
applications of classification. These newer applications
include use of classification in text categorisation/
automatic classification18-20; in the management web
contents21-24; in organising resources in the institutional
repositories25 ; in resource discovery from internet26. The
other new areas where classification is applied are the
creation and maintenance of semantic web tools such as
taxonomy27, ontology28-29, folksonomy30.

5.2 Application of Bradford’s Law of Scattering
Total 2906 articles were published in 363 journals.
These journals were arranged in the order of decreasing
productivity of articles. Purpose of this arrangement was
to know whether the ‘Scatter’ trend satisfies Bradford’s
Law of Scatter31; and to get list of core journals in
classification. Journals in the resultant rank list were
grouped in three zones as shown in Table 2.

The data analysed in Table 2 satisfies Bradford’s Law.
The data proves that very few, i.e., only six journals
published one third (i.e., 985) of the total (2906) articles.
These form part of the core journals. Whereas the same
number of articles as that of the first zone were published
in 46 and 311 journals of second and third zones,
respectively.

5.3 Core Journals
According to Bradford’s Law of Scattering the journals
forming part of the first zone are the core journals. This
182

Figure 1. List of core journals.

study found that six journals (Table 2) form part of the core
journals on classification. These are shown in Fig. 1. Six
core journals listed in Fig. 1 produced one third (i.e., 985,
approximately) of the total (2906) articles. Titles of the
three journals forming part of core journals indicate that
they are exclusively devoted to ‘classification’ and so they
are rightly forming part of this core list. These three
journals are Cataloging & Classification Quarterly, Journal
of Classification and Knowledge Organization.
Cataloguing & Classification Quarterly could be called as
‘super core journal’ as more than 50 per cent of the 985
articles are published by this journal. Patra,
Bhattacharya, & Verma12 in their study of literature on
bibliometrics also found a single journal, i.e.,
Scientometrics as the core journal in this field. Electronic
Library journal was identified as core journal in the
bibliometrics study of digital library literature13.
It would have been ideal to have the ‘Knowledge
Organisation’ journal within first three as against its
present forth rank. The Journal of the China Society for
Scientific and Technical Information and the Journal of
the American Society for Information Science and
Technology ranking third and fourth, respectively, indicate
that these journals are producing a considerable amount
of literature on classification. However, it should be also
noticed that the journals ranking second to fifth are
producing almost the same number of articles. Thus, the
methodology adopted for searching the literature, has no
adverse effect, as the difference in these journals’
productivity is very insignificant. The sixth journal, i.e.,
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine ranking fifth is probably
an odd title in the list of core journals on classification.
Whether this is because of LISA’s specific indexing
policies, need to be investigated.

5.4 Pattern of Authorship Collaboration
To know whether the writers writing on ‘classification’
prefer to write individually or they write collaboratively was
the purpose of this analysis. It is observed (Fig. 2) that
single authors contributed more than 60 per cent articles.
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(2)

Similar results were found in other two studies on
bibliometrics of digital libraries. For example, Singh,
Mittal, & Ahmad11 found that single authors wrote 61
per cent articles; whereas Chandrashekarai, Mulla, &
Harinarayana13 found that single authors wrote 67.62 per
cent articles. At the same time trends in collaborative
writing is encouraging as remaining 40 per cent authors
are writing in collaboration. 25 per cent and 10 per cent
authors have joined hand with other one and two authors
respectively.
The pure and applied sciences are truly universal and
are extreme generalised. In addition, the pure and applied
scientists have excellent network of invisible college. Due
to these reasons, it is generally observed that writers in
these subjects tend to write jointly as against individually.
Such trend is not much noticed in the social sciences
may be due to their subjective nature. Nevertheless, the
present analysis does indicate that a considerable
number of articles, i.e., 40 per cent are written jointly. The
writers on classification not only are joining hands with
one or two other authors but even more than three authors
also (Table 3).
In addition to those authors mentioned in Fig. 2 and
Table 3, there are five articles, each one of which is written
collaboratively by 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17 authors. These
are example of extreme collaboration and these are
noticed in the articles written in 2004 or later. This means
collaboration amongst the writers on classification is
increasing gradually. Whether there is similar trend in
other LIS subjects or not is worth studying. Collaboration
between four or more authors is mostly noticed in the
articles of automatic classification/text categorisation.

Note that the data given in Fig. 2 and Table 3 is to be
considered together; 35 articles’ entries in the LISA are
without author’s name; and all these together make 100
per cent.

5.5 Quantitative Analysis of Descriptors
The data for this research article was collected from
LISA. Abstracts in LISA are supported with number of
descriptors. These descriptors help in searching
abstracts in the LISA use of precise descriptors is a key
to have precision in retrieval. The 2906 articles analysed
in this study had total 12,430 descriptors, i.e.,
approximately 4 (precisely 4.27) descriptors per article.
The data about the number of descriptors was analysed to
know if there are any patterns. The following Table 4
presents the analysis.
There is noticeable deviation from the average number
of descriptors. For example, in 2004 the average number
of descriptors used is five as against the overall average
four. On the contrary in the year 2008 about three
descriptors are used as against the overall average four
descriptors. The analysis of the average number of
descriptors from 2005 in the above table indicates that
gradually the average number of descriptors is
decreasing. To confirm the trend further study is needed.
Similarly, the maximum number of descriptors used
seems to decreasing. The number of descriptors in the
first half of the decade ranges from 11 to 19, whereas in
the second half it ranges between 5 to 15. Abstracts in the
last three years, i.e., 2007, 2008 and 2009 have

maximum nine, five, and six descriptors, respectively,
which are very less compared to the maximum
descriptors in the earlier years, i.e., 14 (2001), 15 (2006),
and 19 (2004). Further study is needed in this context to
know the reasons, if any for using less number of
descriptors.

5.6 Prominent Contributors to Classification
Literature
As in any field, in classification too it is noticed that
there are few authors (i.e., 48 authors) who have written
five or more articles. Table 5 lists and ranks the top ten
authors who have contributed five or more articles to the
field of classification. Inan Guler tops the list with 15
articles. Vanda Broughton and R.P. Smiraglia are sharing
the second rank with 14 articles each. A. Neelameghan
and Aida Slavic are ranking third and fourth with 13 and 11
articles, respectively. D. Vizine-Goetz and Arelene G.
Taylor who have contributed 10 articles each share the
fifth rank. The data about the writers was analysed to
know how many of them have written as first authors in
joint-authorship pattern and it was observed that almost
all of them have written most of the articles as first author,
and very few have written their most articles as second
author. This means the major contributors to a subject
field mostly keep their name as first author.
What is worth noticing is that in the 48 authors
contributing five or more articles to classification there are
five Indian authors at rank number three, seven, nine (two
authors) and ten, respectively. These writers are
continuing the legacy of Indian interest in classification
inculcated S.R. Ranganathan.

6. CONCLUSIONS
Being a multi-functional tool, article literature on
classification has a steady growth. About 300 articles are
published per year, which is a satisfactory trend. The
trend of collaboration among the writers of classification is
