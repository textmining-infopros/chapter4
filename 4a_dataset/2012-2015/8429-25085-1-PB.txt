The  aim  of  this  work  is  to  analyse  research  productivity  of  life  sciences  faculty  members  at  the  Savitribai  Phule  Pune  University  (SPPU),  Maharashtra,  India.  The  research  is  conducted  with  the  intention  to  know  the  research  productivity  over  15  years  (1999-2013),  the  citations  received,    collaborations, and authorship patterns. Web of Science (WoS) database was used for the bibliographic  and citation data.  Data were analysed by using bibliometric techniques and software such as HistCite,  Intcoll,  and  Pajek.  Results  show  that  the  research  productivity  of  faculty  members  is  increasing,  their  publications  are  getting  good  citations  and  thereby  their  journals  have  better  Impact  Factor.  The  faculty  members  have  collaborated  with  prominent  international  researchers  and  have  extended  interdisciplinary research. The paper is based on empirical data exclusively gathered for this research.

1.  IntroDUctIon 
Citation  analysis  is  being  used  as  a  tool  for  evaluation of research contributions made by scientific  community.  It  is  used  for  counting  of  citations  of  particular  research  institute  or  scientists.  Citation  analysis is a method that interlink a document with  another  on  a  specific  subject.  This  performance  measure  assumes  that  influential  scientists  and  important works were cited more often than others1.   Researcher working in this field have used various  parameters, viz., number of papers, citations received,  h-index, impact factor of journals, etc., to measure  the research output of researchers and organisations.   Hirsch2  calculated the h-indices that correlate positively  with  citation  counts,  publication  counts  and  peer  evaluation  of  research  impact  and  quality.  
In the present study, the research contributions by  faculty members of seven Life sciences departments of  Savitribai Phule Pune University (formerly, University  of  Pune,  the  name  was  modified  to  the  current  name  in  2014)  (http://unipune.ac.in),  India  was  measured  on  the  basis  of  various  bibliometric  parameters.  Among  its  seven  departments,  the  oldest department is Zoology department established  
in  1950.  It  has  received  recognition  as  Centre  for  Advanced  Studies  (CAS)  by  the  University  Grants  Commission  (UGC)  since  2005.  The  department  has  also  received  funds  from  DST  (Department  of  Science and Technology), Government of India under  the  Fund  for  Improvement  of  S&T  Infrastructure  in  Higher  Educational  Institutions  (FIST)  programme.  The second oldest department within life science is  Botany  Department  established  in  1952.  It  is  one  of  the  leading  departments  in  the  field  of  teaching  and  research  in  plant  sciences.  The  Department  of  Microbiology  was  established  in  1977  and  well  recognised  due  to  the  number  of  projects  funded  by  agencies,  viz.,  Board  of  Research  in  Nuclear  Sciences  (BRNS)  of  Department  of Atomic  Energy  (DAE),  UGC,  Council  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research (CSIR), DBT, DST, Indian Space Research  Organisation  (ISRO),  Indian  Council  of Agricultural  Research  (ICAR),  etc.  The  Bioinformatics  Centre  was  established  in  1987.  Department  of  Health  Science  has  received  a  seed  grant  from  UGC  in  1989 to initiate interdisciplinary teaching in the field  of health sciences. The Department of Biotechnology  was  established  in  1994.  It  offers  a  2  year  MSc  Biotechnology course supported by the Department of

Number of quantitative studies have been conducted  and  reported  based  on  bibliometric  parameters  to  measure the research output of individual scientists,  universities, research institutes, and research areas.  Bibliometric  parameters,  viz.,  authorship  pattern,  citations  received  per  paper,  highly  cited  journals,  international collaborations, h-index, etc., were used  in  these  studies.    Many  of  the  studies  have  used  Web  of  Science  (WoS)  and  Scopus  databases  as  the source of data.  Various software tools are used  for data analysis and visualisation, viz., VOSViewer,  HistCite,  Pajek,  etc.  
Among the Indian studies, Siwach & Kumar analysed  the  research  contributions  made  by  researchers  of  Maharshi  Dayanand  University  (Rohtak)3.  They  found that chemistry department is at the first rank  in  publishing  papers  during  2000-2013  whereas  highest  numbers  of  citations  were  received  for  the  papers  published  in  the  field  of  biotechnology.  Hanumappa4 et.al.,  assessed  research  in  Gujarat  University, Ahmedabad in which they analysed 760  papers  extracted  from  Scopus  database  published  during  2004-2013.  The  results  indicated  that  the  publications trend is good but needs to be improved  as  compared  to  other  universities.  Pal  &  Ahmed5 studied contributions from 8 NE-Indian Universities  and  analysed  the  publications  published  during  
1994-2013.  They  found  that  average  growth  rate  (AGR)  has  increased  over  the  period.  The  growth  rate  is  tremendous  during  2004-2013  due  to  easy  accessibility of electronic papers and databases for  research.  Kumbar6   studied  research  contributions  (1518  papers)  by  University  of  Mysore  during  the  period 1996-2006 indexed in Scopus database. Results  show that science and technology is on growing path.  International research activities are small (14 %) but  the chemistry, physics, astronomy, biochemistry are  dominating research areas.  Sambalpur University’s  research was analysed by Maharana7,et.al.  Gopikuttan  & Awasthy8  measured research productivity of Kerala  University  &  Sudhier9   studied  research  output  of  Physicists  of  the  same  university.  In  these  studies  the data set was downloaded from Web of Science  database.  The  results  of  these  studies  indicated  that chemistry, physics, astronomy and astrophysics  are  the  leading  areas  of  research.  The  highest  numbers  of  international  collaborations  are  with  scientists  from  USA.  
Research output of scientists for different Indian  Institutes  of  Technology  (IITs)  was  measured  by  Chavan  &  Chaurasia10   for  IIT  Delhi  for  the  period  2001-2010;    Singh11 et.al.,   for  IIT,  Rurkela  for  the  period  1993-2001  and  Jeevan  &  Gupta12 for  IIT  Kharakpur for the period 1994-1997. All three studies  measured  quantitatively  the  impact  of  research  produced.  All  these  studies  have  used  Web  of  Science database (WoS) for data set. These studies  measured individual scientist’s research productivity  as well as institutional level. Science, engineering and  technology,  physics,  chemistry  and  earth  sciences  are  the  prominent  research  areas.  Collaborative  papers  are  more  and  USA  ranks  first  in  case  of  international  collaborations.  Mishra  &  Sarangi13 conducted  bibliometrics  studies  of  IITs  as  well  as  National Institutes of Technologies (NITs) which have  national importance. They ranked these technology  institutes  as  per  the  citations  received  for  papers  and  faculty  h-index.  The  data  were  collected  from  Scopus  database  for  the  period  2012-2014.  
Some  studies  measured  research  output  of  individual  departments  of  different  universities.  Nandi  &  Bandopadhaya14   analysed  719  articles  from  216  PhD  thesis  submitted  to  department  of  zoology,  University  of  Burdwan  during  1960-2000.  Results indicated that highest numbers of theses are  submitted in the subject entomology.  Indian journals  were  highly  cited  whereas  multi-authored  papers  are  cited  more  than  single  and  double  authored  papers.  Scientometric  analysis  of  Indian  research  output using SCI for 1997 was undertaken by Garg15 et.al.   Authors  found  that  universities/colleges  are  the major contributors of research papers, whereas  IITS,  medical  colleges  and  CSIR  institutes  are  followed  the  further  ranks.  Physical,  chemical  and

medical sciences are the dominant research areas.  Mahrana16  conducted bibliometric analysis of Orissa  University  of  Agricultural  Technology’s  research  output  as  indexed  in  Scopus  in  2008-2012.  It  was  noticed  that  most  of  the  papers  are  published  in  Indian journals and in collaborations. Collaborations  are at national and international levels. The growth  rate  of  publications  is  slow  and  steady. 
All above mentioned studies analysed the author  productivity,  areas  of  specialisation,  publication  pattern, authorship patterns, most prolific authors and  list  of  preferred  journals  by  authors  for  publishing.  Majority  of  the  studies  used  quantitative  methods  for  measuring  the  research.  Web  of  Science  and  Scopus  databases  were  used  for  data  sets.  The  results  of  these  studies  indicate  that  there  is  a  steady growth in publications and citations received.  The  studies  also  identified  strong  and  weak  areas  of  research  as  well  as  national  and  international  collaborations of researchers.  USA is the first choice  of  researchers  for  international  collaborations.

4.  MethoDoLogY,  ScoPe AnD LIMItAtIonS 
Data  required  for  the  present  study  were  collected from WoS database for the period 1999- 2013.    Initially  the  address  field  was  used  to  get  the  papers  published  by  researches  of  SPPU.  But  it  was  noticed  that  retrieved  data  set  has  papers  published by researchers from affiliated colleges of  SPPU.  Therefore,  Life  science  department  names  within the University with variations in full form and  short  form  were  searched  in  Address  (AD)  field.  Later  all  possible  variations  in  the  name  of  SPPU  were  searched  in  the  field  ‘Organisation  Enhanced  (OG).   AD  and  OG  fields  were  then  combined  with  AND operator to get the exact data set. Biochemistry  and  Biophysics  papers  were  excluded  from  the  study  as  these  papers  were  already  included  in  Chemistry  and  Physics  department  studies17.  With  the above-mentioned logic, following search strategy  was  used  with  necessary  refinements: 
OG=(university of pune OR university of poona  OR  univ  pune  OR  pune  univ  OR  univ  poona  OR  poona univ) AND AD=(biotechnol OR biotechnology

The  final  data  set  has  690  research  papers  written  by  Life  sciences  faculties  of  SPPU  during  1999  to  2013.  The  retrieved  bibliographic  and  citation data were analysed by using the traditional  bibliometric techniques. HistCite, Intcoll, Pajek as well  as  VoSViewer  software  tools  were  also  used.  
In  the  present  study  the  data  set  is  small  to  measure the degree of collaborations and therefore  not included. Moreover, in the present study individual  author’s research productivity is not considered and  therefore  prolific  author  is  not  listed.  The  present  study focused on the research productivity of 7 Life  science  departments  of  the  SPPU.  
5.  DAtA AnALYSIS 
5.1 types  of  Documents 
Total 690 records which had affiliation to SPPU  were  published  during  1999-2013.  Of  these,  590  publications  were  published  as  journal  articles,  38  as reviews and 20 as letters. These three categories  of  document  types  constituted  about  94  %  of  all  records  and  rest  6  %  records  were  published  as  proceeding  papers(16),  meeting  abstracts(14),  editorials(8),  book  chapters(3),  and  corrections(1).  All  publications  (690)  were  considered  for  further  analysis.  
5.2 Subject Areas 
Table 2 indicates that apart from various facets of  Life sciences, the faculty members have researched  with diverse subject fields including physics, chemistry,  environmental  science  and  engineering.  
5.3  Yearly contributions 
Table  3  presents  chronologically,  the  number  of  papers  contributed  by  the  seven  departments  during 1999-2013. It also presents average citations  received  per  paper  (ACPP). 
Table  3  also  reveals  that  almost  every  year  faculty  members  have  contributed  more  papers  than the previous year. The growth range is steady  which is certainly considerable. However, there are  exceptions  to  this. The  exception  is  that  either  the  same  number  of  papers  were  published  in  two  consecutive  years  (e.g.,  in  1999  &  2000  as  well  as in 2009 & 2010) or less number of papers were  published  in  the  subsequent  year  (e.g.,    2001  &  2002  as  well  as  in  2005  &  2006).  
Table  3  also  indicates  that  60  %  of  the  total  publications are contributed during the last 5 years

i.e., during 2009-2013. Considerable number of new  recruitments  could  be  one  of  the  reasons  for  this  noticeable  growth  in  publications.  Higher  number  and  amounts  of  research  grants  were  received  during this period on account of the University being  recognised  as  ‘University  of  Potential,  Excellence’  and  Major  and  Minor  Research  projects’.  In  the  year 2009 the UGC brought in the new scheme for  career advancement for the faculties. The Academic  performance indicators of this scheme necessitated  every faculty to publish research papers. This could  be the third major reason for the considerable growth  in  the  publications  during  2009-2013.  Increase  in  number of journals along with the origin and growth  of open access journals could also be a reason for  
increase  in  publications  of  Life  sciences  faculties  of  the  SPPU.    
Study  of  the  citations  in  Table  3  indicates  that  there is no definite pattern in the citations received  by the studied Life sciences papers. For example in  the  year  2009  papers  received  1077  (13.80  CPP)  out  of  total  6210  citations.  As  against  this  in  the  current year, i.e., 2013 only 48 (0.52 CPP) citations  were received. Publication of papers on new topic,  application of new research method could be some  of the reasons for getting extraordinary high citations.  Contrary  to  this  publication  of  papers  on  a  known  theme  could  be  a  reason  for  not  receiving  better  number  of  citations.    
5.4  national  collaboration  
Faculty  members  of  SPPU  have  research  collaborations  with  other  experts  in  India  from  other  institutions  in  the  field  of  Life  sciences.  It  is  noticed that faculty members have collaborations with  total  201  National  Institutes  including  Universities,  colleges  and  Research  laboratories.  Table  4  lists  collaborations with top ten Indian institutions along  with  no.  of  papers  published.  
Table 4 indicates that most National collaborations  are however, from Pune itself. Easy accessibility to  laboratories can be one of the reasons for this. Data  indicates that the highest number of collaborations  is with the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC),  Mumbai. This indicates that the research conducted  is  truly  interdisciplinary.  The  trend  also  indicates  that there are collaboration between the academics  and  scientists  (those  working  is  laboratories).  This  interdisciplinary  and  multidisciplinary  approach  is  reflected  through  the  areas  of  research  as  shown  in  Table  2  by  faculty  members.    
Further, it is noticed the pattern of collaborations  at  National  level  are  changed  over  the  period  and

more  number  of  papers  are  published  with  BARC,  NCL, and other institutes.  Figure 1 shows it clearly  that number of collaborative publications are increased  after  2006  and  the  trend  is  continued.  
5.5  International  collaborations  
Collaborations  in  the  scientific  research  are  seen  essential  and  useful  for  universalisation  and  validation of the research. In collaborative research  numbers of experts contribute to the given research.  Multiplicity  of  contributing  brains  help  increase  quality of research. This is the reason International  collaborations are considered more valuable in the  research field. Study of international collaborations  of faculty members of 7 Life sciences departments

at  SPPU  reveals  that  they  have  collaborated  with  total 32 countries and have received 2016 citations.  Country-wise  collaborations  are  given  in  figure  1.  The  top  ten  countries  are  listed  in  Table  5.  
Total  125  (18  %)  papers  are  written  with  International  collaborations.  This  percentage  is  quite  encouraging.  What  is  further  noticeable  that  the  highest  number  collaborations  (41  papers)  are  with  USA.  Along  with  USA,  European  countries  too  are  the  major  contributors  in  scientific  and  technological  research.  Considering  this  value  of  European  countries  it  is  noteworthy  to  observe  that  there  are  five  European  countries  in  the  top  ten  countries  with  which  the  studied  life  science’s  faculties  have  collaborated.  Total  51  (41  %)  of  the  125  international  collaborations  are  with  European  countries. The collaborated five European countries  are  leading  contributors  to  scientific  research.  It  is  also worth noting that Iran is emerging as preferred  Asian collaborator (ranked fourth) of the life science  faculties  of  SPPU. 
Study of the citations received by the 125 papers  written  with  International  collaborations  reveals  that  they  have  received  26  %  (i.e.,  1588  of  6210)  citations. This is a considerable percentage. Analysis  of  average  citations  received  reveals  that  papers  written  in  collaboration  with  European  countries  have  received  much  higher  citations.  For  example,  papers  written  in  collaboration  with  France  have  received highest average citations (i.e., 27) followed  by  Denmark  26,  UK  17  and  Germany  15.  By  the  criteria  of  average  citations  received  per  paper,

are  collaborative  publications.  There  are  only  24  single  (3  %)  authored  publications,  two-authored  93 (14 %) publications, multi-authored (3-4 authors)  294 (43 %) publications and mega-authored (5 and  above  authors)  278  (40  %)  publications.  This  data  indicates  that  science  researchers  including  life  science  researchers  mostly  prefer  to  research  and  write  in  collaboration.    
5.7  journals  Preferred    
Faculty  members  have  written  in  total  362  Journals including Indian and foreign journals.  Out  of  362  journals  17  journals  were  selected  in  which  more  than  five  papers  are  published.  Among  17  journals  (Table  6)  faculty  members  have  preferred  four  Indian  journals,  viz.,  Current  Science   (35  papers)  and   Journal  of  Biosciences   (10  papers),  Indian  Journal  of  Biotechnology   (7  papers)  and  Indian Journal of Experimental Biology   (7  papers).  The average impact factor of these four journals is  0.98. Current Science is one of the most prominent  journals  published  in  India  in  the  field  of  science.  It  is  worth  noting  that  out  of  17  most  preferred  journals,  13  are  International  journals.  Among  these  journals,  seven  journals  are  published  from  USA  among  which  five  are  published  by  Elsevier  Science  publisher.    The  average  impact  factor  of  these  seven  journals  is  3.16.    Journals  from  UK  the  Netherlands  and  ranks  third  and  fourth  in  the  
authored  papers  as  there  are  665  papers  (97  %)  
Author and collaborative trends is towards multi-  
top  17  list  having  3.47  and  2.32  average  impact

6.  concLUSIonS 
This  attempt  of  quantitative  analysis  of  papers  published  by  faculty  members  of  Life  Science  Departments of SPPU shows that the faculty members  are  very  active  in  research  in  areas  not  only  Life  sciences but in interdisciplinary areas like biophysics,  biochemistry,  environmental  sciences,  engineering  and  medical  sciences.  The  contributions  of  these  departments  are  well  recognised  at  National  and  International  levels.  This  conclusion  is  based  on  the  following  findings: 
•	 Year 	 of 	 establishments 	 of 	 each 	 seven 	 departments 	 
single  author.  Three  and  four-author  papers  have  received  more  citations.  
are different and new interdisciplinary departments  
are  established  by  the  university  in  the  areas  like  biotechnology,  bioinformatics  and  health
