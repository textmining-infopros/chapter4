Due to proliferation and multi-disciplinary relevance in all the subjects, lot of digital information in  various formats is knocking the doors of the knowledge seekers and it can be accessed by using tools  and techniques of information and communication technology (ICT). The present study is on how library  and  information  science  (LIS)  professionals  use  mobile  phones  for  getting  access  to  the  information,  usefulness of mobile technologies in their learning activity, their attitudes towards use of mobile devices  and  its  impact  on  their  behaviours. The  results  reveals  that  majority  of  LIS  users  most  frequently  use  mobiles for communication purpose operating from their homes and expend 1-2 hours daily on mobiles  using a 3G network. They are well aware about search techniques and skills to access information on  internet  over  mobiles  and  use  it  for  downloading  implications  by  not  participating  in  online  discussion/ chatting forum on internet. Further survey perceived that they are not using mobile for fnancial transaction  and online shopping. The paper concluded that basic knowledge accompanied with self-learning skill is  the pre-requisite for easy handling of mobile and its related technologies for all kinds of professionals.   
Keywords: Mobile, smart phone, internet, LIS user, mobile use. 
1.  INtrODUctION 
In the recent decade internet and mobile access  are the two major attractions amongst the younger  generation.  However,  with  the  advent  of  wireless  communication  technologies,  the  internet  and  its  allied technologies are accessed from portable hand  held devices like mobile phones (M-phone), Personal  Digital Assistance (PDAs) etc. It is observed that in  the  recent  years  the  use  of  such  portable  devices  has  increased  phenomenally.  So  the  concepts  like  virtual  network,  virtual  library,  M-library  etc  are  in  force. There are different brands, models and public  networks  are  available  in  the  market  for  m-phone  services, each of them having distinct features and  operating styles. Only users can find which devices  and network services are best suited for their work  and  interest.  
2. rEVIEW  OF tHE  LItErAtUrE 
Review  of  literature  is  necessary  to  know  the  findings  of  similar  studies  carried  out  in  the  past  and uniqueness of the present study to the present.  Carroll & others1   contributes  to  information  system  design, marketing and training practice by describing  the  influences  on  16  to  22  years  old  appropriation  of  mobile  telephones.  A  survey  on  mobile  internet  was  carried  out  by  Rice  &  Katz2   which  shows  internet  and  mobile  phone  usage  was  very  similar  and that several digital divides exist with respect to  
both  internet  and  mobile  phone  usage.  Kinshuk  &  Chen3   suggests  application  of  mobile  devices  like  mobile  phones  and  PDAs  for  educational  services  and describes a mock-up system to integrate these  services  into  the  mobile  platform.  Mobile  devices  can  play  a  vital  role  in  the  teaching  of  languages  it  is  reflected  when  Cooney  &  Keogh4   published  an  article  to  investigate  the  use  of  m-learning  for  teaching and learning Irish language. Asif & Krogstie5 in their paper describe system for providing relevant  information  to  students  on  a  mobile  platform.  
Bomhold6 conducted  a  survey  to  know  use  of  smart phone applications by undergraduate university  students which reflects that majority of students use  mobile apps for completing their academic activities.  Burford & Park7  explore the information behaviours  of  young  adults  when  they  are  given  unlimited  access  to  mobile  tablet  devices;  it  establishes  the  potential  for  constant  access  to  digital  information  for their research related activities. Kumar8  explores  the  students’  opinion  regarding  use  and  success  of  mobile  technology  in  the  library  environment  for  providing better services by library. Rhoda & Lee9 in  their  study  examine  the  use  of  mobile  devices  for  the delivery of emergency notifications information to  end users from a mobile government (m-government)  perspective.  It  is  known  from  above  review  that  no  any  study  was  dealt  with  use  of  m-phones  for  information seeking behavior particularly towards LIS

discipline;  hence  the  present  study  is  undertaken.   
3.  MObILE tEcHNOLOGY    
Information and communication are the two sides  of the same coin and can’t be separated from each  other.  To  handle  the  smooth  flow  of  information,  communication  channels  like  radio,  TV,  computer,  internet and now mobiles play a vital role. However,  to access these channels one has to use each of the  media  separately  or  in  combination  at  a  particular  physical  space.  On  the  contrary,  portable  device  like  mobile  phones  can  be  accessed  and  used  anywhere,  which  is  now  bundled  with  services  like  music,  video,  internet,  camera,  m-commerce,  etc,  apart  from  using  it  for  communication.  The  prime  characteristic  of  m-phone  includes  high  degree  of  mobility,  flexibility  and  independence  in  use.  
4.  ObJEctIVES 
The  main  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: (a) Understand  the  brand/model  and  network  of  
mobile  phones  used  by  the  lis  professionals  (b) Know  the  purposes  for  using  mobile  phones (c) Know the place of access of mobiles, time and  
money  spent  on  the  use  of  mobile  phones  (d) Analyse use of mobile services like mobile internet,  
e-mail,  whatsapp,    and  allied  applications (e) Understand  awareness  about  techniques  and  
methods  of  accessing  information  through  
mobiles 
(f) Kind of information accessed by professionals;  
and 
(g) Know the impact of mobiles on LIS professionals  
behavior  and  to  ascertain  the  diverse  effect  of  
mobile  technologies. 
5. rESEArcH  MEtHODOLOGY  
The  survey  method  of  research  is  used  to  carry  out  the  present  research  work.  The  data  is  collected through structured questionnaire focusing  on  factors  like  purposes  of  using  mobiles,  internet  access,  search  techniques  used  for  accessing  information over mobiles and impact of mobiles on  LIS  professionals  behavior.  
5.1  Scope  and  Limitation 
The  scope  of  the  study  is  limited  to  students,  teachers and professional staff working at Department  of Library and Information Science, Shivaji University,  Kolhapur and the colleges affiliated to Shivaji University,  Kolhapur,  Maharashtra.  A  random  sample  of  70  LIS  professionals  including  professionals  (such  as  librarians  and  teachers)  and  students  (viz.,  BLISc,  MLISc  and  PhD)  etc.,  were  selected,  out  of  which  54  responded  (77.14  %).  From  the  responded  
population,  36  (66.66  %)  are  LIS  students  i.e.,  BLIsc 12 (22.22 %), MLISc 17 (31.48 %) remaining  7  (12.96  %)  are  PhD  research  students  whereas  18 (33.33 %) are working LIS professionals i.e., 14  (25.92  %)  librarians  and  4  (7.40  %)  teachers  from  8  affiliated  colleges. 
6.  DAtA ANALYSIS AND  DIScUSSION 
From the total survey of LIS users 29 (53.70 %)  are  male  and  25  (46.30  %)  are  female.  59.25  %  LIS professionals have smart phones and remaining  40.74  %  users  have  general  phone.  Not  a  single  LIS  user  has  tablet  like  hand-held  devices.

mobile apps, 15 (27.77 %) are not using for online  discussion through mobile internet. 13 (24.07 %) are  frequently  using  it  for  entertainment  and  equal  number  of  them  are  not  taking  benefit  of  it  for  entertainment  purposes  (Table  2).  
6.5 Accessing techniques  and  Skills 
• It  is  heartening  to  note  that  50  (92.59  %)  of  
LIS users are well aware about the techniques  
and  skills  regarding  accessing  of  information  
through  mobiles.  85.18  %  of  LIS  users  adopt  
Google  search  engine  as  a  tool  to  access  
information  over  mobiles,  followed  by  keyword  
search (59.25 %), other search engines (38.88 %),  
Boolean  operator  (29.62  %),  by  knowing  web  
address  (27.77  %),  referring  search  history  
(25.92  %),  by  citing  internet  sources  (9.25  %),  
by narrow/limit search option (7.40 %), avoiding  
use  of  suffixes  (3.70  %)  and  by  avoiding  use  
of  website  contain  multiple  advertisement  by  
(1.85  %). 
• Regarding  kind  of  information  accessed  by  
LIS  professionals  from  mobiles,  it  is  noticed  
network/service provider after more than 3 year.  18.51  %  of  them  are  of  the  opined  that  they  don’t  like  to  change  network/service  provider,  after  2  year  by  (11.11  %),  yearly  (9.25  %),  six  monthly (7.40 %) and monthly (5.55 %). No any  LIS  user  change  mobile  network  on  quarterly  or  weekly  basis.        
7.  SUGGEStIONS  
Following  suggestions are given by LIS professionals  regarding  use  of  cellular  technology: 
• Internet services offered by cellular companies  
(through mobiles) are cheaper than other mode  
of  access 
• Access  to  internet  on  all  the  models  of  mobile  
handset 
• Mobile based library services should be provided  
by  library  for  their  stakeholders 
• Alertness  about  health  consciousness 
8. cONcLUSIONS 
It  has  been  observed  from  the  study  that  LIS  
that  news  item  (57.40  %)  is  the  first  priority,  
followed by academic information like e-resources,  
professionals make greater use of mobiles to strengthen  OPAC,  assignment  over  e-mail,  conference,  
their  various  academic  and  research  activities  by  (55.55 %) and the equal number of respondents  
accessing  internet  on  mobiles.  Now  use  of  mobile  for entertainment related media information like  
is  as  essential  as  the  food  in  day  to  day  life.  The  youtube,  classic  e-book/literature,  etc.  Current  
growth  and  development  in  mobile  technology  is  [alerting] information by (50 %), general information  
fabulous,  which  makes  academia  life  smarter  and  (44.44  %),  multimedia  information  (22.22  %),  
easy.  It  is  need  of  the  hour  to  grab  and  use  the  full  text  information  (18.51  %),  information

6.6  Impact  of  Mobiles 
• It  is  observed  from  the  analysis  that  excess  
depend  under  the  impression  of  e-learning  and  m-learning. Basic knowledge accompanied with self- learning  skill  is  the  pre-requisite  for  easy  handling  
of  mobile  and  its  related  technologies  for  all  kinds  use  of  mobiles  makes  impact  on  information  
of  professionals.
