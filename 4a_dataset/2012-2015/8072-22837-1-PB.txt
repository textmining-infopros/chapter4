The study aims to assess library service quality (LSQ) associated with user satisfaction of AC Joshi  Library, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India. A modifed SERVQUAL instrument was used to examine  perceived LSQ and level of user satisfaction. The data was collected through questionnaire consisting  items related with different library service attributes.The study considered a number of critical elements of  service quality assessment. It was found that library environment and library services signifcantly predict  the user satisfaction. The level of quality of different attributes, i.e., library environment, collection, staff,  and  services  were  signifcantly  different  across  academic  discipline  of  respondents.The  study  will  be  helpful for libraries to improve their quality of services and increase user satisfaction.

1. INtRODUCtION  
University library exists to support the objectives  of its parent body. It is the backbone of the research  and teaching-learning process by offering variety of  extensive  services  and  access  to  a  wide  range  of  information  resources  both  in  print  and  electronic  format to academic community. The basic philosophy  of  the  library  is  to  meet  the  varied  information  needs of the users engaged in the academic pursuit  and  research.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  assess  the  quality  of  library  services  rendered  and  user  satisfaction because success of any library depends  upon  how  well  a  service  satisfies  the  demands  placed upon by the users. Hence, user satisfaction  and library service quality (LSQ) are ultimate goals  of  libraries  as  service  organisations. 
Service  quality  is  a  measure  of  how  well  the  service level delivered matches customer expectations.  Delivering  quality  service  means  conforming  to  customer expectations on a consistent basis1.User  
described as heart of university system. In the age  of  information  revolution,  university  library  has  to  play  a  vital  role  in  formal  education  environment  by  providing  its  advance  and  quality  services  to  students,  researchers,  and  faculties.  Moreover,  considering  the  dynamic  nature  of  library  services,  it  is  very  important  to  know  the  user  expectations  and  their  satisfaction  towards  library  services  so  that quality of library services can be improved and  ultimate objectives of the library are met. Therefore,  high level of service quality is vital for the success  of  organisations. 
1.1 Panjab  University,  Chandigarh  and  its  
Library  
Panjab University is one of the oldest universities in  India. There are 75 teaching and research departments  at  the  main  campus  located  at  Chandigarh.  The  University  has  been  ranked  number  one  in  India  as  per  the  Times  Higher  Education  (THE)  World’s  Top 400 University Ranking list for the year 2013- 
satisfaction is related to matching the expectations

Library has also access  to  approximately  5000+  online  full-text  journals  available  through  INDEST-consortium  and  UgC- INfONET  Digital  Library  consortium.  The  Library  is  fully  computerised  with  RfID  integrated  library  management  software  ‘SLIM  21’. 
2. LItERAtURE  REVIEW 
The study presents a brief overview of research  literature  reported  on  service  quality  and  user  satisfaction with academic libraries using SEVQUAL  scale. Hossain & Islam2  attempted to measure perceived  service  quality  associated  with  user  satisfaction  of  Dhaka  University  Library  with  the  help  of  modified  SERVQUAL instrument. It was found that the ‘library  hours’  is  the  only  service  item,  which  got  the  exclusive acceptance and ensured highest/optimum  satisfaction of the users, while other items were lower  than  expectation  scores,  indicating  dissatisfaction  to  library  users.  Omehia3,  et  al.,   examined  the  
bangladesh. He revealed that perceived services were  legging behind the desired service and attributes of  service quality fall short of user perception. Kassim9,  evaluated library’s performance by measuring users’  satisfaction with library services, infrastructure and  collection provided by a Public University Library in  Malaysia. The  study  revealed  that  on  the  average,  the  respondents  were  only  quite  satisfied  with  the  library services, infrastructure/place/space, collection/ information  of  the  library  as  a  whole.  The  results  also  showed  significant  differences  with  Library  services,  infrastructure/place/space,  and  libraries’  collection/information  among  the  respondents  of  the  3  faculties.  The  present  study  is  conducted  to  examine  the  quality  of  library  services  and  user  satisfaction  with  A.C.  Joshi  Library,  Panjab  University,  Chandigarh. 
3. AIM AND  O bJECtIVES 
The  prime  aim  of  the  study  is  to  assess  the  user satisfaction with the library services offered by  the  University  library.  Specific  objectives  were  to: (a) Identify the relationship between library services

located  in  different  sections  in  the  library.  It  was  observed  that  out  of  220  respondents,  77  (35  %)  respondents asked for any assistance only few times  in  a  semester,  followed  by  76  (34.5  %)  few  times  a  month,  followed  by  49  (22.3  %)  once  in  a  week  and 18 (8.2 %) respondents never asked assistance  from staff at the reference/ information desk. further  respondents‘ status-wise it was observed that most  of the graduate students consult the reference desk  few  times  in  a  semester.  Most  of  the  Pg   students  consulted  reference  desk  frequently. 
5.4  Frequency  of  Website  Visit 
The  frequency  to  access  information  for  their  learning  and  research  activities  though  library  webpages  on  the  university  website  is  shown  in   Table  4.  It  was  noted  that  more  than  half  of  the  total respondents visit the library webpages weekly  and once in a month. Only 51(23.2 %) respondents  are  using  library  web-pages  daily.

5.5  Difference  in  Library  Attributes  and  
Satisfaction 
One  sample  t-test  is  used  for  tests  of  the  sample  mean.  Table  5  shows  the  mean  score  of  attributes  of  library  services  and  user  satisfaction.  One sample t-test was applied to measure significant  difference in library attributes and user satisfaction  measured  on  the  Likert  scale.  Test  value  of  3  (Neutral)  is  considered  to  compare  for  significant  difference  and  it  was  observed  that  all  attributes  were  above  the  average  satisfaction  level. further  p value of 0 rejects the hypothesis that there is no  significant  difference  in  library  attributes  and  user  satisfaction  level. 
f  test/anova is a parametric test to investigate  the  difference  in  measured  values  of  an  attribute  among  three  or  more  independent  groups.  Here,  f   test  was  used  to  find  the  difference  in  library  attributes and user satisfaction among respondents  with different academic disciplines. The data in the  Table  6  reveals  the  analysis  of  variance  of  library  attributes  and  user  satisfaction  across  academic

disciplines  of  respondents.  There  is  difference  in  mean of library attributes and user satisfaction across  academic disciplines and significance value is less  than  0.05.  Null  hypothesis,  which  states  that  there  is  no  significant  difference  in  library  attributes  and  user  satisfaction  across  academic  disciplines  got  rejected  as  the  as  the  p  values  are  >0.05. 
Table 7 shows the analysis of variance of library  attributes  and  user  satisfaction  across  types  of  respondents. The f  values of user satisfaction (3.655,  significance = 0.027). The null hypothesis that there  is  no  significant  difference  in  user  satisfaction  got  rejected  as  the  p  value  is  >0.05.  Hence  there  is  significant difference in means of user satisfaction.  No difference was noted in library attributes as the  p  value  is  >0.05.  
Correlation analysis is used to determine whether  the values of 2 variables have relationship. As per the  results of Table 8, the correlation coefficient values  of  user  satisfaction  and  library  service  attributes  are significant positively correlated at p<0.01 level.  Thus the null  hypothesis that there is no correlation  among  service  quality  attributes  got  rejected. 
Multiple regression analysis is a useful technique  used  to  analyse  the  relationship  between  a  single  dependent and several independent variables. Multiple  regression  analysis  was  employed  to  examine  the  impact  of  independent  library  attributes  on  user  satisfaction as dependent variable. It can be noted  from  the  results  of  Table  9,  there  is  a  significant  relationship  between  the  four  library  attributes  and  level  of  user  satisfaction  (f=19.11,  significance  of  F<0.001). Moreover, the library attributes explain a  considerable proportion of the variance in the level  of user satisfaction, 26.2 % as indicated by R2 value  and adjusted R2 of 24.9 %. Library environment (β=  0.501,  p=  0.000)  and  library  services  (β=  0.367,  p=0.003)  were  found  the  significant  predictors  of  user satisfaction, while the other 2 library attributes  do  not  impact  the  user  satisfaction  significantly.   Variance  inflation  factor  VIf   values  vary  from  1.53  to 2.031, which is much lower than threshold of 10,  indicating  the  lack  of  multicollinearity  (degree  at

which a construct can explained by other construct  in the regression analysis) among constructs. Thus  the  null  hypothesis  that  library  attributes  have  no  significant  positive  impact  on  user  satisfaction  got  rejected as t-value of library environment and library  services  attributes  is  significant  at  0.01  level. 5.6  Helpfullness  of  Library  Services 
Table 10 indicates that majority of respondents  i.e.,  71.49  %  were  of  the  view  that  library  service  attributes are helpful towards their academic success  whereas,  only  3.64  %  respondents  given  negative  responses  i.e.,  library  service  attributes  are  not  helpful towards their academic success, rest 24.87 %  respondents  were  not  sure  about  helpfulness  of  library  service  attributes  towards  their  academic  success  which  also  indicates  that  either  they  don’t  know much about the library service attributes or not  visiting the library or are rarely visiting they library  or  never  utilised  library  resources  and  service. 
6. FINDINGS AND  CONCLUSIONS

across users of different streams. It was also noted  that  the  status  of  students  has  no  association  with  library attributes except the significant difference in  their  satisfaction  level.  It  was  also  observed  that  that majority of the respondents i.e., 71.49 % of the  opinion  that  library  attributes  are  helpful  towards  their  academic  success. 
The proposed hypotheses were based on previous  research studies and evidences shown in the literature,  it  was  not  possible  to  explain  relationships  among  the  variables  of  the  study.  Hence,  the  findings  of  the  study  were  not  an  indication  for  explaining  relationships among variables of library service quality.  further research can be carried out across important  attributes  of  academic  community  with  different  characteristics  and  including  other  departmental  libraries  in  the  university  library  system.  However  taking a sample large enough for significant results  must  be  considered,  when  carrying  out  such  study  for  a  higher  level  of  analysis.
