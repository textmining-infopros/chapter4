The aim of this study is to examine the time lag between the receipt of paper and its subsequent  publication in the journal, the structure of the IPR literature, type of documents cited by the papers and  identifcation of core journals in the feld of IPR using Bradford’s law. The study also identifes the place of  origin of the cited journals and the disciplines with which these dealt. The analysis indicates that the average  time lag between receipt and its consequent publication is about 4 months. Highest number of papers is  published in the sub-discipline of intellectual property rights and its related aspects. Nearly 40 journals  constitute the core of the cited journals. Most of the cited journals are published from USA, UK and India.  It is observed that most of the cited journals belong to the disciplines of law, economics and management.

1.  IntRoduCtIon 
Journal of Intellectual Property Rights (JIPR) , a  peer reviewed bi-monthly journal, was started in 1996  by CSIR-National Institute of Science Communication  and  Information  Resources  (CSIR-NISCAIR),  New  Delhi. It was the first journal in the area of Intellectual  Property Rights (IPR) from India. The main objectives  of  this  journal  are:  (i)  to  enhance  IPR  related  communication among policy makers, organisational  agents,  academics,  and  managers  for  the  critical  understanding and research on intellectual property;  and  (ii)  to  promote  the  development  of  this  newly  cultivated  research  field.  The  journal  publishes  contributed and invited research articles, case studies,   laws and reviews on different aspects of IPR, newly  emerging  trends,  policies  and  treaties  adopted  at  national and international level,  technical notes on  current  IPR  issues,  national  and  international  IPR  related  hot  topics,  book  reviews,  and  conference  reports.    At  present  the  journal  is  abstracted  &  indexed by Scopus, EBSCO host Electronic Journals  Services  (EJS),  Directory  of  Open  Access  Journal  (DOAJ),  Library  and  Information  Science Abstracts  Database  (LISA).  
National  Bureau  of  Plant  Genetic  Resources  (New  Delhi)  has  included  14  articles  from  various  issues  of  the  journal  as  the  study  material  for  its  course  PGS-503  on  intellectual  property  and  its  management  in  agriculture.  Jawaharlal  Nehru  University's  MPhil/PhD's  foundation  course  on  IPR  also  has  included  some  articles  from  the  journal  as  essential  reading  material.    
In  an  earlier  study,  Garg  &  Anjana1 analysed  papers  published  in  the  Journal  of  Intellectual  Property Rights  since its inception in 1996 up to 2012  and  found  that  the  inflow  of  papers  has  increased  considerably  during  the  period  of  study,  indicating  its  popularity  among  the  scientific  community  as  well  as  the  policy  makers.  About  three-fourth  of  the papers published in the journal originated from  India and the rest from abroad. Among papers from  abroad, US was the largest contributor. Among the  performing  sectors,  academic  institutions  were  the  largest contributors to the journal followed by research  institutions of the Council of Scientific and Industrial  Research  (CSIR).  Several  prolific  institutions  and  authors  were  also  from  CSIR.  However,  this  study  did  not  examine  the  time  lag  between  receipt  and

consequent publication of the papers in the journal,  types  of  documents  cited  by  the  articles  published  in  the  journal,  and  country  of  origin  and  discipline  of  the  various  cited  journals.  The  present  study  is  an attempt to fill these gaps and thus an extension  of  the  above  quoted  study.  
2.  lIteRAtuRe  RevIew 
Studies  relating  to  the  citations  appended  to  different journals are reported by Mete & Deshmukh2 who  analysed  1824  references  appended  to  202  articles published in Annals of Library Science and  Documentation   during  1984-1993.  They  found  that  the  journals  were  the  most  cited  literature  in  the  area of library and information studies (LIS). Similar,  results  were  obtained  by  Deshmukh3   in  another  study  for  articles  published  in  Annals  of  Library  and  Information  Studies   during  1997-2010.  They  also  found  that  self  citations  to  the  journal  were  highest. Dixit & Katore4   examined  3521  references  appended  to  327  articles  published  in  the Journal  of Indian Society for Cotton Improvement Research also  found  that  journals  were  cited  more  than  any  other document type and also the source journal is  ranked  first  among  all  the  cited  journals.  However,  there  is  no  study  reported  which  deals  with  the  citations appended to Journal of Intellectual Property  Rights.

The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
Examine the time lag in months between receipt  of  paper  and  its  consequent  publication  in  the  journal  during  1996-2014 
Examine  the  structure  of  intellectual  property  right literature as seen by the content analysis  of papers published in the journal during 1996- 2014 
Identify types of sources, cited by the published  papers  during  1996-2012 
Examine the different journals that were cited in  
(www.scimagojr.com) and (https://www.worldcat.org)  respectively.  The  time  lag  between  receipt  of  the  paper  and  its  subsequent  date  of  publication  was  also recorded for each publication for 1996-2014. A  database  was  created  in  MS  Excel  for  analysis.  
5.  Results And dIsCussIons 
5.1  time  tag  between  Receiving  of  Paper  and  
Publication 
There are several indicators to judge the quality  of  a  journal,  such  as  its  timely  publication,  regular  schedule  of  publication,  inclusion  in  indexing  and  abstracting  services,  particularly  in  the  Web  of  Science  of  the  Thomson  Reuters  (USA).  Besides  these the time lag between receipt and its consequent  publication  is  also  a  measure  of  the  quality  of  a  journal.  
Table  1  presents  the  data  for  the  receipt  and  consequent  publication  of  593  articles  appeared  in  volume  6  (2001)  to  volume  19  (2014)  as  the  data  for  1996-2000  has  not  been  provided  in  the  published papers. It indicates that the average time  between  receipt  of  the  paper  and  its  publication  is  about 3.6 months.

4.  Methodology 
The  source  journal  is  an  open  access  journal,  available on the CSIR-NISCAIR website (http://nopr. niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/45). Each issue of the  journal,  from  volume  1(1996)  to  volume  17(2012),  was  scanned  for  the  types  of  references  cited  in  the  article  and  name  of  the  journals  cited.

in  the  journal  during  2001-2014,  the  time  gap  for  183  (31  %)  papers  was  more  than  the  average.  Among all the years, the time gap between receipt  of  the  paper  and  its  publication  was  more  than  average  for  2002,  2004,  2012  and  2013.  It  was  highest  for  the  year  2013.  Number  of  papers  with  time  lag  more  than  four  months  was  also  highest  for  2013  and  2012.  Authors  examined  the  reason  for  a  large  number  of  papers  with  time  lag  more  than  four  months  in  receipt  and  publication  of  the  papers for these years. It was found that the delay  in  most  cases  was  on  the  part  of  authors  and  reviewers.  Bjork  &  Solomon5   examined  the  time  lag  in  publishing  in  135  peer  reviewed  journals  in  different fields of science, technology and medicine  (STM),  social  sciences  and  humanities.  Authors  found  that  the  longest  time  delay  (18  months)  was  in  the  discipline  of  business  and  economics  and  shortest in STM. This indicates that the time lag in  publishing papers in Journal of Intellectual Property  Rights   is  much  less  as  compared  to  the  discipline  of  business  and  economics.  This  also  reflects  on  the  better  quality  of  the  journal.  
5.2 structure  of  IPR literature 
Using the content analysis of papers published  in  the  journal  during  1996-2014  authors  examined  the  structure  of  the  IPR  literature.    The  papers  published  in  the  journal  can  be  broadly  classified  into six different sub-fields of IPR. These fields are  measurement of patenting activity in different fields  of  science  and  technology;  patent  infringement;  copyright  protection  and  various  laws  enacted  for  the  same;  various  aspects  of  trademark  laws;  geographical indications; impact of IPR at different  levels,  IPR  management,  and  intellectual  property  protection  at  national  and  international  level.  The  highest  number  of  papers  (164)  were  published  in  the sub-discipline of intellectual property rights and  related  aspects  followed  by  patent  and  patenting  76  papers,  measurement  of  patenting  activity  56  papers closely followed by copyright laws 54 papers,  geographical indications 24 papers and trade mark  laws  19  papers.  About  200  papers  could  not  be  classified into these six categories and were treated  as  miscellaneous.      
5.3 different types  of sources  Cited  by  
Published Articles 
Scientists  cite  different  types  of  documents  to  justify  their  research  results  in  his/her  scientific  communication.  These  can  be  books,  conference  papers, theses, websites, journals, etc. An analysis  of  data  in  the  present  study  indicates  that  605  papers  published  during  1996-2012  cited  13,738  document  sources  (Table  2).  The  average  rate  of  documents cited was 23 per article. The distribution  of different types of sources cited is given in Table  
438 
2.  Data  presented  in  Table  2  indicates  that  the  citation of websites ranked first in order of citations  followed  by  case  laws  and  journal  papers.  These  three  types  of  sources  constituted  about  three- fourth  of  citations  and  the  rest  one-fourth  were  books,  conference  papers  and  patents.  In  studies  reported in literature in other areas, journal articles  are  commonly  ranked  first.  As  the  field  of  IPR  is  different  from  other  fields  here  case  laws  are  also  cited prominently. Recently novel information is also  available on websites and hence the citation of web  links  topped  the  list  of  cited  documents.

5.4  Bradford’s law  of scattering  and  
Identification  of  Cited  Core journals  
During  1996-2012  the  journal  published  605  papers  which  cited  13,738  document  sources.  Of  these, 3365 (25.4%) citations were of journal articles.  These  journal  articles  were  scattered  among  910  journal  titles  published  from  different  parts  of  the  globe  and  covered  different  subjects.  Using  the  Bradford’s law of scattering6  authors identified core  journals  in  the  field  of  IPR.  The  law  describes  a  quantitative  relationship  between  the  journals  and  the  papers  they  publish.  Two  widely  recognised  formulations of the law are: (i) the verbal formulation,  derived  from  the  verbal  statement  of  Bradford’s  conclusions,  and  (ii)  the  graphical  formulation,  derived from the graph of distribution of papers over  periodicals.  According  to  verbal  formulation  of  the  law  “If  scientific  periodicals  are  arranged  in  order  of  decreasing  productivity  of  articles  on  a  given  subject, they may be divided into three parts, each  containing  the  same  number  of  articles:  (a)  a  core  or nucleus of journals on the subject, relatively few  in  number,  that  produces  approximately  one-third  of  all  the  articles,  (b)  a  second  or  middle  zone,  containing the same number of articles as the first,  but  a  greater  number  of  journals,  and  (c)  a  third  zone,  containing  the  same  number  of  articles  as  the  second,  but  a  still  greater  number  of  journals’.  Based  on  this,  Bradford  stated  that  the  number  of  periodicals in the nucleus and succeeding zones will  be 1: n: n2.  The graphical formulation is obtained by

GARG, et al.: JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF CITED REFERENCES 
plotting  a  curve  in  a  plane  where  coordinates  are  the cumulative number of articles (in the y-axis) and  the  logarithm  of  the  cumulative  number  of  journals  of  the  collection  (in  the  x-axis),  where  journals  are  cumulated from most to least productive. The curve  has  invariably  an  ascending  shape  which  after  a  certain  point,  approaches  to  a  straight  line.  
To apply the Bradford’s law of scattering in the  present  study,  a  list  of  journals  and  the  number  of  articles  published  in  each  was  prepared.  Table  3  shows  the  scatter  of  articles  in  journals.

For  testing  the  applicability  of  the  law,  the  3365  articles  were  divided  into  three  zones.  In  the  present data set 40 journals published 1122 articles,  next  157  journals  published  905  articles,  and  in  the next zone 753 journals published 1338 articles.  This  indicates  that  almost  one  third  of  the  articles  have  been  published  in  each  zone. The  reason  for  choosing three zones was that the percentage error  in distribution of articles, among the three zones is  least (calculations shown below$). These identified  zones  form  a  geometric  series  approximately  in  the  form  1:  n:  n 
2.  Here,  the  observed  distribution  is  40:157:753  =  910  and  expected  distribution  is  40:40*4.35:40*(4.35)2.  Here,  4.35  is  the  average  of  the  Bradford’s  multiplier  obtained  by  dividing  the  number  of  journal  titles  of  a  particular  zone  by  its  preceding  zone  (here  157/40  =  3.9)  and  (753/157=  4.8).  
Table  4  provides  Bradford  zones  and  their  calculations for research output in IPR during 1996- 2012. Journals in the first zone constitute the core  journals  of  the  field  of  IPR.  Figure  1  depicts  the  Bradford’s  bibliograph.  This  indicates  that  there  is  no  ‘Groos  Droop’  which  shows  completeness  of  the bibliography, i.e., the field of IPR has matured.  Table  5  lists  core  journals  of  the  field  of  IPR.  Of

5.5 distribution  of  Cited journals  by  
disciplines 
The 910 journals that were cited during 1996-2012  belonged  to  20  disciplines  of  science,  technology,  business  studies,  management,  law,  intellectual  property law and trade. Table 6 shows the distribution  of cited journals by disciplines in descending order  of  citations.  
Table  6  indicates  that  the  highest  number  of  cited journals were from the discipline of law, which  constituted  about  one-third  (31.3  %)  of  all  cited  journals. The journals from the discipline of economics  and  business  studies  and  management  together  constituted  about  16  %  of  all  cited  journals.  Rest  (52.7 %) journals were from other 17 disciplines. This  indicates that the journals from the disciplines of law,  economics  and  business  studies  and  management  are cited heavily by the researchers working in the  field of IPR and related issues. This is because the  roots  of  IPR  research  lies  in  these  disciplines.

5.6  Country  of origin  of  Cited journals 
An  analysis  of  data  of  the  910  journals  cited  by  the  researchers  indicates  that  these  journals  originated  from  32  different  countries  of  the  globe  is  shown  in  Table  7.  Of  these,  highest  number  of  cited  journals  originated  from  the  USA  followed  by  journals from the UK and India, the host country of  the journal. The proportion of journals originating from  these  countries  was  about  76  %  of  the  total  cited  journals.  Remaining  24  %  cited  journals  originated  from other 29 countries. Among them the Netherlands  topped  the  list.  One  of  the  possible  reasons  for  large number of cited journals from the US may be

The analysis of data indicates that the  Journal of  Intellectual Property Rights  is becoming a promising  journal as about one fourth of the articles published  in  the  journal  are  from  abroad1.  The  time  gap  between  receipt  of  articles  and  their  consequent  publication  is  about  four  months  and  much  less  than  the  time  lag  in  publishing  of  papers  in  the  discipline  of  business  and  economics.  Based  on  the  content  analysis  of  the  papers  published  it  is  observed that the field of IPR and its management  is  multidisciplinary  and  highly  fragmented.  
Based  on  the  pattern  of  citation  of  different  types  of  document  sources  it  indicates  that  three  fourth  of  these  were  constituted  by  websites,  case  laws  and  journal  articles;  share  of  each  being  almost  equal.  Reference  analysis  of  cited  journals  indicates  that  about  one-third  of  the  cited  journals  were  from  40  journals  only  and  rest  two  third  were scattered over 870 journals. Analysis of cited  journals  by  discipline  indicates  that  the  field  of  IPR  research  integrates  knowledge  mainly  from  law,  economics  and  business  and  management  as  a  large  number  of  cited  journals  were  from  these  three  fields.  Journals  originating  from  the  US  were  referred  highest  number  of  times.
