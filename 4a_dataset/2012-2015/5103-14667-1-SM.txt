The paper focuses on the study of usage of e-resources available through UGC-INFONET Digital  Library Consortium by University of Pune users. The objective is to fnd trends in usage of e-resources  and  which  e-resources  are  used  to  the  maximum. To  study  the  usage  trends  a  usage  statistics  of  13  full-text databases  during  2007-2012 were collected from UGC-INFONET website. The study reveals  that  usage  of  e-resources  is  increasing.  More  users  are  getting  awareness  of  e-resources  and  using  e-databases. Users from Chemistry feld are more active in using e-databases. Some databases contain  very less titles, but the usage of these databases iss very high. Subject specifc databases are highly  used  than  multi-subject  databases. Titles-wise  usage  study  is  useful  for  effective  planning  and  taking  important  decision  on  subscription  of  databases. This  usage  study  is  useful  for  LIS  professionals  for  fnding important e-journals and databases for proper implementation of funds.

1. INTrOdUCTION 
Today  electronic  information  (e-information)  is  available  enormously  and  accessible  due  to  developments  in  publishing  industry  and  user  are  preferring  e-information  due  to  24x7  availability  at  their  desk  as  well  as  easy  flexible  search  of  e-databases.  Libraries  are  spending  huge  amount  of  money  for  subscribing  databases  such  as  full- text  e-journals,  e-books,  reference  materials  and  archiving back-sets of journals. Therefore, it becomes  important  to  check  usage  of  e-resources.  Librarian  conducted  this  type  of  studies  for  print  collection  for long time using data generated and collected by  the  library  during  various  transactions.  This  study  may  be  useful  to  identify  usage  pattern,  to  help  digital collection development, and  to get additional  funds  from  university  authorities.

Jayakar Library has developed e-resource portal  which lists all e-resources with hyperlink for creating  awareness  about  e-resources.  The  description  of  each  resource  is  provided  so  that  user  can  find  whether  the  resource  is  useful  to  them  or  not.  
3.   LITE rATUrE rEvIEw 
There are number of studies conducted on usage  studies  and  summarised  in  many  earlier  studies.  However, this study presents the findings of studies  mainly  on  UGC-INFONET  e-resource. 
Chand & Arora2   in  their  study  found  that  there  has  been  a  qualitative  increase  in  overall  usage,  but  use  is  also  dependent  on  a  high-bandwidth  connection.  
Singh3,  et  al.,  revealed  that  while  there  was  an  increase  in  the  usage  of  the  resources  of  most  of  the  publishers  inspite  of  certain  problems  of  accessibility,  resources  of  some  of  the  publishers  were  under-utilised.  
A  study  conducted  by  bhatt4   determined  the  needs of research scholars and faculty members of  University of Delhi in History and Political Science,   and  finds  out  how  far  their  information  needs  are  fulfilled by the information resources available through  UGC-INFONET  Digital  Library  Consortium.  
Walmiki5,  et  al.,   reveal  that  comparatively  science  faculty  uses  consortium  resources  more  frequently  than  those  belong  to  Social  Sciences  and  Humanities.  
Mukherjee & Kumar6  in their study reveal that,  there is demand for more e-journals titles although a  substaintial number of users (61.90 %) are satisfied  with  the  existing  model  of  UGC-INFONET. 
Pradhan7, et al.,  revealed that, COUNTER and  SUSHI  standards  have  potential  to  ease  the  work  of  maintaining  usage  statistics.  It  also  gives  the  implication  of  SUSHI  for  creating  usage  statistics  portal  at  INFLIbNET  center.

LONDHE AND DESHPANDE: USAGE  S TUDy OF  UGC-INFONET E- RESOURCES AT  U NIVERSITy OF  P UNE 
bhatt & Rana8, in their study revealed that academic  staff  was  using  many  types  of  e-resources.  
Suseela9  emphasised the necessity of evaluating  the  library  resources  in  terms  of  their  quality,  cost  benefit, and usefulness. It highlighted the application  of usage reports by the university library in decision  making  during  renewals/subscriptions.  
4.  ObJECTIvES 
The present study is conducted for the following  specific  objectives: 
• To  find  number  of  downloads/views,  and • To  find  popularity  of  publisher. 
5.  SCOPE ANd  LImITATIONS 
The present study covers usage study of full-text  journal databases available through UGC-INFONET  consortia  having  more  than  25  titles.  The  period  selected for the study is 2007-2012. Sufficient usage  data of Science Direct  database was not available,  therefore  it  has  not  been  covered  in  this  study. 
6.    mET hOdOLOGy  
For the present study the usage data of e-resources  is  collected  from  e-resources  access  management  system provided by INFLIbNET Centre, Ahmadabad.  In case of few databases the complete usage data  is  not  available  in  this  system.  
Usage  is  being  collected  on  regular  intervals/  as  and  when  available  on  the  publisher’s  website  The  usage  statistics  are:  
• Based on the automated usage reports provided  
by  the  publishers  on  the  web  
• Counted  on  the  basis  of  number  of  full-text  
downloads  or  views  (both  as  HTML  or  PDF)  
in  case  of  e-journals  
• Number of records viewed or searches in case  
of  bibliographic-databases  
• For SciFinder  Scholar   counted  as  the  number  
of  activities  or  SSM  activities  
• For  JCCC  based  on  the  number  of  hits. 
7.    dATA  A NALySIS 
The  collected  data  indicates  that  among  25  databases, except bibliographic-databases, only 14  full-text  databases  are  having  more  than  25  tiles.  In this study, 13 databases were selected for study  because  one  full-text  database  ‘ScienceDirect’  is  recently  subscribed  therefore  sufficient  usage  data  is  not  available  (Table  2).

were  39,861.  From  this  database  37  full-text  titles  were  subscribed.  The  average  downloads  per  title  per  year  were  1077.  Considering  this  fact,  it  could  be concluded that usage of this database was very  high. year 2008 shows decrease in downloads/views,  due to unavailability of data for month of November  and  December  from  INFLIbNET  (Table  3). 
7.1.2  Royal  Society  of  Chemistry  (RSC) 
    The  total  downloads/view  during  2007-2012  were 46,282 and average download/views per year  were  7713.  From  this  database    29  full-text  titles  were  subscribed,  The  average  downloads/views  per  title  per  year  were  265.  Considering  this  fact  as  compared  to  ACS  the  usage  of  RSC  was  very  low,  and  less  number  of  users  were  using  this  database.  This  also  shows  that  ACS  was  more  popular among chemistry subject users. There was  increase  in  usage  in  2012  (Table  4).

9.  CONCLUSIONS 
Modern  libraries  are  subscribing  to  more  e-resources. It appears that lot of funds are utilised  on  subscribing  these  e-resources  therefore,  it  is  important  to  find  the  usage  of  these  resources.  In  the  University  of  Pune,  usage  of  e-resources  is  increasing  day-by-day.  Users  from  chemistry  field  are  more  active  in  using  e-databases  that  may  be  due  to  more  research  is  on-going  in  Chemistry.  Some  databases  contain  very  less  titles,  but  the  usage  of  these  databases  were  very  high.  Subject  specific databases are highly used than multi subject  databases. In depth study of usage is not possible  due  to  unavailability  of  titles-wise  usage  data.
