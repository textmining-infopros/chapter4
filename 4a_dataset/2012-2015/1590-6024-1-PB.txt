ABSTRACT
This paper presents the results of an analysis of usage reports of ebrary database. The five indicators
(pages viewed, pages copied, pages printed, unique documents usage, and user sessions) were identified
to determine the extend of ebrary usage by 18 government and private institutions in the UAE based on their
counter reports. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows significant difference in the average of these
indicators among the 18 institutions in the UAE. Results of the study indicate that governments' institutions
outperformed private institutions in all these indicators and the T-test confirmed the same. In general, the study
found ebrary use is relatively low and there was no annual growth in both government and private institutions.
The study found that a large number of surveyed institutions do not fully utilise ebrary services as expected.
There is a need for aggressively promotion about the use of electronic resources among the faculty members
and students through appropriate training, workshops and marketing activities in all these institutions.
Keywords: Electronic books, United Arab Emirates, ebrary, ANOVA

1. INTRODUCTION
Throughout the history, evidences prove that leathers,
stones, bones, clay, metals, and leaves, etc., have been
used by human beings to record and store information
and knowledge1. However, these objects were replaced by
papers, centuries ago, due to industrial revolution in
general and printing industries in particular. The printing
industries made significant changes for storing and
preserving information and knowledge as in case of
printed books. Since then the printed books had served
as the most reliable and popular container for storing and
preserving information and knowledge. However, the printed
books format was dramatically changed in 1990s due to
the development of information and communication
technology (ICT) which resulted in the evolution of
e-books2,3. Rao4 believes that e-book is the most important
development in the world of literature after Gutenberg.
E-book can be defined as a published book in the
electronic form (e-form). The e-form includes CD-ROMs,
web-based resources, and special devices such as
personal digital assistants (PDA) and cell phones3. From
the day of its introduction, libraries realised the
importance of e-books and made them as part of their
collection development. Libraries acquire e-books through

subscription or purchase license polices and provide
them to the users via library OPAC, websites, etc.5
At least for the past 13 years, libraries in the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) have been providing e-books to
users as an integrated source of library collection through
online databases, library websites or as portable devices
such as e-readers or stand alone products like CD-ROMs
and DVDs. Some current well-known and popular e-books
databases in the UAE are ebrary, NetLibrary, Safari,
Ebook library, informaworld, Books@Ovid, MyiLibrary,
Oxford Reference Online, and Oxford Scholarship Online.
As part of library collection, e-books save time,
space, and effort and are used more than printed books.
They also allow multi-user access and use concurrently
by users of geographically distributed environment.
However, as pointed by Al, Soydal & Tonta6, libraries need
to investigate the trends and choices of users for making
an effective e-books collection policy development and
management.
This paper addresses some of these issues by
exploring the use of e-books in the ebrary database by
users of 18 government and private institutions in the UAE
during a period of eight years from 2003 to 2010. Findings

of the study would help academic libraries in the UAE to
better understand the nature of e-books' usage by the
faculty members and students, manage effectively
electronic resources (e-resources), and make a better
negotiation with database vendors and agents.

2. EBRARY: BRIEF OVERVIEW
ebrary was established in 1999 by Christopher
Warnock and Kevin Sayar in Palo Alto, California. ebrary
is an online digital library with full-text collection of over
70,000 scholarly e-books. The database contains books,
journals, magazines, maps, and other publications in the
field of Business, Economics, Computers, Technology
and Engineering, Humanities, Life and Physical Science,
and Social and Behavioral Sciences from over 500
publishers. ebrary currently has more than 4,500 library
customers around the world serving more than 19.2
million end-users. ebrary was privately held until it was
acquired by ProQuest in 20117,8,9.

3. REVIEW OF RELATED STUDIES
Many studies have assessed and evaluated the usage
of e-books in different countries. The review of literature
shows that researchers investigating the usage of
e-books have used various methods and techniques to
collect data such as counter reports6,10 observation and
interview5, and questionnaire tool11.
In their analysis of e-book database use by students and
faculty members of Hacettepe University libraries in Turkey,
Al, Soydal and Tonta6 used counter reports to investigate the
trends and choices of users to be able to build an effective
policy for collection development and management. The
researchers were able to identify the most frequently used
e-book titles by the users in each Library of Congress (LC)
subject class. E-books on medicine were used most often,
followed by books on education and language and literature.
A small number of e-books in each subject class satisfied
half of the demand, while an overwhelming majority of e-book
titles were never used.
At the University of Liverpool, Bucknell10 also used
counter report to examine the usage of Springer e-book
collection to find out how usage of e-books is influenced
by subject area, date of publication and the length of time.
The study found that all but one of the subject areas have
been well used, the number of unused titles continues to
diminish each year; older titles continue to attract
significant usage and the cost-per-use is relatively low.
Hernon5, et al. used observation and interview method
to examine e-books search behaviour and use patterns of
undergraduate students in economics, literature and
nursing. Findings shows that economics students used
current mono figures; literature students checked literary
96

dictionaries and literary criticisms; while nursing majors
limited their search and reading to reference sources.
By using an online survey in a British academic
library, Abdullah and Gibb11 found that 57 per cent of 1372
respondents have low e-book awareness and usage. The
authors urged academic libraries to actively and
attractively take initiation to promote the e-books
awareness and usage through websites, brochures,
posters, training sessions, and workshops.
Despite the existence of many advantages of e-books,
some studies showed that their usage can be very
challenging. In an article, Mikki & Stangeland12 describes
how users find e-books challenging to read because of their
user interfaces, restrictions imposed on users to use and
specific reading devices required due to proprietary file
formats. Similarly, Soule13 highlighted issues related to
technology, readability, access, borrowing, and the level of
knowledge that hindering the use of e-books. She believes
that there is a need to redefine the concept of e-book.
Reviewing 10 years experience of e-books at the University
of Auckland Library, Mincic-Obradovic14 believes that
e-books do not satisfy students' needs because publishers
keep textbooks in print format and only offer only general
reference titles and supplementary collections in e-format.
Meanwhile, the review of the literature showed a
dearth of researches concerning the issues related to
e-books in the UAE. This paper studied the usage of
e-books in the UAE particularly explored the differences
between government and private institutions with regard to
the ebrary usage. It is expected that the findings of the
study would help in improving the usage of electronic
resources in the UAE.

4. METHODOLOGY
The main purpose of this paper is to explore the usage
of e-books. Specifically, the study surveyed 18
government and private institutions who are subscribing to
ebrary database in the UAE (Table 1). The study is based
on ebrary usage data reports generated from ebrary
database. The reports of each university include monthly
and annual statistics starting from the starting year of
subscription up to December 2010. The counter statistics
reports are obtained from TeckKnowledge, the ebrary
agent in Dubai. Previously related studies have used
similar reports to assess the usage of e-books in different
countries6,10,14. Based on these reports, five indicators
were identified and analysed to determine the extent of
ebrary usage. These five indicators are: Number of pages
viewed, number of pages copied, number of pages
printed, number of unique documents usage, and number
of user sessions users logged into. Therefore, the paper
formulated the following two research hypotheses and
tested in this study:
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(2)

(a) There is no significant difference among the
institutions in the UAE, in regard to the overall average
number of pages viewed, pages copied, pages printed,
the usage of unique document, and number of sessions
logged into the ebrary database.
(b) There is no significant difference between government
and private institutions in the UAE in regard to the overall
average number of pages viewed, pages copied, pages
printed, the usage of unique documents, and number of
sessions logged into the ebrary database.
ANOVA, and independent T-test were to verify the
above hypotheses. Also used time-series technique to
analyse the number of unique documents used by the
students and faculty members of six institutions.

5. DATA ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this study, ebrary database usage by faculties,
students, and other users of government and private
institutions in the UAE were focused. The analysis is
based on counter usage reports generated from the
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(2)

ebrary database. The data includes each of the academic
institution's monthly and annual usage figures of ebrary
covering starting year of subscription until December
2010.
Table 2 summarises the averages and the standard
deviations of ebrary usage indictors. From these
indicators it was noticed that the government institutions
out perform private institutions in all the indicators with
double or sometime triple of its usage number. For
instance the number of user sessions on an average is
about 215 with a standard deviation of 263.625 in Table 2,
while it is about 125 (almost half) users with a standard
deviation of 178.441 for the private institutions.

After testing the first hypothesis, the ANOVA table
(Table 3) shows a very small p-value (significance is
almost close to zero) for all of the indicators (pages
viewed, pages copied, pages printed, and the usage of
unique document). This indicates that there is significant
difference in the average number of pages viewed, copied,
printed, and the usage of unique document between the
institutions in UAE.
For testing the second hypothesis, 2-independent
variables were used for T-test for testing different
indicators (pages viewed, pages copied, pages printed,
and the usage of unique document) and presented data in
Table 4. The p-values of the indicators; average number of
pages printed and the average number of unique
documents used by students and faculties are almost
zero (p-value of overall pages = 0.001 and it is zero for all
the other indicators). This indicates that there is
significant difference between the government and private
universities. This is expected due to lack of facilities,
printers, and papers in private institutions compared to
government institutions.
The large p-values for the other two indicators; the
average number of pages copies (p-value = 0.774) and the
average number of pages viewed (0.107); indicate that
there is no significant difference between the government
and the private institutions in these issues. This is also
logical due to the availability of advanced computers and
storage devices such as external hard-disk, pen/thumdrive, etc., with students and faculty members in both
government and private institutions.

To further analyse the number of unique documents
usage by the students and faculty members, a Time
series analysis for this indicator of each institution was
conducted. From the Time series plots, six noticeable
cases were identified and summarised (Fig. 1). The first
two of these cases are Zayed University (Panel ‘a’ of
Fig.1) and UAE University (Panel ‘b’ of Figure 1) which are
considered as excellent examples of the usage of unique
documents. The next two institutions are the Higher
Colleges of Technology (Panel ‘c’ of Fig. 1) and the
American University in Dubai (Panel ‘d’ of Fig. 1) which
are considered as good examples. While the last two
institutions are considered as not so good examples, and
these institutions are Al-Hosn University (Panel ‘e’ of
Fig. 1) and Al-Ain University of Science and Technology
(Panel ‘f’ of Fig. 1). The following para figures will explain
the cases of these institutions separately.
Panel ‘a’: It was observed that Zayed University started its
subscription in 2003 with few number of users. The
university gradually grew during the following years, at the
same time the number of ebrary users also increased
significantly. As it can be observed from the panel ‘a’ of
Fig. 1, the fluctuation after 2008 is around 600 per year
and the trend is going up with the time.
Panel ‘b’: UAEU started its subscription with around 400
users in 2005. After 2008 that number reached around 900
users during the normal semesters. However, this number
fall-down to about 200 users during the summer vacation.
This big downfall of members in the latest years might be
due to the moving of the UAEU form teaching university
into research university.

Panel ‘c’: HCT since the beginning of its subscription, the
number of users was fluctuating around 600 users per
year. This fluctuation continued till 2010, which indicates
that the HCT organises stable orientation programmes
and formulated good policies in regards to the use of eresources in research and teaching activities.
Panel ‘d’: AUD started its subscription with an acceptable
number of users in 2004. However, this number did not
change significantly until 2009. After that, the pattern of
ebrary database usage changed dramatically to reach
almost 500 users per year. This may be due to the new
changes and guidance of the Ministry of Higher Education
towards research in the UAE.
Panel ‘e’: HU starts from very low level of users in
2006, and then it started to improve slowly in followings
years to reach almost 250 users per year. Unfortunately,
these figures indicate that this university as a member of
private institutions does not apply a stable orientation
programs and policies with regard to the use of eresources in research and teaching activities.
Panel ‘f’: AAU has almost nil users of ebrary
database. However, a little fluctuation was observed
around 50 users in the curve of this university (Panel ‘f’,
Fig. 1). This might be due to the training and workshops
conducted by the AAU library each semester to train the
students and faculties on how to use e-resources.
The improvement of ebrary users in the UAE can be
seen during the last decade in terms of the number of
pages copied under usage of the ebrary database. This
improvement is summarised in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows the
number of pages copied which using the ebrary database
by the government and private institutions in the UAE from
2004-2010. From the figures it was noticed that the
number of pages copied increased dramatically from 2004
until 2007, and then this number started decreasing in a
noticeable way. This might be due to the revolution in
computer industry especially increasing the storage

spaces and corresponding tools. As shown in Fig. 3, the
average number of pages copied each month in both of
the private and government institutions increased in the
first 5 months of the year and gone down in the next 4
months and then went up during the last 3 months. This is
reasonable due to the summer vacation in the UAE in
which most of the locals and foreign residents leave the
country because these are extremely hot months in the
UAE.

6. CONCLUSIONS
Despite its advantages and contributions to the
collection development, the use of e-books remains a
challenging issue to academic libraries in the UAE. It is
evident that for the past eight years ebrary subscribers in
the UAE have not been able to fully utilise the services
provided by the ebrary database. This might be due to the
lack of marketing, training, and orientation programmes
that are needed to meet the cost-effective use of ebrary
among faculty members and students. Therefore,
government and private institutions in the UAE should
assess their needs to e-books and adopt a long term
strategic plan of marketing, training, orientation, and selfassessment to improve the usage of e-resources.
