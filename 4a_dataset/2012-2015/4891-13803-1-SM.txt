ABSTRACT 
  In this study, the publications of Odisha are collected from ISI  Web of Science  and quantitatively  analysed.  Total 14,899 items were retrieved for the period 1967-2011, and there was no publications  available from 1945-1966. From 1972, the publications grow steadily up to 1982 but after that the growth  is irregular, then rapidly growth is notices from 2006 onwards. Authors of State have collaborated with  most of the developed countries of the world. It is a good sign that the publications of new institutes are  increasing but publications of old colleges have decreased. The authors have published some of their  publications in high impact journals. Some areas which are priority to State such as clinical sciences,  geology, environmental sciences, marine sciences, and computer sciences are neglected.  
Keywords: ISI Web of Science, Odisha, high impact journals, impact factor, international collaboration,

1.  INTRODUCTION 
There is a remarkable growth in science &  technology (S&T) in India during last sixty years.  For sustainable growth, there must be research in  basic sciences and engineering, which improves the  conditions capabilities and opportunities for trained  scientists and engineers to pursue innovative research  and educate the next generation1. In India, due to  its diverse environment, the research should focus  the problems of different regions. The state Odisha  (formerly Orissa) is the ninth largest state by area  in India, and 11th  largest by population. The study  conducted by Gupta2  has recognised that Odisha  is a medium productivity state having 15th  rank  in S&T. It is rich in natural resources but under- developed. A large portion of state comes under  tropical climate where diseases like malaria, filaria,  and diarrohea are highly prevalent. The primary  source of income is agriculture but farmers face  challenges of uncertain climate. So there is a need  for region-based continuous research in S&T. 
2.  OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of this study are to:  
(i)  Analyse Odisha’s publications growth between  
1945-2011 
(ii)  Analyse its research priorities as reflected in  
its subject areas of publications 
(iii) Identify Odisha’s share in international collaborative  
papers with leading countries 
(iv) Analyse the publications growth of major state  
universities of Odisha, and 
(v)  Identify highly preferred journals for publications  
of the authors of the state. 
3.  METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCE 
In this study, publication data of the State  
indexed in Web of Science 
3 
 ( WOS) is used. The  
WOS  published by the company Thomson Reuters,  USA, is the online version of Science Citation Index  (SCI)-Expanded of Institute for Scientific Information  (ISI), Philadelphia. It covers over 12,000 world- 
wide high impact journals. It also includes open  
access journals and more than 150,000 conference  
proceedings. It has a standard journal selection  
policy for inclusion in the database. If a journal does

not follow the standard then it gets excluded from  the list of source journals for the database. Most  of the study relating to quality of S&T considers  the literature covered by WOS  as ‘mainstream  international’ due to its coverage of high impact  journals from all disciplines4,5. 
For retrieval of publications from Odisha, keywords  ‘ODISHA’ OR ‘ORISSA’ were used. It is noticed that  some records do not carry the name of state in  the address field. So to get most of the records,  besides above two keywords, the name of some  city or towns where an institute/research centre is  situated was taken as keywords (for example Cuttack,  Rourkela, Sambalpur, Mayurbhanj, Rayagada, etc).  All these selected keywords entered in the search  box and address field is selected for the period  1945-2011 to get the published items. 
4.  ANALYSIS 
4.1 Number of Publications 
Total 14,899 items retrieved from the database.  As per WOS , they are categorised as articles  (12,703), notes (1,387), proceedings paper (403),  letters (273), reviews (237), meeting abstracts (183),  and editorial (78). The records are quantitatively  analysed. In Table 1, articles are presented year  wise as per their year of publication in source titles.  First article found in the database is of the year  1967. No record is found for 1945-1966. It is found  that number is steadily increasing up to 1981 but  after that there is negative growth rate up to 1994.  Its growth again increased 2006 onwards (Fig. 1).  The 10 years of time between 1995-2005, the trend  sustained more or less steady. In Table 2, the list  of institutions having more than 40 publications are

highest number of publications. There are around  300 institutes/research stations who have published  at least one paper.  
4.2 Subject Areas of Research 
The papers are categorised as per WOS  subject  category. In Table 3, the number of publications in  major subjects is presented. Physics, Chemistry,  Biology, and Engineering are considered as the  high priority S&T research areas in Odisha. Next  priority areas are Agriculture Sciences, Medical  Sciences, and Material Sciences. Comparatively less  publication are found in subjects like Mathematics  and Earth Sciences.

4.3 Status of Odisha’s International  
Collaboration 
There are approximately 12 % of papers having  collaboration with one or more foreign authors,  whereas India’s overall collaboration rate is 15 %6.  Maximum collaborated papers are published with  USA. Table 4 contains the first 20 countries where  maximum authors of Odisha have collaborated.  Most of the such countries (Table 4) in S&T have  collaboration with authors of the State.  
Ten subjects were selected to find the degree  of international collaboration. In Table 5, the  number of internationally collaborated papers and  number of countries are presented. It is found  that the maximum countries have collaborated in  physics discipline. Less international collaboration  is found in the areas of Geology, Agriculture, and  Mathematics. Presently research is getting more and  more interdisciplinary. Due to this interdisciplinary  research and inter-institutional collaborations are  necessary to increase productivity and quality of  research. Higher international collaboration rate is  found for articles of IOP, Bhubaneshwar. It is one  of the reasons for high productivity of IOP.

The number of international collaborated papers  and number of collaborated countries from different  continents with the authors of Odisha is presented  in Table 6. Around 90 % of European countries  have collaboration with the authors of the state  and contributing the highest number of collaborated  papers for Europe. Next is Asia also contributing  second highest number of collaborated papers.  As USA has the highest number of collaborated  papers so the number of papers per countries  for North America is the highest. International  collaboration also increases the visibility of research,  and citation impact. It is found that both the degree  of collaboration and citation impact rate are high  for physics papers. 
4.4 Publications of Universities of Odisha 
In this study we have taken five universities of  Odisha which were started before 1970. They have  a long history of research activity. Utkal University  (UU), Bhubaneswar started in 1943. Orissa University  of Agriculture Technology (OUAT), Bhubaneswar  (1962) is the second oldest agriculture university in  the country. Sambalpur University (SU), Berhampur  University (BU) both were in existance since 1967.  Ravenshaw University (RU), Cuttack started as  college in 1868. Its post graduate department began  in 1922. In 2006, it was declared as a deemed  university. In Table 7, the number of publications  for these five universities are represented year-wise  from 1970-2011. For OUAT, the publications of its  constituent colleges are also included with the total  publications of the university. Figure 2 shows that  for all cases the number of publications increases  for initial years (1971-79). The productivity for  Ravenshaw University (RU) was high for the period  1972-82, also it had attained the highest number  among all the universities; however it declines  then onwards. For other universities the rate of  publication falls for the period 2002-2005. For three  universities (UU, SU, BU) increasing trend started  since 2005 but for the rest two universities (OUAT,  RU) increasing trend started frm 2006. However,  the trend is by and large same.

4.5 Publications of New Institutions 
From study it is found that there are many new  S&T institutes who have started publications. Some  of these institutions are government funded and  others are private institutions. Eleven institutions  have been selected to study the rate of research  output in term of publications. The publications  of those institutions for the year 2007-2011 are  presented in Table 8. It shows the publications of  new institutions are continuously increasing. It is  a good sign that many GOI-funded projects are  sanctioned to these institutions. That may be a one  of the reasons for rapid increase of papers from  2006 for Odisha.  
4.6 Publications of Colleges in Odisha 
In this study it is found that most of the colleges  in Odisha have contributed articles in journals. A few  of them are selected with their publications and the  results are presented in Table 9 (decade-wise). It  is found that out of seven, only one college (Fakir  Mohan Auto. College) has high publication record  for the period 2001-2011. Other colleges have  good initial research output but in the last decade  publication have decreased. 
4.7 Preferred Journals for Publishing 
It is a good indicator that the authors in Odisha  have published their research outputs in high impact  journals like Nature, Nature Materials, New England

Journal of Medicine, Blood, Physical Reviews,  Physical Review Letters, Soil Biology Biochemistry,  Tetrahedron, British Journal of Surgery, Gut, Chest  etc.  total of 2,134 journals are used to publish  
their papers. Some of the high preferred publishing  journals with number of times published in the  selected time period of study with their impact factor  (IF) are presented in Table 10. For IF of journals,  ISI Journal Citation Reports for 2010 is used. In  all disciplines the maximum preferred journals for  publication are Indian journals except for physics  
where more foreign journals are preferred over  Indian journals. It is general that the subjects like  Agriculture is more region specific so an article has  good use if that is published in a highly circulated  journals of the country, but in other way science is  an international activity without internationalisation  it cannot progress6. Thus, the research work must  be visible worldwide otherwise the researchers will  be isolated from mainstream. Also publishing in a  high impact factor journals helps in getting funding  from national and international agencies.

To study the scattering phenomenon of papers  in different journals, a graph (Fig. 3) was drawn  with cumulative number of publications and number  of journals, it is found that the curve mostly fits to  the logarithmic growth of Bradford’s function  
F(x)   =  a + b log  x.  
F(x) =  the cumulative number of papers contained  in the first x most productive journal, a and b are  constants.  
Here, function for trend line is Y  or  
F(x)  = 1542.8ln(x) + (- 353.75),  
Value of ‘a’ is -353.75 and ‘b’ is 1542.8. 
5.  CONCLUSIONS 
It is good indicator that publication output of  Odisha is increasing continuously in the last six years.  Researchers of the state have been collaborating  with the authors of different institutions within  the country and across the globe. But still some  priority areas are neglected, like Clinical Sciences,  Geology, Environmental Sciences, Marine Sciences,  and Computer Sciences. There is rise and fall of  research publications in state universities, which  shows there is no regular continuous research. It  shows that there are some pitfalls which hinder  the research work. Also, in old reputed colleges of  state publications output have decreased. The main  factors contributing to research is highly experienced  researchers and resources. There are shortage of  
experienced faculties in universities and colleges of  the state7. As S&T creates new resources so it should  not be neglected. State government should create  more funds for this sector. New institutes may be  created where the experienced scientific community  working outside of the country can be attracted.
