1. INtrODUctION 
Books  are  always  a  rich  source  of  information  and insight on diversified subjects of life. Information  technology  has  influenced  every  aspect  of  our  life  and  there  is  no  exception  to  books. There  used  to  be  a  time  when  book  buying  was  considered  an  arduous job. Emergence of e-Bookshops on a large  scale  worldwide  has  provided  great  ease  to  the  buyers.  The  buyers  can  search  for  their  required  books  on  the  web  portal  of  the  e-Bookshops  by  sitting  in  their  houses  or  workplaces,  order  online  and  receive  the  books  at  their  doorsteps.  In  any  library,  the  acquisition  process  can  be  simplified  by  shopping  books  online.  e-Bookshops  being  run  on  web  servers  are  open  24x7.  Bibliographic  data  of  books  can  be  easily  checked  and  verified  using  the online catalogues provided on the site. Updating  the online catalogue is much easier and faster than  the printed catalogue. Apart from this, the price and  discounts offered can be known instantly helping in  optimum budget planning and utility. By just having  a computer with internet connection, all information  can  be  obtained  by  the  user  on  his/her  desktop.  With  rapid  developments  in  e-commerce,  ordering  process  is  also  hassle  free  thereby  reducing  the  time  delay  in  the  procurement  of  books. The  trend  of  trading  books  online  is  getting  popularity  with  each passing day and increasing numbers of people  are  inclined  to  indulge  in  online  trading  of  books.  This is because of increased ease and convenience  introduced  through  the  process.  Traditional  ways  of  ordering  books  by  libraries,  institutions,  and  individuals are being expanded to take advantage of  the internet. Mergers and acquisitions are frequent 
among  the  online  European  booksellers,  and  as  in  any  volatile  internet  market,  new  companies  form  and  disappear  rapidly.  The  European  book  market  is  comprised  of  three  sectors:  Consumer  books,  schoolbooks, and academic and professional books.  Consumer  sales  account  for  more  than  two  thirds  of  the  market.  Most  of  these  books  are  sold  by  both  large  chain  or  by  smaller  independent  stores.  A small proportion of these books are sold through  internet  booksellers.  The  majority  of  the  websites  offering price comparison for books are US or UK- based  and  do  not  account  for  the  intricacies  and  variety  in  European  book  pricing.

ADVANtAGES  OF e-BOOKSHOPS 
The  major  advantages  of  e-Bookshops  are: They provide an environment of guaranteed 24x7  access  to  the  people  for  searching,  ordering  and  purchasing  of  the  books. 
They  allow  viewing  and  comparing  a  lot  of  books  at  one  time.  
They  are  repositories  of  a  vast  amount  of  information about books currently in the market  and  all  internet  subscribers  can  use  them  free  of  charges. 
They  are  convenient  for  scholars  and  others  looking for specific books by spending very little  time. People who do not live near a bookshop,  or  cannot  get  to  one,  can  also  save  time  and  avoid  trouble  of  traveling  long  distances. Due to information explosion in each and every  field and discipline of knowledge, a huge volume

of literature is being published in each subject.  
The  publishers’  lists  may  not  reach  the  library  
or  the  user  in  time,  but  these  lists  can  be  
accessed through the e-Bookshops immediately.  
Such lists save the time of librarian in searching  
for  the  latest  literature. 
There  are  a  large  number  of  e-Bookshops  where  customer  can  find  books  by  just  key-ing  in  a  little  information  about  the  required  book  or  document.  The  advantage  of  e-Bookshops  is  that  
4. MEtHODOLOGY 
The present study broadly applies the methodology  of  content  analysis  wherein  primary  data  is  drawn  from filtering of information provided on the relevant  websites. Besides this, published literatures are also  being extensively consulted for critical synthesis of  knowledge. By following the methodology of system  theory,  the  variables  selected  for  examination  and  evaluations include ‘Statement of Collection’, ‘Help  Menu’,  ‘Shopping  Procedure’,  ‘Payment  Modes’,  
bulk  order,  which  makes  it  more  appealing  for  book  collectors  and  customers  to  shop  online. The

‘Special Facility provided for Online Purchase’, ‘User  of  heavy  discounts.  They  also  offer  discounts  for  
Search  Support’,  ‘Details  of  Product’,  ‘Navigation  
Links’,  and  ‘Special  Discounts’.  The  study  has  
adopted  a  50  marks  scoring  system  to  assign  the  
purpose  of  this  research  is  to  chart  out  the  best  
scores  to  each  e-Bookshop.  Based  on  the  marks  
obtained,  the  bookshops  have  been  graded  and  
comparative  practices  of  e-Bookshop  by  following  the  methodology  of  case  comparison. 
3. OBJEctIVES  OF  St UDY 
This study has been undertaken with the following  research  objectives: 
• Observe the category classification of the collections  
provided  by  the  foreign  e-Bookshops • Study  the  help  menu  provided  and  shopping  
procedures  adopted 
• Observe  the  user  search  support  system • Study  the  navigation  facilities  provided  by  the  
foreign  e-Bookshops 
• Study  the  special  facilities  for  online  
purchase 
• Study  the  modes  of  payment  of  bills  accepted  
by  the  foreign  e-Bookshops 
• Study  the  discount  schemes  offered  by  the  
foreign  e-Bookshops 
• Study  the  product  details  provided 
•   r ank  and  grade  foreign  e-Bookshops 
Keeping in view these objectives, the proposed  
ranked.  During  research  process,  it  appeared  that  out of the large number of e-bookshops, these five  e-bookshops are more preferably being used by a large  number of users and are more famous than others. 
In  the  present  study,  the  evaluation  and  comparison  of  e-Bookshops  is  limited  to  five  therefore, standard overview cannot be made. Only  broad  trends  can  be  marked  out,  and  structures,  design,  organisation  of  information,  content,  and  searching  facilities  of  e-Bookshops  are  frequently  updating.  Hence,  it  will  be  difficult  to  reach  on  a  conclusion  about  the  organisation  and  content  of  an  e-Bookshop.

  carried  out  an  in-depth  case  study  on  Amazon  and  highlighted  in  his  paper  how  this  firm  is  exploiting  the  emerging  technology-driven  media  and  the  growth  of  the  internet  to  rewrite  the  rules  of  competition  in  the  book  retailing  industry. Kruse & Holtzman2  described the historical  background  of  the  library  acquisitions  when  the  libraries used to purchase most of their books from  wholesalers catering to the library market. They also  discussed about the new concept of web booksellers  
foreign  e-Bookshops  (Table  1).

The authors opined that purchasing from web vendors  tends to increase library administrative costs because  of  institutional  credit  card  and  auditing  policies,  double  data  entry  on  the  web  vendor’s  interface  and  local  library  system,  and  other  factors.  They  reached  at  the  conclusion  that  depending  on  local  administrative costs, libraries may find web vendors  the  best  choice  for  purchasing  out  of  print,  foreign  and  rush  titles.  Yang  &  Varnadoe3   carried  out  a  case study about the internet application in service  industry–online bookstores (Barnes & Noble.com and  Amazon.com)  and  related  operational  issues  with  the research objective to investigate the trends and  level of prevalence of on-line book selling business  (i.e., e-bookstore) focusing on some emerging issues

6.2   c ollection  Statement 
A collection is the set of items that a bookshop  
USA and Amazom, UK fall under excellent category  possesses. A good e-Bookshop is one, which possesses  while  the  internet  bookshops  from  India  viz.,  D.K.  an  excellent  collection  of  books  and  other  related  
Agencies and Khemraj fall under good and average  category,  respectively.  Chmielarz5   evaluated  and

selected websites in Polish book sector with regard  details about the collection available on the respective  
to  quality  measured  by  their  usefulness  for  an  individual  client.  He  presented  the  characteristics  of the sector and basic methodological assumptions  and  conducted  evaluations  by  means  of  a  simple  scoring  method  with  preferences  and  relational  research.  The  findings  have  been  analysed  and  the  results  of  the  study  were  compared.

websites  of  the  e-Bookshops. 
On the basis of Table 3, it can be observed that  the selected foreign e-bookshops are rich in collection  but The Book Depository and Blackwell do not have  journals  as  part  of  their  collections  on  offer.

6.4 Shopping  Procedure 
Each  e-Bookshop  follows  a  specific  shopping  procedure.  For  the  convenience  of  a  new  customer,  these  websites  are  expected  to  include  links  describing  procedure  of  ordering,  obtaining  membership, checking out, cart facility, help, special  discounts  offered  and  delivery  system.  Detailed  findings of the shopping procedure as available on  the  respective  websites  of  the  e-Bookshops  under  the  present  study  are  presented  in  Table  5. 
Shopping  process  begins  from  becoming  a  member  of  e-Bookshop  to  receiving  of  the  items.  During  the  analysis  of  shopping  procedure,  it  has  been  observed  that  all  the  e-Bookshops  under  the  present  study  provide  the  procedures  of  ordering,  checking  out,  delivery  systems,  etc.  TSO  was  not  found  offering  Special  Discount.

The  Book  Depository was found to be not offering the facility  of having a Permanent Account on its website while  Blackwell  was  found  to  be  not  accepting  Digital  Cash  and  Electronic  Cheque. 
6.6 Special  Facilities  for  Online  Purchase 
Online purchasing not only helps the customers  to  view  all  the  items  available  on  the  e-Bookshops  at  one  place  sitting  at  home  or  at  any  convenient  place  but  also  shows  the  items  that  will  be  added  soon. It also shows the items that are recently being  added  along  with  their  abstracts.  It  further  shows  the  special  discount  that  will  be  provided  by  the  e-Bookshops  on  the  purchase  of  a  particular  item.  The  details  about  these  special  facilities  for  online  purchase  have  been  reported  in  Table  7. 
It can be observed that almost all the selected  e-bookshops  offer  special  facilities  for  online  purchase  except  Blackwell  which  does  not  provide  information  about  ‘Coming  Soon’  titles,  while  TSO  does not provide review Services about the books/ documents and also does not have any mention of  ‘Special  Discount’.

e-Bookshops  are  expected  to  provide  strong  search facilities to help the customers in the retrieval  of the most relevant results in shortest time period.

The  findings of the user search support systems adopted by  the  e-Bookshops  have  been  reported  in  Table  8.

7. FINDINGS AND cONcLUSIONS 
Foreign e-Bookshops in the present study contain  good collection. Amazon, Barnes & Noble and TSO  Online Bookshop were the richest in collection among  the selected cases while The Book Depository and  Blackwell  lack  journals  as  part  of  their  collections.  Help  Menu  of  the  selected  e-Bookshops  are  found  to provide good information to the customers. Only  TSO  Online  Bookshop  does  not  provide  Site  Map  on  its  web  portal.  Almost  all  the  selected  cases  provide  clear  statement  of  shopping  procedure  to  the  customers  except  TSO  Online  Bookshop,  which  does  not  offer  special  discounts.  All  the  five  e-Bookshops  accept  almost  all  the  prominent

modes  of  payment  but  majority  of  them  do  not  accept Demand Drafts except TSO Online Bookshop.  The  Book  Depository  does  not  provide  facility  of  Permanent Account while Blackwell does not accept  Digital Cash and Electronic Cheque. Majority of the  selected cases were found to provide almost all the  special facilities and information for online purchase  to their customers except Blackwell, which does not  provide  information  regarding  Coming  Soon  titles.  TSO  Online  Bookshop  does  not  provide review  Service  and  Special  Discounts.  
The  foreign  e-Bookshops  in  the  present  study  also provide good searching facilities except Barnes  &  Noble,  which  does  not  support  searching  by

Year  of  Publication  and The  Book  Depository  does  not  support  searching  using  Boolean  Operators  in  addition to Year of Publication. The selected cases  are  very  rich  in  providing  details  about  the  various  products  but  Barnes  &  Noble  and  TSO  Bookshop  both do not provide information about the contents  and  edition  of  the  books.  The  web  portals  of  all  the  selected  cases  provide  excellent  navigation  facilities to their customers for ease of access and  navigation across their web pages. On an average,  the  selected  foreign  e-Bookshops  take  around  2-3  days  time  for  delivery  inside  their  country  and  in  case the book or any other product is required to be  imported from outside the country, the delivery time  usually  taken  is  around  5-10  days.  Majority  of  the  e-Bookshops provides one-day express delivery and  offer attractive discounts on their various products.  Among  them,  Amazon  offers  maximum  discounts  followed  by  Barnes  &  Noble,  Blackwell  and  The  Book  Depository. 
The  outcome  of  the  present  study  brings  forth  the strength and weaknesses of e-Bookshops in the  domain of e-Commerce and e-Business world over.
