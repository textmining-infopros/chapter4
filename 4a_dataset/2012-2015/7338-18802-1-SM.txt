With  concerns  about  climate  change  and  its  impact  on  the  monsoon  cycle  over  South Asia  and  its  ramifcations  elsewhere  on  the  globe,  there  has  been  renewed  interest  in  the    science  behind  the  forces  that  drive  the  annual  cycle  and  its  variability  from  year  to  year  and  within  the  season. This  is  refected in the growing research output in this area, particularly from India and China. In this paper, a  comprehensive  and  in-depth  bibliometric  analyses  that  breaks  down  scholarly  performance  into  three  components - quantity, quality and consistency have been conducted. The citation data is retrieved from  the Web of Science. The most productive organisations, countries, authors and also the most infuential  journals in which this newly emerging area is published using these criteria, with particular emphasis on  
the Indian contribution have been identifed.

1.  INtRODUctION 
The  monsoon  system  determines  the  weather  and  climate  over    most  parts  of  Asia,  mainly  the  Indian sub-continent, and over South-east Asia and  large parts of China. Directly, it influences the lives  of  nearly  one-third  of  the  world  population  and  indirectly  the    lives    of    nearly    three-quarters    of   the    world    population.  
At  one  time,  India  accounted  for  nearly  half  of  the  academic  research  in  this  area.  This  is  not  surprising, as ever since the name originated from the  Arabic (‘mausam’ for seasons  became ‘monsoon’),  the monsoon, characterised by seasonally reversing  winds  and  rains    was  associated  mainly  with  the  Indian  and  South Asian  regions.  It  is  only  recently  with  the  emergence  of  global  satellite  data  and  images  and  computational  models  that  integrate  the  global  earth  and  atmospheric  systems  that  the  monsoon  began  to  be  seen  as  a  very  complex  global  phenomenon. 
As predictable as the annual cycle of the monsoon  is  in  bringing  wet  summers  and  dry  winters  to  the  South  Asian  region,  equally  unpredictable  is  its  variability  from  year  to  year  and  even  within  a  season. A small negative departure from the expected  long  term  average  rainfall  can  mean  a  significant  drop  in  food  production  and  this  understandably  has  a  considerable  impact  on  the  economies  of  this region. Because of global warming and climate  change, changes in the monsoon rainfall may have  a  large  impact  on  agricultural  productivity  in  the

coming years1. This is one reason why there is now  increased  attention  given  to  monsoon  forecasting.  This  is  clear  from  the  bibliometric  evidence  from  1987  to  2012,  that  the  number  of  records  in  the  Web  of  Science   database  has  increased  from  48  to  1833. 
The Web of Science  database allows us to refine  the results in terms of publication years, countries,  organisations,  authors  and  journals  (source  titles),  etc.  The  focus  in  this  paper  will  be  mainly  on  the  research  activity  in  India  in  this  area.  We  examine  this area of research in terms of the top countries,  top  organisations,  top  authors  and  finally  the  most  influential  journals  in  which  these  papers  have  appeared.  The  3-D  evaluation  recently  proposed  by  Prathap2,3   is  used.  A  simple  heuristic  model 
4,5 using 2-D quantity (productivity in terms of number  of papers published) and quality (specific impact as  defined  by  citations  per  paper)  are  complemented  with  a  third  dimension,  called  consistency η.  This  enables  a  better  3-D  evaluation  of  the  information  production process. If  the number of papers is P, the  quality (or impact si), is measured by the ratio C/P,  where, C   is  the  total  number  of  citations  received  by P   papers.  The  third  dimension,    consistency  η  is  a  measure  of    the  variability  in  the  quality  of  the  individual  papers  in  the  publication  set,  or  in  other  words,  the  shape  of  the  distribution  curve. 
Using all three components together, a z-index  can  be  computed  from  an  energy-like  term:  
Z   =  ηX  =  η2E     as  z  =  Z 
1/3,

DJLIT,  VOL.  34,  NO.  3, MAy  2014 
which has the same dimensions as the number  of  publications,  and  therefore  also  the  h-index.  Where  X   is    Exergy  and    E    is    Energy 
4,5,  it  is  possible  to  imagine  a  composite  indicator  named  Zynergy  for  Z   =  ηX   =  η2E.  This  index  combines  quantity,  quality,  and  consistency  (or  efficiency)  to  give  a  3-D  bibliometric  evaluation.  Thus,  the    h-   and   z-  are  secondary  single  number  bibliometric  indicators  of  performance. 
The  precise  computation  of  η   requires  the  knowledge  of  the  complete  citation  sequence  (i.e.,  
that    the  exergy  indicator  X   =  i2P,  is  an  energy  like  quantity  which  can  be  thought  of  as  a  second  order indicator of performance. This paradigm then  leads  to  a  trinity  of  energy  like  terms4,5: 
X   =  i2P 
E  = ∑ c 
2 
S   =  ∑( ckk   –  i)

 =   E   –  X 
where

the distribution curve) for each individual scientist (or  Ever  since  the  h-index  was  proposed,  it  is  a  aggregation  like  institute,  journal  or  country).  This common practice to rearrange the citation sequences   
is  obtained  directly  from  the  Web  of  Science   for  each country, organisation, author and journal taken  up  in  the  present  analysis  and  the  methodology  to  obtain  this  is  as  follows: 
2.    s EcOND-ORDER  INDIcAtORs   FROM  
tHE  PRIMARY  QUALItY,  QUANtItY  AND  
cONsIstENcY  INDIcAtORs 
The  journal  impact  factor  is  now  increasingly  accepted  as  a  proxy  or  indirect  measure  of  the  quality  or  scholarly  influence  of  a  journal6.  In  the  same  way,  the  scientific  output  of  an  individual  or  an  entity  can  be  measured  using  the  following  parameter  space: 
2.1 Quantity 
No.  of  papers/articles  ‘P’   published  during  a  prescribed window which will be called the publication  window  (in  this  case,  the  window  is  from  1987  to  the  date  of  access  of  Web  of  Science  database). 2.2  Quality 
The  impact   ‘i’   computed  as  C/P,  where  C   is  
window of all the articles  P. Note that the definition  
in    a  monotonically  decreasing  order.  Very  high  
skews are noticed because the highly cited articles  are  found  in  a  small  core,  implying  a  possible  
huge  variation  in  the  quality  of  each  paper  in  the  
publication  set.  Thus,  two  different  sets  can  have  the  same  C,  and  one  could  have  achieved  this  
with  far  fewer  papers,  with  a  higher  quality  of  overall  performance,  or  with  the  same  number  of  papers  (i.e.,  same  quality)  but  a  higher  degree  of  
consistency  or  evenness.  Thus,  C   by  itself,  which  
is  a  first-order  indicator  may  not  be  the  last  word  
on  the  measurement  of  performance.  The  product  
X = iC = i2P   is a robust second-order performance  
indicator4,5  is arguably a better proxy for performance.  
Apart from X, an additional indicator E  also appears  
as  a  second-order  indicator. The  coexistence  of X 
and E   allows  us  to  introduce  a  third  attribute  that  
is  neither  quantity  nor  quality.  In  a  bibliometric  
context,  the  appellation  ‘consistency’  may  be  more  
meaningful. The simple ratio of X   to  E  can be viewed  
as  the  third  component  of  performance,  namely,  
the consistency term η  =  X/E.  Perfect  consistency  
X=E)  is  a  case  of  absolutely  
year  citation  window6-9.  In  the  present  case,  these  are  taken  as  identical,  i.e.,  from  1987  till  date  of  access. 
Once the  quantity   P   and  quality   i   parameters  
the number of citations during a prescribed citation  
(η  =1,  i.e.,  when  
uniform  performance;  that  is,  all  papers  in  the  set  of i needs  two distinct windows to be identified, the  
have  the  same  number  of  citations,  ck   =  c.  The  publication  window  and  the  citations  window.  The  
greater the skew, the larger is the concentration of  famous  JIF  is  based  on  the  use  of  a  publication  
the best work in a very few papers of extraordinary  window of two years immediately preceding a single  
impact.  The  inverse  of  consistency  thus  becomes  
a  measure  of  concentration. 
Thus, for a complete 3-D evaluation of publication  activity, one needs  P, i,  and  η. These are the three primary  components of a quantity–quality–consistency landscape. 
are defined, it is possible to postulate the following  3. 
sequence  of  indicators  of  performance5: 
Zeroth  order  indicator:   P    =    i0P 
First  order  indicator:       C    =    i1P 
Second  order  indicator: X  =   i2P   =  i1C  =  i. 
C     is  derived  from  the  citation    sequence,   ck    of  the  citations  of  each  paper  in  a  publication

About  the Author 
Dr Gangan Prathap   is  working  as  an  Outstanding  Scientist, National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science  and Technology  (NIIST-CSIR), Thiruvananthapuram.  he  was trained as an Aerospace Engineer and specialised  in mathematical modeling and computer simulation  of  complex  problems  in  aerospace  engineering.  For  more  than  thirty  years,  he  has  also  pursued  a  parallel interest in research evaluation, bibliometrics,  and  scientometrics  and  the  application  of  physical  and mathematical insights for research assessment.  In recent years, he has proposed a thermodynamic  basis for bibliometric sequences which can lead to  better  indicators  for  research  evaluation  like  the  p-index and the EEE-sequences. he has served at  many  premier  institutions  in  India  like  the  National  Aerospace Laboratory (NAL), Bangalore, Centre for  Mathematical  Medelling  and  Computer  Simulation  (C-MMACS)  (now  CSIR  4PI),  Bangalore,  Cochin
