 Electronic information sources are computer-based information sources. There are several forms  and types of electronic resources which are available on the internet. Some of the popular ones that are  gaining ground are the electronic journals, standards, technical specifcations, reports, patents, full-text  articles, trade reports, and hosts of other document sources. This paper presents the fndings of a survey  about the awareness and use of electronic resources by medical students available in the medical institute  libraries. The subjects chosen for this study were faculty members and medical students of Sher-E-Kashmir  Institute  of  Medical  Science  (SKIMS),  Jammu  and  Kashmir,  India.  For  evaluating  study  questions  and  data collection, the questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 300 faculty members, MD/MS  (i.e., PG) and MBB fnal year (i.e., UG) students. The results of this survey are presented and discussed  
in this paper.

1. INtrODUctION 
The  advent  of  information  technology  has  resulted  in  reducing  the  size  of  libraries.  In  fact,  these  small  modern  libraries  have  rich  potential  of  information.  It  has  been  possible  due  to  the  digitisation of information. The digital and electronic  information  is  based  on  digitised  data/information,  which has gradually replaced paper-based records.  As  the  visual  information  system  in  comparison  to  text-based  information  system  is  getting  more  and  more  popular  these  days,  the  traditional  libraries  are  becoming  hybrid  libraries  as  they  are  in  the  process of doing digitisation of their documents and  moving towards to become digital libraries. Internet  has  become  an  unavoidable  requirement  for  every  institution  of  higher  learning.  The  medical  and  technical education is important for the development  of  any  country.  The  medical  institutes  are  very  much needed to provide disease free society in the  country.  Use  of  the  internet  is  a  part  of  university  students’  daily  routine,  because  they  have  grown  up  with  computers.  It  is  integrated  into  their  daily  communication habits and has become a technology  as ordinary as the telephone or television. Medical  college students use the internet nearly as much for  social communication as they do for their education.  But  just  as  they  use  the  internet  to  supplement  the  formal  parts  of  their  education,  they  go  online  to  enhance  their  social  lives.  The  internet  facility

in  India  has  grown  tremendously  grown  over  the  years.  The  use  of  internet  is  rapidly  increasing  owing  to  its  efficiency  and  capability  in  providing  right information to the right person at the right time.  Internet  has  become  an  unavoidable  necessasity  for every institution of higher learning. The medical  institutes  are  very  much  needed  for  the  scientific  advancement  of  the  country. An  attempt  has  been  made  to  determine  the  present  status  and  use  of  electronic resources (e- resources) at Sher-E-Kashmir  Institute  of  Medical  Science  (SKIMS)  by  faculty  members,  PG  (MD/MS)  and  UG  (MBBS)  final  year  students.  Medical  faculty,  MD/MS  (PG)  students  and  MBBS  (UG)  students  more  accomplished  and  innovative in the work force, information plays vital  role, for accessing information and keeping abreast  with the new developments, and internet is becoming  an  essential  human  need  with  all  its  facets.

it  effectively  contributes  to  the  hospitals’  primary  mission of providing patients with the best possible  care and by supporting the  delivery of patient care  by  providing  physicians,  health  care  professionals,  nurses,  technologists,  etc.,  with  library  services  to  meet their informational, educational and research- related needs. The SKIMS is a big institute with large  faculty,  executive  officers,  PG’s  research  scholars,  post doctoral scholars and other supporting staff in  hundreds.  To  serve  the  objectives  of  patient  care,  education  and  research,  the  skims  is  developing  its  library  as  an  effective  information  center.

4. LItErAtUrE rEVIEW  
There are numbers of studies on use of e-resources  by students and faculty members. Achonna1   in  his  research found, use of e-journal resources were low.  Lack  of  skills,  inadequate  provision  of  computers  and power outrage etc. were the problems faced in  use  of  e-resources.  Study  concluded  the  need  for  the training skills, provision of adequate computers,  need  to  popularise  the  IT  and  its  usage  and  to  motivate  the  students  to  use  e-journal  resources.   Joteen  Singh2,  et  al.  executed  a  study  on  use  of  internet-based  e-resources  at  Manipur  University  to  examine  the  use  of  e-information  focusing  on  the  internet  services  by  post  graduate  students,  
patient care and found that users prefer web-based  resources over traditional library and users perceive  that web contains exhaustive information and is easy  to  use.  Baskaran4   revealed  that  maximum  use  of  library is by faculty of science particularly scientific  e-journals  for  repairing  seminars,  conferences  and  other  assignments.  Bashorun5,   et  al.,   found  that  the  frequency  of  use  of  e-resources  by  teaching  staff  was  low,  as  most  of  the  faculty  time  is  spent  on  teaching.  The  study  also  pointed  out  some  of  the  problems  like  lack  of  awareness  to  users  about  electronic  resources  provided  by  the  library,  lack  of  electricity  supply  to  use  computer,  slow  speed of network, and inadequate searching skills.  Kumar  &  Kumar6   found,  in  his  study  of  medical  and  management  colleges  in  Bangalore  that  the  users  are  well  aware  of  e-resources  and  prefer  to  use  internet. 
5. MEtHODOLOgY  
The  questionnaire  tool  was  used  for  collecting  the  data  from  the  faculty  members  and  students  of  SKIMS.  A  total  number  of  300  questionnaires  were  distributed  among  the  faculty  members  and  students. This constitutes 80% (240/300) of the total  response. The present study, in its survey of medical  professionals about the use of e-resources, has the  sample  of  300  (120  UG  students,  70  PG  students  and  110  faculty  members)  respondents,  selected  from  SKIMS  library.  The  investigator  could  collect  questionnaires  from  only  240  out  of  300  medical  faculty  members  and  students  among.

Table 9 presents data on the respondents’ views  on  library  services.  It  could  be  noted  that  more  than  one  third  of  the  general  surgery  respondents  (42.11 %) and general medicine respondents (37.5 %)  observe  that  library  services  are  excellent. around  one fourth of the general medicine and anesthesiology  respondents view mainly that they have no opinion  about  library  services.  A  considerable  number  of  anesthesiology  respondents  (31.44  %)  perceive  about  the  poor  performance  of  library  service.  Around  one  third  of  the  gastroenterology  faculty  members  and  students  have  very  poor  opinion  about  library  services.  
7.   rESUL tS AND   D ISScUSSIONS 
The survey launched in April 2012 at the SKIMS  Library revealed that 2-3 hours of access to internet  is  quite  common  among  the  gastroenterology  and  general medicine faculties and students. Neurology  and general surgery faculty members and students  mainly make library visit daily and general medicine  faculty and student respondents make high level of  library visit at once in a week.

BhaT  & M UDhol: USe of e-ReSoURceS By facUlTy MeMBeRS  an D  S TUDenTS  of SKIMS 
surgery  faculty  and  student  respondents  (42.11%)  and  neurology  faculty  and  student  respondents  (35.72 %) search library documents with the help of  library catalogue. Anesthesiology faculty and student  respondents occupy the first position with respect to  their overall satisfaction on all search engines, the  general  medicine  faculty  and  student  respondents  top the position with respect to their overall purpose  of using e-resources as their secured mean score is  3.85 on a 5 point rating scale. Neurology respondents  take  the  first  position  with  respect  to  their  overall  barriers  in  accessing  e-resources,  more  than  one  third of the general surgery respondents (42.11 %)  and general medicine respondents (37.5 %) observe  that library services are excellent.  The advantages  of  e-resources  have  drawn  attention  of  the  library  users to a great extent. accordingly, these resources  have  occupied  a  significant  place  in  the  collection  and  budget  of  almost  all  libraries. 
Medical Faculty members and students’ attitudes  seem  to  be  very  positive  towards  e-resources  for  their study and research and the role of libraries as  gateway  to  provide  assistance  in  accessing  these  resources.  Faculty  members  and  students  heavily  depend on e-resources for their required information  and  to  keep  themselves  up-to-date  in  their  subject  area. Though some expects that the role of libraries  as  a  gateway  to  the  e-resources  will  have  less  importance in future as faculty members and medical  students access more and more e-resources in their  respective departments or personal desktop/laptops,  it  seems  to  be  more  hypothetical.  Rather  the  role  of  libraries  in  the  age  of  e-resources  will  increase  tremendously,  particularly  in  providing  training  and  guidance to use authentic and relevant information.  The  libraries  should  develop  necessary  tools  to  provide  such  services  to  their  users  satisfactorily.  The  speed  of  internet  needs  to  be  increased  for  quick  access  to  the  available  e-resources.  The  SKIMS  Central  Library  needs  to  arrange  various  orientation  and  training  programmes  for  faculty  members  and  students  for  the  optimum  use  of  available  e-resources.  In  this  context,  the  SKIMS  Library  may  arrange  orientation  programmes  and  subscribe  more  databases  for  its  users. 
8. SUggEStIONS 
Based on the various observations of the study  the  following  suggestions  are  made:  
• More computer terminals should be installed in  
the  library  for  easy  access  to  faculty  members  
and  students.  
• Problems of slow access speed can be overcome  
by  increasing  the  bandwidth. 
• Increasing resources should be allocated for enriching  
digital  resources  for  the  benefit  of  users.  •   a wareness should be generated on the e-resources  
to  obtain  current  information.  
• Qualified  medical  staff  should  be  appointed  
to  provide  the  expert  guidance  to  users  about  
e-resources. 
Some orientation training programmes should be  organised by the SKIMS Library at regular intervals  so  that  the  maximum  users  can  improve  their  excellence  or  proficiency  in  the  use  of  computers  and  e-resources. 
9.   c ONcLUSIONS  
The development of medical e-resources grossly  depends  on  the  application  of  ICT  technologies.  Librarians have a better role to play in the process.  They  have  to  coordinate  the  efforts  of  all  sections  of  medical  or  health  system.  Librarians  are  better  professionals to coordinate different sections of the  communication  system,  as  they  are  familiar  with  the  information  work  as  information  workers.  For  this,  the  governments  and  the  management  of  the  concerned  medical  institutions  should  support  and  encourage  the  libraries  and  librarians  by  framing  necessary  policies,  developing  standards  and  procedures and encouraging specialisation, with an  emphasis  on  E-resource  organisation  and  control,  so  that  the  medical  librarians  will  be  enabled  to  render more productive and efficient services.  The  library environment has currently undergone drastic  change  in  terms  of  collections  and  services.  The  proliferation  of  e-resources  has  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  way  the  academic  community  uses,  stores  and  preserves  information.  Technology  is  in  a  position  now  to  offer  great  potential  for  teaching  and learning medicine. The challenge is to combine  the  expertise  of  technologists  with  the  expertise  of  medical educators, clinicians and basic scientists in  efforts to design and develop innovative approaches  towards  medical  education  that  utilise  IT  to  its  full  potential  for  maximum  educational  value.
