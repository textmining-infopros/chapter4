1.    INTRODUCTION 
Social  media  has  the  possibility  to  help  much  closer relationships between library and information  centres  and  their  customers  wherever  users  are  based,  and  how  they  choose  to  learn  about  and  access library services and resources. In the present  time, libraries and information institutions are facing  unprecedented  change  and  challenge. This  is  very  difficult for library professionals to manage and share  their  resources  with  others  manually.  For  solving  these  problems,  many  technological  development  has  been  discovered  and  creating  new  forms  of  information,  new  sources  of  information  and  new  ways  of  providing  information  bypassing  traditional  institutional like libraries. Now, the actual challenge  for  information  professionals  is  not  to  handle  the  collection,  staff  and  technology,  but  to  turn  these  resources  into  services.  The  concept  of  services  has also changed, from basic to value- added, from  personnel-assisted  to  self-service,  from  in-house  to  outreach,  from  free  to  priced,  from  reactive  to  pro-active,  and  from  mass  customisation  of  individualised service1. Libraries have always connected  people  with  information,  Social  media  is  beginning  
to play an important role in marketing of information  to  library  users  and  in  branding  the  library  as  a  community hub2   where  marketing  is  a  key  function  of  social  media3. 
In  the  recent  time,  Web  2.0  applications  in  libraries have acquired growing reputation worldwide,  it appears that the library must think about marketing  its  services  more  regularly  through  the  internet,  taking  advantage  of  Web  2.0  applications  to  get  better access to its users and to promote information  services.  Social  media  is  a  powerful  new  form  of  communication4. These applications have been widely  used  for  information  dissemination  and  gathering,  collaborative learning and online social and professional  connections4.  Use  of  social  media  is  increasing  rapidly.  Online  social  networking  sites  (SNSs)  hold  great opportunities and challenges for transforming  education  in  countries  like  Bangladesh6.

LinkedIn, Blog, and Twitter are being used to erect  relationships, connection and sharing knowledge with  user  groups,  to  enhance  libraries  and  to  provide  information  services.  Social  networking  sites  were  being  used  by  a  number  of  academic  libraries  and  were  perceived  to  be  helpful  in  promoting  library  services  and  interacting  with  students.  However,  the  implementation  of  these  sites  by  library  staff  was  found  to  be  challenged  by  limited  time  and  perceived  inadequacy  of  the  staff  to  keep  pace  with  the  development  of  technology.8 
With the manifestation of new technologies and  increasing competition in the digital age, marketing  within  Web  2.0  is  a  crucial  factor  for  survival  and  library  professionals  are  aware  about  the  concept  of marketing with new technologies and tools. Most  public libraries (20) are using Facebook as a platform  for marketing themselves and their services and to  uplift  their  collections.  The  exploration  and  use  of  social networking sites applications help to enhance  library  services  and  also  support  library  marketing  and the teaching of Social media literacy, which will  help library and information professionals by giving  them  knowledge  about  these  applications  and  how  they  can  use  them  in  library  and  their  services.4 
In  a  survey  of  ARL  libraries,  Mahmood  &  Richardson9   stated  that  76  libraries  were  using  some  form  of  Web  2.0  technologies,  i.e.,  RSS,  blogs,  social  networking  sites,  wikis  and  instant  messaging were found the most used technologies  as these were used in more than 80 % of academic  libraries. Kumar10  observed that majority of  Sikkim  University students expressed the use of the internet  for  SNSs  and  its  resources  and  were  enthusiastic  in  improving  their  skills  in  the  use  of  SNSs.  
Social  network  advertising  has  potential  to  be  a  cost-effective  means  of  marketing  academic  libraries  and  library  should  have  a  Facebook  page  with  a  large  number  of  fans  that  is  beneficial  to  an  academic  library’s  marketing  effort11.  But  the  LIS  professionals  in  Nigeria  have  not  completely  comprised  these  social  networking  sites  in  library  and information services.12  Khan & Bhatti13   reported  that  the  respondent’s  behavior  towards  the  use  of  social  media  for  marketing  of  library  resources,  services  was  positive  and  suggested  that  libraries  should be connected with the internet services and  develop  their  web  page  and  social  media  page.  
A SNs linked to a university library’s web page  is  to  enable  users’  have  a  live  conversation  with  a  library personnel on issues relating to the use of the  library  and  also  allow  the  libraries  to  market  their  programs  and  operations14.  Libraries  can  publish  in their Facebook  pages, such as new additions to  their  collections,  library  news  and  events,  links  to  articles,  videos,  user  information,  the  soliciting  of  
300 
feedback  and  responses  to  people15.  But  libraries  are  lacking  in  their  promotional  activities.  Library  websites  are  not  totally  used  by  LIS  professionals  as  a  marketing  toolkit  and  an  enabler  to  spread  out  to  the  community  for  advertising  of  information  services and collections. Social media in marketing  of  library  and  information  services  will  help  to  encourage  exchanges  across  worldwide16. 
3.    OBJECTIVES

social  media  also  helpful  for  knowledge  sharing.  
Most of the libraries use social media for marketing  library product and services, for sharing library news  and events, video conferencing, advertisement and  research work. It was also shown that, respondents  were  faced  problem  while  using  social  media  for  electrical failure, for security and privacy, for lacking  of  advanced  IT  skills  personnel  and  for  the  slow  speed  of  internet.  Moreover,  it  was  also  observed  that,  respondents  were  not  agreed  that  they  faced  problems such as, website is difficult to understand  and  use.  Respondent’s  behaviour  towards  the  use  of  social  media  for  marketing  library  services  and  resources was positive. Though a number of libraries  in Bangladesh are not using social media tools, but  they  indicated  positive  impressions  towards  social  media  and  plan  to  adopt  them.  Libraries  should  have  solved  their  problem  and  library  staff  should  be trained and educated regarding social media use  for  marketing  library  resources  and  services  in  the  developing  countries  like  Bangladesh.
