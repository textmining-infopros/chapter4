ABSTRACT 
This study analyses the research output of Bangladesh in S&T during 2001-10 on several parameters  including its growth and country publications share in the world’s research output, country publications  share in various subjects in the national and global context, pattern of research communication in core  domestic and international journals, geographical distribution of publications, share of international  collaborative publications at the national-level as well as across subjects and characteristics of high  productivity institutions, authors, and cited papers. The Scopus Citation Database  has been used to  retrieve the publication data for 10 years. It concludes that Bangladesh needs to increase its output and  bring about improvement in the quality of its research efforts further.  
1. INTRODUCTION 
The economy of Bangladesh is a rapidly developing  market-based economy. Its per capita income in  2010 was est. US $1,700 (adjusted by purchasing  power parity). According to the International Monetary  Fund, Bangladesh ranked as the 43rd largest economy  in the world in 2010 in purchasing power parity  terms and 57th  largest in nominal terms, among the  Next Eleven or N-11 of Goldman Sachs and D-8  economies, with a gross domestic product of US$  269.3 billion in purchasing power parity terms and  US$ 104.9 billion in nominal terms1.  
The adult literacy rate in the country was 56  % in 2009. The public expenditure on education  as a percentage of GDP was 2.4 % and public  expenditure in education as percentage of government  expenditure was 14 % in 20082. The net percentage  of enrollment at primary and secondary level was 86  % (in 2009) and 41 % (in 2007). The percentage of  gross enrollment at tertiary level was 8 % in 20083.  Its HDI index was 0.469 in 2010, ranking at 132th  level. The HDI of the country was 0.469 in 2010,  ranked at 132th  position in the world.  
The history of modern higher education may  be traced back to the establishment of Dhaka  University in 1921. When Bangladesh emerged as  a independent nation in 1971, the country had four  general universities and two specialised universities.  By 2006, Bangladesh had 26 public universities  where 1241352 students study at undergraduate and  postgraduate level. These include those studying at  1175 affiliated colleges. There were 51 professional

colleges (Medical, Dental, Polytechnic, Law, etc.)  where 82,000 students study. With the passage of  ‘Private University Act of Bangladesh’ in parliament  in 1992, it had 56 such private universities by 2008,  where 124267 students persued their studies4.  
The overall science and technology (S&T) activity  of the country is organised under two sectors.  The first is the sector represented by institutions  that are directly funded by the government and  specifically created for R&D activities. The other  sector covers technical universities in agriculture,  engineering and other general universities. The  R&D institutions carry out scientific research, that  directly relate to nation's socio-economic goals. In  the universities, both basic and applied research  is carried out in addition to the teaching of S&T  that aim at creating skilled personnel in different  scientific professions5.  
The National Council for Science and Technology  (NCST), created in 1983, is the main apex body for  S&T at the highest level for policy-making on S&T in  the country. It worked for three years to draft a policy,  which was formally approved by the government in  1986. There is an Executive Committee of the NCST  (ECNCST) headed by the Minister, Science and  Information & Communication Technology. Although  the ECNCST has been meeting in recent years,  these bodies rarely met in the past. The Ministry of  Science and Information & Communication Technology  (MOSICT) acts as the secretariat for the NCST and  is responsible for all matters connected with the  growth and promotion of S&T in the country. The

primary responsibility of this Ministry includes, among  others, assistance to the NCST in policy planning  and decision-making and effective management of  R&D activities carried out by various research and  development institutions under it5. Bangladesh has  74 organisations engaged in R&D till 2005. This list,  however, includes universities, some government-run  routine testing laboratories, medical-research-cum-hospital  centres and scientific support service institutions.  Some of the major organisations involved in R&D  include Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute,  Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, Soil Resources  Development Institute, Bangladesh Tea Research  Institute, Bangladesh Space Research and  Remote  Sensing Organisation, Bangladesh Forest Research  Institute, Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute,  Institute of Post Graduate Medicine and Research,  International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research,  Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Bangladesh  Council of Scientific and  Industrial Research,  Bangladesh National Scientific and Documentation  Centre, Institute of Nuclear Medicine, and River  Research Institute5. Only few scientometric studies  have been carried output on Pakistan. Among these  studies, Mehbuba and Rousseau6  has compared  Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka research  output with India using three indicators, such as  percentage of uncited articles, number of citations  per document and h-indice. Mehbuba7, et al. made  a scientometric comparison between two health  and population research organisations namely,  the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease  Research (ICDDR), Dhaka, Bangladesh and the  National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases  (NICED), Kolkata, India during 1979-2008 in terms  of various indicators. Gupta8  ,  et al.  analysed India’s  collaboration with South Asian countries during  1992-99 using SCI database. Miah9  ,  et al . analysed  articles published in three journals from Chittagong  University to analyse the trends and measure the  quality and authorship pattern in 194 articles on  forestry research in Bangladesh. Ahmad & Rahman10 examine the validity of Lotka’s law to authorship  distribution in the field of nutrition research during  1972-2006. Islam & Alam11  explored 44 private  university websites using Alta Vista search engine  and identifies the number of web pages and link  pages and calculates the overall web impact factor  (WIF) and absolute WIF. 
2. OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of the present study are to  analyse the performance of Bangladesh’s S&T, as  reflected in their publications output during 2001- 10. In particular, it analyses:  
(i)  Publication growth rate and publication share (ii)  Most productive, medium productive, low productive  
and least productive areas of research 
(iii) Share of international collaborative papers and  
identification of major collaborative partners (iv) Publication productive of geographical regions (v)  Characteristics of its high productive institutions,  
authors and high cited papers and 
(vi) Identification of leading medias of  
communication. 
3.  METHODOLOGY AND DATA SOURCE   
This study is based on the Bangladesh publication  data in S&T retrieved from the Scopus Citation  database12  for the 10 years (2001-10). The  Scopus  database is an international multi-disciplinary database  indexing over 18000 titles from more than 5000  publishers, including 16500 peers reviewed journals,  600 trade publications, 350 book series, and 3.6  million international conference/seminar papers.  Scopus  has a worldwide coverage, of which more  than half of the Scopus  contents originate from  Europe, Latin America and the Asia & the Pacific  Region. For citations data, three years, two year  and one year citations window has been used for  computing average citations per paper during 2001-08,  2009 and 2010. For searching and calculating the  total international collaborative papers, a separate  search strategy, which combines Bangladesh’s  collaboration with 140 major countries, was prepared  and this string was combined with the main string  to generate India’s total international collaborative  output. For analysing institutional, individual and  journals output, the separate search strategies for  generating institutional, author and journal outputs  were developed, which later combined with the  main string to generate the desired output. The  study has used a number of absolute publications,  citation and collaborative measures for developing  S&T indicators as needed for depicting Bangladesh’s  status in S&T from 2001 to 2010.   
4.  ANALYSIS 
4.1 S&T Publications Output  
Bangladesh has produced 11688 papers during  the last ten years (2001-10), which are increasing  at an annual average growth rate of 16.64 %.

combined collaborating papers share was highest  (72.67%) with G-8 countries, followed by 18 developing  countries (24.17 %), 13 European countries (14.20  %), 4 South Asian countries (10.99 %) and 2 Pacific  countries (7.82 %) during 2001-10.  
In terms of geographical distribution of papers,  Dhaka and Rajshahi are the two most productive  geographical areas in Bangladesh contributing each  between 10.34 per cent to 63.92 per cent share  and Mymemsing, Chittagong, Khulna, Gazipur, and  Sylhet are the five medium productive geographical  areas contributing each publication share between  3.63 per cent and 7.67 per cent to the total research  output of Bangladesh in S&T during 2001-10. 
The top 20 universities, 16 research institutes  and 9 medical colleges & hospitals (45 organisations)  in Bangladesh together contributed 60.15 per cent,  20.97 per cent and 9.76 per cent share respectively  to the total research output of Bangladesh in S&T  during 2001-10.   
These top 15 authors together contributed 1113  papers with an average productivity of 74.2 papers  per author. These authors together account for 9.52  per cent share in the cumulative publications output  of Bangladesh and recording an average citation  impact per paper of 4.17 and an average h-index  of 11.07 during 2001-10. 
The top 12 domestic journals and 20 most  productive foreign journals publishing Bangladesh’s  research papers accounted each for 11.94 per  cent and 7.78 per cent share respectively in the  cumulative publications output of Bangladesh during  2001-10. 
Bangladesh has published 39 high-cited papers  in science and technology in last 10 years (2001- 10) and these have received between 100 and 415  citations per paper. Of these 39 high-cited papers,  37 were international collaborative (28 bilateral and  9 multilateral) and 2 zero collaborative. Bangladesh  participation in these 37 papers was confined to 12  institutions and 36 journals. To increase its research  output, it has to increase its investment in R&D  and deployment of manpower, which is already  very low. In addition, research climate has to be  improved, besides expanding and modernising its  infrastructure for R&D.
