AbSTRACT 
A survey of CSIR libraries attached to the 38 laboratories and 3 CSIR units has been made with the  main objective of reviewing the current status of the same. For this purpose, the data on infrastructure,  resources, and the services provided by the libraries were collected using questionnaire in e-form. It is  observed that the libraries are at varying levels and status in terms of infrastructural facilities vis-a-vis status  of library staff. Keeping in view the manual guidelines issued by the CSIR during 2008, which renamed  libraries as Knowledge Resource Centres, a few emerging issues like website and content development,  knowledge management initiatives, institutional repositories have been discussed. A description of some  possible future trends, e.g., implementation of knowledge management concepts, use of mobile devices,  and changing user behaviours and expectations have also been touched upon. An overview of status,  issues and possible trends for CSIR libraries ultimately points out the major responsibility of the librarians  which  covers  the  challenge  of  how  to  survive  and  sustain  their  position  as  one  of  the  important  and  crucial stakeholders in the process of S&T information dissemination. It is concluded that the librarians  have come out with more and more knowledge products in this competitive information society by making  continuous  efforts  to  develop  their  skills. This  may  include  implementing  the  various  techniques,  and  methods related to KM aspects including evaluation of websites for streamlining information organisation  and  content  development.  By  adopting  this  strategy  only  libraries  would  be  recognised  as  knowledge  
resource centres in true sense.

1.  InTROduCTIOn 
Council  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  (CSIR)  is  premier  national  R&D  institution  as  a  world’s largest publically-funded organisation under  the Ministry of Science & Technology, Govt. of India.  There  are  38  national  laboratories,  39  outreach  centres, 3 innovation complexes and 5 units under  its network. CSIR’s R&D expertise and experience is  represented by more than 4600 scientists supported  by about 8000 S&T staff. It covers a wide spectrum of  ranging from radio and space physics to environment  engineering  and  information  technology.  CSIR  is  basically  a  learning  organisation  which  puts  much  emphasis  and  focus  on  its  R&D  in  the  broad  area  of S&T. Traditionally speaking, libraries have always  been a store house of information representing and  providing  valuable  guidance  to  convert  the  same  in  to  useful  knowledge  for  the  benefit  of  mankind.  With the evolution of computer and communication  technologies,  libraries  are  getting  transformed  in  to  knowledge  centres  going  beyond  the  traditional  
printed  matter  in  the  form  of  books,  journals,  etc.  Libraries  can  support  networking  of  knowledge  and  people  to  the  maximum  extent  if  the  desired  content and the requirements of users are available  with  them  in  machine  readable  form.  This  ensures  best  use  of  resources  of  knowledge  available  with  CSIR.  The  information  and  knowledge  combined  with  technology  not  only  helps  in  matching  user’s  needs with knowledge resources, but also helps in  taking  decisions  in  the  wide  perspectives  of  global  importance. 
Keeping  this  in  view,  CSIR  renamed  the  libraries  as  Knowledge  Resource  Centres  in  2008,  for  providing  information  support  to  the  scientific/ technical  staff  of  the  CSIR  laboratories  using  both  archival  and  contemporary  digital  resources  for  libraries. In this context, CSIR brought out a Manual1 of Procedures and Practices with the main objective  of  helping  library  professionals  of  CSIR  in  matters  of  standardisation  and  harmonising  the  prevailing  procedures and practices w.r.t. financial, purchase,  and  management  aspects.

2.    ObjeCTIve 
The  main  objective  of  this  explorative  and  descriptive  study  is  to  review  the  current  status  of  41  CSIR  libraries  (including  2  units  and  1  CSIR  HQrs)  along  with  the  emerging  issues  and  future  trends.  For  convenience  sake  CSIR  libraries  will  simply  be  termed  as  normal  ‘libraries’  throughout  the  text. 
3.    MeThOdOLOgy  
With  a  view  to  solicit  up-to-date  information  and  useful  input  from  libraries,  a  questionnaire  was  prepared  which  was  divided  in  to  various  headings as major components, viz., basic information,  infrastructure, budget, staff, membership and collection  details, users services/facilities and projects. Besides  these  components,  the  views  of  librarians/HODs  regarding  knowledge  management  (KM)  initiatives  taken,  problems/issues  faced  by  them,  and  the  perceived  future  challenges  were  also  sought.  The  questionnaire  was  sent  as  an  attachment  file  at  e-mail  addresses  to  librarians/HODs  working  in  their  respective  CSIR  labs. A  complete  list  of  such  labs is available at http://csir.res.in/external/heads/ aboutcsir/lab_directory.htm.  Out  of  41  respondents  the  filled  in  questionnaires  were  received  from  21  libraries.  For  remaining  libraries  the  respective  websites  were  visited  to  collect  required  data/ information  wherever  available. 
3.1  Limitations  of  Study 
(a) In some cases of the libraries, the data pertaining  
to infrastructure, collection and equipment, and  
budget  with  breakups,  could  not  be  traced  
since the same were not readily available even  
in  Annual  reports,  though  the  total  budget  
figures  of  the  labs  have  been  provided  with  
few  exceptions.  
(b) In  almost  all  the  libraries,  the  latest  annual  
reports  were  not  available  either  in  print  or  
e-form  on  the  websites,  so  the  figures  for  
infrastructure may not be up to date particularly  
those  pertaining  to  budget  data. 
(c) In  the  text  at  many  places,  names  of  certain  
labs  have  been  indicated  as  examples  only.  It  
is  possible  that  there  may  exist  more  number  
of labs falling under the respective category in  
a particular context, so the same may be taken  
as  representative  and  not  the  exhaustive  list.  
4. AnALySIS 
4.1  Infrastructure 
Almost all the libraries provide the basic details  like uRL/website presence, e-mail address, facebook  address  (if  any),  other  social  media  presence,  memberships,  and  whether  any  branch/regional  
centre of the same exists. These libraries have their  own  separate  website  with  links  on  the  homepage  of  the  lab  except  a  few,  e.g.,  NISTADS,  IGIB,  etc.,  which  are  described  along  with  the  home  page  of  the lab itself with the help of some links. Regarding  facebook or social media presence only a few libraries,  e.g.,  CSMCRI,  NBRI,  and  NISCAIR  have  included  the  same  in  their  areas  of  activities.  Regarding  membership all the libraries are members of National  Knowledge Resource Centre (NKRC) included as the  one of the projects of NISCAIR and a few libraries  like  NISTADS  and  CSIR  HQrs  are  members  of  DELNET  and  CLRI  for  MALIBNET  (Madras  Library  Network)  also.  Almost  all  the  libraries  have  their  own  buildings  though  the  area  varies  from  528  to  25,000 sq.m. Seating capacity in the libraries range  from  4  to  200  users  maximum.  Regarding  library  membership, there are 4 categories of membership,  viz.,  faculty,  researchers,  students,  and  staff. Total  library members vary from 9 to 1700 with maximum  percentage  share  of  staff  category.  Regarding  IT  infrastructure,  almost  every  library  has  computers,  printers,  and  scanners  with  either  wi-fi  or  LAN  facilities and internet connections. The total numbers  of  such  equipments  vary  from  5  to  41  depending  on  the  budget  of  the  respective  library. 
4.2  Library  budget  
Due  to  non  availability  of  clear  cut  figures  for  library  books,  journals  and  other  print  and  digital  material, a total budget for books and journals were  collected. This figure varies from Rs. 32 to 169 lakh.  It  is  observed  that  in  many  cases  this  is  clubbed  with  total  budget  for  other  staff  also.  Similar  is  the  case  with  figures  for  IT  infrastructure’s  budget. 
4.3  Staff  
The staff strength of libraries varies from 3 to 17  while  most  of  the  libraries  have  less  than  10  staff  members.  There  is  also  a  practice  of  nominating  senior  scientist  as  the  HOD  or  coordinator  for  the  respective  library.  Also  for  the  rush  work  and  routine  jobs  hiring  of  temporary  staff  as  outsource  is  not  uncommon. 
4.4  Collection 
There  are  variety  of  library  material  in  print  as  well  as  digital/audiovisual  form.  However,  the  print  material  dominates.  The  print  collection  of  books  varies  from  1620  to  87000.  The  latest  breakup  figures  for  other  types  of  material,  i.e.,  journals,  reports,  conference  proceedings  and  digital  media  could  not  be  made  available.  
5. SeRvICeS And  FACILITIeS 
There  are  wide  range  of  services  being  made  available by libraries. The most common services in  large number libraries are: Online searches, readers  
161

DJLIT,  VOL.  35,  NO.  3,  MAy  2015 
services;  opac;  reading  room;  photocopy  service;  reference/referral  service;  book  reservation,  book  renewal;  links  of  open  access  resources  in  library  website; and databases. some of the services like,  union  catalogue,  document  delivery  services,  and  translation share the facilities of NISCAIR. Education  and training services are common to all the labs as  part of AcSIR (Academy for Scientific and Innovative  Research) programme for which libraries mainly the  support function, besides in-house, attachment, and  short  term  training  programme  of  certain  libraries  like  NISCAIR,  and  uRDIP,  etc.  Besides  this  brief  sketch  of  common  services,  some  of  services  and  facilities  deserve  more  attention  and  elaboration  which  are  as  follows: 
5.1  Circulation 
This, being a most basic service, would continue  till  the  print  literature  is  available.  Regarding  the  current status for automated circulation system the  bar  code-based  circulation  is  mostly  in  practice.  For  example,  CFTRI,  IHBT,  IIIM,  IMTECH,  NAL,  NIEST, NPL, CSIR HQ, and CSIR-Madras complex  are  using  this  type  of  circulation.  However,  a  few  libraries  like  CGCRI,  CIMFR,  and  NCL  have  also  adopted  RFID  technology. 
5.2  Online  Public Access  Catalogue  (OPAC) 
Almost all the libraries have created their databases  using  one  or  the  other  of  the  integrated  library  automation  systems.  This  facility  is  used  mostly  on  intranet  and  for  walk-in  users  to  the  respective  libraries. Among  the  libraries  adopting  Web  OPAC,  CBRI, CCMB, CDRI, CECRI, CFTRI, CIMAP, CLRI,  IIP,  NIEST,  and  NPL  are  worth  mentioning. 
5.3  document  delivery 
This is one of the oldest services of libraries. With  the spurt of institutions websites, this manual service  has been replaced with the electronic documents which  are  stored  on  the  server  and  providing  link  to  the  requester to pick it up. Alternatively the same can be  sent as mail attachment, which seems to be simpler.  Almost all the libraries are delivering documents to  their clientele which includes Inter-library-loan (ILL)  also. NISCAIR is using this service on a large scale  not  only  its  own  resources  from  National  Science  Library (NSL), but also usitising other national and  international  resources,  e.g.,  BLLD.  
5.4  Reference  to  Referral  Services 
There has been a long practice of offering this  type of service using the print reference tools which  may still continue for some time. However, with the  availability  of  access  to  the  internet  resources  to  every user, the user prefers to seek information for  his/her needs over internet. But the popular search  engines may not cater to the specific users/customised  
162 
requirements. So, the links to various reference tools  for  specific  subjects/areas  of  knowledge  available  on  internet  are  provided  from  library/lab  server  to  cater  to  the  specialist’s  requirements. 
5.5 database  and bibliographic  Search 
Despite the trend for directly accessing full-text  journals, the importance of bibliographical searches  will  continue,  since  they  are  more  comprehensive  and cover various publishers, document types, etc.  Both commercial and non-commercial bibliographic  databases exist today. Though these databases are  available in various forms-CDs, online, besides print  but can be searched with standard techniques only  to  retrieve  desired  information.  
For convenient search, some vendors have come  to  rescue  by  harvesting  bibliographic  information  from  different  resources,  making  it  available  for  the benefit of their users. The retrieved information  then  provides  researchers  the  facility  for  opening  the full-text document who have obtained the rights  for  the  concerned  publisher.  In  this  context,  many  publishers are providing a search interfaces of their  databases-bibliographic  or  full-text  through  cross- referencing  mechanisms. 
5.6 news  Clipping  Services 
Recently, many libraries have started web-based  News  Clipping  service. The  better  option  would  be  to  assign  one  of  the  libraries  the  responsibility  of  collecting  such  information  from  different  sources  including  web  resources.  Then  the  same  could  be  shared  with  rest  of  the  libraries  thus  facilitating  their access through website. However, establishing  such  service  in  its  own  niche  domain  to  cater  to  select  clientele  is  not  uncommon.  As  an  example,  CECRI,  CGCRI,  CSMCRI,  IHBT,  IIIM,  IRTC,  NAL,  NBRI,  and  NPL  have  been  following  this  practice. 
5.7  Translation  Services 
NISCAIR  is  the  unique  institution  to  provide  and  maintain  this  service  out  of  all  the  libraries.  It  covers translation of S&T documents from 20 foreign  languages  into  English.  The  languages  include  Chinese,  French,  German,  and  Japanese  etc.  The  clients include R&D labs, S&T institutes, universities,  research  scholars,  etc.  NISCAIR  also  provides  reverse  translation  (English  into  foreign  language)  though  up  to  a  maximum  one  page.  Translation  of  full  English  documents  into  Japanese  and  also  the  interpretation  and  consultancy  assignments  in  Japanese  language  is  a  unique  service.  
All  libraries  rely  on  NISCAIR  for  any  specific  requirement of translations pertaining to their subject  areas.  Some  of  the  libraries  like  CDRI,  CIMAP,  and  SERC  (Chennai)  also  outsource  or  depend  on  NISCAIR  sometimes  for  rush  work.

5.8  Library/KRC-related  Projects  
5.8.1  National  Knowledge  Resource  Centre 
The National Knowledge Resource Centre (NKRC)  is a network of libraries and information centres of  39 CSIR and 24 DST institutes. It facilitates access  to more than 5,000 e-journals of leading publishers  along  with  patents,  standards,  and  bibliographic  databases. Apart from licensed resources, it is also  a single point entity that provides a large variety of  open access resources. NISCAIR’s NKRC project is  shared  with  all  the  libraries  as  nodal  points.  
5.8.2  Digital  Information  Resource  Facility  
 With a view to overcoming the unorganised way  of hosting data and services on the servers and to  ensure uninterrupted backup service, NISCAIR has  proposed to set up a project on Digital Information  Resource  Facility  ( DIRF)  as  an  integrated  facility.  The  resources  include  NISCAIR  online  journals,  subscribed CSIR E-Journal consortium under NKRC  and  many  other  digital  resources  databases.  The  project  aims  to  provide  an  integrated  state-of-art  facility for managing and sharing digital information  resources  of  CSIR.  
5.8.3  CSIR  KNOWGATE  Project 
It is an open source private cloud infrastructure  (KNOWGATE)  network  project  under  information  sciences cluster. The main objectives are to: Enhance  the  capacity  and  capability  of  CSIR  computing  power and provide CSIR KRCs an integrated library  management  solution  using  OSS.  Other  services  include catalogue sharing, ILL, and referral service  for document supply services. Currently, it contains  more than 4 lakh records, 12 CSIR labs have made  their  OPAC  public,  data  of  14  CSIR  KRCs  have  been migrated to Koha. There is also a provision of  training  on  Linux,  MySQL,  CSIRCat  (KOHA,  CSIR  Virtual  union  Catalogue)  including  demonstration  on  CSIR  Cloud  &  CSIRTrend  modules.  For  further  details  are  available  at  NISCAIR  website6.  
5.8.4  Special  Services 
Some special services also exist with few libraries.  These  are:  Security  surveillance  system  of  CCMB;  Digitisation (by NIO), DTP, Impact factor and Citation  analysis (by CCMB and IHBT), Institutional repository  (by CCMB, CECRI, IMMT, NEERI, and NPL), Marketing  of  information  products  and  services  (by  CFTRI,  IIIM,  IMTECH,  and  NISCAIR,  uRDIP)  and  other  labs  which  are  in  the  process  of  the  same.  
A  typical  service  by  IMMT  pertains  to  internet  service by providing ‘Daily alert about site of interest’.  RFID is also being practiced only in a few libraries  e.g., CBRI, CGCRI, CIMFR, and CSIR HQ, and NCL  where  readers  can  use  self-operated  RFID  kiosk  installed  for  issue/return  of  documents.  
6.  ISSueS 
6.1 document  Copy  Supply  and  Copyright 
An important issue while rendering this service  is  related  to  pricing  mechanism  and  copyright  aspect.  The  CSIR  guidelines  say  that  “The  CSIR  libraries  including  NISCAIR  should  not  charge  if  the requests are received from other CSIR libraries  for  their  own  use  and  if  the  material  is  supplied  from  their  own  resources.  Secondly,  the  charges  for  the  supply  of  the  document  to  other  institutes  other  than  CSIR  depend  on  the  policies  of  the  concerned  KRC.  However,  it  may  be  ensured  that  this is done under the ‘fair use’ clause of copyright  act.’’  It  implies  that  while  supplying  the  required  document  to  the  researchers,  an  undertaking  to  the  effect  that  the  same  will  be  used  purely  for  the research purpose and not used for commercial  purpose,  should  be  taken.  
6.2  Knowledge  Management  Initiatives  
Though CSIR itself renamed libraries as KRCs  during  2008,  the  same  have  yet  to  demonstrate  as  truly  KRC.  There  are  instances  of  taking  up  ambitious  projects  like  KNOWGATE,  DIRF,  and  CSIR-Harvester,  most  of  the  libraries  are  yet  to  take  initiatives  to  organise  and  share  information  to make it knowledge product. In this direction, the  librarians can at least record, digitise, organise and  make available this knowledge for future use. It can  be  in  explicit  or  even  in  tacit  form  held  with  the  scientists, who accumulate a lot of knowledge based  on their long experience. A typical example of CBRI  library  which  has  mentioned  in  the  questionnaire  under  ’KM  initiative’  as  ‘Database  management  of  entire collection plus full-text database of CBRI IR’  is  cited  here  for  information’’ 
6.3  Library  Staff 
The  various  levels  and  categories  of  libraries,  with collections of different sizes, performing different  functions  of  varying  dimensions,  offering  services  starting  from  traditional  to  electronic  require  an  effective change in all facets of its operations, and  the key to that shift is the staff. Within this type of  structure, it may not be justified to propose a single  solution for all the CSIR libraries/KRCs. However, there  should be adequate qualified/competent manpower  to  effectively  manage  the  libraries.  Some  factors  which  can  be  taken  in  to  account  may  be  the  size  of  library  collection  with  annual  additions;  S&T  staff  strength,  the  library  and  lab  budget,  working  hours,  services  offered,  number  of  projects,  extent  of  computerisation,  reprographic/translation  unit  (inhouse  or  outsourcing),  and  number  of  research  students/fellows, etc. In this context an attempt has  been  made  to  present  an  overview  of  library  staff  vs.  the  infrastructural  facilities  (Table  1)  for  CSIR

libraries  at  a  glance.  It  is  observed  that  there  is  no  definite  set  of  pattern  or  trend  in  allocation  of  budget. It would be interesting to study the pattern  for  overall  budget  of  the  labs  and  the  percentage  share of libraries vis-a-vis the pre-defined performance  indicators  for  the  library  or  KRC  besides  revenue  generation part. This is, however, beyond the scope  of  the  present  review  study 
6.4  Institutional  Repositories 
Institutional  repositories  (IRs)  as  type  of  open  access  initiatives  provide  visibility  for  the  research  outputs  of  the  institutes.  While  some  labs  have  already developed, some are in process of developing  IRs, some have already given the links to the full- texts of their publications as html links.

would  go  a  long  way  in  implementation  of  IRs  of  the  respective  labs  provided  that  all  the  libraries  take  initiatives  to  develop  their  own  IR  to  make  it  more  effective. 
6.5  Website  and  Content  development 
Traditionally, all librarians have been trained in  collecting, organising and archiving information and  therefore they can efficiently undertake this activity.  This may include various aspects of information like  projects,  manpower,  FAQs  on  functions,  facilities,  services, news and events, data/literature published  by  the  CSIR  laboratories,  etc.  They  can  contribute  substantially in webpage creation and development  and  coordinate  with  webmaster  and  IT  experts  in  technical  matters.  While  collecting  data  by  visiting  the  respective  websites  it  has  been  observed  that  
165 

========6========

DJLIT,  VOL.  35,  NO.  3,  MAy  2015 
there is large inconsistency in organising information  on  the  web  pages.  For  example,  in  some  cases  a  description  about  library  is  found  under  the  link  ‘About  us’  or  ‘Management’  and  for  others  in  the  ‘Services’  or  ‘Resources’  or  even  under  ‘Right  to  Information Act’ link. There are instances of websites  which merely provide a paragraph giving very brief  information about the library. It is also very common  to separate the information/documentation/publication  and e-resources/services under the heading KRC in  a particular link. Besides this the figures for library  budget  with  breakups  and  equipments  (computers,  printers, and scanners, etc.) are not readily available.  There  are,  however,  some  exceptions  to  libraries  designated  as  national  resource  centres  in  their  subject  domains,  e.g.,  CDRI  (for  drugs),  NIO  (for  marine sciences), NAL (for aerospace technologies),  CFTRI (for food science), NISCAIR, and uRDIP for  information  sciences,  etc.

7.1  Implementing  Knowledge  Management  
Concepts 
There are many techniques to adopt KM concepts,  e.g., maintain information on knowledge repositories,  providing integrated access to information, creating  expert and inventory databases. It would be desirable  to develop links with resources both physical such as  institutions and individuals, and, electronic such as  e-resources available through the internet; capturing  knowledge from projects, assignments, gray literature,  case  studies,  experts,  etc.,  on  given  subjects  and  make them accessible in database form. This must  be supplemented with training component for users  in  accessing  information  and  guiding  the  users  to  appropriate  resource.  Eventually,  a  full-text  KRC  on  topics  in  digital  form  will  get  developed  with  links  and  in-house  resources  all  ready  for  use  of  the  users  24  hours  throughout  the  year.  So  the  libraries  have  to  deliver  and  prove  the  values.  As  Anderson2   has  pointed  out,  “unless  we  give  our  funding bodies better and more compelling reasons  to support libraries, they will be forced by economic  reality  to  stop  doing  so.” 
7.2 digitisation 
The institute’s reports and other grey literature  can be digitised and made available over the network.  Major initiatives like institutional repositories, e-prints  archives, multimedia databases, etc., form part of the  digital libraries. As digital collections grow in number  and  variety,  concerns  grow  about  the  general  lack  of  long-term  planning  for  their  preservation.  So,  a  time  bound  strategic  planning  and  implementation  of  establishing  standards  for  creating,  accessing,  and  preserving  digital  content  should  be  prepared  so  that  an  effective  utilisation  of  ever  expanding  information  resource  is  ensured.

7.3 use  of  Mobile devices 
Mobile devices are changing the way information  is  delivered  and  accessed.  An  increasing  number  of libraries provide services and content delivery to  mobile  devices.  In  this  context  a  reference  is  here  made of the 2011 Pew Internet Project which finds  that 25 % of uS adults with smart phones use them  as  their  primary  information  source3.  
7.4  Changing user behaviours  and  
expectations 
Convenience  affects  all  aspects  of  information  seeking-the selection, accessibility, and use of sources.  Libraries usually are not the first source for finding  information.  When  queried,  respondents  describe  the  library  as  ‘hard  to  use,’  ‘the  last  resort,’  and  ‘inconvenient.’ Convenience is a significant factor in  both academic and everyday-life information-seeking  situations4. With the widespread use of the internet  and  search  engines  such  as  Google,  individuals  have  little  or  no  problem  finding  sources.  Since  libraries  are  now  competing  for  user  attention,  the  current challenge is to provide immediate, seamless  access to sources and information to remain in the  game.  Smith  &  Pickett5   stated,  “The  new  library  should  be  based  on  the  just-in-time  model,  where  access  is  more  important  than  vast  quantities  of  nearby  inventory”5.

Libraries  have  always  been  considered  as  an  integral part of their parent institutions. However, some  of  the  CSIR  libraries  which  fall  under  Information  Science  Group  like  National  Science  Library  of  NISCAIR,  and  information  unit  of  uRDIP,  have  to  play an extra role for providing information services  to whole CSIR labs through the respective networked  projects  and  also  to  cater  to  their  own  labs.  The  libraries in other labs, however, mainly cater to the  needs  of  their  respective  labs,  besides  providing  input  to  NISCAIR  and  uRDIP  for  their  networked  projects  from  time  to  time.  NISCAIR  has  not  only  been  serving  S&T  community  but  also  is  aimed  at  helping  all  CSIR  libraries  in  ensuring  optimum  utilisation  of  resources  through  its  various  projects  e.g.,  the  KNOWGATE  project.  A  glimpse  of  this  prestigious project is shown in a screenshot (Fig.1)  which depicts various services areas of cooperative  venture  for  CSIR  libraries.  
The CSIR also has a specialised service unit for  Research and Development of Information Products  (uRDIP)  which  is  involved  in  the  pre-research  and  pre-development phase of the research projects by  providing intellectual property and techno-commercial  information  services  (www.urdip.res.in).  It  provides  value-added  information  services  to  wide  array  of  clients.  The  uRDIP  also  is  a  national  centre  for

hosting and providing service entitled ‘CSIR-CENTRAL’  which is a centralised institutional repositories hosting  service  for  CSIR  labs  and  a  harvester  service  for  CSIR  institutional  repositories.  Some  of  the  labs  have  developed  a  complete  information  system  in  their  knowledge  domain  which  have  been  formally  designated  as  national  centres  in  their  respective  areas,  e.g.,  NAL  for  aerospace  information  known  as  Information  Centre  for  Aerospace  Technology  (ICAST);  CFTRI  for  food  science  and  technology,  namely,  Food  Science  and  Technology  Information  system (FOSTIS), NIO as centre for marine sciences  called National Information Centre for Marine Sciences  (NICMAS), etc. These information centres rely heavily  on  their  respective  libraries  for  continued  support.  Figure.  2  reflects  the  NAL’s  ICAST  services. 
The current status of CSIR libraries w.r.t resources  and  infrastructure  reminds  us  that  there  should  be  some  objective  criteria  of  allocation  for  optimum  utilisation  of  the  same  from  CSIR  administration  point  if  view.  However,  from  librarians  point  of  view,  their  focus  should  be  on  providing  effective  
dissemination  of  information  services  be  it  related  to  networking  projects  or  routine  jobs  demanding  initiatives  from  their  side.  Libraries  have  generally  been  criticized  for  overspending  in  terms  of  cost  effectiveness  of  its  services.  However,  the  other  important  component,  i.e.,  cost  benefit  analysis  now  requires  more  attention  to  prove  their  worth  particularly  in  the  global  IT  based  services.  
From the various issues mentioned above, it is  observed  that  some  of  the  services  related  to  the  areas such as translation, newspaper clippings, and KM  initiatives have not been adopted in large scale and  there exists lack of concerted efforts in coordination  of  the  same  at  one-CSIR  level  compared  to  other  networked projects. So it implies that here has to be  a  proper  balance  between  resources,  and  services  offered  much  like  a  symbiotic  relationship.

An  overview  of  status,  issues  and  possible  trends  for  CSIR  libraries  as  reflected  in  the  main  text  ultimately  points  out  the  major  responsibility  towards  the  librarians.  There  are  many  challenges  before them, out of which the main concern is how  to  survive  and  sustain  their  position  as  one  of  the  important  and  crucial  stakeholders  in  the  process  of  S&T  information  dissemination.  
There  are  of  course  various  constraints  and  limitations  directed  by  administration  and  finance.  For  example,  one  of  the  main  characteristics  of  CSIR  libraries  is  how  to  support  and  ensure  their  respective labs in minimum 30% revenue generation  out  of  the  sanctioned  budget.  unless  they  come  out with more and more knowledge products in this  competitive information society their supporting and  intermediary  role  will  be  diminished.  So,  there  has  to be a constant effort to develop their skills by not  only attending seminars, workshops and short term  training courses, but also practically implement the  various techniques, and methods and at least evaluate  websites  for  streamlining  information  organisation  and content development to the maximum possible  extent.  In  this  way  the  libraries  will  be  recognised  as  true  knowledge  resource  centres.
