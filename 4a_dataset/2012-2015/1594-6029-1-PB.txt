ABSTRACT
The present article is a web survey of Library web pages of different Universities as well as Institutes
of National Importance web sites of the state of West Bengal regarding application of Web 2.0 technology
and tools to enhance library services to patrons. Brief introduction to different Web 2.0 tools such as Blog,
Wiki, RSS, Podcast, etc. is given. Based on the analysis of collected data, a few questions are raised to be
dug deeper into the malady of present condition.
Keywords: Blog, Wiki, RSS, podcast, social bookmarking, myspace, facebook, West Bengal

1. INTRODUCTION
The conventional web or Web 1.0 was a centralised idea in
the sense that it was solely one way traffic. There was no scope
for seamless user interaction. With the introduction of Web 2.0
democratic decentralisation of web has taken place. The web
today in true sense is a people’s web. Suddenly user generated
contents have taken centre stage. The web no more stands for
sites and search engines but now it means a shared network
space that drives education, research, work and social
activities. The obvious outcome is a ‘net generation’ or
‘millennials’ or ‘digital natives’1. Libraries especially academic
libraries need to consider the profile of these digital natives. In
order to provide effective services to these new generation of
patrons, especially in university libraries, different awareness
activities like organising seminars, conducting study circles,
publishing journal articles, and annual conferences are being
organised regularly in different parts of India. So that library
professionals can readily identify that Web 2.0 technology is
the next big thing in academic libraries.
Amid these developments, the present article which is
basically a web survey has put an effort to understand how far
university libraries and libraries of Institutes of higher learning in
West Bengal actually implemented Web 2.0 tools to enhance
the library services towards Web 2.0 savvy patrons.

2. WEB 2.0
The term Web 2.0 was first conceptualised and
coined by Tim O”Reilly in 2004 to give an understanding of

the design pattern and business models for the next
generation web software2. Web 2.0 highlights the value of
user generated contents. Wikipedia says, ‘the term
encapsulates the idea of the proliferation of
interconnectivity and interactivity of web delivered
contents’3. Blog, Wiki, RSS, Podcast, social
bookmarking, MySpace or Facebook are very popular
Web2.0 technologies. A blog or weblog refers to a
webpage where entries are added in chronological order
and displayed in reverse chronological order. Librarians
can use blogs to inform about ongoing and forthcoming
events and also as a form of publication.
A Wiki is an editable webpage and can be edited by
anybody who has access. A wiki in a University can
support collaborative knowledge creation and sharing2.
The RSS stands for really simple syndication or rich site
summary. It is a Web 2.0 technology which consists of a
group of web feed formats used to publish frequently
updated content and permits users to check updates
without actually visiting a website. Libraries with RSS
feed facility can update their new items or collections
available for users. The next is podcast, ‘a digital media
file or a related collection of such files which is distributed
over internet using syndication feeds for playback on a
portable media player and personal computers’1.
In an academic library podcast can be used to provide
access to lecture videos or audiobooks to those students
who could not attend the class. Another Web 2.0

technology i.e, social bookmarking allows users to create
common lists of favourites, store them in a remote server in
order to access that list anytime from anywhere.
Del.icio.us, a social bookmarking tool that can be used
by libraries to enable patrons to share web resources.
MySpace and facebook enable a librarian to reach
especially to young patrons. So it is clear that these Web
2.0 tools and technologies provide ample scope for a
librarian to take library services to a new height.

3. PURPOSE OF SURVEY
The aim of this web survey is to have a clear picture
about the extent of implementation of Web 2.0 technologies
in university library websites in West Bengal. It also tries to
understand how university libraries are responding to the
much talked about phenomenon namely social networking.

4. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
The survey considered the universities of West
Bengal. As National Institute of Technology (NIT)
Durgapur, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur,
and Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata have similar
status, so these institutes of higher learning were also
considered. The survey was conducted during the period
from 22-07-2010 to 02-08-2010. Since web world is a

dynamic where changes in content of a web page or
services may take place at any time, later developments
at any site should not be taken as contrary to the
information provided in this survey.

5. METHODOLOGY
List of recognised universities and details about them
were collected from official website of University Grants
Commission4 as well as from Universities handbook7.
Existing websites of these universities were visited. In a
university website, library homepage was searched for. If
available, efforts were made to find out and detect any
popular Web 2.0 icon like RSS, blog, twitter, etc. All the
available links in the library page were followed and
studied and the observations were noted down in tabular
form. Data gathered in the tabular form were then carefully
analysed to get a clear picture of the use of Web 2.0 tools
in library webpage of the universities under consideration.

6. COLLECTION OF DATA
Collection of data for various universities and institutes of
National importance in West Bengal is as shown in Table 1.
Table 2 shows the library webpage status with link and

seen to be using ‘RSS feed’, ‘iGoogle’, and
‘MyYahoo’. IIT, Kharagpur library blog was last
updated on 17/05/2010 and no other further activity till
date. Therefore, it is clear that the potentiality of the
blog in the library has not been explored in its full
extent so far. There was a RSS icon on library
homepage but it remained non-functional as clicking
the icon could not retrieve the desired URL. On the
other, hand ISI appeared to be experimenting with
different Web 2.0 tools such as RSS feed from ‘the
free dictionary’ featuring ‘word of the day’, ‘article of
the day’, ‘spelling bee’, etc. ISI also at length
discussed about utility of various Web 2.0 tools under
the link ‘Library Widget’ for users.

The URLs of the blog and RSS used by Indian Institute
of Technology, Kharagpur are as follows:
Blog—http://www.library.iitkgp. ernet.in/?q=blog/1. This
blog was last updated on 17/05/2010.
RSS feed to the above blog is http://www.libr
ary.iitkgp.ernet.in/?q=blog/ 1/feed
Central
library
RSS—http://library.iitkgp.ernet.in/
?q=rss.xml. On clicking the RSS icon ‘requested URL
could not be retrieved’ message was shown.
Indian Statistical Institute has subscribed to RSS feed of
the free dictionary with the URL link as follows: http://
www.thefreedictionary.com/_/WoD/rss.aspx. ISI is also
using iGoogle widget and link to MyYahoo which is a
customisable webpage with multiple features.

7. ANALYSIS OF COLLECTED DATA
•

•

It is clear from table that there are altogether 18 UGCrecognised state universities in West Bengal, of which
Calcutta University is the oldest (established in the
year 1857). Netaji Subhas Open University is the only
open university in the state. There is one central
university, namely, Visva Bharati and three other
institutes of national importance (Indian Institute of
Technology, Kharagpur; Indian Statistical Institute,
Kolkata; and National Institute of Technology,
Durgapur).
Out of 18 state universities five universities do not
have any dedicated library webpage, though these
universities maintain and update their official websites
regularly. North Bengal University does not have any
dedicated library webpage but very brief information
regarding library can be accessed through the
‘facility.html’ file. Uttar Banga Krishi Vishwavidyalaya
has library link but on clicking the link, the URL (http:/
/www.ubkv.ac.in/library.htm) could not be retrieved
(404 Not Found error).
None of the 11 state universities maintaining their
library webpage, has so far applied Web 2.0 tools.
Visva Bharati, the only Central University in West
Bengal, is no different from them. National Institute of
Technology, Durgapur, though is an Institute of
National Importance specialising in engineering and
technology yet has shown indifference to the
application of Web 2.0 tools in library webpage.
Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur and Indian
Statistical Institute, Kolkata, have applied Web 2.0
tools in their corresponding library webpages. Indian
Institute of Technology was noticed to be using ‘Blog’
and ‘RSS’ whereas Indian Statistical Institute was

8. CONCLUSIONS
A dismal picture of West Bengal regarding application
of Web 2.0 technology and tools in library webpages of
universities and institutes of national importance has
been revealed. Now is the time to give a, serious thought
as to what could have prevented the University libraries to
use Web 2.0 tools. Was it due to lack of awareness?
Were they much interested to maintain status quo?
Whether they were facing shortage of manpower or could
not gain proper expertise in due course of time in this
particular segment? Did any bureaucratic hurdle hold
them back? Are the students and scholarly community of
West Bengal not aware of the advantages of Web 2.0
technology?
To answer these queries a survey of much bigger
magnitude is required. To keep pace with the citizens of
networked environment and to thwart the possibility of
social isolation, universities of West Bengal need to gear
up to implement those myriad applications of Web 2.0
technologies.
