This paper attempts to highlight the publication status and growth of radioisotope research across the  world and make quantitative and qualitative assessment by way of analysing various features of research  output based on Web of Science database during the period 1993-2012. A total of 31488 publications  were published on radioisotopes, which received 482549 citations. The average number of publications  per year was 1574.40 and the average number of citations per publication was 15.32. The publications  peaked in the year 2012 with 2036 publications and the highest number of citations (33316) was in 1999.  The parameters studied include: year-wise growth of publications and citations, continent-wise distribution  of publications and citations, country-wise distribution of publications, distribution of publications according  to impact factor range, international collaboration, domain-wise distribution of publications and citations,  highly  productive  institutes,  highly  cited  publications  and  highly  preferred  journals  for  publications  by  
scientists.

1.    INTRODUcTION 
Radioisotopes  or  radionuclides  are  radioactive  forms  of  elements  and  are  usually  produced  in  research reactors and accelerators. They have wide  ranging applications in healthcare, industry, food &  agriculture and environmental monitoring. Following  over five decades of vast experience accumulated,  radioisotope  technology  has  developed  to  a  high  degree  of  sophistication  and  it  is  estimated  that  about  200  radioisotopes  are  in  regular  use.  
Scientometrics  is  a  discipline  which  analyses  scientific publications and citations appended to the  papers to gain an understanding of the structure of  science, growth of science at global level, performance  of  a  country  in  a  particular  domain,  performance  of  institutions,  departments/divisions  and  scientific  eminence  of  an  individual  scientist.  It  also  helps  in  knowing  the  information  seeking  behaviour  of  scientists and engineers by way of identifying where  they publish and what they cite. Many scientometric  studies  on  nuclear  science  and  technology  have  been  carried  out.

technology research in India in terms of publication  output as reflected in International Nuclear Information  System (INIS) (1970-2002) database. Kademani2, et al.,  have  done  detailed  quantitative  analysis  of  Indian  contributions on thorium in terms of publications output  as  per  INIS  database  during  1970-2004. A  total  of  2399 papers were published by the Indian scientists  in  the  field  of  thorium.  Kademani3,  et  al .,  carried  out  a  study  on  world  literature  on  thorium  in  terms  of publication output as per Science Citation Index  (1982-2004). A total of 3987 papers were published.  The  study  also  identified  the  highly  productive  institutions, extent of international collaboration, most  prolific  authors  in  the  field,  etc.  Kademani4, et  al .,  have  analysed  65592  publications  on  zirconium   in  nuclear  science  and  technology  using  the  INIS  database  as  a  tool.  The  study  focused  on  the  broad  features  of  zirconium  literature  such  as  year-wise  distribution  of  publications,  country-wise  distribution  of  publications,  country-wise  activity  index,  domain-wise  distribution  of  publications  and  highly  productive  institutions.  Sagar5,  et  al. ,  have  presented  the  growth  of  literature  on  cobalt-60  research in nuclear science and technology by way  of analysing various characteristic of research output  such  as  the  growth  of  publications,  geographical

distribution of publications, publication productivity- wise  distribution  of  publications.  There  is  a  lot  of  research  being  carried  out  all  over  the  world  in  the  field  of  radioisotopes  and  their  applications  in  various  fields  such  as  healthcare,  industry,  food  and  agriculture,  and  environmental  monitoring.  It  was  felt  important  to  carry  out  a  study  as  there  are  not  many  scientometric  studies  conducted  in  the  field  of  radioisotopes. 
3.  ObJecTIveS 
The  objective  of  the  study  is  to  perform  a  scientometric  analysis  of  all  radioisotope  research  publications  in  the  world.  The  parameters  studied  include growth of publications and citations, continent- wise distribution of publications and citations, country- wise distribution of publications, publication efficiency  index, international collaborative index, domain-wise  distribution of publications and citations, specialisation  index, highly productive institutes, quality of research,  identification of highly cited publications and highly  preferred  journals. 
4.    MAT eRIALS AND  MeTHODS 
The  Web  of  Science  database  was  used  for  retrieving data on radioisotopes during 1993-2012, using  search terms namely ‘radioisotope* or radionuclide*’  in  ‘topic’  field.  A  total  of  31488  publications  and  482549  citations  received  to  these  publications  were  transferred  to  spread  sheet  application.  The  bibliographic  fields  were  analysed  by  normal  count procedure for continents, countries, domains,  authorships,  and  journals.  Full  credit  was  given  to  each  continent,  country  regardless  of  whether  it  appears  first  or  last  in  the  author  byline.

5.4   country-wise  Publication efficiency  (PeI) 
Publication Efficiency Index (PEI) is a measure  of research quality2, it indicates whether the impact  of  publications  in  a  country  in  a  research  field  is  compatible  with  the  research  efforts.  The  value  of  PEI  >1  for  a  country  indicates  that  the  impact  of  publications is more than the research effort devoted  to  it  for  that  particular  country  and  vice  versa.

5.5  International  Collaborative  Index  for  Top  
Productive countries 
International collaborative index (ICI)  has been  taken  as  the  proportional  output  of  internationally  co-authored  papers  and  is  an  improvement  over  internationalisation index 7 & 8. The value of ICI = 100  indicate that a country’s collaborative effort corresponds  to  world  average.  ICI  >100  reflects  collaboration  higher  than  world  average  and ICI  <  100  reflects  collaboration  less  than  world  average.

  Where  
li  = Number of internationally co-authored papers  for  country i 
lio   =  Total  output  for  country  i 
io  = Number of internationally co-authored papers  for  all  countries 
ioo   =  Total  output  for  all  countries 
Among  the  30  top  productive  countries,  27  countries  have  very  high  values  (≥100)  of  ICI.  Hungary obtained the highest (109.02 %) international

This  shows  that  the  trend  is  towards  more  international  collaboration.  
1993-2012. Medical Sciences accounts for the largest  share  (38.14  %,  12094  papers)  of  publications  in  the  total  worldwide  output  which  received  263672 (54.64 %) citations, followed by Earth & Environmental  Sciences  (20.69  %,  6515  papers)  and  77382 (16.04  %)  citations;  Chemical  Sciences (15.77  %,  4967  papers)  and  43612  (9.04  %)  citations;  Engineering  Sciences  (7.6  %,  2393  papers)  and  23913  (4.96  %)  citations;  Biological  Sciences  (7.07  %,  2227  papers)  and  39594 (8.21 %) citations, Nuclear Science & Technology 238

5.6  Domain-wise  Distribution  of  Publications  
and citations 
Based on the classification of subject-categories  in Journal Citation Report (JCR)  of Thomson Reuters,  the publication output data of radioisotope research  was classified into 9 broad subjects (Fig. 4) during  
Figure  4. Year-wise  and  subject-wise  distribution  
of publications in radioisotope research. 
(3.93 %, 1238 papers) and 4449 (0.92 %) citations,  Physical Sciences (3.75 %, 1182 papers) and 15875 (3.29  %)  citations;  Food  &  Agriculture  Sciences  (1.72  %,  541  papers)  and  6919  (1.43  %)  citations;  and Multidisciplinary Sciences (1.05 %, 331 papers)  and  7133  (1.48  %)  citations. 
5.7   v ariation  of  Impact  Factors  in  various  
Subjects 
There are many reasons for variation in impact  factor in various subjects. The number of researchers  working in a field is one of the important factors, the  more  number  of  active  researchers  in  a  field  tend  to  receive  more  number  of  citations  than  the  field  with less number of active researchers. The number  of  articles  a  journal  publishes  in  a  year,  number  of  journals  subscribed  by  the  institutes  across  the  world,  number  of  citations  received,  differences  in  the time-lag between the publication and subsequent  citation,  fundamental  and  broad  areas  of  research  tend  to  receive  more  number  of  citations  than  the  narrower  and  applied  areas,  coverage  of  journals  in  citation  database,  etc.  Subject-wise  average  citations  per  publication  is  given  in  Fig.  5. 5.8 Highly  Productive  Institutes

6. cONcLUSIONS 
Radioisotopes  play  a  very  predominant  role  in  healthcare,  industry,  food  and  agriculture,  and  environmental  monitoring,  etc. A  lot  of  research  is  being  carried  out  all  over  the  world  in  this  field.  A  total  of  31488  publications  were  published  on  radioisotopes during 1993-2012 and these publications  received  482549  citations.  The  highest  number  of  publications  2036  (6.47  %)  were  published  in  2012.  The  highest  number  of  citations  33316 (6.90  %)  were  received  in  1999.  The  highest  average  citations  per  publication  was  24.77  in  1993. There were 4421 (14.04 %) publications with  no  citations  during  the  period  under  study.  Overall  collaboration rate (CR) was very high (0.91) as 28729 (91.21 %) publications of the total documents were  multi-authored and the highest collaboration rate (0.94)  was  in  2010  and  2011  respectively  indicates  that  the trend is towards more number of multi-authored  collaborative publications. An exponential growth of  publications  was  observed  in  this  study. 
It was observed that Europe is the most productive  continent  with  18267  (46.75  %)  publications  and  296158 (46.70 %) citations followed by North America  with  10444  (26.73  %)  publications  and  236167  (37.24  %)  citations  and  Asia  with  8202  (20.99  %)  publications  and  71044  (11.2  %)  citations. 
The  uSA  topped  the  list  with  highest  share (29.31 %) of publications. Germany ranked second with  8.16 % share of publications followed by England with  7.44 % share of publications, Japan with 6.97 % share  of  publications  Netherlands  had  the  highest  PEI  (1.93 %) followed by Switzerland with 1.68 %, uSA  with  1.52  %,  Scotland  with  1.47  %, Australia  with 1.4  %,  England  with  1.23  %  and  Canada  with  1.23. 
Hungary had the highest (109.02 %) international  collaborative index followed by Brazil with 107.46 %,  Peoples  R  China  with  107.3  %,  South  Korea  with  107.12  %,  Taiwan  with  106.71  %  and  India  with  105.81  %  indicates  that  these  countries  more  international  collaboration  in  this  field.

Russian  Academy  of  Sciences-Russia  topped  the  list  with  429  publications  and  3.57  average  citations per publication followed by Atomic Energy  Alternative  Energies  Commission  CEA-France  with  396  publications  and  12.7  citations  per  publication  and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre-India with 284  publications  and  6.74  citations  per  publication. 
90.9  %  (28624)  of  the  total  publications  were  published  in  the  journals  with  impact  factors  (IF)  ranging  from  00.01  to  153.46  and  received  92.32  %  (445480)  citations,  and  9.1  %  (2864)  publications were published in journals having zero  impact  factor. 
The scientific research in radioisotopes is spread  over 3391 different journals. More than 60 % of the  publications were published in only 173 key-journals,  indicates that they are the core journals where the  important  research  results  are  published.
