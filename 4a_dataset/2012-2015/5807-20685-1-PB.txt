Development of the internet and the world wide web has made impact on the libraries like never  before.  Ownership  of  documents  has  given  way  to  access,  forcing  a  rethinking  of  the  functions  and  services to be performed by libraries for providing the specifc documents/information needed by users  from  the  ocean  of  digital  resources.  One  such  service  designed  to  provide  access  to  evaluated,  and  selected information resources pertaining to a particular subject feld is the subject gateway service. This  article traces the development of subject gateways from 1999 till 2013 and critically studies the longest  surviving  subject  gateways.  It  shows  that  the  most  critical  feature  expected  of  a  subject  gateway,  i.e.,  evaluation of resources prior to selection, is missing in majority of the subject gateways.

1.    IntroDUctIon 
The networked environment has brought about a  change in the concept of the ‘collection’ of the modern  library. Today’s libraries are termed ‘Libraries without  walls’,  essentially  because  they  serve  their  users  not only with the help of the collection painstakingly  built  up  on  their  shelves,  but  also  with  the  help  of  ‘externally  located  collections’,  meaning  resources  held  on  remote  servers  and  accessed  through  the  internet. Ownership has given way to access, more  so  in  the  context  of  digital  resources.  
By  late  twentieth  century,  the  web  had  been  flooded with a plethora of information resources on  each  and  every  topic.  Serious  thought  began  the  world  over  regarding  how  to  manage  the  growing  web-based resources. Two lines of action emerged  in  the  decade  from  1991-2000.  The  first  was  the  initiation  of  web  preservation  projects  to  preserve  the  contents  of  this  new,  ever-changing  medium  for  historical  and  scholarly  research  use.  Several  web  preservation  projects  began  in  1996  with  the  National  Libraries  taking  the  lead.  Understanding  the Herculean efforts involved in web preservation,  several  collaborative  projects  were  later  initiated.  
The second activity undertaken to have bibliographic  control  over  the  internet  resources  was  the  setting  up  of  subject  gateways.  This  option  supported  access to remote resources over ownership. Rather  than relying upon the unpredictable internet search  engines  to  fetch  resources,  it  was  thought  fit  to  provide  access  to  useful  resources  using  quality- controlled  databases  of  resource  descriptions.

2.    DefInItIonS 
 According to Lorcan Dempsey 
1, “Subject gateways  are  internet  services  which  support  systematic  resource discovery. They provide links to resources  (documents, objects, sites or services) predominantly  accessible via the internet. The service is based on  resource description. Browsing access to the resource  via  a  subject  structure  is  an  important  feature”.  
The definition given by the IMesh Toolkit project2 is,  "A  subject  gateway  is  a  website  that  provides  searchable and browsable access to online resources  focused around a specific subject. Subject gateway  resource descriptions are usually created manually  rather than being generated via an automated process.  As  the  resource  entries  are  generated  by  hand,  they  are  usually  superior  to  those  available  from  a  conventional  web  search  engine."  The  DESIRE  project3  has defined subject gateways as, "Selective  subject gateways on the internet are characterised by  their quality control. The core activities of resource  selection and description rely on skilled human input  (by librarians, academics and experts) and are not  activities  that  lend  themselves  to  automation." 
The  characteristics  of  a  subject  gateway  can  be  summarised  as: 
(a) An online service that provides links to numerous  
other  sites  or  documents  on  the  internet (b) Manual creation/intervention, often by information  
and/or  subject  specialists  
(c) Selection  of  resources  according  to  published  
quality  and  scope  criteria 
(d) Intellectually produced content descriptions, ranging  
in  length  from  short  annotation  to  review

1999  and  2003  out  of  which  five  were  new:  Altis  (Hospitality,  Leisure,  Sport  and  Tourism),  Artifact  (Arts and Creative Industries), GEsource (Geography  and Environment), Humbul (Humanities) and PSIgate  (Physical Sciences).  Three converted from existing  eLib  gateways  –  ADAM,  BizEd  and  BIOME,  which  was  formed  out  of  OMNI,  EEVL,  and  SOSIG.  
The most significant step that led to the establishment  
(e)   ro ADS  (resource organisation  and  
of  subject  gateways  was  the  review  of  libraries  and  related  provision  in  higher  education  in  UK  
Discovery  in  Subject-based  Services) An impetus to the development of subject gateways  
known  as  the  Follett  Report4.    The  Review  Group  was chaired by Prof Sir Brian Follett. Its membership  included nominees of the four funding bodies, and other  representatives from the higher education and related  sectors. The Review group met at regular intervals  and  its  report,  consisting  of  eight  comprehensive  chapters, was brought out in December 1993. It led  to several initiatives for increasing the effectiveness  of  libraries,  especially  through  the  application  of  IT  for  network  access,  navigation  tools,  electronic  document  storage  and  delivery,  etc.  
(b) DeSIre   (Development  of  a  european  
Service  for  Information  on  research  and  
education) project 
It was a collaborative project among ten institutions  from  four  European  countries–the  Netherlands,  Norway,  Sweden,  and  UK.  It  was  funded  by  the  European  Union.  The  aim  was  to  promote  the  use  of  the  web  within  the  European  Research  Community.  The  DESIRE  project  ran  from  1996- 2000  as  DESIRE  I  and  II.  Phase  2  finished  at  the  end  of  June  2000.  To  support  the  DESIRE  vision  of  a  network  of  European  cross-searchable  information gateways, UKOLN produced the DESIRE  Information Gateways Handbook5. It offered a step  by  step  guide  and  points  to  tools,  examples  and  documentation  which  can  support  the  process  of  setting  up  a  gateway. 
(c)   e lectronic libraries programme  (elib) 
This  was  an  initiative  of  the  Joint  Information  Systems  Committee  (JISC)  of  UK.  The  gateways  established under eLib were SOSIG (Social Science  Information Gateway, which slightly predated eLib, and  acted  as  a  model  for  other  gateways), ADAM  (Art,  Design, Architecture  and  Media),  EEVL  (Edinburgh  Engineering  Virtual  Library),  OMNI  (Organising  Medical Networked Information) and BizEd (Business  Education). 
(d)   r esource  Discovery network  (rDn) 
This  new  service  was  started  in  1999  under  funding  from  JISC  to  maintain  these  gateways  on  a long-term basis and to co-ordinate their activities.  RDN  comprised  eight  gateways  set  up  between  
commissioned  in  1992,  and  the  recommendations  
given in the resulting comprehensive report, popularly  
was  provided  by  the  JISC  funded  collaborative  
project,  ‘ROADS’.  The  purpose  of  ROADS  was  to  
368 
produce  a  software  package  for  setting  up  subject  gateways, to investigate methods of cross-searching  and interoperability, development of standards for the  indexing,  cataloguing  and  searching  of  resources.  The  resulting  ROADS  toolkit,  a  freely  available  system  of  software  and  standards  was  used  for  building  several  eLib  gateways.  
4.   pUrpoSe  of  the  StUDy 
Setting up and sustenance of a subject gateway  is  a  complex  task  involving  a  lot  of  critical  issues.  In  order  to  provide  a  reliable,  responsive,  efficient  and scalable subject gateway service, enablers such  as  network  connectivity,  hardware  configuration,  operating system software, subject gateway database  and  associated  software,  web  server  software  are  necessary.  Some  issues  arise  out  of  the  fact  that  human  intervention  is  involved  in  the  selection,  evaluation and description of resources. Development  of  scope  policy  and  selection  criteria,  hiring  and  training of staff and catalogue development are some  strategic issues. Since a subject gateway represents  web-resources  that  are  dynamic  in  nature,  it  itself  also  has  to  be  dynamic.  New  resources  might  be  added  and  existing  ones  removed.  The  contents  might  undergo  changes  and  the  resources  might  move  to  new  locations  (URL).  This  necessitates  maintenance  of  the  resource  catalogue  (collection  management)  involving  validation  of  records,  link  checking  and  updation  of  resource  descriptions.  If  the gateway service is to be run smoothly, technical  maintenance  of  the  server  is  also  necessary. 
  It  was  thought  necessary  to  investigate  how  subject  gateways,  the  new  service  that  was  set  into  motion  in  1999  has  developed  over  the  years.  How many and which subject gateways were added,  how  long  have  they  been  sustained,  who  has  been  active  in  this  area,  what  is  the  nature  of  the  currently  existing  services  are  some  of  the  issues  which  need  to  be  studied. 
5.   reSeArch methoDoloGy 
To find out how many and which subject gateways  were  set  up  over  the  years,  it  was  decided  to  use  ‘Pinakes: A Subject Launchpad’ website5.  This has  

========2========

KANETKAR: DEVELOPMENT OF  S UBJECT  G ATEwAyS 
been  created  in  order  to  provide  access  to  major,  high-quality  subject  gateways  on  a  wide  range  of  academic subjects and is hosted by the Heriot-watt  University, Edinburgh, Scotland. The list of Subject  gateways displayed on the site is updated regularly,  with  new  ones  added  and  extinct  ones  removed.  Each  subject  gateway  is  represented  by  its  name  and  a  graphic  image.  Links  are  provided  to  the  subject  gateways.  Subject  gateways  are  grouped  in two groups, one consisting of gateways devoted  to  specific  subjects/areas  and  the  other  consisting  of  gateways  covering  all  subjects  (multi-subject  gateways).  
Since the Pinakes webpage reflect only the current  gateways,  the  archived  versions  at  the  wayback  Machine6  were used for obtaining information about the  subject gateways listed from time to time by Pinakes.  The  wayback  Machine  is  an  interface  offered  by  internet archive7  , a non-profit organisation set up in  1996 with the purpose of providing permanent access  to  historical  collections  that  exist  in  digital  format.

The  interface  is  available  for  the  public  to  access  archived  versions.  It  provides  access  to  individual  website snapshots or captures (i.e. the state of the  website  at  that  moment)  and  also  allows  them  to  be  browsed  within  their  historical  context. 
5.1  Data  Selection 
A search for Pinakes on the wayback Machine  revealed  that  444  snapshots  or  captures  existed  over  a  fourteen  year  period,  ranging  from  the  first  capture  on  17  January  1999  and  the  last  capture  taken  on  22  Oct  2013.  This  is  seen  in  Figure  1,  which is a screen dump of the timeline showing the  dates  on  which  snapshots  of  Pinakes    were  taken.  Sixteen  captures  were  selected  for  study,  one  for  each  of  the  fourteen  years,  and  the  first  capture  available at Pinakes (Table 1). The second sample  capture  was  taken  from  the  end  of  1999  (04  Nov  1999), the year when subject gateway service was  initiated to see how it developed over the year. After  that, captures taken on the nearest date during the  following  years  were  selected  as  samples  (e.g.  10  Nov  2000  was  selected  as  third  instance).  Since  the capture on 17 Sep 2009, the next nearest date  gave a ‘not found on the server’ error message, and  there  were  no  more  captures  during  the  year,  the  last  capture  before  17  Sep,  i.e.,  10  Mar  2009  was  
taken  as  the  twelfth  instance.  Thereafter,  captures  nearest  to  this  date  in  the  subsequent  years  were  taken  as  instances.  For  the  year  2013,  the  last  capture  taken  on  22  Oct  2013  was  taken,  since  this  gave  the  latest  picture. 
6.  DAtA  An AlySIS AnD obServAtIonS 
6.1  number  of  Gateways 
It  was  found  that  there  was  a  mention  of  77  gateways  over  the  14  year  period.  However,  14  of  them  underwent  a  name  change  or  were  merged  to  form  new  entities  (with  a  change  in  the  source  and  URL  in  most  cases).  One  gateway  underwent  name change twice (OMNI became BIOME in 2000  and Intute in 2006). It was observed that 63 unique  subject  gateways  were  created.  
The total number of multi-subject gateways listed  was  16.  However,  since  two  of  them  underwent  name change, 14 unique multi-subject gateways were  identified.  Table  2  lists  out  the  subject  gateways  and  multi-subject  gateways  identified  from  sample  captures  from  Pinakes.  
In Table 2, ‘y’ indicates presence of a subject/ multi subject gateway at a particular sample capture,  ‘N’  indicates  its  absence.  years  of  first  and  last  occurrence are according to observations of the sample  captures,  and  might  not  be  the  actual  years.

Total  31  subject  gateways  were  found  existing  on 17 Jan 1999 (first capture). The second sample  capture was taken for 04 Nov 1999, which showed  the addition of 6 new subject gateways. Thus, thirty  36 gateways were identified in 1999. The year 1999  was a watershed year as far as setting up of subject  gateways  is  concerned,  with  the  impetus  provided  by  the  Electronic  Libraries  Programme  (eLib).  The  five  gateways  established  under  eLib  (SOSIG,  ADAM,  EEVL,  OMNI,  and  BizEd)  were  available  at  the  first  capture  (17  January  1999).  
Resource Discovery Network (RDN), which was  formed in 1999 with a few elib gateways and a few  new  ones  was  renamed  ‘Intute’  in  July  2006  and  the  8  subject  gateways  under  it  were  re-organised  under  four  major  subject  groups:  Intute:  Arts  and  Humanities  (Artifact  and  Humbul),  Intute:  Science,  Engineering,  Technology  (EEVL,  GEsource  and  PSIgate), Intute: Health and Life Sciences (BIOME),  Intute:  Social  Sciences  (Altis  and  SOSIG).  Intute  was discontinued in 2011 (the service is to be made  available  till  2013  without  any  updations9). 
There  was  a  spurt  of  activity  in  2005,  with  the  addition  of  5  new  subject  gateways.  The  years  2007-2011  show  no  additions.  Sudden  activity  was  again seen in 2012, when 6 new subject gateways  began.  Out  of  the  63  unique  subject  gateways,  55 (nearly 87 %) were seen in the captures between  1999-2006. Though 36 subject gateways are listed on  the Pinakes webpage at the last capture (22 October  2013), BUBL and Music (BUBL link) were closed down  in 2011, and the sites are no longer updated since  then as per the remark at the websites (http:/bubl. ac.uk  and  http:/link.bubl.ac.uk/music  respectively).  Hence  34  subject  gateways  exist  currently  (as  marked  with  ‘+’  in  Table  2). 
Out of the 14 unique multi-subject gateways, 3  existed  at  the  first  capture  (17  Jan  1999). Another  5 were added in 1999 and were seen in the second  sample capture (04 Nov 1999). The last multi-subject  gateway  was  added  in  2007.  Though  Intute:  all  subjects  and  BUBL:  all  subjects  is  represented  on  the  webpage,  they  were  closed  down  in  2011,  and  the  sites  are  no  longer  updated  as  per  information  at  the  websites  (http://www.intute.ac.uk/  and  http:/ bubl.ac.uk/link  respectively).  Therefore,  7  multi- subject  gateways  exist  currently  (as  marked  with  ‘+’  in  Table  2). 
Thus,  maximum  number  of  subject  and  multi- subject  gateways  were  represented  in  the  1999  captures,  which  covered  the  gateways  set  up  after  1995 as a result of the elib programme. The sudden  activity  in  2005  and  2012  cannot  be  explained,  since  there  is  no  mention  in  literature  of  any  new  programme/project  like  elib  taken  up  to  establish  subject  gateways.  The  originating  institutions  are  diverse and have set up the gateways independently.  For example, out of the new subject gateways started

6.2 year  of formation 
Table 3 shows the distribution of newly formed  subject  gateways  and  multi-subject  gateways  as  found  in  sample  captures  of  years  ranging  from  1999  to  2013.  
36  out  of  the  63  subject  gateways  and  8  out  of  the  14  multi-subject  gateways  were  seen  in  the  captures  taken  in  1999.    They  may  have  been  set  up  earlier,  e.g.,  the  elib  gateways  such  as  BIZED  and SOSIG were set up in early 1996 while ADAM  and  OMNI  were  started  in  199710.

total 63 14 77 
Thus, 44 gateways out of a total 77 (57 %) were  visible in the first capture year. The analysis shows  that 69 out of the 77 gateways (nearly 90 %) have  been  set  up  prior  to  2007,  with  several  gateways  (9) coming up during 2005-2006.  The period during  2008-2011 has been a lean period. Six new subject  gateways  have  been  added  in  2012.  
6.3  Duration  of existence 
An examination of the duration for which gateways  have  persisted  showed  that  14  subject  gateways  have  existed  for  the  longest  period  of  14  years,  till  the  last  capture  available  for  22  Oct  2013  (Table  4  and  Figure  2).  Ten  existed  for  12  years.  The  shortest  period  of  existence  of  approximately  one  year  was  shown  by  9  subject  gateways.  Four  of  the  multi-subject  gateways  have  existed  for  14  years. Three existed for 6 years.  In all, 53 gateways  (nearly  69  %)  persisted  for  more  than  6  years.

6.4    place  of origin 
The  data  shows  that  out  of  63  unique  subject  gateways,  the  majority,  i.e.,  49  originated  in  UK,  7  in  USA,  4  in  Australia,  2  in  Sweden  and  1  in  Finland. Out of the 14 unique multi-subject gateways,  maximum  i.e.  6  originated  in  USA,  4  in  UK,  and  1  each  in  Australia,  Netherlands,  Switzerland  and  Europe  (Table  5).  Thus,  a  maximum  of  53  out  of  total 77 subject and multi-subject gateways (69 %)  originated  in  UK,  the  country  that  had  taken  the  lead  in  creating  this  new  service  through  various  programmes  such  as  eLib  and  RDN.  Most  of  the  new  gateways  created  in  the  past  couple  of  years  have also originated in UK.  Thirteen gateways have  been  set  up  in  USA  and  5  in  Australia.  
6.5 type  of creator/originator 
As  depicted  in  Table  6,  majority  of  the  subject  gateways  (41)  and  multi-subject  gateways  (4)  had  been  set  up  by  universities  or  other  academic  institutions (in all 45 or 58 %). This was followed 6  subject gateways and 3 multi-subject gateways set  up by private/commercial bodies (in all 11 or 14 %).  It  is  seen  that  several  multi-subject  gateways  are

The  investigation  showed  that  out  of  the  63  unique subject gateways, 13 were present at both,  the first and last capture. A 14th  gateway, AERADE  (earlier aerospace resources on the internet), though  not present at the first capture of 17 Jan 1999, was  seen in the 04 Nov 1999 capture. Since it was found  existing  till  the  last  capture,  it  is  included  in  the  list  of  subject  gateways  that  have  survived  for  the  longest  period  (marked  with  ^).  One  multi-subject  gateway  was  found  existing  at  both,  the  first  and  last  capture.  Three  more,  though  not  present  at  the  first  capture,  were  seen  at  the  second  sample  capture.  They  existed  at  the  last  capture,  and  are  hence  included  in  the  list  of  longest  surviving  gateways  (marked  with  ^  in  Table  7).  In  all,  18  gateways were found existing for the longest period  of fourteen years as given in Table 7 (multi-subject  gateways  are  at  serial  numbers  15  to  18).

(ii)  Evaluation  and  Selection  Process 
It  is  noticed  that  only  6  subject/multi-subject  gateways  are  undertaking  actual  evaluation  and  selection of web-based resources by experts before  providing links to them. The gateways are: AERADE,  
was  studied.  The  observations  are  given  below:  (i)    Type  of  Resources 
Online service providing links to numerous other  sites  or  documents  on  the  internet.  The  types  of  resources  that  the  gateways  provide  an  access  to  are  wide  ranging.  They  include  digital  resources  (e-books, journals, articles), databases, glossaries,  directories, simulations, worksheets, spreadsheets,  news,  job  opportunities,  forthcoming  conferences,  discussion lists, bulletin boards, mailing lists, online  library  card  catalogs,  online  degrees,  courses  and  distance  learning  information,  language  lessons  and  schools,  translation  dictionaries  and  services,  software,  best  practices. 
To  know  how  far  the  nature  of  these  longest  
ELDIS, iLoveLanguages, RUDI, SciCentral and Scout  surviving gateways is in tune with the characteristics  
Report Archives. Most of the time the resources are  of  subject  gateways,  the  information  given  under  
reviewed by panels of editors/advisors based on some  ‘purpose’/‘about us’/’mission statement’ at their websites teachers and parents, while www virtual library has  
criteria. The Math Forum has collaborators such as  
374 
expert volunteers doing the job of selecting the links  (there  is  no  mention  of  evaluation  of  resources  in  both  of  these  gateways).  
(iii) Availability  and  Scope 
All  the  gateways  give  the  subject  scope  of  their  collections,  though  not  in  the  form  of  a  formal  scope  policy.    Though  the  gateways  that  engage  experts  for  evaluation  must  be  following  some  selection  policy,  Only  one,  i.e.,  SciCentral  explicitly  lists  out  the  seven  criteria  used,  namely,  (a)  reliability,  (b)  timeliness  of  the  information,  (c)  extent  of  daily  coverage,  (d)  multidisciplinary  coverage,  (e)  leads  to  follow  up  information,  (f)  presentation,  and  (g)  general  appeal.

(iv)  Information About  the  Resources  Covered 
Out  of  the  18  gateways,  only  AERADE  and  ELDIS  provide  abstracts/summaries  of  resources.  (v)  Search  and  Browse Access 
All  the  gateways  provide  structured  access  to  the  resources  indexed  by  them.  They  can  be  browsed  using  directory  or  tags,  or  headings  and  sub-headings.  Most  of  the  gateways  (except  InfoLaw,  Philosophy  Around  The  web,  Psych  web  and  SciCentral)  provide  a  site  search  interface.  Some gateways have also restricted access through  username  and  password.  
(vi)  Collection  Management  Policy 
Since these 18 gateways have been existing for  nearly 14 years (1999 till date), it is clear that they  employ  sound  collection  management  policy  and  carry out maintenance of resource catalogue, links,  etc. SciCentral clearly mentions its methodology: “All  resources will be reviewed monthly and the rankings  adjusted accordingly. we will also continuously assess  new sources for possible inclusion to SciCentral. In  order  for  this  service  to  remain  effective  for  users,  we will limit the number of resources indexed under  any  section  to  a  maximum  of  5.  This  means  that  some sources may disappear from the site as new  ones, deemed more extensive, take their place. This  is  to  ensure  that  SciCentral  users  will  not  have  to  plough  through  dozens  of  links  and  will  always  have  a  quick,  central  access  to  the  ‘best  in  class’  resources  in  any  category”.  
7.   conclUSIonS 
The study has brought out that several subject  gateways were taken up as projects and were shut  down as the project ended. Often, the funding bodies  changed,  leading  to  a  name  change  or  merging  of  gateways  to  form  new  entities  accompanied  by  change in site URL. Sixty three (63) unique subject  gateways  and  14  unique  multi-subject  gateways  were created over the 14 year period between 1999  and 2013, the peak period being between 1999 and  2006  (almost  90  %  gateways  set  up). After  a  lean  period  during  2008-2011,  6  new  subject  gateways  have  been  added  in  2012  and  one  in  2013.    
After the discontinuation of several subject and  multi-subject gateways and addition of new ones over  the years, 34 subject gateways and 7 multi-subject  gateways  exist  currently.  The  shortest  period  of  existence of approximately one year was shown by  9 subject gateways. The longest period of existence  of  14  years  was  exhibited  by  14  subject  gateways  and four multi-subject gateways. In all, 53 gateways  (nearly  69  %)  persisted  for  more  than  6  years. 
Fifty  three  53  (69  %)  out  of  total  77  gateways  originated in the UK with active participation of the  universities,  followed  by  USA  and  Australia  with  13  and  5  gateways  respectively.  Most  of  the  new  gateways created in the past couple of years have  
also originated in the UK, thus showing its continued  dominance.    Majority  of  the  gateways  were  set  up  by  universities/other  academic  institutions  (58  %),  followed  by  private/commercial  bodies  (14  %). 
Juxtaposing  the  characteristics  expected  of  subject  gateways  with  the  observations  made  from  study of the longest surviving gateways, it is found  that  they  adhere  to  some  of  the  characteristics.  However,  the  most  critical  aspect,  i.e.,  evaluation  of  resources  prior  to  selection  that  distinguishes  subject  gateways  from  automated,  search  engine  type  services  is  missing  in  several  of  them  (only  about  33  %  undertake  evaluation).  Though  this  involves  painstaking  and  time  consuming  analysis  by  trained  manpower  with  subject  expertise,  the  value-addition for information seekers is unparalleled  and  worth  the  efforts.
