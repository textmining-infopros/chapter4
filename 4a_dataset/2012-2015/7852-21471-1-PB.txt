This paper gives the results of three measures given to 200 college students who rated  the positivity of titles of articles and books shown either as full bibliographic citation or as title  only. Half of the titles were taken from the university’s academic library’s section on humanities- social sciences, and the other half from the science-technology section. Several ANOVA tests  are reported. Titles from humanities-social sciences were more correctly associated with their  subject headings and were recalled better than titles from the science-technology area. The  results  are  discussed  in  the  context  of  a  theory  of  titles  that  specifes  three  psychological  characteristics of all titles that are present within the linguistic or bibliographic meta-information.  The relationship of these characteristics to general features of human behaviour is specifed  as the affective, cognitive, and sensorimotor properties of titles.

Communication  is  the  transfer  of  ideas.  This  societal  activity  is  facilitated  by  the  tradition  of  documentation,  which  provides  an  orderly  way  of  accomplishing  the  transfer  of  ideas  across  place  and  time.  A  central  approach  in  the  method  of  documentation is the use of titles and headings. The  discourse of communication contains two functional  levels  in  relation  to  documentation  and  to  titles,  namely,  the  ordinary  level  and  the  elevated  level.  The  ordinary  level  of  discourse  is  made  up  of  descriptions and assertions people make in relation  to their observations or opinions. This is what, in a  document,  called  the  body  of  the  text.  In  contrast  to  this  ordinary  text,  there  are  headlines,  titles,  sub-titles, subject headings, descriptors, keywords,  which  make  up  an  ‘elevated’  level  of  discourse.  They  are  made  physically  stand  out  by  making  their size bigger or different by underlining, bolding  italicising or indenting. Headings or titles are actually  comments  about  the  surrounding  text.  
The  title  of  a  book  chapter  says  something  about  what  is  in  the  chapter.  Subject  headings  herald  the  entire  content  of  a  particular  subject  and  collect  them  together  into  a  distinct  bunch  with  a  specific  boundary.  Because  of  their  special  function  in  discourse,  titles  or  headings  are  to  be

considered  as  meta-text  in  relation  to  ordinary  text.  In  consequence,  one  needs  to  examine  in  what  way  the  discourse  of  titles  and  headings  is  different  from  the  rest  of  the  text  in  a  document.  Titles and controlled vocabularies that are used as  subject headings, occupy an important focus in the  information  disciplines  that  are  concerned  with  the  flow of information and its accessibility. This paper  presents  evidence  that  titles  have  psychological  characteristics  in  the  sense  that  titles  influence  the  perceptions,  thoughts,  and  feelings  of  readers,  searchers,  or  users. 
In  a  social  interaction  the  head  of  the  person  occupies  the  chief  place.  To  address  the  person,  one  looks  at  parts  of  the  head.  Similarly,  in  a  document  it  is  the  elevated  discourse  that  it  first  addressed.  To  the  browsing  eye,  headings,  titles,  and sub-titles provide a guide to content and a clue  to conceptual structure. A similar ‘elevated’ function  is  served  by  the  headings  attached  to  tables  and  figures or illustrations and their captions. The same  is  true  of  other  physically  marked  components  such  as  footers  and  page  numbers.  A  document  is  thus  always  made  up  of  text  and  meta-text.  Meta-text in the form of titles or headings plays an  important  role  in  the  retrieval  of  documents  from  library  collections,  online  databases,  and  human  memory.  One  might  suspect  that  just  as  ordinary

text varies in effectiveness or validity, the meta-text  of titles, headings and descriptors may also vary in  efficiency. The creation of a document thus involves  two partially independent systems of communication.  It  is  useful  therefore  to  know  what  characteristics  titles  have  and  to  understand  how  the  properties  of  titles  influence  searches. 
1.1 Cognitive  Characteristics  of  Titles 
According to Maiti & Dutta1   titles  are  generally  assumed  to  be  a  concise  abstract  of  an  article  reflecting its central theme. They argue that words in  assigned keywords or subject headings may poorly  match  those  in  titles.  Jacques  &  Sebire2   present  data  indicating  that  the  construction  of  an  article  title  has  a  significant  impact  on  how  frequently  the paper is cited. Studies have demonstrated that  varying the presence or content of titles can influence  the comprehension, recall or speed of reading and  interpreting text under controlled test conditions3-6.  Titles  have  been  shown  to  aid  in  the  assimilation  of  lecture  content7,  to  reduce  the  ambiguity  of  paragraphs8,  and  to  facilitate  the  organisation  of  text in reading improvement techniques9. Perfetti &  Goldman10  theorise that titles act as ‘recall probes’  and  provide  a  ‘stable  referential  focus’  for  long  term  memory. The  meaning  of  a  task  and  people’s  expectancy  of  success  can  be  manipulated  by  the  choice  of  titles,  which  thus  act  as  ‘attributional  cues’11.  Nahl-Jakobovits  &  Jakobovits12   discovered  that  journal  articles  in  disciplines  that  employ  the  experimental  method,  commonly  express  in  their  titles  the  dependent  and  independent  variables. 
1.2 Affective  Characteristics  of  Titles 
Not only cognitive processes are influenced by  titles, but affective as well. For instance, a dimension  of ‘sensationalism’ of titles was operationally defined  using a specialised Dictionary of Affect13. Stedman and  Alpher14  analysed titles of pop songs into categories  that overlap with the classification and treatment of  emotional illness, and Strahan & Howard15  found that  titles  and  subject  headings  in  psychology  arouse  differential  evaluations  along  affective  dimensions  (important,  trivial,  interesting)  as  well  as  cognitive  (scientific, experimental, behaviouristic). Jakobovits  & Osgood16  examined the attitudes of psychologists  towards  journal  titles  in  their  profession  and  found  distinctive clusters of journals that shared a common  affect  (e.g.,  rigorous  and  specific  vs.  unscientific  and  general). 
1.3  Sensorimotor  Characteristics  of  Titles 
In  a  different  line  of  research,  investigators  have  shown  that  the  wording  and  format  of  titles  of  scientific  documents  can  be  used  to  index  historical  changes  in  the  content  and  complexity  of disciplines17,18. For example, Buxton & Meadows19 
492 
show  that  between  1947  and  1973,  the  length  of  titles of articles in the sciences gradually increases,  more so for chemistry and botany than for the social  sciences  and  philosophy.  The  lengthening  of  titles  was  also  noted  with  psychology  titles  in  France  for  the  period  1900-196920.  The  use  of  the  word  ‘disability’  in  journal  articles  has  been  gradually  declining, reflecting this decade’s new political attitudes  towards  the  handicapped21.  The  use  of  colons  in  titles  or,  ‘titular  colonicity,’  becomes  a  marker  for  Dillon22   to  index  the  progress  of  scholarship  over  a  century,  or  at  least,  its  increasing  conceptual  complexity. 
2. AIM 
To  study  psychological  characteristics  in  the  sense that titles influence the perceptions, thoughts,  and  feelings  of  readers,  searchers,  or  users. 
3.  MeTHodology 
In an attempt to study the psychological characteristics  of titles, three measures were devised to represent  the  three  generally  agreed  upon  psychological  domains  of  behaviour,  namely,  the  affective,  the  cognitive,  and  the  sensorimotor23,24. 
The  ‘affective’  measure  of  titles  consisted  of  people’s ratings of specific titles on bipolar semantic  
differential  scales  chosen  to  reflect  the  concept  of  ‘positivity.’  The  following  is  an  illustration  by25: 
The  person  is  instructed  to  ‘rate  the  title  of  this  article’  by  placing  a  check  mark  on  one  of  the  seven  positions  on  each  scale  provided.  In  the  analysis  of  the  data,  each  rating  is  assigned  a  score  of  1  (extremely  positive)  to  7  (extremely  negative),  with  4  defining  the  mid-point  as  equally  positive  and  negative.  An  average  Positivity  score  is  calculated  for  each  title  over  all  the  raters  and  scales (three in the present case). If a title receives  a  low  average  score  (around  1  or  2),  then  it  is  viewed very positively by subjects. If a title obtains  an  average  score  of  around  6  or  7,  then  that  title  is  perceived  as  very  negative.  Each  pair  of  experimenters  chose  their  own  three  scales  to  represent  the  concept  of  “positivity.”  
Two hundred respondents were male and female  college  students  in  their  early  twenties  enrolled  in  the  Psychology  Major  program  for  undergraduates  in  their  Sophomore  year  (age  range  21-24). 
A  ‘cognitive’  measure  for  titles  was  devised  by  having  raters  identify  the  correct  subject  heading  for  a  specific  title.  All  titles  were  chosen  from  periodical indexes so that each title’s listed subject  heading  was  also  noted.  The  raters  were  given  

========2========

JAMES: MEASuRING  P SyCHOLOGICAL  C HARACTERISTICS OF  T ITLES OF  J OuRNAL  A RTICLES AND THEIR  Su BJECT  H EADINGS 
several  subject  headings  below  each  title  and  were instructed to ‘choose the subject heading that  best  goes  with  this  title.’  Only  one  of  the  subject  headings  listed  was  the  correct  one  as  obtained  from  the  periodical  index.  The  alternatives  were  either  different  subject  headings  from  the  same  periodicals  or  fabricated  ones.  A  score  of  1  was  given for every correct choice and an overall score  was given by summing over all attempts (six in the  present  case).  This  cognitive  measure  was  called  ‘ease of subject heading identification.’ By averaging  the data over all raters, each title received a score.  The  higher  the  score  for  any  title,  the  easier  it  is  for  subjects  to  identify  the  correct  subject  heading  for  that  title. 
As  a  measure  of  the  ‘sensorimotor’  aspect  of  titles,  raters  were  instructed  to  write  down  from  memory  the  titles  they  were  shown  when  rating  them for positivity, and when trying to identify their  correct  subject  headings.  The  ratings  of  the  three  titles  on  the  three  scales  and  the  subject  heading  identification  task  together  took  between  one  and  two  minutes.  Thus  no  time  was  given  to  study  or  rehearse. A score of 1 was given for every correctly  reproduced  title  word.  Each  title  thus  received  an  ease  of  reproduction  score.  The  higher  this  score  for  any  title,  the  easier  it  is  to  reproduce  from  memory  under  these  test  conditions. 
3.1   d ata  Collection  Procedures 
The data were collected by the college students  participating  in  a  group  data  collection  exercise  in  an  undergraduate  course  in  statistics.  Students  worked in pairs, jointly choosing periodical indexes  at  the  university  library,  selecting  titles,  recording  their subject headings, and preparing a test booklet  containing three titles and instructions for obtaining  the  three  dependent  measures  described  above.  
There  were  two  independent  manipulations  in  the  booklets  distributed  to  the  raters:  Context  and  Disciplines. The ‘Context’ factor had two levels: Full  and Partial. In the Full Context condition each of the  six  titles  appeared  within  a  full  citation  (as  in  the  illustration  above).  In  the  Partial  Context  condition  only  the  title  itself  showed.  Otherwise  the  two  types  of  booklets  varying  the  Context  factor  were  identical  and  consisted  of  printed  pages  stapled  together. When the booklets were distributed to the  raters,  half  of  them  at  random  received  booklets  with  titles  in  Full  Context  (complete  citation)  while  the  other  half  of  the  raters  received  booklets  with  Partial  Context  (titles  only).  In  this  way,  random  assignment of raters to the independent conditions  was  insured. 
The second independent variable, ‘Disciplines’,  also  had  two  levels:  HuM-SOC  and  SCI-TECH.  In  half of the booklets the titles had been chosen from  
the  university  library  containing  periodical  indexes  in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HuM-SOC).  The  other  half  of  the  booklets  contained  titles  chosen from the reference area for the Science and  Technology  periodical  indexes  (SCI-TECH).  
The design of the study is thus a 2x2 independent  measures analysis of variance with four subgroups  of  50  subjects  each.  The  four  conditions  were  represented  by  the  four  types  of  booklets:  Full  Context  for  HuM-SOC  disciplines  (subgroup  1),  Partial Context for HuM-SOC disciplines (subgroup  2), Full Context for SCI-TECH disciplines (subgroup  3),  and  Partial  Context  for  SCI-TECH  disciplines  (subgroup  4).  The  four  types  of  booklets  were  randomly  assigned  in  each  of  the  test  groups  by  all  pairs  of  experimenters.  Each  booklet  contained  three  titles  (either  from  HuM-SOC  or  SCI-TECH)  and  appeared  either  in  Full  Context  or  in  Partial  Context.  
Each  title  was  rated  on  three  dependent  measures:  positivity  (affective  measure),  ease  of  subject  heading  identification  (cognitive  measure),  and  ease  of  reproduction  (sensorimotor  measure).  Each  pair  of  experimenters  worked  independently  and chose their own six titles and subject headings.  Each  pair  tested  5  raters  in  each  of  the  four  cells  (conditions).  Thus  the  data  includes  200  people  and  60  titles. 
4.   r eSulTS And  AnAlySIS 
Personal  experience  lead  to  the  expectation  that  in  terms  of  the  affective  measure  SCI-TECH  titles  might  receive  less  positive  ratings  because  of their more technical nature. For a similar reason  one might expect lower scores for SCI-TECH titles  with  the  cognitive  measure  of  ease  of  subject  heading identification. Further, it was reasoned that  a  full  context  would  yield  better  scores  for  ease  of  subject heading identification than a partial context,  since the additional citation information could serve  people  to  make  a  matching  decision.  In  terms  of  the  sensorimotor  measure  of  title  reproducibility,  prior  literature  from  the  field  of  verbal  learning  would  predict  that  partial  context  should  produce  higher  reproduction  scores  since  there  was  less  information  to  decode26.  In  other  words,  the  extra  citation  information  of  author,  journal,  volume  and  date  may  act  to  diffuse  attention  or  may  produce  an  interference  effect,  thus  reducing  the  score27.  
4.1 Positivity  of  Titles 
For the affective score of ‘Positivity’ of titles, the  means  for  all  subgroups  and  titles  combined  were  close  to  4,  the  neutral  position.  The  independent  measures  ANOVA  yielded  an  insignificant  effect  for  ‘Context’  (F  (1,196)=1.12),  not  significant.  In  other  words  the  titles  were  rated  about  neutral  on  
493 

========3========

DJLIT,  VOL.  34,  NO.  6,  NOVEMBER   2014 
positivity   (rating:  4.00)  under  both-conditions  full  context  (rating:  3.84)  and  partial  context  (rating:  3.97).  
For the factor of ‘Disciplines’, the ANOVA yielded  a significant effect (F (1,196)=4.80, p<01). In other  words, the titles selected from the HuM-SOC periodical  indexes were rated more positively (Mean=2.14, i.e.,  very positive) than the titles selected from the SCI- TECH periodicals (Mean=4.06, i.e., neutral or slightly  negative). Inspection of distribution histograms (not  presented here) shows the following general trend:  the  modal  score  is  3  (slightly  positive)  and  only  a  few  titles  are  ever  perceived  extremely  (either  positive  or  negative).  This  apparent  hesitance  in  rating  titles  other  than  slightly  positive  or  slightly  negative  is  reflected  by  the  very  small  standard  error  that  ranged  from  .08  to  0.13  of  a  scale  unit.  The  small  error  variance  indicates  that  very  few  raters  departed  from  this  trend. 
4.2   e ase  of  Subject  Heading  Identification 
For  the  cognitive  measure  of  ease  of  subject  heading  identification,  the  ANOVA  disclosed  a  significant  effect  for  ‘Disciplines’  (F  (1,196)=4.68,  p<.05)  and  a  non-significant  effect  for  ‘Context’  (F  (1,196)=1.87).  In  other  words,  the  titles  selected  from  the  HuM-SOC  periodical  indexes  were  more  easily  matched  to  their  correct  subject  headings  (Mean=2.14  correct  out  of  three  attempts)  than  the titles for the SCI-TECH periodicals (Mean=1.76  correct  matching).  Since  the  maximum  score  was  3,  it  follows  that  people  were  able  to  match  the  correct  subject  heading  for  71  %  of  the  HuM-SOC  titles but only 59 % of the SCI-TECH titles. Though  the  context  effect  on  matching  titles  with  subject  headings  did  not  reach  significance,  the   direction  of  the  effects  shown  in  Table  1  make  sense  (2.14  vs.  1.76).  Presenting  the  full  citation  yields  higher  
matching  scores  for  both  types  of  disciplines  as  shown by the rows on Interaction Effects. However,  since  the  trend  is  not  significant,  the  situation  is  ambiguous. Perhaps more than three titles of each  type are needed to reliably establish this difference.  Further  theoretical  developments  are  needed  to  identify  the  cognitive  operations  people  use  to  match titles with their appropriate subject headings.  One  possibility  might  be  that  the  reader  expands  a  title  and  its  descriptor  into  a  paraphrase;  if  the  two  paraphrases  match  in  meaning  then  they  are  seen  as  associated28. 
4.3   e ase  of  Title recall  or reproduction 
Finally, with respect to the sensorimotor measure  of  title  reproduction, Table  1  shows  that  the  partial  context  yields  a  significantly  higher  rate  of  correct  reproduction  (Mean  =  15.56  words)  than  the  full  context  (Mean  =  11.92  words).  The  F  (1,196)  for  the  Context  factor  is  13.94,  p<0.001).  In  other  words,  for  the  partial  context  where  only  the  titles  are  seen,  the  raters  can  reproduce  about  10  %  more  words  than  under  the  full  context  where  the  titles  have  to  be  isolated  and  discriminated  from  the  additional  citation  information.  This  finding  needs to be replicated under a more specific set of  conditions  that  attempt  to  control  the  length  of  the  titles  and  the  amount  of  time  raters  are  exposed  to  them.  The  fact  that  the  partial  context  yields  better  recall  than  the  full  context  can  be  attributed  to  the  interference  effect  of  the  embedded  citation  information29.  
In  terms  of  the  effect  of  Disciplines  upon  title  recall,  the  HuM-SOC  titles  were  slightly  easier  to  reproduce  (Mean  =  14.17  vs.  13.31  words),  but  this  trend  was  not  significant  (F  (1,196)=0.78).  It  may  be  that  more  titles  need  to  be  used  to  test  this  difference  adequately.

Summarising  the  significant  findings,  It  can  be  said that with regards to the manipulation of HuM- SOC  vs.  SCI-TECH  periodicals,  titles  from  more  technical disciplines evoked from non-professionals  less  positive  feelings  and  were  more  difficult  to  match with assigned subject headings. With regards  to  the  Partial  vs.  Full  Context  manipulation,  titles  in  a  Full-Citation  Context  were  less  well  recalled  under artificial conditions of testing (i.e., reproducing  three unfamiliar titles after looking at them for about  one  minute).  
It  is  clear  from  these  and  other  results  as  summarised  in  the  introduction,  that  titles  possess  psychological  characteristics  that  can  functionally  be  classified  within  the  three  domains  of  human  behaviour—affective, cognitive, and sensorimotor        
30,31.  Figure 1 is an attempt to specify further the definition  of these three domains of user behaviour in relation  to  titles  and  subject  headings. 
4.4 Comprehending  and  Producing  a  Title 
The  ‘affective’  characteristic  of  a  title  reflects  its  intended  audience  and  purpose  (‘Who  is  it  for?  and  Why  should  it  be  read?’).  When  reading  a  title  we  canreconstruct  the  affective  information  in  the  title  if  we  know  the  general  purpose  of  the  document,  how  it  relates  to  other  documents  (or  its ‘context’), and the authoritativeness of the work  (‘validity’).  This  information  is  contained  in  the  title’s  presuppositions  or  assumptions,  that  is,  the  information  it  takes  for  granted  and  supposes  the  audience  to  already  possess.  Thus,  the  affect  of  a  title  lies  in  its  presuppositions.  As  indicated  in  Fig. 1, the affective domain is the last of the three

steps in the analytic or interpretation sequence (from  right to left). Thus, one might be able to reproduce  or  even  paraphrase  a  title  (sensorimotor  domain)  without understanding its meaning or deeper message  (cognitive domain). As well, one might comprehend  a title and its implications (cognitive domain) without  appreciating  its  importance  or  relevance  (affective  domain).  There  is  thus  a  developmental  evolution  (from  right  to  left)  in  the  comprehension  of  a  title,  from its external form (sensorimotor domain), through  its  intellectual  content  (cognitive  domain),  to  its  essence,  that  is,  its  purpose  and  validity  (affective  domain). 
The  ‘cognitive’  information  of  a  title  involves  its aboutness and accuracy (‘What is it about? and  ‘Is  it  true?’).  While  the  affective  domain  pertains  to  human  will  and  character,  the  cognitive  is  its  intellectual embodiment in the mental form of human  understanding32. The semantic dimension of good and  bad  pertain  to  the  domain  of  the  affective  domain,  while the cognitive domain has degrees of true vs.  false  or  accurate  vs.  erroneous. The  meaning  of  a  title includes the cognitive implications that lie in the  title’s deep structure33. Comprehending a title involves  being  able  to  draw  cognitive  implications  about  it,  such  as  the  ability  to  specify  the  educational  or  intellectual level of the text, and some knowledge of  the  subject  it  may  cover  in  its  Table  of  Contents.  
The  sensorimotor  information  of  a  title  reside  in  its  literal  form  (‘How  is  it  expressed?’).  
The encoding act of creating a title is a generative  or  synthetic  process  (left  to  right  in  Fig.  1)  that  begins  with  the  creator’s  intention  and  purpose  (Who will it be for?), which belongs to the affective  domain.  The  process  continues  with  the  cognitive  characteristics (What is it to be about?), and ends with  the sensorimotor presentation (How is it specifically  to  be  expressed?).  
Conversely, perusing a title is an analytic process  of decoding from the sensorimotor information (How  is it expressed?”), through the cognitive information  (What is it about?), to the affective information (Why  is it important?). Since a title functions as the head  of  a  body  of  text,  it  corresponds  to  the  threefold  aspect  of  human  affairs:  purpose  or  motive  from  the  will  (affective  domain),  content  and  structure  from  the  understanding  (cognitive  domain),  and  expression  in  use  (sensorimotor  domain)34. 
4.5   n eeded—The  Theory  of  Titles 
Given  that  titles  are  culturally  complex  objects  and exert significant influence in the flow and control  of information, there is a need for a theory of titles.  It  ought  to  be  sufficiently  complex  to  integrate  the  psychological characteristics of titles with the principles  of information flow and information control. One use  of  the  theory  of  titles  would  be  to  account  for  the

elements  outlined  in  Fig.  2,  which  lists  the  steps  leading  up  to  the  creation  of  a  title  by  an  author,  followed  by  the  steps  leading  to  its  interpretation. by readers, and includes the role of the information  specialist.  The  author’s  production  of  primary  text  and titles is a synthetic encoding process whereby  the  author’s  affective  state  (purpose,  intention)  produces cognitive sequences (context, aboutness)  that  are  ultimately  transformed  into  sensorimotor  acts (expressions in words). This is shown in steps  1  through  4  in  Fig.  2: 
Producing  a  title  is  an  inductive  process  while  interpreting or using a title to make search decisions  is  an  analytic  or  deductive  process  as  depicted  in  steps  5  through  8  in  Fig.  2.  The  use  of  titles  by  information  specialists  (steps  4-5-6)  is  to  be  distinguished  from  their  use  by  library  patrons  or  information seekers (steps 4-6-7-8). Cataloguers and  indexers  use  titles  when  they  make  classification  decisions  by  adhering  to  classification  schemes  with  agreed  upon  notation  rules  as  embodied  in  subject  authority  lists  and  other  controlled  index  vocabularies peculiar to specific disciplines. Subject  headings  and  descriptors  or  keywords  used  in  the  preparation  of  indexes  can  be  viewed  as  elevated  text fragments and their paraphrases or synonyms.  In  the  creation  of  an  alphabetic  subject  index,  a  certain type of semantic familiarity with a discipline  is  required  in  order  to  know  which  fragments  or  key  phrases  of  the  text  of  a  document  can  be  appropriately  elevated  to  the  status  of  an  entry  in  a  coordinate  index35.  In  a  keyword-in-context  index  title  fragments  are  taken  as  entries.  Search  commands are actually concatenated title fragments  separated  by  Boolean  operators. 
The meaning or interpretation of a title is called  an  annotation  in  Fig.  2  (step  6).  Annotations  are  comments  we  make  to  ourselves  (or  out  loud  to  others)  about  a  title  and  are  influenced  by  
Figure 2. Flow of information in bibliographic communication.

our  momentary  purpose  or  motive  (affective)  for  reading  (sensorimotor)  and  attending  to  the  title  (cognitive).  These  annotations  and  reactions  to  a  title influence our cognitive processes and affective  states.  Acquiring  knowledge  and  changing  our  attitudes  as  readers  and  consumers  of  information  can  thus  be  viewed  in  terms  of  consequences  of  a  chain  of  events  that  began  with  the  experiences  and  ideas  of  the  author.  
Titles  are  thus  vehicles  for  communication  viewed  as  an  exchange  of  affective,  cognitive  and  sensorimotor  acts  between  author  and  reader.  Information specialists adjoin themselves to this flow  through  the  classification  of  titles  into  information  systems that help readers find titles through controlled  vocabularies hierarchically arranged and interlinked  through  cross-references.

The theory of titles will grow with the integration  of research on titles in several disciplines that include  library and information science, psychology, linguistics,  English,  and  sociology.  Information  specialists  can  investigate the relation between the characteristics of  titles and their ease of retrievability36. What aspects  of titles cause them to be recognised as potentially  relevant to a searcher? How can one instruct users  to  extract  search  relevant  information  from  titles?  Psychologists  can  focus  on  the  titling  act  itself:  How  does  personality  affect  the  interpretation  of  titles?  How  do  readers  organize  their  ideas  about  a  title?  What  characteristics  of  titles  aid  in  their  recognition  and  recall?  
Linguists have analytic tools to map the structure  of phrases and sentences37. These  techniques  can  relate  the  surface  structure  or  appearance  of  a  title to its deeper structure which conveys meaning  and  allows  for  the  derivation  of  implications  and  presuppositions.  Some  titles  have  a  more  difficult  structure than others: Does the structural complexity  influence the title’s ability to be paraphrased? How do  titles cluster semantically? Do titles and their subject  headings cluster similarly? Can one demonstrate deep  structure relations between titles and their text? Are  there levels of titles? Coates38   argues  for  levels  of  syntax  in  indexing  languages  and  relates  them  to  classification. A similar analysis is needed for titles  and headings generally. Researchers in English and  education  can  explore  the  personal  factors  that  lead  to  the  production  of  successful  versus  less  successful  titles  as  well  as  their  acceptance  by  readers. They can also describe in greater detail the  intuitions  that  allow  experienced  writers  to  convey meaning,  genre  and  style  through  titles. 
The problem of improving writing skills is related  to the study of titles in a direct way since outlining,

is  an  essential  activity  in  much  of  writing  and  is  accomplished  through  the  use  of  shorthand  phrases  that  act  as  titles  and  sub-titles  arranged  in  a  meaningful  sequence.  Sociologists  have  an  interest  in  titles  as  value  objects  at  the  societal  and  institutional  levels.  As  was  mentioned  in  the  introduction,  historical  trends  in  the  evolution  of  disciplines  and  topics  have  formed  the  focus  of  some investigations. Sociological inquiries may also  focus on the social politics of naming new products  and services. Names behave like titles and can be  considered  as  equivalent  in  function.  
Sub-cultural  differences  and  class  distinctions  are  accompanied  by  distinguishing  markers  that  include  verbal  style  and  preferences  for  titles  of  songs, events, situations, and activities. One would  expect  from  the  sociological  and  sociolinguistic  perspectives that ethnic background would influence  the communication value and retrievability of titles.  As a political remedy to this problem it is conceivable  that  in  the  future,  documents  and  reference  works  may  be  known  by  different  titles  depending  on  the  social  or  cultural  setting.  This  would  insure  that  titles  are  aids  to  the  searcher,  not  sub-cultural  barriers.  
The  theory  of  titles  will  be  established  through  the  integration  of  the  entire  complex  of  issues  as  understood  in  these  disciplines.
