ABSTRACT
This paper provides a comparison between the American and Indian digital preservation programmes
based on the essential building blocks such as national legislation for digital preservation, basic legal framework,
national digital preservation initiative, digital preservation tools, standards and practice guidelines, digital
repository infrastructure, and audit and certification. Selected digital preservation policies of the organisations
from UK, USA, Canada, and Australia are also analysed. The gap analysis shows that in the Indian context,
legislation on digital preservation of electronic records and institutional digital preservation policies are the
missing elements, which need to be addressed on high priority. The preservation policy is a mandatory
requirement for the audit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories.
Keywords: Digital preservation policy, trustworthy digital repository

1. INTRODUCTION
The objective of this paper is to identify gaps and
differences in the Indian versus International digital
preservation programmes, particularly the US initiative, so
as to enable the Indian government in taking necessary
steps towards bridging the gaps and strengthening its
own National Digital Preservation Programme (NDPP).
Selected institutional digital preservation policies are also
studied to derive guidance on the coverage, structure and
focus of the policies.
The legislation can drive the digital preservation
initiatives at national level and the institutional policies
can drive the digital preservation activities at the
organisation level.

2. BACKGROUND
The National Study Report on Digital Preservation
Requirements of India1 of Department of Electronics and
Information Technology (DeitY), Government of India,
indicates the enlarging volumes of born digital information
through the 27 mission-mode projects of National eGovernance Action Plan (NeGP) and digitalisation
initiatives of other government departments in India. The
report also highlights the unpreparedness of the record
producing organisations and the potential threats to this
Received 27 June 2012, online published 18 July 2012

digital information due to digital obsolescence. Therefore,
the DeitY promptly took the initiative to formulate the
NDPP for India. As per the recommendations in the
National Study Report, DeitY has sponsored to establish
the Centre of Excellence for Digital Preservation at C-DAC
Pune, with a mandate to develop the pilot digital
repositories for e-District Mission Mode Project of NeGP,
National Archives of India, and Indira Gandhi National
Centre for Arts. In this project, C-DAC is also developing
various tools, standards and best practices for digital
preservation.

3. COMPARISON OF DIGITAL PRESERVATION
PROGRAMMES
3.1 Parallel Initiatives
Figure 1 shows the comparison based on the building
blocks (middle column) of digital preservation
programmes launched by USA and India. Though there
may be differences in volume, scope, budget, and
execution strategies, it is possible to draw the parallels
between similar initiatives taken by both USA and India
such as availability of basic legal framework, national
digital preservation initiative, efforts on evolving standards
and practice guidelines, development of digital
preservation tools and digital repositories.

Figure 1. Comparison between American and Indian digital preservation programmes.

3.2 Gaps in the Building Blocks
As per Fig. 1, the most notable difference or the gap
between American and Indian digital preservation
programmes is at its origin and the main driving force. In
case of US, the National Digital Information Infrastructure
and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) came into being after
the US Congress passed NDIIPP legislation in December
20002. The legislation empowered the Library of Congress
as the lead coordinating agency to implement the
program by involving the key government agencies,
namely, the Department of Commerce, the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the National
Archives and Records Administration—and with those
entities with expertise in the collection and maintenance
of archives of digital materials—the National Library of
Medicine, the National Agricultural Library, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, the Research
Libraries Group, the OCLC Online Computer Library
Center, and the Council on Library and Information
Resources—as well as with the wide group of private
sector institutions working in digital formats. The
Presidential Memorandum on Managing Government
Records3 by Barack Obama issued on November 28, 2011
is accessible from the website of the White House. It
322

specifies the commitments to record management
reforms and the record management directives with clear
time limits and deadlines. The congressional legislation
on preservation of digital information being produced
across a wide spectrum of domains is evidently the main
driving force behind the unambiguous commitment
towards digital preservation.
On the India side, the draft Electronic Service Delivery
Bill4 is ready and due to be passed by the Indian
parliament, which makes it mandatory for all government
agencies to offer citizen services through electronic
means within next 5 years but it is silent on the digital
preservation of electronic records. The legal justification
for digital preservation in India largely rests upon the
retention requirements or indirect/derived triggers for
preservation as per the provisions in Information
Technology Act, Right To Information Act, Copyright Act
and the Public Records Act. Most of these laws need to
be upgraded and harmonised for addressing the digital
preservation requirements of electronic records. The
Centre of Excellence for Digital Preservation has ensured
the participation of some of the key stakeholders like
National Informatics Centre, National Archives of India,
Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts, STQC, NeGP, etc.,
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(4)

but is currently limited by the project duration. The active
participation from Department of Culture, Department of
Commerce and other ministries is equally important.

3.3 Need of Legislation on Digital
Preservation of Electronic Records and
Digital Information
Therefore, in the Indian context, the legal justification
for digital preservation is inadequate to generate a
national level momentum and a landslide change in the
policies. The present initiatives can build the
competencies, tools and standards necessary for
developing the digital repositories but it may not be
sufficient to spread the digital preservation movement
across all ministries and departments at central and state
level. Therefore, the Indian government must formulate
and pass the legislation on digital preservation of
electronic records and digital information on priority. The
proposed legislation on digital preservation of electronic
records and digital information and rigorous follow up
action will help in propagating the digital preservation.

3.4 Need of Institutional Digital Preservation
Policies
The institutional digital preservation policy framework
is the next logical consequence of the national legislation.
Such policy framework is meant to provide the required
mandate, decisions, financial support and commitment
from the authorities for the digital preservation of
information produced by the institution. Numerous
institutional digital preservation policy documents
published by various university libraries, archives, and
repositories are easily accessible from their respective
websites. The digital preservation policies of selected
institutions from UK, Canada, USA, and Australia have
been analysed and presented in Table 1. The analysis of
digital preservation policies identifies the following
aspects:

•

Key constituents of digital preservation policy

A comprehensive list of key constituents is prepared
by integrating the points from various digital preservation
policies.

•

Generic statements

The presence of very generic statements in the policy
are marked as (generic).

•

Basic definitions

The presence of basic definitions related to digital
preservation in the policy. Presence of such definitions is
marked as (basic).

•

Specific clauses
The presence of specific clauses which define the

DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(4)

direction, conditions and decisions are marked as
(specific). It is observed that most of the digital
preservation policies are filled with basic definitions and
write-ups which explain the key concepts of digital
preservation. Actually, the policy is not expected to
explain the technical concepts or educate the readers
about digital preservation. If necessary, it can be done
separately. The institutional policies are expected to
convey the direction, decisions, conditions, expected
actions, commitment, availability of support, and
ownership. Such framework of policies has to provide
adequate coverage for such activities related to digital
preservation, which require to be guided and supported by
the policy framework for consistency and clarity of
operations. The unique characteristics of the selected
policies are briefly discussed hereafter.

3.5 Digital Preservation Policy of Selected
Institutions
3.5.1

Parliamentary Archives, UK

Digital preservation policy of Parliamentary Archives,
UK5 is comprehensive but sometimes it indulges in
providing definitions of various technical aspects, like,
authenticity, integrity, significant properties, bitstream
preservation, reliability, usability, migration, audit, etc.
The definitions are anyway part of the glossary of terms
so the policy framework could focus purely on clauses.
The most notable part in this policy is that it has been
agreed by a working group of the two Houses’ Information
Services and Parliamentary ICT in March 2008 and
subsequently endorsed by both Management Boards.
The interesting aspect of this policy is that it is directly
linked with the knowledge management (KM) and
information technology (IT) strategies. It also specifically
mentions that the parliament may use the services of
external contractors or partners or other nominated thirdparty in the section on custody and hosting.

3.5.2

Library and Archives of Canada (LAC)

The digital preservation policy of Library and Archives
of Canada (LAC)6 is simple, clear and offers the best
combination of technical and administrative clauses. This
policy clearly specifies that their primary objective is to
become the Trusted Digital Repository. In the section on
challenges, the limitations of digital preservation due to
unavailability of established standards and ambiguity
related to digital rights are clearly stated. The section on
Principles and Commitments mentions that LAC ensures
a financial commitment to acquisition, description,
accessibility, and preservation programme for digital
materials. The commitment to review and audit of the
LAC’s Trusted Digital Repository Services on a regular
basis is also mentioned. Standards and quality control
section
specifically
mentions
the
technical
specifications, accepted file formats, metadata

not mix clauses with definitions.

3.5.3 H-Net Electronic Mailing List
The digital preservation policy of H-Net electronic
mailing list, Michigan State University7 is also one of the
best policy frameworks available. H-Net is committed to
long-term preservation of discussion logs, academic
discourses through more than 180 academic networks
and public electronic mailing lists. The e-mail list
conformance to OAIS section of their policy provides
technical specifications of the submission information
324

package (SIP), archival information package (AIP) and
delivery information package (DIP). The technological and
procedural suitability section provides technical policies
for message ingest, storage, and retrieval. H-Net also
expresses its commitment to audit and certification
process and aims at becoming a trustworthy digital
repository.

3.5.4 National Library of Australia
The policy of National Library of Australia8 provides a
broad approach to digital preservation. The ownership of
the policy is entrusted with the Director of the National
DESIDOC J. Lib. Inf. Technol., 2012, 32(4)

Library’s Web Archiving and Digital Preservation Branch.
The policies become abstract or concrete depending on
the focus, e.g., H-Net’s preservation policy is extremely
focused if compared with the policy of National Library of
Australia or the Parliamentary Archive of UK. Several
guidelines are already available to help in formulating the
preservation policy9,10, but it is believed that study of
actual preservation policies can give more clarity.

Figure 2 shows that the ecosystem of trustworthy
digital repositories12 include national legislation, basic
legal framework, policy and the all support systems such
as administration, manpower, standards and tools. All
libraries, archives and repositories converge13 in terms of
the need of such ecosystem.

The Indian record producing institutions are yet to
define their policies for digital preservation of born digital
or electronic records. The proposed legislation on digital
preservation is a tedious and long process. In that case, it
will be most appropriate if NeGP prepared its own digital
preservation policy framework for the preservation of
electronic records produced through its 27 mission-mode
Projects. Similarly, the National Archives of India, Indira
Gandhi National Centre for Arts and Delhi Court must
define their own digital preservation policies and get them
authorised from the respective parent ministries.

Based on the comparison of digital preservation
programmes between US and India, it is observed that the
Indian government needs to formulate the legislation on
preservation of electronic records and digital information
on high priority. The institutional digital preservation policy
is a result of the mandate, objectives and legal obligations
of the organisation. The Indian archival institutions and
record producers need to formulate their digital
preservation policies to fulfill the primary need specified in
the ISO for audit and certification of trustworthy digital
repositories11.

4. AUDIT AND CERTIFICATION OF
TRUSTWORTHY DIGITAL REPOSITORIES
As per the ISO 16363:2012 on Audit and Certification
of Trustworthy Digital Repositories11, the preservation
policy is a written statement, authorised by the repository
management, that describes the approach to be taken by
the repository for the preservation of objects accessioned
into the repository. It also specifies the need of procedural
accountability and preservation policy framework. In the
Indian scenario, the technical requirements of the
Trustworthy Digital Repository are being addressed.
