Social networking services have become a very powerful tool to provide library services. Over a period of time  libraries are using online social networking services to make their services popular and user friendly. Social networking  services like facebook, youtube, twitter, linkedin, google+, instagram have many applications that could be utilised  by the libraries to provide number of services in libraries. The paper reports the use of social networking services  in University libraries, based on a study of 54 university websites in Karnataka state. Method of content analysis  has been adopted to study the websites. The results indicate that 53 of 54 universities (98.14%) do have their own  websites in different domains. 29.62% State/Central universities are connected to Facebook. 18.51% are connected  to Youtube. Very few are connected to Twitter and Linkedin.18.51% of  Universities are connected to different  networking sites. It is observed that the universities libraries in the state are catching up with these technologies but  many of these services are used for mere elementary purposes. The study concludes that it is time for the university  libraries to exploit the services and use the optimum potentialities of these Social networking services.

1. INtrOdUctION 
Social networking service has emerged as a powerful  form for providing library services. Because of the very  nature  of  online  social  networking  services,  academic  libraries  can  adopt  these  tools  in  many  ways  to  provide  innovative  services.  Social  networking  services  like  facebook, youtube, twitter, linkedin, google+, instagram  have  many  applications  that  could  be  utilised  by  the  libraries  to  provide  number  of  services1.  These  may  be  used  to  reach  a  new  audience  of  potential  users  and  provide  quick  updates  to  users  and  build  discussion  groups  and  collaborative  work. These  may  also  be  used  to market specific programs, products and services, push  library  news  and  press  release,  modernise  the  library  image  and  reputation.  These  can  be  used  for  outreach  activities  through  onward  sharing,  well  beyond  the  institution itself, helping build connections and reputation  more  broadly. 
Uses of social networking services include developing  library resources, connecting staff with users, searching  library catalogues and other online resources, providing  user  education,  creating  awareness  of  library  resources,  connecting with other librarians and library staff, getting  feedback  on  library  and  its’  services,  etc.  Online  social  networking service enables the academic library to pursue  its  mission  and  goals  online,  while  promoting  library  resources  and  services.  
Many studies have been reported on the use of online  social  networking  services  in  the  academic  libraries

environment.  Clyde2   reported  that  during  1990’s  public  and academic libraries used blogs and during 2000’s the  situation varies as significant difference is observed from  country to country. O‘Reilly3  observed that social media  is a continually updated service, that gets better as many  people use it. Dinesh & Nikam4  have observed that social  networks  are  used  to  promote  library  services  to  match  with user’s opportunities. Malhan & Shivarama5  suggest  the libraries to identify a role in the larger awareness of  sharing  best  practices  in  any  given  area.  The  review  of  related literature finds that few libraries are using social  networking tools to develop communities and personalise  interactions between the library and users6,7. Tools  such  as Facebook and Twitter were used to build relationships  and  rapport  with  client  groups8,9. 
Study  of  20  academic  libraries  revealed  that  users  appear  to  reject  connecting  with  libraries  on  Facebook,  even though other libraries are potentially using Facebook  to  forge  good  relationships  with  users10.  Louden  and  Hall11   found  that  some  LIS  staff  find  it  difficult  to  integrate  Twitter  into  library  work.  Barriers  relating  to  privacy  and  IT  issues  were  also  identified  in  the  library sector literature. A study on the use of Facebook  in  libraries  identified  issues  with  users  who  were  not  wishing  to  be  friends  of  libraries  on  Facebook  in  their  social  spaces12.  
Hence  the  present  study  has  been  undertaken  to  identify  the  usage  of  social  networking  services  in  the  University  libraries  of  Karnataka.

2. MethOdOLOgy 
Social  networking  sites  have  real  potential  use  for  delivering  library  services.  In  this  regard,  in  this  paper  it  is  examined  how  these  social  networking  services  have  been  used  by  university  libraries  of  Karnataka  State. Karnataka has 54 universities including 1 Central  university, 26 State Universities, 12 Private and 15 Deemed  universities. The webpages of individual universities and  libraries  have  been  visited  to  assess  to  what  extent  the  social networking services are used by university libraries.  The  data  has  been  tabulated,  for  analysis.

3.1.1. Facebook 
Facebook members can share photos, send and receive  messages, chat, tag themselves or others in photos, write  on  friend’s  walls,  join  groups,  create  new  groups,  share  new  ideas  in  group  discussions,  add  applications  and  play  games13.  From  Table  1  it  is  found  that  libraries  of  8  of  the  27  (29.62%)  State/Central  universities  are  connected  to  Facebook,  while  libraries  websites  of  2  universities  show  connections  towards  Facebook  but  no  further  links  are  found.  Out  of  8  universities  libraries  it  is  found  that  the  optimum  usage  of  Facebook  is  not  made,  as  only  few  notifications,  photos,  posts,  videos regarding university functions are uploaded. Only  Mangalore  University,  Mangalore  and  Visveswaraya  Technological University, Belagavi have provided linkages  to  the  library  web  pages  through  Facebook,  and  further  through  the  Facebook  account  the  user  can  access  the  library  services  like  WebOPAC,  e-resources,  remote access  facility,  etc.  
9  Private  University  libraries  (75%)  are  linked  to  Facebook  through  their  websites,  while  one  University  library has connection to Facebook but no further linkages  are found. Out of 9 Private Universities only 2 libraries  do provide library services like OPAC, Knimbus search,  E-Resources,  through  Facebook.  The  remaining  Private  University  websites  (58.33%,  N-7)  only  provide  few  notifications,  posts,  photos,  events’  videos,  profile  of  universities,  etc.

It is also found that a majority of Deemed Universities  (66.66%,  N-10)  are  not  connected  to  Facebook  while  5  Deemed Universities (33.33%) are connected to Facebook  through  university  websites.  Among  them  websites  of  Christ  University,  Bengaluru  and  Swami  Vivekananda  Yoga Anusandhana  Samsthana,  Bengaluru  are  linked  to  library  webpages  through  Facebook  wherein  different  services  of  libraries  can  be  accessed  like  open  access  material,  repository,  research/reference  manager,  online  library,  institutional  membership,  library  user  manual,  library  links,  library  catalogue,  digital  library,  e-books,  e-journals,  newspapers,  etc.  Whereas  through  other  university websites we could only find uploading of posts,  videos,  photos,  notifications,  activities  of  universities,  latest  news,  events  and  so  on. 
It can thus be analysed that deemed universities are  lagging behind in utilising the potentialities of Facebook  compared  to  other  categories  of  universities.  Further  it  can  also  be  interpreted  that  though  more  number  of  private universities are connected to Facebook its optimum  usage  is  not  exploited  by  them  and  library  services  like  reference,  referral  and  alert  services,  which  could  be  easily  provided  with  the  help  of  such  online  social  networking  services  have  not  been  provided.  
3.1.2.YouTube 
YouTube is a video-sharing website where in one can  make available the content including teaching video clips,  
255 

========7========

DJLIT, VOL.  37,  NO.  4,  JULY   2017 
TV  clips,  music  videos,  and  also  seminar  presentations,  education  related  videos  and  library  related  videos  like  how  to  search  books,  OPAC,  e-resources,  repositories,  etc.    It  is  found  from  Table  1  that  only  5  State/Central  Universities (18.51%) are connected to Youtube networking  service with only 4 Universities accounting for (14.81%)  uploading few general videos. Except Tumkur University,  Tumkur no other university in the state has uploaded special  lectures in its website. Among the Private Universities 8  (75%)  are  connected  to  Youtube  while  only  4  Deemed  universities  (26.66%)  are  connected  to  Youtube.  Only  few general videos are uploaded by these universities. In  true sense the optimum utilisation of the Youtube social  networking services is not done by any of the university  whether  State  or  Private  or  Deemed.  
3.1.3.LinkedIn 
LinkedIn  is  a  great  way  to  get  posting  and  finding  on  jobs,  sharing  experience  and  answering  questions.  It’s  one  of  the  best  locations  to  connect  with  current  and  past  co-workers  and  potentially  future  employers  for  professionals  to  get  library  patrons  connected  with  the  people  that  can  help  them  find  information.  
It  is  found  that  among  State/Central  universities  only  Tumkur  University,  Tumkur  is  linked  to  LinkedIn  Networking site with 67 plus followers whereas Gulbarga  University website has mentioned the site but shows no  further links. No other State/Central University in the state  is  linked  to  LinkedIn.  Half  of  the  Private  Universities  (N=6)  are  linked  to  LinkedIn  Networking  site  wherein  there are great number of followers for Alliance University,  Bengaluru and Azim Premji University, Bengaluru. Reva  Institute of Technology and Management, Bengaluru has  199  followers  and  it  also  provides  detailed  profile  of  the  university.  Rai  Technology  University,  Bengaluru  and  Srinivas  University,  Mangalore  are  also  connected  to  LinkedIn.  
Only  2  Deemed  Universities  (13.33%)  namely  Jain  University, Bengaluru and IIIT, Bengaluru are connected  to LinkedIn. IIIT, Bengaluru has huge number of followers  and  it  also  updates  recent  events  through  LinkedIn.  None  of  the  other  Deemed  Universities  are  connected  to LinkedIn Networking Site. Thus it can be interpreted  that  the  potentialities  of  LinkedIn  are  not  exploited  by  a  majority  of  university  libraries  though  few  private  universities  are  quite  active  in  the  use  and  adoption  of  LinkedIn.  
3.1.4.Twitter 
Twitter allows users to write short messages of up to  140 characters, called tweets that can be read by anyone  with access to their pages. Users can utilise this platform  to  type  in  short  messages  or  status  update  and  also  to  keep  staff  and  patrons  updated  on  daily  activities,  like  frequently  updated  collections. 
Though  10  State/Central  Universities  (37.03%)  are  connected  to  Twitter  only  7  are  active.  Majority  of  the  
256 
universities  account  provide  general  tweets,  following  and  followers.  Among  them  few  of  the  accounts  also  provide  information  on  university  activities,  photos,  announcements,  notifications,  few  also  provide  certain  official tweets, recruitment tweets and conference tweets  also. As far as library services and library related activities  are concerned, no tweets are found. All the 12 universities  (100%)  are  connected  to  Twitter.    There  are  numerous  tweets, following and followers. There are photos, posts,  likes, lists uploaded in the twitter account of the various  university website. Among 15 Deemed universities only 6  (40%) of them have twitter accounts. Only general tweets,  following and followers are found and no library related  tweets  could  be  traced.  It  can  thus  be  interpreted  that  twitter  is  most  popular  among  the  Private  Universities,  but  its  utility  is  restricted  to  general  university  inquiry,  admissions  and  other  purposes  with  absolutely  no  use  is  made  for  library  activities.  
4. Other  NetWOrKINg  SIteS 
There are different social networking sites which are  useful to provide different libraries services like aNobii  helps to share reviews and recommendations on book and  also  to  inform  due  date  alerts  and  lending  services;  by  creating  a  blog,  any  information  can  be  disseminated;  A  Google+  user  profile  is  a  public  visible  account  of  a  user  that  is  attached  to  many  Google  properties.  It  includes  basic  social  networking  services  like  a  profile  photo, with directory type biographical sketch.  Pinterest  is  a  web  and  mobile  application  that  operates  a  photo  sharing  website.  Instagram  is  an  online  mobile  photo- sharing,  video-sharing,  and  social  networking  service  that  enables  its  users  to  take  pictures  and  videos,  and  share  them  either  publicly  or  privately  on  the  app,  as  well  as  through  a  variety  of  other  social  networking  platforms;  Flickr  shares  new  image  collections  and  can  create  image  sets  with  metadata.  
It is also found from the Table 1 that 5 Sate Universities  (18.51%)  are  connected  to  different  networking  sites.  Gulbarga University, Kalaburagi; VTU, Belagavi; Karnataka  Samskrit University, Bengaluru; University of Agricultural  Sciences, Dharwad are connected to google plus (Google+)  wherein photos are uploaded which are general in nature.  VTU is also connected to Flickr which displays general  photos  uploaded.  Bangalore  University  is  connected  to  BU News through which one can access different library  services  like  webOPAC,  ETD  Repositories,  etc.  
8 of the Private Universities (75%) are connected to  different social networking sites. Google plus connectivity  is  found  in  PES  University,  Bengaluru;  Reva  Institute  of Technology  and  Management,  Bengaluru;  Presidency  University, Bengaluru; Rai Technology University, Bengaluru;  Dayanand Sagar University, Bengaluru; Trans-Disciplinary  University, Bengaluru and KLE Technological University,  Hubbali  wherein  general  photos  are  uploaded.  PES  University  is  also  connected  to  Pinterest  and  Instagram  where  one  can  find  many  posts,  photos,  following  and

DEEPTHI, TADASAD & PATIL: USE OF ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES  
followers.  Presidency  University  is  also  connected  to  Pinterest,  Tumblr,  G-mail,  E-mail,  etc.  
Only 4 Deemed Universities are connected to different  networking  sites.  Christ  University  is  connected  to  Blogspot,  Flickr,  and  Google  play.  NITTE  University  is  also  connected  to  Blogspot  where  in  only  photos  are  uploaded.  Jain  University  is  connected  to  Google  plus,  and Instagram and Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana  Samstana is connected to Google plus where general photos  are  uploaded.  Again  it  can  be  analysed  that  these  are  all  used  for  general  purposes  and  usage  of  these  social  media  for  library  purpose  is  completely  neglected.  
5.   cON cLUSIONS 
The  study  has  revealed  many  facts  about  use  of  various social networking services among the University  libraries.  University  libraries  are  showing  inclination  towards  the  adoption  and  use  of  such  services.  But  the  potentialities  of  these  services  need  to  be  assessed  properly against the demographic characteristics of the user  community it is serving. Keeping in view the importance  of social networking site and the need of user community,  university libraries should develop a comprehensive Social  networking  service  usage  policy.  There  are  differences  across  the  libraries  in  using  social  networking  services  for  different  purposes,  from  marketing  and  promotion,  to  opening  up  the  resources  of  the  library  to  providing  customer service to many possibilities. It can be used as  complimentary  tool  to  traditional  services.  Since  these  are  quite  helpful  in  providing  alert  services  and  also  quite  helpful  in  outreach  activities,  the  adoption  and  usage  of  social  networking  services  need  to  be  geared  up  by  the  university  libraries  in  the  state.
