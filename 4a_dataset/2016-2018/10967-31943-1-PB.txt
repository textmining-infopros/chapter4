Explores  the  research  output  of  Indian  Institute  of  Technology,  Madras  (IITM)  and  Indian  Institute  of  Technology,  Bombay  (IITB)  in  the  area  of  engineering  sciences during 2006-2015. IITB was established in 1958  with  the  assistance  of  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organisation  (UNESCO)  and  the  former  Soviet  Union.  It  has  an  extensive  graduate  program offering doctoral degrees in Science, Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics. Currently IITB has a total  of  14  academic  departments,  six  centers,  one  school,  and  three  interdisciplinary  programmes.  Over  the  last  53  years,  around  39,000  engineers  and  scientists  have  graduated  from  the  institute. 
IITM is one among the foremost institutes of national  importance  in  higher  technological  education,  basic  and  applied  research.  It  was  established  in  1959  with  the  assistance  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  to  provide  education  and  research  facilities  in  engineering  and technology. These two IITs are the oldest IITs after  IIT Kharagapur and produce major chunks of innovative  ideas and publications. It will be interesting to know the  actual productivity of two IITs and to know which of the  two IITs have more impact on national and international  level  in  terms  of  publication  output  and  their  impact  in  terms  of  citations.  The  study  is  based  on  the  papers  indexed by Elsevier’s Scopus  database from 2006-2015.  Scientometric  indicators  used  in  the  study  have  been  explained  in  the  succeeding  paragraphs.

Review  of  related  literature  is  a  part  and  parcel  of  any research investigation which empowers the investigator  to make out the prior research interests, research patterns  and  the  significance  of  the  research  output  in  a  field  of  knowledge.  In  various  fields  including  science  and  engineering, few studies have been reported in literature  which  analysed  the  scientific  output  of  institutions.  For  instance,  Prathap  &  Gupta1   analysed  the  research  performances  of  Indian  Engineering  and  technological  institutes  for  the  period  1999-2008,  which  shows  how  these institutes acts as  generators of new knowledge in  the higher education sectors of India.

impact.  RCI  is  a  measure  of  both  the  influence  and  visibility  of  a  nation’s  research  in  global  perspective.  It  is  defined  as  “a  country’s  share  of  world  citations  in

the subspecialty/country’s share of world publications in  the  subspecialty”.  RCI  =  1  denotes  a  country’s  citation  rate  equal  to  world  citation  rate;  RCI  <  1  indicates  a  country’s  citation  rate  less  than  world  citation  rate  and  also  implies  that  the  research  efforts  are  higher  than  its  impact; and RCI > 1 indicates a country’s higher citation  rate than world’s citation rate and also imply high impact  research  in  that  country.  Here  CPP  and  RCI  have  been  used  for  a  meaning  comparison  of  the  impact  of  the  research output for different sub-disciplines and the two  IITs  under  study.  These  indicators  have  been  used  by  Dwivedi13,  et  al.  for  assessment  of  organic  chemistry  research in India (add this in reference list). The h-index  suggested  by  Hirsch  has  been  used  to  rank  the  prolific  authors.  The  h-index  of  a  scientist  is  [h]  if  [h]  among  his/her  [N]  articles  have  at  least  [h]  citations  each  and  
research  results  are  very  important.  The  results  of  the  analysis  on  the  document  types  are  given  in Table  1.  It  indicates  that  the  academicians  from  both  the  institutes  preferred  to  publish  their  research  results  in  journals.  However,  scientists  of  IITB  have  much  higher  share  of  conference  papers  as  compared  to  IITM.  One  possible  reason  for  this  may  be  that  the  researchers  want  their  results  to  be  noticed  by  the  professionals  as  early  as  possible, because publishing in journals take longer than  conference papers. Also in the discipline of engineering  sciences  conferences  are  considered  as  important  as  the  research  articles  in  journals. 
6.2. growth  Pattern  of output 
Figure 1 depicts the absolute output of IITM and IITB  during  2005-2015.  It  indicates  that  in  the  initial  years  
other  (i.e.,  remaining  [N-h])  articles  have  fewer  than  h  
the  output  is  low,  but  in  the  later  periods  the  output  of  
both  institutes  has  grown  continuously  reaching  a  peak  
citations each. An h-index, say, of 10 of a scientist means  that  among  all  the  articles  published  by  the  scientist  have  received  at  least  10  citations  each14.

6.1.  Research  Results communicating documents 
During  2006-2015,  the  researchers  from  IITM  published  5378  papers  and  the  researchers  from  IITB  published 4430 papers on various aspects of engineering  sciences  in  different  type  of  document  sources.  The  selection of an appropriate outlet often has an influence  on the visibility and impact of a research article. Hence,  analyses of the types of document used for communicating

in  the  year  2014  with  a  slight  decline  for  IITM  in  the  year 2011. The low output in 2015 for both the institutes  may be that some papers published in journals appearing  late  might  have  not  been  included  in  the  output.  The  Compound  Annual  Growth  Rate  (CAGR)  calculated  by  using  the  formula  available  at  www.investopedia.com/ calculator/cagr.aspx  was  found  to  be  4.4  for  IITM  and  6.4  for  IITB.

of  publications  (TNP),  total  number  of  citations  (TNC)  obtained  by  each  discipline  along  with  the  values  of  Citation  per  Paper  (CPP)  and  Relative  Citation  Impact  (RCI)  for  different  sub-areas  of  engineering  sciences  research. The average value of CPP for the entire output  for IITM is 6.69, while for IITB it is 7.12. This indicates  that papers published by IITB had a higher impact value  than IITM in terms of CPP. Among all the sub-disciplines,  the  value  of  CPP  was  less  than  average  for  earth  and  planetary sciences, mathematics and computer science for  IITM. Lowest value of CPP was for earth and planetary  sciences. The values of RCI also followed similar trends  for various sub-fields. Like IITM, the value of CPP was  lowest for earth and planetary sciences. However, for other  sub-disciplines the value of CPP was close to the average  unlike IITM. The RCI values for IITB also show identical  movements  like  the  CPP  for  various  sub-disciplines. 
6.4. Information dissemination  Pattern  of  
Researchers  
To  know  the  information  dissemination  pattern  of  two  IITs  researchers’  two  distinctive  parameters  were  
signify  more  impact  than  papers  published  in  low  IF  
the scientists of IITB published their papers in 593 journal  titles published from 29 different countries including India.  Distribution  of  papers  published  in  journals  originating  from  different  countries  has  been  presented  in  Table  3.  It  indicates  that  about  33.48%  papers  by  the  scientists  of  IITM  and  39.25%  papers  by  IITB  were  published  in  journals  originating  from  the  USA.  The  number  of  papers  published  in  journals  from  UK  was  almost  the  same  for  both  IITM  and  IITB.  The  share  of  papers  published  by  the  authors  of  two  institutions  in  journals  published from India was 6.27% and 4.42% respectively  by  both  the  institutions.  This  illustrates  that  more  than  three  fourth  of  the  papers  by  the  scientists  from  the  two  IITs  were  published  in  journals  originating  from  the advanced countries of the West namely the USA, the  UK, The Netherlands and Switzerland. This indicates that  the  research  results  published  by  the  scientists  are  well  connected  to  the  mainstream  science. This  substantiates  the finding of Nagaiah and Srimannarayana15  that Indian  scientists  prefer  to  publish  in  global  journals. 
6.6.  Scattering  of  Papers According  to  Impact  
Factor  
To  ascertain  the  scattering  of  papers  according  to  
undertaken, namely the journal publishing county and the  
impact factor (IF) of the journals used for communicating  
the research results. Papers published in higher IF journals  
impact  factor  authors  have  classified  impact  factor  into  
four categories. These are 0–1 (low), >1 to ≤ 3 (medium),  journals.  Also,  journals  published  from  the  advanced  
>  3  to  ≤  5  (high)  and  >  5  (very  high).  Distribution  of  countries,  command  more  respect  and  prime  channel  
output  according  to  the  magnitude  of  impact  factor  is  
given  in Table  4.  It  indicates  that  about  17%  papers  by  
connectedness as distinguished to journals published from  India  or  other  developing  countries. The  findings  based  on  these  two  parameters  have  been  narrated  below.  
6.5. national  vs. global journals  
The scientists of IITM published their papers in 771  journals published from 31 countries including India and  
the scientists of IITM and 14.4% papers by the scientists  of  IITB  were  published  in  low  impact  factor  journals.  About two-third of the papers by both IITs were published  in  medium  IF  journals.  However,  the  number  of  papers  in high and very high impact factor journals for IITB is  slightly  higher  than  the  IITM.  Based  on  this  criterion,

one  can  conclude  that  the  papers  published  by  both  the  IITs  is  linked  to  the  main  stream  science  as  more  than  four-fifth  of  the  published  papers  appeared  in  medium  and  high  impact  factor  journals.  
6.7.  Most common journals used  for  Publishing  
Research  Rsesults  
Journals are regarded as one of the primary sources  of  information  which  has  become  the  fastest  and  most  effective  means  of  disseminating  research  findings.  A  higher  emergence  rate  of  periodicals  in  a  subject  field  can  be  a  measure  of  the  growth  of  knowledge  in  that  field.  It  is  an  accepted  fact  that  in  the  field  of  science  there  is  apparently  an  increasing  rate  of  emergence  of  new journals to meet the rapid explosion of information.

indication  of  the  influence  or  visibility  of  individuals  or  groups  or  institutions.  Noteworthy  citations  to  a  scientific  publication  have  been  elucidated  as  symbol  of  scientific  supremacy.  An  author’s  perceptibility  can  be  deliberated  through  a  calculation  of  how  frequently  their publications have been cited in other publications.  The  consequences  of  research  can  thus  be  appraised  by  building  citation  counts  of  the  articles  received  over  a  period  of  time.

by  papers  during  2006-2015.  Out  of  the  total  papers  published by scientists of IITM, about one-fifth (19.66%)  of  the  papers  did  not  get  any  citation  and  the  rest  80.33%  were  cited  one  or  more  times.  Out  of  the  total  cited  papers  about  (35.75%)  were  cited  between  1-5  times  and  16.88%  were  cited  6-10  times.  Thus,  about  half (53%) of the papers were cited between 1-10 times.  Rest  (27%)  was  cited  more  than  10  times.  Out  of  the  total  papers  published  by  scientists  of  IITB,  one-fourth  (26.54%)  of  the  papers  did  not  get  any  citation  and  the  rest  73.45%  were  cited  one  or  more  times.  Out  of  the  total  cited  papers  around  (41.12%)  were  cited  between  1-5  times  and  11.61%  were  cited  6-10  times.  Thus,  about  (52.73%)  of  the  papers  were  cited  between  1-10  times.  Rest  (20.72%)  was  cited  more  than  10  times.  Based on the pattern of citations also, one can conclude  that the scientific output of both the IITs in engineering  sciences  is  well  connected  to  the  mainstream  science  as  more  than  two  third  of  the  papers  were  cited  in  the  international  literature.

continuously throughout the study period. Highest numbers  of  papers  were  published  in  the  discipline  of  material  science  by  scientists  of  both  the  IITs  with  highest  influence  in  terms  of  CPP  and  RCI.  From  the  angle  of  the  distribution  of  published  papers  in  journals  by  country, the scientists of both the IITs prefer to publish  their  papers  in  journals  published  from  the  advanced  countries of the West. More number of papers published  by researchers from IITB was highly cited as compared  to  IITM.
