ABSTRACT 
Presents a trend of doctoral research activities undertaken in social sciences across the institutes of higher  learning in India. The study is based on the secondary data compiled from the bibliography of doctoral dissertations,  published on an annual basis by the Association of Indian Universities in India, in the feld of social sciences during  2010-2014. The study revealed that in all, 5788 doctoral degrees were awarded across 171 institutes of Higher  Learning in India in as many as 17 different social science subject disciplines, with an average of 340.47 doctoral  degrees  in  each  subject  feld.  On  an  average,  each  individual,  institution  has  awarded  33.84  doctoral  degrees.  Education, commerce and economics are the three leading subject disciplines, in which maximum doctoral degrees  were awarded, while as Tourism stands at the bottom. Similarly, at the state level, the maximum doctoral degrees  were awarded from Gujarat, which is followed by Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, while as at institutional level;  Dr B.R. Amedkar Marathwada University, Jawaharlal University and Maharishi Dayanand University are the three  leading institutes across the country, which awarded the maximum number of doctoral degrees.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
India  is  a  very  vast  country  having  over  1.25  billion  population, spread across 36 states and union territories, having  more than 759 universities1  and over 35,500 affliated colleges  with an enrollment capacity of over 20 million students, speaks  itself about the vastness and the magnanimity of Indian higher  education  system2.  The  majority  of  the  students  enrolled  in  these  higher  education  institutions  pursue  their  bachelor’s  degree  courses  and  less  than  01  percent  of  these  enrolled  students pursue their doctoral degrees.  
The  popularity  of  any  given  subject  discipline  gets  assessed by the amount of doctoral research undertaken by the  research scholars in a particular subject discipline over a period  of time. It is a common practice among researchers in general  and library and information science researchers in particular to  assess the doctoral research output in subject disciplines at an  individual level. The trend of assessing the doctoral research  output at the collective level in the subject disciplines falling  under  social  sciences,  humanities  or  pure  sciences  is  very  uncommon. Accordingly, in the present study an attempt has  been made to assess the doctoral degrees awarded in the social  sciences in India during 2010 to 2014.  
Research undertaken in the subject disciplines of social  sciences has got a direct bearing on the overall well being and  betterment  of  a  society.  The  greater  the  amount  of  research  conducted in any social sciences disciplines, higher will be its

impact on the society in general and the end users in particular.  It is always imperative that scholars undertaking research in  any social science subject should produce quality results and  the doctoral degree awarded should not be mere degree sake.  And so have got research supervisors an important role to play  in grooming the budding scholars as serious researchers3. The  research  supervisors  own  experience  can  help  a  great  deal  in inspiring researchers to handle a real time problem and in  undertaking quality research to overcome it. 
The present study is purely undertaken on the secondary  data,  compiled  from  the  annual  bibliographies  published  in  the social sciences by the Association of Indian Universities,  New  Delhi.  Here  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  refect  the  overall doctoral research scenario of the social science subject  disciplines  in  India.  The  study  simply  refects  the  research  trends  in  the  social  sciences  as  the  fgures  refected  are  not  exhaustive in nature. 
2.  LITERATURE REvIEw 
Undertaking  research  at  the  doctoral  level  is  a  very  common practice among the scholars all across the globe it so  holds true of evaluate and assess the research output at different  levels to refect the strengths and weaknesses in the research  activities  undertaken  by  the  research  scholars  of  any  given  institutions, in any given subject disciplines or in any given  country. The doctoral dissertations have their own importance  in creating new academic knowledge, be it about disciplinary  tradition, trends or research techniques4.Researchers in Turkey  evaluated the doctoral dissertations in Music awarded between

1986  and  2009  across  15  universites5.  Gazi  and  Marmara  Universities were found the leading research universities in the  Turkey in music education. In a similar study conducted at the  Turkish Universities to assess the doctoral degrees awarded in  economics from 1990-2011, the researchers found that 1906  doctoral degrees were awarded by the universities, supervised  by  as  many  as  617  professors6.  Here  again  the  researchers  observed Marmara as 01 of the leading universities of Turkey  to award the doctoral degrees.  
With the view to the future of doctoral research in logistics  and supply chain management, 609 doctoral dissertations were  evaluated by the researchers published from 2005-20097. The researchers identify the emerging areas of research in the given  subject  discipline  and  found  the  future  of  the  given  subject  discipline quite promising. 
Library  and  information  science  is  01  of  the  leading  subject disciplines in the feld of social sciences in which a good  number of studies have been conducted to assess the doctoral  research output. Of the total doctoral degrees awarded in the  feld  of  library  and  information  sciences  during  2007-2011  in the North-Eastern Region of India, 38.09 per cent doctoral  degrees were al01 awarded in the Meghalaya8. A growing trend  was observed in the award of doctoral degrees in the library and  information science in India from 1952 to 19999. The researcher  observed that the maximum 98 doctoral degrees were awarded  in LIS during 1980’s. Of the 198 doctoral degrees awarded in  library and information science India during the period 1997- 2003, 51 degrees were awarded from the northern region of  the country, 72 from the southern region, 22 from east and 19  from the western region of the country10. From 2003 to 2008,  171 doctoral degrees were awarded in library and information  science across 20 states, 49 Universities in India11. 
Similarly,  researchers studied  the  doctoral  dissertations  awarded in the feld of internet communication facilities in  Spain, awarded during 1997-201212. The aspects like, language,  research output, research growth, distribution of dissertations  awarded, faculties, etc., were studied. Researchers quantifed  the six popular social science subjects, business, economics,  psychology, sociology, library & information science, history  and philosophy13   by  evaluating  their  research  output  at  the  global level by evaluating ISI indexed journals. The US, UK  and Canada were found as the leading social science research  countries in the world. Propensity among the research scholars  of  Belgium  to  attain  doctoral  degrees  from  the  fve  largest  universities of Flanders was studied on the basis of FWO and  IWT  fellowships,  whereby  research  fellows  are  supposed  to complete their doctoral work with a time limit viz., four  year  period14.  To  assess  the  contribution  of  economics  to  the  tourism,  118  doctoral  dissertations  awarded  in  the  US,  Canada, Australia, and the New Zealand during 2000-2010 in  the subject discipline of tourism were evaluated15.  
The  researchers  observed  that  compared  to  researchers  from Thailand, the researchers from US were more ethical in  their research activity16.  To undertake the study, the researchers  analysed the 10 qualitative doctoral dissertations awarded in  the Thailand and the US during 2001-2010. The difference was  owed to lack of knowledge among the researchers of Thailand  towards research ethics. Similarly, it was revealed that a total  
of 253 doctoral degrees awarded in the Social work in Sweden  during 1970 to 200917.  
In  the  United  States  from  1953  to  1962  across  181  universities, 93977 doctoral degrees were awarded in the feld  of humanities, biological sciences, social sciences, and physical  sciences18. The California and the Colombia universities were  found  to  be  the  leading  universities  to  award  the  maximum  number of doctoral degrees, 5644 and 5024 respectively.  Two- third (58150) doctoral degrees were awarded by the leading  30  institutes  in  the  United  States.  To  assess  the  growth  of  doctoral degrees awarded on fve year period basis from 1880- 1984 in the subject felds like natural sciences, social sciences,  arts literature, library science, information science, computer  science  and  health  science,  the  researchers  searched  the  Dissertations Abstracts database and observed a steady growth  in  the  award  of  doctoral  degrees.  During  1880-84,  only  29  doctoral degrees were awarded in social sciences in the US and  the number kept on steadily increasing through the century, as  68710 doctoral degrees were awarded in social science during  1980-198419.  
3.  OBJECTIvES 
• To present an overview of the research output in the feld  
of social sciences in India and the research distribution  
across  different  states  of  the  country  during  the  period  
2010-2014. 
• To  workout  the  distribution  of  doctoral  research  output  
and to identify the leading research institutes across India  
in the feld of social sciences.  
• To  analyse  the  subject  wise  distribution  of  doctoral  
research output in the feld of social sciences along with  
popularity  of  each  individual  subject  both  at  the  state  
and institutional level.  
4.  METHODOLOGY 
The present study has been undertaken on the secondary  data collected and compiled from the annual bibliographical  directories, published by the Association of India University  (AIU),  in  the  feld  of  social  sciences  for  the  period  (2010- 2014)20.  An  attempt  has  been  made  to  refect  the  average  number of doctoral degrees awarded  
5.  LIMITATIONS 
Although the study is limited to the territorial jurisdiction  of India, but can prove of great help to researchers all across  the globe while generalising the doctoral research output in a  particular subject discipline in general and social sciences in  particular. The directory of doctoral research output published  by the AIU by no means can be considered as an exhaustive  compilation,  as  against  759  universities  fully  functional  and  actively  involved  in  research  and  academic  activities  across  the  length  and  breadth  of  India,  only  171  (22.23  per  cent)  universities have reported their doctoral research output record  to  the  AIU.  There  is  no  reason  to  consider,  that  the  other  universities in the county were not actively involved with the  research activities or may not have awarded doctoral degrees  in the feld of social sciences during the last fve years. Given  the fact, the present study simply refects a doctoral research

trend across different subject disciplines in the feld of social  sciences in India. 
6.  RESULTS 
In all 5788 doctoral degrees were awarded in the feld of  social sciences across India from 2010 through 2014 by 171  institutes in 17 different subject felds. In the year 2014 doctoral  degrees were awarded in 16 different subject felds, while as in  the remaining years of study the degrees were awarded in 17  different  subject  felds.  On  average  340.47  doctoral  degrees  were awarded in each subject feld during the period of study  as shown in Table 1.  
On average 33.84 doctoral degrees were awarded by each  individual  contributing  institution  in  each  year. A  maximum  1598 (27.60 per cent) doctoral degrees were awarded in the  year 2011, however a steady decline can be observed in the

number of doctoral degrees awarded as we move towards the  year 2014. On average 1157.6 doctoral degrees were awarded  during  each  year  with  an  average  of  6.76  degrees  by  each  individual institution in each year, which constitutes less than  01 doctoral degree in each subject discipline. 
Education is the leading subject feld in which maximum  983 (16.98 per cent) doctoral degrees were awarded, with an  average  196.60  doctoral  degrees  in  each  year.  Education  is  followed by commerce and economics with a share percentage  of  13.52  per  cent  and  11.57  per  cent  doctoral  degrees  respectively. On average 156.60 and 134 doctoral degrees were  awarded  in  the  feld  of  commerce  and  economics  each  year  respectively. A minimum of 8 doctoral degrees were awarded  in the feld of tourism during the period of study with less than  two doctoral degrees each year.  On an average 68.09 doctoral  degrees were awarded in each individual subject each year as  shown in Table 2.   
From the analysis, it emerges that there is no uniformity  in the pattern of doctoral degrees awarded across the country.  The subject disciplines like education, commerce, economics,  management  and  political  science  enjoy  a  fair  amount  of  popularity across the country and are being widely pursued by  scholars at the doctoral level.  
Out of 36 states and union territories of the country, 30  (83.33 per cent) states and union territories were found, from  where doctoral degrees were awarded during the period of study.  On average 192.93 doctoral degrees were awarded from each  state. Gujarat leads the table with a maximum 742, (12.81 per  cent) doctoral degrees awarded during the period. Maharashtra,  Andhra Pradesh, and New Delhi are the other leading states  to  award  doctoral  degrees  in  social  sciences.  On  average,

148.40 doctoral degrees were awarded from Gujarat each year.  Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, New Delhi and Karnataka are  the other states from where more than 100 doctoral degrees  were awarded each year. Sikkim is the only state where from  only  01  doctoral  degree  has  been  awarded  during  the  last  fve years. Only one (3.33 per cent) states awarded less than  one  doctoral  degree  in  a  year,  while  as  8  (26.66  per  cent) states  awarded  1  to  10  doctoral  degrees  each  year,  16  (53.33 per cent) states awarded 11 to 83 doctoral degrees and 5  (16.66 per cent) states awarded more than 100 doctoral degrees  each year. In terms of percentage share, 10 states have awarded  less than 1 per cent doctoral degree, 8 states have awarded 1 to  2 per cent doctoral degrees, while as, 12 states have awarded  doctoral degrees with a share percentage between 2 to 13 per  
cent each as shown in Table 3.  
Of  the  759  universities  listed  on  the  UGC  website,  47  (6.19 per cent) are Central Universities, 350 (46.11 per cent) State Universities, 123 (16.20 per cent) Deemed Universities  and 239 (31.48 per cent) are private Universities.  The doctoral  research  output  under  analysis  has  been  recorded  from  171  universities of the country, which also means that only 22.23  per  cent  universities  are  actively  engaged  with  the  doctoral  research activities as shown in Table 4.   
More  than  60  per  cent  of  the  doctoral  degrees  were  awarded by the twenty leading universities of India, while as  the remaining 40 per cent doctoral degrees were awarded by  151  universities/institutes  across  India.

PANDITA  & S INGH : DOCTORAL  R ESEARCH  O UTPUT IN  S OCIAL  S CIENCES IN  I NDIA: A STUDy (2010-2014) 
University,  New  Delhi  and  Maharishi  Dayanand  University,  Haryana  are  the  three  leading  universities,  which  have  awarded the maximum number of doctoral degrees. Dr B.R.  Ambedkar  University,  Maharashtra  awarded  the  maximum  343 doctoral degrees, with an average of 68.6 degrees in each  year at an average of 21.43 doctoral degrees in each subject  discipline. Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi on average  awarded  65  doctoral  degrees  each  year,  with  an  average  of  27.08  doctoral  degrees  in  each  subject  discipline.  Similarly,  Maharishi Dayanand University, Haryana on average awarded  24.9  doctoral  degrees  in  each  subject  feld  with  an  overall  average of 54.8 doctoral degrees each year.  On average 340.47  doctoral degrees were awarded in each subject feld during the  period of study.  
Subject disciplines like Commerce, Psychology, Physical  Education  &  Sports,  Library  and  Information  Science  and  Tourism  enjoy  maximum  popularity  in  Dr  B.R.  Ambedkar  Marathwads University, while as Economics, Political Science  and  Sociology  enjoy  their  stronghold  in  Jawaharlal  Nehru  University.  Maharishi  Dayanand  University  awarded  the  maximum degrees in Education & Law and Osmania University  in Management and Public Administration. Similarly, subjects  like,  Education,  Psychology,  Law,  Library  &  Information  Science  &  Home  Science  are  popular  in  Gujarat,  while  as  Commerce,  Economics,  Physical  Education  &  Sports  and  Tourism are more popular in Maharashtra as shown in Table  5.   
On  average  of  49.42  doctoral  degrees  were  awarded  in  Gujarat in each subject discipline, which is the highest number  of average doctoral degrees awarded by any state. Gujarat is  followed by Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh with an average  
of 42.37 & 35.68 doctoral degrees in each subject discipline,  respectively.  Gujarat,  Maharashtra,  Andhra  Pradesh,  New  Delhi,  Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Haryana,  Orissa,  West  Bengal and Utter Pradesh are some of the leading states of the  country which offer research opportunities to scholars in almost  95 per cent subject felds.  Education, commerce, Economics,  Management Studies, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology  and Law are the popular subject feld, as most of the states have  awarded doctoral degrees in these subject felds as shown in  Table 5.   
7.  DISCUSSION AND   C ONCLUSIONS 
Conventional  subject  disciplines  like  Education,  Commerce,  Economics,  and  Political  Science  are  still  quite  popular and preferred subject disciplines in social sciences in  India, given the number of doctoral degrees awarded in these  subject  disciplines  during  the  period  of  study.  Management  Studies, Psychology, Sociology and Law are the other leading  subject disciplines being pursued with great interest by scholars  at the doctoral level. However, less than 100 doctoral degrees  have  been  awarded  in  the  subject  disciplines  like  Tourism,  Business  Administration,  Social  Work,  Anthropology  and  Journalism  and  Mass  Communication  which  is  an  area  of  concern. These subject disciplines need to promote the doctoral  research activities among students. Subject disciplines which  fail  to  add  new  knowledge  to  the  existing  lot  are  bound  to  suffer and may ultimately fnd no takers. Subject disciplines  like Physical Education and Sports, Library and Information  Science,  Public  Administration  and  Home  Science  need  to  equally promote the research at the doctoral level.  
The  states  having  a  fair  number  of  universities  have

awarded more doctoral degrees for obvious reasons. However,  a  disproportionate  trend  can  be  observed  in  the  number  of  doctoral degrees awarded by each individual institution. There  is a need to look into the reasons, as why some universities  are  more  actively  involved  with  research  activities,  while  as  others  are  not  so,  given  the  number  of  doctoral  degrees  awarded  by  these  institutions  during  the  same  period.  The  disproportionate  research  trend  among  institutions  leave  enough scope for further study in this direction. Nevertheless,

availability  of  supervisory  staff,  infrastructure,  and  research  grants  etc.  can  be  inferred  as  the  primary  reasons  for  these  existing differences. A strong correlation was being observed  between  the  library  resources  and  the  doctoral  degrees  awarded across American universities21.As per ACE Summary  nearly two third of the doctoral degrees awarded across 120  universities of the America during 1957-66 came from 38 per  cent  such  institutions,  which  had  a  library  collection  over  a  million volumes each18. Richness and Resourcefulness of an  

========7========

PANDITA  & S INGH : DOCTORAL  R ESEARCH  O UTPUT IN  S OCIAL  S CIENCES IN  I NDIA: A STUDy (2010-2014) 
institutional library can be considered as an important factor  to support the research activities and so should emphasis be  laid on creating the research infrastructure among institutions  which is imperative for undertaking quality research. Modern  day libraries play a very signifcant and more proactive role in  accomplishing doctoral degrees in any academic or research  institution.  Similarly emphasis should be laid on establishing  good  labs,  IT  infrastructure,  supervisory  staff  to  promote  research environment.  
States  like,  Assam,  Tamil  Nadu,  Jammu  &  Kashmir,  Manipur, Rajasthan, Pondicherry, Kerala, Mizoram, Arunachal  Pradesh,  Bihar,  Nagaland,  Tripura,  Uttarakhand  and  Sikkim  have  awarded  less  than  100  doctoral  degrees  during  the  period  of  study. The  universities  and  other  higher  education  institutions established in these states need to seek out ways and  means whereby they can improve the state of research in their  respective states. What is more worrisome about these states  is that they have recorded a disproportionate doctoral research  output  given  the  number  of  subject  disciplines  studied.  The  Uttarakhand and the Sikkim stand at the bottom by awarding  08 and 01 doctoral degrees respectively.  
Expansion of higher education is important for the overall  growth and development of the country, along with provision  of easy accesses and bringing higher education at the doorsteps  of the public. Private Universities are emerging as 01 of the  strongest  pillars  of  Indian  Higher  Education  System. As  on  date, nearly 32 per cent universities across India are private  and these universities are doing very well in their respective  felds. 
The  Association  of  Indian  Universities  is  compiling  the  bibliography  of  doctoral  dissertations  awarded  in  social  sciences  in  India,  but  given  the  total  number  of  universities  functioning  in  India  and  the  number  of  universities,  which  have contributed their doctoral research output details to the  AIU,  the  bibliography  of  doctoral  Dissertations  cannot  be  considered as comprehensive. A total of 171 (22.23 per cent)  universities reported their doctoral research output to the AIU,  which doesn’t mean the remaining 77 per cent universities in  India did not award any doctoral degree from 2010-2014. The  case is simply that either these universities did not award any  doctoral degree during the period of study or these universities  or institutions did not report their doctoral output to AIU. It  would be appropriate, if AIU in consonance with UGC will  make it mandatory and binding upon all the Higher Education  Institutions in India, to fle the bibliographical details of their  doctoral research output with AIU. This will help in creating a  comprehensive, exhaustive and authoritative national record of  the doctoral degrees awarded in the country.  
Gujarat proved its research prowess by emerging as a hot  destination of social science research in India. Nearly 13 per cent  of doctoral degrees in India were awarded by the universities  and other higher educational institutions of Gujarat.
