The paper presents the results of a study about the fve Web OPACs of Northern Indian Universities namely,  Aligarh Muslim University, University of Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru University, University of Kashmir, and Punjab  University after administering thirty three standard search terms in the feld of Economics to the selected Web OPACs  for discovering and retrieving information about the knowledge resources held  by the  respective universities.  These Web OPACs were evaluated by taking into account the frst twenty results pertaining to each ‘search query’  for estimation of relative recall and precision. The study reveals that ‘Mean Relative Recall’ falls in a low range  
in relation to precision.

1. IntROdUCtIOn 
An  ‘OPAC’  is  an  essential  discovery  and  retrieval  tool  which  assists  to  locate,  retrieve  and  deliver  the  library  resources  to  patrons  efficiently  and  effectively.  The  resources  of  an  academic  or  research  organisation  are  thrown  open  remotely  through  Web-based  OPAC  which allow multi dimensional searches through different  access  points  depending  upon  customisation,  software,  need or demand of an organisation. Moreover, the present  Web  dependent  world  has  brought  with  it  a  new  virtual  retrieval tool in the shape of ‘Web OPAC’. Its development  is  a  paradigm  shift  from  centralised  systems,  designed  and  controlled  by  system  designers  and  programmers,  to  more  and  more  distributed  and  customisable  system.  Commenting  on    its  rewards  over  the  linear  search  provisions, available in earlier form of physical catalogues,  it is noted that users were satisfied to a great extent with  OPAC  in  early  nineties  but  the  situation  has    changed  drastically  with  the  popularity  of  Web  search  engines   which    provide    an    opportunity  for  easier,  quicker  and  virtual means of finding information about resources1.

The  primary    objective  of  this  research  here  is      to  estimate    Relative  Recall  and  Precision  of  the      Web  OPAC  and  correlation  thereof.  However,  the  study  is  limited  only  to  five  Indian  Universities  in  the  field  of  Economics. The selected Universities   comprise of three  central  universities  and  two  state  universities      situated  in  Northern  India. These  are:

‘Precision’ is the number of retrieved documents that  are  relevant  to  a  query  while  ‘Recall’  is  the  number  of  ‘truly’ relevant documents that are effectively retrieved.  ‘Precision’ is a measure of ‘Soundness’ of the IR system  while  ‘Recall’  provides  a  measure  of  ‘Completeness’  of  the system4. Xu & Lancaster5  has made  an  analysis of  205  records  selected  at  random  from  the  OCLC  Online  Computer Library Centre and have reported  overlapping  in the subject access points provided by the title, subject  heading  and  classification  number  fields  and    have   concluded    that    online  catalogue  outperform  the  card  catalogue  more  in  precision  than  in  recall.  In  the  same  sequence, Larson6, et al. pronounced that the   controlled  subject vocabulary searching has increased the precision of  results and also has saved the time of the user by reducing  
by  overly  general  natural  language.  It  is  reported  that

The  study  was  carried  out  in  three  stages: 
(a) First  Stage:  The  related  publications  available  in  
electronic  format  were  reviewed  which  helped  us  
to  evolve  a  suitable  scale  for  the  estimation  of  the  
values. 
(b) Second stage: The five Universities having Economics  
as  a  course  of  academics  were  identified  for  the  
study. 
(c) Third  Stage:  The  University  Web  OPACs  were  
accessed  for  the  select  terms  from  December  2014  
to March 2015. Finally data retrieved was analysed    
to  arrive  at      present  results. 
The  detailed  procedure  adopted  for  the  study  is

implementation may help to increase  the recall in subject  search. Cherry & Clinton10  while making a study of five  Toronto universities Web OPAC , in the context of user  profiles, have reported that zero hit subject searches  for  user  queries  improve  recall.  However,  Subject  headings   could  prove a key component in its  improvement  that  will    also    provide  a  greater  precision  in  subject  search   in  future  emerging    catalogues11. 
Besides,  many  studies  revolved  round  Indian  and  Pakistani academic library  Web OPAC which mainly have   discussed their general features,  general interface or subject  interface  in  detail  without  analysing  their  precision  or  recall measures. Most OPACs  in the academic  set up  of   India offer the basic search features required by users and   belong to what is often referred to as ‘second-generation  catalogues’12. The features and functions of indigenously  developed web-based catalogues of academic, special and  national libraries of Pakistan indicate that indigenous Web  OPACs  are  at  an  initial  stage  of  development    offering  basic  facilities  to  their  users.  These  Web  OPACs  are  not  presenting  such  facilities  yet,  which    in  advanced  countries are being presently provided13. It is also reported  by Madhusudhan & Agarwal14   that  six  Indian  IITs  Web  OPAC lag  much  behind in exploiting the full potential  of  the  library  portal  and  federated  search  facilities. The  University  Libraries,  in  Chandigarh  and  Punjab,  it  is  advocated  by  Kumar  & Vohra15,  that    these  institutions    
minimum  two  isolates  so  to  constitute  a  list  of  thirty  three  expressions.(Annexure  I). 
4.2   m ode  of  Searching  Subject  terms 
  All  Web  OPACs  of  the  selected  universities  offer  two modes of searching, i.e., simple and advanced search.  This  study  adopted  the  advanced  search  to  retrieve  the  documents  on  a  particular  ‘query  search’  submitted  to  Web  OPAC.  The  Web  OPACs  of  JNU  and  AMU  offer  subject  and  title  approach  as  main  access  point  while  in  DU,  OPAC,  it  is  being  accessed  through  title  and  the  software  has  adopted  description  option  instead  of  subject  approach  and    PU  OPAC  uses  keyword  instead  of subject approach. In Advance Search, Boolean options  (OR/AND)  between  Title  and  Subject  are  used  for  retrieving  the  resources. 
4.3  Estimation  of  Relative  Recall  and  Precision  
The  recall  is  the  ability  of  a  retrieval  system  to  obtain all or most of relevant documents in the collection.  Thus  it  requires  knowledge,  not  just  of  the  ‘relevant’  retrieved  records  but  those  of  ‘not  relevant’  records  retrieved as well from the system.  There exist no precise   method  of  calculating  ‘absolute’  recall  of  Web  OPACs.  However,  Clark  and  Willet  have  adapted  the  traditional  recall  measurement  for  use  in  Web  environment    after   
in  collaboration  with  software  designers  should  explore   
giving it a relative flavour15. The  study  has  accordingly  a    mechanism  to  add  new  features  in  their    Web  OPAC   
followed this method, i.e., by pooling the relevant results  
of  individual  searches  to  form  the  denominator  of  the  
e.g,  faceted  navigation,  federated  search,  etc.

calculations. Thus, the recall value after giving a relative  flavour  is  defined  as:

In  this  study  N  is  5  (five) 
If  five  universities  are  represented  by  A,  B,  C,  D,  and  E  and  Hoi  represent  items  (hits)  retrieved  by    a  particular university for a particular term(s), the formula  can  be  expressed  as:

            Aoi + Boi + Coi + Doi + Eoi 
If    hits  retrieved  by  a  Web  OPAC  for  ‘Financial  Economics’  are:  12,  14,  10,  11  and  16  respectively,  the  Relative  recall  of  a  particular  university  a  (here  represented  by  ‘Aoi’)  will  be  as: 
  i.e.,    12/12+14+10+11+16  =  12/63=  0.19

Based  on  the  above  data,  if  the  score  of  resources  reaches  26,  the  precision  (P)  for  a  particular  university  (here also represented by Aoi) for ‘Financial Economics’  comes  to  26/20=1.30 
The precision estimated from 33 selected terms was  later  categorised  into  four  ranges  in Table  3. 
table 3. Categorisation of precision (Range) 
The relative recall estimated  from  33 (thirty three)    identified  terms  was,  for  the  sake  of  convenience,  later  categorised  into  four  different  ranges  Table  1  to  arrive  
at  a  result  oriented  conclusion  particularly  for  bigger  data.

On  the  other  hand,  precision  is  the  fraction  of  a  search  output  that  is  relevant  for  a  particular  query.  Its  calculation,  hence,  requires  knowledge  of  the  relevant  and non relevant hits for the evaluated set of documents.   Clarke  &  Willet15   determine  the  relevance  of  these  resources,  on  a  six  point  ‘Likert  scale’  which  enables  us to calculate precision.

The  documents retrieved (about 97%) from  Economics  fall  in  the  lowest  range  (0.00-0.19)  for  KU  and  PU  followed  by  DU  and  JNU  in  contrast  to  number  of  document, being lowest, retrieved in range of 0.20-0.49   by  KU  and    PU  OPACs.  But,  the  Web  OPAC  of   AMU  show  highest  (50%)  documents  retrieval  in  range  of  0.80-1.99  and  leaving  other  resources  for  lowest  range  (about  12%).

5.2  Precision 
The  study  reveals  that  all  the  five  Web  OPACs  have  least  precision  for  subject  expressions  falling  in  range  of  1.01-2.00  covering  3-18%  terms  only  except  DU. The Web  OPACs  of AMU  and  KU  estimate  almost  equal  precision  score  for  15-33%  terms  in  all  ranges.  DU scores highest precision range of 3.01-4.00 for about  78%  terms  and  least  precision  for  about  9%  in  range  of  2.01-3.00  .PU  has  highest    precision  for  about  48%  subjects in range of 3.01-4.00 and least (about 9% terms)  in  range  of  1.01-2.00  in Table  5. 
5.3   m ean  Precision  and mean  Relative  Recall    
 While comparing the mean precision of five University  Web OPACs, it reveals that DU scores the highest mean  precision  (3.23)  followed  by  JNU  (2.97)  and  PU  (2.41)  respectively. AMU obtains (2.29) while KU receives the  lowest  mean  precision  (2.10).  On  the  other  hand, AMU  has highest mean relative recall (0.65), followed by JNU  (0.14)  and  DU  (0.10).  The  Web  OPAC  of  KU  and  PU   maintain  low  recall  (0.03)  each.        
Further,  upon  computing,    the  study  reveals  that  in  all  five  Web  OPACs  get  mean  relative  recall  which  is  much low  compared to mean precision value (Table 6). It  does not exhibit any significant correlation but as usual,  it  demonstrates  that  every  low  Mean  Recall  has  higher  precision but DU OPAC shows the highest precision and   KU  gets  lowest  precision.

6.  COnCLUSIOnS 
The retrieval efficiency of the Web OPACs, in terms  of  relative  recall  and  precision,  is  not  quite  adequate.  The  Relative  recall  is  also  not  satisfactory  for  the  most  of the university OPACs when precision is comparatively  better  with  Delhi  University  OPAC  exhibiting  highest  precision.  Secondly,  as  usual,  the  precision  increases  to  some  degree  with  every  increase  in  recall  value.   Therefore, to achieve more precision and flawless recall,  the professionals of information management and software   management  need to identify shortcomings in the syntax  and  semantics  of  vocabulary  management  and  call  for  increase in the efficiency of knowledge resource handling  approach  through  specific  subject  expressions  by  the  patrons. It seems that Indian professionals do not either  invest  much  in  making  an  appropriate  choice  and  take  less  care  in  selection  of  specific  Subject  Headings  or  rush  data  entry  process  in  the  name  of  automation  and  digitisation without following the right syntax of standard  terms in an adequate manner. Beside, the changing scenario  of  information  seeking  might  have  also  contributed  in  poor performance of retrieval efficiency and hence each  element  or  fragment  demands  more  serious  thought  attention  and  leadership  in  furthering  better  education  and  research  in  this  direction.
