ABSTRACT 
Timely, speedy dissemination of latest information is the benchmark of any information and documentation  center, but utilisation of e-journals is an important factor for its signifcance and cost effectiveness. However, in R&D  community especially for defence R&D, where scientists are involved in core technology areas, value of information  is more important instead of its utilisation. The aim of the study is to fnd out the utilisation of e-journals with cost  effectiveness under Consortium, which was established in the year 2009 for resource sharing among DRDO labs  with least expenses. The data was analysed for the period 2011-2017 to know the current trends of utilisation under  Consortium. Feedbacks and suggestions were collected from all DRDO users to evaluate the importance of information  and its effectiveness. The study shows that productivity of DRDO scientists in publications were increased in high  impact factor journal and majority of scientists preferred e-journals instead of print subscriptions.

1. InTRODUCTIOn 
Defence  Research  and  Development  Organisation  (DRDO) is a premier R&D organisation working in various  areas of military technology. It has 58 laboratories across India  and more than 7000 Scientists are working in multi-disciplinary  subject areas. Each DRDO laboratory has an independent and  well established library and information center called Technical  Information and Resource Center (TIRC) that is also backed  up with strategic information support from Defence Scientifc  Information  and  Documentation  Centre  (DESIDOC),  a  constituent  establishment  of  DRDO.  A  consortium  is  made  for  high  quality,  cost  effective,  sharing  of  resources  and  collaboration of shared goals. Looking at the developments in  national and international scenario and the success of INDEST- AICTE and CSIR-DST consortia in meeting the multifarious  information requirements of their users, it was felt that a similar  effort by DRDO would be benefcial to the R&D community  who need latest information on their desktops. 
DESIDOC  is  a  central  agency  of  all  DRDO  libraries  with  the  mandate  to  provide  latest  scientifc  information  to  DRDO  labs  as  and  when  required,  and  also  responsible  to  make  policies  and  procedures  for  DRDO  libraries.  During  annual Heads of TIRC meet in 2006, it was decided to setup  E-journal  Consortium  for  DRDO  users.  The  DRDO  HQrs  constituted a committee on E-journal Services to DRDO labs  along with Terms of References and to explore the feasibility  to join existing consortia under the chairmanship of Prof. GP  Agrawal, Coordinator of INDEST Consortium IIT Delhi. The

Committee recommended to setup a separate consortium for  DRDO labs keeping-in-view the R&D nature of DRDO and  then in 2009 it was implemented with seven publishers (ACM,  ACS, AIAA, AAAS_Science, IEEE, Jane’s and Elsevier) and  one service provider (JCCC Service). 
2. LITERATURE  R EvIEw 
Moorthy1,  focused  on  initiatives  taken  by  DESIDOC  during implementation of DRDO Consortium, how consortium  may  benefts  the  member  institutions  and  about  the  need  of  establishing National Federation of Library Consortia. Senthil,  and Madhusudhan2  analysed the data for the period from 2009- 2016 in respect of coverage of labs and publishers, year wise  expenditure, and subject wise distribution of journals among  labs. They concluded that DRDO e-journal consortium is one  of the important resource for the scientifc community to carry  out the research. 
Arora  and  Trivedi3   given  detailed  overview  on  UGC- INFONET  consortium  –  associate  membership,  governing  structure, and licensing terms and fair use. They focused that  providing  access  to  e-resources  to  faculties  and  researchers  is  not  a  purpose. The  development  of  stronger  research  and  academic  culture  should  be  triggered  and  optimal  use  of  e-resources is one of the biggest concerns of the consortium. 
Arora5, et  al. analysed  the  research  productivity  of  50  universities  in  frst  phase  by  using  e-resources  through  the  UGC-INFONET Consortium, and found out that more than 75  per cent of research publications were published in past 5 years  i.e. from 2005 to 2009 in comparison to previous block of 5  years i.e. 2000 to 2004.

professionals – Lal6, emphasised the importance of consortia for  sharing of resources, especially for biotechnology institutions  in India. Rogani7, prepared a questionnaire and submitted to  1,350 patrons to know the satisfaction level of users to improve  the information access. Francis8, evaluated the pattern of access  and use of digital resources by the research scholars at Kerala  Agricultural University. 
3. OBJECTIvES OF THE STUDY 
	 To fnd out the cost effective utilisation of e-journals by  
DRDO research community 
	 To know the importance of DRDO e-journal Consortium  
among DRDO community 
	 To  fnd  out  the  growth  of  research  productivity  after  
implementation of e-journal services 
	 Whether users are friendly with consortium or they need  
training in accessing the e-journals 
	 To  fnd  out  highly  used  publishers  and  journals  in  
Consortium. 
4. METHODOLOGY 
The Microsoft excel package was used for analysis and  evaluation of qualitative and quantitative data. The data was  collected from various sources and methods – from publisher’s  website  by  login  facility,  direct  harvesting  using  SUSHI  compliance  reports,  provided  by  publishers  in  excel  format,  downloaded  from  Web  of  Science  (WoS)  database,  and  by  distributing  feedback  proforma  among  DRDO  scientists.  The data analysis was carried out for the period 2012 – 2017,  however productivity of users in published literature were taken  since the year 2000 onwards to know the growth pattern. The  expenditure of e-journals was taken from recorded minutes of  negotiated meeting for their authenticity. The process of data  analysis  involved  sorting,  interpretation,  categorisation  and  calculation. 
5. DATA AnALYSIS 
The data was collected either from publisher’s websites  or  provided  by  publishers.  So  the  authenticity  and  cost  effectiveness  depends  on  publisher’s  trust.  There  is  no  mechanism to fetch real-time usage from any of the publishers.  The  usage  of  e-journals  is  refected  by  the  publishers  after  one or two months, either manually or automatically by using  SUSHI. To  know  the  growth  pattern  of  DRDO  scientists  in  publications, the data was taken from WoS, which covers only  high  impact  factor  journals.  So  actual  productivity  depends  on coverage of WoS. Feedbacks were received from DRDO  users and were analysed to judge the importance of e-journals  at various parameters.  
5.1 Coverage  of  E-journals  under  Consortium  
The subscription of e-journals under DRDO Consortium  is  different  from  other  Consortia  –  E-Shodh  Sindhu  (eSS),  Consortium  for  e-Resources  in  Agriculture  (CeRA),  DBT  e-Library Consortium (DelCON), etc. Usually publisher offers  either full package or bundle of selected titles with cross access  model or minimum unique title list (UTL) access to sites. Such  
424 
types of model (full package or bundle) are suitable for academic  institutions, where students/scholars prefer research in various  discipline.  But  DRDO  scientists  are  developing  technology/ products  for  defence  core  areas,  so  selection  of  periodicals/ journals depends on ongoing projects and are decided on the  basis of the technical aspects of the project. 
Table 1 shows that the access of ACM, IEEE, Jane’s and  NPG were never discontinued, while subscription of Elsevier  and  AIAA  was  discontinued  in  the  year  2016,  due  to  non- acceptance of terms and conditions by publishers. The access  of ACS was discontinued due to in judicious hike in price by  publisher,  while  publisher  had  already  signed  in  2009  for  5  per  cent  escalation  for  multiyear  contract.  The  Science  was  discontinued as they denied for signing on standard document  of request for proposal (RFP) of DESIDOC. 
5.2 Utilisation  of  Publishers  on  the  Basis  of Articles  
viewed 
Total  37.97  lakh  article  were  viewed  during  the  period  from 2012-17 as shown in Table 2, in which approx 50 per  cent i.e. 19.75 lakh articles were viewed in the year 2014 only.  The  trends  of  utilisation  clearly  show  that  in  the  year  2014  the excess of articles were either viewed without knowledge  of perpetual access or because of so many training/ awareness  programmes were arranged in this year. It is very diffcult to  justify  which  publisher  is  number  one  in  the  ranking  or  on  last  position,  because  number  of  titles  are  varying  for  each  publisher.  However  as  per  utilisation,  the  Elsevier  is  in  01  ranking and IEEE is in 02 ranking.  
5.3 Average Cost per Articles during the Period 2012  
–  2017. 
The cost effectiveness of consortium can only be judged  on the basis of number of articles viewed. The publications may  be subscribed or discontinued only on the basis of utilisation.  But sometimes it is very diffcult to take any decision, when  publisher  escalate  price  based  on  the  utilisation.  In  the  year  2009,  DESIDOC  subscribed  American  Chemical  Society  (ACS) for all DRDO labs, but it was discontinued after Dec  2012 due to very high price escalation quoted by ACS, which  was  based  on  utilisation.  However,  average  cost  per  article  of ACS was economical with ranking 1. Subsequently IEEE  ranking 2; Elsevier ranking 3; Jane’s ranking 4; ASME ranking  5; NPG ranking 6; AIAA ranking 7; ACM ranking 8; Science  ranking 9 and Taylor & Francis ranking 10. It is not necessary  that articles subscribed in that year would also be used in the  same year. Due to perpetual accessibility articles may also be  viewed in subsequent years. The Table 3 shows that articles of  IEEE and AIAA were most viewed in 2012; articles of Science,  ASME, Elsevier, Jane’s and NPG were most viewed in 2014,   and articles of ACM were most viewed in 2017. 
It is very diffcult for top management to take decision  to continue the e-journals subscription on previous utilisation,  since  the  utilisation  of  individual  publisher  is  varying  year- wise for example cost per articles of ACM was $ 19.7 in 2013,  while $ 0.3 in 2014 and again $ 22.2 in 2015. The same things  were happened for all the publications except IEEE.

5.4Growth  of  Publications  Output  by  DRDO  
Scientific  Community  after  Implementation  
of  Consortium 
Records  were  downloaded  from  “Web  of  Science” during the period 2000 to 2016 to analyses the  growth of publications output published in high impact  International/National  journals.  Total  4,057  research  articles were published during the period from 2000 to  2008 i.e. per year average rate of publishing the articles  was 450.78 before implementation of Consortium. And  total  7,339  research  articles  were  published  during  the  period  2009  to  2016  i.e.  per  year  average  rate  of  publishing the articles was 917.38 after implementation  the Consortium. There was 50.86 per cent escalation in  publishing of research papers on highly cited international/ national journals.

Figure 2. Level of users 
5.5 Feedback  of  Scientists 
To  evaluate  the  cost  vs  importance  of  e-journals,  a  feedback  proforma  was  distributed to all DRDO scientists by email  and  post.  A  number  of  responses  (212  feedbacks)  were  received  at  DESIDOC  in 2017. The feedback form was designed  mainly  to  know  the  importance  and  utilisation of e-journals among users - how  much  they  are  familiar  with  Consortium,  their  satisfaction  level,  and  to  know  the  most  useful  publications.  The  feedback  proforma  was  designed  in  three  major  parts.  The  part-1  contains  level  of  users,  part-2  contains  responses  of  users  in Yes  or No, while part-3 contains responses of  users  in  the  form  of  multiple  options  as  shown in Table 4. 
Figure 2 indicates that more than 90  per cent of users are aware about e-journals  website.  The  e-journals  are  very  useful  for  project  and  assignments  and  it  was  recognised  by  ≥  92  per  cent  of  scientifc  community.  DRDO  scientists  were  keen  to  access  e-journals  beyond  lab  premises  i.e.  remote  access  (≥  81  %).  The  DRDO  e-journal consortium was implemented in  2009, the trend shows that only ≤ 14 per  cent  of  offcials  prefer  print  journals  that  means  offcials  are  switching  to  adopt  technology. 
As shown in Fig. 3, total 11 responses  were  received  from  category-1;  62  responses were received from category-2;  52  responses  were  received  from

category-3; and 17 responses were received from category-4.  However,  there  were  70  offcials  who  have  not  mentioned  their designations. After analyzing the data, it was found that  offcials in category-2 were more aware (≥ 95 %) about the  e-journals  website,  while  offcials  in  category-3  (≥  96  %)  stated  about  the  importance  of  e-journals  in  their  projects/ assignments.  Majority  of  offcials  in  category-2  were  keen  to  access  e-journals  remotely  (≥  85  %),  while  offcials  in  category-3 (≥ 84 %) did not prefer the print journals. 
Data  shown  in  the  Fig.  4  was  collected  from  various  users in regards of experience, frequency of usages, learning  methods and their satisfaction level. Five per cent users never  used  e-journal,  while  39  per  cent  of  users  were  using  this  
service since more than 4 years. Seventy nine per cent of users  frequently used the e-journals and 55.7 per cent users preferred  access of e-journals within lab campus. As per the feedbacks  more  than  ≥  77.4  per  cent  of  users  satisfed  with  e-journal  services and 94 per cent users wanted to access of e-journals  either for research or knowledge enhancement purpose. Only  10 per cent users wanted awareness/ training from DESIDOC/  publishers.  Overall  e-journal  services  are  highly  useful  for  scientifc community with high level of satisfaction index. 
6. RESULTS/ FInDInGS 
	 Elsevier and IEEE are highly useful publications for all  
DRDO labs while others are useful within clusters only

DJLIT,  VOL.  38,  NO.  6, NOV   2018 
	 Full  package  or  bundle  model  is  most  convenient  for  
DRDO consortium 
	 Utilisation of e-journals in previous years should not be  
the  proper  criteria  for  renewal  of  subscription,  at  least  
average of three years usage should be taken 
	 The average cost per articles is less than the cost of per  
article charged by individual publisher, i.e. subscription  
of e-journals through consortium is economical 	 The  growth  of  research  publication  output  by  DRDO  
scientists was increased upto 50 per cent in highly impact  
factor journals after implementation of DRDO e-journal  
Consortium 
	 Majority  of  scientists  would  like  to  prefer  e-journal  
services and believe that e-journals are important for their  
research project. 
7. COnCLUSIOnS 
E-journals provided latest R&D information to scientifc  community working on their projects. Research study for the  period  2012-17  has  shown  that  utilisation  of  e-journals  is  economical and cost effective. E-journals are great demand with  DRDO scientifc community, further there has been an increase  in research publications of Elsevier and IEEE journals are most  popular with DRDO scientists. R&D organisation like DRDO  which is working in defence core technology areas, cannot be  compared with other Consortia. The productivity in the form  of  research  publication  has  increased  after  implementation  of consortium.  Majority of users prefer e-journals instead of  print subscriptions and have requested for more publications  viz Wiley, Springer, SAG, OSA, etc.
