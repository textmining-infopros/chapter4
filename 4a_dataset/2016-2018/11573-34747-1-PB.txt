The paper examines 9858 global publications output on metamaterials research, as covered in Scopus database  during 2007-16. The study reveals that metamaterials research registered 15.27% growth and averaged citation  impact to 10.08 citations per paper. The global share of top 10 most productive countries in metamaterials research  is 84.97 % and their individual global share ranged from 3.30% to 25.57%. China accounted for the largest global  share (25.71%), followed by USA (23.96%), U.K. (6.06%), India (5.26%), etc. Five of top 10 countries scored  relative citation index above the world average i.e. more than 1: Germany (2.06), USA (1.81), U.K. (1.49), Canada  (1.03) and Spain (1.01). The international collaborative publications share of top 10 most productive countries  varied from 6.14% to 59.80%. Physics and astronomy, among subjects, contributed the largest publication share  (59.36%), followed by engineering (56.71%), materials science (33.30%), computer science (20.32%), mathematics  (6.74%) and chemistry (4.46%). The top 20 most productive organisations and authors together contributed 24.69%  and 13.17% global publications share respectively and 35.72% and 25.96% global citation share respectively. The  top 20 journals accounted for 45.97% share of global output (5743 papers) reported in journals. Of the total global  output on metamaterials research, 52 papers were found as highly cited papers averaging 535.64 citations per paper  in 10 years. These 52 highly cited papers involved the participation of 310 authors and 142 organisations and were  
published in 20 journals.

1. IntroductIon 
Metamaterials are the future materials that can be used to  control and manipulate the fow of light, sound, and generate  such  other  exceptional  properties,  not  found  in  nature  or  in  naturally occurring materials. Metamaterials scientifc activity  is  centred  mainly  on  the  electromagnetic  properties.  Meta- materials gain their exotic and unprecedented electromagnetic  properties  from  their  structure  rather  than  from  their  composition. Metamaterials are not constructed at the chemical  level, as is ordinarily done, but by altering and controlling the  internal physical structure of macro cellsat sub-wavelength level  in a specifed way so that such materials exhibit exceptional  electromagnetic properties that do not exist in nature. Meta- material-enabled  devices  have  a  wide  range  of  applications  in  the  RF,  THz,  IR,  and  visible  spectrum1.  Metamaterial- enabled imaging systems can be integrated with computational  imaging  paradigms2.  Meta-materials  can  be  used  to  develop  new generation, lightweight, high-gain, rapidly reconfgurable  soft-ware defned antennas having potential for applications in  wireless communication, battlefeld communications, cellular  systems and high frequency backhaul, and even enterprise Wi-f

systems communication3. Acoustic metamaterials can be used in  medical ultrasonography, millimeter-precision gesture readers  for human-machine interfaces, and near-range sonars for small  aircraft4. Other astounding advantages of meta-materials include  (but  are  not  limited  to)  negative  index  of  refraction  (where  magnetic and electric response are simultaneously negative),  and  ‘Perfect’  (sub-wavelength)  lensing,  and  electromagnetic  ‘invisibility’ cloaks. Meta-materials hold a huge potential for  developing in the near future three-dimensional optical meta- materials, nonlinear meta-materials and leading research into  ‘quantum’ perspectives of meta-materials1,4.  
Metamaterial  research  being  interdisciplinary  in  nature,  numerous  research  groups  around  the  world  in  particular  in  physics,  optics,  materials,  nano-science,  and/or  electrical  engineering  are  active  in  developing  new  technologies  and  applications in this new and emerging technological discipline  of  meta-materials.  Given  this  context,  it  is  desirable  that  a  bibliometric study is undertaken for understanding publications  and citations trends in metamaterials research at international  level.

metamaterials literature and quite a few on materials research  as a whole and on individual materials. Adams and Pendlebury2 reviewed materials S&T, a core area of research of profound  interest in most economies because of its potential contribution  to  manufacturing  processes  and  innovative  products.  The  authors  examined  the  origin  and  nature  of  the  feld,  then  reviews  its  growth  globally  and  identify  some  key  players  and fnally looks selectively at some of its current diversity in  ‘hot topics’ such as grapheme, metal-organic framework and  nano-fbrous scaffolds used in tissue engineering. Kademani3,  et al.  attempted to highlight quantitatively and qualitatively  the growth and development of world literature on materials  science in terms of publication output and citations as per Web  of  Science  (2006–2010)  database.  The  parameters  studied  include  growth  of  publications  and  citations,  continent- wise  distribution  of  publications  and  citations,  country- wise  distribution  of  publications,  domain-wise  distribution  of  publications  and  citations,  publication  effciency  index,  distribution of publications and citations according to number  of  collaborating  countries,  variation  of  mean  impact  factor  in  materials  science  domains,  identifcation  of  highly  cited  publications and highly preferred journals, quality of research  output  and  application  of  bradford’s  law.  In  this  Indian  context,  Kademani4,  et  al.   analysed  the  materials  science  literature in India for a period of ten years (1999-2008) and  Walke5,  et  al.   and  Gupta 
6,  
et  al  reported  on  the  status  of  materials  science  research  in  India  during  1993-01,  with  metrics on its publication size and growth rate, and discussing  its media of communication, strength and weakness in the areas  of research, quality of research output, nature of collaboration,  and institutional productivity 
Among metamaterials-based research studies, Jovanovic7,  et al.  compared the profles of metamaterials and fullerenes and  looked for typical patterns of the trajectories in the publication  landscape.  Ruihua8   presented  a  bibliometric  analysis  of  metamaterial research from 1998 to 2007, using Thomson Data  Analyzer (TDA) software and sought to describe distribution  of publications output by publication years, countries, subject  categories,  research  institutions,  reporting  journals,  authors  and  the  research  subjects.  Lheurette9   presented  a  brief  history  of  metamaterials  research,  examined  metamaterials  global the growth during 2000-2013 and studied distribution  of  publications  across  research  and  application  felds.  The  other studies in materials science are related to graphene10-11,  nanomaterials12,  rare  materials13,  etc.  reported  trends  across  several different bibliometric indicators.  
2.    o bjectIveS 
The main objective of this study is to study the performance  status  of  metamaterials  research  published  during  2007-16,  based  on  publication  analysis  of  research  output  covered  in  Scopus database. In particular, the study focuses on: (i)  The  growth  of  world  research  output  on  metamaterials  
research, its citation impact and productivity and citation  
impact of top 10 most productive countries; 
(ii)  The  international  collaboration  share  of  top  10  most  
productive countries;  
(iii) The global research output by broad subject areas and the  
dynamics of its growth and decline;  
(iv)  To  identify  signifcant  keywords  in  metamaterials  
research;  
(v) The publication productivity and citation impact of top 20  
most productive organisations and authors;  
(vi)  The modes of research communication, and  
(vii) The characteristics of top 52 highly cited papers.  
3.  MethodoLoGy 
The  data  for  scientometric  study  on  metamaterials  research  was  retrieved  and  downloaded  from  the  Scopus  database  (http://www.scopus.com)  covering  the  10  years  period 2007-16. A search string was formulated by tagging  ‘keyword  tag’  and  ‘Source  Title  tag’  to  the  search  term  ‘metamaterial’.  In  addition  the  search  string  was  refned  by tagging ‘date range tag’ to search period ‘2007-16’. For  the next round of data searching, the said search string was  further refned using analytical commands available in Scopus  database,  by  ‘subject  area  tag’,  ‘country  tag’,  ‘source  title  tag’, ‘journal title name’ and ‘affliation tag’ respectively to  collect data on publications output by subject, collaborating  countries, author-wise, organisation-wise and journal-wise.  The  raw  publications  data  was  analysed  across  a  series  of  raw  and  relative  bibliometric  indicators  with  a  view  to  understand the dynamics of global research in metamaterials.  In  conducting  data  analysis,  we  used  complete  counting  method  wherein  every  contributing  author  or  organisation  covered  in  multiple  authorship  papers  was  fully  counted.  All authors or organisations to multi-authored papers have  received  equal  credit  in  data  counting  and  analysis.  For  impact  factor,  we  used  2015  data.  Citations  to  sourced  publications were collected from date of publication till 17  January 2017.

5.  SuMMAry And concLuSIonS 
Metamaterials are artifcial composite material with exotic  material properties, unprecedented electromagnetic properties  not available from natural materials, and intriguing phenomena  and  applications.  Meta-materials  hold  a  huge  potential  for  developing in the near future three-dimensional optical meta- materials, nonlinear meta-materials and leading research into  ‘quantum’ perspectives of meta-materials.  
This  paper  provides  a  quantitative  and  qualitative  description  of  metamaterials  research  by  analyzing  global  publications data on the subject sourced from Scopus database  covering  10  years  period  during  2007-16.  This  study  fnds  that metamaterials is still a young and growing research feld,  multi-disciplinary  in  nature,  involving  disciplines  such  as  physics  (59.36%),  engineering  (56.71%),  materials  science  (33.30%), computer science (20.32%), mathematics (6.74%)  
326 
and  chemistry  (4.46%).  Its  global  literature  in  10  years  did  not grow as high as expected but it could cumulate its global  output to 9858 publications only with 15.27% growth during  2007-16. 
Currently, the distribution of metamaterials research output  is highly skewed. The top 10 countries in the world account for  the largest 85% global share in metamaterials. China and the  USA are seen the world leaders in metamaterials accounting for  nearly 50% global share whereas other contributing countries  like the UK, India, South Korea, Germany, France, and Japan  are distant cousins, accounting for a small, 3.72% to 6.0% of  the world global share. Of the top 20 most productive global  organisations,  which  account  for  nearly  25.0%  global  share,  15 are from either China or the USA. Metamaterials research  has been found to be a highly collaborative research activity  across  top  10  most  productive  world  countries.  However,  the  UK  accounts  for  the  highest  national  share  in  terms  of  international  collaborative  papers  (59.80%),  followed  by  Germany (52.90%), Spain (51.34%), France (47.97%), Canada  (40.0%),  USA  (33.19%),  Japan  (29.16%),  China  (22.49%),  South Korea (20.70%) and India (6.14%) during 2007-16. This  data demonstrates that research collaboration at national and  international level did play a big role in making breakthroughs  in metamaterials research, technology, and applications. 
both USA and China have emerged as world leaders in  quality of research in metamaterials accounting for 50 of the  top 52 highly cited papers in the feld. These 52 highly cited  papers  together  cumulated  27852  citations  in  10  years,  and  averaged  535.64  citations  per  paper.  These  52  highly  cited  papers appeared in high-impact journals like Physical Review  Letters,  Science,  Nature,  Applied  Physics  Letters,  Nature  Photonics  and   Physical  Review  B ,  Nature  Nanotechnology,  Nano  Letters,  Nature  Materials,  Nature  Communications,  IEEE  Transactions  on  Antennas  &  Propagation,  Nature  Biotechnology,  Journal  of  Physics  D,  Physics-Uppekhi,  Advanced Materials Research, IEEE Antennas & Propagation  Magazine, Journal of Magnetism & Magnetic Materials and  Optical Material Express. Five of the top 10 countries scored  relative citation index above the world average i.e. more than  1:  Germany  (2.06),  USA  (1.81),  U.K.  (1.49),  Canada  (1.03)  and Spain (1.01) during 2007-16.  
In  order  to  further  stimulate  research  and  development  in  metamaterials  for  societal  and  technological  applications,  research collaboration in this feld at national and international  level  is  essential. besides,  such  a  collaborative  approach  to  metamaterials research will help facilitate an effective use of  existing human/equipment resources, and in addition provide  a forum for coordinated research planning, sharing of research  facilities and planning joint project supervision.
