The advancement of science and technology has impacted functioning of the libraries of higher educational  institutions, and the mode of providing resources for various academic activities. For many years, libraries attached  to educational institutions have been labouring with the question of how to determine the value of journals in their  specifc library collection. The Health Sciences Library of Manipal Academy of Higher Education at Manipal,  subscribed a vast number of online journals for their users. A relation between the usage and citations of subscribed  online journals might provide a basis for the collection management in the libraries of academic and research  institutions. The current study resolved to identify whether relationship exists between usage of subscribed online  journals and their citations in the academic publications of the health science professionals from 2010 to 2015. The  study found a statistically signifcant relationship between subscribed online journal usage and their citations in the  publications through the inferential test of Spearman’s rank-order correlation. For collection development of online  journals, libraries can utilise the usage or citation data of journals as a decision making tool.

1. IntROdUCtIOn 
Academic  communities  of  higher  education  are  served  by libraries that play the pivotal role in providing resources  for learning to fulfl the curriculum and research requirements.  The advancement of science and technology has impacted the  libraries  of  higher  educational  institutions,  and  the  mode  of  providing resources for teaching and learning. Online resources  have  become  the  centre  of  every  intellectual  undertaking  in  continuing  education  today.  Compared  to  other  academic  felds,  the  subject  of  health  sciences  developed  rapidly  over  the recent decades. The number of publications in the health  sciences  continue  to  increase,  and  so  does  the  number  of  available publication channels and online journal publishers.  The  libraries  of  health  sciences  institutions  are  providing  online journals that are widely used by the professionals for  academic  activities,  patient  care  and  research  purposes.  For  many years, libraries attached to higher educational institutions  have  laboured  to  determine  the  value  of  a  journal  in  their  specifc library collection. The physical resource collection of  the libraries was measured with circulation fgures and online  resource  collection  through  usage  reports.  Studies  pointed  to  the  usage  reports  of  journals  and  citations  of  journals  as  predictors of online journal usage in libraries that could be used  as valid guides for the selection of these resources1-2. Relation  between the usage and citations of online journals is of interest

as  it  might  provide  a  basis  for  collection  management  in  specifc subject areas in the libraries of academic and research  institutions. The study of relationship of online journal usage  and  their  citations  in  the  publications  can  be  used  as  major  indicators of appropriateness of the online journal collection,  and  to  determine  whether  the  journal  collection  support  the  needs of research activity of the user community3. 
1.1 Literature  Review  
The studies on usage reports of journals and the citations  of journals, as well as the relationship between journal usage  and  citations  of  journals  were  collected  from  literature.  According to Lancaster4  “an electronic journal is one created  for the electronic medium and available only in this medium”.  Further, the electronic journals could be those established in  online networks by publishers after their publication in print.  
The usage reports gave the number of times the research  articles  and  chapters  from  books  were  downloaded  per  unit  time by the user community of an institution. Covey5  found  that usage reports analysis was an unnoticeable way to study  the patterns of use and trends over time, an effective way to  gather long term usage information and a practical way to fnd  difference  between  what  users  say  and  what  they  really  do,  when they use online resources. The study of usage reports of  e-resources  could  also  be  used  for  the  improvement  of  user  interface,  functionality  and  product  training  for  effective  utilisation6. 
Rathemacher7  in his article states that “there are a handful

of small publications purchased individually that provide no  statistics  whatsoever”. usage  reports  (usage  statistics)  could  be collected from the publisher or through the library website  (locally-generated data).  
Londhe & Deshpande8  have shown in their study that usage  reports analysis helped to identify important e-journals for the  user community helpful for proper allocation of funds. Studies  have also given priority for the analysis of the usage reports  because of its value for the decision making in the investment  on library subscribed resources, especially the e-journals that  required long term fnancial commitment9.  
Several  Studies  have demonstrated  that  in  the  internet  age, usage statistics of e-resources was an important device for  measuring the effciency of science and technology libraries10- 11. The application of the usage statistics to assess the e-journals  usage  helped  to  identify  the  actual  usage  and  usefulness  demonstrated in times of renewal/subscription12.  
Davis13  stated that HTML and  pdf downloads combined to  create the full text variable for the journals to comply with the  standards established by the international project counTEr 
pattern,  most  preferred  journals  for  publication  and  highly  cited papers in this method.  
Tsay22 in  a  study  conducted  in  a  medical  library  on  the  relationship of journal usage and citations of journals, showed  a  signifcant  relation  of  usage  of  journals  and  their  citation  frequency;  that  revealed  the  most-used  as  well  as  the  most- cited journals, which are most important. 
A  study  conducted  by blecic23 through  collection  of  journal  usage  data  in  three  ways  :  in-house  use,  circulation  and  citation  by  faculty,  at university  of illinois  probed  the  correlation of these measures in a health sciences library. The  results indicated the importance of carrying out a comparative  study of use of journal by identifying the correlation between  the actual journal usage and citation data. both pearson and  Spearman correlation tests, confrmed the correlation between  the three types of usage data.  
Duy & Vaughan24 in their study pointed to that local citation  data (local to a specifc institution) of an institute or university  gave a meaningful representation of total journal usage. They  assessed whether e-journal usage correlated with citation data,  
(counting online usage of networked Electronic resources). and  found  that  there  existed  a  positive  correlation  of  local  
Citations of a publication gives the bibliographic details  of  journals  cited  in  the  publications  over  a  period  of  time. Though citation checking was time-consuming, it was an in- depth evaluative method to determine usefulness of collection  of libraries supporting education as well as research activity14- 15. Citation checking of scholarly documents and comparison  of those citations against the subscribed materials offered an  unnoticeable method of evaluation of the collection and usage  of subscribed resources16-17.  
According  to bergstrom18   librarians  could  use  the  data  on  citation  counts  to  select  appropriate  journals  for  library  collections.  Citation  analysis  of  journals  was  important  for  evaluating research articles, researchers, journals, departments,  and subject felds19. 
Study  conducted  by gao20  recommended  the  usage  
citation  with  the  e-journal  usage.  The  study  by  McDonald25  found  online  journal  usage  reports  gathered  locally,  for  the  previous year was a helpful model with predictive potential for  future citations.

The study was limited to the online subscribed journals of  the Health Sciences Library for the period from 2010 to  2015 
The online journals selected for collecting usage reports  were  restricted  to  those  publishers  from  whom  fve  or  more journals were subscribed by the library 
Citation  analysis  was  limited  to  the  Scopus  citation  database 
6. ReSeARCH  Met HOdOLOgy 
The study adopted quantitative research methodology for  collecting data. The details of subscribed online journals’ titles  were collected publisher-wise, from the year 2010 to year 2015  through the EasyLib automation software of the library. Then  the following research methods were adopted for collecting the  data for assessing utilisation of subscribed online journals:  • Collection  of  the  usage  reports  of  subscribed  online  
journals from the publishers, and 
• Collection of citations of subscribed online journals from  
the publications of the health science professionals using  
Scopus citation database 
2010 to 2015. Full text usage is defned as the combination  of HTML and pdf downloads. The full text downloads were  collected to determine the extent of usage of each subscribed  online journal selected for the study. 
6.2 Collection  of  Citation  Counts  of  Online  
Journals  Using  Scopus  Citation database    
The  subscribed  online  journals  for  which  usage  reports  obtained  were  considered  (11  publishers  of  journals)  for  citation  checking  in  the  publications  of  the  health  science  professionals.  The  documents  published  by  the  fve  health  sciences institution of MAHE, Manipal were retrieved year- wise, through ‘affliation search’ of Scopus citation database for  the period from 2010 to 2015 using the following keywords:  • Kasturba Medical College, Manipal 
• Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Manipal • Manipal College of Nursing, Manipal 
• Manipal College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Manipal • Allied Health Sciences, Manipal  
The citation details of all types of documents published  in Scopus viz., articles, conference papers, conference reviews,  notes,  letters,  reviews  and  short  surveys  were  collected  year-wise  for  the  analysis.  After  retrieving  the  publications  institution-wise, references appended to the publications of the  health science professionals were screened manually to record  the number of citations obtained by subscribed online journals  of the library26. For this, online journals selected for the study  were arranged alphabetically (year-wise) in an excel sheet for  recording the journal citations. The number of publications and  citations of each year of the study were checked till the date of  30th  August 2016.

The usage reports of journals and the citations obtained by  the subscribed journals in the publications of the health science  professionals  were  analysed  using  excel  spread  sheet.  The  relationship  between  the  two  variable  were  determined  with  Spearman’s  rank-order  correlation  test  using  the  Statistical  package  for  Social  Sciences  (SpSS  version  16.0),  currently  known as predictive Analytics Software (pASw).

Online  Journals 
The  usage  reports  of  the  subscribed  online  journals  of  the Health Sciences Library were collected directly from the  journal publishers. The study identifed 11 publisher of journals  from whom fve or more than 5 journal were subscribed by the  library from 2010 to 2015. The study retrieved usage reports  from the journal publishers viz.,  American Medical Association  (AMA), bMJ,  Elsevier  Science,  Karger,  Lippincott, nature,  oxford university press, Sage, Springer, Taylor & Francis and  wiley. usage reports of online journals were collected monthly  from January to December, in an Excel spreadsheet. The yearly  usage data of each journal was thus collected and analysed from

whom 5 or more than 5 journal were subscribed by the library.  usage  reports  of  journals  of  a  few  publishers  couldn’t  be  collected due to the change in name of publishers or publishing  platforms, change of name of journals and change in interface  due  to  new  technology  adopted  by  the  publishers  in  the  website. Table  also  shows  that  the  usage  reports  of  journals  were available from fve of the publishers in the year 2010.  From the years 2011 to 2013, usage reports of journals from  8 publisher each, were procured and for the year 2014, from  9 publisher. For the year 2015 usage reports of majority of the  journals from the publishers were procured for the study.

7.4  Relationship  between  Usages  of      Subscribed  Online  Journals  and  their  Citations  in  the  Publications  of  the  Health  Science  Professionals 
The  subscribed  online  journals  for  which  both  the  usage  reports  (Table  2:  nSJuc)  and  citations  of  journals  were  collected  (Table  5:  nSJc), was analysed to see whether a relationship  existed between the two variable (full text usage  and citations) from the year 2010 to 2015. Table  6 provides the number of journals for which the  usage  and  citations  were  collected  with  mean  and Standard Deviation. The two variables were  not  normally  distributed  as  shown  (Table  6).  Therefore, Spearman’s rank-order correlation test  was used to check whether there is a relationship  between the two variables that were not normally  distributed. The Spearman correlation coeffcient,  ρ (“rho”), when ‘0’, signifes that the ranks of one  variable  do  not  co-vary  with  ranks  of  the  other  variable27. 
Figure 1 depicts the Spearman’s rank-order  correlation  and  the  number  of  journals  used/ cited (in parenthesis) for each year from 2010 to  2015. A  trend  was  observed,  though  uneven,  of  increased correlation for the number of journals  citations  with  the  increasing  usage  of  journals  every  year  from  2010  to  2015.  The  values  of  Spearman’s  rank-order  correlation  (ρ)  indicated  the  highest  positive  correlation  (0.547)  for  313  journal  during  the  year  2015  and  the  lowest  in  the year 2010 as shown in the Fig. 1. The average  usage of journals (335.05 ± 556.28) and average  citations obtained (5.19 ± 9.48) were the least in  the year 2010 as shown in Table 6 compared to  other years and revealed the lowest correlation of  0.246 (Fig. 1).

The  fndings  of  the  full  text  usage  and  the  citations  of  journals demonstrated the extent of utilisation as well as usage  and citations of journals from the different publishers in the  academic publications of the health science professionals.

The  percentage  of  subscribed  journals  for  which  usage  reports were collected were the highest in the year 2015  (99.68 %), followed by 90.50 per cent in 2014, 88.34 per  cent in 2012, 87.36 per cent in 2011, 84.25 per cent in  2013 and 76.72 per cent in 2010.  
It was found that due to the different modes of access to  the subscribed online resources of the library provided for  the users, the library had to depend on the publishers of  the journals for collection of the usage reports. The  usage  reports  of  online  journals  showed  that  the  full  text  usage  (Html+pdf  downloads)  was  the  highest  during 2015 with 130461 download, followed by 123995  download  in  2012,  121663  download  in  2014,  109753  download in 2013, 103918 download in 2011 and 89460  download in 2010.      
The study found that the highest number of citation (2558  times) were obtained in the publication of health science  professionals by the subscribed online journals in the year  2015, followed by 2325 citation in 2011, 1929 citation in  2014, 1852 citation in 2013, 1856 citation in 2012 and

The  journals  for  which  the  average  full  text  usage  and  citations collected to study the relationship, showed that  the highest average usage (416.81 ± 685.05) and average  citations (8.17 ± 11.67) of subscribed journals was noted  for the journals for the year 2015 (Table 4). However, a  trend  (uneven)  of  increased  correlation  for  the  number  of journal citations with the increasing usage of journals  every year from 2010 to 2015 was observed (Fig. 1). A  statistically  signifcant  relationship  was  found  in  the  study  between  the  two  variables  -  usage  of  subscribed  journals  and  citations  of  journals  in  the  publications.  The ‘ρ’ (rho) value indicated a relationship between the  usage  of  subscribed  journals  and  their  citations  in  the  publications of the health science professionals.  The  results  of  Spearman’s  rank-order  correlation  test  indicated  the  highest  positive  correlation  (ρ=  0.547)  for  313  journal  during  the  year  2015,  followed  by  305  subscribed journal (ρ= 0.516) during the year 2014 and  304 journal (ρ= 0.446) during the year 2011 (Fig. 2).  
 9.   dISCUSSIO n 
Relationship  between  the  usage  of  subscribed  online  journals and their citations in the academic publications of the  user community have been few and far between, in the literature  reviewed.  It  is  an  unnoticeable  method  of  intervention  to  determine the usage of subscribed online resources by the users  of the library. This relationship could be taken as an indicator  for the utilisation of journals as well as the appropriateness and  relevance of the journal collection of the library. The collection  of the usage reports of online journals is publisher driven and  collecting accurate usage statistics is a demanding task. based  on these fndings, suggestions are proposed. 
10.  SUggeStIOnS 
Suggestions based in the fndings are as follows: • Regular monitoring of the usage reports of online journals  
and  their  citations  that  can  be  a  useful  instrument  for  
making  decisions  suitable  for  increasing  the  usage  of  
online journals.    
• Development  of  a  software  package  for  recording

and  compiling  the  usage  reports  of  online  subscribed  electronic  information  resources  to  enable  libraries  to  independently generate the usage information from all the  access points.  
11.  COnCLUSIOnS 
The relationship between the usage of subscribed online  journals and their citations in the publications provided evidence  for the journal usage, indicating its value for determining the  suitability of the library collection. The investigation signifed  that the study of usage reports of online journals was a helpful  model with predictive potential for the citations of the journals  in the future. It was also evident that the citation analysis of  journals is time consuming. A period of nearly two years was  required for a published article to be read, and for it to become  a part of an author’s research and cited eventually. However,  either  the  full  text  usage  or  citations  of  journals  can  be  a  useful indicator for the appropriateness of journal subscription  and  decision  making.  The  study  is  patterned  for  helping  in  the building up of a relevant online journal collection in the  library.
