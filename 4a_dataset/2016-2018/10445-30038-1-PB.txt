1. IntrOduCtIOn 
The academic library of any institutions is well known  as  the  center  point  of  knowledge  and  have  always  been  updated with latest technology. However, these libraries  are using current trends and technology to expand service  more  user  friendly.  Library  3.0,  social  media,  etc.,  are  the  buzz  words  these  days.  Everyone  now  discussing  about  its  application  and  utilising  this  service  in  their  day  to  day  activities.  Librarians  are  always  interacting  with  users  and  other  professionals.  The  main  aim  of  the  librarian  is  to  share  information.  With  the  impact  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  the same activity of the libraries being done with social  media.  Librarians  are  now  targets  graduate  students  as  they  much  tech  savvy  in  social  media. 
Social media tools are very attractive, permits users to  share information, communicate among the professionals,  build  relationship,  share  picture,  video,  etc.  There  are  different types of social media tools available for different  functionality of the library, i.e., information, communication,  information archiving and dissemination and knowledge  organisation in an academic library. Facebook, Linkdin,  Mebo,  Myspace,  WhatsApp,  Twitter,  etc.,  are  the  most  useful tools for information communication. SlideShare,  Research  Gate,  Academi.edu,  YouTube  are  the  best  medium  to  disseminate  information  to  the  end  user.  Similarly  Mendeley,  Zotero,  aNobi,  Communitywalk,  GoogleScholar,  etc.,  is  the  suitable  tools  for  organing  knowledge  of  the  academic  library.  The  present  paper  investigates the most used social media tools by academic  library  for  the  above  three  functionalities  of  the  library  of  selected  region. 
The  application  of  social  media  mushrooming  day  by  day,  allow  users  access  to  precise  information  through  varieties  of  resources.  Social  media  tools  is  a

There  are  different  kinds  of  social  media  available,  i.e.,  Microbloging,  fourms,  social  networking,  social  bookmarking,  social  curation  and  wikis,  etc.  In  academic  libraries,  librarian  can  use  these  social  media  applications  in  three  board  ranges  of  activities  like  
(a) Information  communication  
(b) Information  distribution  and  
(c) Knowledge  organisation

Bryer  &  Zavatarro1   defined  in  their  paper  ‘Social  Media  are  technologies  that  give  opportunity  for  social  interaction,  make  possible  collaboration  and  enable  deliberation across stakeholders’. Boyd & Ellison2  stated  that  social  networking  websites  allow  individuals  with  whom  they  share  a  connection,  and  view  and  traverse  their list of connections and those made by others within  the system. Bradely & McDonald3, defined social media  encompasses  any  internet  based  or  mobile  application  which  operates  for  the  purpose  of  collaboration,  where  participants  can  connect,  create,  comment,  view  share,  rate,  discover,  profile  and  exchange  user  generated  content.  Kaplan  &  Haenlein4,  defined  social  media  as  “a  group  of  internet-based  applications  that  build  on  the  ideological  and  technological  foundations  of  Web  2.0, and that allows the creation and exchange of user- generated  content”. 
Smith & Linder5, stated wikis, blogs, chat rooms, instant  messengers, message boards and social bookmarking are

technology applications that have been used to facilitate  member  interaction,  and  thus  have  been  referred  to  as  social  networking  tools.  Wallace  &  Paul6,  mentioned  ‘Students working on a highly collaborative project used  social  networking  technology  for  community  building • activities as well as basic project-related communication.  requiring  students  to  work  on  cross-program  projects  give  them  real-world  experience  working  in  diverse, • geographically dispersed groups”. Vasquez & Bastidas7,  conducted an exploratory inductive comparative study of  the  services  and  tools  of  a  select  set  of aSNSs.’  They  argue that maintaining multiple profiles might be time- consuming and propose starting a discussion about how  they  can  make  this  process  less  cumbersome.

  explored  the  factors  influencing  the  acceptability  and  effectiveness  of  using  Web  2.0  social  networking tools as an aid to learning. Topper9  found that  libraries will have to reach users in their preferred methods  of communication. Salz10   discussed  about  the  impact  of  
specific  objectives  are  to: 
• Understand how the library promotes services (library  
events,  new  acquisition,  SDI  service,  CAS,  CS,  
etc.) 
Acknowledge how to promote information literacy and  
library  engage  users  with  the  academic  community 
Know  how  the  library  connects  easily  with  the  
potential  user 
• Explore  respondent’s  attitude  towards  the  use  of

Social media plays very important role in library in  current environment. It bridges the gap between the users  and  librarian  to  provide  and  share  valuable  information  using varieties of its tools. The current survey is confined  to the librarians of selected engineering colleges, affiliated  
online  collaboration  and  social  networking  that  connect  
to  BPUT,  Odisha.  Online  questionnaires  were  sent  to  people  based  on  their  knowledge  and  talents  to  initiate  
the  librarians  to  know  about  their  uses  of  social  media  
tools, and to acknowledge the best social media used by  
innovation, and accelerate career prospects, on organisations.  Gunawardena11   proposed  a  theoretical  framework  as  a  foundation  for  building  online  communities  of  practice

5.1.4 SMT  to  Provide  Customer  Services 
Customer  service  in  terms  of  library  is  the  process  of  ensuring  user  satisfaction  with  product  or  service.  Generally, customer service happens while any transaction  for  the  customer  is  performed  in  the  library,  i.e.,  book  issue  or  book  return.  Earlier  customer  service  were  performed  in  the  form  of  telephone,  person  interaction.  With  the  advent  of  social  media  now  it  is  becoming  easier  to  performing  such  activities  in  library  through  social  media  tools.  
Table  4  revealed  that  to  provide  customer  services,  i.e.,  (complaint,  suggestions,  inquiries,  feedback,  etc. Whatsapp, (31.3 %), Blog (22.99 %), Twitter (17.24 %)  and Facebook (16.9 %) were most used social media tools  by  librarians  to  provide  customer  service. Though  there  were other tools, which are used less than 15 %, Myspace  (8.05  %),  LinkedIn  (3.45  %)  and  other  (1.15  %).

Knowledge organisation in libraries helps to organise  the  library  resource  systematically.  It  is  an  activity,  which  librarian  performs  like  classification,  indexing,  document  description,  etc.,  inside  the  library.  In  the  current  environment  almost  all  the  library  activities  is

the respondents were using social media tools to satisfy  the end users. Youtube and Wikipedia are the most used  tools  to  collect,  use  full  library  information.

Knowledge is a central hub of any organisation and  well  managed  knowledge  leads  the  organisation  into  great  heights.  In  the  library  environment  knowledge  organisation  manages  the  information,  i.e.,  catalogue,  classify,  engage  the  research  community,  etc.  In  this  
regards,  all  responded  were  used  different  social  media  tools, i.e., aNobi , GoogleScholar and Mandeley emerges  as most used SMT for book reviews, engage the research  community  and  bibliography  management  respectively.  
7.  COnCLuSIOnS 
Social media tools are utilised by libraries to convey  a  mix  of  user  service,  news  and  upgrades,  content/ endorsement of collection, dissemination of the organisations'  intellectual, procurement of educational tools and assets  and  for  building  connections  both  inside  and  outside  of  the institution. Verities of online networking channels are  utilised,  however,  so  far  there  is  constrained  separation  between  how  they  are  utilised.  Facebook  and  Twitter  stay predominant, however visual channels, for example,  YouTube  and  Pinterest  are  quickly  on  the  ascent.  We  foresee that sooner rather than later more tools particular  techniques  will  develop. 
While there is a drive for librarians to utilise social  media tools inside the library setting, it has been recognised  this  is  still  a  developing  process  with  many  library  professionals trying different things with what works or  not,  and  how  it  can  advantage  the  library.  More  broad  publicly  accessible  studies  are  expected  to  show  how  fruitful  libraries  are  getting  along  this  and  how  they  are  measuring  their  triumphs.  Identifying  with  this,  a  usually concurred structure of the appraisal is additionally  required,  so  libraries  can  start  to  benchmark  the  effect  of  their  exercises  against  a  scope  of  destinations. 
Obviously, while the complexity of social media tools  utilised and the frequency of upgrades are important issues  in introducing a solid online presence, many professional  are  agreed  that  it  is  somewhat  the  quality  and  sort  of  content  posted,  the  characterised  objectives  and  plans,  and an arrangement of the necessities and desires of the  library  users  that  leads  to  fruitful  rendezvous.
