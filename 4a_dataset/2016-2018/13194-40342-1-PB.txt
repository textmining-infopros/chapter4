ABSTRACT 
The study presents the scientometric profle of Sant Gadge Baba Amravati University (SGBAU), Amravati during  1996-2017. The required research output for the study has been pulled out from SCOPUS database on the basis of  affliation based search. The complete research output is 1130 with 10.65 per cent average citations per paper. 83.98  per cent papers were published during the year 2007 to 2017 which is highly productive block compared to 16.02  per cent research output during 1996 to 2006.  The highest H-index (17) was found in the year 2009. 20.08 per  cent documents were produced though international collaboration. SGBAU, Amravati has the largest collaboration  with Brazil (69) and United States (21). Authorship pattern predicts collaborative trend. Maximum 370 papers were  written by two author, however research papers produced with three author have got the maximum 4444 citations  for their 315 paper. Collaborative authorship pattern has received maximum citations (89.17 %). Average degree of  collaboration is 0.96 while the average modifed collaborative coeffcient is 0.6289. 839 Journal and 174 Conference  papers are the most popular source types preferred by the faculty of SGBAU for research expression. Mahendra  Rai (209), S. K. Omnwar (143) and Anand S. Aswar (94) are the most prolifc authors. It is noteworthy that Alka  P. Yadav has got 3073 citations for her 17 paper. Most of the articles are published in the domain of Physics and  Astronomy (356) followed by Engineering, Chemistry, Material Science, Biochemistry-Genetics-Molecular Biology  and Computer Science. With regard to institutional collaboration, the faculty members of the SGBAU have confned  themselves to the Maharashtra state most of the time.

1. INTRODUCTON 
Universities have to play a key role in imparting quality  education  and  promoting  research  activities  through  its  educational departments. This is important not only to develop  particular subject feld but also to quench scientifc thirst of  creative peoples who are mostly the academicians. It ultimately  results  in  adding  more  knowledge,  understanding  particular  phenomena, accelerating the business and scientifc decision  making. Scientometric is a very popular method to study the  quantitative aspect of the research productivity and the same  method  has  been  adopted  to  study  research  output  of  Sant  Gadge Baba Amravati University (SGBAU), Amravati. 
The  Sant  Gadge  Baba  Amravati  University  (SGBAU),  Amravati  is  established  on  1st   May,  1983,  the  auspicious  Maharashtra Day and Worker’s Day. This University graphically  covers the western Vidarbha belt (i.e. fve districts- Amravati,  Akola, Yawatmal, Buldhana and Washim) of Maharashtra state.  The University in its small span of two decades has contributed  in many ways for economic, social and cultural upliftment of  the society by offering quality education. The university has 10

The  research  output  of  the  SGBAU  faculty  members  required for the present study was extracted from the SCOPUS  database.  Though  the  university  is  established  in  1983,  the  publications from 1996 are available in the SCOPUS. Hence  the publication output from 1996 to 2017 has been considered  for the study. In order to get appropriate data, the affliation  based  search  with  the  tag  ‘Sant  Gadge  Baba  Amravati  University Amravati’ was made which resulted in availability  of 1161 document. The affliation city was ‘Amravati’. In order  to eliminate the documents of 2018 from the search, the search  was limited to the year 2017, which gave the output of 1130  documents.  The  same  data  was  fltered  for  ‘Year’,  ‘Author  name’,  ‘Subject  Area’,  ‘Document  type’  and  ‘Affliation’  based search to get the results for the concerning parameters.  The Output of 1130 was exported as ‘Microsoft Offce Excel  Comma Separated Value file’ for getting appropriate results  about authorship pattern and citation received for each pattern.  The data of 1130 record were also used as an input to VOSviewer  for  data  visualisation  of  international  collaborations,  co- authorship network and co-occurrence of keyword.

The complete research output as shown in Table 1 of Sant  Gadge  Baba  Amravati  University,  Amravati  is  1130  during  1996 to 2017. During 1996 to 2006, 16.02 per cent paper were  produced while 83.98 per cent document were published during  2007  to  2017  which  can  be  regarded  as  highly  productive  block. The average citation per paper for publication is  10.65 per cent which scaled up 8.79 per cent to 11 per  cent from 1996-2006 to 2007-2017. There seems the  growth in publication output which ultimately resulted  in the growth of total citation received. The year 2009  is  remarkable  in  that  3825  (31.77  %)  citation  were  received in one year. H-index (17) is also high in this  year followed by15 in 2014 and 2015, 14 in 2007 and  2013. The  years  from  2013  to  2017  have  been  very  productive  with  regard  to  international  collaborative  publication  as  40,  44,  31,  24,  34  paper  have  been  published consecutively during these years. 20.08 per  cent documents were published through international  collaboration.  The  increase  in  internationally  collaborative  papers  is  promoting  growth  to  overall  research output. However, the proportion is low when  
measured up by and large.

5.8 Collaborative  Institutes  and  Organisations 
Table 7 throws light on top 15 institutional collaborators  of  SGBAU,  Amravati  within  the  India.  The  Rashtrasant  Tukadoji  Maharaj nagpur  University, nagpur  has  been  top  most collaborators for SGBAU and stands at the frst position  with 61 collaboration. Shri Shivaji Science College, Amravati  is at the second position with 37 document followed by Dr.  Babasaheb  Ambedkar  Marathwada  University,  Aurangabad  and  Millia  Arts,  Beed  are  at  the  third  and  fourth  position  respectively.  National  Environmental  Engineering  Research  Institute,  Nagpur,  Hislop  College,  Nagpur  and  prof.  Ram  Meghe College of Engineering and Technology are at the ffth,  sixth and seventh position consecutively.  The important feature  of this institutional collaboration is that all these leading 15  institution are from Maharashtra and maximum 7 institution  are from Nagpur city. It is surprising that there is hardly other  state which could get place in the above chart.  faculty member  seem to choose co-researcher from the Maharashtra state only.  
5.9 Co-occurrence  of  Keyword 
figure 3 shows co-occurrence of keywords with greatest  total links strength based on full counting method given in the  VOSviewer.  The  criteria  of  the  keywords  having  appeared  fve  times  or  more  than  fve  times  have  been  selected.  Out  of 8441 keyword, 635 met the threshold. Out of 635, leading  50  keyword  were  chosen.  Insignifcant  keywords,  such  as  article,  nonhuman  were  eliminated.  The  keywords  most  frequently  occurred  and  having  more  links  keywords  are

Besides  these  keywords  are  followed  by  anti  ineffective agent, metal nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles,  and  synthesis  (chemical)  pseudomonas  aeruginosa  and  transmission electron microscopy. These keywords throws  light on the research areas in which faculty members are  engaged with.  
6. CONCLUSIONS 
The scientometric profle of SGBAU, Amravati gives  an idea that the research output has been increasing each  year. However, this output is lopsided as the most prolifc  authors and scientifc expression by them are from science  domain only. The university has post graduate departments  in  social  sciences  and  humanities. Their  share  must  also  be refected in scientifc productivity. Hence the university  needs  to  design  some  policy  to  improve  the  research  writing  in  the  feld  of  social  science  and  in  the  areas  where  research  activities  are  lagging  behind.  Although  collaborative research is increasing, yet the collaboration  should  be  extended  beyond  Maharashtra  state  because  research  collaboration  at  national  and  international  level  leads to publication in mainstream and core journals 
6. The  study is limited in that the results are not compared with  other state universities or other epoch making institutions  so  as  to  have  a  perfect  view  of  scientifc  productivity  or  profle  comparison  of  the  university.  further  data  
generated  through  SCOPUS  has  its  own  
limitations. The  Scopus  does  not  take  into  
account  publications  in  regional  languages  
and  many  other  national  journals  which  
have  been  selected  by  the  faculty  member  
for  research  expression.  Inspite  of  this  the  
present  scientometric  study  keeps  special  
signifcance  as  it  offers  an  opportunity  for  
introspection  about  the  research  output  of  
the  university  and  frame  better  policy  for  
better performance in the future.
