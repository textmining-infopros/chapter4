The study fnds out the level of awareness and use of online databases by the post graduate (PG) students and  their satisfaction level with the infrastructure to support accessing online databases in the Central Science Library  (CSL). A well structured questionnaire was prepared and distributed to the PG students to carry out the study  and analyses the data regarding the awareness and use of online databases. The survey shows that most of them  are well aware of the online databases and largely use them for their research work and to update their subject  knowledge. It is also found that the main problems faced by them in using online databases are lack of information  on online databases subscribed by university on their subjects/researches. It is also noticed that nearly 80 % of  users are satisfed with the infrastructure that support accessing online databases in the Central Science Library.

1.  INtrODUCtION 
In  the  present  era,  libraries  in  India  are  moving  towards  use  of  computers  and  related  technology  to  improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the information  services.  Information  in  digital  content  makes  easier  for  teachers  and  students  to  access  information  anytime  and  anywhere.  Information  has  become  a  necessity  for  everyone,  and  everybody  needs  information  for  some  or  other  purpose.  
A database is a computerised collection of logically  related  set  of  data  or  records  about  something  that  are  stored  and  organised  in  the  computer.  The  researchers,  especially  in  the  field  of  science  and  technology,  need  information  on  continuing  basis  and  are  considered  the  biggest  users  of  information.Therefore,  most  of  the  information  systems  and  services  have  been  developed  in academic institutions and universities to satisfy these  requirements  of  the  researchers. 
An  online  database  search  is  simply  bibliographic  research which is performed by an individual scholar or  librarian using a computer and the internet. By connecting  with a database research service, millions of records from  thousands  of  publications  in  hundreds  of  databases  can  be  searched  for  material  on  a  topic. 
An  online  database  is  a  database  accessible  from  a  network,  including  from  the  internet.  It  differs  from  
• They  are  often  purchased  by  a  monthly  
subscription 
• They embed common collaboration features such as  
sharing,  e-mail  notifications,  etc. 
Some examples of online databases are: (a) Web of  Science;  (b)  EBSCO;  (c)  Science  Direct;  (d)  Springer  Link;  (e) ABI/INFORM;  and  (f)  Scopus.

The  emergence  of  Central  Science  Library  (CSL)  dates back to 1981. Prior to that, it was a part of Central  Reference  Library  (CRL),  Delhi.  However,  the  need  to  have  a  separate  science  library  was  shown  much  earlier  by  Carl  M.  White  in  1966  who  recommended  that,  ‘a  Science Library be created to serve the departments, which  consist of Faculty of Science and that the collection now  maintained  by  these  departments  and  related  material  in  the  main  library  be  used  to  form  the  nucleus  of  the  new  library.  A  science  librarian  of  outstanding  ability  be  employed  to  take  charge  of  it  and  that  a  new  building  be  erected  to  house  the  library’.  With  the  growth  of  the  University,  the  membership  of  Central  Library  kept  on  increasing,  as  a  result  in  due  course  of  time  with  increasing  membership  and  their  changing  information  needs,  it  became  inconvenient  for  Central  Library  to  serve  the  users,  belonging  to  the  faculty  of  
a  local  database,  held  in  an  individual  computer  or  its  science  effectively.  The  three-storied  building  having  a  attached  storage,  such  as  a  CD.  Currently,  there  are  carpet  area  of  22,595  sq.  feet  with  a  sitting  capacity  several database products designed specifically as hosted  of  185  seats  started  functioning  independently  with  
databases,  delivered  as  software  as  a  service,  products.  Some  of  the  differences  are: 
• The  online  databases  are  delivered  primarily  via  a  
web  browser 
effect  from  8 April  1981.  The  administration  of  CSL  is  under  the  Dean  of  the  faculty  of  science.  The  library  has  internet  access  facility  and  is  available  to  science  stream  clientele  only.  All  internet  services  like  e-mail,

browsing,  and  downloading  are  open  to  them.  In  some  cases  printouts  of  articles  are  also  provided.  Presently  ,more  then  90  databases  and  28074  online  journals  from  various  publishers  are  available  through  IAF.  A  list of such online journals is on CSL website at http:// csl.du.ac.in,  www.du.ac.in.  The  CSL  library  has  90  personal computers installed. The library is using Troodon  software.  Prior  to  Troodon,  the  CDS/ISIS  software  was  used in acquisition and cataloguing functions. The CSL  is  actively  engaged  in  rendering  e-resource  availability  through  http://csl.du.ac.in. 
The  CSL  provides  e-mail  services  to  the  users  informing them about latest additions and e-alert services.  
manual  sources  still  have  some  qualities  which  make  these valuable. The study recommended that the databases  should  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  compromise  between  high  recall  and  high  precision,  and  ultimately  between  both  of  these  and  the  cost. 
Khan  &  Zaidi6   endeavours  to  find  out  the  level  of  awareness  and  use  of  online  databases  as  well  as  to  ascertain  research  scholar’s  satisfaction  with  the  infrastructure  to  support  accessing  online  databases  in  the AMU. Roy, Shailendra Kumar & Satija7  investigated  and  determined  the  different  challenges  faced  by  the  searchers of online database in selected central university  libraries in India.

The  CSL  provide  online  database  to  its  user  to  support teaching, research, and development. The literature  
advances  in  telecommunication,  development  of  faster  and  more  powerful  computers,  and  the  improvements  in  user-friendly  software.  The  study  suggests  that  the  library  users  know  how  to  search  and  learn  critical  
thinking skills for databases and keyword selection. Falk9 show  s  that  online  databases  with  their  retrieval  due  to

Today’s  everyone  is  talking  about  e-learning,  in  which  all  the  documents  are  available  in  e-form.  The  
reading of scholarly articles has been increased. A growing  
reasons  to  evaluate  the  databases  are  to: 
proportion  of  these  readings  come  from  e-prints.  Most  scientists in a discipline now use e-journals at least part  of the time with considerable variations among discipline.

9.  CONCLUSIONS 
The evaluation of online databases is done from users  
It was analysed that 98.61 % users were satisfied with  
the Science Direct’s user interface. All are satisfied from  
point of view and it is found that users are much aware  the Springer Link. About 84 % users were satisfied  with  
about the online databases like Science Direct, Springer  Web of Science; 83.33 % from Scopus and 86.11 % from  
Link,  Web  of  Science,  IEEE  xplore,  ABI/INFORM,  IEEE Xplore. About 81.94 %,  80.55 % and 80.55 % were  
EBSCO, etc., and also are aware of searching techniques  satisfied  with  EBSCO,  Mathscinet,  and  ABI/INFORM,  
to  certain  extent  which  will  lead  to  the  qualititative  
respectively. 
7.  FINDINGS 
work and mostly users used the online database for their  research work in the central library or departmental lab.  The  Science  Direct  is  found  as  the  best  database  from  
The  present  study  reveals  the  very  specific  trends  
all  kind  of  perspective. in  the  use  of  different  online  databases  in  the  CSL.  
Depending  upon  the  analysis  of  the  data  acquired  by  
reFereNCeS 
conducting  user  survey,  the  following  are  the  findings: (a) Data  analysis  shows  that  41.6  %  of  post  graduate  
students  uses  the  online  databases  on  daily  basis  
whereas  34  %  use  the  databases  weekly  basis. (b) The  most  used  databases  by  post  graduate  students  
members (97.22 %) of CSL is Science Direct followed  
by  Springer  Link  (95.83  %)  while  there  are  many  
other  databases  also  in  the  library. 
(c) About  90  %  users  use  phrase  search  technique  and  
87.5 % of users use simple search method followed  
by keyword searching method (84.72 %). This shows  
that  the  users  are  well  aware  of  various  searching  
techniques. 
(d) About  97  %  users  have  found  relevant  information  
in  Web  of  Science  and  95.4  %  users  found  ABI/ 
INFORM  as  their  relevant  source  of  infomation.  
More  than  80  %  users  found  relevant  information  
on  all  the  online  databases. 
(e) Users are much aware about the archival collection and  
ranking  facility  of  journals  in  online  databases.

7. 
suggestions can be made to improve the usage of different  
databases  available  in  the  CSL. 
(a) To  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  post  graduate  
scholars  towards  access  of  databases,  the  library  
8. 
should provides hands on experience and conduct user  9. 
orientation  programmes  to  post  graduate  students. (b) For most effective searching of databases, there is need  
to provide training about how to use advance search  
techniques  for  getting  most  relevant  results. (c) Students are needed to make aware about various other  
online  databases  which  are  procured  by  CSL. (d) A user survey is to be condeucted at definite intervals  
so  that  library  staff  can  know  about  the  searching  
strength  in  the  online  databases  in  their  users.
