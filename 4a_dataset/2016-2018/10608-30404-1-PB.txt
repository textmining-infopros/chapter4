ABSTRACT 
Accuracy in cataloguing records is of paramount importance in catalogues.  It is not diffcult to imagine that  errors in the metadata hamper the retrieval of bibliographic records.  The present study attempts to investigate the  error rate found in the metadata records of the Mysore University Library (MUL). The MUL is one of the oldest  university libraries in the country, India. The study selected and analysed the accuracy of 624 metadata records of  the Mysore University Library along with 491 records of Library of Congress (LoC). The assessment of the selected  records discerned two main types of errors notably: Major and minor errors. These fndings illustrate and prove  that the percentage of error rate in MUL is higher than that of LoC. Consequently, the study highlighted that the  prevailing error ratio between both institutions reaches almost up to 5:1 (MUL: LoC).

1. INTRODUCTION 
Accurate  metadata  records  are  the  backbone  of  user  services  in  libraries.  A  purview  of  the  history  in  the  field  underpins  that  there  have  been  some  efforts  to  enhance  the  quality  of  metadata  records  regarding  accuracy  and  completeness.  The  invention  of  a  myriad  of  cataloguing  codes  is  one  such  enterprise  to  ensure  the  quality,  standard,    and  consistency  in  the  metadata  records. Accurate and comprehensive catalogue data bear  a  direct  influence  on  the  effectiveness  of  user  search  of  the  metadata  inacunate  inconstent.  The  presence  of  errors  in  ‘records/data’  dwindle  the  efficiency  of  the  retrieval  capability  of  the  catalogue.  This  study  concentrates  on  studying  the  accuracy  of  metadata  in  the  bibliographic  records  of  Mysore  University  Library  (MUL).  The  corresponding  records  in  LoC  were  tested  for  accuracy  and  comprehensiveness.  
The  study  analyses  the  metadata  records  for  the  errors such as incorrect bibliographic information, omitted  elements, misspelling, MARC code errors and deviations  from  cataloguing  rules.  An  inaccurate  or  inconsistent  metadata  compels  readers  to  perform  repeated  searches  either to find the records they seek or to find everything  of  interest.  The  inaccuracies  in  metadata  cast  doubt  on  the  quality  of  other  accessible  records  and  offer  a  bad  impression  of  the  library’s  services. 
2. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Thomas1  defines quality as encompassing consistency,  depth, appropriateness and timeliness as well as accuracy.  Even if perfection is not desirable, and users are satisfied  with only partial success in retrieval, high standards and  
accuracy  of  library  catalogues  are  essential.  Libraries  themselves  need  accurate  inventories  of  their  collection  for  providing  the  services.  OCLC  records  have  been  the  benchmark  for  studying  the  accuracy  of  metadata.  Zeng2-3  has based his examination on a randomly selected  set  of  1306  records  related  to  the  Chinese  language  records.  The  study  considers  the  OCLC  sample  which  composed of 853 records OCLC CJK and 453 RLIN CJK  member-contributed  records.  Zeng2-3   has  identified  the  common errors and systematized them into three classes:  format,  content,  and  editing  and  inputting  errors.  Shin4  study  examined  only  monographic  records  through  the  randomly  selected  from  623  records  in  which  OCLC  sample  had  508  records,  and  the  remaining  115  records  were from RLIN. Fung-yin5  conducted a similar study in  which the researcher analysed 380 Chinese monographic  records  selected  from  OCLC’s  WorldCat  (the  OCLC  Online Union Catalogue) which were processed between  October  1995  to  February  1996  in  the Asian  Library  of  the University of Illinois at Urban-Champaign. Jia6 made  an  effort  to  identify  the  errors  in  the  metadata.  They  have  examined  the  randomly  selected  set  of  454  OCLC  metadata  records.  Errors  were  found  in  nearly  half  of  the  records  in  the  sample. 
Benchmarks  other  than  OCLC  have  been  used  in  some studies. Manaf & Rahman7   studied  the  Malaysian  National Library CIP comparing with the National Library  OPAC by using the discovery method. The data indicates  that  their  CIP  bibliographic  records  are  different  from  those  from  the  National  Library  OPAC  in  some  cases  such  as  main  entry.  The  study  extracts  a  total  of  341  CIP  records  (January  to  April  2000)  in  an  attempt  to  observe,  compare  and  evaluate  the  CIP  records.  Zarei8

reviews the consistency of information elements status of  163  CIP  records  and  compression  with  Catalogue  after  Publication (OPAC) records of the Iranian National Library  Bibliographic  Center  in  between  1997  to  2007.  
The cataloguing standards, such as AACR and ISBD,  have been the reference points for checking the accuracy  of  bibliographic  description. Ajis  &  Manaf9 chose  a  set  of 500 samples of the bibliographic records which were  analysed based on their compliance with the International  Standards  like  AACR2  and  MARC  21.  Another  similar  study  was  conducted  by  Enang10 whereby  the  National  bibliographic agencies create records for 250 publishers  issued  in  each  country,  using  ISBD  as  a  guide.  
The  sample  size  is  one  of  the  issues  that  drew  the  attention  of  the  researchers.  Massey  &  O’Brien11   and  Chapman  &  Massey12   have  argued  that  the  number  of  records in the sample depends on the acceptable margin  of error in the result, but it does not depend on the size  of  the  population  (provided  fewer  than  10%  of  records  are  to  be  sampled,  which  is  almost  always  the  case).  Hewitt13  has taken 2500 records for his study. Mansor 
14  has investigated the variant metadata practices that affect  the  development  of  a  cooperative  cataloguing  program  in Malaysia. 410 MARC records were sampled from the  OPAC databases of three university libraries in Malaysia.  This  study  focused  on  the  selected  MARC  fields,  i.e.,  that  is  for  the  name,  title  and  subject  access  points. 
3. METHODOLOGY 
The  present  study  was  conceived  to  investigate  the  quality of MUL metadata records regarding its accuracy  and  comprehensiveness  of  resource  description.  The  Mysore University Library (MUL) has around 4.79 million  printed  books;  wherein  in  this  study,  a  sample  of  624  items  have  been  examined.  The  metadata  records  were  selected  using  random  sampling.  The  major  reason  for  restricting the sample size is the constraints of time and  financial  resources  available  to  carry  out  the  study.  
A  set  of  error  category  was  developed  to  facilitate  the  categorisation  of  errors  occurring  in  the  sample  records. The errors have been classified broadly into two  groups: Major and minor. In a bibliographic record, this  study considers that major errors include: entry omission,  misspelling  and  wrong  entry,  misplacing  entry,  hyphen  inserted at wrong places and errors in the transliteration  of  ISBN.  Minor  errors,  on  the  other  hand,  consist  of  missing  full  stops  and  punctuation,  inadequate  spacing,  incorrect  upper  and  lower  case  so  on  and  so  forth.  
A systematic approach is used for the data collection.  The  fifth  book  (as  on  15-07-2015  to  19-07-2015)  from  the  left  side  of  the  middle  compartment  of  every  rack  available  in  the  stack  area  (including  the  three  floors)  and the active-stack area formed the bibliographic entity  to  be  examined  for  the  study. Through  this  method,  the  researchers  ensured  that  at  least  one  book  from  each  rack  of  MUL  was  taken  for  the  study.  The  metadata  of  624  documents  as  found  in  the  OPACs  of  MUL  and  
Library  of  Congress  (LoC)  were  compared  for  further  analysis.  MUL  OPAC  was  searched  for  each  item  in  the  sample  through  the  ‘Accession  Number’–the  unique  identifier  given  for  each  book  procured  in  the  library,  and  LoC  OPAC  was  searched  through  the  title  the  624  records, the metadata of 491 (78.69 %) were found MUL  OPAC.  It  was  surprising  to  note  that  the  database  does  not  still  contain  the  records  about  21.31  %  of  items  from  the  sample.  On  investigating  into  the  reasons  for  such  omissions,  it  was  found  out  that  the  retrospective  conversion  of  the  library  stack  is  in  progress.  Hence,  it  is  unlikely  that  all  records  are  available  on  OPAC.  As  we  understand  from  the  concerned  authorities,  the  conversion  process  is  completed  for  the  collection  on  the first floor of the stack area and all the collection of  active-stack  in  other  floors.  Hence,  it  may  be  assumed  that  there  is  a  drop  in  the  overall  percentage  of  books  found  in  the  OPAC.  However,  it  was  found  that  even  in  the  areas  where  the  conversion  process  is  over  the  retro-conversion  is  probably  not  exhaustive  yet.  For  instance, out of the 272 books from the first floor of the  stack area, the researchers could get only 236 (86.76 %)  records  in  the  MUL  OPAC.  It  is  unfair  or  too  early  to  pass  the  judgment  on  the  completeness  of  the  coverage  as  the  retro-conversion  project  is  still  in  progress.  
Only  those  records  which  were  found  in  MUL  were  searched  in  LoC  so  that  comparison  is  possible.  As  said  earlier,  the  LoC  records  are  considered  as  the  benchmark for comparison. Thus, only 491 records were  considered for searching in LoC catalogue. Special care  has  been  taken  to  verify  that  the  same  edition  of  the  books  from  both  MUL  and  LoC  were  compared.  The  initial  data  element  used  for  searching  LoC  was  the  title  of  the  document. To  identify  the  specific  matching  records in LoC, the other details such as author, edition,  and  year  of  publication  among  others  considered.  In  all  350 (71.28%) out of 491 records were available in LoC.  These  records  established  the  basis  for  further  analysis.  It  is  worth  stating  that  141  books  in  MUL  were  not  found  in  LoC.  One  of  the  reasons  is  that  from  the  141  books, 50 are books published by vernacular publishers.  However,  it  is  not  surprising  that  these  books  were  not  found  in  the  LoC  database.  However,  the  researchers  could  not  get  convincing  reasons  for  the  remaining  91  foreign  authored  books  (mostly  published  by  publishers  from  the  western  countries)  which  were  available  in  MUL  but  absent  in  LoC. 
4. FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS 
Metadata as found in both libraries–MUL and LOC,  were  compared  for  their  differences. Appropriate  tables  were  created  in  Microsoft  Excel.    
4.1 Accuracy  in  Data  Entry  Regarding  ISBNs 
The ISBN tag is a key element in the bibliographic  description of monographs. It is also predominantly used  by  for  retrieval  of  books  and  similar  items.  The  study

Total 155 (100.00) 142 (100) looked  into  the  accuracy  in  data  entry  as  far  as  ISBNs  are  concerned  in Table  1. 
From the 491 records considered for the study, 297  (60.49  %)  records  possessed/bore  the  ISBN  tag  in  their  metadata  records.  It  was  found  that  the  records  found  in  the  LoC  database  are  error  free.  On  the  other  hand,  14.84  %  of  the  records  found  in  the  MUL  metadata  consisted of major errors. As the ISBN tag is significant,

LoC record  0122154509 |a 0521215153 |a 0192125826  
it is imperative that ISBN numbers should be error-free  in metadata records. Example- Record 1 shows the ISBN  field  variants. 
4.2     Accuracy  Rate  of  Main  Entry 
The MARC tag 100 contains the personal name as the  main entry, whereas 110 is for corporate name. According  to AACR2  rules  (even  the  latest  RDA),  the  main  entry  is assigned to the person/institute chiefly responsible for  the  intellectual  or  artistic  content  of  the  resource.  The  cataloguer  pays  utmost  importance  for  the  preparation  of this metadata element. Any error in this element may  prove  costly  in  the  retrieval  of  the  resource.  
It  can  be  observed  from  Table  2  that  413  out  of  491  records  have  the  main  entry  tags  in  their  metadata  records.  MUL  has  more  than  50.00  %  errors  in  their  main entry data field. The majority of records (98.28 %)  examined  in  the  LoC  were  found  to  be  error  free.  This  comparison  of  MUL  and  LoC  gives  a  stern  warning  to  MUL  to  pay  a  very  serious  attention  to  the  creation  of  metadata records. Example-Record 2 shows the variants  of  Main  entry  field.

pay  a  lot  of  attention  in  giving  titles  to  their  works.  Diligence  is  warranted  in  data  entry  of  this  metadata  element in a record. It was hypothesised that the number  of  errors  in  this  field  would  be  minimal. 
Table  3  depicts  the  accuracy  rate  of  entry  field  title  statement  (245)  in  LoC  and  MUL  online  metadata.  It  was  found  that  93.28  %  contains  one  or  the  other  type  of  errors  in  the  title  statement  data  field  in  both  the  libraries  together.  44.6  %  of  the  records  found  in  MUL  consists  major  errors  in  the  title  statement  data  field. Almost  50  %  of  records  bear  minor  errors  in  the  title statement data field. It is evident from Table 3 that  almost  all  the  records  in  MUL  consist  one  or  the  other  type  of  errors  in  the  title  statement.  On  the  other  hand,  73.71  %  of  the  records  found  in  LoC  are  error  free  in  the  title  statement  data  field.

The  results  indicate  that  there  is  an  urgency  to  check  the  whole  database  for  the  accuracy  of  title  data  in  MUL  OPAC.  The  inaccuracies  hamper  the  retrieval  of  information  based  on  the  title.  An  example  of  kind  of  errors  found  in  MUL  OPAC  regarding.

4.4 Accuracy  Rate  of  the  Edition  Statement 
It  is  not  uncommon  to  see  a  work  appearing  in  different  versions.  The  edition  statement  (tag  250  in  MARC) contains the information related to various versions  of  a  resource.  Edition  information  is  an  individualising  element for uniquely identifying the resource and hence  requires  a  lot  of  attention  while  recording  its  details  in  the  database.  Table  4  illustrates  the  accuracy  rate  of  the  edition  statement  found  in  the  metadata  records  of  MUL  and  LoC  databases.  On  one  hand,  it  was  found  that  major  errors  in  edition  statement  data  field  were  to  the  tune  of  51.02  %  in  MUL  records  which  is  quite  high  by  any  standards.  On  the  other  hand,  LoC  has  an  accuracy  rate  of  92.31  %  about  the  data  field  edition  statement  (250)  which  is  at  a  satisfactory  level.  
Example: Record 4. Edition statement feld variants

LoC record |a 2nd ed. |a 2nd ed. 
As stated for other elements, MUL falls behind LoC  as far as accuracy of data entry in tag 250 also. The kinds  of errors found are shown below as a sample. Examples  of  edition  statement  field  variants  in  record  4. 
4.5 Accuracy  Rate  of  Publication  Description 
Table  5  depicts  the  publication  description  data  (260)  as  found  in  MUL  and  LoC  metadata  records  respectively. The accuracy of data elements such as year  of publication, publishers name and place of publication  have  been  scrutinised  in  the  metadata  records.  It  was  on  one  hand  found  that  28.68  %  of  the  records  certain  minor  errors.  On  the  other  hand,  LoC  records  contain  very few errors in relations to the publication description  data  element.  Examples  of  publication  description  field  Examples  of  publication  description  field  are  shown  in  Example-Record  5.

without recording the details related to the collation which  includes  preliminary  and  text  pages,  illustration  details,  accompanying  materials,  etc.  Though  the  information  contained in this metadata element is not normally used  for  retrieval  of  resource,  they  are  certainly  useful  for  comprehensively  and  uniquely  describing  a  resource.  Hence,  diligence  is  expected.  
4.6 Accuracy  Rate  of  Physical  Description 
Table 6 depicts the physical description data as found  in MUL and LoC metadata records. Almost 20 % records  in  MUL  database  include  major  errors.  However,  10  %  of  the  LoC  records  certain  major  error  about  physical  description. A  minor  error  was  also  found  in  MUL  and  LoC metadata records as well. 22.40 % records in MUL  and 4.86 % records in LoC possess minor errors in their  metadata records, respectively. The physical description

of responsibility appear in the MARC tag 700. Like the  field  100,  this  metadata  element  contains  the  details  of  authors  other  than  the  first/major  author  indicated  in  the  resource.    It  is  needless  to  emphasise  that  accuracy  is  paramount  in  recording  the  details  in  this  element  also.    
4.7 Accuracy  Rate  of Added  Entry 
Table  7  indicates  the  quantum  of  errors  found  in  added entry personal name data field in metadata records  of  MUL  and  LoC’s  online  database.    It  was  found  that  60.00%  of  the  records  in  MUL  database  include  one  or  the other type of errors (major and minor errors) in added  entry–personal  name  data  element.  LoC,  on  the  other  hand, contains significantly lesser error rate as depicted  by  the  data  collected  for  this  study.  It  was  found  that  the  error  rate  in  LoC  was  only  11.00%.  
Added  entry-personal  name  is  a  key  access  point  for document retrieval in libraries; users would approach  
  Example: Record 7. Added entry feld variants record Record no. MUL record  LoC record 04 Dickson W. Patrick Dickson, W. Patrick 
many  times  with  a  second  or  third  or  through  an  editor  for  retrieving  books  from  the  library.  Consequently,  it  is  essential  to  have  added  entry  element  error  free  in  metadata  records.  The  type  of  errors  that  were  found  are  shown  in  Example-record  7. 
4.8  Total  Error  of  Metadata  Records 
Table  8  exposes  an  expressed  error  rate  that  MUL  records  possess  the  average  error  rate  of  2.58  %,  and  LoC  records  hear  the  average  rate  of  0.50  %  from  the  study,  It  was  detected  that  the  error  ratio  between  the  institutions  is  almost  5:1  (MUL:  LoC).

A  comparative  study  of  the  metadata  records  was  conducted  for  evaluating  the  accuracy  of  the  selected  bibliographic  databases  from  two  agencies.  Quality  in  metadata  is  a  vital  prerequisite  in  library  services  for  both  patrons  and  staff.  The  general  availability  of  all  library  resources  is  directly  affected  by  the  quality  of  the  library  database. 
The purpose of this study was to alert metadata creators  about  some  major  problems  in  metadata  records  and  to  offer  choose  for  improvement.  Ideally,  the  suggestions  given  in  the  study  will  assist  metadata  professionals  to  avoid  these  errors  altogether.  This  study  can  also  be  beneficial  in  the  training  of  new  metadata  creators  and

may  inspire  other  researchers  to  investigate  the  quality  of  metadata  records  through  other  innovative  tools.
