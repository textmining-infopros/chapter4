AbSTRACT 
Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) E-Journal Consortium is one of the important  consortiums among other consortia existing in India. It covers multi-disciplinary subject areas to fulfll the information  needs  of  DRDO  scientifc  community. This  paper  tries  to  evaluate  the  implementation  of  DRDO  e-journals,  coverage of publishers and titles, subject-wise distribution of titles among DRDO laboratories, need of e-journal  consortium among the labs, and expenditure details along with yearly growth. This is one of the unique consortiums  implemented that is based on subscription model.The study also highlights the usage of e- journals publisher-wise  in the consortium and would be helpful in effcient collection development policy of e-journals.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The growth of e-publishing world around has completely  metamorphosed  the  scholarly  journal  publication  including  its  subscription,  access  and  the  way  they  are  delivered  to  users.  The  important  features  offered  by  electronic  journals  (e-journals) to library users can be summed up as instant and  easy access, link to other resources; multimedia capabilities,  remote access; search ability, independent of space and time.  This  variety  of  information  available  in  various  resources  has  made  the  information  handling  process  more  complex  and cumbersome. It is quite diffcult for an individual library  having  limited  budgets  to  procure  and  subscribe  each  and  every information resources demanded by its potential users  as  per  their  diversifed  information  needs.  Research  and  development organisations in India are spending a lion’s share  in the subscription of e-journals yearly1. Despite this, they are  not in a state to sustain the subscription of key journals related  to their areas of interest. So the libraries felt the need to share  their  resources  with  other  libraries  to  overcome  budgetary  constraints2.  
The popular e-journal Consortia established in India are  The National  Knowledge  Resource  Consortium  (NKRC),  Indian  National  Digital  Library  in  Engineering  Sciences  and  Technology (INDEST),  UGC-Infonet  Digital  Library  Consortium (now E-ShodhSindhu), National Medical Library’s  Electronic  Resources  in  Medicine  Consortium  (ERMED),  DBT e-Library Consortium (DeLCON) and DRDO E-Journal  Consortium3.  They  have  mainly  focused  on  e-resources  sharing through e-journal consortium among the institutions/ organisations.

2. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Much of the literature in this area is devoted to the use and  impact of e-resources specifcally in academic libraries, as well  as the selection, acquisition, issues, and access of e-resources  in general. Some notable work by Bhardwaj4  highlighted the  benefts of e-resources use such as saving time, quick access, and  access to e-archives. Chirra and Madhusudhan5 explored that  e-journals have become vital part of information for research  work. Another study by Madhusudhan6 shows that e-journals  perform an increasingly important role in research. In addition  to current e-journals, research scholars and students need to be  provided with electronic back issues as well. Madhusudhan7  also unveiled that electronic resources have become an integral  part of the information needs of research scholars. 
Jotwani8 analysed that IIT libraries spent a signifcantly  large proportion of their budgets to acquire e-resources. There  is a clear shift in the collection development policies of these  libraries where e-resources have become a vital part of their  core collections. Natalee9 found that the provision of e-library  resources  has  increased  overall  usage  of  library  materials  as  patrons  continue  to  use  print  resources  in  tandem  with  electronic  versions. The  study  also  found  that  the  electronic  library resources play an important role in enhancing access  to library resources necessary for quality research papers and  academic excellence on a whole. 
Nisha & Ali10  examined the use of e-journals by the users  of IIT Delhi and Delhi University and established that users  were consulting e-journals for retrieving information regarding  research, publishing research papers and largely to update their  own knowledge. Varaprasad & Madhusudhan11  discussed the  advantage of consortium that saves the time of the user since  instant  access  will  be  available  after  every  updating  unlike

the shipping time, missing issues, and mutilations. etc., which  prevail in respect of print media. 
Mukherjee  &  Kumar12  discussed  about  the  use  of  e-journals  subscribed  under  UGC  Infonet  Digital  Library  Consortia  and  identifed  that  there  is  a  demand  for  more  e-journal titles although a substantial number of users (61.90  percent) are satisfed with the existing model of UGC-Infonet  Consortium. 
haridas  &  Khan13 discovered  that  NASSDOC  library  users are aware of e-resources and large number of research  scholars  and  faculty  members  use  them  for  their  research  work.  Observations  of  Krishnamurthy  &  Kumbar14 revealed  that  e-resources  are  becoming  more  popular  and  considered  as a better substitute of print journals. Swain15  divulges that  libraries should take active participation in various e-journal  consortia for maximising procurement of e-journals at minimal  cost on sharing basis by which institutes can afford to balanced  e-subscriptions without much fnancial burden. Kaur & Verma16 found that usage of e-journals is increasing due to awareness  of the library e-resources and services among the users. Owing  to an easy access available at various places in the institute,  users are accessing these resources at hostels and departments  more as compared to the library. The users coming to library  have decreased. 
3. DRDO  E-JOURNAL  CONSORTIUM

5. METHODOLOGY 
The Case study method was used to get an in-depth idea  about  DRDO  E-Journals  Consortium.  The  present  study  is  confned to DRDO e-journals consortium during the period of  2009 to 2016. 
6. DATA ANALYSIS AND  DISCUSSION 
Electronic  journals  represent  a  signifcant  and  growing  part of the special library’s offerings. E-journals are changing  rapidly  and  leading  to  new  generation  of  libraries.  On  one  side,  there  is  an  increasing  demand  for  good  quality  library  collections in terms of large amount of information and on the  other  hand,  the  publishing  media  is  striving  hard  to  support  the demand at lightning speed by way of e-journals as well as  online access. 
6.1 E-Journals  covered  under  DRDO  e-journals  
Consortium 
Selection of e-journals is very important step in e-journals  consortium  process.  If  the  right  e-journal  is  selected,  the  usage  of  such  e-journal  will  certainly  be  high.  Looking  at  the  developments  at  the  national  and  international  level  and  the  success  of  INDEST-AICTE  and  CSIR-DST  consortia  in  meeting  the  multifarious  information  requirements2,  the  DRDO e-Journal consortium was implemented by DESIDOC  on 01 January 2009 covering 446 titles from 7 publishers. Over  the period of eight years, few publishers have also been added  to the consortium. The following publishers are covered under  the  DRDO  E-Journal  consortium  for  the  beneft  of  DRDO  scientifc  community.  Association  of  Computing  Machinery  (ACM),  American  Chemical  Society  (ACS),  American  Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), American  Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Elsevier, Institute  of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Jane’s, Nature,  Science, and Taylor and francis (T&f). Summary of Table 1 is  depicted in fig. 1.

Figure 1. E-Journals covered in DRDO e-journals consortium. 
It has been observed from Table 1and fig. 1, among all  publishers  IEEE  occupies  top  position  covering  219  titles  followed by Elsevier contributing 194 titles. In terms of number  of titles subscribed during the study it was found that 551 titles  were subscribed in 2012 followed by 529 titles in 2014. It is  also evident from the table that only in the year 2012, all the  publishers provided e-journal access without discontinuation to  their services. It is also observed from the table that the services  of publishers ACS, AIAA, ASME, Elsevier, Science and T&f have been discontinued due to various reasons resulted in less  number  of  titles  in  the  consortia  by  2016.  Summing  up  the  data, it was observed that Elsevier & IEEE have covered the  maximum number of titles although Elsevier was discontinued  in the year 2016.  
6.2 Labs  Covered  under  DRDO  E-Journal  
Consortium 
Each  lab  in  DRDO  has  its  requirements  of  e-journals  which highlights lab’s focus on R&D. As a result, every lab  has  access  to  specifc  number  of  e-journals  through  DRDO  e-journal consortium. Table 2 provides data about the respective  publishers and their access to titles in each lab. 
Table 2 communicates that currently publishers namely  ACM, IEEE, Jane’s, and Nature have continued their service  for the past eight years without discontinuation. however, the  publisher ASME sustained for three years followed by ACS  and T&f  which equally share four years. Data also revealed  that ASME and T&f  were late entrant in the consortia which

facilitated least number of titles and less number of labs covered  lead to discontinuation of their services in the consortium by  DRDO. 
The publisher ACM has the minimal covering labs (fve)  where  as  IEEE  covers  all  DRDO  labs  even  though  IEEE  consisting of the subjects’ electronics and computer science.  The data highlights that IEEE was subscribed only for those  labs  which  are  mainly  working  in  the  feld  electronics  but  the  publisher  extended  its  service  to  all  DRDO  labs  so  that  other  DRDO  scientists  may  make  use  of  this  facility  while  working in other labs. ACS had also extended its e-journals  access  to  all  DRDO  labs,  however  it  has  been  discontinued  after 2012. Elsevier provides e-journals access to 42 labs on  subscription basis and extended all subscribed e-journals to 06  labs. The publisher Nature covered 27 labs in 2014 which has  been reduced to 9 labs in 2016, this was due to less usage of  the e-journals. The same situation has applied to Jane’s which  earlier covered 30 labs in 2009 and ended with 5 labs in 2016.  As evident from the data in Table 2 that the number of labs  covered in DRDO e-journals consortia is reducing for most of  the publishers. 
6.3 Year-wise  Expenditure 
figure 2 presents the year-wise total expenditure incurred  for subscription of DRDO e-journals Consortium. 
Figure 2. Year-wise expenditure detail (amount in Crore). 
The Fig. 2 refects that a total of Rs. 20.83 crore has been  spent on subscription of journals in 2015, which was maximum  during all eight years followed by 2014 where Rs 19.15 crore  were spent on the subscription of journals. It was also found  that there is a price escalation every year minimum by 5 per  cent. 2016 has reported an expenditure of Rs 7.42 crore only  which was due to discontinuation of Elsevier publisher, a major  shareholder in the consortia along with T&f. 
6.4 Subject-wise  Distribution  of  E-journal Titles 
The  mission  of  the  DRDO  e-journals  consortium  is  to  provide scientists with information and access to information  in  support  of  scholarly  activity  and  research.  Subject-wise  distribution of e-journals among DRDO labs is presented in  fig. 3. 
figure  3  reveals  that  the  subject  Electronics  has  been  subscribed extensively with 220 titles followed by computer  science contained 167 titles. Engineering possess 75 titles and

chemistry  having  61  titles  shared  the  third  and  fourth  place  accordingly. It is evident to mention here that DRDO has been  involved in many S&T activities covering aerospace, physics,  materials,  electrical,  biology,  environment,  mechanical  and  naval science which are directly related to defence R&D. The  reason  for  holding  more  titles  in  electronics  and  computer  science is due to subscription of full package of IEEE and ACM  journals which are nearly half the strength of the total number  of e-journals subscribed in DRDO e-journals consortium.  
6.5 Usage  Statistics 
year-wise usage statistics of e-journals used by labs from  each publisher can be discerned from the data given in Table 3.  It is evident that the publisher Elsevier has been used heavily  by the DRDO scientifc community and occupied top position  with 30 lakh downloads followed by IEEE with 11.80 lakhs  downloads. T&f  was placed at the last position with 46,000+  downloads; because of its sustenance only for four years. The  publishers ACS and IEEE have maintained the consistency in  terms  of  usage  throughout  these  eight  years. however,  high  and low usage has been noticed from the remaining publishers  over these years. Remarkable usage has been reported from the  publishers ACM, ASME, Elsevier, Nature and Science during  2014.

7. FINDINGS 
• Maximum number of e-journal titles were subscribed  
during 2012 where as minimum number of titles were  
reported from 2016. 
• IEEE contains maximum number of titles, which are  
available to all 50 DRDO labs where as ACM is being  
provided to only 5 labs. 
• In subject-wise distribution of titles, Electronics has  
the highest number of e-journals subscribed being at  
the top position where as Naval Sciences contain only  
7 titles and comes in last position. 
• During 2012, all publishers have been existed in the  
DRDO e-journal consortium without discontinuation  
of their services. 
During  2015,  DRDO  e-journal  consortium  spent  20.83  crores which was maximum in terms of expenditure. It  is evident that double of the amount has increased within  seven years of period since its inspection i.e. from 2009.  But on the other side, when we compare the increase in  the  number  of  e-journals,  it  has  been  observed  that  78  titles  have  been  added  to  the  consortium,  this  was  also  one of the reasons for price escalation. 
The exorbitant prices of major stock holding publishers  namely ACM, AIAA, Elsevier, and IEEE have increased  nearly double of the price during last eight years but their  titles are also almost the same in number except IEEE. The exchange of foreign currency (conversion rate) into  Indian currency was also the other factor for hike in the  prices. 
The  publishers  Elsevier  and  IEEE  are  highly  used  in  the  consortium  whereas ASME  and  T&f   are  less  used  publishers. The usage of e-journals is not upto the mark  as expected. Some labs are using them to the maximum  but others are not. 
8. CONCLUSIONS 
The DRDO e-journals consortium is one of the important  resources for the scientifc community to carry out the research  activities.  It  has  very  signifcant  publishers  that  publish  scientifc journals and magazines directly relevant to the R&D

community of  DRDO. DRDO spends nearly 20 crore per annum  for  the  subscription  of  these  e-journals. The  discontinuation  of publishers in the consortium due to various reasons is not  encouraging  since  the  scientifc  community  always  thrust  for the information. The journal articles mainly bring out the  latest  developments  in  a  particular  feld,  discontinuation  of  the  e-journals  may  directly  affect  the  research  output  of  the  organisation.  Scientists  and  staff  should  be  motivated  and  trained to use e-journals for their research, development and  academic pursuit. It is suggested that training and orientation  programmes should be made available in each DRDO lab for  optimum use of available e-journals.
