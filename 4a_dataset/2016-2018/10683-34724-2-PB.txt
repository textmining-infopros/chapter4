1.  INTRODUCTION 
Reputation and prestige of any institution greatly depends  upon its research productivity and its impact. Various rating  organisations  and  funding  agencies  give  weight  to  research  publications  of  an  institute.  The  present  study  examines  research output of Guru Nanak Dev University in physics and  astronomy by using scientometric techniques. 
Scientometric  analysis  technique  has  emerged  in  the  last  few  years  and  it  fundamentally  deals  with  the  study  of  quantifying and analysing science and technology and overall  research performance of an institution. It is a science of the  application  of  mathematical  and  statistical  methods  which  are  often  developed  to  measure  and  evaluate  the  scientifc  publications.  Being  a  unique  research  area,  scientometrics  is  utilised  to  quantify  national  and  international  systems  of  innovation  which  helps  in  developing  policy  in  science  and  technology and derives long term economic and social benefts.  It is utilised to identify the pattern of publication, authorship,  productive  author,  author  affliation,  year-wise  growth,  citations and behaviour of a subject over a period of time and  thereby offering insight into the dynamics of the area under  study which in turn may help to formulate science policy1.  
Guru Nanak Dev University was established at Amritsar  on November 24, 1969 to mark the 500th birth anniversary of  Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It is both a residential and an affliating

6.  CONCLUSIONS 
The  Guru  Nanak  Dev  University  during  2006-15  published  total  652  publications  in  physics  and  astronomy,  with  an  annual  average  growth  rate  of  9.6    %  and  overall  research  productivity  increased  from  277  during  2006-10  to  375 in 2011-15, witnessing a growth rate of 35.38  %. Amongst  the  25  most  productive  Indian  Universities  in  physics  and  astronomy, GNDU stood at 23rd  rank in term of publications  output (652) and 7th  rank in h-index (29), 16 
th 
 rank in average  citation per paper (7.01 %) and 18th  rank in share of high cited  papers  (1  %) Among  652  papers  in  physics  and  astronomy  by  GNDU  160  authors  participated,  of  which  the  top  20  most productive authors contributed 92.94  % and 91.82  %  share  to  its  total  publications  and  citations  during  2006-15.  The  top  15  comparatively  higher  cited  papers  appearing  in  citation range from 40-80 together account for 775 citations,  leading to average citation per paper of 50.47 %. The study  clearly  indicates  that  journals  are  the  most  preferred  form  of  publication  to  communicate  their  research  works  by  the  researchers of GNDU.  
From analysis it is clear that Guru Nanak Dev University’s  contribution  in  physics  and  astronomy  lags  far  behind  other  leading Indian universities, in terms of both publications output  and  citation  impact.  It  is  suggested  that  the  university  must  give a genuine thought to expand its research output and raise  its quality and impact. The university could increase through  international collaboration not only the exploration effciency  of its researchers, but also may encourage change in citations  of  its  publications.   The  university  should  create  research  promoting  environment  by  building  infrastructure  facilities  and conducting workshops to upgrade research and publishing  efforts of its researchers. This will also enhance the reputation  of the university and have a positive infuence on university  ranking. Extraordinary honors and incentives should be given  to the faculty members for publishing in high impact journal.  Proper strategies should be adopted to remove imbalances in

research output and to promote participatory research projects  with other universities.  
Although,  GNDU  library  has  subscription  of  many  e-resources,  there  is  further  need  to  strengthen  and  enhance  access  to  e-resources  especially  in  the  feld  of  physics  and  astronomy  and  its  allied  subject  areas.  The  fndings  of  the  research  will  be  helpful  for  various  strategy-making  bodies  and  funding  organisations  to  provide  enhanced  fnancial  support  to  GNDU.  It  is  also  observed  from  this  study  that  physics and astronomy contribution is at 3rd  position among  all the departments of GNDU. Therefore, it is suggested that  if  funding  agencies  provide  more  funds  in  term  of  research  grant  to  this  department,  more  research  publications  will  be  produced in future.
