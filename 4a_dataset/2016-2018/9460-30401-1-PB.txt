Availability of various information and communication technology (ICT) tools and accessibility of electronic  information resources have fuelled the growth of e-learning all over the world. Present paper focuses on the use  and awareness of various e-resources available in Punjab Agricultural University Library. The use of consortia  and e-databases is also analysed. The fndings of the study revealed that electronic resources have become an  integral part of the information for various features such as easy download and fast searching capability. Despite  the fact that e-resources have eased the task of research, respondents still prefer information in both print as well  
as electronic formats.

1. INtRODUCtION 
Agricultural  libraries  have  undergone  tremendous  change in terms of growth and development. Though many  factors  are  responsible  for  this  change,  but  technology  plays a significant role that enables sharing of information  resources worldwide. Electronic information resources have  become integral part of libraries and form an invaluable  tool for teaching, learning, and research. The revolution in  ICT, particularly the internet and web-based technologies,  have  a  profound  effect  on  information-based  resources  and  services.  Consequently,  libraries  have  witnessed  a  thespian shift in recent years both in service models and  collection  development  structures. 
Moreover,  availability  of  various  ICT  tools  such  as  tablets,  PCs,  smart  phones,  etc.,  and  accessibility  of  e-information  resources  have  fuelled  the  growth  of  e-learning  all  over  the  world.  This  study  is  an  attempt  to  present  the  use  and  awareness  of  all  e-resources  available  in  Punjab  Agricultural  University  library  and  problems  faced  by  the  users.  The  use  of  consortia  and  e-databases  is  also  analysed. 
1.1 Punjab Agricultural  University,  Ludhiana 
The Punjab Agricultural University1  (PAU) established  in  1962  excels  in  the  extension  of  agriculture  research  and  education.  Mohinder  Singh  Randhawa  Agricultural  University Library,  popularly known as,  Punjab Agricultural  University Library was established in 1959. The Library  houses about 2,43,716 books, 36,628 theses and 1, 03,040  periodicals. It also subscribes to various e-resources such  as  Consortium  of  electronic  resources  in  Agriculture  
(CeRA-online  database  of  full  text  journals),  J-gate  Agricultural and Biological sciences (online database of  abstracts  and  full  text  journals),  Indiastat.com  (online  database of statistical information); KrishiPrabha (online  database of theses submitted to all the state agricultural  universities (SAUs) and deemed agricultural universities  (DAUs)  under  National  Agricultural  Research  System  (NARS);  Myilibrary  (online  database  of  22  e-books);  CRCnetBASE  (online  database  of  12  e-books);  EBSCO  Netlibrary (online database of 17 e-books); ISO standards  on Food Products, etc. Besides, the Library also subscribes  to  158  Indian  and  61  foreign  print  journals  and  over  31,584  online  journals.  
2. LItERAtURE  REVIEW 
Large  number  of  studies  have  been  conducted  to  know  the  user  awareness  of  e-resources  in  the  fields  of  engineering,  management  and  medicine  but  the  studies  related  with  agricultural  universities  are  a  few.  Some  significant studies related to the study have been mentioned  here.  Singh  &  Satija2   reported  journals  as  the  most  and  dissertations/thesis  as  the  least  used  information  source by ICAR and PAU scientists, however, attending  seminar, workshops, conferences (77.6 %) ranked second.  Sankaranarayanan & Nagarajan3   found  e-journals  as  the  most  preferred  resource  by  the  faculty  of  agricultural  colleges  as  compared  to  online  database  (16.39  %)  and  e-books  (10  %).  Time  saving  and  easy  to  use  were  the  most  preferred  benefits  of  using  e-resources.  Okorie  &  Agboola4   examined  the  various  electronic  databases  and observed that 50 % respondents use, ‘The Essential  Electronic  Agricultural  Library  (TEEAL)’  database

followed  by  AGORA  (41.6  %),  AGRICOLA  (3  %),  AGRIS (2.5 %) and CAB Abstract (1.6 %). The problem  of power outage was maximum (50 %) followed by lack  of  adequate  computers  (18.3  %)  and  server  breakdown  (11.6 %). Parmar5  highlighted that the faculty of CCS hAU  preferred  to  access  e-journals  through  CeRA(97.87  %)  more as compared to search engines, publishers websites,  e-databases and other CDROM databases. Slow speed of  downloading,  slow  response  of  network,  lack  of  trained  staff  and  printing  problems  were  the  hampering  factors  reported. Francis6  discussed the utilisation of consortia- based  digital  information  resources  and  observed  the  use  of  online  journals  (91.43  %),  CD-ROM  databases  (69.29  %)  and  online  databases  (25.71  %).  Majority  of  respondents  (61.43  %)  access  the  e-resources  from  the  computer  centre  of  the  colleges.  The  resources  available  through  CeRA  were  used  by  87.14  %,  library  subscribed  online  resources  by  85.71  %  users  and  CD- ROM  database  by  65  %  users.  Most  of  the  users  were  not  satisfied  with  the  adequacy  of  CeRA  resources.  Goria7  focused on the importance of new tools to access  the  library  website  with  less  content  on  smart/mobile  phones for the maximum utilisation of library resources  and  services  resources.  hasan8   described  the  projects  associated  with  National  Agricultural  Research  System  (NARS); National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP)  and National Agricultural Technology Project (NATP) of  Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). Nikam  &  Kumar9   also  found  that  e-journals  is  the  most  used  e-resource among the faculty and research scholars. The  preference of format is slightly inclined towards the print  resources. The use of e-resources is mainly preferred for  clear display and easy to read format of the article. Title  approach  (mean  2.82)  is  the  most  popular  strategy  to  access  e-journals. The  users  identify  relevant  electronic  articles by ‘browsing through recent issues’ (mean=3.39)  followed by ‘searching full-text databases from publishers  or  aggregator  (e.g.  Elsevier,  Springer).  
Kandpal, Rawat & Vital10  established the awareness of  different e-resources like KrishiPrabha (26.5 %), Science  Direct  (20.4  %),  CeRA  (14.2  %),  and  OPAC  (38.8  %).  The  college  library  notice  board  (64.715)  was  the  main  source of information regarding e-resources. None of the  respondent use college website. The most used e-resources  were e-journals (50 %) and e-databases (39.28 %) while  nobody used e-theses and dissertations. The authors found  lower  number  of  e-resources  and  less  infrastructure  as  the problems hindering the use and access of e-resources.  Naqvi11   found  e-resources  were  mostly  used  for  the  research purpose. The mean score was obtained and found  that  CD-ROM  databases  (mean  3.14  PG  &  3.13  RS),  e-journals  (mean  2.63  PG  &  3.22  RS),  online  databases  (mean 1.43 PG & 2.07 RS) and e-books (mean 1.05 PG  & 1.47 RS) were the most used e-resources among users.  The  online  databases  like AGRIS  (2.92  PG  &  3.43RS),  AGRICOLA  (2.63  PG  &  3.11  RS),  CAB Abstract  (2.50  PG  &  3.57  RS), Agriculture  &  Natural  Resources  (2.47  
PG  &  2.32  RS)  and  FSTA  (1.53  PG  &  1.61  RS)  were  the  most  used  databases  among  the  respondents.  The  users  felt  inadequate  e-collection  as  compared  to  the  print collection. Bhat & Mudhol12   ascertained  that  most  of the users sought information through library catalogue  and  directly  visiting  the  book  shelves  as  compared  to  OPAC and online databases. MEDLINE is the most used  online  database  as  compared  to  e-journals  and  e-books.  Virus  problems,  limited  number  of  computer  terminals  and irrelevant information were the major lacunas behind  the  limited  access  of  e-resources.  Prakashe  &  Tayade13 focused upon the e-resources in the libraries of Institutes  of  Management  (IIM’s)  in  India  and  observed  that  all  the  libraries  are  having  e-resources  and  are  member  of  some library networks like DELNET, INFLIBNET,ERNET,  NICNET, etc. Authors proposed a resource sharing model  for the libraries that promises the maximum availability  of  e-resources.  Bhat  &  Ganaie14   assessed  the  use  of  electronic information resources (EIRs) and observed that  CeRA(94.23  %)  was  the  most  used  e-database  among  AGRIS  (64.42  %),  CABI  (50.96  %),  J-gate Agriculture  and  Biological  (26.92  %),  FSTA(19  %),  AGRICOLA  (18 %) and BIOSIS (14 %). The least used databases were  INDEST and UGC-Infonet Consortium. The users did not  make much use of e-books. The users preferred both the  formats  but  in  case  of  electronic  formats  they  preferred  online mode of access to information. Authors concluded  that  library  must  procure  equal  or  balanced  collection  as  well  as  better  and  reliable  access  to  its  e-resources.  Kumar15  ascertained that the most used e-resources were  e-research reports and search engines followed by ETD.  however,  very  few  used  e-journals,  e-books  and  online  databases. The title approach was the most used approach.  Very  few  users  used  DOI  approach. 
The  studies  so  far  are  limited  to  the  use  of  few  e-resources. The studies mostly concentrated on specific  e-resources  like  use  of  e-journals  or  use  of  CERA,  or  databases but not on all the available agricultural based  e-resources  altogether. A  comprehensive  study  has  been  undertaken to gain knowledge of the user awareness of all  the e-resources available in Punjab Agriculture University  Library and all the aspects associated with its use. This  study enables critical analysis of the existing information  dissemination  set  up,  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the organisation and the users preference of e-resources.  The  preference  of  e-resources  of  respondents  has  been  validated  by  taking  log  data  from  the  library  which  indicates  how  many  times  the  website  has  been  hit. 
3. ObJECtIVES  AND   ME tHODOLOGY 
Use of internet has become a part of higher learning.  To  keep  pace  with  the  evolving  needs  of  the  society,  libraries are reinventing themselves in terms of resources,  services  and  staff  and  have  become  dynamic  in  nature.  The web enabled applications have become a part of the  libraries and it is thus imperative to assess the awareness  and  use  of  e-resources  by  the  users.

The  study  is  confined  to  the  users  of  Mohinder  Singh Randhawa Punjab Agricultural University Library,  Ludhiana. Aim of this case study is to assess the purpose,  awareness and use of e-resources available in the university  library.  
The  objectives  of  the  present  study  is  to: (a) Know  the  awareness  and  use  of  e-resources (b) Identify  the  purpose  of  use  of  e-resources (c) Assess the impact of Cera and digital library project-  
based  information  resources 
(d) Explore  the  impact  of  user  education  programme (e) Suggest  suitable  measures  to  improve  the  use  of  
e-resources. 
A  structured  questionnaire  was  developed  for  the  purpose of data collection and distributed randomly to 150  users in the library from which, 92 responses (61.3 %) has  been received and analysed. The total number of students  registered are 1689. The users present in the reading hall  of the library were requested to fill the questionnaire. The  respondents  were  pursuing  graduation,  post  graduation  and  PhD  in  different  colleges  of  the  university  such  as  College of Agriculture, College of Agricultural Engineering  & Technology, College of Basic Sciences & humanities  and College of home Science. The data has been collected  from 62 respondents pursuing graduation, 22 respondents  pursuing  post-graduation  and  eight  PhD  candidates.  In  addition  to  personal  information,  various  significant  parameters  such  as  use  of  library,  e-resources  and  more  specifically  e-databases,  consortia  and  digital  library  Project,  etc.,  are  covered  in  the  questionnaire. The  data  collected  has  been  analysed  using  percentage.

ANALYSIS 
4.1 Use  of  Library: Visit  and  Frequency 
Application  of  web-based  technologies  to  libraries  have  brought  significant  shift  in  the  global  information  scenario.  The  students  today  approach  the  world  with  an ‘information age mindset’ and consider technology as  ‘a  fact  of  life’  Frand16.  It  is  thus  important  to  know  in  today’s  times  that  how  frequently  users  use  the  library  resources  and  services.  Table  1  shows  that  users  are  frequently  visiting  the  library.  Library  and  its  resources  are  of  immense  value  to  the  scholars,  researchers  and  students,  etc.  
4.2   t ime  Spend  and  Purpose  of  Visit  
Table 2 depicts that 37 % respondents spend one to

two hours per week in the library. Very few respondents  spend  more  than  four  hours  in  the  library. 
Table 3 shows the purpose for which the users visit  the university library. It can be observed from the Table 1  to Table 3 that the library is visited by the students more  often and the resources in it are highly used for research  work.  The  library  has  a  good  collection  of  books  and  they  are  being  used  by  its  users.  The  lower  percent  of  access  to  e-resources  corresponds  to  the  campus-wide  access  to  e-resources  and  hence  they  did  not  feel  more  need  to  visit  the  library  only  to  access  e-resources.  
table 3. Purpose of library visit 
Purpose Percentage (%) Issue/return of the document 30 To consult books in the library premises 39 Class Assignments 38 Research 61 To access e-resources 27 Recreation 10 To keep yourself update 13 4.3 Awareness,  Sources  of  Knowledge About    
E-resources 
Emergence of e-resources has dramatically changed  the  way  in  which  information  is  accessed  and  used.  Consequently,  e-resources  have  become  an  integral  part  in the library’s collection. It is thus becomes imperative  to  know  the  awareness  and  use  of  e-resources,  which  aid in real time access The result shows that 72 % users  were aware about e-resources and 28 % were not aware  regarding  e-resources. 
Table  4  shows  the  sources  or  channels  from  which  the users gained knowledge about e-resources. It can be  observed  that  respondents  are  aware  of  e-resources  and  friends and colleagues are the major source of information.  Analysing  the  collected  information  critically,  it  can  be  said  that  the  user  education  programme  is  not  even  as  effective  as  library  web  page  and  there  is  a  need  to  improve  both  the  facilities. 
4.4 Awareness  and  Usefulness  of  Library’s  Web  
Page 
Digital technologies especially the world wide web  have  a  great  potential  to  serve  the  challenges  faced  by  libraries. Any university's web page is a great source of

information  serving  remote  users  with  its  resources  and  services  in  an  efficient  way.  It  is  essential  in  today’s  time to assess the role of library’s webpage in providing  information. Replies regarding the awareness as well as  the  ratings  by  the  users,  77  %  users  were  aware  about  the  library  webpage,  however,  23  %  were  not  aware. 
Information  in  Table  4  and  5  show  that  there  is  a  need  to  conduct  an  effective  user  education  programme  to  make  them  understand  the  importance  of  a  library  webpage  and  the  resources  they  can  access  by  using  library  webpage.  Also  as  per  Table  5,  the  rating  of  library  webpage  'can't  say'  (22  %)  describes  that  the  library  webpage  needs  to  be  more  expressive.

4.5   t raining  on  Use  of  E-resources 
Training  is  the  most  essential  instrument  to  bridge  the  digital  divide  between  'have'  and  'have  not'.  Before  starting any particular venture, it is significant to consider  the  key  skills  of  employees  who  will  be  going  to  train  the  beneficiaries  or  users.  The  need  of  training  arises  due to technology-driven advancement and for improving  performance  or  as  part  of  professional  development.  The  vast  majority  of  respondents  (72  %)  though  aware  of  e-resources  did  not  have  any  formal  training  on  use  of  e-resources,  however,  only  28  %  received  formal  training. 
Table 6 shows the mode of training. The reasons given  by the users for not attending the training programme are  highlighted  in Table  7. The  information  gathered  shows  that  the  library  users  are  unaware  of  the  user  education  programme  are  conducted  by  the  library  for  the  users.  That is why the users rely on friends and colleagues for  information  as  per  data  of Table  4. 
Though,  think,  pair  and  share  is  a  good  aspect  of  any  classroom  education  programme,  the  library

provides  the  compulsory  course  paper  on  technical  writing,  communication  skills,  library  and  information  services  only  for  post  graduates  and  is  missing  in  the  curriculum  of  undergraduate  students.  It  is  pertinent  to  mention  here  that  virtual  tour  option  is  not  available  in  PAU  Ludhiana  library  webpage.  
4.6 Importance  of  E-resources 
The  respondents  we  asked  to  state  their  views  on  the  importance  of  various  features  of  e-resources.  Table  8  presents  their  preference  on  various  features  of  e-resources.  It  can  be  interpreted  that  the  ‘easy  to  download’  and  ‘fast  searching’  are  highly  significant  features  of  e-resources.  
4.7 Purpose  and  Search Approach  of Accessing  
E-resources 
Table 9 exhibits the purpose of accessing e-resources.  Regardless  of  the  fact  that  the  number  of  respondents  pursuing graduate courses are more than the respondents  pursuing  postgraduate  and  PhD  studies,  the  e-resources  are  being  used  more  for  research  and  project  work.  This  shows  that  the  students  are  more  inclined  towards

Table10 shows the search approach of the respondents  to  e-resources.  It  is  observed  that  title  approach  is  the  most  popular  among  the  respondents  as  compared  to  keywords or author. however, in the literary world keyword  approach is the most popular. On the other hand the onus  lies  on  the  professionals  to  reduce  the  information  gap  through  effective  user  education  programme.

4.8 Preference  of  type  of  E-resources 
As  far  as  the  preference  of  type  of  e-resources  is  concerned, the findings in Table 11 suggest that e-journals  we  highly  preferred  over  e-books,  e-dissertations  and  e-databases.  The  findings  fall  in  line  with  the  findings  in  Table  9  that  e-resources  are  mostly  accessed  for  the  purpose  of  research.  
It  can  be  seen  from  Table  12  that  the  open  access  journals  are  being  accessed  in  abundance  apart  from  the  journals  available  through  consortium  and  library  subscribed journals. It shows the awareness of respondents  about  the  benefits  of  open  access  journals. 
4.9 Frequency  of  Using  E-resources 
The  frequency  of  usage  of  e-resources  is  as  shown  in  Table  13.  The  weekly  usage  of  e-journals  (33  %)  is  more  than  e-books  (22  %)  and  e-databases  (20  %). The

4.10  Awareness  and  Frequency  of  Use  of  
E-databases 
Databases  are  becoming  very  important  tools  these  days  as  they  are  more  up  to  date,  and  can  be  accessed  anywhere crossing the geographical boundaries. Table 14  shows  that  the  respondents  are  not  highly  aware  of  e-databases though the subject databases are considered  to  be  very  important  sources  of  information. 
The  frequency  of  use  of  e-databases  is  as  shown  in  Table  15.  The  usability  of  e-resources  depends  upon  its awareness. It can be seen from the Table 17 that the  awareness of J-gate Agricultural & Biological Abstracts

and  CAB  Abstracts  is  high  and  so  is  their  usability  as  compared  to  other  e-databases  (Table  15).  As  per  the  information  gathered  from  the  library,  a  substantial  amount  has  been  spent  on  the  purchase  of  e-resources  (Rs  70,78,892  for  2015-16)  by  the  Library.  The  results  in  this  study  show  that  library  needs  to  take  steps  for  maximising  the  usage  of  e-databases.  
4.11  Awareness  and  Frequency  of  Use  of  
Consortium  and  Digital  Library  (DL)  Project 
The increased demand from the scholars for scholarly  literature  and  ever  increasing  prices  of  the  journals  accompanied with the shrinking budget has forced libraries  to think for the best alternatives like consortia. Therefore,  it is imperative to study the awareness and frequency of  use  of  consortia  and  digital  library  initiatives.  
Table  16  shows  that  the  respondents  are  aware  of  Consortium  of  e-Resources  in  Agriculture  (CeRA)  as  compared  to  other  resources.  
On further analysis of frequency of use of consortia  and digital library projects as shown in Table 17, it can  be  concluded  that  CeRA  usage  tops  among  the  users.  It

4.14 barriers  in  Using  E-Resources 
Table 20 shows that respondents find less number of  terminals as a major obstruction in the use of e-resources  but other barriers cannot be ignored. The ICT skills can  be  improved  among  the  library  staff  through  training.  More efforts should be put forward by the authorities for  providing better infrastructure and capable staff to maximise  the use of e-resources. Singh, Sharma & Negi17  also found

has  as  well  been  pointed  out  by  Bhat  &  Ganaie.14   It  is  astonishing  to  see  that  database  like  Agricat@eGranth  which is a catalog of 12 major libraries of ICAR institutes  and  SAUs  have  very  less  usage.  The  results  have  been  cross  verified  from  the  library.  The  university  library  does  not  maintain  the  log  statistics  of  the  usage  of  free  databases  except  CeRA.  It  has  been  found  that  CeRA  has  been  accessed  1,69,351  times  in  2015-16.  
4.12  Satisfaction  Regarding  Library  Services 
Libraries being the service institutions have always  been  at  the  forefront  in  catering  to  the  demands  of  the  users.  The  opinion  of  the  respondents  about  their  level  of  satisfaction  regarding  library  and  its  services  is  shown in Table 18. Most of the respondents are satisfied  with  library’s  routine  services  like  ‘library’s  working  hours’,  reading  room  facility’,  ‘book  lending‘,  etc.  and  rated  them  as  good.  It  validates  our  opinion  about  the  need  of  user  education  programme  and  improvement  of  consortia  service.  This  can  help  improve  the  usage  of  use  of  e-resources.  The  respondents  are  also  not  sure  about  inter  library  loan  facility. 
4.13   Level  of  Satisfaction  Regarding  E-Resources

The attitude of the library staff has also been found  helpful  by  the  respondents  as  shown  in  Table  22.  
4.16   Preference of Format and Comfort with          
  E-Resources 
Books have always been associated with the overall  development of society enlightening our mind, body and  soul. The  ICT  advancements  have  changed  the  way  one  thinks  and  communicate,  as  a  result  new  formats  of  reading  have  evolved.  
The  opinion  about  preference  of  format  and  their  comfort  with  e-resources  are  as  shown  in  Table  23.  
It can be assessed that the respondents have started  realising  the  potential  of  e-resources,  yet  they  feel  the  need  of  both  the  formats.  Majority  of  respondents  are  comfortable  with  the  use  of  e-resources  but  still  they

would  prefer  both  print  and  e-resources  alike  in  their  research  and  studies. 
4.17   Statement Analysis 
The  analysis  of  two  statement  ‘Use  of  e-Resources  has  eased  the  task  of  research’  and  ‘the  e-resources  can  replace  print  resources’  has  been  done  by  taking  suggestions from the respondents. To a statement, if the  use of e-resources has eased the task of research, majority  of the respondents agreed (54 %) while (28 %) strongly  agreed  by  the  statement  as  shown  in  table  24. 
The  63  %  respondents  partially  agree  with  the

statement that the e-resources can replace print resources  where as 16 % agree and 21 disagree with this statement.  Therefore,  it  is  right  to  say  that  the  e-resources  have  eased the task of research and can be a viable alternative  to  print  resources  in  future.  
5. DISCUSSIONS 
Move  towards  the  use  of  e-resources  has  enabled  the  scholar  community  to  search  information  easily.  The  users  now  don’t  have  to  look  up  into  the  piles  of  books  and  browse  page  by  page  as  their  predecessors  did.  The  present  study  found  that  respondents  visits  library  mostly  for  research  purpose.  The  respondents  are aware and well versed with web technology but still  need to understand the significance of library’s webpage  for  accessing  information  about  resources  and  services.  The  study  also  indicates  that  respondents  are  not  fully  aware  of  the  ‘library  education  programme/training’  as  well as its significance in achieving the academic targets.  Regarding the features of e-resources maximum number  of respondents observed ‘easy to download (54 %)’ and  ‘fast  searching  (50  %)’  as  significant  features  and  use  them  mostly  for  their  research  purpose  (61  %).  
It  has  been  observed  that  e-journals  (75  %)  and  e-books  (48  %)  are  the  most  preferred  e-resources  similar  to  the  findings  of  Francis6,  Kandpal,  et  al .,10  Bhat & Ganaie 14and contrary to the findings of Kumar.15 It  is  worthy  to  mention  that  national  and  international

  K AUR  & K AThURIA: AwARENESS AND  U SE OF  E-R ESOURCES 
agricultural  databases  are  great  sources  of  agricultural  information  and  libraries  are  spending  large  amount  of  money  on  e-resources,  but  it  has  been  found  that  the  awareness of e-databases is low among the respondents.  As per the usage statistics provided by the library, CAB  abstract  has  been  accessed  27,615  times,  FSTA  20,519  times, Business source elite 13,802 times and Indiastate.com  13,845 times. The library did not maintain the statistics  of  other  databases.  The  respondents  are  more  aware  of  CeRA  (73  %)  as  compared  to  KrishiPrabha  (35  %)  and  Agricat (26 %). The user statistics provided by the library  shows that CeRA has been accessed 1,69,351 times in the  year 2015-16. The usage of CeRA has increased since the  year 2011-12 when it was hit 50,428 times. The studies  by  Francis6   and  Bhat  &  Ganaie 
14 
  found  the  maximum  use of CeRA (87.14 % and 94.23 % respectively) by the  respondents.  The  statistics  of  KrishiPrabha  and Agricat  are  not  maintained  by  the  library. 
The  library  needs  to  address  the  infrastructural  problems  posing  hurdles  in  the  access  of  e-resources  such as lesser number of computer terminals, low speed  of  internet,  printing  problems  and  lack  of  training,  etc.,  Considering  these  issues,  more  efforts  should  be  put  forward  by  the  authorities  for  providing  better  infrastructure  and  trained  staff  for  the  maximum  usage  of e-resources. whereas in view of the satisfaction with  the  ‘staff  attitude’,  most  of  the  respondents  found  their  attitude  as  ‘helpful’.  
The status of the preference of ‘format of resources’  among  the  respondents  shows  that  large  number  of  respondents prefer ‘both print and electronic resources’  and  are  comfortable  in  using  electronic  resources. Thus  it  can  be  said  both  the  formats  complement  each  other.  As  far  as  the  statements  ‘use  of  e-resources  has  eased  the  task  of  research’  and  ‘e-resources  can  replace  print  resources’ are concerned, it has been examined that large  number of respondents ‘agree’ with the first statement and  ‘partially  agree’  with  the  second  statement.  This  shows  that  the  traditional  (print)  resources  will  continue  to  be  necessary components of the academic community. Though  e-resources have started to impact the older generation as  well as the young minds, but, e-resources are still in its  infancy stage. Thus in the light of foregoing discussion,  library professionals should provide the blend of traditional  as well as technological innovations which will definitely  increase  the  use  of  library  and  its  services. 
6. CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDA tIONS 
Libraries are home to scholars and to maintain pace  with the net savvy generation, the libraries need to become  dynamic  in  nature  allowing  scholars  to  access  variety  of  web  resources  and  services  that  are  place  and  time  independent. E-resources in special libraries are making  a significant growth as part of library collection but it is  also true that more efforts are needed to make the users  aware regarding the potential of electronic resources and  the  benefits  of  them.  To  keep  pace  with  the  evolving  
society, libraries and information centres need to update  their  resources  and  services  in  a  new  ‘avataar’.  
On  the  basis  of  data  analysis  and  findings,  the  following recommendations have been made for optimum  utilisation and awareness of e-resources in the university  library.  
(a) Training  to  the  staff  in  terms  of  adequate  skills  
should  be  given  on  regular  intervals. 
(b) It  should  be  mandatory  for  every  student  to  attend  
the  user  education  programme/training  provided  by  
the  library. 
(c) Consortia  services  need  to  be  addressed  accurately  
to  maximise  the  use  of  e-resources  in  the  library. (d) Advocacy  of  various  e-resources  such  as  
KrishiPrabha, Agricat@eGranth need to be executed  
appropriately. 
(e)  Librarians should volunteer with the idea of implementing  
interactive media by extended applications of web 2.0  
to libraries with enhanced services to facilitate two  
way  interactions  between  users  and  professionals.  (f) A  paper  on  LIS  regarding  library  resources  and  
services  should  be  mandatory  for  all  the  courses  
and  for  all  the  classes. 
(g) Infrastructural  needs  should  be  taken  care  off.
