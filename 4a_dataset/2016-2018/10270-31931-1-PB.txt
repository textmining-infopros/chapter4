Electronic resources are becoming an integral part of the modern life and of the educational prospect, especially  the higher education prospect. Students of all age group, house wife’s, technician and professionals of all community  like academicians, business, medical professionals, lawyers, technicians are highly dependent on e-resources. Govt.  of India is also playing key role in support of e-resources, with its special scheme of subsidised rates for subscribing  e-resources and internet usage. Accessibility and use of e-resources by the medical, dental and paramedical science  professionals in the state of Karnataka is studied. It includes use of e-resources, use of various types of e-resources,  Frequency of access to internet, Information searching pattern, Use of e-databases subscribed by the library, Purpose  of use, Problem faced while accessing information resources through online search mode. 
Key Words: E-resources, online resources, internet, CD-ROM database, medical science professionals 
1.  IntRoDUctIon 
Medical  Science  is  important  for  improvement  of  human  life,  lifespan  and  quality  of  human  life.  It  helps  prevent  human  suffering  and  also  cures  the  diseases  that  are  the  result  of  advancing  civilisation.  It  helps  to  develop  new  drugs,  new  techniques  and  new  equipment  to  study,  analyse  and  cure  the  diseases. 
Dentists restore and maintain dental health by diagnosing  and treating, operating on, or prescribing for any disease,  pain,  injury,  deformity  or  physical  condition  of  the  oral  and maxillofacial area. Under the supervision of a dentist,  dental  hygienists  provide  treatment  to  prevent  cavities  and  gum  diseases. 
Paramedical  Science  is  the  backbone  for  medical  sciences because right diagnosis of diseases is necessary  to  prevent  fatal  diseases.  Thus,  Medical  Science  will  be  paralysed  without  paramedical  science.  Paramedical  professionals  supplement  the  work  of  doctors  (medical  professionals) in specialised areas for facilitating diagnosis,  treatment or therapy. Paramedical Personnel or Paramedics  health-care  workers  who  provide  clinical  services  to  patients  under  the  supervision  of  a  doctor.  
Medical, dental and paramedical information should  be accessible, authoritative, reliable, accurate and timely.  Due  to  the  needs  of  medical,  dental  and  paramedical  professionals for high quality information, medical, dental and  paramedical libraries have been early adopters of electronic  resources  to  provide  information  and  services. 
E-resources  have  exploded  in  popularity  and  use.  They  can  and  do  enable  innovation  in  teaching  and  they  increase  timeliness  in  research  as  well  as  increase  discovery  and  creation  of  new  field  of  enquiry.

There  are  49  Medical  Colleges  in  Karnataka  out  of  which 18 are Governments owned and 31 are Private one.  10  medical  colleges  in  Karnataka  out  of  49  are  having  Deemed  University  status,  one  is  state-owned  and  the  remaining  9  are  managed  by  private  trusts.  Among  the  18  government  medical  colleges  in  Karnataka  there  are  8  offering  only  PG  courses  and  no  MBBS.  
There are 44 Dental Colleges in Karnataka Governments  out of which 2 are Governments owned and 42 are managed by  private trusts which churn out around 2,960 dentists every year.  There  are  306  Paramedical  Colleges  in  Karnataka. 
An attempt has been made to determine the present  status and use of electronic resources (e-resources) in the  State  of  Karnataka  by  students  and  faculty  members  of  medical, dental and paramedical college libraries. Students  and Faculty are more accomplished and innovative in the  work  force,  information  plays  vital  role,  for  accessing  information and keeping abreast with the new developments,  and  internet  is  becoming  an  essential  human  need  with  all  its  facets.

that  the  Medical  education  popularised  only  after  the  independence  of  the  country.  It  is  found  that  majority  of  the  colleges  under  the  study  have  e-information  resources,  e-databases. Almost  all  colleges  under  study  are  also  becoming  members  of  a  consortium.  
Emmanuel2, et al. in his study find out whether the  undergraduate students in the College of Health Sciences  in  Delta  State  University  are  aware  of  and  fully  utilise  the  medical  databases  and  other  online  information  resources  within  and  outside  the  medical  library.

  in  his  study  found  that  faculty  had  high  awareness  of  the  electronic  resources  made  available  by  the  MSL  but  low  use  of  MSL-specific  resources  supporting  the  suggested  problem  of  underutilisation.  Many  respondents  felt  that  e-resources  were  important,  and,  though  many  felt  that  they  were  competent  users,  83% were self-taught and many still expressed a need for  training.  Over  60%  felt  that  a  workshop  with  a  hands- on  component  was  the  preferred  format  for  training.  It  was  recommended  that  there  be  greater  promotion  of  the  library's  e-resources. 
Asemi4  in  case study of Medical Sciences University  of  Isfahan  (MUI),  Iran  showed  that  all  the  respondents  used the internet frequently because all faculties had an  internet connection. It was revealed that the researchers  of the university were getting quality health information  and patient care through the Internet. 55% of respondents  searched  for  scientific  health  information  through  the  Internet  because  the  university  library  provided  access  to  databases  and  online  journals  students  and  staff. 
Thanuskodi5   in  his  study  shows  that  less  than  two  hours of access to internet takes the first order reporting  among  the  medical  professionals  of  Tamil  Nadu. About  two  to  three  hours  of  access  to  internet  the  second,  3-4  hours of access to internet the third, 4-5 hours of access  to  internet  the  fourth  and  above  5  hours  of  access  to  internet  the  last.  Study  reveals  that  respondents  have  high  problems  in  accessing  e-resources  in  terms  of  virus,  difficulty  in  using  digital  resources  due  to  lack  of  Information  Technology  (IT)  knowledge  and  limited  access  to  computers.  The  respondents  have  moderate  problems  in  accessing  relevant  information  and  taking  long  time  to  view.  The  respondents  have  low  problems  in accessing towards slow accessibility, lack of time and  too  much  information  retrieved. 
Singh  &  Gill6   found  that  94%  respondents  are  aware and only 6% respondents are not aware about the  availability  of  e-journals.  The  study  found  that  38.5%  respondents  accessing  e-journals  facility  for  the  last  4  years, followed by 18.3% less than one year. The survey  revealed  that  55%  respondents  have  limited  access  to  terminals  which  is  a  major  problem  for  accessing  e-journals,  followed  by  51%  downloading,  followed  by  40%  slow  speed. 
Bhat & Mudhol7  in his study shows that the Medical  faculty  members  and  students’  attitudes  seem  to  be  very  positive  towards  e-resources  for  their  study  and  
research  and  the  role  of  libraries  as  gateway  to  provide  assistance in accessing these resources. Faculty members  and  students  heavily  depend  on  e-resources  for  their  required  information  and  to  keep  themselves  up-to-date  in  their  subject  area.

The following objectives are evolved for the purpose  of  the  present  study  to: 
(a) Study the respondents’ place of access and methods  
of  search 
(b) Examine  the  respondents’  duration  and  quantum  of  
time  utilisation  in  search  of  medical,  dental  and  
paramedical  information 
(c) Study the respondents’ frequency of utilising medical,  
dental  and  paramedical  information 
(d) Analyse  the  respondents’  extent  of  access  to  
e-resources 
(e) Examine  the  respondents’  purpose  of  gathering  
e-resources 
(f) Study the respondents’ problems faced while accessing  
the  e-resources 
(g) Suggest the suitable methods to increase the electronic  
resource use among medical, dental and paramedical  
professionals.  
5.  MEthoDoLogy 
The questionnaire tool was used for collecting the data  from the faculty members and students of medical, dental  and paramedical science professionals in Karnataka State.  A  total  number  of  300  questionnaires  were  distributed  among the faculty members and students of medical, dental  and  paramedical  science  professionals.  This  constitutes  76.66%  (230/300)  of  the  total  response.  
The  present  study,  in  its  survey  of  Medical,  Dental  and  Paramedical  Science  Professionals  about  the  use  of  e-resources, has the sample of 300 (100 Faculty Members  and  130  UG  Students,  70  PG  Students)  respondents,  selected  from  Karnataka  State  Medical,  Dental  and  Paramedical  College  libraries.  The  investigator  could  collect questionnaires from only 230 out of 300 medical,  dental  and  paramedical  science  faculty  members  and  students  among.

Moreover, infrastructure and training, programmes are  essential for better use of electronic resources in medical,  dental  and  paramedical  college/university  libraries  of  Karnataka state. The study showed that the availability of  e-resources in the college university is almost sufficient  for  all  the  existing  disciplines.  In  order  to  improve  theeffective  use  of  electronic  resources,  in  Karnataka  state medical, dental and paramedical college/university  libraries, a number of suggestions made are as follows: (a) The  college/university  management  should  provide  
funds  for  subscription  to  more  electronic  primary  
and  secondary  sources    
(b) Different levels of user education programmes should  
be  arranged  for  medical,  dental  and  paramedical  
professionals  
(c) Medical, Dental and Paramedical education curricula  
should be revised at the national level to accommodate  
the integration of information literacy and the use of  
e-library, either as embedded or standalone courses.  
This is in recognition of the changes in technology,  
especially, in managing medical, dental and paramedical  
information  
(d) User  training  is  essential  for  the  better  use  of  
electronic  resources  in  the  library  since  a  good  
number  of  professionals  are  searching  electronic  
literature  on  their  own 
(e) Electronic resources users should be taught about advanced  
search strategies and the use of controlled vocabulary  
to  make  electronic  search  process  much  easier

(f) The  library  staff  should  also  identify  the  non-users  
of  electronic  resources  and  proper  steps  should  be  
taken  to  convert  them  into  potential  users  of  the  
resources  
(g) Furthermore, since users are experiencing problems  
in gathering information, the most suitable measures  
should be taken to overcome this, such as increasing  
the  number  of  terminals  and  printers 
(h) There  is  the  need  for  the  institutional  governing  
body to integrate adequate information (technology)  
literacy content into the curriculum for professionals  
in  the  college/university 
(i) The library staff should cooperate with the users and  
help  them  in  overcoming  the  technical  difficulties  
faced  while  using  e-resources.  
If such actions as outlined above are taken, then the  situation regarding e-resources information in Karnataka  State medical, dental and paramedical college/university  libraries  would  improve  substantially.  
8.    c oncLUSIonS 
The  e-resources  have  become  the  vital  part  of  the  every  kind  of  library.  Print  format  of  documents  are  being changed into electronic form. E-Books, E-Journals,  E-Thesis,  Online  Databases,  etc.  have  become  the  need  of  the  library  and  several  advantages  over  the  print  counterparts.  The  present  study  was  conducted  on  the  use  of  e-resources  by  medical,  dental  and  paramedical  professionals  of  Karnataka  State  in  college/university  libraries.  It  indicates  that  e-resources  have  played  a  major  role  in  information  dissemination  process.  
This  study  showed  that  the  uses  of  e-resources  are  very  common  among  the  professionals  of  medical,  dental  and  paramedical  college/university  libraries  of  Karnataka State. It also showed that majority of medical  and dental professionals followed by medical technology

professionals are dependent on e-resources to get desired  and  relevant  information.  It  was  however,  revealed  that  practical uses of e-resources are not worth in comparison  to  investments  made  in  acquiring  these  resources.  The  study  will  be  beneficial  for  the  libraries  to  know  the  needs  of  users  for  better  use  of  e-resources  service  provided  by  medical,  dental  and  paramedical  college/ university  libraries.
