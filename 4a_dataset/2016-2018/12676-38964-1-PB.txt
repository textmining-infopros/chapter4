Nowadays, mobile technology seems to become integral part of our life. People with different careers have  begun to use it in their jobs. This research aims to identify infuential factors in mobile technology adoption at library  context. To this end, a conceptual model was presented based on an integrated model of technology acceptance  model (TAM) and technology organisation and environment (TOE) model. A researcher-made questionnaire was  distributed among 120 academic librarians. Seven Factor out of the integrated model of TAM and TOE were chosen  to investigate their infuence on mobile technology adoption. The results of the study suggest that the proposed model  (integrated model of TAM and TOE) is a favourable one to identify the infuential factors in mobile technology  adoption at library context. In addition, regression analysis indicated that out of these seven factor, perceived ease  of use, perceived usefulness, compatibility, relative advantage and organisational competency are determinant factors  in adopting mobile technology-based library services among academic librarians.  
Keywords: Academic librarians; Mobile technology adoption; Technology acceptance model  
1.  InTroDucTIon  
The world appears to be on the edge of the revolutionary  time  of  mobile  technology  use  in  higher  education  in  general  and  libraries  in  particular.  Communication  technology  provided  considerable  access  to  information  and  this  matter  is  challenging  knowledge  worker  to  redesign their services adopting the technical changes. The  internet  and  databases  of  libraries  and  universities  have  facilitated  information  finding.  Library  and  Information  centers  are  no  more  merely  care  use  of  books1.  Today,  libraries, particularly academic libraries should function in  a user focused, technology based environment, providing  personalised  value  added  facilities,  since  the  academic  society  heavily  depends  on  information  and  using  this  information and communication technology in academic  libraries  can  lead  to  improve  academic  society  and  university  students’  information  level  by  having  fast  and  less  expensive  access  to  scientific  resources.  As  Abdekhoda2, et  al.  notes  ‘recently,  studies  to  recognise  and  forecast  human  factors  and  subjects  related  to  technology  application  have  been  gradually  recognised.  Hence, knowledge worker need to be aware of technical  changes, peer forward, and prepare for the upcoming of  library mobile communication. They must be commensurate  with  this  movement  and  participate  themselves  into  the  mobile dominion if they want to provide improved user  services3. 
This  study  was  conducted  to  identify  influential

factors  on  attitude  toward  mobile  technology  adoption  by presenting a conceptual model, which is based on the  integration of classical models of technology organisation  and environment (TOE) and technology acceptance model  (TAM). Effective factors in the adoption and perception  of  mobile  technology  by  academic  librarians  will  be  addressed  in  this  research.      
2.  HypoTHeSeS 
Several theoretical models have been proposed so far  by  various  scholars  and  researchers  who  have  focused  on  identifying  factors  which  influence  user  acceptance  behaviour. TAM and TOE models have received considerable  attention  over  the  last  two  decade.  TAM  introduced  by  Davis and his colleagues, according to him a real system  usage  is  determined  by  behaviour  intention  which  is  in  turn  together  determined  by  perceived  usefulness  (PU)  and  perceived  ease  of  use  (PEOU).  PU  is  the  extent  to  which  a  person  accept  that  applying  technology  will  improve his/her job performance and PEOU is the extent  to  which  a  person  trusts  that  adopting  new  application  will be free of effort4. The main components of this model  include, PU, PEOU, attitude and usage. The TAM model  proposes that PEOU influences PU, because information  systems  that  are  easy  to  use  can  be  more  suitable.  The  following  two  hypotheses  were  put  forth  based  on  this  model  regarding  PU  and  PEOU:  
H1:  There is a positive relationship between PU and attitude  
toward mobile technology adoption. 
H2:  There is a positive association between PEOU and attitude  
toward mobile technology adoption.

tween organisational competency and PEOU.  H12:  There is a direct relationship between management sup - 
port and PEOU.  
Summary of hypotheses and proposed integrated model is  illustrated in Fig. 1.                                                                                                     
                        
3.  MeTHoDoLogy  
In this cross-sectional study with analytical approach, the  participants  were  134  academic  librarian  working  at  Tabriz  University,  Tabriz  University  of  Medical  Sciences,  research  centers  and  hospitals  that  were  chosen  based  on  convenient  sampling. A developed questionnaire based on literature was  used  as  the  method  of  data  collection17-21.  The  face  validity  of the questionnaire was approved by 10 professors of Tabriz  University of Medical Sciences and reliability analysis showed  Cronbach’s of α= 0.7 proving the reliability of data collection  instrument. As well as the face validity, the CVR and CVI are  also calculated.  The items of the questionnaire were framed  on fve point Likert scale in which; ‘Strongly agree’, ‘Agree’,  ‘Natural’,  ‘Disagree’,  ‘Strongly  disagree’  were  assigned  to  test the items. From 134 questionnaire distributed, 127 were  returned completed. 7 questionnaire out of 127  questionnaire  considered  inappropriate  for  analysis  because  of  presenting  wrong information or partially flled out questions.  In order  to  investigate  the  correlation  coeffcient  of  the  variable,  a  correlation analysis and regression analysis were carried out  for the data. Furthermore, the conceptual model was expanded  and tested by using AMOS16.0. To end, authorised conceptual  model was presented. Table 1 indicates the survey questions  used to measure the constructs of TAM -TOE. 
4.   r eSuLTS       
As  it  is  mentioned  before,  the  participants  of  the  study  were  134  librarians  working  at  Tabriz  University,  Tabriz  University of Medical Sciences, research centers and hospitals.  
TOE model on the other hand, was developed by Tornatzky  LG, Fleischer M, Chakrabarti AK. Processes of technological  innovation. Lexington books; 1990. which explains the level  of  information  system  adoption  and  information  technology  products.  This  model  is  extensively  used  for  information  technology adoption uses three main contexts; technological,  organisational, and environmental context and affecting new  technology implementation. Relative advantage, compatibility  and  complexity,  are  categorised  under  technology  context.  Relative  advantage  means    the  grade  to  which  a  technical  factor is supposed as providing better beneft for organisations.  Several  studies  have  indicated  valid  role  of  compatibility  in  PU and PEOU. Peng10, et al.  believes that compatibility takes  into account whether existing values, behavioural patterns, and  experiences of a business and its workers are in the reconcilability  of a new innovation. Calisir11, et al.  defnes compatibility as   the degree to which the innovation is perceived to be consistent  with the potential users’ existing values, previous experiences  and  requirements  .  Complexity  is  defned  as  the  perceived  degree  of  diffculty  of  understanding  and  using  a  system.  Organisational competency, management support, and training  and  education  are  categorised  as  the  organisational  context.  Organisational  competency  or  organisational  readiness  is  described by Tan12, et al.  as ‘managers’ attitude and evaluation  of the degree to which they believe that their organisation has  the responsiveness, possessions, and governance’ to implement  an information technology. Researches on Management support  indicated    its  direct  effect  on  PU  and  PEOU  in  adoption  of  information  technologies.  It  is  defned  by  Salwani15,  et  al. as  the  perceptions  and  commitment  of  top  managers  on  the  effectiveness  of  technical  innovation  in  generating  values  for  the  organisation.  Finally  environmental  contexts  contain  two  variables  as  competitive  pressure  and  trading  partner.  The former is defned by Zhu and Kraemer16  as the degree of  pressure that the organisation feels from opponents within the  business. However, environmental context  
is not investigated in this research.  
By integrating two models (TAM and  
TOE), to address the main questions of the  
study the following hypotheses were sug- 
gested.  
H3:  There is a direct relationship between  
relative advantages and PU.  
H4:  There is a direct relationship between  
compatibility and PU.  
H5:  There is a direct relationship between  
complexity and PU.  
H6:  There is a direct relationship between  
relative advantages and PEOU. 
H7:  There is a direct relationship between  
compatibility and PEOU. 
H8:  There is a direct relationship between  
complexity and PEOU. 
H9:  There is a direct relationship between  
organisational competency and PU. 
H10:  There is a direct relationship between  
management support and PU.

However, there is a negative relationship between Complexity  and  relative  advantage  as  technological  factors.  Regarding  organisational  determinants,  there  is  positive  and  signifcant  association  among  management  support  and  PU,  PEOU,  attitude,  compatibility,  and  relative  advantage.  Finally,  there  is  direct  and  signifcant  relationship  between  organisational  competency  and  PU,  PEOU,  attitude,  compatibility,  relative  advantage  and  management  support.  Interestingly  enough,  there is negative association between complexity and relative  advantage.  
274 
The results of regression analysis are shown in Fig.  2. Ac - cording to Fig. 2, PU and PEOU have positive and signifcant  effect on attitude toward mobile technology adoption (depen- dent variable), (β= .62, p-value≤ 0.01; β= .56, p-value≤ 0.01).  Regarding  technology  factors,  relative  advantage  showed  to  have positive and signifcant effect on PEOU (β=.24, p-value≤  0.01) but no signifcant effect on PU (β=.12, p-value ≥ 0.05)  was found. Compatibility suggested a positive and strong effect  on both PU and PEOU (β=.66, p-value≤ 0.01, β= .54, p-value≤  0.01 respectively). Regarding complexity, no association was

found between this variable and all other variables and it was  even negative in case of relative advantage. So this variable is  ignored and eliminated from the fnal proposed model.  
Concerning  Organisational  context  determinants,  organisational  competency  indicated  a  positive  though  not  so  much  signifcant  effect  on  both  PU  and  PEOU.  (β=.  26,  p-value ≤ 0.05, β=. 17, p-value ≤ 0.05, respectively). Finally,  management support showed a positive and strong effect on  PEOU (β=.36, p-value ≤ 0.01). However, it appeared to have  no signifcant effect on PU (β=.15, p-value ≥ 0.05) 
5.  DIScuSSIonS 
As  data  analysis  indicated,  the  variables  of  TAM  (i.e.  PU and PEOU) and variables of TOE including technological  context  factors  (i.e.  relative  advantage,  compatibility,  and  complexity), organisational context factors (i.e. organisational  competency  and  management  support)  are  important  determinants to affect librarians’ attitude toward implementing  mobile technology in library environment.  
Concerning H1, the fndings showed there is a considerable  and direct association between PU and attitude toward mobile  technology  adoption  (β=  .62,  p-value≤  0.01).  So  H1   was  supported. The fndings also revealed that PEOU has direct and  signifcant effect on attitude (β=.56, p-value≤ 0.01). So, H2 was  accepted. In similar vein, Tung concluded that ‘compatibility’,  PU,  PEOU,  and  ‘trust’  all  have  strong  direct  infuence  on  ‘behavioural intention’22. These fndings are in line with other  studies already done in the feld like2, 7, 9, 23, 24.   
The  literature  indicated  positive  and  signifcant  effect  of relative advantage on both PU and PEOU, the researchers  implied that the users would be more delighted to implement  mobile technology at their work if it had some sort of relative  advantage2,6,17,25-27.  Concerning  this  association,  H6   was  supported in this study. Thus there is a positive relationship  between relative advantage and PEOU (β=.24, p-value≤ 0.01)  whereas H3  was rejected since the standard coeffcient was .12  and p-value ≥ 0.05.   
Compatibility was another variable regarding technological  context which suggested to have positive and signifcant effect  on both PU and PEOU (β=.66, p-value≤ 0.01; β=.54, p-value≤  0.01  respectively).  Thus, H4   and  H7   both  supported  in  this  study.    Some  studies  that  their  fndings  are  in  line  with  this  study28,9.  
The Fifth and eights hypotheses were put forth to fnd out  whether  there  is  a  positive  association  between  complexity  and PU and PEOU as variables a TAM model. Some studies  carried out by some researchers in order to fnd any possible  relationship.  They  came  to  this  conclusion  that  association  among them is negative and direct which implies that the more  the mobile technology services become complicated, the less  they are used by the people2,23-25,29,30. This research showed that  there is no association among them. Similarly, Wu has noted  that  complicatedness  had  no  indirect  effect  on  Electronic  Customer Relationship Management (E-CRM) acceptance. So  no regression analysis can be done to see which one infuences  the  other  one.  Thus,  H5   and  H8   were  both  rejected  and  complexity is eliminated from the proposed model.  
The  organisational  readiness  like  being  equipped  with  
suffcient technological resources showed to have signifcant  effect on successful use of a particular technology. Both H9  and  H11  were supported in this research. The former says there is  a positive association between organisational competency and  PU (β=. 26, p-value ≤ 0.05). The latter claims this relationship  is  also  positive  between  organisational  competency  and  perceived ease of use. (β=. 17, p-value ≤ 0.05). Gangwar6  also  reported this in the literature. 
Although the literature indicated a signifcant association  between  management  support  and  PU  as  in17,26,31,  who  reported that PU, PEOU, and management commitment have  considerable  effect  on  doctors’  attitudes  toward  Electronic  Medical Records’ implementation, the results of this study are  the  opposite  way  around  showing  that  management  support  does  not  have  a  signifcant  effect  on  perceived  usefulness  (β=. 15, p-value ≥ 0.05). So H10  was rejected. However,  H12 was supported in this study since the standard coeffcient was  .36 and p-value≤ 0.01, hence there is signifcant and positive  relationship  between  management  support  and  PEOU.  This  fnding is in line with what have been achieved by Kowitlawakul  and Gangwar. 
6.    c oncLuSIonS 
The  general  aim  of  this  survey  was  to  fnd  out  which  factors infuence librarians’ attitudes toward mobile technology  adoption at libraries. In so doing, an integrated model of TOE  and TAM was offered, extended and tested by the researcher  and it is proved to be an appropriate model. The results of the  study identifed fve determinants including relative advantage,  compatibility, organisational competency, with PU and PEOU  as mediating variables. The regression analysis suggested that  among  these  factors,  compatibility  was  the  most  infuential  one on PU and PEOU, compared with Management support,  organisational competency, and relative advantage. Thus, it’s  really important to consider these factors at libraries since they  affect  librarians’  attitudes  toward  using  mobile  technology- based services. 
6.1   r ecommendations  for  Further research  
The comparison between the fndings of this research with  other related researches suggests that the results vary when the  participants are different; so this study can be replicated in other  contexts  with  other  participants  and  in-depth  investigation  might provide the scholars and researchers with lots of insights  and the reasons behind such different fndings.  
6.2  Limitations  of  the research 
Due  to  the  sampling  type  of  this  research  (convenient  sampling) in which available academic librarians are chosen,  it seems that for such descriptive studies more participants are  needed  to  conduct  the  research  more  effectively  and  to  get  more confdent results.  
6.3   e thics  statement 
Different ethical aspects of present research were approved  by the Ethics Council of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences  (IR.TBZMED.REC.1395.96126 (and all the participants signed  the consent form of the research.
