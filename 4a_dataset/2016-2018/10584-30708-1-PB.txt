ABSTRACT 
The content of Library and Information Science (LIS) curriculum has drastically evolved in the recent decades.  With the penetration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), technological components have becomes  the main focus of the discipline. The present paper analyses the ICT contents of postgraduate degree courses in  select universities across India. It also analyses the expectation of the professionals with regard to course content  and relevancy of the curriculum in the contemporary times. The present study system suggests that maintaining  homogeneity and standardised curriculum will help in keeping Indian syllabi at par with international standards. 
Keywords: Information  communication  technology  competencies,  LIS  curriculum,  universities,  library  
professionals  
1.  INTRODUCTION  
The  objective  of  any  curriculum  is  essentially,  to  impart knowledge and skill-sets to students. LIS curriculum  is  no  different  from  other  subjects.  Varalakshmi1 stated  that  LIS  curriculum  is  designed  in  a  manner  entailed,  encompassing all nuances of LIS profession in academia  outlook of the student. Ganaie2  reported that curriculum is  designed to prepare the students to assimilate a working  knowledge about the areas and acquire skills relevant in  field. Among other skills, in Internet era and continuously  evolving technology, ICT has becomes integral part of LIS  curriculum.  The  ICT  component  of  the  LIS  curriculum  outlines  specifically  what  people  need  to  do,  where  people  need  to  be  effective  in  their  roles  and  establish  how  their  roles  could  relate  to  university  library  goals.  The study shows that post graduate degree is many of 1,  2 or 5 years of duration in most universities. This paper  examines the ICT component in Masters Courses across  selected 37 LIS departments of universities/institutes and  level of compliance with UGC model curriculum 20013.  Out  of  all  the  departments  offering  Master’s  degree  courses,  18  offer  1-year,  20  offer  2-years  postgraduate   degree  and  02  are  offering  5-years  integrated  course. 
2.  LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Momentous  literature  is  available  in  reference  to  ICT  course  contents  in  LIS  curriculum.  Ranganathan4  stated that cultivation of man's  ability  and  skills should  go  on  throughout  life  and  this  can  be  achieved  through  education.  Aina5,  Sharma6   and  Kavulya

studies  on  LIS  curriculum  find  that  there  is  a  gap  in  professional  competencies  versus  LIS  teaching.  It  was  observed that though the relevance of ICT was stressed,  only  a  few  institutions  had  incorporated  ICT  in  their  syllabus. Since it is been identified that library staff need  to  develop  there  ICT  competencies  to  perform  better  in  this  modern  time,  many  researches  have  come-up  with  various  possible  suggestions  for  corrective  measures  to  be  taken  in  this  regard.  Karisiddappa8   discussed  the  LIS  education  scenario  in  the  developing  countries  and  stressed  the  need  for  model  curriculum  to  impart  ICT  competent workforce. The adoption of modular approach  is a way of convergence of the present and future needs  of a dynamic curriculum. Mondal9  and Singh 
10 
 explained  that the LIS curriculum required constant monitoring and  a statutory body like ALA to accredit programs according  to international standards. The LIS professionals in Indian  Universities  lack  ICT  skills  and  encounter  problems  in  the job market. Susan11   in  her  research  study  concluded  that  most  of  the  library  professionals  do  not  have  an  optimistic  approach  towards  the  application  of  ICT  based services in libraries. This may be mainly because  of  lack  of  adequate  ICT  infrastructure  in  university  libraries.  Majority  of  the  professionals  irrespective  of  their age, experience or qualifications had suggested the  need  for  more  ICT  oriented  topics  in  the  curriculum.  It  was  further  recommended  that  multi-media  laboratories  should be made compulsory in universities that offer LIS  courses. Ganaie2, Mahmood12, opines that remodelling of  LIS  curriculum  has  to  be  done  by  planning  and  proper  integration  of  ICT  into  library  education.  Pradhan13,

Rukwaro  &  Bii14,  concluded  that  LIS  programs  have  reviewed  their  curricula  in  light  of  the  needs  of  society  and the market but continued reviews are needed to meet  future  needs.  They  all  recommend  fine  tuning  of  the  curriculum  with  ICT  to  meet  the  market  needs. 
3.  OBJECTIVES  OF THE  STUDY 
The  main  objectives  of  the  study  are: 
(a)   h olistic review and analyses of ICT course contents  
of postgrduate degree curriculum incorporated in LIS  
courses  across  select  37  LIS  departments  in  India (b) Evaluate level of compliance to UGC model curriculum  
2001,  and  
(c) Scrutinising level of homogeneity prevalent in ICT  
course  content  across  select  37  LIS  departments. 
4.  RESEARCH  METHODLOGY 
The methodology adopted to evaluate the curriculum  was  on  basis  of  questionnaires  and  e-mails  sent  to  selected  universities.  The  clarifications  as  and  when  desired  and  required  were  sorted  out  by  establishing  contact  via  e-mail  and  telephonically.  Efforts  were  also  made  to  complete  the  data  from  other  sources  such  as  website  of  respective  university  wherever  incomplete  data  was  received. 
The research is restricted to select number of universities  offering  the  pattern  of  LIS  education  spread  across  in  India.  The  selected  universities  from  each  region,  i.e.,  East,  West,  North  and  South  of  India  represent  the  different  regions  of  the  country.  An  insight  into  Master’s  degree  courses  offered  by  LIS  departments  and  subsequent  analysis  comprise  scope  covered  under  this  study.

5.  FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS  
5.1  Master’s  Course-One Year 
Out  of  the  37  departments,  49%  were  conducting  one-year  MLISc  course.  The  papers  being  offered  at  post-graduate level (semester-wise) and the topics covered  for  ICT  related  course  contents  (topic-wise)  are  shown  in  Table  1  and  Table  2  respectively.  It  is  evident  from  Table-1  that  LIS  departments  offering  Masters  Course  had followed a multi facted course structure comprising  conventional  along  with  emerging  topics  such  as  ‘ICT  basics’  and  ‘Digital  Library  Systems’.  It  was  observed  that  there  exists  difference  in  paper’s  nomenclature  in  addition  to  the  difference  in  number  of  topics  and  papers  being  taught  in  various  LIS  departments.  Most  departments  have  merely  re-labeled  the  nomenclature  of  the  papers.  
Table  1,  analyses  shows  that  the  main  paper  taught  under  the  scope  of  study  is  ‘Information  and  communication technology (Theory & Practice)’. On the  
Table 1. Papers at master’s level-1 year

basis  of  nomenclature,  it  was  revealed  that  18  papers  were  taken  up  in  these  18  departments.  The  minimum  number  of  papers  being  taught  is  01  and  maximum  are  04,  which  lead  to  following  observations: 
(a) 89%  department  follows  semester  system  while  
11.11%  follows  annual  system. 
(b) 22%  departments  teach  ICT  related  paper  in  1st 
semester  only  with  theory  and  practice  as  separate  
papers.  
(c) 22%  departments  had  taken  classes  in  2nd   semester  
only  wherein  75%  departments  conduct  theory  and  
practice  as  separate  papers  while  25%  department  
conduct  theory  and  practice  as  combined  paper. (d) Wherever semester system is followed,  22% departments  
teach  papers  in  1st  semester  only  with  theory  and  
practice  as  separate  papers. 
(e) Overall, 28% departments conducted combined classes  
of  both  theory  and  practice  as  a  single  paper. (f) 72% departments teach theory and practice as separate  
papers.

7.  OBSERVATIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS 
The  survey  had  revealed  varied  results.  It  could  be  inferred  that  existing  ICT  content  being  prevalent  in  various  LIS  curriculum  are  not  standardised.  It  was  further  observed  that  some  of  the  departments  were  not  in  compliance  with  the  UGC  Model  curriculum  2001  as  far  as  ICT  course  contents  are  concerned.  They  merely  tweaked,  re-devised  and  modified  their  syllabus in line with the local scenario and demands. In  the  current  scenario,  the  UGC  Model  Curriculum  2001  could be construed as outdated and deficient to the rapid  changes  in  ICT  technologies  prevalent  in  the  present  environment.  It  is  particularly  so  due  to  the  enormous  gap  in  time  around  fifteen  years  (from  2001  to  2015).  Therefore,  the  curriculum  requires  urgent  revision  by

accommodating, incorporating and pruning the emerging  trends  and  management  aspects.  The  curriculum  should  be  vibrant  enough  to  concentrate  more  on  upcoming  and  newer  technologies  and  advancements  in  the  field  of  LIS  with  the  sole  focus  on  practical  components

viz, 	 mobile 	 applications 	 in 	 libraries, 	 electronic 	 audit 	 of 	 information,  etc. 
It  is  opined  that  some  topics  such  as  historical  background  and  development  of  computers,  outdated  languages  could  be  considered  for  deletion  in  specific  areas. Further it is also suggested that other topics such  as wireless sensor networks, cloud computing and security,  web  entrepreneurship,  content  delivery  technologies  for  creative  social  media  and  convergence,  Cyber-Physical  systems (CPS) could be included in the LIS syllabi. The  following  teaching  methods  could  also  be  considered: (a) Lectures  (2  hours  for  4  days  per  week),  (b) Practical  exercises  (4  hours  for  4  days  per  week),  (c) Field  work  (05  hours  for  02  days  per  week),  and  (d) Work in a library as intern apprentice while pursuing  
LIS  courses.  
Taking into account the competence of the students,  present  ICT  environment  and  existing  infrastructural  facilities in the LIS departments and libraries, the revision  of syllabus every five years would be beneficial for both  theory and practical classes. There is urgent requirement  that papers approved by the LIS departments in curriculum  must be uniform while conforming to standards lay down  worldwide  in  field  of  LIS.  This,  by  itself,  could  raise  the  levels  of  LIS  professionals  and  attain  the  expertise  and caliber of international standards while maintaining  unique  identity  of  particular  contextual  uniqueness  of  curriculum  in  our  country. 
8.  CONCLUSIONS 
The  LIS  departments  could  do  better  by  offering  as  many  courses  possible  that  deal  with  current  issues.  These  should  be  designed  and  taught  in  such  a  manner  so that they could prepare the graduate and post graduate  professionals  to  easily  respond,  adapt  to  changes  in  the  work  place.  Taking  into  consideration  the  potential  benefits  of  ICT,  this  study  set  out  to  evaluate  and  offer  recommendations  in  ICT  competency  framework  that  could help the faculty, staff, practitioners and students in  LIS  to take full advantage. Accordingly, the paper also  provides scope and opportunity for furthering evaluation  and  research  in  area  of  curricula  of  Master’s  degree  and  opportunity  to  forge  newer  structural  constructs  of  library  syllabi  and  LIS  course  contents.
