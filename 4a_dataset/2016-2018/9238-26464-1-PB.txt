The Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati made voluminous efforts to provide better e-resources  services  to  its  users.  This  study  is  an  attempt  to  examine  and  measure  the  extent  and  use  of  e-resources,  information  alert  services,  awareness  towards  the  e-resources,  purpose  of  using  the  e-resources,  attitude  of  library  staff  and  overall  quality  of  e-services  offered  by  the  library  of  Indian  Institute of Technology-Guwahati. 394 survey based questionnaires were distributed and received from  PG students, research scholars and faculty members of IIT-Guwahati which were analysed in this study.  The fndings show that e-journals are more popular than print journals; the library regularly invites users  views  regarding  the  information  constraint;  and  the  library  continuously  puts  forward  information  alert  services to their users. Most of the users are aware about the e-journals/database offered by the library  concerned to their subject and also are able to explore the e-resources allied to their area of interest.

1.  INTrODUcTION 
These days the service qualities of an institution  are  measured  in  terms  of  digital  collections,  e-resources,  networking  element,  ICT  tools,  etc.  Electronic information is the most recent development  in  information  technology  and  is  among  the  most  powerful implement ever invented in human history1.  The  library  users’  satisfaction  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  enlargement  and  provisions  of  the  library  services.  The  potential  users’  feedback  regarding  the library resources, services and facilities should  be  considered  for  providing  necessary  resources  and amenities in the library. In particular, academic  institutions need to measure the users’ satisfaction  to maintain the quality in all the activities2. The IIT- Guwahati witnessed remarkable change in collections,  services and access to resources since the mid-1990s.  Computers  and  computer  applications  have  been  widely  initiated,  and  an  integrated  library  system  has  been  installed.  The  Library  provides  remote  access  to  e-resources.  In  fact,  the  dawn  of  a  new  era in library services and access to resources has  risen in IIT-Guwahati in harmony with the worldwide  information  revolution  in  academia3. 
In  the  IIT-Guwahati  library  has  made  efforts  to  optimise  the  use  of  library  resources  including  
web-based  e-resources.  IIT-Guwahati  has  been  acquiring a large number of web-based e-resources  for its users. The Library now have access to over  12000  full-text  e-journals,  e-books,  and  databases  which can be accessed by the users through library  homepage  both  on  and  off-the-campus4.  
2.  LITErATUrE rEVIEW 
A number of relevant studies have been carried  out  on  the  user  satisfaction  of  the  e-resources. Thanuskodi5  executed a study on education faculty  members  in  Chennai  to  determine  the  extent  to  what  number  of  users  are  aware  and  make  use  of  e-resources  and  also  examine  the  search  pattern  of e-journals. Mounissamy & Swaroop Rani6  in their  study signify that 67 % of the researchers and 33 %  of faculty members regularly access and utilise the  e-journals for multiple purposes.The study furnishes  some  methods  to  make  aware  of  users  towards  the  e-resources.  Sharma7   in  his  study  describe  that  majority  of  the  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  are  capable  to  access  the  e-resources  without  difficulty.  The  survey  was  further  reported  that about half of total faculty members have taken  training  for  the  use  of  electronic  resources.  Garg  &  Tamrakar8   executed  a  study  at  Indian  Institute

of  Technology-Roorkee  to  view  the  efficiency  of  e-resources  offered  by  INDEST-AICTE  consortium.  They found that majority of users preferred e-journals  to  fulfill  their  information  needs.  Bhat  &  Mudhol9 examined  the  awareness  and  use  of  e-resources  by  students  available  in  the  Medical  Institute’s  Library.  The  result  shows  that  most  of  the  users  were  aware  about  e-resources  and  they  use  them  frequently, but less number of terminals, slow speed  of  internet  and  less  number  of  e-resources  were  the  elementary  barriers  of  library  services.  Various  suggestions  were  made  to  improve  the  service  quality  of  the  library.    
Tunji,  Abdulmumin  &  Adisa10   in  their  study  revealed  that  the  frequency  of  use  of  e-resources  by  faculty  members  was  low.  They  pointed-out  various problems such as; lack of awareness among  users about e-resources offered by the library, slow  internet  speed,  frequent  power  cut  and  inadequate  searching skills, were the major problems in proper  utilisation  of  library  services.  
Simmonds  & Andleer11   in  their  research  found  that the academic library usage is mostly influenced  by  a  users’  awareness  and  the  various  resources  of  the  library.  They  suggested  that  library  services  might be improved by considering both factors, user’s  awareness  and  various  e-resources.  The  research  executed  by  Fidzani12   reflects  that  assistance  to  the  patrons  by  the  library  staff  is  very  significant  in  the  utmost  utilisation  of  services  and  a  variety  of  library  information  resources  of  the  library.  
Sasireka13, et  al. ,  in  their  research  found  that  e-journals  are  given  high  priority  by  the  users,  online  journals  are  given  first  choice  by  deemed  universities, IEL online is the most preferred e-journals  followed by ASME and ASCE. Most of the institutions  are  subscribing  e-resources  through  consortium  approach.  Ali14   studied  about  use  of  electronic  information devices among the library users of IIT- Delhi. The study has been examined the awareness  of e-resources, use of e-journals, advanced search  facilities,  users  involvement    with  e-resources,  the  purpose of using e-information, difficulties faced by  the  users  while  accessing  e-information,  available  infrastructure  in  the  library  and  satisfaction  level  of  the  users. 
Jotwani15   describe  the  role  of  IITs  in  higher  education and research. The study shows about big  range  of  e-resources  and  services  offered  by  the  IITs  libraries  to  their  users.  Nisha  &  Ali16   in  their  research paper focused about use of e-journals by  IIT-Delhi and Delhi university library users and result  shows that e-resources offered by the libraries are  much beneficial for the library users. Study illustrate  various  critical  issues  such  as  slow  downloading  speed,  non-availability  of  specific  issue  of  journal,  lack  of  training,  regarding  e-services,  etc. There  is  
41 
no  study  conducted  so  far  in  the  IIT-Guwahati  to  measure the use e-resources and to assess factors  that  may  influence  further  usage  of  e-  resources  and  services.  Moreover,  the  cited  literature  make  known  that  the  studies  of  use,  user  perception  and  user  satisfaction  with  e-resources  have  been  accomplished  in  the  other  analogous  institutions.  Therefore,  a  survey  was  deemed  necessary  to  investigate  the  use  of  e-resources  and  services  in  the IIT-Guwahati library and to uncover the barriers  that  influence  efficiency.  
3.  ObJEcTIVES  
The  basic  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: (a) Study  about  preferred  information  sources  by  
library  users  frequently. 
(b) Ascertain whether  library consider users’ views  
while  selection  of  e-journals  for  library. (c) Know about  user’s awareness towards availability  
of  e-resources. 
(d) Find  out  the  foremost  purpose  of  using  the  
e-resources. 
(e) Examine  the  attitude  of  library  staff  towards  
users. 
(f) Determine  the  overall  quality  of  the  e-services  
offered  by  the  library. 
4.  METHODOLOGY  
To fulfill the stated objectives questionnaires for  collecting the data from the PG students, research  scholars  and  faculty  members  of  the  following  10  departments  of  IIT-Guwahati:  (1)  Department  of  Biochemical  Engineering  and  Biotechnology;  (2)  Department  of  Chemical  Engineering;  (3)  Department  of  Chemistry;  (4)  Department  of  Civil  Engineering; (5) Department of Electrical Engineering;  (6) Department of Computer Science and Engineering;  (7) Department of Humanities and Social Sciences;  (8)  Department  of  Mathematics;  (9)  Department  of  Mechanical  Engineering;  and  (10)  Department  of  Physics. 
The  questionnaires  were  randomly  distributed  to  the  users  who  were  present  at  their  concerned  departments  and  library.  Data  were  collected  from  the aforesaid users, as well as personal interviews  were  also  made  with  respondents  and  library  in- charge  to  clarify  the  ambiguities  (Appendix-1).  For  the purpose of this study overall 773 questionnaires  were randomly distributed among the users, and 394  questionnaires  were  received  back.  196  (51.57%)  respondents were PG students, 116 (48.73 %) were  research  scholars  and  82  (52.90  %)  were  faculty  members.  Another  questionnaire  was  sent  to  the  librarian  to  get  the  additional  required  information  on  the  topic.  The  data  collected  was  scrutinised,

print journals and to seek the back volumes of  
periodicals. 
(b) 7.86 % users utilise other computerised databases,  
such as, educational CDs, DVDs, off-line journals,  
etc.  
(c) E-journals  are  given  high  preferences  by  all  
the  three  categories  of  the  users.  
(d) Print journals are still as popular as e-journals.

library  may  consider  other  ways  in  which  to  
obtained  feedback  from  its  user  on  electronic  
resources and on potential new e-resources as  
well  as  opinion  on  existing  e-resources.  (c) The library should also inform users about new  
e-resources  and  services  as  well  as  existing  
resources.  
(d) Library  should  inquire  potential  information  
need  of  the  users.  Subsequent  to  consultation  
with  faculty,  liaisons,  appropriate  library,  staff  
and  students,  coordinator  of  e-resources  will  
solicit  feedback  and  evaluate  the  product  and  
its  necessities  based  on  the  trial. 
6.3  Alert  Services  
(a) 59.39 % respondents get regular information alert  
services from the library. 18.27 % respondents  
are  not  getting  proper  alert  services  from  the  
library  side.  
(b) The library may offer users the facility to create  
research alert profiles so that automated keyword  
search and tables of contents alerts for journals  
could  be  sent  regularly  to  an  e-mail  address  
generated by the user. For security point of view  
some special alert services might be limited to  
IIT-Guwahati  faculty,  student  and  staff.  

========4========

TAMRAKAR & GARG: uSER PERCEPTION TOWARDS E-RESOuRCES AND SERVICES OF IIT-GuWAHATI LIBRARy 
(c) To  access  alert  services  off  campus,  user  may  
need  to  go  through  the  library  proxy  server  
using  the  bookmark  or  by  proxying  uRLs.  (d) The library may also send out alerts via RSS or  
web-feeds, for that users should have a simple   
software  identify  as  feed  reader,  collectively  
the  web  feeds  of  their  choice,  permit  them  to  
browse  fresh  contents  via,  the  reader,  rather  
than  having  to  visit  different  websites  or  go

E-resources 
(a) 59.89 % respondents were aware about available  
e-journals/database  in  library  in  their  subject  
areas. A large group of respondents (40.10 %)  
were not aware about. To enhance awareness,  
programmes  should  be  organised,  so  that  the  
users  know  about  the  facilities  and  benefits  
obtainable  from  e-format.  
(b) More  Information  literacy  and  user  education  
programmes could be organised by the library with  
prominence  on  information  exploring  skills. (c) The  consortium  with  the  publishers  should  
impart  workshops  and  training  programmes  for  
patrons  to  makes  better  use  of  e-resources.  (d) IIT-Guwahati library may provide access to the  
recent  table  of  contents  of  scholarly  journals. 
6.5  Purpose  of  Using  the  E-resources 
(a) Most of the respondents explore the e-resources  
to  get  full  text  e-journals,  followed  by  using  
e-resources to obtain abstract or specific-articles  
and  to  acquire  back  files  of  e-journals,  small  
group of respondents make use of the e-resources  
to  find  bibliographic  databases. 
(b) Most of the users of IIT-Guwahati are aware of  
e-journals  and  are  using  them  for  information,  
updating  their  knowledge,  and  for  collecting  
significant material for their study and research  
purposes.  
6.6 courteousness  of  Library  Staff/Volunteers (a) Most  of  the  library  staff/volunteers  of  IIT- 
Guwahati  are  found  courteous;  they  were  very  
library  are  ‘very  helpful’  followed  by  ‘extreme

are  not  satisfied. 
(b) E-services offered by the library of IIT-Guwahati  
have positive influence on the users’ academic  
efficiency  through  increased  access  to  current  
information,  ease  research  process  as  well  as  
improve  their  professional  competence. (c) 75  %  users  of  IIT-Guwahati  agreed  that  the  
library offered an adequate range of e-resources  
and services, but also suggested to incorporate  
more e-resources and extensive services in future  
to  enhance  the  utilisation  of  library  services. 
7. cONcLUSIONS 
The  library  should  have  to  institutionalise  its  performance  assessment  by  customers  approach.  This might be done periodically to have a response  from  the  users  on  how  excellently  the  library  is  meeting their information necessities. The study has  clearly  indicated  that  the  e-resources  seem  to  be  highly  constructive  for  the  research  and  academic  community of IIT-Guwahati. Most users of the library  preferred journals in both print as well as electronic  format. Therefore,  both  versions  should  harmonise  each  other  to  meet  the  information  desires  of  the  users.  Training  of  users  is  acknowledged  as  continuing  challenge  that  requires  new  and  more  inventive approaches. It was found that most of the  users are aware of e-journals and they are not only  using  them  to  update  their  knowledge  but  also  to  accumulate  relevant  material  for  their  studies  and  research.  The  study  also  reveals  that  library  staff  is  courteous  and  co-operative.The  overall  qualities  of  e-services  offered  by  IIT-Guwahati  library  are  found  effective. 
supportive  and  assist  the  users  in  locating  
specific  resources. 
(b) Services  being  offered  by  the  IIT-Guwahati  
library staff seems effective but more perfection
