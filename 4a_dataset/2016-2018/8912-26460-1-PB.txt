   AbstrACt 
The central library of National Law University Delhi has rich collection of law e-books from various  publishers. These e-books were available to the faculty and students through different publisher platforms  and it was diffcult to fnd them subject-wise. Library is currently using LIBSYS-7 automation software.  The paper depicts detailed experiment carried out to weave these e-books into library catalogue through  LIBSYS-7. The whole technical process is described step by step and searching e-books through OPAC.  The e-books can be searched subject-wise along-with print books and their full text can be downloaded  through OPAC. This experiment establishes library catalogue as core source of information of all library  resources. Users get beneftted to a great extent in fnding their desired e-book through library catalogue.  Other  libraries  having  rich  e-book  collection  may  adopt  this  practice  for  the  beneft  of  their  end-users.

1.  INtroDUCtIoN 
The collection development strategy of libraries  has changed due to limited physical space in libraries  and  more  techno-friendly  users.  Now  the  libraries  have  been  transformed  into  digital  libraries.  The  format of resources available in libraries is changed  from  print  to  digital  resources.  Academic  libraries  are  facing  more  challenges  as  the  new  generation  users  are  more  oriented  towards  technology  and  henceforth  more  demanding  to  read  in  electronic  formats through smart phones, laptops, tablets, etc.  E-books  have  been  emerged  as  a  major  form  of  collection  which  these  users  are  anticipating  from  libraries.  E-book  is  electronic  copy  of  a  printed  book  or  a  computer  file  that  needs  a  device  such  as  personal  computer  or  personal  digital  assistant  (PDAs)  to  access  and  read  . Acquisition,  licensing  contracts, management and access of these e-books  is  the  major  challenge  for  library  managers.  
1.1  E-books 
The  phrase  ‘electronic  book’  is  coined  by  Van  Dam during 1960s while working on the concept of  hypertext  systems.  In  1971,  Michael  Hart  started  project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org), which  covered works available in public domain including  literature,  religious  books  and  reference  books.  Project Gutenberg is the largest project on e-books  providing  access  of  almost  46000  free  e-books  throughout the world. In 1981, the first commercial  e-book  was  launched  by  Random  House  .  
E-book is defined by Oxford English Dictionary1 as  ‘an  electronic  version  of  a  printed  book  which  can  be  read  on  a  computer  or  special  hand-held  device.’  Armstrong,  Edwards  &  Lonsdale2   defined  e-books  as  ‘any  piece  of  electronic  text  regardless  of size or composition (a digital object) but excluding  journal publications, made available electronically (or  optically)  for  any  device  (handheld  or  desk-bound)  that  includes  a  screen.’ 
E-books need specific physical device for reading.  The  definition  given  in  Oxford  English  Dictionary  indicates  towards  both  the  e-book  and  e-book  reader. In 1990s there were PDAs that were popular  for  reading  e-books.  After  that  many  commercial  players came with e-book readers. However the most  successful one are Amazon-Kindle, Sony’s-PRS-500,  Barnes and Noble-Nook. Apple’s i-Pad is also popular  as  e-book  reader  along  with  its  other  features.  Now  most  of  the  smart  phones  are  having  feature  to  read  e-books  through  various  applications  and  these  have  become  most  popular.  In  academic  environment,  e-books  are  considered  as  standard  resources  in  libraries  where  researchers,  faculty  and  students  are  expecting  it  from  their  libraries  to  support  teaching  and  learning. 
There is a variety of content type that is being  published  in  e-book  format  like  reference  books  (dictionaries,  encyclopaedias,etc.,)  text  books,  literature, old classic books (which are out of print),  multimedia  books  (embedded  sound  and  images).  Oxford University Press has a very comprehensive

collection  of  e-books  packaged  in  several  bundles  like  Oxford  Reference  Online,  Oxford  Scholarship  Online (in subject areas like Law, economics, finance,  political science, philosophy, etc.). Similarly, Cambridge  University Press has also collection names like text  books  (in  various  disciplines),  reference  books,  etc. Taylor and Francis, Springer, Wiley, Hart, etc.,  are  other  leading  e-book  publishers.  Selection  and  acquisition  of  e-books  in  libraries  is  also  a  major  task  on  the  part  of  library  managers.  E-books  are  available to the libraries directly through publishers or  aggregators. E-book aggregators are the companies  that  are  not  involved  in  the  work  of  publishing,  but  they  collocate  e-books  from  various  publishers  and  make  it  available  to  libraries  through  specific  hardware  and  software  platforms.  Some  leading  aggregators in e-book market are Ebrary, netLibrary,  Safari,  Books@Ovid,  etc.  
There  are  many  benefits  to  use  e-books  over  printed  books.  E-books  allow  readers  to  create  bookmarks, adjust font and size and make annotations  for  notes.  Like  other  resources  in  e-format  the  e-books  are  available  24/7,  multi-user,  search  and  navigation  facilities,  hyper  linking,  etc.  Previously  e-books were available only in Adobe pdf and open  e-book (OEB) formats. Now some other formats are  also  coming  like  EPUB  and  Mobipocket.  Presently,  PDF,  HTML  and  XML  are  the  most  popular  and  established  formats  of  e-books.  
1.2  National  Law  University  Delhi  Library

There  are  various  approaches  through  which  academic libraries are making available the e-books  to their users. Some libraries have created consortia  of  e-books  along  with  other  electronic  products.  Shepherd  &  Langston3     reported  that  California  State  University  System  acquire  e-books  through  consortial  patron  driven  acquisition  system. 
The  Northwest  Academic  Libraries  in  UK  has  created  consortia  of  13  libraries  covering  12000  priced e-book titles with 3800 free titles. Jianzhong4 reported development of hybrid library in Shanghai  via  netLibrary  covering  30,000  e-books  in  Chinese  and  5000  e-books  in  English.  Korean  Education  Research  and  Information  Service  has  created  a  consortium through netLibrary of seventy university  libraries  to  share  access  to  8000  e-book  titles.  On  the  other  hand,  McLure  &  Hoseth5   opined  that  Colorado  State  University  Libraries  provide  access  to about 1,62,000 e-books through different vendor  platforms.  The  library  has  adopted  Patron  Driven  Acquisition  Model  for  purchase  of  e-books.

and  access  management.  It  is  concluded  that  the  libraries  must  be  cautious  about  digital  rights  management  restrictions,  platform  dependency,  access management software etc. Walters7   explored  the  issues  in  selection  and  acquisition  of  e-books.  Further,  it  examines  the  licensing  agreements,  terms  of  use  and  management  as  well  as  access  of  e-books  in  academic  libraries.  Gauld8   advised  that  a  publisher/aggregator  should  be  chosen  on  the  basis  of  content  relevancy,  functionality  and  user-friendliness,  ownership  of  content,  licensing  conditions,  technical  infrastructure  and  provision  of statistics. Behler9   suggested  that  while  planning  for  collection  development  for  e-books  the  library  must  consider  some  important  points  like  budget,  duplication  of  already  available  printed  titles,  content  model,  purchase  model,  licensing,  access  model,  technologies  users  have  like  PC,  PDA  or  smart  phones,  etc.  Muller10     explored  the  laws  of  Germany,  USA  and  Canada  regarding  interlibrary  lending  of  e-books.  It  is  found  that  there  is  no  legal regulation for inter-lending of e-books, as the  licensing  authorisation  are  from  publisher,  author  or  right  holders  only.  Castell11   discussed  various  licensing  and  pricing  models  offered  by  publishers  and  vendors  to  public  libraries  in  Canada.  E-book  subscription  platforms  are  also  discussed.    
Management  of  e-books  in  libraries  is  a  major  challenge  on  the  part  of  librarians.  There  are  no  clear-cut guidelines in catalogue codes for organising  e-books. Another major hindrance on the issue is if  there are certain theories of organisation, technology  also  have  some  limitations.  The  most  important  challenges  libraries  face  in  cataloguing  e-books  is  either  to  create  separate  records  for  e-books  and  their print counterparts, or to have single record of  both  to  facilitate  subject-wise  search  in  the  main  catalogue.  Belanger12   informed  that  UK  higher  education  libraries  have  no  uniform  practice  in  the  use  of  single  or  separate  records  for  e-books. The  practice  is  explored  in  28  libraries.  Among  them,  23 libraries have separate records for e-books and  their  print  counterparts.  Only  five  libraries  have  maintained  integrated  records  for  e-books  through  their OPACs. Gravett13  stated that in 2005 University  of Surrey library started importing catalogue records  into TALIS library management system. In academic  libraries  e-books  can  be  integrated  to  the  library  management  software  to  ensure  more  visibility  to  the  collection.  It  all  depends  on  local  policies  of  the  libraries  depending  on  their  unique  situations  and  user  expectations.

The JTPSC Library has automated its in-house  system through LIBSYS library management software.  
7 
The latest version LIBSYS-714   is  available  for  use.  It  is  powerful  and  user  friendly  software  with  the  facility  of  Web-OPAC.  LIBSYS-7  has  five  basic  modules-acquisition, cataloguing, circulation, serials  and  OPAC.  The  cataloguing  system  in  LIBSYS-7  provides  online  catalogue  for  faster  access  of  the  library  materials. The  system  has  facility  to  accept  data  in  standard  machine  readable  formats  such  as  CCF,  MARC,  etc.  This  makes  possible  import/ export  of  bibliographic  data  in  standard  exchange  formats . LIBSYS-7 has a special feature to integrate  multimedia  files.  These  files  may  be  browsed  in  a  multi-window  interface  with  standard  windows  features. This feature provides the facility of looking  at  a  video  clip,  an  image  or  to  listen  to  an  audio  file  related  to  a  particular  title.  LIBSYS-7  supports  about  20  types  of  files  such  as,  Bitmap  (BMP),  TIFF (.TIF), Wave (.WAV), MIDI (.MID), Audio-visual  interface (.AVI), Word (.DOC), Excel (.XLS), (.PDF),  (.JPEG),  (.GIF),  etc.  
As there is lack of significant literature on steps  of  importing  mark  records  of  e-books  into  library  management  software  particularly  LIBSYS,  the  process has been done only on the basis of practical  experiments  of  library  managers  of  the  University.  The library has integrated its e-books catalogue into  LIBSYS-7 software to enable full-text access of e-books  directly through library OPAC. Following  steps were  taken to integrate e-books into LIBSYS-7 software.   Step  1:  Created  excel  file  of  bibliographic  details    
             of e-books including fields of Acc no., Title,  
                  Author,  Call  No,  ISBN,  Edition,  Publisher,  
              etc.,  and  most  importantly  URL  of  that   
                  particular  e-book.  
Step  2:  URL  cannot  be  imported  directly  into  
          LIBSYS-7,  therefore  removed  the  URLs  
          from  excel  file.  Converted  the  Excel  file  
            into  .csv  format  (comma  separated).  Step  3:  In  circulation  module  defined  series  as  
          e-books  and  limit  as  99999.  
Step  4:  In  cataloguing  module  defined  type  of  
        document  as  e-books  and  its  description.  Step  5:  Pasted  the  .csv  file  into  LIBSYS  server  
          in  PFIL  folder.  
Step 6:  In cataloguing module added the fields as  
          defined  in  step  1  and  process.  
Step  7:  As  URL  cannot  be  imported  directly,  
            therefore added URL of every book separately  
          as  shown.  Go  to  the  multimedia  feature  
          through  cataloguing  module. 
        Cataloguing—Maintenance—Multimedia 
Put  the  Accession  Number,  Add  URL  of  that  particular e-book and process. The URL will be added.  (Note:  URL  of  each  book  is  to  be  added  separately).  Step  8:    For  earching  e-books,  the  end  user  will  
      go to OPAC

Studies in other libraries have found that cataloguing   of e-books help to discover them and increased their  use. Use of e-books was increased by approximately  50 % at the University of Texas. Green15  stated that  adding  e-book  records  and  URLs  to  the  catalogue

made  identifying  e-book  titles  easier  for  students.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  use  of  e-books  in  NLU,  Delhi  will  increase  after  this  practice. 
4.    CoNCLUsI oNs 
Now many libraries have large e-book collections  but  their  cataloguing  practice  is  still  in  its  nascent  phase. The provision of organising e-books in AACR  is  also  not  sufficient  enough.  However,  variety  of  library management softwares with varying features is  also a hindrance in cataloguing of e-books uniformly.  There is lack of literature on the practical steps. But  as readers of e-books have increased, librarians are  bound to find out ways for effective management and  access  of  e-books.  The  Joint  Information  Systems  Committee on promoting e-books for higher education  recommended that library OPACs must be searchable  by  format  of  reading  material  to  facilitate  users  to  search e-books16. Present effort is done to integrate  e-books  with  print  book  catalogue  through  library  automation  software  to  collocate  search  results,  as  well  as  ease  in  finding  the  e-books  subject- wise.  Only  e-books  can  be  also  searched  in  the  automation  software.
