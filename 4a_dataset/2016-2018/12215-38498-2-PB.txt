ABSTRACT 
The purpose of this study is to measure the service quality of the libraries of Indian Council of Agricultural  Research institutes in Kerala. Survey method with modifed SERVQUAL questionnaire was employed to elicit  responses from a representative sample of 180 users of the libraries. It is revealed that the ICAR institute libraries  lack service quality. While the libraries compared, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute Library has shown  quality to an extent and library of Central Tuber Crops Research Institute has shown least service quality. Library  collection dimension was found as the most expected dimension whereas library staf dimension was the most  perceived dimension. The highest service quality gap was identifed with library service dimension and the lowest  gap was identifed with library staf dimension. Regular user need assessment and feedback mechanism should be  done to improve the service quality of the libraries. The study can be utilised for developing quality enhancement  
practices in special libraries in India.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Like  every  other  service  organisations,  libraries  also  require  quality  in  their  services.  The  word  ‘quality’  arises  from  the  recent  trends  in  industry  and  commerce;  currently  it  is  closely  associated  with  existing  research  in  libraries1.  Service quality in library is defned as providing accurate and  reliable information as needed by users without any delay.  Its  assurance can be met by maintaining quality in every area of  library activity such as acquisition, classifcation, cataloguing,  issue, return, renewal, etc.  According to Brady and Cronin2 “service quality is a multidimensional construct with multiple  attributes”.  Sahu3 defned  service  quality  as  “the  diference  between  users’  expectations  and  perceptions  of  service  performance and the reality of the service”. The author further  pointed out that prompt delivery and error free services were  the major criteria for identifying library quality. A regular and  systematic  monitoring  will  make  the  library  services  more  reliable.  
Service  quality  of  libraries  is  measured  by  assessing  whether the information and service provided by the libraries  satisfes  the  user’s  needs  and  expectations.  According  to  Arshad and Ameen4, technological advancement and social and  economic changes have great impact on the role of libraries.  Kumar5  observed that libraries are facing severe competitions  from  commercial  information  service  providers.  In  order  to  provide quality services, libraries must be able to identify the

ever-changing needs of their users. Frequent user studies with  feedback  mechanism  helps  to  address  the  grievances  of  the  users and thereby ensuring healthy relationship with users.  
The  ICAR  was  established  on  10th   July  1929.  It  is  an  institution  under  the  Department  of  Agricultural  Research  and Education, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare,  Government of India. There are 101 research institute and 71  agricultural university under ICAR. It is one of the foremost  national agricultural systems in the world. The main objectives  of  the  institute  are  to  coordinate,  guide  and  manage  the  education and research in Agriculture including Horticulture,  Fisheries and Animal Science in India6. A proper and efcient  library  system  is  essential  for  satisfying  the  objectives  of  the  institutes.  For  quick  and  easy  access  to  information  related to recent trends in agriculture, libraries are providing  enormous  services  such  as  institutional  repository  service  (Krishikosh, Krishiprabha), union catalogue service (Agricat),  newspaper clipping service, open access journals and e-books,  databases, etc. The Consortium for e-Resources in Agriculture  (CeRA)  provides  access  to  scientifc  journals  in  the  feld  of  agriculture.   
Hassanzadeh7, et al. stressed the mission of special libraries  as  meeting  the  information  needs  of  parent  organisations.  But  many  of  the  ICAR  institute  libraries  do  not  have  adequate collections and services to support the research and  development activities. Therefore there should be a systematic  assessment  of  the  collections  and  services  of  libraries.  This  study  measures  the  service  quality  of  the  libraries  of  ICAR  institutes in Kerala.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW  
Quality  assessment  of  libraries  helps  to  evaluate  and  improve  the  performance  of  libraries. There  were  enormous  researches pertaining to the service quality of libraries by using  SERVQUAL. An attempt has been carried out to explore the  signifcance  of  service  quality  in  libraries.  While  assessing  the service quality of Punjab University libraries, Arshad and  Ameen4  found that the expectations of users are higher than  their  perceptions  and  also  observed  ‘tangible’  dimension  as  the most important dimension. Kumar1 studied service quality  management  in  agricultural  university  libraries  by  assessing  the  views  of  librarians  regarding  leadership,  strategy  and  policy, staf management, process management and resource  management. Wang and Shieh8  observed that service quality  has positive efect on user satisfaction. besides these, the study  found that, collections, loaning and returning service, overall  atmosphere, electronic database system and online reservation  and  renewal  are  the  most  important  service  attributes.  The  assessment  of  service  quality  in  Kerala  State  Council  for  Science  and  Technology  (KSCSTE)  libraries  by  Sajna  and  Haneefa9   showed  that  KSCSTE  libraries  have  low  service  quality. Mohindra and Kumar10  measured the impact of library  service  quality  on  user  satisfaction  at  A.C.  Joshi  Library,  Punjab  University  and  found  that  library  environment  and  library services have positive efect on library service quality.  Haneefa11, et al. evaluated the service quality of Infonet digital  library consortium of Calicut University library and observed  that, as the user perceptions are lower than their expectations,  the  quality  expectations  were  not  satisfed.  Through  the  service quality evaluation of academic libraries in developing  countries, Asogwa12   observed  that  lack  of  modern  facilities,  poor  funding,  and  weak  e-leadership  quality  have  negative  efect  on  quality  of  library  services.  Haneefa  and  Aswani13 investigated  the  quality  of  e-services  of  university  libraries  in  Kerala  and  found  that  they  perceived  low  service  quality  and also observed that the e-services were not up to the users  expectations.  
While  compiling  the  literature,  it  was  noted  that  most  of  the  literature  confnes  to  service  quality  measurement  of  university  libraries,  college  libraries  and  public  libraries,  however, there were no reports regarding the service quality  of  libraries  under  ICAR  institutes.  In  this  light,  this  study  measures service quality of ICAR institute libraries. 
3. METHODOLOGY 
There  are  fve iCAR  research  institutes  in  Kerala  viz.,  Central Marine Fisheries Institute (CMFRI), Central Institute  of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), Central Tuber Crops Research  Institute (CTCRI), Central Plantation Crops Research Institute  (CPCRI) and Indian Institute of Spices Research (IISR). The  study was conducted on four of these institutes exempting IISR  which did not permit the required data collection.  
The  study  employed  survey  method  with  SERVQUAL  questionnaire. The SERVQUAL questionnaire is an instrument  developed  by  Parasuraman16,  et  al.   for  measuring  service  quality  on  the  basis  of  gap  analysis.  According  to  them  service quality can be measured under 10 dimensions, which  are:  tangibles,  reliability,  responsiveness,  communication,  
credibility,  security,  competence,  courtesy,  understanding/ knowing the customer and access. With further modifcations,  later  it  was  reduced  to  fve.  They  are;  reliability,  tangibles,  responsiveness,  assurance  and  empathy.  Of  these,  reliability  measures the accuracy and reliability of the promised services  delivered; tangibles measures the quality of those things which  are tangible in nature; responsiveness measures the ability and  willingness  of  the  service  provider  to  provide  the  required  service as and when needed; assurance measures the knowledge  and courtesy of the service provider and empathy measures the  caring and individual attention given by the service provider.  The  questionnaire  contains  22  statements.  The  formula  for  measuring service quality is,   
Q = P - E  
where  Q   is  service  quality,  P  is  perception,  and   E  is  expectation. 
However,  this  study  modifed  the  SERVQUAL  questionnaire with 50 statements under fve dimensions viz.,  physical  facility,  library  collection,  library  staf,  technical  process and library service. Each statement was designed to  elicit responses on a fve point Likert Scale to measure both  expectations and perceptions of the users on the service quality  of the libraries. All the statements were fnalised on the basis  of  reliability  and  validity  test.  Out  of  180  questionnaires  distributed,  129  questionnaires  were  returned  back  with  a  response rate of 71.6 per cent, which includes 41 from CMFRI,  44 from CIFT, 27 from CTCRI and 17 from CPCRI. Besides  these,  librarians  were  also  interviewed  for  supplementing  additional information.  
There  have  been  numerous  researches  conducted  in  library  and  information  services  with  modifed  SERVQUAL  instrument.  Andaleeb  and  Simmonds17   measured  service  quality of academic libraries by adding an additional dimension  ‘resources’ and combined both the ‘assurance’ and ‘empathy’  dimension into ‘demeanor’ whereas Majeed15 changed the fve  dimensions as physical facility, library collection, library staf,  technical  process  and  library  service  for  measuring  service  quality  of  college  libraries.  Service  quality  measurement  of  library of dhaka University was done by Ahmed and Shoeb14 on the basis of four dimensions which are: afect of service  (organisational), collection and access, library as a place, and  afect of service (personal).   
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Service quality can vary on the basis of expectations and  perceptions  of  users.  Data  analysis  includes  the  analysis  of  users  expectations,  perceptions,  gap  and  the  overall  service  quality of the four ICAR institute libraries. Statistical measures  like  mean  and  standard  deviation  were  used  to  assess  the  diferences.  The  analysis  throws  light  on  the  most  expected  and  perceived  dimensions,  least  expected  and  perceived  dimensions  and  dimensions  having  lowest  and  highest  gap  along with identifying which library provided quality service. 
4.1  Expectations  of  the  Library  Users 
Library users always have high expectations. In order to  maintain such quality level, libraries have to provide services  as  expected  by  their  users.  Therefore,  every  library  strives  
157 

========2========

to identify the changing needs and expectations of the users.  For  this  purpose,  libraries  conduct  user  studies,  feedback  mechanism,  regular  interactions  with  librarians,  etc.  The  Table 1 explains expectations of the users of the ICAR institute  libraries. 
The service quality of a library depends to a large extend  on  the  quality  of  fve  dimensions,  such  as;  physical  facility,  library  collection,  library  staf,  technical  process  and  library  service. The physical facility dimension measures the quality  of  physical  facilities  provided  by  the  libraries  of  the  ICAR  institutes.  It  includes  convenience  of  the  location,  adequate  reading  space,  comfortable  furniture,  cleanliness,  drinking  water facility, lavatory facility, etc. Table 1 shows that under this  dimension, CMFRI library has the highest expectation (Mean  4.717,  SD  0.313)  followed  by  CPCRI  library  (Mean  4.647,  SD 0.277) whereas the CIFT library has the least expectation  (Mean  4.590,  SD  0.449)  followed  by  CTCRI  library  (Mean  4.611, SD 0.366). The study observed that the users of the library  strongly demanded a clean, tidy and hygienic environment in  the library with adequate lighting and ventilation. They were  not much concerned about the location of the library. 
The library collection dimension measures the quality of  the library resources with the elements such as, whether library  resources  meets  the  requirements  of  users,  access  to  wide  variety  and  range  of  books,  journals,    e-resources,  technical  reports,  patent  and  reports,  back  volumes  of  journals,  audio  visual  materials,  etc.  It  can  be  seen  that  (Table1),  the  users  of  CMFRI  library  have  high  expectation  (Mean  4.711,  SD  0.385) on this dimension, which is followed by CIFT library  (Mean 4.688, SD 0.391). However, the users of CPCRI library  have  low  expectation  (Mean  4.597,  SD  0.460). With  regard  to library collection, users primarily needed access to all the  collections of books and journals rather than access to audio  visual materials. 
The staf of every library has great impact on its service  quality.  Library  users  always  expect  to  have  knowledgeable  and expert staf willing to help them as and when needed. The  library staf dimension measure attributes such as their skills,  competency, emotional intelligence, etc. It was found that the  users of CTCRI library have high expectation (Mean 4.656,  SD  0.425)  on  this  dimension  followed  by  CMFRI  library  (Mean  4.619,  SD  0.494)  whilst,  the  users  of  CPCRI  library  have comparatively low expectation (Mean 4.512, SD 0.458).  The users expect quick response from the staf, but they were  
not interested in getting personal attention.  
Technical  process  plays  vital  role  in  carrying  out  the  functions of the library efectively. This dimension measures  the accuracy of cataloguing and classifcation system, efciency  of the ICT infrastructure, reliability of library website, internet  and Wi-Fi facility, etc. As portrayed in Table 1, users of CPCRI  library have high expectation (Mean 4.753, SD 0.306) followed  by CTCRI library (Mean 4.711 SD 0.387). On the other hand,  CIFT  library  users  have  low  expectation  (Mean  4.625,  SD  0.388)  on  this  dimension.  Users  are  highly  concerned  about  better preservation techniques to keep the resources free from  damage and dust and expect library to be updated frequently  with latest technologies. 
Libraries  provide  varied  services  to  its  users  in  order  to meet their changing needs and expectations, even though  the  users  sometimes  don’t  get  what  was  actually  required.  The library service dimension measures the quality of every  services provided by the library. It includes user alert service,  institutional  repository  service,  video  library  service,  Xerox  service, indexing and abstracting service, newspaper clipping  service, user orientation, etc. Table 1 gives a clear understanding  that, the users of CMFRI library have high expectation (Mean  4.685, SD 0.375) on these services whereas the users of CPCRI  library have low expectation (Mean 4.514, SD 0.424). The most  expected items under this dimension were ‘convenient library  timing’ and ‘keep users informed about collections, services  and facilities of the library’. The least expected services were  ‘user based alert service’ and ‘newspaper clipping service’. 
The overall result shows that the users of CMFRI library  have the highest expectation on all dimensions except library  staf and technical process. The most expected dimension was  library collection (Mean 4.681, SD 0.398) and the least expected  dimension was library service (Mean 4.582, SD 0.420).  
4.2 Perceptions  of  the  Library  Users 
The perception of the library users pertains to the actual  service  experienced  from  the  library.  While  in  comparison  with the expectations, users always have low perceptions. The  lower  perception  indicates  low  service  quality.  A  library  is  said to have service quality only if the perceptions of the users  meet or preferably exceed their expectations. Thus the service  quality of the library can only be enhanced by improving the  perceptions of users by providing services as expected by them.  The Table 2 depicts the perceptions the users.

CIFT Mean 3.744 3.968 4.270 3.870 3.518 
It shows that under the physical facility dimension, CMFRI  library  (Mean  4.128,  SD  0.471)  has  the  highest  perception  followed by CPCRI library (Mean 3.978, SD 0.403) and CTCRI  library (Mean 3.681, SD 0.414) has the lowest perception. It  also indicates that CMFRI library has been providing far better  physical  facilities  than  the  other  three  libraries.  The  study  observed that majority of the libraries have clean and hygiene  environment as expected by users with adequate lighting and  ventilation. But most of the libraries are not providing needed  physical facilities to diferently-abled users.  
Table 2 makes it clear that, under the library collection  dimension, users of CMFRI library have the highest perception  (Mean  4.544,  SD  0.472)  followed  by  CPCRI  library  (Mean  4.159, SD 0.525) whereas CTCRI library users (Mean 3.868,  SD 0.629) have the lowest perception. It can be observed that,  the CMFRI library has a good collection as expected by the  users  and  provide  access  to  all  books  and  journals.  Besides  these,  back  volumes  of  journals  are  efciently  maintained  whereas most of the resources do not meet the requirements  of the users. 
The library staf dimension also shows that CMfRi  library  users  have  the  highest  perception  (Mean  4.437,  SD  0.499),  whereas CTCRI library users have the lowest perception (Mean  3.896,  SD  0.660)  in  this  regard.  All  these  libraries,  except  CTCRi  have excellent library staf. The study found that staf  helped the users when they failed to locate a needed document  and they were more approachable and welcoming. but the staf  lacked emotional intelligence to deal with the users.  
The  perception  score  (Mean  4.337,  SD  0.543)  shows  that  the  technical  section  of  CMFRI  library  is  performing  appropriately  on  the  other  hand  the  perception  score  not  good at CTCRI library (Mean 3.215, SD 0.533). The libraries  systematically  carried  out  the  classifcation  and  cataloguing

process  even  though  they  are  not  updated  with  latest  technologies. 
Under the library service dimension, the perception score  of  CMFRI  library  (Mean  3.919,  SD  0.664)  shows  that  the  library is providing most of the expected services to its users  while the perception score of CTCRI library (Mean 2.790, SD  0.469) points out poor service performance. The Xerox service  is  provided  by  every  library  but  the  content  page  service  is  provided by the least. 
The overall result of user’s perception shows that the most  perceived dimension was library staf (Mean 4.249, Sd  0.588)  and the least perceived dimension was ‘library service’ (Mean  3.502, SD 0.675).      
4.3 Service  Quality  of  ICAR  Institute  Libraries 
in  SERVQUAL,  service  quality  is  based  on  the  gap  between  the  expectations  and  perceptions  of  users. Through  gap  analysis,  it  is  possible  to  identify  areas  which  needed  more attention. The negative gap indicates low service quality  and positive gap indicates high service quality, and if there is  no gap, it is assumed that there exists quality. Table 3 shows  dimension wise analysis of service quality. 
The  analysis  shows  that  under  the  physical  facility  dimension, the CMFRI library has the lowest gap (Mean -0.589,  SD 0.536) and CTCRI library has the highest gap (Mean -0.931,  SD 0.421). Therefore, the CTCRI library should provide better  physical facilities to its users.  Under this dimension, libraries  need  to  consider  adequate  physical  facilities  for  diferently  abled users and drinking water facility to users.  
The  CTCRI  library  has  the  highest  gap  value  (Mean  -0.809, SD 0.586) under the library collection dimension and  CMFRI library have the lowest gap (Mean -0.167, SD 0.529).  Most  of  the  libraries  do  not  have  good  collection  of  audio

visual materials; therefore, while updating the collections, the  audio visual materials should have to be improved. 
The library staf dimension shows that the CTCRi  library  has  the  highest  gap  (Mean  -0.759,  SD  0.629)  and  CMFRI  library has the lowest gap (Mean -0.183, SD 0.513). The study  assessed  that  the  libraries  need  to  have  knowledgeable  and  expert staf. 
Under the technical process dimension, the highest and  lowest  gaps  were  found  with  CTCRI  library  (Mean-1.496,  SD  0.618)  and  CMFRI  library  (Mean  -0.321,  SD  0.573)  accordingly. Majority of the libraries lack a well-designed and  well-managed library website. Therefore, there is a need for  regularly updating and maintaining library website.  
The highest gap of CTCRI library (Mean, -1.867 SD 0.548)  indicates that the services provided by the library was unable  to  meet  the  quality  expectations  of  the  users  meanwhile  the  lowest gap of CPCRi  library (Mean-0.766, S d0.799) refected  the good quality of the services. None of the libraries provide  special services to diferently abled users. Most of the users are  unaware about various services provided by the libraries.   
The  overall  result  shows  that  the  ‘library  service’  dimension has the highest gap (Mean -1.080, SD 0.742) and  library staf has the lowest gap (Mean-0.345, Sd  0.571) which  makes it clear that even though these libraries have skilled and  knowledgeable  staf,  the  provided  services  are  not  meeting  their users expectations. The overall quality analysis provided  a clear picture of the service quality of each library under the  ICAR  institutes.  The  expectations,  perceptions  and  gaps  of  libraries were assessed individually.  
Table  4    depicts  the  diferences  between  overall  expectations  and  perceptions  of  users.  Service  quality  is  assessed based on these gap diferences. The negative gap score  refects that the service quality of the libraries never met the  user expectations. From the table it can be seen that the users  of  CMFRI  library  have  high  expectations  (4.678)  and  high  perceptions (4.273). In contrast, CMFRI library has the least  negative gap. The users of CIFT library have low expectations  (4.587) and the users of CTCRI library have low perceptions  (3.489). As  the  perceptions  are  lower  than  the  expectations,  CTCRI  library  has  the  highest  negative  gap  (-1.173).  As  compared to the other three libraries, CMFRI library provides  quality services and CTCRI library fails to meet the quality  expectations of its users.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
With  the  libraries  facing  many  challenges  in  this  competitive  environment,  it  is  indispensable  for  them  to  provide  quality  services  to  their  users.  The  study  assessed  the service quality of ICAR institute libraries from the user’s  
160 
perception  with  a  modifed  SERVQUAL  instrument. it  was  found  that  ICAR  institute  libraries  lack  service  quality.  All  the four libraries have negative gap scores on all dimensions  which defnitely imply that the service quality fall short of user  expectations. While the libraries are compared, only the CMFRI  library  is  showing  quality  to  an  extent  and  CTCRI  library  has  the  least  service  quality.  Library  collection  dimension  was observed as the most signifcant dimension by the users.  The dimension library service has the highest gap and library  staf has the lowest gap. This may be due to the unawareness  about the various services provided and that the libraries were  not  updated  with  latest  technologies.  Therefore,  proper  user  orientation programs, seminars, workshops, etc. should have  to be conducted.  
The  libraries  need  to  take  adequate  measures  for  updating the collection and services periodically. Apart from  this,  budgetary  constraints  are  the  major  issue  faced  by  the  libraries  for  providing  quality  services,  appropriate  fnancial  allocation is essential in resolving it. There should be regular  monitoring on the performance of the libraries. Regular user  need assessment and feedback mechanism should be done for  improving the service quality of libraries. To cope up with the  drastic changes in information and communication technology,  libraries  have  to  be  updated  with  latest  technologies.  The  study pinpoints the areas where quality is to be improved and  concludes  that  libraries  should  focus  on  developing  quality  enhancement practices.
