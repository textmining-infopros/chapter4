ABSTRACT 
Present  work  studies  the  role  of  bibliometric  indicators  and  scientometric  instruments  for  checking  the  qualities of  journals published in the area of construction and building technology. Journal quality review targeted  comparisons between indicators of signifcance and merit from reputable databases. Likewise, present work stressed  on performance of well cited journals and their informational correlations as predicted by selected indicators complex  algorithms. Main research objective focused on review of scientifc journal quality indices that included: Journal  Impact Factor (JIF), Eigenfactor Score (ES), SCImago Journal Rank indicator (SJR) and H5 index. Dependable  construction and building technology journals were chosen from their category within Web of Science. JIFs and  ESs are obtained from Journal Citation Report and the SJR from the SCImago Journal and country rank website.  Sixty one construction and building technology journals were selected for this work and their related data records and  information documents retrieved from their primary sites in relating designated quality indicators (JIF, SJR, ES and  H5). Correlations between indicators were elucidated by means of Pearson’s and Spearman’s statistical correlations  produced by SPSS software. All reclaimed journals are indexed in Web of Science and Scopus citation database.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Now-a-days most of the authors, writers and researchers  are targeting to publish their research fndings and results in  reputable  journals  or  respectable  academic  gatherings  for  accredited  outcomes,  citation  aspects  and  recognition  of  research conducted. This will enhance wider spread of fndings,  attraction  of  joint  team  research,  tapping  for  potentiality  of  patenting  and  competing  for  awards  among  peer  experts,  professional societies and discrete authors. Ibanez1, et al.and  Pajic2 depicted that bibliometric indices are used to evaluate the  importance of research at different levels by funding agencies  and promotion committees. Later, Miller3  illustrated that the  journal should be measured by how well it serves the scientifc  community, the integrity of its review and publication process,  and how it adds to the base of knowledge through high-quality  publications.  
Quality  standards  of  research  and  scientifc  journals  usually  are  gauged  through  frm  scientometric  tools  and  instruments. Such bibliometric indicators and means have their  advantages and drawbacks. Most widely used bibliometric and  scientometric  indicators  include:  Journal  Impact  Factor  or  Eugene Garfeld factor (JIF), Eigenfactor Score (ES), SCImago  
Journal Rank indicator, and H5 indicator (see Fig. 1). Jamali et  al.4, Ahmad5  and Hussain & Swain 
6 suggested that the number  of citations is infuenced by interacting factors such as: journal  history  and  its  indexing  in  an  accredited  database,  rate  of  international cooperation, and country of publication.  
Ramin & Sarraf7 stated that JIF is one of the most used  quality  indicators.  This  indicator  is  calculated  annually  by  dividing  the  number  of  citations  to  articles  published  in  the  journal in the past two years, by the number of articles published  in the journal in the same time frame. However, the indicator  has been criticised for its English-language bias and infuence

of self-citation, Garfeld8 revealed that SCImago Journal Rank  indicator (SJR) indicator is initiated on an algorithm analogous  to google’s PageRank. Citations are based on Scopus database,  over a window of three years. The indicator considers journal  prestige and status, which offers weight to citations for highly  ranked  journals  Walters9 confessed  that  ES,  provides  weight  to  citations  from  highly  ranked  journals  using  an  algorithm  similar to google’s PageRank in its computation. Citations are  based  on  the WoS  database,  covering  a  span  of  three  years.  For each journal articles, the Eigenfactor site reports infuence  score.  
Zarifmahmoudi10, et al.and Jacso11  explained the similar  opinion  for  google  Scholar  and  developed  the  H5  index  for  ranking  publications. A  journal  with  an  index  of  H  has  published at least H articles, each of which has been cited H  times in other articles, for the period of the last fve years. The  launch of google Scholar Metrics has attracted interest in the  scientifc community. 
Shakil,  Islam  &  Akhtar12   studied  a  similar  study  of  bibliometric indicators that are used to appraise quality ranking  for journals using algorithms that are complex and databases.  The  major  objective  of  this  research  work  is  to  determine   quality indices of journal scientifc impact with emphasis on  JIF, ES, and SJR. 
2. RESEARCH OBJECTIVE 
In this research study quality metrics indicators of selected  construction and building technology journals were studied for  any links or discrepancies between their bibliometric factors  as  guided  by  their  respective  JIF,  ES,  SJR  and  H5  index  indicators. 
3. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Sixty one construction and building technology journals  were tested in this research work. Applicable data and relevant  information were collected from their site sources within journal  ranking section of 2015 SCImago and country ranking website  and Web  of  Science  (WoS)  Core  Collection  offcial  website  and  citations,  ISI  and  Scopus-indexed  journals  provided  by  Scopus and google Scholar Citations (gS) metrics under the  category of “Construction and building technology journals”.  Assembled data were used to calculate the journal indicators.  The correlations between obtained indicators were evaluated  using Pearson’s and Pearson’s’ correlation coeffcients using  Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0  release 2012. 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Sixty one esteemed journals of construction and building  technology were searched from the prominent ranking websites  and arranged and indexed in both ISI and Scopus, covering felds  of civil and infrastructure engineering, cement and concrete, air  pollution, building and environment, energy and buildings, steel,  materials  and  structures,  construction  automation,  structural  control and health monitoring, performance simulation, steel  and composite structures, tunnelling, space technology, road  materials and pavement design, lightening, sustainable cities  and society, architectural heritage, tall and special buildings,  
HVAC  &  R  research  computers  and  buildings,  wind  and  structures,  science  and  technology  and  ventilation.  Ranking  of the construction and building technology journals followed  all four indices (IF, ES, SJR, and H5). Correlations between  indices  were  evaluated  using  SPSS  Pearson  and  Spearman  correlations. 
Appendix  ‘A’   shows  detailed  ISI  and  Scopus  indexed  information  for  the  chosen  construction  and  building  technology journals. The table clearly illustrates that very few  of the selected construction and building technology journals  had the same ranking across the selected four indices. As such,  it is diffcult to relate metrics information and measure across  the distinctive indicators. 
As related to JIF, the most cited top three of construction  and building technology journals were (JIF score in parenthesis):  Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering  (5.288),  Indoor Air  (4.33) and  Cement and Concrete Research  (3.48).  These journals were closely followed by  Cement and Concrete  Composites  (3.399).  In  contrast,  the  lowest  citations  were  scored  by  Engineering  Journal-American  Institute  of  Steel  Construction (0.033). 
Top three class journals as per Eigen factor score were  (ES score in parenthesis): Construction and Building Materials  (0.0415), Energy  and  Buildings   (0.02792)  and  Building  and  Environment Journal  (0.01903).  Revista De La Construccion  scored the lowest ES score (0.0009) for the journals chosen for  this study. 
Ranking  of  top  three  journal  as  assessed  by  SJR  (SJR  score  in  parenthesis)  are:  Cement  and  Concrete  Research  Journal  (3.826),  Cement  and  Concrete  Composites  (3.017)  and Building and Environment (2.121). Engineering Journal- American Institute of Steel Construction  tailed the record of  evaluated journals, with SJR scores of 0.125. 
H5  Index  incidentally  coincided  with  JIF  for  ranking  its  top  three  journal  particularly  (H5  index  in  parenthesis):  Energy and Buildings (70),  Building and Environment  (64) and  Building and Environment (60). The trail of journals followed  yet a closer score as is shared by ZKG International and Science  and Technology  for the  Built Environment (5 for each). 
Table  1  shows  a  bivariate  correlation  among  the  four  indicator  (JIF,  ES,  SJR  and  H5)  for  ranking  of  the  selected  construction  and  building  technology  journals. As  shown  in  the  table,  there  is  a  high  Pearson’s  (r)  statistical  correlation

between JIF and H5 and SJR indicators (r =  0.752  and  0.716,  respectively)  and  a  rather  low statistical correlation between JIF and H5  indicators for journals in the selected category  (r = 0.545).  
Spearman’s  rho  statistical  correlation  revealed  a  high  correlation  among  JIF  and  each of SJR and H5 indicators for Construction  and building technology journals (coeffcient  values of 0.848 and 0.799, respectively), while  a  low  correlation  was  recorded  between  JIF  and ES rankings (coeffcient value = 0.776). 
Figure  1  represents  a  bump  chart  for  the top ten (10) JIF-ranked Construction and  building  technology  journals  in  comparison  with their respective ES ranking. Fig. 1 clearly  describes the varying array of ranking of both  indicators for the selected journals. 
Figure 2 depicts a bump chart for the top  ten (10) JIF-ranked construction and building  technology journals in comparison with their  respective  SJR  ranking.  Fig.  2  evidently  describes  the  varying  assortment  of  ranking  of both indicators for the designated journals.  Apart  from   Indoor  Air  and  Materials  and  Structures  journals,  the  rest  kept  their  H5  quality ranks. Building Research & Information  Journal scored high per H5 ranking.

Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) displays  a  stipulated  linear  correlation  between  the  values and ranks of JIF and ES indicators. Fig.  4(c) and  Fig. 4(d) shows a steep relationship  between the values and ranks of JIF and SJR  indices.  Fig.  4(e)  and  Fig.  4(f)  exhibits  the  same correlation between the values and ranks  of JIF and H5. A linear correlation between the  different values of indices (ES versus JIF, and  SJR versus JIF) is clearly shown in the fgures.  Similarly, linearity of relationship is apparent  between  ranks  of  ES  versus  JIF,  SJR  versus  JIF and H5 versus JIF. 
Assembled  research  statistical  data  and  information revealed that sole use of the SJR  index  does  not  warrant  quality  sorting  of  construction and building technology journals  as  compared  to  the  JIF  or  its  technique  of  calculation.  Since  SCImago  Journal  and

Country  Rank  is  a  free  access  source,  this  shows  that  SJR  may be used as an alternative, or in addition, to the JIF for  Construction and building technology journals. Likewise, the  H5 metric would be a reliable tool for quality evaluation of  Construction and building technology journals.  
The four indicator (JIF, ES, SJR and H5) can be employed  in  an  integrated  manner  to  offer  a  more  holistic  and  all- inclusive view of journal quality assessment. This fnding is in  agreement with Ahmad 5, et al.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
In this research work four bibliometric research quality  indices  (JIF,  SJR,  ES  and  H5)  were  examined  and  assessed  for  sixty  one  construction  and  building  technology  journals.  From  the  results  it  can  be  concluded  that  journal  Impact  Factor (JIF) is the chief indicator applied by investigators and  academics  for  ranking  construction  and  building  technology  journals, periodicals, bulletins and publications. JIF, SJR, ES  and H5 indicators are recommended for quality assessment for  construction and building technology journals. Apart from this

bivariate correlation between the four indicator (JIF, ES, SJR  and H5) for ranking of the selected construction and building  technology  journals  show  a  high  Pearson’s  (r)  statistical  correlation  between  SJR  and  JIF  indicators  (r  =  0.752  and  0.716, respectively) for journals in the selected category. This  correlation is lowest between JIF and ES values (r = 0.545). The  Spearman’s rho statistical correlation showed a high correlation  among JIF and each of SJR and H5 indicators for Construction  and building technology journals (coeffcient values of 0.848  and  0.799,  respectively),  while  a  low  correlation  was  noted  between JIF and ES rankings (coeffcient value = 0.776).
