The  present  study  identified  information  access  mechanisms  for  visually  impaired  students  in  select  universities in Delhi, India. Study has ascertained the availability of information and communication technology  (ICT) infrastructure in fve major universities. The study applied purposive sampling method and collected data  through a questionnaire from select universities. It was found that facilities for visually impaired students in higher  educational institutions are very basic and it is diffcult for visually impaired students to conduct study and research  with existing ICT infrastructure. Higher educational institutions in Delhi do not have the infrastructure suited to the  needs of visually impaired students to facilitate effcient services. University libraries in Delhi are facing diffculties  due to lack of funds and trained staff to deliver services to visually impaired students. Library and information  science professionals face inhibits in providing services to visually impaired students because of lack of suitable  equipment(s), ‘maintenance/updating of assistive software(s) and devices, time consuming scanning process and  lack of awareness among visually impaired students about library resources and services.

1. INtrODUctION 
More  than  one  billion  people  i.e.  approximately  15  per cent population worldwide suffer with some type of  disability1. Approximately, 37 million people worldwide  are blind, and nearly 15 million are from India2. Visually  impaired  students  in  higher  educational  institutions  encounter several barriers in getting desired contents for  study and research. Therefore, an inclusive environment  ought  to  be  provided  to  visually  impaired  students  in  order  to  develop  a  ‘sense  of  belonging’  among  students  with  visual  impairment.  A  supportive,  welcoming  and  accepting atmosphere should be provided to them so that  they  feel  comfortable3,4.  Library  professionals  dealing  with  visually  impaired  students  must  have  a  sense  of  empathy  because  it  influences  effective  communication  and understanding between library professionals and users  with special needs. Each library professional responsible  to  provide  services  to  visually  impaired  students  must  learn empathic skills5,6. Library professionals must equip  themselves with empathy so that they can help users with  special  needs  to  achieve  their  objectives  in  academic  institutions. Therefore, LIS professionals should not only  have  good  communication  skills  and  empathy  but  also  knowledge  of  using  assistive  tools  and  technologies,  and  awareness  about  the  information  needs  of  visually

impaired students7. Over the years educational institutions  have been admitting students with visually impairments.  Therefore, it is the responsibilities of the universities to  equip such individuals with the competencies required to  attain key positions. However, in order to achieve these  goals  the  educational  institutions  must  comprehend  the  needs  of  people  with  visual  impairment.  Consequently,  the library and information centres ought to be developed  and  equipped  accordingly  so  that  their  needs  can  be  met8.  In  addition,  understanding  the  information  needs  of visually impaired students would also help to provide  precise, relevant and comprehensive information to visually  impaired students9. Specialised information services that  ought  to  be  provided  to  students  suffering  with  print  disabilities for equal opportunities, lifelong education and  cultural enjoyment10. This  would  help  visually  impaired  students  to  play  an  active  role  in  the  society.  
University libraries must offer the range of information  services  to  all  students  without  discrimination11,12.  The  present study is an attempt to understand information access  mechanisms  available  for  visually  impaired  students  in  university libraries in Delhi. In addition, it aims to know the  online services being provided to students with print disabilities  and procurement methods being used by libraries for assistive  tools and technologies. Study also ascertained the diffculties  faced  by  library  and  information  science  professionals  in  managing information for people with visual impairment.

2.   LItErAtUrE rEVIEW  
Higher  education  is  an  intensively  interactive  social  process and serves the purpose of imparting specifc cognitive  skills and providing relevant information. Its outcome crucially  depends upon the ease with which a learner is able to interact  with teachers, other students and institutional administrators,  and  access  available  information.  On  both  the  parameters,  currently  prevalent  practices  in  higher  education  in  India  are  extremely  unfavourable  for  visually  impaired  students.  Lourens and Swart13  suggested that suitable mechanism pass  on information daily events/programmes must be available in  the institution so that a favourable environment can be created.  Berggren14, et al. stated academicians are not well equipped for  inclusive teaching for visually impaired students. Oppenheim15  developed an application of touch sensors embedded with audio  tags. The technology was tested through a survey on normal and  visually impaired users, and was found benefcial. Therefore,  it is suggested to incorporate the same in commercial devices,  and be coupled with smart phone for the beneft of visually  impaired  users  so  that  they  can  use  the  complex  unfamiliar  devices conveniently.  
Majinge16   revealed  that  libraries  in Tanzania  are  facing  funds  crunch  to  build  the  services  for  people  with  visual  impairments. Shunmugam17  highlighted that there are limited  funds available for people who require special needs education  in higher educational institutions in South Africa. Bodaghi and  Zainab18 described that lack of training for staff in academic  libraries is a major reason that deputed staff fnd diffculties  in  handling  assistive  tools  and  technologies  and  providing  services to people with visual impairments. Bateman19, et al.  found that many devices have been developed but not tested  with visually challenged users. Therefore, it is suggested that  libraries  should  procure  assistive  technologies  after  testing  with  users  with  print  disabilities.  Several  studies  endorsed  that  access  to  information  for  visually  impaired  students  is  a  challenge  because  the  information  is  not  available  in  not  suitable formats20,21.       
Moreover, only limited library websites are accessible to  visually impaired students. Copeland22  revealed that libraries  contribute to the social construction of disability by not building  websites accessible to the visually challenged.  Besides this,  attitude of library staff, lack of research, resources, and training  facilities have been identifed as inhibits to accessible services  in  libraries.  Dim23,  et  al.   revealed  that  marking  menus  are  faster than TalkBack. Further, suggested that marking menus  along  with  motion  gestures  could  assist  in  interacting  with  smartphone. Karabay24 argues that visually impaired students  face  hindrances  with  readers  and  encoders  services  because  of  the  inability  of  the  reader  to  read  clearly  and  smoothly.  Furthermore,  the  study  highlighted  that  readers  provided  to  visually  impaired  students  sometime  unable  to  pronounce  terms correctly if they are from a different discipline.  
Günal25   identifed  in  his  study  that  arrangement  of  the  examination setting and inability of the examiner to manage  it are major hindrance faced by students with print disabilities.  Such  students  encounter  problems  in  commuting  because  of  lack  of  public  transportation  within  the  campus.  Munyi26 revealed  that  teaching  Braille  and  print  reading  and  writing  
388 
would beneft a lot for people with low vision. Nzoka27  studied  profciency of primary school teachers in English and Braille in  special schools in Kenya and discovered lack of Braille skills  among teachers. Ndung’u28  described that ‘Braille represents  competence,  independence  and  equality  and  Braille  would  always be a medium of literacy for persons with disability’.  Visually  impaired  people  largely  depend  on  their  hands  and  identify  the  surrounding  by  touching  objects  with  cane.  However, the coverage area using cane is limited and visually  impaired persons collide and face hardship in daily routine in  academic institutions29,30. To counter this problem a study by  Cecílio31, et al.   proposed indoor systems namely BlinDroid  that offer navigations assistance describes the places, products  and services to the visually impaired. It detects the locations  through signals from beacons that are pre-installed within the  building. Nonetheless, the system has limitation that it does not  work in case of absence of beacons in the building. Another  study  by  Filpe32, et  al.    demonstrated  that  visually  impaired  person using Microsoft Kinect sensor close to his or her chest  can get appropriate image of the nearby area. Subsequently,  the  system  mainly  classifes  the  images  into  one  of  four  categories namely no obstacle, obstacle ahead (wall), upstairs  or downstairs. The images can be pre-processed in real time  using neural network technique.

4.   MEtHODOLOGY AND ScOPE 
Questionnaire  method  was  used  in  data  collection  with  purposive sampling technique. The questionnaire was prepared  after a pilot study. The fnal questionnaire had 45 questions. Prior  to circulation among librarians, reliability of the questionnaire  was tested using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS)  version 19. The questionnaire included dichotomous questions,  multiple choice and open ended questions. The questionnaire  is categorised in three sections wherein the frst section seeks  general information while the second related to awareness of  library resources and services. The third section deals with the  requirements of developing an online information system for  visually impaired students. The questions are designed to elicit  the experience of respondents about the following aspects:

5.    r ESULtS AND ANALYSIS  
The  responses  received  through  the  questionnaire  were  analysed and presented in Tables and Figure.  
5.1.  Digital  Infrastructure  for  Personal  Use  
a   dichotomous  question  was  asked  whether  suffcient  digital infrastructure for visually impaired students is available  in  the  institutions.  Respondents  were  asked  to  reveal  which  equipment(s) their institutions provide personally to visually  impaired students. It was found that none of the institutions  in Delhi provides all nine equipment(s) listed in the question.  University of Delhi provides fve equipment(s) namely ‘laptop’,  ‘smart phone’, ‘talking book device’, ‘lecture recorder’, ‘hard  disk’, ‘portal scanner’, Internet can be accessed through wi- fi by visually impaired students. Jawaharlal Nehru University,  New  Delhi  also  provides  fve  equipment(s)  for  personal  use  namely,  laptop’,  ‘talking  book  device’,  ‘lecture  recorder’,  ‘portable hard disk’ and ‘portable scanner’. Response to the  question  by  Jamia  Millia  Islamia  revealed  that  university  provides ‘Internet through wi-Fi’, ‘talking book device’, ‘hard  disk  to  store  data’  and  ‘portable  scanner’.  It  was  found  that  ambedkar University Delhi and Indira gandhi National open  University provides the minimum ICT infrastructure personally  to visually impaired students. These two universities provide  only  ‘talking  book  device’  and  ‘Internet  through  wi-Fi’  to  visually impaired students.

5.3  Face-to-face  Services  being  Provided  to  Visually  
Impaired  Students  
A question was asked to the respondent regarding services  being provided to visually impaired students. Table 2 illustrates  that  DU  is  providing  face-to-face  services.  DU  provides  seven  services  viz.  ‘ICT  capability  services’,  ‘reference  service’, ‘transcription service’, ‘talking dictionary’, ‘Braille  translation’,  ‘large  print  production’,  ‘document  delivery  service’, ‘screen reading enabled library catalogue’ followed  by JNU which provided seven services out of the eight listed  in the table, JmI provides six services, IgNoU also provides  the six services. The lowest number of face-to-face services are  being provided by aUD i.e. 4 services.   
5.4  Inhibits  Faced  by  LIS  Professionals  in  
Providing  Online resources  and  Services 
Libraries  in  higher  educational  institutions  encounter  several  problems  in  delivering  services  to  visually  impaired  students.  Nawe33   elaborated  that  fund  crunch  is  a  major  problem  with  libraries  worldwide  providing  services  to  visually impaired. Brophy and Craven34  explained that library  information  technology  (IT)  systems  and  interfaces  must  be  user-friendly so that people with visual impairment can read  and  interact  conveniently.  Table  3  depicts  inhibits  faced  by

The  Study  also  identifed  problems  faced  by  university  libraries  in  managing  open  access  resources  for  visually  impaired students. Table 4 shows that no problem is listed as  common among fve universities. moreover, four universities  except JNU stated that ‘interface of open access resource is  not designed as per VI students’ is the major problem. JNU,  DU  and  JmI  libraries  mentioned  that  open  access  resources  are  incomplete.  Two  libraries  namely  JNU  and  IgNoU  indicated that open access resources are not updated regularly  which is another problem faced by libraries in managing open  access resources. only one library i.e. JNU stated open access  resources  are  not  organised  properly. only  DU  opined  that  open access resources are less user-friendly.

5.6  Procurement  methods  for Assistive tools  and  
technologies  
A question was posed in the questionnaire to understand  the method of procuring assistive tools and technologies for  visually impaired students. It was asked whether the libraries  consult the visually impaired students prior to procurement of  assistive tools and technologies for them. The responses were  analysed and dataset shows that all the libraries (100 %) consult  the  visually  impaired  students  prior  to  procure  the  assistive  tools and technologies for them.  All libraries (100 %) follow  the  group  discussion  method  and  all  the  libraries  excluding  aUD indicated that demonstration of tools and technology is  another method they follow prior to procuring assistive tools  and technologies.  Trial method is also being followed by all the  libraries except DU. lecture method is being followed by JNU,  DU and IgNoU. Consultation through e-mail is done by JNU,  DU and IgNoU. Seeking suggestions through library website  is  also  followed  by  JNU,  DU  and  IgNoU.  Disseminating  Information and seeking response through notice board is only  followed by DU.

IgNoU  only  offers  Braille  books  and  talking books in DaISy  format and  aUD provides no in-house  material to visually impaired students.  
     
Institutions  
Bodaghi and Zainab37  pointed out that academic libraries  do  not  have  suitable  assistive  technologies  to  assist  visually  challenged  students  especially  to  convert  print  to  Braille  and  recorder  to  create  audio  corrections.  Carson38   pointed  out  the  case of people with visual impairment facing inhibits in using the  information resources in alternative format such as, large text,  braille books, audio books, and suggested that these should be  provided to them. Table 7 shows that JMI is the leading institution  and it has 8 equipment(s) out of the total 23 listed, followed by

JNU (7), DU, and IgNoU (4) equipment(s) each. aUD has only  one equipment out of the 23 listed.  Therefore, the availability of  assistive equipment(s) in higher educational institutions in Delhi  is discouraging. It is cumbersome for visually impaired students  to do study with ease using very basis facilities in universities.  It shows that authorities in these institutions are not spending  suffcient funds to build the necessary infrastructure for visually  impaired students.   
5.11 Availability  of Assistive  Software(s)    
Sarı39   expressed  that  visually  impaired  students  not

benefted  from  library  because  library  resources  because  libraries do not arrange the tools according to disability and  embossed documents. Therefore, libraries in higher educational  institutions  must  arrange  tools  and  resources  accordingly  to  disability of users and should offer a variety of services for  students  with  special  needs.  Students’  suffering  from  visual  disability must be provided services in same way as normal  students40. Respondents were asked to reveal the availability of  assistive software(s) in higher educational institutions in Delhi.  Table  8  shows  that  JMI  has  the  highest  number  of  assistive  software(s) 8 out of 18 listed in the Table viz. SAFA Reader,  Open  Book,  Read  Easy+,  JAwS  Screen  Reader,  Vaachak,  magic  Prof  magnifcation,  Talking  Typing  Teacher,  Infty  reader and Chatty Infty.

5.12  Orientation  Programme  and  its  Scope  
library  orientation  has  signifcant  impact  in  usage  of  library  sources  and  services.  More  importantly,  visually  impaired  students  can  beneft  immensely  if  orientation  programmes  are  conducted  systematically.  Therefore,  a  dichotomous question was asked to know whether the library  conduct orientation programme for visually impaired students  or not. It was found that all the libraries conduct orientation  programme for visually impaired students. Further, it was asked  to specify the components of orientation programme such as,  assistive software(s), assistive hardware(s), library resources,  library services, library tour, library rules and regulations, open  access resources and usage of library catalogue. It was found

BHARDwAJ: INformaTIoN aCCESS mECHaNISm for VISUally ImPaIrED  S TUDENTS IN  H IgHEr EDUCaTIoNal INSTITUTIoNS 
that JNU, DU, JmI and IgNoU cover all the components in  the  orientation  programme.  A  assistive  hardware(s),  library  tour are not included in the orientation of aUD.    
The  third  section  of  the  questionnaire  is  related  to  the  requirements  of  information  system  for  visually  impaired  students.  Therefore,  it  was  attempted  to  understand  what  
table 9. Online training 
kind of information system is required for visually impaired  
students.  
5.13 contents  to  be  Incorporated  in  ISVI 
Responses were sought to understand the type of materials  to be incorporated in information system for visually impaired  (ISVI).  The  responses  were  analysed  and  it  was  found  that  E-books and E-Magazines are the most preferred material. All  the fve university libraries asked to include these two types of  contents. In addition, all the respondents stated that they need  that information on the notice board must be included in the  ISVI. four universities namely JNU, DU, JmI, and IgNoU  advocated to include E-syllabi and question papers. News are  also useful information which visually impaired students need  on daily basis. Thus, it was asked by all the universities except  JmI to include news in the information system. JNU, DU and  IgNoU libraries responses also suggested including research  articles in the information system. JNU and DU libraries asked  to incorporate scholarship details, audio contents, books review  in  the  proposed  information  system  for  visually  impaired  students.   
5.14  Help  Features  
Study also ascertained help features to be included in the  ISVI. a  multiple choice question was asked giving fve choices  viz., peer help, online chat, help of librarian online, frequent  asked questions (FAQs), E-mail and discussion forum. It was  found that all the fve universities libraries responses except  JMI  demand  to  have  e-mail  communication  with  students  in  ISVI.  four  libraries  namely  JNU,  JmI,  IgNoU,  aUD  responses asked to include ‘online chat’ in the proposed system.  In addition, IgNoU and aUD wished to have faQ facility in  the system. Three university libraries namely JmI, IgNoU and  aUD advocated to have ‘online librarian help’ feature in the  ISVI.   
5.15  Online training  
Another dichotomous question was posed to know whether  to include online training or not in the ISVI . Respondents were  asked to choose the mode of online training for the proposed  ISVI  and  four  options  were  indicated  viz.  ‘email’,  ‘online  tutorial’,  ‘instant  chat’,  and  ‘multimedia  contents’.  Table  9  illustrates  that  ‘online  tutorial’  is  the  most  preferred  mode  of online training as suggested by respondents. Except aUD  all the respondent libraries opted to include the same in the  proposed ISVI. Email is preferred by three university libraries  namely  JNU,  DU  and  IgNoU.  JmI  and  IgNoU  advocated  for  inclusion  of  ‘multimedia  contents’  for  online  training  for visually impaired students. ‘Instant chat’ is suggested by  IgNoU library to incorporate in online training for ISVI.

6.  DIScUSSIONS AND cONcLUSIONS  
Visually impaired students face diffculties in socializing  and seeing value in the social environment with other students  in higher educational institutions. low self-confdence is major  cause for this problem. Since, visually impaired students’ face  diffculties in traveling others and reaching at the right place at  right time are this posing a challenge in socializing with others41.  JNU is found to be the leading university and it provides seven  out of eight online services listed in the questionnaire, followed  by  JmI  providing  four  online  services,  and  DU  and aUD  provide only two online services to visually impaired students.  It is apparent that libraries in higher educational institutions  have  not  updated  their  services.  Only  three  universities  provide selective dissemination of information (SDI) service  to their visually impaired students. Study found that only two  universities  namely  JNU  and  IgNoU  organise  specialised  orientation programmes and library tour. This shows lack of  seriousness  of  the  remaining  three  universities  in  providing  services to visually impaired students.   
furthermore, study found DU and IgNoU facilitate their  students with volunteer readers. Three universities do not have  such service and it is apparent that they are failing to channelise  the help of other students to the community. All the libraries  have provision of inter library loan (ILL) facility. Nevertheless,  visually impaired students may not be aware of such services.  Thus,  libraries  ought  to  organise  meeting  with  students  on  periodic  basis  to  disseminate  the  information  about  services  and resources. The education process is diffcult for visually  impaired because of their requirements for various devices42.  Unstandardised websites are diffcult to access with any kind  of  assistive  technology. Therefore,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  librarians to develop websites keeping in mind the needs of  visually impaired students so that these websites can be accessed  with ease using assistive technologies. Main problems being  faced  by  librarians  in  providing  services  are  funds  crunch,  trained staff to deliver services, lack of suitable equipment(s),  and maintenance/updating of assistive software(s) and devices.  In  addition,  scanning  is  a  time  consuming  process  and  this  because major diffcult in the absence of suitable manpower.  Study  also  found  that  visually  impaired  students  are  less  aware  about  library  resources  and  services.  Consequently,  library  resources  and  services  are  not  being  used  optimally  by  visually  impaired  students.  It  was  found  that  JMI  is  the  leading institution and it has eight equipment(s) out of the total  twenty three listed. remaining libraries have JNU (7), DU and  IgNoU (4) equipment(s) each. Surprisingly, aUD has only one  equipment out of the 23 listed. It shows that infrastructure for  visually impaired students in higher educational institutions is  
393

DJLIT,  VOL.  38,  NO.  6, NOV   2018 
pathetic. Academic libraries in Delhi also have limited assistive  software(s) and it found that JMI has the highest eight assistive  software(s).  DU  has  fve  assistive  software(s),  followed  by  JNU (4), aUD (2). IgNoU has only one assistive software(s).  Indian  libraries  lag  far  behind  in  providing  advanced  ICT  based services, procuring assistive equipment(s) and assistive  software(s) for visually impaired students compared to western  libraries. The  study  will  be  useful  to  understand  the  present  situation  of  higher  education  institution  libraries  providing  services  to  visually  impaired  students.  The  fndings  will  be  useful  to  authorities  of  higher  educational  institutions,  funding agencies, policy makers to develop infrastructure in  academic libraries for visually impaired students. Accredited  and funding agencies can also utilise the fndings of the study  in accreditation and grading of higher educational institutions.   Besides  this,  designers  of  open  access  and  commercial  IT  resources can also beneft from the study to make the resources  complaint with assistive tools and technologies.
