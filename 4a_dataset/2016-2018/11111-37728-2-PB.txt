 This study examined the perception and usage pattern of e-book among LIS undergraduate students from  selected  fve universities. Questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondents. Five research questions  were developed and answered. The fndings demonstrate  that LIS undergraduate students still use e-books more  compare to print books. The results also reveal that LIS undergraduate students have positive perception of e-book  as it enhance learning effectiveness, assist to fnish course content/outline; makes reading faster; easy to use and  with clear graphical illustrations. The usage pattern of e-books among LIS undergraduate students is majorly for  research purpose and the majority is highly satisfed with reading e-books. The major problem encountered by the  students with e-books is the diffculties reading on the computers or internet, followed by the cost of e-book reader.   The study recommended based on these fndings that university authority and library of the participating institutions  should make e-books readers available in large quantity. Doing so is assumed will increase the use of e-books  and  
further arouse the interest of the students .

1. INtrodUctIoN 
The  term  electronic  book  (e-book)  is  used  to  describe  many  different  kinds  of  digital  books.  An  electronic  book  is  popularly  called  e-book,  digital  book,  or  e-edition  of  a  printed  book.  E-book  is  a  book-length  publication  in  digital  form,  consisting  of  text,  images,  or  both  that  are  readable  on  computers  or  other  electronic  devices.  Many  academic  institutions  such  as  in  Nigeria  are  already  in  the  process  of  implementing the use of e-books within learning, teaching and  research activities. Institutions that have implemented the use  of e-books in Nigeria include Covenant University, Landmark  and other universities. These make use of range of devices and  platforms to enable learners have access and use e-books to  support their learning and research activities. The functionality  and accessibility of e-book service requires database. E-book  databases  are  making  its  way  into  libraries  through  popular  providers such as NetLibrary, Books 24x7, Questia & Ebrary1.  
E-books can be enhanced with other electronic features  such  as  embedded  hyperlinks  bookmarks,  annotation,  text  searching  and  the  linking  of  complex  multimedia  objects  which  may  also  be  of  great  assistance  for  those  with  disabilities2. Due to the penetration of e-book, libraries such as  academic libraries have traditionally played an important role  in  providing  access  to  and  disseminating  information  across  learning  and  research  communities. That  role  has  now  been  extended to facilitating access to electronic resources such as

e-journals and e-books through innovative technologies. More  so, libraries have begun to turn to provision of e-book services  largely because of decreasing budget, limited shelving space,  increasing cost of new building and resources, the rising cost  of repair or replacement of printed books, increasing demand  from users of electronic resources, rising cost of inter-library  loan service and the demand to support distance or distributed  learning needs3.  
Furthermore,  e-book  is  a  technological  advancement  in  which texts are prepared in digital environment that can be read  on specially designed devices to enhance and support learning  activities and transform the scholarly engagement. As these types  of environments became popular and preferable by many; it is  important to discuss its advantages and disadvantages. E-books  have some advantages over printed books, such as settings and  particular purposes. Fundamentally, two of the most popular  advantages for using e-books include their ‘searchability’ and  the availability 24 hours a day. E-book readers can fnd specifc  content  more  easily  and  more  effciently  than  in  a  printed  book4. This is possible due to the fact that e-book comprises a  digital body primarily of text with a defned scope. Considering  the fact that students have to carry loads of books to school  every day, but e-books have overshadowed this disadvantage  as hundreds of books are stored on a fash disk. Studies have  reported that carrying heavy school bags at early ages causes  waist and joint disorders in the later years5.  
Essentially,  e-book  enable  individuals  to  easily  fnd  information  and  to  determine  whether  a  book’s  content  is

appropriate  without  having  to  make  a  trip  to  the  library,  an  e-book’s time-saving benefts are clear on account of the ease  with  which  users  fnd  the  e-book. gibson  & gibb6   pointed  out that students like the lightness and portability of e-book  devices, as well as navigation capability, ease of use, storage  capacity,  and  the  use  of  e-ink  for  displaying  content  on  the  screen. Considering the effciency of e-book kelly7  anticipated  that, in the near future, ‘all new works will be born digital’. 
E-book  which  served  as  a  medium  for  delivering  information  content  online  has  become  popular  and  has  entered the mainstream consciousness of the general public.  Sales  of  e-readers  such  as  kindles  and  I-Pads  have  been  increasing rapidly. Through this expansion of sales, the general  public including students has gained better understanding of  what an e-book is, the advantages that the e-book can bring  to reading, and the issues that can arise when using e-books  and  e-readers.  Furthermore,  the  provision  of  e-books  does  not  require  unpacking,  processing,  shelving,  and  eliminate  the extra time previously required to handle and process them  before they can be used8,9  . Features for handling e-books are  also becoming user friendly, making it fairly easy for readers  to browse, navigate, able to view graphics, videos or submit  keywords and undertake full text searching within a book or a  collection of books10. Commercially produced and sold e-books  are usually intended to be read on dedicated e-book readers,  however,  almost  any  sophisticated  electronic  device  that  have the features of a controllable viewing screen, including  computers, tablet computers, and smart phones and boards can  also be used to read e-books. At a basic level, e-books can be  released in a plain text format, as was originally the case in  1971  at  the  start  of  Project gutenberg.  Snowhill10   confrms  this in a report on an evaluation of e-books undertaken by a  taskforce  of  the  California  Digital  Library  in  2000.  Rao11 provides background information on e-books, including their  advantages  and  disadvantages  in  an  educational  context  and  describe how the publication of e-books on a commercial basis  is gaining momentum in India. Therefore, it is incontestable  that e-books are information materials that play a signifcant  role  in  the  life  of  individuals  especially  the  undergraduate  students based on the benefts earlier mentioned.  
Basically,  it  is  of  great  importance  to  also  determine  undergraduates’  perception  of  e-books,  which  signifcantly  judge  and  show  the  usage  pattern.  Perception  is  the  insight,  idea or opinion someone have about something which can be  a negative or positive idea. For example, e-book readers have  trouble  estimating  the  length  of  sentences. There  is  also  the  perception that graphics or tables are harder to read on screen  than  on  paper12.  Some  studies  have  also  indicated  that  the  positive perception of e-books is associated with accessibility  and  availability13,14.  Talking  about  e-book  usage  by  users,  the  level  of  perception  of  e-book  by  the  user  which  could  be negative or positive perception will have great effect and  infuence on the usage. Hernon15, et al. examined ‘e-book use  patterns’ and found that students do not view an e-book in the  same way that they viewed a printed book. The study indicated  that moving from page to page on an e-book is tedious, and  it is diffcult to fnd specifc chapters in the text or to locate  particular words, and these diffculties have a negative impact  
on students’ perceptions towards the usage of e-books. Based  on  the  understanding  that  e-book  provides  easy  access  for  retrieval  of  information  which  is  crucial  to  the  survival  of  human existence, this study aims at examining the perception  and use pattern of e-book among LIS undergraduate students  in fve different academic institutions in Nigeria 
Several studies that focused on e-book usage discovered  that  despite  increased  awareness  of  the  existence  of  e-book  technology  in  general,  it  has  been  observed  that  perception  and usage pattern in many academic libraries in Nigeria and  African countries as a whole seem to be very limited. Whereas,  determining  the  perception  and  usage  pattern  will  enable  libraries  to  know  what  efforts  to  put  to  improve  collections  on their e-books. For example, a study conducted by Ismail  &  Zainab16,  proved  that  e-books,  bibliographic  databases  and  e-journals  were  at  a  very  low  level  of  usage  by  faculty  members at the United Arab Emirates University. A number  of fndings point to the transitional nature of academic reading  practices infuenced by the emergence of e-books and e-readers.  one  of  such  fnding  illustrates  a  lack  of  established  views/ perceptions of the e-book or e-reader phenomena. Briddon17,  et al. supported the fnding and pointed to the fact that there  is a need to understand ‘how people perceive e-books and in  what context they may have been (unknowingly) using them’.  A  cursory  observation  by  the  author  of  this  study  revealed  that  most  of  the  studies  mentioned  above  were  conducted  outside Nigeria and even Africa. This confrm that there have  been  limited  studies  that  examined  pattern  of  e-book  usage  among undergraduate library and information science students  particularly  in  the  Nigerian  university  context.  For  these  reasons  therefore,  this  study  focused  on  the  perception  and  usage pattern of e-books among LIS undergraduate students in  fve academic institutions in Nigeria.

Chu’s38  after studying 27 libraries and information science  students’ use and experience with e-books reported that library  and information science students were reluctant to use them,  instead  preferring  printed  books  because  it  was  considered  easier to read and did not require specialized equipment and  indicated that the primary reason for not using e-books was the  diffculty of moving within an e-book. A study by Walters39,  with  data  collected  from  2,067  university  students,  faculty,  and  staff,  indicated  that,  although  e-books  are  heavily  used,  students still report issues with reading materials on a screen  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time.  Hernon15,  et  al.  examined  ‘e-book  use  patterns’  and  found  that  students  do  not  view  an e-book in the same way that they viewed a printed book  – The study indicated that moving from page to page on an  e-book is tedious, and it is diffcult to fnd specifc chapters  in the text or to locate particular words, and these diffculties  have a negative impact on students’ perceptions towards the  usage of e-books. 
Briddon17,  et  al.   used  online  survey,  interview  and  observation  methods  to  understand  how  e-books  were  used  in  a  large  university  library  in  the  Uk.  The  authors  found  that  e-book  use  among  students  was  infuenced  by  faculty  (assigned/recommended  readings),  and  also  by  such  e-book  features as accessibility and ease of use. E-book adoption by  business  faculty,  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  was  examined by Stamison18. The fndings indicate that the quick  rate of e-book adoption could be linked to Business research  demands for quick identifcation and extraction of specifc data.  More recently, a focus group study of university lecturers by  Carlock & Perry14 found that academics avoided recommending  e-books  because  of  worries  over  reliability  and  technical  constraints.  Wilson  and  Landoni19   found  that  e-books  were  mistrusted until study deadlines forced usage. In a study on the  survey of e-book usage and perceptions at the University of  Liverpool, it was discovered that e-books were used primarily  for study and for research. Undergraduate students use e-books  almost equally for study (80 %) and for research (71 %). Not  surprisingly, Faculty members have somewhat different usage  habits,  accessing  e-books  less  frequently  for  study  purposes  (31 %) but much more often for research (85 %). In addition,  nearly 50 % of Faculty members access e-books for training  purposes,  primarily  the  preparation  of  course  and  teaching  materials.  
Nicholas23, et  al.   reported  in  their  study  that  80  %  of  British  graduate  students  used  e-books  compared  to  only  62  %  of  undergraduates.  Undergraduate  students  have  been  typically driven by class assignments while graduate students  concentrated on research and teaching. A study conducted by  gibbon24  found that undergraduate students have the highest  preference  for  print  books  (53  %);  many  undergraduate  respondents commented on the diffculty they have learning,  retaining,  and  concentrating  while  in  front  of  a  computer.  gibbon24   also  found  out  that  41  %  of  respondents  rate  the  option to purchase a printed copy of an e-book as an important  feature, implying that utilisation of the service should witness  an  upward  trend.  gibson  also  found  that  Springer  e-book  usage is impacted by both university status and area of study  
134 
or  research.  Postdoctoral  researchers  were  found  to  have  used  Springer  e-books  (51%);  and  graduate  students  (49  %); faculty and lectures (32 %); and undergraduate students  (20  %).  springer’s  e-books  were  used  by  respondents  in  the  physical  science  and  engineering  (62  %);  in  life  and  health  science (39 %); social science (32 %); business and law (18  %); and arts and humanities (17 %). Ismail & Zainab16, proved  that  e-books,  bibliographic  databases  and  e-journals  were  at  a very low level of usage by faculty members at the United  Arab  Emirates University,  which  might  relate  to  the  lack  of  awareness about the e-resources provided by the library or the  ineffective channels of communication in campus. 
The  study  on  the  level  of  satisfaction  of  students  with  e-book usage was also carried out by Walter25  which one third  (36 %) of the respondent were highly satisfed, over half (55  %) were less satisfed and less than 10 % were not satisfed.  And a survey found that faculty members from Humanities ,  Economics and Social Sciences use online catalogues, full-text  electronic  journal  databases  (e-journal)  and  abstracting  and  indexing databases most frequently and they are expected to  use them more extensively in the future20. Helfer26  carried out a  study on the rate of e-resources use and the fnding reveals that  the use rate of e-resources was extremely low.  
Hilsund27   interviewed  3200  faculty  members,  undergraduates as well as graduate students and observed that  e-books were used for research, teaching and learning. A high  percentage of users, however, still indicated preference for printed  books and journals. Folb20, et al.  examined e-book usage by the  Health Science students and professionals and concluded that all  groups of users had fexible attitudes toward print and electronic  media and valued whatever sources that provides them with  needed information.  
In great Britain, research has indicated slow acceptance  of nearly all digital textual resources other than journals. Study  revealed  that  the  past  usage  of  e-books  is  very  signifcantly  related  to  preference  of  e-book  for  reading  as  a  reference  book. As observed by Summerfeld & Mandel29 that publishing  professionals preferred e-versions of reference materials, such  as  manuals,  encyclopedias,  maps  and  travel  guides.  Helfer26 indicated that the slow acceptance of e-book is due to users  wanting to use e-books just as a reference resource, to look  for the answers they want and sent the book back. Comparing  e-book use to users’ ages, Anderson30  surveyed 1500 US online  Internet users found that those who frequent the Internet also  rated e-book positively and they tended to be between the ages  of  25  and  29.  Bodomo31,  et  al.   reported  the  minimal  use  of  e-books in students’ works that students are not familiar with  copyright  regulations  governing  digital  materials,  and  they  are  uncertain  of  the  extent  they  can  make  copies  of  digital  resources and also, due to their lack of information skills on  how  to  cite  electronic  sources  used  in  their  writings.  Ismail  and Zainab16  found that students who were heavy users of the  internet had more positive attitudes towards e-books, but their  level of usage was still low.

4.1   r esearch design 
The research design adopted for this study is descriptive  

========3========

ADEyINkA, et al.: PERCEPTIoN AND USAgE  P ATTERN  o F E-BookS AMoNg LIBRARy AND  I NFoRMATIoN  S CIENCE  U NDERgRADUATE 
survey. This was to fnd out the perception and usage pattern of  e-books among the undergraduate students in fve (5) selected  universities in Nigeria offering BSc in library and information  science  or  related  degree.  Survey  design  was  considered  appropriate for this study because it allows the collection of  data using questionnaire. 
4.2 Population  of  the  Study 
The targeted population for this study is the undergraduate  students of library and information science from fve (5) selected  universities  which  are:  University  of  Ilorin,  Ilorin;  Babcock  University, Ilisan; Tai Solarin University, Ijagun; University of  Ibadan, Ibadan, and kwara State University, Malete.  
4.3 Sample  and  Sampling technique 
The sampling technique adopted for this study is simple  random sampling as every respondent in the population of the  study  have  equal  chance  of  being  selected.  Simple  random  sampling  as  the  basic  sampling  method  of  survey  research  which aims to give each person in the sampling frame equal  chance  of  being  included  in  the  sample.  Fifty  (50)  LIS  undergraduate students from each institution were selected as  sample  for  the  study  given  a  total  of  two  hundred  and  ffty  (250) LIS undergraduate students which represent the sample  for the study. 
4.4   d ata collection  Instruments 
The  instrument  used  for  this  study  was  a  self-designed  questionnaire  titled  Questionnaire  on  the  ‘perception  and  usage pattern of e-book among LIS undergraduate students’.  Questionnaire  have  been  known  to  be  one  of  the  most  common  research  instruments  for  data  collection  and  this  is  used mainly to gather useful and important data in the area of  attitude and opinion of respondents. The questionnaire consists  of  six  sections.  Section  1  to  gather  biographical  data  of  the  respondents such as age, gender, year of study and Faculty etc.  Section 2 on perception of e-book, Section 3 on the problems  encountered  while  using  e-books,  Section  4  on  the  level  of  satisfaction  of  LIS  undergraduate  students  with  the  use  of  e-books, Section 5 on the usage pattern of e-books, Section 6  on preferences for e-books.  
4.5   d ata collection  Procedure 
The questionnaire on the perception and usage pattern of  e-book  among  LIS  undergraduate  students  in  fve  academic  institutions in Nigeria was administered to the respondents by  the researcher after seeking permission from the appropriate  school  authority.  The  questionnaire  was  self-administered  by  the  researcher  to  LIS  undergraduate  students  in  the  fve  selected  academic  institutions  used  for  the  study. A  total  of  ffty (50) questionnaires were administered in each of the fve  academic institutions making a total of 250 questionnaires that  were administered, out of which 175 were returned completely  flled  and  useful  for  data  analysis  thereby  representing  70%  return rate. The return rate of the questionnaire was affected  because it was administered during examination period in all  the participating schools.  
4.6   v alidity  of  Instruments 
To determine the validity of the questionnaire used in this  study, it was given to two experts in library and information  science who reviewed the questionnaire in order to determine  the  appropriateness,  contents  coverage,  adequacy  and  relevance to the stated objectives. The comments, suggestions  and corrections by the experts were incorporated to produce a  fnal draft of the questionnaire which was fnally administered  to the respondents.  
4.7   r eliability  of  Instruments 
Reliability  of  Instruments  is  the  degree  of  consistency  and  accuracy  with  which  an  instrument  measure  what  it  claims  to  measure.  This  was  achieved  by  administering  the  questionnaire to nineteen (19) undergraduate students of the  department of Economics in University of Ilorin, kwara State,  Nigeria.  Responses  collected  were  subjected  to  Cronbach  alpha. The overall reliability of the questionnaire returned r =  0.71. This was considered high enough for data collection in  this study. 
4.8 Methods  of data Analysis  
Collected data based on the questionnaire administration  was  analyzed  using  descriptive  statistics  to  generate  mean,  percentage and frequency which were used to ensure better and  clear explanation of the outcome of the study. 
5.   dA tA   Pre SeNtAtIoN ANd ANALYSIS 
The  demographic  information  of  respondents  in  this  study revealed that respondents from University of Ilorin were  40(22.9 %); 36 (20.6 %) were from kwara State University;  43(24.6  %),  were  from  University  of  Ibadan;  37(21.1  %)  were from Babcock University and 19(10.9 %) were from Tai  Solarin University. This fnding indicates that majority Library  and Information Science students who participated in the study  were from University of Ibadan.  
on the year of study of the respondents, the result revealed  that 25(14.3 %) were in their year 1 while 45(25.7 %) were in  their year 2 and 39(22.3 %), 61(34.9 %), 5(2.9 %) were in their  year 3, year 4 and year 5 respectively. This fnding indicates  that  the  respondents  in  their  year  4  were  the  majority.  On  gender, the Table 1 shows that 79 (45.1 %) were male while  96 (54.9 %) were female. The age distribution of respondents  revealed that 65(37.1 %) were between the age of 16-20 years,  88  (50.3  %)  were  between  the  age  of  21-25  years,  21(12.0  %) were between the age of 26-30 years and 1 (0.6 %) were  between the age of 31-35 years.

Also, a total of 121(69.1 %) strongly agreed that e-book  usage  gives  them  control  when  reading  and  makes  their  reading faster while 28 (16.0 %) were undecided and 26(14.9  
%) strongly disagreed. In addition, 43(18.9 %) strongly agreed  that use of e-book will be unproductive due to poor internet  connection in the school while 26(14.9 %) were undecided and  116(66.3 %) strongly disagreed. Furthermore, a total of 76(43.5  %)  strongly  agreed  and  agreed  that  using  e-books  for  their  course  is  not  compulsory  while  28(16.0  %)  were  undecided  and a total of 71(40.5 %) of the students strongly disagreed and  disagreed. A total of 121(69.2 %) strongly agreed and agreed  that e-books are easy to use while 32(18.3 %) were undecided  and a total of 22(12.5 %) strongly disagreed. Also, 60(34.3 %)  strongly  agreed  that  they  cannot  read  e-books  on  screen  for  a long time while a total of 26(14.9 %) of the students were  undecided and 89(50.9 %) strongly disagreed. Also, 71(40.6  %) of the respondents strongly agreed and 71(40.6 %) strongly  disagreed that they don’t fnd it easy to maintain attention and  concentration  when  using  e-books  while  33(18.9  %)  were  undecided. Finally, 131(74.8 %) strongly agreed that e-books  have  clear  graphical  illustrations  which  aid  learning  and  30(17.1 %) were undecided 14(8.0 %) strongly disagreed.  
A  benchmark  of  total  grand  mean  score  3.43  was  used  to  determine  the  whether  the  perception  of  e-book  by  LIS  undergraduate students is negative or positive. This is done by  comparing the mean of individual item with the grand mean.  The  result  reveals  that  LIS  undergraduate  students  have  the  perception that e-book enhance learning effectiveness, assist to  fnish course content/outline; gives control and makes reading  faster; easy to use and with clear graphical illustrations. All of  these are considered as positive perception of e-books by the  respondents because their mean are above the grand mean.  
Question  2:  What  is  the  level  of  LIS  undergraduate  students’ preference for e-books? 
The  Table  3  provides  answer  to  the  second  research  question.  The  results  on  the  table  reveals  that  the  entire  respondents  175  (100  %)  indicated  they  use  e-books.  As  a

rider to get additional information, respondents were asked to  indicate whether or not they prefer the e-books to print book.  The results demonstrated that 164(93.7 %) of the respondents  prefer using e-books compared to 1(6.3 %) who prefer using  printed  books.  Also  the  fnding  reveals  the  most  preferred  e-book format where 19 respondents (10.9 %) indicated they  prefer TEXT format; 15(8.6 %) prefer HTML format; 20(11.4  %) prefer DoCX format; while 121(69.1 %) prefer PDF format.  These indicate that majority of the respondents prefer e-books  to printed books and the most preferred e-book format is PDF.

Question  4:  What  is  the  level  of  satisfaction  of  LIS  undergraduate students with the use of e-books? 
Table 5 reveals the level of satisfaction of LIS undergraduate  students based on their use of e-books. The result shows that  154(88.0 %) of the respondents were satisfed with using e-book  while 21(12.0 %) were not. The table above also reveals that  11(6.3 %) has no satisfaction using e-book, 16(9.1 %) has little  satisfaction using e-book; 102(58.3 %) are satisfed to some  extent while 46(26.3 %) are greatly satisfed. Due to their level  of satisfaction 153(87.4 %) agrees to recommend the use of  
e-book to other students. The highlight of the fnding indicates  that LIS undergraduate students are satisfed with using e-book  but to some extent and this have great infuence to their interest  of recommending e-book to other students of which 153(87.4  %)  of  the  175  respondents  agrees  to  recommend  e-book  to  others.

Table 6 reveals the results on the problems encountered  by LIS undergraduate students with the use of e-books. The  fnding  shows  that  93(53.1  %)  of  the  respondents  strongly  agreed that they encounter diffculties in accessing computers  or  internet  to  be  able  to  read  e-books,  31(17.7  %)  were  undecided  while  51(29.2  %)  strongly  disagreed.  A  total  of  92(52.6 %) of the respondents strongly agreed that the cost of  affording e-book reader is high and 29(16.6 %) were undecided  while 54(30.8 %) strongly disagreed. Furthermore, 49(28.0 %)  of the respondents strongly agreed that e-book is hard to read  and browse and 27(15.4 %) were undecided while 99(56.5 %)  strongly disagreed. In addition, 46(26.3 %) of the respondents  strongly  agreed  they  don’t  have  confdence  in  the  relevant  technology used and 45(25.7 %) were undecided and 84(48.0  %)  strongly  disagreed. Also,  47(26.9  %)  of  the  respondents  strongly  agreed  that  the  use  of  e-books  requires  operational  skills  that  they  don’t  have,  26(14.9  %)  were  undecided  and  102(58.3%)  strongly  disagreed.  A  total  of  78(44.6  %)  the  respondents strongly agreed that the use of e-books will not  be  effcient  if  the  screen  of  their  device  is  not  big  enough  while  29(16.6  %)  were  undecided  and  68(38.8  %)  strongly  disagreed. Furthermore, 63(36.0 %) of the respondents strongly  agreed that use of e-books requires a lot of mental effort while  34(19.4%) were undecided and 68(44.6 %) strongly disagreed.  Again, 54(30.8%) of the respondents strongly agreed that they  don’t fnd it easy searching, navigating and fipping through  the pages of e-books while 25(14.3 %) were undecided and  96(54.8  %)  strongly  disagreed.  From  the  fnding  using,  the  major problem encountered by the LIS undergraduate students  is the diffculties in reading e-books on computers or internet,  followed by the high cost e-book reader.

7.   dIS cUSSIoN   of  fINdINGS 
The  broad  objective  of  the  study  was  to  examine  the  perception  and  usage  pattern  of  e-book  among  LIS  undergraduates’ students in fve different academic institutions  in Nigeria. While the specifc objectives of the study were to  examine the perception of LIS undergraduate student’s towards  electronic  book;  to  determine  LIS  undergraduate  students’  preference  for  e-books;  to  determine  the  usage  patterns  of  e-books  among  LIS  undergraduate  students;  to  fnd  out  the  level of satisfaction of LIS undergraduate students with the use  of e-books and lastly to identify the major problems encounter  by LIS undergraduate students when using e-books.   
A  benchmark  which  is  the  total  grand  mean  (gM)  score 3.43 was used to fnd the perception of e-book by LIS  undergraduate students, comparing the grand mean score (gM)  with the mean score (MS) of each questions asked to ascertain  the respondents’ perception. The result reveals an overwhelming  majority of LIS undergraduate students’ perceived e-book as a  technology that enhances their learning effectiveness and easy  to use. They also perceived that the clear graphical illustrations  of e-book aid their learning and that the use of e-book helps  them to fnish their course content/outline quickly and enable  them to read faster. This corroborates the assertion that once  students can connect to the technology easily, they enjoy it and  even read faster48.  
on the preference for e-books, the result reveals that LIS  undergraduate students prefer e-books. There is no doubt that  e-book technology has its own problem of use, the problems  encountered when using e-book affect the level of satisfaction  and preference of using e-book. Studies related to this fnding  indicate  that  the  problem  of  diffculties  with  reading  from  screen,  navigation  issues,  and  problems  related  to  locating  materials and searching in general with e-books makes some  students  to  prefer  a  paper  copy  that  they  can  mark  up  with  a pencil or marker to e-book. Contrary to2, 3  , undergraduate  students were revealed to have the highest preference for print  books as a result of the diffculties they usually encounter such  as learning, retraining, and concentrating while in front of a  computer.  The  result  obtained  also  reveals  that  majority  of  the LIS undergraduate students’ prefer to use e-books in PDF  format. This is because of the fact that PDF is a fle format that  allow documents to be read regardless of hardware, operating  systems  or  applications  employed.  PDF  has  also  been

embraced  by  many  publishers  as  their  preferred  format  for  publishing their publication, and majority of the respondents  (LIS undergraduate students) uses e-book majorly for research  purpose, pointing to the fact that LIS undergraduate students  are always carrying out research and e-books in PDF format is  their major information source. This is because scholarly and  publishing professionals prefer e-books as a means of quick  dissemination  of  current  information  to  a  large  number  of  potential users37. 
 The result on the level of satisfaction of LIS undergraduate  students using e-book reveals that an overwhelming majority  were  satisfed  with  e-books  but  to  some  extent.  Therefore,  it  is  concluded  that  LIS  undergraduate  students  in  Nigeria  Institutions are satisfed with the use of e-books.  
The common problems encountered by LIS undergraduate  students when using e-books include diffculties in accessing  computers  or  internet,  cost  of  affording  e-books  reader  and  the problem of accessing and using e-books on a device with  small screen which usually make them to be ineffcient in its  use.  There  is  no  perfect  technology  anywhere  in  the  world.  Therefore, as far as e-book technology is concerned, there is  bound to be a problem. In a similar fnding by13,38  on factors  that discourage use of e-books, it was suggested that one major  factor is the cost of e-book reader. This notwithstanding, but a  confrmation that there is usually problem associated with the  use of e-books. 
8.   c oNcLUSIoNS 
This study examined the perception and usage pattern of  e-book among LIS undergraduate students. The fndings have  shown that LIS undergraduate students uses e-books more than  printed books. The result reveals that LIS undergraduate students  have  positive  perception  of  e-book  as  it  enhance  learning  effectiveness,  assist  to  fnish  course  content/outline;  makes  reading faster; easy to use and with clear graphical illustrations.  The usage pattern of e-book among LIS undergraduate students  is  majorly  for  research  purposes  and  the  majority  is  highly  satisfed with reading e-books. The major problem encountered  by the students with e-books is the diffculty of reading on the  computers or internet followed by the cost of e-books reader. It is  hereby concluded that librarians need to take into consideration,  users’ preferences when selecting and aquiring books, either in  electronic or printed format.

10.   r ecoMMeNdAtIoNS 
Based  on  the  fndings  of  the  study,  the  following  recommendations are made. These include the fact that courses  that  are  capable  of  boosting  and  encouraging  the  usage  of  e-books for complementary reading should be included in the  LIS curriculum. This will increase the interest of the sttudents  in  using  e-books  to  complement  learning  and  not  research  alone.  LIS  undergraduate  students  should  be  provided  with  ready made access to computers and internet at anytime. This  will facilitate quick access to e-books. The visibility of e-books  is  very  important,  therefore  libraries  are  recommended  to  subscribe to various e-books databases so that the students can  have access to them directly in the library. Also, the university  authority  and  library  of  the  particpating  institutions  should  make e-books readers available in large quantity. Doing so is  assumed will increase the use of e-books and further arouse the  interest of the students .
