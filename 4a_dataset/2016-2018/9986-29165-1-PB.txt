ABSTRACT 
The whole essence of the library lies is providing the information to users they require at the right time, using a  fast and easy way. For Covenant University, the migration from Alice for Windows to Millennium software in 2010  brought about a complete change in the library workplace. This paper brings to the fore all the efforts and processes  that was engaged to bring on board Millennium software for library operations in Center for Learning Resources. It  also looks at the hitches encountered during the process and how these hitches were tackled. Suggestions are also  given on how to successfully automate library resources and migrate from one software to another.

1. InTRodUCTIon  
Information  and  communication  technology  has  tremendously  changed  the  way  and  manner  in  which  activities  are  being  carried  out  in  libraries.  In  recent  times,  computers  and  other  peripherals  have  been  put  to  use  to  make  work  easier  for  library  staff  and  to  make  information  readily  available  to  users. Traditional  libraries  have  changed  tremendously  to  digital  libraries  and this has become the norm in many countries all over  the  globe.  Many  libraries  are  digitizing  their  resources  and to this end, Carr1   posits  libraries  are  assuming  new  roles,  imagining  new  possibilities,  and  developing  new  solutions. It can therefore be said that the use of ICT in  libraries  have  brought  to  fore  Raganathan’s  law  which  says “every book its reader and every reader his book, do  not waste the time of users and the library is a growing  organism. Adogbeji,2 et al  asserted that the usefulness of  information  is  a  function  of  its  timelessness,  therefore  getting the right information at the right time and in the  right format depends on the facilities in use by libraries  and  its  processing,  storage  and  dissemination.  They  observed  that  at  present,  library  operations  in  Nigeria  are  still  largely  manual  with  all  the  attendant  delays.  They  mentioned  that  users’  frustration  in  having  access  to  pieces  of  information  is  increasing  everyday  due  to  unsatisfactory  service  of  libraries.  They  also  noted  that  so  many  automated  libraries  in  Nigeria  are  either  not  using  library  software  they  have  purchased  or  in  the  threshold  of  changing  to  another  within  a  short  time  of  committing  fund  to  the  project.

1.1 History  of  the  Center  for  Learning  Resources 
The  library  in  Covenant  University  is  known  as  ‘Centre  for  Learning  Resources’  (CLR).  It  started  with  the inception of the university in 2002 at the then College  of  Business  Studies  ground  floor,  before  the  library  was  moved  in  2004  to  the  main  building.  Presently,  the  library  has  grown  in  its  collection  and  with  the  number  of  staff  employed.  The  total  floor  area  of  the  complex  is  11,300 
/2 
m 
  with  a  seating  capacity  of  3500  persons.  It  is  designed  as  an  imposing  glass  structure,  and  is  strategically located in a central place amidst the college  buildings,  the  University  Chapel  and  the  students’  halls  of  residence.  
All  routine  activities  of  the  library,  Centre  for  Learning Resources (CLR), http://covenantuniversity.edu. ng/Library  has  been  fully  computerised  and  can  boast  of  a  functional  virtual  library  service,  which  gives  staff  and students access to the Web Public Access Catalogue  (WEBPAC), and other e-resources from offices, departments  and wherever there is a computer terminal that is linked  to  the  university  network  and  internet. 
2. LITERAUTURE  REVIEW 
For  Nigerian  libraries  to  improve  their  choice  of  software  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  failed  library  automation  there  is  need  for  systems  analysis  to  be  done. According to Nok4  automation is the automatic, as  opposed  to  human,  operation  of  process,  equipment,  or  system, or the techniques and equipment used to achieve  

========1========

this.  Adogbeji2,  et  al  noted  that  a  system  analysis  of  what  software  is  needed  and  the  vision/objective  of  the  library  should  be  strictly  adhered  to  before  choosing  a  library software, they also suggested that systems should  be  frequently  updated  for  proper  library  maintenance.  Adomi5   also  noted  some  constraints,  however,  inhibits  the success of the process to automation, these includes  funding,  scarcity  of  systems  analysts,  and  absence  of  dedicated  commitment  to  automation  on  the  part  of  the  management. She stressed that the attitude of management  to  automation  and  maintenance  culture  is  poor.  
Matoria & Upadhyay3 also observed that the existing  library data is an important data and cannot be generated  again  and  again  as  it  is  costly  in  terms  of  resources  such  as  money,  manpower,  and  time.  When  automating  a library, it is imperative to re-use the existing data with  the  new  library  management  software  by  converting  it  in a way that it would be suitable for the new software.  More so, the switch over from one software to another is  also  useful  for  libraries  as  the  existing  data  are  refined  and  cleaned  during  the  conversion  process. 
Mohammed6  posited that automation enhances proper  management of large collections and the changing nature  of  library  users.  He  further  stated  that  the  inadequacy  of  traditional  library  services  and  tools  in  coping  with  the  requirements  of  identifying  information  pertinent  to  a  given  problem  has  forced  libraries  to  automate  their  functional  service  areas.  Abubakar7 opined  that  automation  in  libraries  brings  about  the  decentralized  access to records and information. These new technologies  according  to  Adomi5   allows  libraries  to  provide  better  services to users by offering simple access to what they  want, when and how they want it. Ifidon8   identified  the  following  as  major  reasons  why  every  library  should  embrace  automation: 
•	 It  enhances  libraries  reputation 
•	 It  helps  the  library  manager  in  providing  report  on  
the  various  operations  of  the  library. 
•	 It  helps  in  completing  a  task  easily  and  accurately •	 It  facilitates  the  collection  data  which  can  assist  
librarians  in  the  management  of  library  collections •	 It  provides  a  means  of  offering  new  improved

services to patrons and facilitates cooperation between  
libraries. 
•	 It  helps  in  reducing  staff  cost.  
Staff  training  is  extremely  important  and  should  be  carried  out  for  all  the  library  staff  who  will  in  turn  train  the  library  users  internally.  The  training  has  to  continue  for  a  period,  so  that  the  new  software  is  well  utilized  and  mastered. 
This paper is written as an evidence of the successful  migration  of  software  by  Centre  for  Learning  Resource  Covenant University Library. The change from Alice for  Windows (AFW) to Millennium Integrated Software, owned  by Innovative brought about increase in the accessibility  of  the  library  resources.  The  resources  available  at  the  CLR,  Covenant  University,  have  not  only  become  more  accessible  to  users  within  the  physical  terrain  of  the  university  but  also  to  any  library  clientele  who  has  access  to  internet  facility.  
3. InTERfACE   of  So ME   Mod ULES   In  
MILLEnnIUM   In TEgRATEd  SofTWARE 
Millennium  integrated  software  is  proprietary  software,  the  Management  of  the  library  carried  out  proper  preliminary  system  analysis  overtime  before  embarking  on  its  purchase.  Each  module  in  Millennium  has  a  friendly  user  interface  which  makes  it  easy  to  handle.  Some  of  the  modules  currently  in  use  at  Centre  for  Learning  Resources  are: 
3.1 WEBoPAC 
Cataloguing  details  of  each  information  resource  is  entered into the Millennium software using the appropriate  module  and  this  is  made  available  to  users  via  the  WEBPAC.  The  WEBPAC  is  accessible  worldwide  as  far  as  there  is  internet  connection  and  a  peripheral  to  make  the  internet  accessible. The WEBPAC  has  several  entry/access  points  such  as  author,  subject,  keyword,  title,  etc.  (Fig.  1). 
3.2 Cataloguing  Module 
The cataloguing module consists of two main sections;  one is located by the left hand side while the other is at  the top of the module. The section on the left hand side  
229 

========2========

DJLIT, VOL.  36,  NO.  4, JULY   2016 
consists of nine items. The cataloguing module makes it  possible to import complete cataloguing details of books  from  remote  databases.  This  is  achievable  because  the  remote search helps to get across to several Z39.50 and  MARC 21 compliant records of other libraries across the  world.  The  imported  item  is  edited  before  it  is  saved  into  the  library  catalogue  (Fig.  2). 
3.3  Circulation  Module 
The  circulation  module  of  Millennium  is  very  easy  to operate and it performs all the functions of circulation  activities  such  as  check  in,  check  out,  items  on  hold,  statistics amongst others. Using this module for circulation  activities makes it very fast, as it works with technological  equipment  such  as  scanners  and  barcode  labels.  It  is  also  from  this  module  that  overdue  notices  are  sent,  fines  are  processed,  payments  of  fines  and  issuance  of  receipts  are  made. 
Each patron has a personalised window where records  of  circulation  activities  are  saved.  In  this  window,  their  respective  details  and  how  such  details  could  be  saved,  edited,  viewed  or  deleted  is  available.  There  is  also  a  provision  where  individual  patron  photograph  can  be  displayed  on  the  window  (Fig.  3).

3.4  Serials  Module 
Millennium’s  serial  module  helps  to  capture  the  details of serial publications such as journals, newspapers,  and  magazines.  These  details  are  saved  into  the  library  catalogue.  It  consists  of  items  to  be  indexed  on  the  left  hand  side  of  the  module  these  includes;  author,  title,  subject,  keyword,  etc. When  a  subject  or  keyword  is  entered  into  the  WEBPAC,  if  it  has  been  indexed,  a  user  can  locate  it  easily  through  these  search  terms  (Fig.  4). 
4. LIMITATIonS   of  M ILLEnnIUM   Sof TWARE 
Millennium  is  very  good  software,  but  it  still  has  its  limitations. These  limitations  are: 
•	 Cost: 	 It 	 is 	 expensive, 	 and 	 there 	 are 	 maintenance 	 
charges,  which  are  also  quite  costly. 
•	 Administrator: 	 The 	 owners 	 of 	 Millennium 	 are 	 the 	 
sole  administrators  and  they  alone  have  access  to  
the  administration  and  backup  of  the  system.  •	 User’s 	 limitation: 	 Innovative 	 sells 	 Millennium 	 packages

That  is,  it  is  only  ten  people  that  can  log  on  the  
millennium  module  at  the  same  time.  These  are

and serial units for indexing of serial materials (such  
as newspapers, magazines and journals) daily. In the

•	 Bandwidth: 	 The 	 bandwidth 	 required 	 for 	 Millennium 	 
to  operate  is  fairly  large.  This  is  because  it  relies  
solely  on  internet  network  to  function.

server happens in the second. In a way if one server  
fails  the  other  one  captures  the  work  done  so  far,  
therefore  preventing  total  loss  of  information.  It  is

Following processes are involved in migrating from  Alice  for  windows  to  Millennium  integrated  software,  in  Covenant  University  library: 
(a) Study  of  the  existing  system/data  design (b) Export  of  existing  data 
(c) Reformatting  of  the  text  file 
(d) Mapping  with  destination  database 
(e) Data  modification  and  rationalization 
(f) Server  and  Red  Hat  Linux  system 
(g) Testing  and  configuration  of  data 
(a) Study  of  the  existing  system/data  design 
A  system  analysis  had  to  be  carried  out  by  the  management  of  the  library  to  determine  whether  the  current  system  was  meeting  the  demands  of  the  users.  An  analysis  was  done  to  justify  the  functionality  of  
232 
In  case  of  migrating  domain,  databases  mapping  is  important. It was mapped by first connecting to the database  to  be  mapped,  then  MySQL  actions  was  updated,  and  the table with which the databases was created and used  was  selected.  After  selecting  the  tables  for  the  project,  it was linked to the tables in the destination database. It  automatically  linked  source  tables  to  destination  tables  based on their names. The migration was mapped by the  IT  Engineer  who  re-mapped/fine-tuned  the  mappings  in  the  last  step  of  the  new  project.  
(e)  Data  Modification  and  Rationalisation 
The  backup  system  was  also  put  in  place,  and  that  included: the tape drive and the cloud backup. In the tape  drive,  a  tape  is  fixed  to  the  server  and  while  the  data  are  recorded  they  are  stored  directly  in  the  tape,  when  it  is  filled,  it  is  removed  and  another  tape  is  installed. 
The  cloud  back  up:  involves  the  API  backing  up  itself  from  the  server  at  innovative  which  is  also  being  done  from  USA.  A  tape  drive  was  integrated  into  the  Millennium  software  which  would  facilitate  the  process

of  back  up.  Centre  for  Leaning  Resources,  first  started  with the tape drive, and then later used the cloud backup.  The  millennium  server  has  two  hard  discs,  when  a  disc  is full, it is labeled and kept for backup. Only the latest  backup  is  restored  from  the  disc. 
(f) Server  and  Red  Hat  Linux  System 
For  installation  of  the  data,  Millennium  operators  demanded  that  a  special  server  called  rate  server  which  houses two hard disks of 300 and 200 gigabyte respectively  be installed. Since Millennium software does not operate  on windows, it was mandatory to get a Red hat 5 Linux  before  the  software  could  be  installed.  Red  hat  Linux  has  security  vessels  embedded  in  it  therefore  making  it  difficult for any virus to attack the Millennium software.  Millennium has a SSL (Secure Socket Layer) which secures  information that is being sent in and out of the software.  All operational data were recovered and being used. An  inverter with 5 KVA that can hold power up to 6-8 hours  was  also  installed  in  case  of  power  fluctuation. (g) Testing  of  Data 
After the successful transfer of data from adhoc table  to  SQL  server  tables  with  a  Red  hat  linux  system,  the  data  was  tested  to  check  out  if  the  migration  process  was  auspiciously  carried  out  and  no  data  was  missing,  then it was configured for use. The systems librarian, IT  Engineer and Director of the Centre for learning resources  were  all  involved  in  the  process  and  they  confirmed  all  data  were  intact.  After  the  successful  migration  of  Millennium,  the  administrators  of  innovative  sent  an  IT  engineer/librarian  who  demonstrated  the  operations  on  the  Millennium  interface.  It  was  important  to  get  everyone involved to make sure that important functions  or  needed  capabilities  were  not  overlooked.

Availability of funds: The proprietor base of Covenant  University believes in excellence and they are always  ready to make funds available on worthwhile projects.  This created a nucleus for the successful deployment  of  Millennium  software.  It  was  therefore  necessary  for  the  library  to  employ  the  use  of  state  of  the  art  resources  that  will  enhance  cutting  edge  and  best  practices.  
Availability of competent staff: The migration process  was  successful  because  Covenant  University  has  competent  and  well-seasoned  ICT  professionals  and  librarians. 
Reliable and constant power supply: There is constant  supply  of  electricity.  
8. ConCLUSIonS 
Millennium integrated software is user friendly and  makes  the  task  of  librarians  easy,  especially  because  of  its  ability  to  import  catalogue  details  from  various  databases of other libraries across the globe. This allows  
for  library  users  across  the  globe  to  have  access  to  resources  contained  in  the  library  once  there  is  internet  access.  Libraries  that  are  yet  to  be  automated  should  consider  using  Millennium  for  their  day  to  day  library  operations,  not  just  because  it  is  a  big  drift  from  the  manual means of organising library resources but because  it is a web-based library software. With Millennium, all  types  of  libraries  can  feel  relaxed  from  maintenance  of  hardware and software and concentrate on enhancing their  library  services  to  the  satisfaction  of  their  users.
