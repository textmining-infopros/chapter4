The present study is based on 9053 citations appended to 92 doctoral theses submitted to the Department of  Economics, Punjabi University, Patiala, during 2000-2014. The main objective of the study is to investigate authorship  pattern of the citations, format of literature cited, electronic/print form of citations, chronological distribution of  citations, geographical distribution of book and core journal citations. A ranked list of journals in economics is also  compiled in order to fnd out the most referred journal. It is found that journals are the most consulted resources  with 49.39 per cent citations in the feld of economics. Bradford’s law of scattering is applicable to the present  
study with Bradford multiplier as 11.327. 
Keywords: Citation analysis; Core journals; Bradford law of scattering; Economics 
1. INTrODUCTION 
An  essential  part  of  any  research  article  is  the  list  of  references which point to the prior publications. A manuscript  cannot be written in vacuum; a long list of references is used  in  its  preparation.  Usually  citations  and  references  are  used  interchangeably. But Smith has made a distinction “A reference  is  the  acknowledgment  that  one  document  gives  to  another;  a citation is the acknowledgment that one document receives  from another”. A citation implies a relationship between the  cited  and  citing  document  (s).  The  study  of  these  types  of  relationship is called citation analysis1. 
Citation counts measure the impact of scientifc activity2.  It is used to study the characteristics of recorded knowledge3.  It is also one of the popular methods to identify core references  in a particular subject. One can evaluate and interpret citations  received  by  articles,  authors,  institutions,  etc.  which  help  to  identify the quality of the information sources4. 
Citation analysis is a way to understand the users what  type  of  documents  are  used  by  the  researchers  and  faculty  members  in  writing  their  theses,  research  articles,  project  reports etc.5. The present study focuses on the citation analysis  of theses submitted to the Department of Economics, Punjabi  University, Patiala during the period 2000-2014. It will help  to fnd out the use pattern of documents by the researchers of  economics.

period 2005-2006. It was found that maximum citations were  used from journals and average citations per article came out  to  be  63.15.  Authors  preferred  single  authorship  in  books  whereas in journals they preferred joint authorship. Strategic  Management  Journal,  Academy  of  Management  and  Administrative Science Quarterly  were the three most cited  journals among the authors of this journal. The core journals  identifed were mainly from USA and UK 
Sudhier7  tested the Bradford law on the journal citations of  79 doctoral theses in physics submitted to the Indian Institute  of Science, Bengaluru for the period 2004-08. Out of the total  11,319  reference,  690  were  periodical  references.  Physical  Review-B  with 9.53 per cent citation, followed by  Physical  Review-A   with  7.69  per  cent  citation  and  Astrophysical  Journal  with 5.47 per cent citation, were the most preferred  journals  by  the  scholars.  Leimkuhler  model  was  employed  for verifcation of Bradford law, the law was found valid for  the journal distribution with value of k as 12.6. 
Trayambakrao  and  Sonwane8 examined  2876  citation  contained  in  34  PhD  theses  in  economics  submitted  to  Dr  Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University Library. Books  were the most preferred form of citations with 57.86 per cent  of  citation.  Single  authorship  was  dominant  over  multiple  authors as 72.81 per cent of the citation were single authored.  The use of web citations was 0.9 per cent only. 
Singh  and  Bebi9   highlighted  the  authorship  pattern,  forms of literature cited, country-wise scattering of citations,  distribution of Indian and foreign citations of 25 PhD theses  in  sociology  submitted  to  the  University  of  Delhi  during  1995-2010. There were 5766 citation appended to 25 theses.  A  ranked  list  of  journals  identifed  30  core  journal  which  disclosed  that  Economic  &  Political  Weekly   was  the  most

(137  time)  cited  journal.  Maximum  citations  were  book  citations  with  67.2  per  cent  citation  and  about  45  per  cent  citation were from India. 83.94 per cent of the citation were  single authored. 
Amritpal  and  Rattan10  analysed  17  doctoral  theses  in  library  and  information  science  submitted  to  Punjabi  University,  Patiala  till  2013.  the  fndings  of  the  research  revealed  that  journal  citations  were  the  maximum  (48.43  per  cent)  and  authors  preferred  to  work  in  isolation  as 59.41 per cent reference were single authored. More than  49 per cent of the book citations were of Indian origin. Journal  citations  were  more  recent  than  book  citations. College  and  Research Libraries was the most referred journal by the LIS  researchers and the data of journal distribution ftted well with  Bradford distribution. 
Mahajan and Kumar11 examined 36 PhD theses of history  submitted to Panjab University, Chandigarh, during the period  2000-2012.  It  was  revealed  that  there  were  8488  citation  contained  in  36  theses.  Books  were  the  most  cited  form  of  citation with 54.16 per cent of citation. The use of electronic  resources  was  1.6  per  cent  only.  There  was  dominance  of  single authorship over multiple authors. The journal Economic  & Political Weekly  was ranked one among the researchers of  history. Half-life period of book and journal citations was 35  and  21  year,  respectively.  More  than  58  per  cent  books  and  64.47 per cent journal were of Indian origin. Bradford law of  scattering ftted well to this study.

4. HYPOTHESES 
The following hypotheses have been formulated for the  present study: 
• Books and journals are the major source of information  
in economics literature 
•   t he share of electronic resources is very less but in the  
changing environment the trend of using these resources  
is increasing 
•   t he half-life period of book citations is more than  
journal citations 
•   r esearchers prefer foreign books as compared to Indian  
books. 
5.   r ESEArCH  METHODOLOGY 
The  data  is  collected  from  92  theses  in  economics  submitted  to  Punjabi  University,  Patiala  during  the  period  2000-2014.  There  are  9053  reference  used  in  these  theses.  Each reference of each thesis is analysed manually to fnd out  format of the citations, authorship pattern, year, geographical  distribution  of  book  citations  along  with  core  journals  and  electronic/print  form  of  citations.  The  references  are  also  checked for duplicate references as these are excluded from  the study. The resultant data is recorded into MS-Excel spread  sheets.  The  recorded  data  is  tabulated  and  presented  in  the  form of tables as per the objectives of the study i.e. authorship  pattern,  form  of  citations,  geographical  distribution  of  book  citations and so on. A ranked list of journals is also prepared  to fnd out the core journals. the place of publication of the  journal is found from online as well as off line resources of  Bhai Kahn Singh nabha Library, Punjabi University, Patiala.  The  half-life  period  of  documents  is  calculated  using  Sen12 formula. 
6. ANALYSIS AND  DISCUSSION 
There are a total of 92 theses submitted to the Department  of Economics, Punjabi University, Patiala during 2000-2014.  The total number of citations are 9053 and the average number  of citations per thesis is 98.4. 
6.1 Year-wise  Distribution  of Theses 
Table 1 shows year-wise submission of the PhD theses in  the Department of Economics during 2000-2014. The highest  number of theses, i.e. 15 are submitted in the year 2013 whereas  the  least  number  of  theses,  i.e.  1  is  submitted  in  2005. The  average citations per thesis has improved from 75.33 to 89.62.  The maximum average citations is 167.3 and minimum 62.5  in the years 2009 and 2002 respectively. The overall average  citations per thesis has come out to be 98.4.  
6.2 Form  of  Cited  Documents 
Table 2 reveals the format of 9053 citation cited in the  PhD theses of economics during 15 year. Journals comprise  the  highest  citations  (49.39  per  cent)  followed  by  book  citations  (14.44  per  cent);  chapters  from  a  book  (13.85  per  cent); web-sites (5.14 per cent); govt. publications (4.55 per  cent); working papers (3.35 per cent) and so on as indicated  in table 2. Looking at the 5 group of period (each 3 year) the  use of journals is almost the same showing a decline of very  less percentage. The use of books has also declined from 22.39  per  cent  to  17.7  per  cent.  Similarly,  the  use  of  Government  publications and others has also decreased. The use of book  chapters has shown an upward trend from 6.26 per cent to 21.9  per cent and then downward to 6.73 per cent. The use of web  resources is continuously increasing from 0 per cent to 8.07 per  cent. Similarly, the use of working papers has increased from 0  per cent to 4.05 per cent. 
6.3 Authorship  Pattern

Table 3 which indicates that the researchers of economics prefer  single authored documents for writing their theses as more than  63 per cent of the cited documents are single authored followed  by two authors with 25.44 per cent citation, three authors with  7.87 per cent and more than three authors with 3.58 per cent.  year-wise  distribution  of  authorship  pattern  indicates  that  the  use  of  single  authored  documents  has  decreased  from  81.65  per  cent  to  42.07  over  the  period  of  ffteen  year  with  slight fuctuations. It shows contrasting results to the overall  authorship pattern of the economics documents. 
6.4 Electronic resources  
To show the use of electronic resources over a period of  ffteen years, the whole period is divided into three groups in  table 4. Each group is of fve years. It is evident from this table  that the use of electronic resources keeps on increasing from  one group of period to another starting from 0.25 per cent in

6.5 Chronological  Distribution  of  Citations 
Table 5 indicates that the highest number i.e. about 1/3rd  of citations belong to publications published during 1995-2004  followed by 2046 citation (22.6 per cent) during 2005-2014,  1687 citation (18.63 per cent) during 1985-1994, 1073 citation  (11.85 per cent) during 1975-1984 and 643 citation (7.1 per  cent)  during  1965-1974.  The  percentage  of  citations  which  belong to  the period  before  1905  is  very  small i.e. 0.16  per  cent which indicates that the researchers of economics prefer  current  literature  in  contrast  to  archival  literature.  Date  of  origin of 2.01 per cent citations is not given.

6.6 Half-life  or  Obsolescence  of  Literature 
As  per  Sen  (1999)  the  half-life  period  will  be  integral  number consisting of whole years plus a fraction of a year. e.g.  3.25. It can be represented as 
T= Y + y                                                                        (1) 
Here Y  is the number of whole years and  y  is the fraction  of a year which can be calculated by the formula 
(a-b)/(c-b)                                                                      (2) 
Here, a  is the 50 per cent of the references,  b  is the 50 per  cent of the cumulative number of references of the subcritical  year  and  c   is  the  cumulative  number  of  references  of  the  critical year. Critical year is the year in which 50 per cent of the  citations are reached counted from the base year. Subcritical  year is the year previous to critical year.  
Putting the value of y  in Eqn.  (1), we get the formula for  half-life period. 
T= Y + (a-b)/(c-b) 
The half-life period has been calculated based on Table 6.  From the data of this table, the value of Y  = 17;  a  = 9053/2 =  4526.5 (say 4527);  b  = 4365 and c = 4639. The half-life period  of  economics  citations  has  been  calculated  as  17.59  year.  Similarly, the half-life period of books and journals has been  calculated  which  is  21.74  and  18.72  year,  respectively. This  table also discloses that 10.7 per cent of the citations are 7 year,  old. More than 26 per cent of the citations are 11 year, old and  53.7 per cent of the literature is 19 years old.  
6.7 Geographical  Distribution  of book  Citations  in  
Economics

Economic Review  (1.66 per cent) and  The Economic Journal  and  Indian Economic Review  each (1.16 per cent). First two  journals cover more than 26 per cent of the journal citations;  fve  journals  cover  about  1/3rd  of  the  journal  citations.  About 1/3rd of the journal citations are covered by 5 journal.  therefore, these journals are identifed as core journals. three  journals out of the 5 core journal are from India, one (each) is  from USA and UK.        
                           
6.9 Application  of bradford  Law  of  Scattering  to  
Journal  Distribution 
for  application  of  Bradford’s  law,  the  citations  were  divided into three zones (p=3) and the value of k  i.e. Bradford  multiplier has been calculated using the following mathematical  formula, 
k = (eyym)1/p 
                                                                                    
(3) 
k = (1.781ym)1/p 
In  the  present  data  distribution  ym i.e.  the  number  of  citations of the most productive item = 816. From Eqn. (3) the  value of k  is 11.327 
And r0 =  the number of journals in the nucleus of Bradford  is calculated as 
r0 = T (k-1)/ (kp-1)                                                           (4) here, T  = Total number of journals 
r0 = 7.196 
r1 = 81.509 
r0 = 923.252 
the Bradford distribution can be written as 7.196: 7.196  (11.327): 7.196 (11.327)2. 
the  fndings  of  this  calculation  are  shown  in table  9.  Table 9 indicates that the number of journals in the nucleus  is 7 with 1587 journal citations. Zone 1 contains 82 journals  with 1374 article citations and zone 2 contains 1510 journal  citations. the  exact  number  of  Bradford  multiplier  for  each  group is calculated by dividing the number of journals in the  given group by its preceding group. The value of k  for the two  groups is 11.714 and 11.256 which is very close to Bradford  multiplier  11.327  calculated  from  the  formula  devised  by  Egghe13-14. This shows that the journal distribution in the theses  submitted to the Department of Economics, Punjabi University  Patiala, is as per Bradford distribution. 
7. TESTING  OF  HYPOTHESES 
All the four hypotheses are put to test and the following  conclusions are drawn. 
•   h ypotheses 1 says that books and journals are the major  
source  of  information  in  economics  literature.  In  the  
present study, books and journals together form 63.82 per  
cent of the total citations which validates hypothesis 1. •   h ypothesis 2 says that the share of electronic resources  
is very less but in the changing environment, the trend of  
using these resources is increasing. The use of electronic  
resources increases from 0.25 per cent in 2000-2004 to  
6.88  per  cent  in  2010-2014  indicating  that  the  trend  of  
using electronic resources is increasing. It authenticates  
hypothesis 2. 
•   h ypothesis 3 says that the half-life period of book citations  
is more than journal citations. The half-life period of books  
is 21.74 years whereas it is 18.72 years for journals which  
clearly reveals that half-life of book citations is more than  
journals proving hypothesis 3 to be true. 
•   h ypothesis  4  says  that  the  researchers  prefer  foreign  
books  as  compared  to  Indian  books. The  use  of  Indian  
books is 43.15 per cent and rest of the books are of foreign  
origin showing preference for foreign books. this verifes  
hypothesis 4. 
8. FINDINGS AND  CONCLUSIONS 
The  study  analysed  92  theses  in  economics  submitted  to the Department of Economics, Punjabi University, Patiala  during the period 2000-2014. The average citations per thesis  is 98.4 which indicates that the economics researchers are not  referring much of the available literature. It is disclosed that  the journals are the most cited sources with 49.39 per cent of  the citations. The year-wise distribution of authorship pattern  indicates  that  the  trend  is  changing  from  single  authored  documents  to  multiple  authored  documents. As  50  per  cent  of  the  literature  cited  is  17.59  year  old  which  indicates  the  preference  of  researchers  for  current  literature.  The  half- life  period  of  books  and  journals  is  21.74  and  18.72  year,  respectively which shows that the half-life period of books is  more than journals. the journal distribution is as per Bradford  law  of  scattering  and  identifes  7  core  journal.  journals  increase from one zone to another with multiplier 11.327. The  trend  of  using  electronic  resources  is  increasing. The  actual  use  of  electronic  documents  is  much  higher  than  revealed  from  citations.  Students  do  not  know  how  to  cite  electronic  documents. They  have  also  not  followed  uniform  pattern  of  citations.  Therefore,  training  should  be  given  to  students  about citing of electronic documents as well as using uniform  referencing pattern of documents. 
Further this type of study is useful in identifying the core  journals which are used by the researchers in economics. The  study considers only economics theses, further research should  be conducted in other subjects as well as comparison among  other subjects of social sciences and sciences.
