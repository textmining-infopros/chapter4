ABSTRACT 
The  present study aims to bring out the contribution of women faculty in the discipline of Physics in select  institutions of Delhi. The study covers a total of 44 women faculties and their 802 publications during the period  of 2011-2015 collected from various sources. The study presents a scientometrics analysis of 463 journal articles.  The study focuses on authorship pattern, research interest areas, most productive authors, most used journals etc.  The study indicates that multi-authored papers were dominated. Ratnamala Chatterjee from IIT Delhi found to be  the most productive author and Journal of Applied Physics is the most preferred journal. CSIR-National Physical  Laboratory was leading institution in publishing journal articles (145). It was noticed that majority of women authors  preferred to be the second author while writing the paper jointly. 
Keywords: Scientometrics; Women faculties; Physics; Collaborative Coeffcient   
1.  INTRODUCTION 
Women  are  an  important  section  of  the  academic  workforce,  more  particularly  in  the  science  and  technology  domain.  Department  of  Science  and  Technology    (DST)  Govt. of India launched ‘Women Scientists Scheme (WOS)’  during 2002-2003. This initiative primarily aimed at providing  opportunities to women scientists and technologists. In 2014,  DST  has  restructured  all  the  women  specifc  programmes  under  one  umbrella  known  as  knowledge  involvement  in  research advancement through nurturing (KIRAN). KIRAN is  addressing various issues related with women scientists (e.g.  unemployment, relocation) and aimed to provide opportunities  in research (WOS-A), technology development/demonstration  (WOS-B), and self-employment (WOS-C), etc1.  
The study is an attempt to analyse the trends and growth  of research publications among the women faculties/scientists  in  select  institutions  of  Delhi  and  to  shed  light  on  their  contributions. It was found during the study that the number of  women faculties is less in comparison to male faculties. 
2.  LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Several  bibliometric  and  scientometrics  studies  have  been done in the past all over the world in every discipline.  In India several studies have been conducted in scientometrics  on faculties and scientist’s research outputs. Garg and Kumar2 have conducted a study on women scientists in life sciences  in  India  during  2008-2009.  They  analysed  9,957  papers  published  by  Indian  scientists  and  did  a  comparative  study  of  contributions  of  male  and  female  scientists.  They  found

Accepted : 17 August 2017, Online published : 07 November 2017 
410 
that  only  340  articles  were  contributed  by  female  scientists  exclusively  and  4,671  were  jointly  by  male  and  female  scientists. The study supports that female contribution is less  as compare to male scientists. Another study was conducted  by Radhakrishnan and Velmurugun3  on the contributions made  by faculty members of Periyar University, India, during 1998- 2014.  The  study  focused  on  publishing  trends,  authorship  pattern, their TLCS, TLCR and so on. Also, a study by Hasan4,  et al.  found no signifcant difference in the contributions made  by the male and female research scholars of CSIR. Sotudeh and  Khoshian5  studied performance of male and female scientists  in terms of their output and impact in the discipline of nano  science and technology and found that women perform equally  well as their men counter parts in terms of output and impact.  Gupta6, et  al.   in  their  study  analyses  India’s  performance  in  science  and  technology  (S&T),  using  publications  data  and  different quantitative and qualitative measures. Its focuses on  India’s global publication share, growth rate, citation quality,  international  collaborative  publications  share,  its  publication  share and distribute on in various broad and narrow subjects  using 15 years data from the Scopus. The study suggests the  need  to  increase  the  pace  of  Indian  scientifc  research  and  also improve its quality compared with other developed and  developing countries.  
Senthil kumar and Ulaganathan7 analysed the Astrophysics  research output in India from the year 1989-2014. The fndings  of the study revealed that the highest number of publications is  in 2013 with 913 records having a global citation score 4342  and  local  citation  score  of  324.The  study  shows  that  major  source  of  publication  in Astrophysics  research  comes  in  the  form  of  articles.  Nagarkar8,  et  al.   conducted  a  research  on

the papers published by faculty of life sciences by Savitribai  Phule  Pune  University,  India  during  1999-2013.  The  study  found  that  the  research  productivity  of  faculty  members  is  increasing,  their  publications  are  getting  good  citations  and  thereby their journals have better impact factor. Jeyamala and  Balasubramainan9   conducted  a  research  on  nuclear  physics  during  1999-2013  globally.  They  found  that  collaborative  author’s contribution is very high in Nuclear Physics.  
3.  OBJECTIVES      
(i) To identify the faculties by gender and different forms of  
publications by women authors; 
(ii) To  make  year-wise  distribution  of  journal  articles  and  
conference papers and to identify the authorship pattern; (iii) To know the main research interest areas/specialisations  
of authors and preferred position of women authors in the  
sequence of authors in papers written jointly with male  
scientists; 
(iv) To identify the most productive women authors and their  
highly cited research papers; 
(v) To  know  the  year-wise  break-up  of  journal  articles  in  
Indian and foreign journals, to identify the country-wise  
distribution of journal articles and distribution of journals  
by country of origin; 
(vi) To make a rank list of most preferred journals. 
4.  METHODOLOGY 
The  data  collected  from  individual  scientists/faculties  working in the concerned institutions for fve years from 2011  to 2015. It included the curriculum vitae (CV) of the women  faculties  downloaded  from  the  institute  websites  and  some  faculties  have  sent  their  CVs  to  the  corresponding  author  by mail. Other sources that were made use included Web of  Science, Research Gate, Google Scholar and Annual Reports  of the institutes. The most diffcult task of any bibliometric/ scientometrics study is to identify the gender/sex of the authors  in papers authored, as bibliographic databases do not provide  the gender/sex information of the authors. To overcome this  problem, authors prepared the profles and faculty list of the  Physics departments and then separated the male and female  faculties/scientists  to  see  the  strength  of  women  faculty  in  each department. The authors have prepared a list of women  faculties/scientists for each department included in the study.  The authors have tried to collect all the journal and conference  publications  published  during  2011-2015.  For  that  purpose  
Table 1. List of Institutions of faculty by gender 
Name of University/Institute CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (NPL) 
different sources have been used for data collection because  all publications have not been covered by any single source.  It includes journal articles, conference papers, books, chapters  in book, monographs, invited talks/lectures, patents, research  projects and research guidance. All the bibliographic details of  publications were flled in Excel sheets and analysed as per the  requirements of the study. 
5.  RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
5.1 Distribution  of  Faculty  by  Gender 
Table 1 presents the list of seven institutions which were  included in the study along with their staff strength in terms of  male and female faculties. It clearly indicates that out of 300  faculty only 44 (14.7%) are women faculties/scientists. Data  presented in Table 1 indicates that number of women faculty  varied between 2 and 15. Highest number of women strength  was found in CSIR-National Physical Laboratory and lowest in  Jamia millia Islamia. 
5.2 Distribution  of  Publication  Sources    
From the Table 2, it is observed that the total publications  are 802 for the period of 5 years. It includes journal articles,  conference  papers,  and  other  resources.  It  can  be  seen  that  number  of  journal  articles  are  highest  form  of  publications  in  comparison  to  other  forms.  Study  cover  463  publications  published by these women faculty in academic journals during  2011-2015. 
5.3 Year-wise  Distribution    
year-wise  distribution  of  publications  is  an  important  indicator of publications productivity of an Institution. The total  year-wise  productivity  of  seven  institutions  for  fve  years  is  represented chronologically in Table 3. It can be seen that 2015  is the most productive year i.e. 144 (24.3%) in publication of  journal articles and conference papers collectively followed by  2014 with 132 (22.3%) publications. Institution-wise analysis  shows that University of Delhi is the leading institution among  seven  institutes  with  168  (28.3%)  publications  followed  by  CSIR-National Physical Laboratory with 158 (26.6%) in both- Journal articles and Conference papers. 
5.4 Authorship  Pattern    
Table 4 presents the data on the pattern of authorship of  conference papers and journal articles. It is seen that only a  miniscule number of papers both for conference and journal

Similar pattern have been observed  for conference papers where six papers were single authored  and rest 124 are two or more authored. Highest proportion of  journal papers have been authored by more than fve authors,  while  in  case  of  conference  publications  highest  proportion  of papers is three authored. It indicates that physics research  performed at these institutions is highly collaborative.

5.5 Collaborative  Coefficient    
This  measure  examines  the  strength  of  co-authorship.  Different  authors  have  suggested  different  measures  for  measuring  the  strength  of  collaboration.  Lawani10   suggested  Collaborative  Index  (CI),  while  Subramanyam11   suggested  Degree  of  Collaboration  (DC).  Ajiferuke12   pointed  out  the  inadequacy in these two measures and suggested Collaborative  Coeffcient  (CC),  which  incorporates  some  of  the  merits  of  these  two  measures.  This  measure  is  based  on  fractional  productivity defned by Price and Beaver13  and is given by the  formula given as follows: 
k 
CC =− 1 
∑ 
j=1( 1 / )jF 
j 
N 
Here Fj denotes the number of j  authored research papers,  N  denotes total number of research papers published and  k is the  greatest number of authors per paper. According to Ajiferuke12,  CC  tends to zero as single authored papers dominate and to  1-1/j  as j-authored papers dominate. This implies that higher

The calculation is based on 463 journal articles and 130  conference papers published by women scholars in collaboration  with their male colleagues during 2011-2015. The value of CC  indicates here that multi-authorship is dominating in both the  publications-journal  articles  and  conference  papers.  Hence,  it can be said that authors preferred to work in collaboration  rather than individual. 
5.6 Research  Interest Areas/Specialisations 
Table 5 represents the research areas and specialisations of  women faculties and it can be inferred that majority of faculties  research interest area is condensed matter physics. Out of 44,  11 women faculties are working in the area of condensed matter  physics. The other areas were engineering physics, materials  science, molecular physics and nuclear physics.

5.7 Preferred  Position  of Women Authors 
In  this  study  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  analyse  the  place  of  authorship  when  writing  research  papers  jointly.  Table 6 indicate that out of 463  journal articles, the women  authors  were  as  frst  author  in  70  (15.2%)  publications,  as  second  author  in  137  (29.6%)  publications,  as  third  author  in 95 (20.5%) publications, and so on. The remaining places  were from 6 to 53rd  author of publications. It can be inferred  that  Institution  wise  National  Physical  Laboratory’s  women  authors have preferred to write articles as a frst author than  other positions and same in IP University. But as the analysis  shows they have preferred to be second author of publications  that is highest in number of publications.

5.8 Rank  List  of  most  Productive Women Authors 
As shown in Table 7, it was found that in seven institutions  there  were  44  women  faculties  and  out  of  them,  the  study  reveals  that  Ratnamala  Chatterjee  is  the  most  productive  author with 54 publications followed by S. Annapoorni with  33,  Ranjana mehrotra  with  27  and  Amarjeet  Kaur  with  26  publications in journal articles. 
5.9 Highly  Cited  Research  Papers  where  Women  
Authors  Collaborated 
Appendix A  represents 10 highly cited research papers of  women  authors. The  highest  citations  received  by  paper  are  120. Out of 10, fve papers are written by Amita Chandra as a  co-author, University of Delhi. The least number of citations  listed in the table received by a paper are 44. The analysis of  distribution of citations cited by Indian journals and foreign  journals,  it  was  found  that  these  papers  received  maximum  citations  from  foreign  journals.  Out  of  10,  only  4  papers  received  citations  in  Indian  journals  but  very  less  e.g.  one  citation out of 120 citations and so on. 
5.10   Year-wise  Break-up  in  Indian  and  Foreign  
Journals 
The  analysis  of  year-wise  break-up  of  journal  articles  reveals that out of 463 journal articles, only 47 (10.1%) were  published in Indian journals and rest 416 (89.9%) articles in  Foreign journals. So a big difference can be seen from Table  8  that  women  faculties  collaboratively  are  publishing  their  research  work  in  International  journals  more  in  comparison  to  Indian  journals.  It  is  a  co-incidence  that  consecutively  in  three years-2011, 2012 and 2013 each, there were 08 articles   published in Indian journals. In both Indian journals and foreign  journals  2015  is  the  most  productive  year  in  publication  of  articles. 
5.11   Country-wise  Distribution  
Table  9  presents  the  data  on  countries  of  publications  of journal articles. It was found in the analysis that total 14  countries  were  involved  in  publishing  of  articles,  of  which  USA origin leading with 169 (36.5%) publications, followed  by Netherlands with 112 (24.2%) and UK with 100 (21.6%).   Rest 10 countries shares publications between 16 to one. It can  be  observed  from  the  analysis  that  Institution-wise  National  Physical Laboratory is leading with 44 publications from USA  followed by University of Delhi (50) and IIT with 39.The other

6.  FINDINGS AND  CONCLUSIONS 8 
The major fndings of the study are drawn  9 
on the basis of analysis done during the period  10 
of 2011-15 
10 
• It  is  identifed  during  the  study  that  300  10 
faculties were found in the seven institutions  11 
in  Delhi,  among  which  only  44  are  women  11 faculties. Highest number of women strength  11 is  from  CSIR-National  Physical  Laboratory  
and lowest in Jamia millia Islamia. It  is  noteworthy  to  mention  that  among  sources  of  publications, highest research output is published in the  form of journal articles. 
It is found that 2015 is the most productive year with 107  articles (23.1%) in physics and CSIR-National Physical  Laboratory was leading institution in publishing journal  articles with 145 articles.  
Of the 463 journal articles only 2 were single authored  and rest 461 have been authored by two or more authors.  Similar pattern have been observed for conference papers  where six papers were single authored and rest 124 are  two or more authored. The value of CC, 0.7217-Journal  articles and 0.6939 for Conference papers also indicates  that  physics  research  performed  at  these  institutions  is  highly collaborative.
