ABSTRACT 
This paper evaluates the citation count of article publications in journals by faculty members in the Humanities  and Social Science (HSS) Departments of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. The publication data is  retrieved from the individual bio-sketch and annual reports available in the websites for 17 year from 2000-2016.  Web of Science database has been used for counting the citations. Parameters like total publications in journals,  most preferred journal for publication, highly cited journals, collaborative status of faculty publications and thereby  their citation counts, faculty member receiving highest citation are studied. The fnding reveals that 623 articles are  found in total 359 journal. There is an increasing trend in the number of publications over the years. The journal  named  Psychological  Studies  ranked  frst  with  27  publication  of  faculties  whereas  Journal  of  Business  Ethics  received highest citations and grabbed the frst position amongst the journals. Collaborative researches by three  author received maximum citations. The faculty members are engaged in variant felds of research but the impact is  higher at national level than that of international level. Sage is found to be the most preferred publisher publishing  journal articles of the faculty members from HSS Departments of IIT, Kharagpur.

Bibliometrics 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Faculty  publications  of  any  institute  and  appraisal  of  it  has  immense  value  in  the  inspection  of  performance  of  the  institute. The publications of faculty members is regarded as  one of the criteria in order to rank the University/Institute in  20161. It has been noticed that in Indian and world academia,  more  studies  were  done  on  natural/pure  sciences  relatively  to humanities and social sciences2. Since, journals have been  very popular means for spreading of innovative thoughts and  research communications, this work plans to inspect the journal  publication output of all the full-time faculty members of (HSS)  Departments of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.  It  thereby  studies  the  citation  count  of  these  publications.  Citation analysis has emerged as a more signifcant and vital  means for assessing research excellence all the way through  the  development  and  use  of  various  impact  indicators  for  e.g. journals, universities and institutions. Moreover, citation  analysis is regarded as one of the major and popular branches of  bibliometrics3. Citation analysis is also very much important to  discover the bang of any journal, for acquiring the knowledge  of comparative and up-to-date information of the literature or  to sketch the knowledge-dissemination patterns4. In this regard,  the publication data is retrieved from the individual bio-sketch  and annual reports available in the websites for over 17 years  from 2000-2016. For citation count, Web of Science database  
Received : 31 August 2018, Revised : 12 October 2018  Accepted : 15 October 2018, Online published : 2 November 2018 
has been used. This study will go afar of the academic norms  and will showcase how well these scholarly publications are  being cited or identifed by the intellectual society. 
2. RELATED WORKS 
Gautam  and  Mishra5 investigated  the  scholarly  research  trends of Banaras Hindu University and collected 1041 article  from  Indian  Citation  Index  from  2004-2013.  They  studied  year-wise distribution, authorship pattern, collaborative work  etc. Results showed, out of 1041 publication, 163 (15.66 %)  were  added  by  single-author  and  the  most  dynamic  authors  are  A.K.  Singh  and  Arvind  Singh  of  Physics  and  Botany  department  respectively.  Gopikuttan  and  Aswathy6 showed  the scientometric view of publication from Kerala University.  They collected data from Web of Science for 13 year (2000  -  2012).  Year-wise,  subject-wise,  most  industrious  authors,  preferred journals etc. are considered for the study. Khaparde7  analysed  the  research  publications  of  Chemistry  department  of  Dr.  Babasaheb  Ambedkar  Marathwada  University  in  Aurangabad from 1975-2012. He analysed 774 publications in  144 journals. He examined year- wise distribution, authorship  pattern, faculty productivity etc. and found that the researches  have improved constantly from 1975 - 2012.  
Maharana and Sethi8 investigated the research production  of  Sambalpur  University  and  collected  data  from  Web  of  Science from 2007 to 2011. They studied total contribution,  growth  pattern,  authorship  pattern,  collaboration  etc  and  found  amongst  170  research  papers,  Chemistry  department

contributed  utmost  papers  with  35.29  per  cent.  Nagarkar9,  et  al.  studied  the  publications  of  faculty  members  of  Life  sciences department at the university  and found much increase  in research productivity and good publication citations. Total  690  papers  in  362  journals,  obtained  6210  citations  and  Current Science is the preferred journal. Radhakrishnan and  Velmurugan10 investigated  the  publications  done  by  faculties  from Periyar University. Data assembled from Web of Science  from 1998 to 2014. Findings revealed that out of 703 articles,  148  were  brought  out  in  2014.  Dr. V.  Krishnakumar  ranked  frst  in  number  of  outputs  with  111  publications.  Sharma11  investigated 2603 articles contributed by the authors of Central  Potato Research Institute (CPRI) during the year 1991 to 2007.  For data collection he considered annual reports of CPRI and  the  Journal  of  the  Indian  Potato  Association.  He  revealed  authors preferred to publish papers collaboratively and in year  2003 maximum papers are published. Sudhier12 analysed the  publications of physicists at the Indian Institute of Science and  Kerala University during 2004-2008. He analysed 352 articles  from  doctoral  theses  of  Physics  of  both  the  institutions  and  found that multi-authored papers are maximum from IISc and  single authored papers are maximum from Kerala University  and the most familiar publisher is Elsevier.  
Sudhier  and  Priyalakshmi13  analysed  the  scientist’s  publication output of Central Tuber Crops Research Institute  (CTCRI), Thiruvananthapuram. They collected 1076 research  articles  from  annual  report  and  concluded  that  169  papers  published in 2006. Much publication is made by three authors  and made known in the foreign journals. Tamilselvan14 studied  the research activity of all NITs in India from Web of Science,  Scopus  and  EI  Compendex  database.  He  concentrated  on  their searches on science that includes collaboration research,  authorship  pattern,  core  journal  outputs  by  Bradford’s  law,  geographical output etc.  
Condic15 studied the citations in dissertations of students  and faculties in reading and educational leadership at Oakland  University from pre web 1983 to post web 2014.75 dissertations  and  63  faculty  articles  were  taken  into  consideration  which  resulted in 11,082 cited items. He analysed diverse document  types  that  were  cited  during  the  period.  Khalifa16   analysed  the Saudi publication productivity in computer science from  1978-2012 as covered by Web of Science. A totality of 998  publications were examined and found productivity increased  in computer science feld after 2007 and the computer science  research  trends  focused  on  engineering,  mathematics  and  telecommunications.  Moghaddam17,  et  al.  examined  the  faculty publications of Allameh Tabatabai University of Iran  as indexed in science citation index and Scopus from 1987 to  2015. Scientometric techniques were used and co-authorship  network were analysed. Faculty members mostly collaborated  with U.S and Switzerland and jointly authored papers are more  predominant. 
3. RESEARCH GAP  
All the above works are vital in their own way, but no study  has been identifed which has tried to showcase the collaborative  status of the faculty members and thereby their citation counts.  Also, the publication trend in relation to citation received by  
404 
the journals is left unidentifed. So, this study will try to spot  the  citations  of  the  authors,  citations  received  in  addition  to  fnding out the other parameters like collaboration status, highly  preferred journal for publication and highly cited journals.

5. METHODOLOGY AND  SCOPE 
This  paper  studies  the  journal  publications  of  full-time  faculty members of Humanities and Social Science department  from the website of IIT Kharagpur18 as revealed on July 21,  2017. The author’s publications in the journals are collected  from  the  individual  bio-sketch  of  the  faculty  members  and  annual reports available in the institute’s website for 17 years  from 2000-2016.The citation count is done till November 2017  from Web of Science database. The various parameters such  as  total  publications  in  journals,  journal  preferences,  highly  cited journals, top publishers etc. are considered and then the  collected data has been tabulated by using excel spreadsheet for  analysis and drawing the conclusion. The scope of the study is  limited to the 25 full time faculty members of humanities and  social science department of IIT Kharagpur. 
6. LIMITATIONS  
The  study  is  limited  for  a  certain  period  of  time  and  confned  to  the  full-time  faculty  members.  Data  is  collected  from  institute’s  departmental  website  and  annual  reports,  so  some  of  the  faculty  member’s  bio-sketch  as  well  as  annual  reports,  which  are  not  uploaded  or  updated  and  are  under  maintenance, could not be accessed and therefore if they had  made  more  number  of  publications  then  it  could  have  been  missed. For citation count, only the Web of Science database  is considered. 
7.   ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS 
7.1    Number  of  Publications  in  Journals 
The  publications  are  spread  over  359  journals.  In  total  

========2========

BHUI  & S AHU : PUBLICATIONS BY  F ACULTY  M EMBERS OF  H UMANITIES AND  S OCIAL  S CIENCE  D EPARTMENTS OF  IIT K HARAGPUR 
623  articles  are  published  from  2000-2016  by  25  full  time  faculty members of humanities and social science departments  of IIT Kharagpur. Though there is a general conception that  researchers  in  humanities  and  social  sciences  are  inclined  towards writing a book but here the number of articles says  that it is somewhat false. 
7.2 Rolling Year  in  Five-Year  Publication  Period 
It  has  been  observed  from  the  study  
that if we consider a five-year rolling period  
then the maximum number of publications is  
made during the period 2010-2014 followed  
Journals by the years 2005-2009. As 102 publications  
are  already  made  in  just  the  last  two  year  
period 2015-16, so we may always think that  
it will definitely supersede all other rolling  
five years in the number of publications. So  
Psychology we  may  claim  that  there  is  an  increasing  
trend in the number of publications over the  
five  year  periods  as  shown  in  Table  1.  Stress 
Journal of Business Ethics 
Journal of Environmental

7.3 Top  Five  Journals  with  Number  of  Publications 
The  Table  2  depicts  the  top  fve  journals  in  which  the  faculty members of HSS department of IIT Kharagpur prefer  to publish their article. Psychological Studies  which deals with  
the discipline of social science is the most preferred journal  for  publication  in  which  27  articles  have  been  published.  Second and third selection of journal by the faculty members  of HSS department is Economic and Political Weekly  which  also deals with the Social Science discipline and Muse India  of  humanities discipline in which 20 and 12 articles are published  respectively.  The  fourth  position  is  bagged  by  the  journal

named Management and Labour Studies where 9 publications  are made. From the table it is clear that the faculties from social  science discipline are engaged in writing more journal articles  than  the  faculty  members  from  humanities  discipline.  This  may be due to the focus of faculty members from humanities  discipline towards books than that of journals.  
7.4  Top Ten  Highly  Cited  Journals 
The  journals  in  which  faculty  publications  from  HSS  department  of  IIT  Kharagpur  received  highest  number  of  citations  with  respect  to  the  number  of  publications  are  provided  in  Table  3.  Here  the  top  10  journals  that  received  highest citations as depicted in Web of Science database are  shown.  The Journal  of  Business  Ethics with  only  3  articles  published  by  Springer  ranked  frst  with  maximum  number  of  citations  i.e.  166  and  showed  its  greater  visibility  and  acceptability among the peers. The journal that ranked second  is the Journal of Environmental Psychology  with 38 citations  for just 1 article followed by the  Journal Tourism Management  with  31  citations  for  1  article.  It  is  seen  from  the  table  that  out of the eleven journals that held the top rank in citations,  fve of the journals were published by Elsevier. This may be  due to the greater visibility of Elsevier journals in the feld of  social  sciences  particularly. Also  noted  point  here  is  that  all

are international publishers receive maximum citations and no  Indian publisher is found in the list.  
7.5  Collaboration  Status  of  the  Faculty  Members 
The Table 4 shows the collaboration status of the faculty  members and thereby their citation counts. It depicts that the  journal articles published by three authors received maximum  citations  when  considered  in  terms  of  citation  per  article;  followed by the journal articles published by more than four  authors and then in similar ratio of citations published by two  authors and four authors. So it is clear that collaborative works

received more citations than the article published singly. This  may be due to the fact that multiple-authorship brings more  recognition as the number of search by author access points  increases. Also when researchers work in collaboration more  ideas are generated which improves the quality of publications  and makes it worth.  
7.6 Top  Five  Faculty  with  Number  of  Publications 
The Table 5 ranks the top 5 faculty members with highest  number of publications. It clearly shows that Anjali Gera Roy of  Humanities discipline ranked frst with 67 journal publications,  Damodar Suar of Social Science discipline ranked second with  57 journal publications followed by Vijai Nath Giri, Kailash  Bihari Lal Srivastava and Bhagirath Behera with 47, 43, and 41  publications of social science discipline, respectively. Though  here it has been observed that among the fve faculty members  making highest number of publications, four are from social  science discipline but the top rank in number of publications is  occupied by a faculty member from humanities discipline. So  it is proved that if somebody has personal fair in writing for  journals, the discipline is immaterial. If we consider the area  of research of the faculty members we can see from the table  above  that  each  of  them  are  engaged  in  multi-dimensional  research areas.  So we can say that they have multi-dimensional  expertise  which  makes  their  articles  easily  acceptable  in  reputed journals. 
7.7  Top  Five  Faculty  Members  Receiving  Highest  
Citations 
The  Table  6  ranks  the  top  5  faculty  members  with  highest number of citations received by the faculty members.  It clearly shows that each of the faculty members belong to  the Social science discipline. Damodar Suar ranked frst with  331citations  in  journal  articles,  Bhagirath  Behera  ranked  second with 154 citations followed by Zakir Husain, Kishor  Goswami and Jitendra Mahakud who received 82, 36, and 35  citations, respectively. So comparing Tables 5 and 6 it can be  concluded  that  if  we  judge  the  publications  in  journal  with  respect to citations received, then we can say that the faculty  member from exclusively Social science discipline, Damodar  Suar  makes  more  qualitative  publications  though  he  ranked  second  in  terms  of  number  of  publications  in  journal. Also  some  faculty  members  like  Zakir  Husain,  Kishor  Goswami  and Jitendra Mahakud who did not ranked in top fve in the  number of publications got ranks third, fourth and ffth in terms  of citations received and therefore can be said to produce much  more qualitative papers. Quality of the paper and visibility are  the  two  most  important  factors  which  count  when  we  look  for  citation  study.  If  we  consider  the  area  of  research  from  the above table we may say that Damodar Suar who received  the highest number of citations has Research Methodology as  one of his areas of research, so it is very obvious that he will  receive citations not only from his own discipline researchers  but  also  from  researchers  in  variant  disciplines  as  Research  methodology is common area in almost every feld of study  nowadays. Bhagirath Behera who ranked second in the number  of citations works for some of the emerging felds of knowledge  like Green economics, Economics for religion etc which makes  
his  works  more  popular  among  the  other  researchers  in  the  feld. 
7.8  IMPACT OF THE STUDY: NATIONAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL 
From the Table 7 it is clear that the impact at the national  level is greater than that of the international level in three out  of the fve cases. This may be due to the more familiarity of the  faculty members of IITs in India than that of abroad. Also the  research areas of these faculty members may be more popular  among  Indian  authors  and  therefore  receives  more  attention  from their end.

Number  of  Journal Articles 
The  Table  8  shows  top  fve  publishers  who  published  maximum  number  of  journal  articles  of  faculty  members.  Amongst them, Sage published maximum number of works of  faculty members and ranked frst with 62 publications followed  by Springer which ranked second with 58 publications. Taylor  and Francis, Elsevier and Sameeksha Trust ranked third, fourth  and  ffth  respectively.  Sage  has  huge  scope  for  both  Social  science and Humanities discipline and therefore the intellectual  community prefers them as publishers when compared to others.  Springer and Elsevier are famous for science publications but  still they are in the list probably because of their recognition  throughout the world.

science departments of IIT Kharagpur 
An increasing trend in the number of publications is found  if we consider the fve year rolling period 
Most  of  the  faculty  members  are  inclined  to  publish  their  research  article  in  the  top  three  journals  named  Psychological Studies, Economic and Political Weekly and  Muse India. The frst two are the journals of Social science  and the third one is from the discipline of Humanities Journal of Business Ethics  published by Springer is the  most  highly  cited  journal  among  the  group  though  in  terms of publications it is not included in top ten journals,  followed  by   Journal  of  Environmental  Psychology ,  published by Elsevier which again does not rank among  the top fve journals in terms of publications 
The study reveals that the journal articles published by  three  authors  received  maximum  number  of  citations  followed by collaboration by more than four authors when  considered in terms of citation per article which confrms  that collaborative works received more citations than the  article published singly 
Among  the  faculty  members,  Anjali  Gera  Roy  of  Humanities  discipline  ranked  frst  with  highest  number  of  publications  but  Damodar  Suar  of  Social  science  discipline  ranked  frst  when  numbers  of  citations  are  considered  for  the  faculty  members. This  confrms  that  Damodar Saur made more qualitative publications though  he ranked second in terms of number of publications in  journal. The study reveals that the faculty members are  engaged in variant felds of research and are not confned  only to a specifc area. However they have greater national  impact than international impact as found from the citation  count. 
Among the publishers who published the works of faculty  members as journal articles, Sage stands at the top most  position,  followed  by  Springer  and Taylor  and  Francis.  Conversely  we  can  say  that  faculty  members  mostly  prefer Sage Publishers to publish their works. 
9.   CONCLUSIONS 
Journal  publications  are  an  indicator  of  research  productivity  from  an  institution  as  a  whole.  Citation  count  on the other hand is the depiction of quality of any work, its  visibility,  acceptability  among  peers,  relevance  of  the  work  for the society and research etc. The study reveals that 25 full  time faculty members i.e. 4 from humanities department and  21 from social science department have published 623 articles  in  all  over  359  journals.  These  faculty  members  belong  to  different disciplines such as English language and literature,  German,  Philosophy  and  Sanskrit  of  humanities  group  and  communication  studies,  economics,  psychology,  human  resource  management,  history,  sociology,  and  linguistics  of  social  science  group  in  IIT  Kharagpur.  In  comparison  to  humanities, more number of faculty members are present in  social science department. The study also reveals that quantity  in publications alone does not produce more citations.  Faculty  members  prefer  Sage  from  other  publication  houses  which  qualify its popularity in social science and humanities discipline.  The increase in collaboration of researchers is a clear sign of

rising professionalism in different felds of knowledge, which  is a motto of digital humanities.
