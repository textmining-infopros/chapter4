The present paper investigates the distance students’ use of public libraries for their academic purposes and  converse the public library as a alternate for instructive or University libraries. The current research study is  based on a comprehensive survey of distance education students from Bangalore University. The data collection  was carried out by personally distributing the questionnaire to the randomly selected students and the sample  consists  of  students  from  both  undergraduate  and  post  graduate.  It is found from the study that 1309 (90.60  %) distance learners who used public libraries during contact classes and 786 (54.4 %) of the respondents spent  0-1 h in the library. Majority of the distance learners i.e. 941 (65.10 %) responded effective for book borrowing  services from the public libraries in seeking information, 1220 (84.40 %) opined effective for reference services.  It is observed from the study that distance students have a tendency to look at libraries as a complete and do  not make apparent difference between different types of libraries, expecting the entire system to be fawless.  The paper lifts the signifcant executive inquiry and apprehension in relation to both the operation of public  libraries and the service level given to diverse section of learning students. It is strongly recommended that  library instruction programme should be organized by the public libraries for distance learners that create the  responsiveness and use of library and information services effectively.

1. IntroDUctIon 
Public libraries have a positive impact on achievement of  distance  learning  students  by  providing  them  with  abundant  information.  Generally  distance  students  of  all  ages  may  lack exposure to reading, writing, and learning opportunities  without  attending  conventional  educational  system,  that  are  required to overcome knowledge gaps. Public libraries have  been  very  much  considered  as  information  providers  for  all  the information seekers and all community members who can  utilise to their beneft, in spite of the demographic background  and socio-economic status. 
Public  libraries  are  the  community  transformers  and  intellectual  heritage  centres  of  scholarly  inheritance  of  knowledge  persons  and  also  the  guiding  light  in  fostering  resourceful leisure time activities. At present Karnataka State  has one state central library, 30 district center libraries and 26  urban center libraries and 490 branches that are open to the  public  community. Also  small  libraries  have  been  started  at  5766 Gram Panchayat Centers for rural people. As well as the  elderly, 14 catalog libraries are working to provide books on  the doorstep for women. The State / District and Urban Council  Authorities are functioning in order to organize and implement  their action plans and supervise their implementation. These  libraries provide important services. They provide access to a  wide range of information resources such as books, periodicals,  reference materials etc.1.

Public  Library  is  a  free  public  organization.  It  is  signifcant that the Public Library is called the University of  Common Man. The Government of Karnataka established the  Karnataka Public Library Act in 1965 and laid the foundation  for the development of network of public libraries in the state  in the year 1965. Our state has gained the dominant status of  the public library system in the country1. 
National  Knowledge  Commission2   of  India  strongly  emphasises  the  signifcance  of  developing  Indian  higher  education. It focuses on the substance of escalating the number  of higher education institutes and become accustomed to new  instructive methods such as distance learning and e-learning  programmes.  Public  libraries  information  services  have  an  imperative role to play in this inventiveness to support distance  learning activities. The current research study has reported here  recommends that the current support for distance learning, in  terms of knowledge resources, education and consultation, is  inadequate. 
A very signifcant component in any educational system  is  an  apparent  understanding  of  teachers  and  their  learner’s  needs.  India  is  among  those  countries  that  are  interested  in  humanizing  their  higher  education  systems  and  institutions  in order to make them correspondent to the most well known  educational  institutes  around  the  world  and  to  make  them  available  to  all  populace  who  need  them.  It  is  observed  in  IFLA/UNESCO Public Library Manifesto, the public library  is the local centre of information, making available all kinds of  knowledge and information readily available to its clients.

public library services are provided on the basis of equality of  access for all, regardless of age, race, sex, religion, nationality,  language or social status. Particular services and materials must  be provided for those users who cannot, for whatever reason,  use the regular services and materials, for example linguistic  minorities,  people  with  disabilities  or  people  in  hospital  or  prison3. 
2. LIterAtUre revIew 
Barsun4  opines that it is the natural tendency of distance  education students to expect their local public library to meet  their academic needs. She also stressed on the fact that distance  learners access public library because of its easy accessibility,  adequate parking facility, fast web access, and inter-library loan  services. She also notes that they are frequently frustrated by  their unrealistic expectations of the local library’s resources and  services. She presents the examples of public libraries which,  through  grants  and  other  funding  sources  have  successfully  added  programmes  and  services  to  support  community  distance  learners.  Her  study  also  has  some  constructive  appendices which include suggestions on effective functioning  of the librarian and public library when they have to meet the  requirement of distance learners. 
Dority5  conducted a study of the same issue with respect  to  distance  students  from  the  Open  University  of  Tanzania  to  examine  the  use  of  public  library.  This  particular  study  revealed that inadequate library resources, insuffcient reading  space, fee to utilise the library, lack of professional staff and  distance between the place of their residence and the library  acted as limited factors. These negative factors prompted the  author to raise her concern regarding lack of coordination and  commitment of the staff to meet the needs of distance learners.  She argued that resources must be mobilised and awareness  must be created among the staff to address the shortcomings in  the administration of the programme. 
Mutambo6  studied the use of public libraries in Makerere  University and the fndings of the study revealed that 74 per cent  of the distance students very much used the public libraries.  The study observed the role of public libraries in supporting  distance learners in Makerere University, exploring the factors  which affect utilisation of their services. The study had adopted  a survey design with 300 education students, collecting data  through  focus  group  discussions,  structured  questionnaires  and individual interviews. The study results showed that some  of the distance students have been utilising the services and  facilities offered by the public libraries, especially 74 per cent  of the students used the Internet and online databases. 73 per  cent of them also benefted from technical staff, 63 per cent  utilised  the  reading  space  and  study  materials  by  about  42  per  cent.  However,  a  large  percentage  of  about  58  per  cent  said there are no study materials and supplementary reading  materials by 63 per cent. 74 per cent of the students who had  visited the library confrmed that they had access to Internet  and other IT facilities. 
Kishorekumar7  have  collected the  attitude  from  the Citizens  of Tumkur city as  the  users  of  District  Public Library,  Tumkur,  Karnataka.  They  used Questionnaire based  survey method to identify the feelings of public towards the

4.   r eSeArch  MethoDoLogy 
The  present  study  collected  the  primary  data  by  using  the  survey  instrument.  A  structured  questionnaire  was  designed to achieve the objectives of the research study which  was  distributed  among  the  distance  learners  of  Bangalore  University. The data collected among 1445 distance learners  was then entered in excel and analysed under the light of set  objectives fnding the frequencies and percentage using SPSS  software, a statistical package for social sciences. The collected  and analysed data was represented in the form of tables. The  data  was  collected  during  July-November  2016,  when  the  contact classes were held in the study centres and University  post graduate departments. 1550 respondents were randomly  selected from the study centres and post graduate departments  of Bangalore University out of which 1445 completely flled  questionnaires were received. 
5. DAtA   Pre SentAtIon AnD  An ALySIS 
Out  of  1550  copies  of  the  survey  questionnaire  administered, 1445 (93.22 %) were completed and returned.  Data were presented for analysis using the descriptive statistics  which  include  frequency  count  percentages  and  tables.  The  distance  students  included  for  research  study  belong  to  undergraduate (BA, BCom and BBM) and postgraduate (MA,  MSc and MCom) 
Table  1  revealed  that  73.7  per  cent  of  the  respondents  aged between 20-30 years, 19.1 per cent of them were in the  age group of 31-40 years, 6.3 per cent were in the age group of  41-50 years and remaining 0.9 per cent of them were above 50  years of age. As far as the educational status (qualifcation) is  concerned 39.4 per cent were undergraduate (BA, BCom and  BBM) students and 60.6 per cent (MA, MSc, and MCom) were  postgraduate students. 
Table  2  reveals  that  829  respondents  were  males  representing  57.40  per  cent  of  the  sample  population,  while  616  respondents  were  the  female  respondents  making  the  remaining 42.60 per cent of the sample population.

Chi-square  (X2 =  1869.952;  p=.000)  test  revealed  a  signifcant  difference,  and  confrms  that  public  library  provides  employment  information  services  effective.  Further, associations between the responses with gender, area  and course revealed that gender and course have signifcance  of  associations  (at  CV=.086;  p=.031  and  CV=.203;  p=.000  respectively).  Gender  wise  analysis  revaled  that  female  respondents  indicated  higher  effectiveness  than  their  male  counterparts  and  course  wise  UG  students  indicated  higher  performance than PG students. 
Table 8 depicts the data about the public library services  for competitive examinations information and it is found that  a large majority i.e. 1245 (86.20 %), of the respondents opined  effective  followed  by  173  (12.0  %)  expressed  ineffective,  22 (1.50 %) felt it somewhat effective and 5 (0.30 %) were  undecided. Chi-square test (X2 = 2929.984; p=.000) revealed  a  signifcant  difference  between  frequency  groups  and  confrms that public library service to be used as competitive  examinations  information  service  provider  which  is  also  effective.  The  study  of  associations  between  the  responses  with gender, area and course revealed that gender and course  have  signifcance  of  associations  (at  CV=.077;  p=.034  and  CV=.168; p=.000 respectively). When gender was compared,  more of female respondents indicated higher effectiveness and  in the case of course, it is observed that more of PG students  feel this service is ineffective. 
6. PUBLIc  LIBrAry  ServIceS 
Table 9 shows the data relating to distance learners opinion  on whether the public library is serving its educational purpose.  
Majority of the respondents i.e. 913 (63.20%) agreed that it  is  serving  its  education  purpose  followed  by  169  (11.70%)  strongly agreed, 155 (10.70%) were undecided, 150 (10.40%)  strongly  disagreed  and  remaining  58  (4.00%)  disagreed  that  public  library  is  serving  its  educational  purpose.  Chi-square  revealed a signifcant difference between groups of frequencies  (X2=1710.775; p=.000) confrming that public library service  serving  for  the  education  purpose  is  effective.  Associations  between the responses with gender, area and course revealed  that course alone has signifcance of associations (at CV=.272;  p=.000) where we can see that PG students (78.80%) show of  more agreement compared to UG students showing (24.6%)  disagreement.

7.1   g eographical  Barriers 
It is observed from the study that the distance education  learners are isolated along the distance across the state. The  study  examined  signifcant  fndings  such  as  the  inability  of  distance learners to access library and information resources.  The  study  however  strongly  recommends  closing  these  distance gap, University need to provide equitable library and  information  access  to  distance  learners  as  close  as  par  with  regular on campus students. In addition to this by developing  strong  active  library  networks  with  affliated  colleges  and  public  libraries  and  also  discuss  with  information  providers  to  smack  better  learner  and  user  friendly  authoritative  and  information access models. 
Another major barrier among the distance learners is the  lack  of  awareness  for  library  and  information  resources  and  its  services. The  study  revealed  that  the  distance  learners  at  Bangalore University had reasons for not using the library and  information resources, among them are lack of awareness of  the services offered by the library. 
8. SUMMAry  oF  the  F InDIngS 
The study was carried out to examine the use of public  library services by the Bangalore University distance learners  in  facilitating  their  education  and  the  fndings  of  the  study  shows that the majority of the students were using it during the  contact class and it is observed that more number of students  spent less than one hour in the library and only a 25.70 per cent  of them used between 1 h to 2 h. 
Public  library  book  borrowing  services  is  effective  as  most  of  the  distance  learners  were  depending  on  these  resources; effectiveness of reference services is also effective  as 84.40 per cent of the students were happy with the services  offered  by  the  public  library.  Employment  and  Competitive  Examinations Information Services was also found effective  during the study.  
In  addition,  respondents  agreed  that  Public  library  is  serving  for  educational  and  entertainment  purposes  and  providing  local,  national  news  to  its  patrons. And  when  the  importance of the public library was asked 41.50 per cent of  the  distance  learners  strongly  agreed  followed  by  33.90  per  
cent  agreed  that  is  important  in  serving  the  academic  and  non academic needs of the distance learners. It was observed  from the study that these students are facing few challenges  such as location of the library and lack of information literacy  programme. 
9.   c oncLUSIonS 
Public libraries are expected to provide people-oriented  services11. These public libraries are aiming at satisfying the  general public through the provision of appropriate information  resources  and  services,  such  as  advisory  services,  planned  leadership, and information on local content that incorporates  indigenous knowledge system into it12.  
Library instruction programme should be organised by the  Bangalore University Library and public libraries for distance  learners  that  create  the  awareness  and  use  of  library  and  information services. The outcome of challenge is that distance  learners who register on distance learning program may under- utilised the library resources. Moreover, geographical isolation  was  recognized  as  a  major  barrier  to  distance  students.  In  addition  to  this,  lack  of  time  and  library  operating  timings,  fear of using the library were some of the barriers faced by  distance students. This has lead to the feelings of insuffciency  and uncertainty and lack of confdence on the part of distance  learners. And in this background that the researcher explored  the  intensity  of  accessibility  of  public  library  services  to  distance learners. To conclude, it is customary that geographical  separation  is  actually  leading  to  feelings  of  inadequacy  and  insecurity of library and information resources to the distance  learners. 
In  reality  the  current  situation  create  an  implication  for  University  and  public  libraries,  librarians  and  the  state  administration as a whole13. For instance, to any educational  institutions, library and information services must be accessible  to distance learning students, as this services helps in bringing  out  excellence  among  them.  Since  the  distance  students  are  distantly  located  and  geographically  detached  with  uneven  ICT  facilities13-14,  the  challenge  lies  with  the  University  and  Public libraries and students using suitable technological tool  which appears exceptionally accessible and uneconomical. It  is signifcant to observe that despite the fact that this cannot  completely  sustain  information  literacy  training,  but  to  some extent, get rid of the sense of isolation felt by distance  learners.
