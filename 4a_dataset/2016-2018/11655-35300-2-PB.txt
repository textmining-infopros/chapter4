Contribution of Indian authors in foreign library and information science journals during 2006-2015 using  Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts  database is examined in this study. This scientometrics study  analyses the research publication productivity and trend according to year, authorship, most prolifc authors, Indian  states, institutions, preferred journals for communication and subject. It is found that Indian authors contributed a  total number of 234 articles during the covered period and collaborative articles with two-authors are highest in  numbers. Library Philosophy and Practice  has emerged as the most preferred journal by authors for publication.  In terms of keywords/areas of study ‘Users’ and Study’ has emerged as the most preferred research area to publish  
during the period. 
Keywords: Scientometrics study; Foreign LIS journals; Indian authors; Research productivity, LISTA database 
1.  IntroductIon 
The 20th  century may be described as the century of the  development of metric sciences like librametrics, bibliometrics,  scientometrics,  cybermetrics  or  webometrics  and  lastly  informatics1. The objective is to use quantitative techniques and  methods to assess the knowledge domain.  Scientometrics has  become prominent day by day because of the need to measure  and evaluate the huge investments in science and technology  (S&T)  sectors,  especially  in  research  and  development  activities2.  Journals  are  the  primary  communication  channel  in  disseminating  research  and  scholarly  information  and  publishing papers in high impact and good quality national as  well as international journals is strongly related with gaining  prestige,  reputation  and  academic  achievement  in  higher  education environment.  
After  independence,  increase  in  library  science  schools  and libraries of different types in India has provided impetus for  number of publications in the library and information science  (LIS) literature. As a result, signifcant number of national as  well as international journals has been launched to disseminate  the growing research output. Evaluating such foreign journal  literature would help us to identify the LIS domain, the research  trend  and  characteristics  pattern.  Therefore,  this  study  is  an  attempt to assess the LIS literature output by Indian authors in  foreign journals indexed in the LISTA database.

Harinarayana3,  et  al.  found  that  303  articles  were  published  during  1970-2005  in  various  foreign  LIS  journals  and  Scientometrics  is  the  most  preferred  foreign  journal  for

Indian authors. Subbaiah Arunachalam contributed maximum  articles and they also recommended that Indian authors should  give more attention to increase their level of productivity in  foreign periodicals. 
Wani4, et al. assessed the trend of LIS research literary  outputs  available  through  Library,  Information  Science  and  Technology Abstracts. This chronological study covering the  period  1850  to  2000  indicated  that  LIS  literature  has  been  expanding its subject boundaries and developing countries like  India have also made laudable contributions to LIS literature. In  county-wise output, U.S.A. ranked frst and India is positioned  at 6th  place. 
Chandrakar &  Arora5 analysed  302  journal  articles  literature that was published during the years 2000 to 2010 and  indexed in the SSCI database on the Web of Science platform.  This study revealed National Institute of Science Technology  & Development Studies published maximum articles and USA  topped in terms of co-authorship with the Indian institutions. 
Pradhan  &  Chandrakar6   in  their  study  revealed  that  Indian  authors  contributed  over  228  articles  in  foreign  LIS  journals during 2000-2009. Scientometrics journal published  maximum articles by Indian authors and K.C. Garg contributed  highest articles during the study period. The study concludes  that  international  collaboration  of  Indian  authors  has  less  representation. 
Rakhi & Nagarajan7 analysed the research trends in library  and information science in Asian countries during  1996-2011  as  refected  in  the  SCImago  Journal  and  country  ranking  (SJR)  database  and  depicted  that  China  contributed  highest  number of publications followed by India. Further, the trend  of  self  citing  is  dominating  among  the  researchers  in  China  and India.

barik & Jena8  analysed 385 articles published during 2004- 2013 and indexed by Scopus database. It is found that Library  Philosophy and Practice has been identifed as most favoured  LIS journal and the application of Lotka’s law revealed that the  numbers of authors observed are somehow different with the  numbers of authors expected.  
Mangi9  assessed the quantitative aspect of LIS research  output scenario of bRIC nations for the period 1996-2012 and  Britain stood frst among four nations, namely Britain, Russia,  India and China. britain has maximum number of publications  to its credit. China and India were also seen as contributing  signifcantly in LIS research output.  
Pradhan10  examined the 353 articles published in 41 LIS  journals contributed by the Indian authors during 2001-2010  and stated that that there was only a few set of core journals  where majority of LIS research was published. He concluded  that in the Indian scenario, LIS research activities need constant  improvement with contributions from all states and in multiple  international journals to meet the global need of the day. 
Sa & barik11  retrieved 200 scholarly papers from SCOPUS  database which were contributed by Indian LIS researchers in  Library Philosophy & Practice Journal  during 2001-2015 and  analysed the different bibliometric aspects like contribution of  papers by year, geographical distribution of papers, most active  authors, type of documents, most cited papers, most productive  institutions,  foreign  collaboration,  authorship  pattern  and  degree of collaboration etc. 
3.    o bJectIveS   o F  the  Study 
The present study assesses the articles publication pattern  and  trend  of  Indian  authors  in  foreign  LIS  journals.  The  objectives of the study are as follows:  
i. To  examine  the  year  wise  publication  of  articles  and  
growth rate  
ii. To understand the authorship pattern and collaboration of  
Indian authors  
iii. To identify the most prolifc Indian states, institutions and  
authors 
iv. To  illustrate  the  international  collaboration  of  Indian  
authors 
v. To depict the most preferred foreign journals by Indian  
authors and  
vi. To  fnd  out  the  emerging  research  areas  preferred  by  
Indian authors.  
4.  Scope and  MethodoLogy  
The present study is restricted to only research publication  output  of  Indian  authors  in  foreign  library  &  information  science  journals  which  are  indexed  by  LISTA  database  of  EbSCO. Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts  (LISTA)12   is  an  open-access  mega  indexing/abstracting  database  of  EbSCO.  This  reputed  bibliographic  database  covers librarianship, classifcation, information management,  and  indexes  more  than  700  periodicals  plus  books,  research  reports, and proceedings with coverage dating back to the mid- 1960s. 
For  information  retrieval,  following  limiters  have  been  used to refne the necessary data during 25th  November to 6 
th 
December, 2016.  
Geographic term: India 
Publication date: 01-01-2006 to 31-12-2015.  
Publication type: Academic Journal 
Document type: Article 
Language: English 
Total 1,379 articles have been retrieved and then from the  publication list, 33 foreign LIS journals (appendix) have been  selected to refne the relevant data. The bibliographical details  of each of the articles of search results have been thoroughly  scanned  and  verifed.  Finally,  a  total  of  234  journal  articles  which are written by the Indian affliated authors have been  shortlisted  and  retrieved  for  the  study.  This  has  also  been  supplemented  by  searching  and  verifying  Google  Scholar  online database to get the citation data of articles.  
The raw data are then analysed and recorded separately  in an MS-Excel fle. Then MS-Word and MS-Excel were used  to  organise,  tabulate  and  analyse  the  necessary  data  for  the  study. 
5.    d ata anaLySIS  and  InterpretatIon  
The authors analysed and interpreted the available data on  the basis of year wise distribution, authorship pattern, author  productivity,  most  prolifc  authors,  most  prolifc  state,  most  prolifc  institutions,  international  collaboration,  productive  journals and subject wise.  
5.1   y ear  wise  distribution  and relative growth  
rate      
Table  1  and  Fig.  1  depict  the  year  wise  distribution  and relative growth rate of articles published in foreign LIS  journals.  Indian  authors  contributed  a  total  number  of  234  journal articles during 2006 to 2015. It is clear from the fgure  that the growth rate is fuctuated during the period. There is  a sudden increase in the growth of articles in the years 2008,  2010  and  2011.  Otherwise,  uniformity  has  been  seen  in  the  publication trend of foreign LIS journals during last 10 years.  The relative growth rate shows that the growth of publications  is found to be positive in 2008, 2010, 2015 and the remaining  years indicate negative growth.  
The  relative  growth  rate  (RGR)  means  the  increase  in  a number of publications/Pages per unit of time. Hence, the

Table  2  illustrates  the  authorship  pattern  of  published  articles  in  foreign  LIS  journals.  Total  234  articles  have  been  contributed  by  467 authors. It is clear from the fgure that two- 
authored papers constitute maximum 97 articles  (41.45%)  followed  by  single-authored  papers  with  79  articles  (33.76  per  cent)  and  three- authored  papers  with  42  articles  (17.95  per  cent). Fewer articles (1.71 per cent) were written  by  fve  authors.  Further,  the  Collaborative  
Coeffcient (CC) as defned and formulated by  
Ajiferuke14, et al. indicates that the average CC  of total 234 articles is 0.38 which clearly shows  the trend towards joint authorship pattern among  the  authors  for  publishing  papers  in  foreign  journals. In 2006, the collaboration is decreased

affliated institutions, King Saud University collaborated with  Indian  authors  and  published  highest  3  articles  followed  by  University of Swaziland with 2 articles.  
5.7  Most preferred  Journals 
Table  6  lists  most  preferred  journals  of  Indian  authors  for publishing their research. Out of 33 foreign LIS journals,  Library Philosophy and Practice  has published maximum 62  articles followed by Scientometrics  with 25 articles,  Program with 20 articles and Electronic Library  with 19 articles. Out of  top 13 most preferred journals, 6 journals have impact factor  and Scientometric journal has been considered as the highest  impact factor journal with 2.084.  
5.8   r esearch area  wise distribution  of articles 
Indian authors contribute research publications in foreign  journals from the different sub-domains of LIS disciplines. It  is observed that majority of the articles 22.67% (56 articles)  were  published  in  the  area  of  ‘users’  study’  feld,  followed  by  ‘scientometrics/bibliometrics  studies’  with  45  articles  (18.22%) and ‘digital library and institutional repository’ with  19 articles (7.7%). It is also noted from the analysis of data  that very little research is published in the feld of ‘open source  software’, ‘Information Search/retrieval and Search Engine’,  ‘RFID’,  ‘school  library’  and  ‘special  library’.  Few  articles  have  been  written  in  current  topics,  such  as,  ‘webometric  analysis’,  ‘e-governance’,  and  ‘mobile  library  applications’.  A few articles come in the category of more than one subject

The  growth  of  Indian  LIS  literature  in  foreign  origin  journals has shown growth over the last 10 years. During the  period of 2006 to 2015, Indian authors contributed total 234  articles in 33 foreign LIS journals with an average 23 articles  per year. However, this may not be encouraging trend as this  is signifcantly less. Therefore, more attention is needed to be  given by the Indian authors to do research and publish quality  articles  in  foreign  LIS  journals.  The  average  collaborative  coeffcient  clearly  shows  the  dominance  of  joint  authors  in  research publications and authors from Delhi have contributed  maximum articles to foreign LIS journals. Library Philosophy  and  Practice,  the  USA  based  open  access  (OA)  journal  has  been discovered as the most preferred and infuential foreign  LIS journal among Indian authors. Further, among the research  focus  areas  for  Indian  authors,  majority  of  the  articles  are  published in the sub-domain of ‘Users’ Studies’ area, followed  by ‘Scientometrics/ bibliometrics Studies’. It is essential that  the Indian authors should give more attention and emphasis on

other innovative emerging research areas also.  
This study has also indicated less number of International  collaboration  with  fewer  numbers  of  countries  by  Indian  authors  in  LIS  discipline.  Hence  there  is  a  need  to  enhance  the  research  collaboration  with  LIS  scientists  from  different  countries.  This  move  is  bound  to  increase  the  collaborative  research output in the international arena.
