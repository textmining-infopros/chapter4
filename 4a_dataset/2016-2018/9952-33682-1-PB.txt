The purpose of this paper is to explore the Knowledge Sharing (KS) patterns among the students of the Arts  faculty, University of Dhaka (DU). In order to investigate the KS patterns, a structured questionnaire was used  which included different parameters such as background information of the respondents, their purpose, frequency,  preferred channels, benefts and motivators for Knowledge Sharing. The data were collected from a total number  of  372  students  and  later  analysed  using  SPSS  and  Microsoft  Excel. The  study  revealed  that,  majority  of  the  students of the Arts faculty share their knowledge for self-satisfaction. Although, largest numbers of the students  also believe knowledge sharing help them to create new knowledge and ideas, while, learning from each other is  
their prime motivator for KS.

1.  IntroDUctIon 
Knowledge  Sharing  (KS)  amongst  employees  in  organisations are widely recognised as an important aspect  for its potential towards developing the performance of the  organisations and its competitive advantages1. Therefore,  the  study  of  KS  is  dominated  by  those  focusing  on  KS  activity  within  the  business  organisations.  Obviously,  the  ultimate  goal  of  organisational  knowledge  sharing  in  these  institutions  is  profit-motivated.  However,  the  issue  of  KS  is  equally  important  for  a  knowledge- based institution, such as a University, where knowledge  production,  distribution  and  application  are  ingrained  in  the  institution.  It  is  also  very  import  to  mention  different  types  of  knowledge  which  can  be  shared2.  Knowledge  can  be  categorised  in  two  ways,  explicit  and  tacit.  ‘Explicit  knowledge’  is  easily  transferable  and codified into knowledge repository or an instruction  manual.  In  comparison,  ‘tacit  knowledge’  is  integrated  within  the  human  brain  and  this  type  of  knowledge  is  explained by Polyani3   as; ‘‘non-verbalised, intuitive and  unarticulated’’.  It  is  apparent  from  the  aforementioned  explanation that the latter type of knowledge is not fully  transferable.  However,  the  latter  is  considered  as  more  valuable4.  In  the  perspective  of  KS,  another  factor  that  is  leadership  or  managers  have  vital  roles.  Especially  the  attitudes,  behaviours  and  actions  of  the  leaders  or  managers  are  important.  Bircham-Connelly5,  et  al .  suggested that leadership plays a pivotal role in promoting  and  cultivating  KS  behaviour,  through  contributing  to  employee’s experiential learning, and through providing  opportunities  for  and  managing  the  processes  whereby  their  staff  share  or  transfer  their  knowledge.  Managers  also  have  a  hand  in  the  development  of  Information  
Technology  Systems,  reward  systems,  opportunities  for  interaction,  and  the  availability  of  time  for  KS6.  Organisational  structures  are  also  seen  as  impacting  significantly  on  KS7.  On  the  other  hand,  University  structures  invariably  differ  from  those  of  most  public  and commercial institutions. Tippins8  points out that the  functional  organisational  structure  of  higher  education  institutions  can  be  a  significant  barrier  to  KS,  as  can  physical and psychological barriers. However, academic  world has recognised the KS among university students as a  necessary and interesting area of study. As the organisations  are  emphasising  on  collaborative  work  increased,  the  curriculum  of  universities  is  also  structured  in  such  a  way  to  engage  students  in  collaborative  learning  which  lead them to reflect and learn more effectively. From the  view  of  positive  learning  outcomes  and  cognitive  gain,  it  is  proven  that  the  students  are  getting  benefitted  by  the  collaborative  learning.  Organisational  structures  are  also  seen  as  impacting  significantly  on  KS,  University  structures  invariably  differ  from  those  of  most  public  and  commercial  institutions. 
2.  LIterAtUre  revIew 
Researches relating to the Universities and KS mostly  emphasise  on  the  matter  that  the  working  atmosphere  of  the  Universities  is  different  from  other  Institutes  in  various  ways  and  the  picture  of  different  aspects  resulting  out  of  knowledge  management  (KM)  and  KS.  Towards  designing  the  KM  strategies  or  more  precisely  in pursuing to promote and facilitate the provision of KS,  accommodating  the  positive  environment  and  culture  in  the organisation has been identified as the main important  subject  matter  by  many  commentators9,10.

revealed that, initial overall benefits from the early stage  of  KS  among  female  students  of  Khulna  University  in  Bangladesh, were encouraging. The findings of that study  also showed that, the existing culture of KS and factors   of  KS,  do  not  depend  on  technology  alone.  In  addition  to that, that educational qualification is closely connected  with  the  purposes  of  KS.  In  another  study  Liebowitz,12  revealed  that,  existing  trend  of  the  organisation  should  be  appreciated  and  accommodated  for  every  initiated  KM plan. Specific characteristic of sharing of knowledge  has  been  discussed  by  plenty  of  commentators  in  their  range  of  research  articles.  However,  a  relatively  small  number  of  researches  have  been  performed  in  the  field  of  knowledge  sharing  itself  and  other  effective  factors  of  knowledge  sharing.  This  article  intends  to  make  a  contribution  towards  making  clear  understanding  of  KS  in  present  day’s  Universities  from  student’s  point  of  view  and  discussing  affecting  factors  of  KS. 
KS has been explained by Hansen13  as a process of  receiving and providing information, giving feedback after  experiencing  the  use  of  technology  and  product  by  the  staff.  KS  is  the  most  influential  factors  comparable  to  other knowledge related behaviours. KS is so important  in  academia  as  knowledge  creation,  integration  and  other  related  issues  are  directly  influenced  by  it. Tsai14 contented  that;  KS  should  be  identified  as  an  important  premise condition of knowledge creation. Issues concerning  individual factors, behavioural conditions, KS performance  and organisational routines came into the recent researches  done by various researchers. It is believed that, students  may achieve better learning capacity and more improved  thinking skills, when they work in groups with fellows15,16. Previous researches emphasised on intention, willingness  or propensity of an individual towards sharing knowledge  with  fellows.  This  is  because,  KS  is  still  assumed  as  voluntary  or  volitional.  
The  ideal  way  of  describing  the  KS  may  include  a  broad  range  of  characteristics  which  are  complex  and  multi-faceted. According to a significant number of research  papers, the most important factors of knowledge sharing  are  individual’s  values  and  attitudes  towards  KM,  trend  of  the  institution  and  characteristic  of  the  technology  that  shape  the  KS17-19.  However,  now  the  students  can  take  part  in  KS  activities  by  using  the  most  modern  and  fastest  growing Web  2.0  technologies;  features  like  Wikipedia, blogs, shared notes, etc., are widely available.  Through the use of these technologies, students are able  to  publish  digital  contents  by  exchanging,  collecting  and seeking various ideas20-22.  In  order  to  have  the  best  result  out  of  this  latest  technology,  the  willingness  of  sharing  Knowledge  with  other  community  and  groups  is  very  vital.  
Sometimes students tend to get confused by Knowledge  and  Information  Sharing.  There  is  a  clear  distinction  between  knowledge  and  information  sharing,  because  the  KS  carries  idea,  principle  and  purpose  beyond  the  sphere  of  mere  sharing.  The  ideas  of  working  together,  
244 
collaborating  with  others  and  helping  each  other  fall  in  KS.  Whereas,  information  sharing  mostly  demonstrates  the  idea  of  giving  and  taking  something  from  one  to  another  person.  KS,  therefore,  creates  a  new  process  of  learning.  Another  important  factors  of  the  category  knowledge,  which  also  influences  the  KS  behaviour3.  There  are  some  differences  between  tacit  and  explicit  knowledge.  According  to  Nonaka  &  Takeuchi23,  tacit  knowledge  is  seen  to  be  hard  to  share  or  interact  with  others. The tacit knowledge includes intuitions, subjective  insights and hunches kind of things. On the other hand,  explicit knowledge is codified in a formal form through  a  systematic  way  through  the  use  of  symbols  or  might  have  a  physical  artifact  and  can  be  shared  easily.  
It  is  apparent  from  the  previous  studies  purported  on the area of social capital and social cognitive theory  that  individuals’  willingness  to  share  knowledge  is  influenced  by  several  factors25-30.  Chou24   and  Chiu31,  et  al. argued  that  KS  behaviour  is  generally  guided  by  major  cognitive  forces  like  self-efficacy  and  outcome  expectations. Therefore, previous studies proposed to take  such approaches which increase the individual contribution  through KS behaviour32. According  to  the  social  capital  theory,  individuals’  intention  to  share  knowledge  might  be greatly influenced by the perception of trust, in more  clear term; they believe from the reliability point of view  that  sharing  contexts  are  somehow  worthy28,25,29.  It  can  be  said  from  the  above  mentioned  assertion  that,  the  students are only willing to share knowledge after giving  due  concern  whether  others  will  take  benefit  out  of  the  content  or  misuse  it.  Moreover,  some  previous  studies  showed that the willingness of sharing knowledge depends  upon  that  person’s  perception  of  information  resources  and the knowledge of different context rather than gaining  any immediate reward or feedback33. Roknuzzaman34   in  his  study  found  that,  the  users  of  the  Dhaka  university  library possessed positive perception and attitude towards  the concept of KS. They shared various knowledge related  to  their  study,  current  issues,  including  social,  political  and  cultural  affairs.

4.  MethoDoLogy 
The respondents in this study were both undergraduate  (B.A.  (Hons))  and  postgraduate  (M.A.)  students  at Arts  Faculty,  University  of  Dhaka.  Currently  there  are  17  Departments under Arts faculty and all the department’s  students  were  brought  under  the  survey. A  total  number  of 400 printed questionnaires were distributed randomly  among  the  students  to  reveal  their  knowledge  sharing  practices,  of  these,  372(93%)  completed  questionnaires  were returned and later included for analysis. Finally, the  data collected through the questionnaires were processed  and  analysed  by  using  SPSS.  The  major  limitation  of  this  study  is  the  sample  of  the  population,  which  might  not  be  representative,  as  only  the Arts  faculty  student’s  participated  in  the  study.  Therefore,  the  findings  would  not be used for generalising the greater context of Dhaka  University students. However the findings may still provide  a thoughtful insight as an exploratory study. In addition  to  that,  faculty  and  researcher  were  excluded  from  the  study as the researchers wanted a deep insight from the  students  only  regarding  the  topic  and  hopefully  future  researchers  will  include  the  faculty  and  researchers  as  well in their study. To make the study more suitable and  understandable for the students, the researchers preferred  to  include  more  common  variables  in  the  questionnaire  and  avoided  complex  topics  and  variables.

Respondents  were  also  asked  to  make  comments  about  their  thought  show  sharing  of  knowledge  might  benefit  them.  In  that  case,  71.5%  believe  that,  KS  help  them  create    new  knowledge  and  ideas.  While,  26.3%  of  them  were  only  satisfied  to  share  knowledge  with  others  on  different  subjects  and  very  few  respondents  (2.2%)  replied  that  it  might  improve  their  grades  in  the  examinations  (Table  6).

students  reported  that  self-satisfaction  is  their  way  of  motivators.  On  the  other  hand,  only  9.68%  find  their  motivators  by  helping  others.  
5.8.  Frequency  of  Using  It   Facilities  to  Share  
Knowledge 
There  were  seven  statements  given  to  measure  the  frequency of using IT facilities to share knowledge. For  each statement responses was coded 1 for very rarely to 5  for more frequently. The findings suggest that, IT was used  very rarely, i.e., 89.1- 90.1% of the respondents. While more  than 5% used webpage rarely, 3.5% used the E-document  management  system,  5.9%  used  the  Chat  room  more  frequently. These  responses  are  reflected  in  table  8. 
5.9.  Problems  to  Share  Knowledge  with others 
The  respondents  were  asked  to  indicate  possible  reasons that leads to less sharing knowledge. Among the  students, 43.27% replied that poor sharing of knowledge in  the organisation is the major problem to share knowledge  with  others.  While,  34.13%  of  the  respondents  exposed  that,  lack  of  information  regarding  KS;  loss  of  crucial  knowledge due to a key employee leaving the organisation  was  another  reason  to  share  knowledge  with  others,  which  was  pointed  out  by  11.3%  of  the  respondent.  While  only  5.1%  and  6.2%  reported  that  re-inventing  the  wheel  and  information  overload  is  the  reluctance  to  share  knowledge.

6.  DIScUSSIonS     
The results of the study revealed that the majority of  the  students  share  their  knowledge  for  self-satisfaction.  The  study  also  showed  that  KS  can  help  to  solve  their  problems,  though  a  few  of  them  think  otherwise.  It  is  clearly  visible  from  the  study  that  almost  a  quarter  of  the respondents use social networks for sharing of their  knowledge and more than half of them share knowledge  through  group  discussions.  In  case  of  the  frequency  of  using  Knowledge  sources,  the  highest  number  of  the  students’ uses those knowledge sources every day, while,  a  significant  percentage  use  those  sources  occasionally.  Respondents were also asked to make comments about their  thoughts  regarding  the  potential  benefits  of  Knowledge  sharing.  Among  the  respondents,  near  about  one-third  believe KS can help them to create new knowledge and  ideas  and  almost  the  remaining  portion  only  satisfy  to  share  knowledge  with  others  on  different  subjects.  The  present  research  found  that  to  learn  from  each  other  is  one  of  the  prime  motivators  of  KS.  It  is  alarming  that  in  the  age  of  Information  Technology  (IT),  the  largest  portion  of  the  respondents  use  IT  very  rarely  during  information sharing. The study also pointed out that poor  sharing  of  knowledge  in  the  organisation  is  the  major  problems  to  share  knowledge  with  others. 
7.    concLUSIonS 
Positive attitude towards KS creates beneficial ambiance  at  tertiary  education  level  and  builds  a  strong  basis  for  students to serve their organisations in a better way when  they  join  the  workforce  after  graduation.  The  barriers  must be eradicated so that KS works in the organisations  can  be  done  easily. This  is  because  obstacles  can  affect  adversely  the  awareness  towards  KS.  The  university  authority can promote KS by appreciating the benefits and  motivators  of  KS.  The  university  administrators  should  take  attempt  to  inspire  KS  among  the  students.  At  the  same  time,  the  motivators  identified  in  this  study  shall  serve  as  a  guide  to  the  university  administrators.  The  other  important  aspect  is  the  students  themselves.  They  must  realise  that  KS  activities  bring  many  benefits  to  them. KS among students will significantly enhance group  communications,  problem-solving,  and  decision  making  skills,  which  support  the  students.  They  must  realise  that  the  university  is  increasingly  becoming  learning  organisations,  and  thus  increasing  sharing  habit  adds  value  to  the  students  as  they  join  the  workforce  later.
