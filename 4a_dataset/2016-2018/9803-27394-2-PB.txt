ABSTRACT 
This study investigates the existing library and information services, facilities and support available for the  visually-impaired and blind students at the University of Khartoum in Sudan.It also highlighted the specifc diffculties  faced by these students in satisfying their information needs. The study sample consisted of 20 subjects out of a  total population of 45 visually-impaired and blind students, constituting 44.44 % of the study population.  Literature  review was also used to collect data about some aspects of the study topic, such as the different types of technologies  available for enabling the visually-impaired and blind to beneft from library services. The study revealed that the  services and facilities available at the University of Khartoum are inadequate. A number of recommendations that  are expected to  improve the situation are suggested, including the need of the visually impaired and blind students   for more training on using the available assistive technologies.  
Keywords: Library services, visually-impaired, assistive technologies, tactile tools, braille books 
1.  InTRodUCTIon 
The  term  ‘special  needs’  in  the  context  of  library  services relates to the needs of people who cannot make  use  of  conventional  libraries  and  library  materials  and  services.  Bhattacharya  &  Roy1 outlined  four  categories  of  people  with  special  needs  which  include-mobility  impairments;  blindness;  low  vision;  hearing  or  speech  impairments and specific learning disabilities. The visually-  impaired and blind people constitute an important segment  of  the  society  all  over  the  world.  Hence,  they  should  have  access  to  knowledge  and  information  on  an  equal  basis  with  the  other  segments  of  the  society. According  to  the World  Health  Organisation2,  there  are  about  285  million visually-impaired people worldwide, out of which  39  million  are  blind  and  246  with  low  vision.  These  statistics also indicate that 90 % of the world`s visually-  impaired  population  live  in  developing  countries.  
1.1  Library  and  Information  Services  for  Visually-  
impaired  in  University  of  Khartoum 
The  higher  education  scene  in  Sudan  has  changed  dramatically during the last two and a half decades. More  and  more  new  government  and  private  universities  and  colleges  were  established  throughout  the  country.  The  intake of students to the already existing universities has  also highly increased, including intake by the oldest and  largest university in the country, the University of Khartoum  
(UofK).  This  change  was  started  in  the  year  1990  with  what was called then the ‘Higher Education Revolution’  and  continued  throughout  the  last  two  and  a  half  or  so  decades. The increase in the number of higher education  institutions and students intake was also accompanied by  the introduction of new academic programmes and modes  of higher education, such as undergraduate diplomas and  distance  learning  programmes.  This  change  in  higher  education  policy  resulted  in  enabling  a  large  number  of  students,  including  students  with  special  needs,  to  join  the  higher  education  institutions.  At  the  University  of  Khartoum, there has been a steady increase in the number  of  visually-impaired  and  blind  students,  particularly  in  the humanities and social sciences faculties and schools.  This  necessitated  the  provision  of  suitable  information  resources  and  services  that  would  cater  for  the  special  needs  of  this  segment  of  the  student  population. 1.2 Assistive  Technologies  for  the  Visually-impaired  
and  the  Blind 
Due to their special physical situation, the visually- impaired and blind people need some special requirements  to fulfil their need for information and knowledge. This  has  been  facilitated  by  the  current  advances  in  ICT.

assistive  technology;  all  technology  is  assisting  humans  in their life. However, in health care the term ‘assistive  technology’  has  often  a  special  meaning.  They  point  out  that  assistive  technology  devices  enable  individuals  with disabilities to participate in society as contributing  members. 
The American Foundation for the Blind (AFB)4 lists  a number of technologies which are designed specifically  to  help  people  with  vision  loss  or  other  disabilities.  These  include  the  following  broad  categories: (i)  Screen  readers  for  blind  individuals  
These  are  software  programmes  that  allow  blind  or  visually-impaired  people  to  read  texts  displayed  on  the  screen  with  a  speech  synthesizer.  It  is  the  interface  between the computer`s operating system, its applications,  and the user. The IFLA Library Services to people with  Special  Needs  Section5   defines  a  screen  reader  as:  ‘A  software  application  that  identifies  and  interprets  what  is  displayed  on  a  screen  and  then  represents  it  through  text-to-speech,  sound  icons,  or  a  Braille  output  device.  Screen  readers  are  potentially  helpful  for  people  with  visual  limitations,  people  who  are  illiterate,  or  people  with learning disabilities’. Screen readers are the primary  way  by  which  visually-impaired  people  can  access  the  internet  as  noted  by Williamson  &  Schauder6. (ii) Screen  magnifiers  for  low-vision  computer  users 
These  enlarge  texts  and  graphics  on  a  computer  screen.  A  screen  magnification  system  is  loaded  into  the  computer`s  memory  and  functions  similarly  to  a  magnifying  glass  moving  over  a  page,  following  the  cursor  and  magnifying  the  area  around  it. 
1.2.2 Tactile  Tools 
There are also a number of tactile tools for reading  print.  These  tools  mainly  utilise  the  Braille  system  which is considered to be the primary means of reading  print  for  the  visually-impaired.  It  is  a  system  of  raised  dots  arranged  in  a  specific  pattern.  These  include  the  following: 
(i)  Braille books—Braille books are appropriate for users  
who  have  both  visual  and  hearing  impairment. (ii)  Large printed materials—these are documents printed  
in  large  fonts  for  use  by  partially  sighted  users. (iii) Braille translation software, and Braille embossers—  
Braille  translation  software  is  a  programme  that  
converts  print  material  in  electronic  format  into  
Braille. These programmes must be used with a braille  
embosser  to  produce  material  in  hard  copy  braille.  
The  braille  embosser  is  a  device  that  resembles  a  
printer and which produces materials in braille instead  
of  in  ink  as  in  the  case  with  the  printer.  
1.2.3 Auditory  Tools 
Babalola & Yacob 
7 listed a number of auditory tools  for  reading  printed  material,  these  include: 
94 
(a)  Talking books-these are audio versions of books that  
could be recorded on cassettes, CD-ROM, DVD and  
on  the  internet  as  e-books.  
(b)  Talking newspapers- audio recordings of news articles  
in  the  dailies. 
According to Getz8,  talking  books  are  preferred  by  the  majority  of  the  visually-impaired  and  the  blind.  
2.  LITeRATURe  ReVIew 
Library  services  available  worldwide  for  the  visually-impaired  are  inadequate.The  IFLA  Declaration  of Fundamental Rights to Access and Express Information9 states that library services for the visually-impaired and  the  blind  even  in  relatively  developed  and  prosperous  countries  are  under  developed  compared  to  public  libraries,  and  that  most  provide  less  than  5  %  of  the  materials  published  in  their  countries.  Pillai10   suggests  that Indian universities should establish a learning centre  for  the  blind  and  visually-impaired  with  all  facilities  such  as  assistive  technologies,  online  materials  and  audio  studios.  Koganuramath  &  Choukimath11   further  outline the purposes of such learning centre in India as: (a) To provide ‘Equity of Access’ to the visually-impaired  students;  (b)  To  improve  the  ‘access  audit’  of  national  higher  education  system;  (c)  To  provide  access  to  the  academic information sources; (d) To explore the views of  constituent universities about ‘disability information services’;  (e) To explore the utiliation of ‘Assistive Technologies’  and; (f) To train the library staff in providing information  services  to  the  visually-challenged  students. 
Ajobiewe12   comments  on  library  services  for  the  visually-impaired  in  Nigeria  and  states  that  it  is  quite  evident  that  a  few  institutions  scattered  throughout  Nigeria produce reading and information materials for the  visually-handicapped  students.  He  further  indicates  that  these services are mainly for the visually-handicapped in  schools  and  few  adults  who  become  blind  later  in  life.  
3. oBjeCTIVeS 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
(a)  Highlight  the  technologies  and  facilities  available  
for  providing  visually-impaired  and  blind  students  
with  their  information  needs 
(b) Investigate existing library and information services  
for  the  visually-impaired  students  at  the  University  
of  Khartoum 
(c)  Highlight  the  difficulties  faced  by  visually-impaired  
and  blind  students  at  the  University  of  Khartoum  
in  using  the  library  to  satisfy  their  information  
needs.

was  done  with  those  working  at  the  library  which  was  devoted  to  the  visually-impaired  and  blind  students  at  the  University  of  Khartoum,  and  the  other  one  with  a  sample  of  these  students  to  investigate  their  opinion  of  the  information  services  they  are  provided  with.  The  students  sample  consisted  of  20  subjects  out  of  a  total  population  of  45  visually-impaired  and  blind  students,  constituting 44.44 % of the study population. Literature  review  is  also  used  to  collect  data  about  some  aspects  of  the  study  topic. 
5.  dATA  An ALySIS And  dISCUSSIonS 
Library services for visually-impaired students at the  University of Khartoum were established in 2003 by the  inauguration  of  the  “Audio  Library”.  This  library  was  initially supported by the Deanship of Students who led  the initiative for establishing a library dedicated for the  visually-impaired and blind students at the University of  Khartoum.  The  library  consists  of  two  separate  rooms  one is used as a listening room equipped with a number  of  tape  recorders,  whereas  the  second  room  is  used  as  a  computer  laboratory  equipped  with  computers  loaded  with  some  assistive  technologies.  There  are  three  staff  members  working  at  the  Audio  Library.  The  Librarian  who holds a Master’s degree in Library and Information  Science (MLIS); an Assistant Librarian with a Postgraduate  Diploma  in  LIS,  and  a  Library Attendant  with  a  School  Leaving  Certificate. 
The  total  number  of  visually-impaired  and  blind  students at the University is currently 45 students, enrolled  mainly in the social sciences and humanities faculties and  schools. Table 1 shows distribution of visually-impaired  students  across  the  University  of  Khartoum.

5.2  Library  Services offered  
The  Audio  Library  of  the  University  of  Khartoum  provides  the  following  services  and  facilities  to  the  visually-impaired  and  blind  students  of  the  university:  • Listening  to  audio  tape  cassettes  which  consist  
mainly  of  recorded  academic  material; 
• Reading  of  books  and  journals  written  in  Braille; • Copying  of  cassettes  and  disks; 
• Recording  of  written  lectures  notes;  this  activity  is  
carried  out  by  volunteers; 
• Conducting  of  training  courses  in  computer  skills

• Browsing  the  internet  via  the  Ibsar  screen  reader  
programme; 
• Borrowing services, mainly of cassettes and material  
written  in  Braille. 
5.3  Mode  of Access  to  Library  Services  and  
Facilities 
Students were asked about how they have access the  library  materials  and  facilities.  Most  of  them  conveyed  that  they  do  so  by  the  assistance  of  the  library  staff  as  illustrated  by Table  3. 
The  vitually-impaired  students  at  the  University  of  Khartoum  are  in  need  of  more  training  on  how  to  use  the  library  facilities  by  themselves.
