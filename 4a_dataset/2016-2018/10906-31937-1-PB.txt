1.      INTRODUCTION 
Since  the  mid-1990s  has  emerged  a  new  research  field, webometrics, investigating the nature and properties  of the Web drawing on modern infometric methodologies.  The World Wide Web (WWW) has become a major source  of  information  for  research  and  academic  activities.  Hence, is the best platform to investigate new methods of  evaluating webometric activities. In the face of a growing  demand for education and fundamental changes in higher  education in most countries, the increasing value gets the  creative  coordination  of  world  universities  on  the  basis  of a constant exchange of experience between them. The  easiest and the effective way to operational exchange of  information  is  publication  on  the  website.  Enhancing  a  web policy expands the dialogue between the universities,  contributes  to  the  formation  of  new  communications  in  the  scientific  community,  and  helps  the  realisation  of

innovative development. This would shed some light on  the  use  of  key  communication  medium  and  could  lead  to  more  effective  academic  use  of  the  web.  
Bojorneborne1   defined  webometrics  as:  ‘the  study  of  the  quantitative  aspects  of  the  construction  and  use  of  information  resources,  structures  and  technologies  on  the  web,  drawing  on  bibliometric  and  informetric  approaches’. This definition covers the construction side  and usage side of the web, which embrace the following  four  main  areas  of  webometrics  study:  
(a) Web-page  content  analysis  
(b) Weblink structure analysis (e.g., hyperlink, self-link  
and  external  link)  
(c) Web  usage  analysis  (e.g.,  exploiting  log  files  for  
users  searching  and  browsing  behaviour),  and  (d) Web  technology  analysis  (including  search  engine  
performance).

CENTRAL  UNIVERSITIES  OF  NORTH  EASTERN  STATES  OF  INDIA 
This study examined the websites of these 10 Central  Universities (Table 1) of 8 different states of North East  in  India  which  listed.  This  study  makes  a  webometric  analysis of central universities’ websites in North Eastern  States  of  India.  There  are  47  central  universities  in  India,  out  of  this,  10  Central  Universities  are  from  8  different  states  of  Northeast  in  India. The  present  study  aimed at to build academic ranking of these websites by  calculating their Web Impact Factor (WIF). The ranking  of these websites will enable the readers to identify and  compare the Central Universities websites in North East  India  by  their  WIF.

LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Jalal, Biswas & Mukhopadhyay2  studied the Web impact  factor and link analysis of selected Indian universities and  has found that NIT Durgapur, NIT Allahabad, NIT Calicut,  NIT Surathkal and NIT Trichi are producing maximum links.  Delhi  University,  Banaras  Hindu  University,  Jawaharlal  Nehru University, Aligarh Muslim University are having  maximum  in-links  and  are  connected  with  each  other.  Jeyshankar & Babu3  examined and explored the websites  of 45 universities in Tamil Nadu comprising of 27 state  and  18  private  universities.  They  have  identified  the  domain systems, analysed the number of web pages, link  page, and calculated self-link web impact factor, simple  web  impact  factor  (SWIF),  external  web  impact  factor  (EWIF)  of  the  universities  websites  in  Tamil  Nadu  and  ranked the websites according to their WIF. Lee & Teh4    have  evaluated  the  design  and  content  of  12  academic  library  websites  of  public  and  private  institutions  of  higher  learning  in  Malaysia  and  uses  a  mixed-method  approach that combines both quantitative and qualitative  analyses  of  academic  library Websites  evaluation. Their  findings observed that the academic libraries in Malaysia  have generally set up well designed and useful websites.  Only  a  few  academic  library  websites,  found  to  have  very  simple  and  basic  features.  
Madhusudhan & Prakash5  made a webometric study  on websites of Indian Institute of Technology. The study  explored  different  characteristics  of  linking  analysis  of  sixteen  IIT  websites.  The  IIT  Bombay  and  IIT  Madras  secured 1st  position and 2 
nd 
 position respectively in WIF  (in-link) as well as in world rank; whereas, WIF (in-link)  position of IIT Rajasthan shows one position better rank  than  the  world  ranking,  i.e.,  15th   position.  Maharana,  Panda  &  Sahoo6   has  conducted  a  webometric  study  on  16 IITs of India. They have analysed the number of web  pages  and  link  pages,  identifies  the  domain  systems  of  the  websites,  calculates  the  self-link  web  impact  factor,  simple  web  impact  factor  (SWIF),  and  external  web  impact  factor  (EWIF)  of  IITs  in  India.  The  study  also  reflects  that  some  of  the  IITs  have  higher  number  of  web  pages,  but  correspondingly  with  small  number  of  
link  pages  and  the  websites  fall  behind  in  their  self- link,  simple  and  external  link  WIF.  Verma  &  Brahma7  conducted  a  study  on  webometric  analysis  of  selected  non-profit organisations (NGOs) of Assam and has found  that Centre for North East Studies and Policy Research,  Guwahati and AARANYAK is at the top rank among the  selected  NGOs  websites  in Assam. 
4.  OBJECTIVES 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  as  follows: 
(a) Analyse the domains of central universities websites  
of  North  East  India 
(b) Calculate  the  number  of  web  pages  of  central  
universities  websites  of  North  East  India (c) Examine  the  link-equity  in  websites  of  Central  
universities  of  North  East  India  under  study (d) Find out internal and external link pages of websites  
of  central  universities  of  North  East  India.  under  
study 
(e) Calculate the web impact factor of Central Universities  
websites  of  North  East  India. 
5.    METHODOLOGY 
For  the  present  study,  data  were  collected  from  the  websites  of  Central  Universities  in  North  East  India  during 5-10 October 2016. The study identified Websites  of  10  Central  Universities  in  North  East  India.  This  study  used  open  site  explorer  (www.opensiteexplorer. org)  and  website  optimisation  for  collecting  raw  data.  While  measuring  the  WIF,  it  is  important  to  select  a  suitable  search  engine  which  will  count  the  number  of  pages  in  website  and  number  of  pages  linking  to  the  websites. Open site explorer is an optimisation tool and  search  engine  for  links.  It  makes  gathering,  and  sorting  and  exporting  link  data  easier  than  ever.  It  provides  a  tremendous  amount  of  information  about  the  links  to  any  page  or  site.    
6.  WEB  IMPACT  FACTOR 
The Web Impact Factor (WIF) is a form of measurement  used  to  determine  the  relative  standing  of  websites  in  particular  fields  or  a  country;  for  instance,  academic  websites  in  a  country. The  higher  the  impact  factor,  the  higher the perceived reputation of the website. WIFs are  the  part  of  the  methodology  of  webometrics. 
The  Web  Impact  Factor  provides  quantitative  tools  for,  evaluating,  categorising,  ranking  and  comparing  websites,  top  level  domains  and  sub-domains. 
The  three  types  of  links  are: 
(a) The Simple WIF, which means the ratio of all links  
to  the  number  of  pages 
(b) The Internal WIF, which means the ratio of internal  
links  within  the  site  to  number  of  pages

DJLIT, VOL.  37,  NO.  3, MAY   2017 
(c) The  External  WIF,  which  means  the  ratio  of  links  
made  from  external  sites  to  the  target  site,  to  the  
number  of  pages  at  the  site 
Distribution  of  Data  by  SWIF  has  been  calculated  by  the  following  formula: 
          ( Total number of links) SWIF =  ----------------------------------- 
           ( Total number of webpages) 
Distribution  of  Data  by  IWIF  has  been  Calculated  by  the  Following  Formula: 
           ( Total number of internal links) IWIF =  ----------------------------------------- 
           ( Total number of webpages) 
Distribution  of  Data  by  EWIF  has  been  calculated  by  the  Following  Formula:

9.  CONCLUSIONS 
This study gives a basic idea and information about  the  websites  of  10  Central  Universities  of  North  East  India. The  study  aimed  at  to  build  academic  ranking  of  these  websites  by  calculating  their  Web  Impact  Factor  (WIF).  The  ranking  of  these  websites  will  enable  the  readers to identify and compare the Central Universities  websites  in  North  East  India  by  their  WIF.  From  the  above  findings  it  is  concluded  that  Mizoram  University  (MZU)  with  its  highest  WIF  gained  the  top  profile  among  the  Central  Universities  Websites  in  North  East  India.  Whereas  NEHU,  Tezpur  University  and  Rajiv  Gandhi  University  are  also  in  the  path  of  good  ranked.  It  was  observed  that  Central  Agricultural  University,  Nagaland  University  and  Tripura  University  websites  has  got  the  least  number  of  Domain  Authority  which  indicates  their  low  rank  on  search  engines.  Its  needs  to  improve the website for the ranking of entire domains or  subdomains and to enable the users to find their relevant  information in quickest possible time and same line, the  Page Authority of some universities websites also needs  to  be  improve  to  get  the  ranking  of  higher  page  score.  The  six  central  universities  of  Northeast  India  (Assam  University,  Manipur  University,  Central  Agricultural  
University,  Nagaland  University,  Sikkim  University  and  Tripura University) are having zero Internal Equity-Passing  Links and the two universities (i.e., Central Agricultural  University  and  Nagaland  University)  have  got  the  least  External  Equity-Passing  Links.  Central  Agricultural  University,  Nagaland  University,  Sikkim  University  and  Tripura  University  are  having  less  number  of  Total  links, which indicates that the total amount of links site  (all  types  of  links)  are  poor  and  needs  improvement  to  stay connected with each other. The overall Web Impact  Factor  of  all  central  universities  of  Northeast  India  is  found low and is needed to improve for better visibility  and  accessibility.
