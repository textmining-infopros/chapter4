The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the digital reading competency of the students in universities  in Kerala. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from a representative sample of 525 students of the  teaching departments of three prominent universities in Kerala. The fndings revealed that a good number of the  students have a medium level of digital reading competency. It is also noted that male students exhibited a high  level of competency as compared with female students and also that there exists a signifcant relationship between  digital reading competency and level of competency to use computer and other digital devices. This study will be  useful to develop digital literacy education framework which will enhance student’s digital reading competency.

1.  INtRODUCtION 
Information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  has  opened new horizons for the creation, storage and dissemination  of information. The pace at which information sources are being  produced  and  converted  into  electronic  form  is  marvelous.  Information from e-resources cannot be accessed and read in  the same manner as printed sources were consulted previously.  Suffcient knowledge about computers and retrieval techniques  are desirable to effectively search and read e-resources. 
In the digital environment, many individuals lean toward  digital texts to printed ones, and have subsequently given rise  to a type of reading, called on-screen reading1. To understand  the on-screen reading, it is important to inspect the components  of the process and to re-conceptualise the concept of reader- text-author2. On screen reading differs in contrast with reading  printed text in terms of skills and process3. Other than those  paper  reading  abilities,  formulating  keywords,  assessing  relationships between hyperlinks, choosing high-quality texts  from online texts, incorporating hypertexts within open textual  boundaries, and retrieving particular facts from Websites were  identifed  as  new  skills  for  digital  reading4.  Technological  advancement  have  in  this  manner  created  new  opportunities  as well as posed new diffculties and challenges for individuals  forcing  them  to  acquire  new  skills  to  beneft  from  these  advancements5. 
Warschauer and Healey6 take note of that in a world of  information, search strategies are essential and a student need  ‘the ability to react and adapt to changes instead of training in  a single way to approach a task’. Students need to build up the  ability to fnd information in plenty of hypertexts, evaluates its

credibility, and decide whether to accept the information, or  continue searching for more relevant information. Furthermore,  the increasing utilisation of digital libraries is promoting digital  reading and forcing students to move beyond the domain of  paper-based texts7-9. Bruce10 develops this point by contending  that with the proliferation of information needed for scholarly  purposes, students are exposed not only to conventional text  presentation but also to electronic texts. The main challenge for  students is to acquire the digital literacy skills that will allow  him/her  entrance  into  the  social,  academic,  and  workforce  environments of the 21st  century

It is essential to deepen the knowledge about factors and  process  that  can  support  or  hinder  hypertext  comprehension  and  how  to  prepare  students  to  deal  suitably  with  digital  information. Students who possess higher education and digital  literacy skills will doubtlessly have the ability to retrieve and  read  more  pertinent  and  valuable  information,  which  will  then  be  translated  into  academic,  commercial,  political  and  social focal points. This study investigates the digital reading  competency of students in the universities in Kerala.  
2.  LItERAtURE  REVIEW 
Several research communities have started to explore the  changes to literacy created by new technologies and the social  practices  they  induce.  Coiro12   viewed  this  new  literacy’s  as  vital new strategies and dispositions, required by the Internet,  that  are  fundamental  for  online  reading  comprehension,  learning,  and  communication.  McPherson13  trust  that  the  Internet  or  computer-based  learning  activities  make  reading  more  enjoyable.  Such  activities  likewise  motivate  students  to become active participants, encourage them to use critical  reading  skills,  and  improve  students’  reading  fuency  and  understanding  of  content.  McNabb14, et  al., also  pointed  out  

========1========

DIVyA  & M OHAMED: DIgITAL  R EADINg COMPETENCy OF  S TUDENTS: A STUDy IN  U NIVERSITIES IN  K ERALA 
that higher order literacy skills, such as organising, comparing,  contrasting, and synthesising information, are crucial factors  when students complete Internet-based activities.  
As Murphy15, et al.,  have expressed, the techniques and  strategies  requisite  for  comprehending  traditional  printed  text  are  not  the  same  strategies  required  to  comprehend  computerised  texts.  According  to  Coiro16,  et  al.,   what  it  means to be literate has evolved from having the competence  to  access,  evaluate  and  understand  static  printed  texts  to  being able to access, fnd, evaluate, understand and utilise a  dynamically rich variety of digital texts accessible through  the  Internet. Adeleke  &  Emehara17 reported  that  less  usage  of  e-resources  is  associated  with  the  lack  of  searching  skills  and  also  there  exists  a  signifcant  relation  between  the  use  of  e-resources  and  digital  literacy  skills.  Leu18, et  al.,   found  no  signifcant  correlation,  among  seventh-grade  students,  between  performance  on  a  measure  of  offine  reading  comprehension  and  a  measure  of  online  reading  comprehension for adolescents.  
Shen19 reveal  that  English  as  Foreign  Language  college  students reading habits has changed from paper-based to Web- based reading. Shariman20, et al.,reported that the Malaysian  students’  digital  literacy  competency  depended  on  several  factors  like  English  language  profciency,  and  the  design  of  multimodal  forms  in  digital  contents.  Pattuelli  &  Rabina21  found  that  the  portability  of  the  device  and  its  convenience  of  use  anywhere  and  anytime  are  pivotal  for  enhancing  the  students reading experience.  
3.  MEtHODOLOGY 
The  statistical  population  comprises  the  post  graduate  students of the University of Kerala, University of Calicut and  Mahatma gandhi  University.  The  aggregate  number  of  post  graduate students in the teaching departments of the universities  was 3300. A representative sample of 525 students was selected  with stratifed random sampling. Structured questionnaire was  the  main  instrument  for  data  collection.  The  questionnaire  was pre-tested before fnal application. Out of 525 copies of  questionnaire  distributed,  a  total  of  426  questionnaires  were  returned back with a response rate of 81 per cent. Among the  respondents, 217 students were male and the remaining 209  were female students. Data collected were coded and analysed  with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.  Simple percentages, Mean, Standard Deviation and Chi-square  tests, Correlation and Mann-Whitney U tests were employed  for analysing the data and testing hypotheses. 
4.  RESULtS AND  DISCUSSIONS 
4.1  Experience  of  Use  of  Computer  
Chauhan  &  Lal22   emphasised  that  new  technologies  not  only  infuence  students  learning  and  studying  in  the  classroom,  but  also  affect  their  reading  behaviours.  Skilled  and experienced students have knowledge about the structures  and  functionalities  in  computer  environment  that  helped  in  locating, accessing, and managing information while reading  online. The students were asked to indicate their experience of  use of computer and the responses are presented in Table 1.

By analysing the results, it is clearly seen that a sum total  of  147  students  (male,  33.6,  female,  35.4)  have  a  computer  experience of 4-6 years and around 32 per cent of both genders  have an experience of 1-3 years. At the same time about 14.3  per cent of university students have a good experience of use of  computer, i.e. 7-9 years and also more than 9 years. To test the  signifcance of variable comprising male and female students in  their experience of use of computer Chi-square test conducted  and found that there is no signifcant association among them.  Substantiating these results, Sacks23, et al.  in a study of high  school students found that their attitudes towards computer and  their use of computer tended to vary by gender. This difference  however tended to diminish with computer experience.  
4.2 Competency  in  Computer  and  Other  Digital  
Devices 
Unlike  traditional  text  forms  which  commonly  include  a  blend  of  two  sorts  of  media,  print  and  two  dimensional  graphics, digital text integrate a range of symbols and multi- media  formats  including  icons,  animated  symbols,  audio,  interactive tables, virtual reality environments and many more3.  Computer and other digital devices assume a noteworthy role  in  the  way  readers  are  reading  around  the  world  and  serve  perhaps as the most comprehensive source of input24. Adequate  knowledge and skills about computer and other digital devices  are desirable to effectively search these electronic information  sources. Table 2 illustrates the student’s level of competency in  the computer and other digital devices. 
Results  clearly  revealed  that  nearly  50  per  cent  of  the  students have very high competency to use mobile phone. In  the mean time more than 40 per cent of them reported a high  level of competency in devices like desktop computer, laptop  computer and mobile phone. goldhammer25, et al.found strong  positive  relations  between  fundamental  computer  skills  and  online reading for the German sample of the PISA 2009 feld  test.  Basic  computer  skills  accounted  for  38  per  cent  of  the  variance in digital reading.  
A score for level of expertise in use of digital devices is  calculated by adding the scores of level of expertise to each  digital  device.  For  each  device,  a  score  of  0,  1,  2,  3,  and  4  were given to the response very low, low, moderate, high and  very high respectively. As there are 10 devices total score of  expertise  ranges  in  between  0  to  40. This  expected  range  is  divided  into  three  groups.  Low  level  with  scores  ranges  in

between 0 to 12, medium level with scores ranges in between  13 to 26 and high level with scores ranges in between 27 to  40. Classifcation according to the level of expertise is given  below in Table 3, shows that majority of the students have a  medium level of competency in the use of computer and other  digital devices. 
Gender has turned into a signifcant issue related with the  use of computer and other advanced gadgets. As per the results  depicted  in  Table  3,  approximately  77.5  per  cent  of  female  students and 65 per cent of male students reported that they  have medium level of competency to use computer and other  digital devices. A high level of competency is reported by 32.7  per cent of the male students, and only a few per cent (6.7) of  female students have reported the same. Substantiating these  results, Campbell26  and Shashaani 
27 
 claimed that compared to  female students, male students had more access to computers,  felt more confdent with their computer skills and showed more  positive attitude toward computers.

Further, the data subjected to Chi-square test to test the  signifcance  of  variables  comprising  level  of  competency  in  computer  and  other  digital  devices  and  gender.  Chi-square  value is found to be signifcant as the p-value is less than 0.001.  Hence  null  hypothesis  is  rejected  and  accepted  that  there  is

signifcant difference in the level of competency  
among male and female students. Mean score for  
level of competency in digital devices is higher  Very high in  male  (23.54)  than  female  (17.84)  students.  63 (14.8) 
Hence it can be concluded that the competency  
in computer and digital devices is higher in male  63 (14.8) students compared to female students.  18 (4.2) 
4.3    Digital  Reading  Competency 26 (6.1) 
With  the  rapidly  developing  information  197 (46.2) 
technologies,  reading  on  the  screen  is  8 (1.9) 
transforming  into  an  absolute  necessity;  on  
the  grounds  that  the  texts  are  transferred  to  11 (2.6) the  computer  pages  and  they  are  published  16 (3.8) 
through computers. Table 4 sought to determine,  
whether  there  exists  any  gender  difference  in  15 (3.5) 
the digital reading competency of the students.  13 (3.1) 
It  is  worth  mentioning  that  the  male  students  
are  comparatively  more  competent  than  the  
female  students  in  all  the  following  activities  mentioned below related to digital reading competency. Index  of competency was compared between male and female with  Mann Whitney U test. Z-value is found to be signifcant either  at  0.05  level  or  at  0.01  level.  This  shows  that  there  exists  signifcant difference in the level of competency among male  and  female  students.  These  fndings  are  consisted  with  the  study results of Houtz & gupta28. They found signifcant gender  differences  in  the  way  female  and  male  rated  themselves  in  their ability to computer technology skills. 
A  score  for  level  of  competency  in  digital  reading  is  calculated  by  adding  the  scores  of  level  of  competency  to  each aspect. For each aspect, a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were  given to the response very low, low, moderate, high and very  high respectively. As there are 28 aspect total score of level  of  competency  in  between  0  to  112. This  expected  range  is  divided  into  three  groups.  Low  level  with  scores  ranges  in  between 0 to 36, medium level with scores ranges in between  37 to 74 and high level with scores ranges in between 75 to  112.  Classifcation  according  to  the  level  of  competency  is  given below in Table 5 shows that a majority of the students  (60.1) in the universities have a medium level of competency  in digital reading.  
Classifcation  based  on  level  of  competency  in  digital  reading among male and female students analysed results are  shown in Table 5. From the results it can be inferred that male  students exhibited a high level of competency as compared the  female students. It is also seen from the table that majority (77.5)  of the female students have medium level of competency in  digital reading. To test the signifcance of variable comprising  classifcation based on level of competency in digital reading  among male and female, Chi-square  test conducted and the  results shows that there is signifcant association between male  and female in their level of competency in digital reading since  the p-value is less than 0.01.  
Comparing the mean scores with those from male (74.21),  the female students have a lower mean scores (61.67) for the  competency in digital reading. This suggests that the difference  among the male and female students in their level of digital

4.4  Need  of training  for  Digital  Reading 
The ability to fnd and locate information on the Internet  is  essential  to  Web  based  reading.  Henry29  depicts  the  location of information as a critical ‘gatekeeper’ skill that to  a great extent determines the effectiveness of online reading  comprehension. The  respondents  were  asked  whether  or  not  they required training to improve their digital reading skills,  and the responses are presented in Table 6. 
It  is  found  that  more  than  50  per  cent  of  the  female  students indicated their interest for training in digital reading,  but only 29 per cent of male reported their interest in training.  Confrmed to this statement, Zhang30, et al.,reported the results  of a questionnaire survey among the students and teachers in  Dalian Nationalities which proposed that the users should be

supported with more training keeping in mind the end goal to  enhance their information seeking skills while using electronic  resources. Further the Chi-square test results reveal that there  is  signifcant  difference  among  male  and  female  students  in  their need of training for digital reading, since the p-value is  less than 0.01.

4.5  Confidence  in  Digital  Reading 
Readers who are confdent in online reading will extract  the contents of hypertext pages and furthermore meaningfully  link them according to a specifc reading goal31. When trying to  fnd out the level of confdence in digital reading among male  and female students, Table 7 below identifes that more than  50 per cent of male students said that they are good in their  confdence in digital reading.

Average  level  of  confdence  is  reported  by  nearly  half  per  cent  of  the  female  students.  It  is  also  interested  to  note  that compared to female students, 12 per cent of male students  reported  their  level  of  confdence  as  excellent.  By  applying  Chi-square test, the p-value of 0.001 exhibited in the Table 7 indicates a signifcant association at one per cent level between  the gender and their level of confdence in digital reading. This  reveals that difference among male and female students regarding  their  level  of  confdence  in  digital  reading  is  statistically  signifcant. On the whole it is noted that the male students have  high confdence in digital reading than female students. 
In  the  effort  made  to  test  the  relation  between  level  of  competency  to  use  computer  and  other  digital  devices  and  digital  reading  competency,  Correlation  coeffcient  worked  out  and  signifcance  was  tested  and  the  results  are  given  in  Table 8.

< 0.001 
 ** Signifcant at 0.01 level 
The  correlation  value  of  0.727  and  p-value  of  0.001  indicate that there exists a signifcant relation between the level  of competency to use computer and other digital devices and  digital reading competency at 0.01 level of signifcance. That  implies that the level of competency to use computer and other  digital  devices  is  positively  correlated  with  digital  reading  competency. These fndings underline that if students need to  be profcient in reading digital text, it is essential to support  them in mastering skills in dealing with ICT and in developing  effective  navigational  strategies  by  providing  appropriate  learning opportunities and directing them through challenges. 
5.  CONCLUSIONS 
good readers with high level of competency in computer,  digital  devices  and  effective  strategies  for  deciding  on  the  convenience and usefulness of Web-based information are able  to locate, evaluate, and synthesize Web-based information. In  other words, if students have diffculties with linear reading  or  lack  basic  computer  skills,  they  will  struggle  to  fnd  and  relate relevant information to other information, and are likely  to have problems with understanding hypertexts32.  
It  is  found  that  a  good  number  of  the  students  in  the  universities of Kerala showed a medium level of competency.  It  is  also  noted  that  male  students  exhibited  a  high  level  of  competency  as  compared  to  female  students.  Results  also  depicted that there exist signifcant relationship between digital  reading competency and level of competency to use computer  and  other  digital  devices.  In  the  digital  environment  the  knowledge, expertise and confdence with computer and other  advanced  digital  devices  are  currently  a  beneft  for  students  whose aim is utilise an assortment of information sources.  
For improving the digital reading competency of students,  orientation  programs  like  digital  literacy  training  should  be  provided. Organising an online information searching workshop  can  help  the  students  in  searching  the  exact  information,  so  the students can get an idea of how to refne a search strategy.  Educators  should  assist  the  students  to  acquire  the  needed  digital literacy skills, to effectively access, retrieve and read  the digital information, and beneft from the myriads of digital  resources  available  to  them  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  academic and research work.
