1.  IntROductIOn 
According to the father of artifcial intelligence (AI), John  McCarthy, artifcial intelligence is defned as the “The science  and  engineering  of  making  intelligent  machines,  especially  intelligent  computer  programs”.  Artifcial  intelligence  is  a  way  of  making  a  computer,  computer-controlled  software  thinks intelligently, in a manner similar to the way intelligent  humans think. The main goals of AI are: (i) to create expert  systems  -  the  systems  which  exhibit  intelligent  behavior,  learn,  demonstrate,  explain  and  advice  its  users  and  (ii)  to  implement human intelligence in machines – to create systems  that understand, think, learn and behave like humans. Artifcial  intelligence is about select science and technology based on  disciplines  such  as  computer  science,  biology,  psychology,  linguistics, mathematics and engineering. A major thrust of AI  is in development of computer functions associated with human  intelligence such as reasoning, learning and problem solving.  AI has been dominant in various felds such as gaming, natural  language processing, expert systems, vision systems, speech  recognition,  handwriting  recognition  and  intelligent  robots.  The  domain  of  AI  is  huge  in  breadth  and  width.  Here  we

consider common and prospering research areas in the domain  of AI as: expert systems, natural language processing, neural  networks, fuzzy logic and robotics1.   
1.1  Literature  Review 
A  select  few  studies  that  were  undertaken  in  the  past  focused on quantitative analysis of global output on artifcial  intelligence  research  covering  different  study  periods  and  different  aspects  of  the  subject  in  their  research  analysis..  Among such studies, Niu2,  et al.  (i) carried out a multi-angle  assessment  of  research  productivity  in  the  area  of  artifcial  research  (AI)  by  subject  category,  journal,  author,  country,  institution  and  keywords  covering  the  period  during  1990  to  2014;  (ii)  analyzed  signifcant  publication  patterns  in  the  domain  of  AI  research;  and  (iii)  provided  a  summarization  of  the  research  directions  and  trends  in  the  feld  of  AI.  Gunasekaran  and  Shanmugam3   examined  global  artifcial  intelligence research output (10795 papers) published during  1981-2010, and reported growth characteristics, continent-wise  and country-wise distribution, identifcation of prolifc authors  and  journals,  collaborative  patterns,  etc.  Cheng  and  Wang4 analyzed global artifcial intelligence research output covering  the period during 2000-2011, and reported article distribution  by  publication  year,  languages,  countries/regions,  authors,

journals,  etc.  Besselaar  and  Leyesdorf5   mapped  changes  in  development  of  artifcial  intelligence  specialty  during  1982- 1992. The authors used aggregated journal-to-journal citations  for describing AI as sets of journals; they used factor analytical  technique  to  analyze  the  developments  in  AI  in  terms  of  (emerging) stability and coherence of the journal sets during  the  period  1982  to  1992.  Shrivastava  and  Mahajan6   studied  the  artifcial  intelligence  research  in  Indian  context  which  analysed data from Scopus database published during 1968 to  2014. The study reported growth characteristics, citation per  paper, keywords, national and international collaboration, and  organization-wise distributions, etc. Besides, there were a few  other bibliometric studies carried out in India, which assessed  the  overall  computer  science  research  output  (including  artifcial  intelligence)  in  India  and  covered  different  study  aspects and periods7-10.  
2.  ObjectIveS 
The  main  aim  of  this  study  is  to  understand  India’s  performance  in  artifcial  intelligence  research  covering  research data published during 2007-16. The publications data  for the study was sourced from Scopus database. In particular,  the study focuses on the following objectives 
• To study the global output in artifcial intelligence research  
and contribution of top 10 most productive countries  • To study the growth of Indian research output in artifcial  
intelligence, its global share and its citation impact • To  study  the  international  collaboration  of  Indian

• To study the publication productivity and citation impact  
of  top  10  most  productive  Indian  organizations  and  
authors  
• To study the modes of communication in research • To study the characteristics of top highly cited papers. 
3.  MethOdOLOgy 
The study retrieved and downloaded 10-year publications  data  of  the  world  in  artifcial  intelligence  research  from  the  Scopus database (http://www.scopus.com) covering the period  2007-16.  Keywords  such  as  “artifcial  intelligence’’  were  tagged  to  “Keyword  tag”  and  “Article  tag”,  and  the  search  period  ‘2007-16’  to  “date  range  tag”.  This  search  strategy  was  used  as  the  main  search  string  to  get  publications  data  of the world output and also publications data of top 10 most  productive  countries.  This  main  search  string  was  further  restricted to India in “Affliation tag” to get publication data on  India’s output on artifcial intelligence research. By applying  analytical provisions/ tags available in Scopus database such  as “subject area tag”, “country tag”, “source title tag”, “journal  title name” and “affliation tag” – India’s output was accordingly  refned by subject, collaborating countries, organization-wise,  author-wise and journal-wise, etc. For citation data, citations to  publications were also collected from date of publication till 15  
May 2017. The Indian publications data was analyzed across  a few select bibliometric indicators with a view to understand  the  research  activity  in  artifcial  intelligence  research.  we  have used here complete counting method, where all authors  or organizations to multi-authored papers have received equal  credit in data counting and analysis. All types of documents  have been used in this study. The conference papers and papers  in book series and journals together constitute 99.86 % of the  total Indian publications output in artifcial intelligence during  2007-16. for  impact  factor,  2015  data  has  been  used  and  is  collected from the journal websites.

5.  SuMMARy And cOncLuSIOn  
Using publications data from Scopus database, this study  provides a quantitative and qualitative description of artifcial  intelligence research covering a period of 10 years. The global  r&d   efforts  in  artifcial  intelligence  are  now  spread  across  100+  countries;  the  total  world  output  cumulated  to  152655  publications  during  2007-16.  Top  10  countries  in  the  world  accounted  for  74.32  per  cent  global  publication  share  in  artifcial intelligence research; country wise their global share  ranged between 3.68 per cent and 19.46 per cent, with China  accounting for the largest global publications share (19.46 %),  followed by USA (17.96 %), India (6.37 %), U.K. (6.33 %),  etc.  
India’s growth rate in artifcial intelligence research was  27.45 per cent compared to 9.82 per cent by the world. In the  world  ranking,  India  ranks  third  highest  with  6.37  per  cent  global  publications  share  (a  total  of  9730  publication  in  10  years). Its research impact averaged to mere 2.76 citations per  paper. India’s share of international collaborative publications  was mere 10.34 per cent. India’s top 10 organisations accounted  for 19.31 per cent national publications share and 29.78 per  cent national citation share during 2007-16. Computer Science,  among  subjects,  contributed  the  largest  publication  share  (86.99 %), followed by engineering (30.69 %), mathematics  (15.95 %), and several other disciplines during 2007-16. of the  9730 publication contributed by India in artifcial intelligence  research,  only  24  emerged  as  highly  cited  publications,  averaging  162.46  citations  per  paper.  These  24  highly  cited  papers were the outcome of participation by 109 authors from  70 organizations, and published in 15 journals. of the 24 highly  cited papers, only 9 were international collaborative papers - 4  each from collaboration with the USA and U.K., 2 each from  Germany,  Singapore  and  Germany,  and  1  each  from  Japan,  Mexico, Australia, Qatar, Canada, Italy and Poland. 
Conclusion:  India  stands  third  highest  in  the  world  ranking in artifcial intelligence research, behind China and the  USA, (among 100 + countries) with 6.37 per cent  its global  publications  share.  China  and  the  USA  dominate  the  world;  their  combined  global  publications  share,  37.42  per  cent,  being the largest in artifcial intelligence research. Currently,  top 10 academic organizations from India account for 19.21  per  cent  national  publications  share.  If  India  is  to  become  competitive  with  the  world  leaders  in  artifcial  intelligence  research, academic and research organizations in the country  will have to give still better performance in future. To meet  such  expectations,  the  stakeholders  need  to  play  a  catalytic  role  to  build  and  strengthen  research  capacity  in  the  nation  by  way  of  quality research environment,  adequate  funding,  research incentives,  and  quality  research  faculty.

fnds  that  India’s  qualitative  performance  has  not  been  as  stunning as its quantitative performance in research-its research  impact  in  artifcial  intelligence  research  has  been  low,  mere  2.76 citations per paper in 10 years; its output of highly cited  papers has also been low, mere 0.25 per cent share of its total  output.  Hence,  it  is  important  that  stakeholders  pay  special  attention to academic and research organizations in the country  encouraging them to undertake more and more new research  projects, programmes in collaboration with international hubs  in artifcial intelligence research.
