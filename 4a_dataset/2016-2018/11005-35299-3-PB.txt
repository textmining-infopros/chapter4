ABSTRACT 
Author analysed the characteristics of articles published by the Indian based authors in the ‘Information Science  & Library Science’ subject category of Web of Science during 1991-2015. In this study, total 708 articles derived  from the Web of Science database were analysed. The Indian contributions to the Information Science and Library  Science quite meager in compare to world’s contribution. However, the Indian based articles were kept rising from  1991 to 2015. The articles published from1996 to 2005 have greater impact and the trend is towards multiple authors.  The Scientometrics was the most productive journal; almost 25 per cent of the Indian articles were published during  the period. Gupta, BM was the most productive author and articles published by the Bhattacharya, S, Nagpaul, PS  and Rao, IKR had greater impact on the subject as well as fellow researches in the subject category of IS & LS.

1.  INTRODUCTION  
Bibliometrics  is  an  area  of  research  in  Library  and  Information Science subject, which has received considerable  attention  from  the  researchers  all  over  the  world  for  past  decade3.  Many  authors  reported  their  work  on  research  performance of a country in library and Information Science  using bibliometric tools and techniques, for example, China4,  Bangladesh5,  South  Africa6,  Pakistan7.  Many  authors  had  undertaken a study to evaluate the Indian research performance  in  library  and  information  science  using  data  from  different  databases8-11. No study was conducted to analysis the Indian  contributions in the subject category of ‘Information Science  &  Library  Science’  from  the  Web  of  Science  database  for  the  period  of  1991-2015.  An  effort  is  made  here  to  reveal  the  scientifc  output  of  the  India  in  the  subject  category  of  information science and library science as refected in the Web  of Science for the period of 1991-2015, which could provide  the insight into the publication trend and achievements in the  subject. This study would provide information on publication  trends in the Information Science & Library Science by Indian  authors, which would be useful to the researchers and policy  makers in India.  
2.  LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Some of the relevant studies are worth mentioning here  to give the complete insight into the present research topic in  a perspective. Pradhan and Chandrakar8  also made a study to  fgure out the growth of (Library & Information Science)LIS

literature from Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) Database  during  2000-2009.  The  contribution  of  the  Indian  based  authors were very less (only 1.07%) compared to the world LIS  literature available in SSCI database for the period 2000-2009.  But, gradually Indian contributions in peer-reviewed journals  are increasing. Patra and Chand11  did an effort to reveal the  contribution of India’s in LIS during 1967-2004. They found  that P.N. Kaula was the most productive author and the literature  produced by the Indian authors rather negligible. Khan5, et al.  made a study on LIS research in Bangladesh during1966-1977.  The  study  found  that  a  total  of  308  articles  were  published  which were authored by 116 authors on an average of 9. 62  article per year, and 2. 6 articles per author.  
Tiwari12  also did a study of Indian contribution in the LIS  research. The data was collected from the 30 journals, which  are  published  from  the  India  during  1975-1995.  The  study  reveal  that  majority  of  the  articles  were  from  the  UP  based  authors and Annals of Library Science and Documentation  was  the most productive journal. Wani13, et al. mapped literature  outputs  available  through  Library,  Information  Science  and  Technology  Abstracts  (LISTA)  during  1850s  to  2000s.  The  fndings  indicate  that  the  growth  of  literature  in  library  and  information  science  is  on  increase.  U.  S. A.  ranks  frst  with  301  (37.76%)  publications.  Maharana  and  Das  (2014)  also  conducted a study to observe the growth and development of  LIS research in India during 1999-2013. The fndings of the  study include that the annual publications of Indian researchers  range from 9 to 10 articles with 0. 64 degree of collaboration.  He  and Wang4 also  did  a  study  to  quantitatively  analyse  the  research activity in the area of Chinese Library and Information

Science  (LIS)  from  1975  to  2004  based  on  Social  Sciences  Citation  Index  (SSCI).  Result  shows  solid  increase  in  both  the number of papers and the quality of publishing channels.  About more than half of the total LIS papers in China were  from universities and the Web of Science (WOS) journals are  representative  for  the  Chinese  LIS  publications  in  general.  Kurshid7  analysed the articles contributed in LIS by Pakistani  authors for the period 1947-1997. The Pakistan based author’s  contributions to LIS literature quite reasonable and authorship  pattern is towards multiple authors and non-resident Pakistani  authors’ share in the global LIS literature is much better than  their counterparts living in Pakistan.  
3.  OBJECTIVES  
The main of objectives of the study are:  
(i) 	 Review  the  literature  produced  by  the  Indian  based  
authors in Information Science &Library Science subject  
category in Web of Science during 1991-2015 (ii) 	 Compare the world publication output with India (iii) 	 Reveal the authorship pattern and citation information (iv) 	 Discover most productive journals 
(v) 	 Divulge the most prolifc authors 
(vi) 	 Reveal the characteristics of top nine most cited articles (vii) 	 Aanalyse  the  words  from  the  title  and  abstracts  of  the  
articles.  
4.  METHODOLOGY  
The primary data for the study was extracted from Web  of Science (updated on 08-07-2016). There were 85 journals  listed in the subject category of Information Science & Library  Science (JCR 2014). Author used advanced search techniques:  WC=  (Information  Science  &  Library  Science)  AND  AD=  (India) and the time span during 1991 to 2015 to collect the  required  data. A  total  of  904  documents  were  found  in  the  database, including articles (708). Further, bibliographic details  such as title, authors, source, and citations were downloaded  in  the  excel  spreadsheet.  As  the  tradition  followed  in  the  bibliometric  studies,  we  considered  the  articles  for  analysis  purpose,  as  the  articles  contain  description  of  complete  researches and results14. In the Web of Science database, the  corresponding author is labelled as the reprint author. In this  study, reprint author is referred to as the corresponding author.  In a single-author article where authorship is not specifed, the  author is classifed as both the frst author and the corresponding  author15. As for the author, if one author was assigned as the frst  author of one article, the article was considered as ‘frst author  article’ of the author; and if one author was assigned as the  corresponding author of one article, the article was considered  as ‘corresponding author article’ of the author16.  
5.  RESULTS AND  DISCUSSION  
5.1 Comparison  of  Indian  Publications  over World’s 
The  Table  1  provides  comparative  output  of  total  publications and research articles of Indian and World in the  subject category of Information Science & Library Science (IS  & LS) in the Web of Science database during 1991-2015. In  1991, there were a total of 5,117 documents were in the subject  category by World, while there were only 17 documents were  
388 
from the Indian based authors. However, in 2015, the world’s  publication reached to 11,154, while India’s were 94 documents.  This shows that India’s publications were poorly represented in  the subject category of IS & LS. Similarly, the research articles  from  Indian  authors  were  also  negligible  in  compare  to  the  world’s contributions. One of the reasons for this may be that  most of the Indian authors may prefer to publish their research  fndings in the local journals11. The journals that are indexed in  the WoS follow high stranded of editorial process, and majority  of the time there is a chance of being rejected1. English writing  skills may play a vital role while publications in the reputed  journals. In 1991, Indian authors had contributed a share 0.02  % to the world’s publications, later it went raising, in 2015; it  has reached to 0.13% of the total articles. In total, 1.04% of the  literature was contributed by the Indian authors during 1991- 2015. In the study of Khurshid7, a total of 516 articles were  published by the Pakistani authors for the period of 1957 to  2011. A total of 440 articles were published in local and foreign  journals  by  the  Bangladeshi  authors  for  the  period  of  1966  to  19975.  Similarly,  China  had  contributed  351  publications  during  1975-20044.  The  Fig.  1  illustrates  the  publication  trends of Indian and World’s total publication in the subject  category of IS & LS over years. In 1993, a striking pick up in  world’s publications is evident and later some slight decline  is observed here and there. Indian publications were unsteady  in growth from 1991 to 2013, in 2014, a good pick up is seen  in the growth of a total publications. The publications trend in  the articles in the subject category of IS & LS in comparison  with  India’s  and  World’s  publications  is  illustrated  in  the  Fig.  2.  In  1991,  there  were  2,250  articles  by  world’s,  while  only 13 articles were contributed by the Indian authors, which  is  a  meager.  The  publication  trends  of  world’s  publication  were kept increasing while India’s publications were growing  inconsistently  over  years.  However,  the  India’s  publications  had got pick up in the 2014 and 2015.

5.2 Types  of  Documents  with  Citations  
The Table 2 provides the types of documents with average  citations  per  document  published  in  the  subject  category  of  Information  Science  and  Library  Science  by  Indian  based  authors from 1991 to 2015. A total of thirteen types of documents  were  published,  article  being  most  with  708,  accounting  for  78.32% of the total documents followed by the book review  (73; 8.08%), proceeding paper (46; 5.09%), letter (34; 3.76%),  editorial  material  (21;  2.32%),  review  (9;  1.0%),  note  (6;  0.66%), meeting abstract (2; 0.22%), biographical item (1; 0.  1%), reprint (1; 0.11%), chronology (1; 0.11%), bibliography  (1;0.11%), and item about individual (1; 0.11%), respectively.  Citations are the indicators of the impact of work in the subject  and on the researchers in the feld of study17-20. The review papers  have  greater  average  citations  count  per  article  (8.89).  The  second greater average citations were recorded to proceeding  papers (8.71) followed by the article (5.84), chronology (2.00),

5.3  Five  Year’s  Publications  Trend  with Average  
Citations  and Authors  
Figure 1 shows trends in publication of Indian articles in  fve- 5 years span with average citations per article for the period  of 1991-2015. In the years 1991-95, there were 71 articles and  in 2011-15, it has reached to 281 articles. There is an absolute  increase in the number of articles for every fve years. It shows  that the Indian based authors trying their best to publish their  research fndings in the Web of Science indexed journals. A total  of 708 articles had received 4,139 citations with an average of  5. 84 par article. The articles that are published in the period of  1996-00 and 2001-05 had recorded average of 10 citations per  article, which is quite higher than overall average citations per  article (5.84). It can be note that the articles that published in  this period have greater impact. A lowest citations per article  (2.1) is seen for the recently published articles (2011-2015),  it’s quite natural that articles need suffcient time to get cited in  the other articles17.  
The Fig. 2 shows the trends in authorship pattern in the  articles published by the Indian based authors in the subject  category of IS & LS in the period of 1991-2015, in fve-5 year’s  time span. A total of 708 articles were contributed by the 967  unique authors with an average of 1.36 authors per article. Out  of 708 articles, 207 articles were contributed by single authors,  278 articles by joint authors, 149 articles by three authors and  remaining 70 articles were contributed by the more than three  authors, respectively. In the period of 1991-05, there were 1.4  authors  per  article,  while  in  2001-15,  it  went  to  1.9  authors  per article. It can be noted from this result that the multiple  authorship pattern is taking place in the articles published in  the subject category of IS & LS subject category.

5.4 Productive  Journals  and  Prolific Authors  
Table  3  presents  the  journals  that  had  published  at  least eight or more articles contributed by at least one of the  Indian based authors in the period of 1991-2015. The journal  impact factor along with global rank as per Journal Citation  Report-2014 is also provided for the information. Out of 85  journals in IS & LS subject category in WoS, 77 journals had  published at least one article from the Indian based authors.  The  journal Scientometrics was  the  most  productive  journal  with 172 articles, which accounts for the 24.29% of the total  contribution  from  the  Indian  bused  authors  followed  by  the  Electronic Library  (75; 10.59%),  Program-Electronic Library  and  Information  Systems(46;  6.50%), Journal  of  Knowledge  Management   (21;  2.97%),  Knowledge  Organisation   (20;  2.82%), Malaysian Journal of Library & Information Science (17; 2.40%), International Journal of Information Management (16;  2.26%),and  Telecommunications  Policy   (16;  2.26%).  The journals with higher impact factor as per JCR-2014 have  published considerable number of articles, such as, Information  Systems Research (2.436), Scientometrics (2.183), and Journal  of  Management  Information  Systems(2.062),  respectively.  One  more  interesting  fact  is  that  almost  a  quarter  of  total  articles  published  by  Indian  based  authors  are  published  in  the scientomtrics, which can be the studies related to research  evaluation studies based on the bibliometrics or scientometrics  tools and techniques.  
The evaluation of author’s performance based on the total  articles, frst author articles, and corresponding authors articles  have been studied recently16. Table 4 gives the list of the authors  from India who has contributed at least nine or more articles  in  the  subject  category  of  Information  Science  and  Library  Science during the period of 1991-2015. The authorship list  can  be  based  on  contribution,  alphabetical  order,  or  reverse  seniority,  but  the  approach  most  often  used  is  ordering  by  contribution,  especially  for  articles  with  few  authors21.  generally the frst author is one who is more responsible for  the research work and he should get major portion of the credit  as compare to others22. Similarly, corresponding author is one  who plays a vital role in planning and execution of the project,  hence, he should be rewarded with same part of credit as frst  author deserve23.  
Gupta, BM has emerged as most productive author with  33 articles followed by the garg, KC (24), Prathap, g  (20),  Rao, IKR (15), Kumar, V (15), Rao, SS (14), bhattacharya, S  (11), Kademani, bS (10), Karisiddappa, CR (9), and Nagpaul,  PS (9), respectively. gupta, bM takes the 1st  rank in the total  articles and frst author articles. This indicates that the author  is highly involved in the research and his contribution to the  IS & LS is quite reasonable. Prathap, G takes the 1st  rank in  case  of  corresponding  author  articles  (20)  and  single  author  articles (19). This result indicates that the author is independent  capable worker and prefers to conduct research alone. Kumar,  V and Rao, IKR prefer to carry out research in collaboration  with others. The average citation counts for articles published  by bhattacharya,  S(14.  72),  Nagpaul,  PS  (12.33),  and  Rao,  IKR (11.66) quite higher than average citations of total articles  (5.84). It confrms that the articles written by bhattacharya, S,  Nagpaul, PS and Rao, IKR hadgreater impact on the subject as

6.  CONCLUSIONS  
An attempt is made to reveal the bibliometric characteristics  of articles contributed by Indian based authors in the subject  category of Information Science and Library Science in Web  of Science for the period of 1991-2015 in this paper. A total  of 708 articles were contributed by the Indian authors for the  period, which accounts for 1. 04 % of the global contributions.  The reasons for this may that the Indian based authors prefer  to  publish  their  works  in  the  local  journals.  The  articles  published in 1996 to 20005 have received greater citations and  the  analysis  of  authorship  pattern  shows  that  trend  towards  multiple authors. The journal Scientometrics  was the preferred  and productive journal among the all journals. Almost a quarter  of total articles were published in the Scientometrics  journal.  Gupta,  BM  was  the  most  productive  author  and  the  articles  published by the Bhattacharya, S, Nagpaul, PS and Rao, IKR  had greater impact on the subject as well as fellow researches  in the subject category of IS & LS for the period of 1991-2015.  The article entitled as ‘Shape measures for content based image  retrieval: A comparison’ published in Information Processing  
& Management  was the most frequently cited article with 199  citations since it publication and article ranked 1st  in TC average citations per year. It is confrmed from the analysis of  
2015 and  word from title and abstract of the articles published by Indian  based authors in IS & LS subject category that a huge numbers  of articles were on bibliometrics and scientometrics analysis  based studies. The limitation of the present study are that the  citations presented here is solely based on WoS database and  hence may not be comprehensive and also, citations may have  missed in the WoS database due to the possibilities of simple  spelling  errors  in  titles  and  DOI34.  However,  this  analysis  wouldcreate  awareness  among  the  librarians,  information  scientists and others involved in economic, social and research  policies in India.
