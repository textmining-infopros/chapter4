of Agricultural Universities, 2016-17. The 15 year publication  data  of  CCSHAU  indicate  that  a  total  of  2649  paper  were  
published from 2001-2015 which received 15282 citation  
with  an  average  citation  per  paper  of  5.77.  The  major  
publication of the university fall under the subject category  
agricultural  and  biological  sciences.  The  university  
collaborated  with  many  other  institutes  at  national  and  
international  front  for  conducting  research.  The  major  
collaborator  at  national  level  was  College  of  Veterinary  
Science  and  at  international  level  was  Wageningen  
University and Research Centre, Netherland. Nearly 47% of  
the university research was published in 10 journals among  
which the maximum papers were published in the journal  
Annals of Biology  which accounted for more than 1/10 
th 
 of  
the total publication during the time period under study. N.  
Khetarpaul of Department of Foods and Nutrition was the  front runner in terms of publication. Among the various types  of publication, the books and review articles of the university  received more citations. Three authors collaboration dominated  the research of the university and the collaborative coeffcient  was calculated to be 0.668. More than half of the publication  of CCSHAU were cited by others in their publication.  The  highest citations were received by a paper by Cavanagh et al  which was published in “Proceedings of the National Academy  of Sciences of the United States of America” during 2013. Out  of the total 2649 paper, 13 have been cited more than 100 time.  The study gives a good indication of the publication pattern of  the university and its collaborations with others for research  activities.
