Scientometric analysis of 200 research article published in the journal, “Metamorphosis: A  Journal  of  Management Research” from its debut year 2002 to 2016 is studied. The study focuses on various aspects of the  journal such as the distribution of articles, annual growth rate, authorship pattern, authorship productivity, degree  of collaboration, collaborative index, country-wise distribution of articles, citation analysis. The study shows that  most of the papers, 114 out of 200 (57per cent) were published by single authors whereas 86 out of 200 (43 per  cent) were contributed by joint authors. Overall average degree of collaboration, average collaborative index and  average citation per paper were 0.43, 2.35, and 25.59, respectively. Remarkable collaborative contributors are from  India with 81.65 per cent sharing. The study may help those who wish to map the scientometric patterns of journals  
or institutions or an individual.

1. IntRoductIon 
Scientometrics  is  a  branch  of  the  science,  ‘Science  of  Science’.  Haitun1  treats  Scientometrics,  as  a  scientifc  discipline,  which  performs  reproducible  measurements  of  scientifc  activity.  Now  a  days,  scientometrics  is  one  of  the  truly  interdisciplinary  research  feld  extended  to  almost  all  scientifc  felds.  For  conducting  this  study,  Metamorphosis:  A  Journal  of  Management  Research   has  been  taken  into  account.  In  this  mapping  study,  the  authors  has  discussed,  analysed,  and  calculated  different  scientometric  aspects  by  using scientometric tools such as the degree of collaboration,  collaborative index, average author per paper.

Alan  Pritchard  explained  the  bibliometrics  as  “the  application  of  mathematical  and  statistical  methods  to  books  and  other  media  of  communication”2.  Nalimov  and  Mulchenko3  interpreted scientometrics as “the application of  those quantitative methods which are dealing with the analysis  of science viewed as an information process”. 
For  conducting  this  study,  the  authors  have  reviewed  many related research articles. Singh4  has done a Scientometric  analysis of Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Physics  for the  period  from  2006-2010  using  Web  of  Science  database.  He  concluded that the maximum numbers of papers were published  in joint authorship with 93.46 per cent where as merely 6.54 per  cent papers were contributed as single authored. The author R.  Kumar and the institution CSIR were the most prolifc author  and  institution  with  8.29  per  cent  and  3.2  per  cent  sharing

respectively. 1.87 average citations per paper were noticed. 
Velmurugan  and  Radhakrishnan5   conducted  the  scientometric  study  of  Malaysian  Journal  of  Library  and  Information  Science.  In  their  study,  they  described  that  the  highest numbers of contributions (75.36 per cent) were from  joint authors and rest 24.64 per cent contributions were single  authored.  The  country  Malaysia  placed  frst  with  31.84  per  cent  contribution  whereas  India  placed  third  with  11.01  per  cent contribution. The average author per paper, the average  productivity per author and degree of collaboration was 2.36,  0.42 and 0.75 respectively during the period between 2008 to  2014. 
Navaneethakrishnan6  in his study analysed that multiple  authors published the maximum research papers. The degree  of  collaboration  was  progressively  increased.  It  was  0.33  in  the  year  1962  and  0.80  in  the  year  2012.  US  collaborative  contributors got the frst rank with 15.93 per cent contributions  during the study span. 
A  Scientometric  analysis  of  203  article  published  in   Annals of Library and Information Studies  has also been done  by  Velmurugan7   for  the  years  2007  to  2012.  He  concluded  that most of the contributions 88 (43.35 per cent) were by two  authors,  the  highest  number  of  contributions  43  (21.19  per  cent) were in 2010 and the least number 27 (13.31 per cent)  were published in 2012. Maximum research output 39(22.94  per  cent)  was  related  to  the  ‘User  Studies’  subject  feld  and  37  articles  were  related  to  bibliometrics,  scientometrics  and  webometrics.

6.1   y ear-wise distribution  of Articles 
Table  1 provides chronological distribution of publications  of  the  study  span.  Out  of  200  publication  published  during  the period 2002-2016, the maximum number of 19 (9.50 per  cent) papers were published in 2010 followed by 2007 (8.50  per  cent),  2008  (8.00  per  cent)  and  2011  (7.50  per  cent),  respectively.  The  minimum  numbers  of  10  (5.00  per  cent)  papers were published in two different years, i.e. in 2003 and  2014. The range of publications per year is in between 10-19  per cent. It is noted that 50 per cent of holistic publications  output is from 2002 to 2009, and the balance (50 per cent) were  published in between 2010 to 2016. It is also revealed that equal  contributions occurred during the periods 2012, 2013 and 2016  (7.00 per cent), 2002, 2004, 2005, 2009 and 2015 have 6.00 per  cent each and 2003 and 2014 have 5.00 per cent each. 
6.2 Annual growth  Rate  of  Research Articles 
Annual growth rate (AGR) is the change in the value of a  measurement over the period of a year. To calculate AGR, we  used below-listed formula ; 
AGR=  end value – First value   * 100 
    First value 
Table  1 also provides a complete scenario of AGR from  the  year  2002  to  2016.  It  is  observed  that  the  highest AGR  58.33 per cent was noticed in the year 2010 followed by 54.55  per cent in 2007, the same AGR 20 per cent in the year 2004  and 2015 and 16.67 per cent in 2016 respectively. The lowest  AGR -28.57 per cent was noticed in the year 2014. The range  of AGR during the study span is in between -28.57 per cent to  58.33 per cent. Velmurugan and Radhakrishnan5  have used the  same formula in their research work.

6.3  Authorship  Pattern 
Table  2 show a complete authorship pattern. Out of 200  contributions, 114 (57 %) were contributed by single authors  followed by 59 (29.50 %) by double author, 24 (12 per cent)  by triple author and merely 3 (1.50 per cent) by four authors  respectively. It is noted that more than 50 per cent articles were  authored by single author and the least number, 3 (1.50 %) by  four authors. 
6.4  Authorship  Pattern  of  Solo  vs co-Authorship  
contributions 
Table  3 depicts that the maximum number of articles were  contributed in single authorship with 114 records out of 200  total items along with 57 per cent sharing. Eighty-six articles  with 43 per cent sharing were noticed in the joint-authorship  which is less in comparison to single authorship pattern. More  than 50 per cent articles were published in single authorship  productivity. 
6.5  Author  Productivity 
Table  4 shows a real picture of average author per paper  (AAPP) and productivity per author in the stipulated time span.  The authors calculated the AAPP and productivity per author  by using formula as follows. 
AAPP =   Number of authors 
          Number of papers

Here we found minimum AAPP as 1.08 with maximum  productivity  per  author  is  0.92  in  the  year  2002.  On  the  other  hand,  we  got  maximum AAPP  at  2.07  with  minimum  productivity per author at 0.48 in the year 2013. 
6.6  Single  vs  Multi-Authored  Papers 
Table  5  represents that out of 200 research offerings, single  authored are 114 articles while the rest eighty-six papers were  contributed by joint authors. It is analysed that the maximum  research articles were published by single authors. 
6.7   d egree  of collaboration 
The degree of collaboration is defned as the ratio of the  number of collaborative research papers to the total number of  research papers in the discipline during a given period of time.  It is calculated by Subramanyam8  formula 
C =  _ Nm__ 
      Nm+Ns 
where C is degree of collaboration in discipline, Nm is  number  of  multi-authored  papers  in  the  discipline  published  during a year, and Ns is number of single authored papers in  the discipline published during a year 
Table   6  reveal  that  the  highest  value  of  DC  0.71  was  observed  in  the  year  2013  and  the  lowest  value  of  0.08  in  the  year  2002.  There  were  fuctuations  in  the  degree  of  collaboration, and the overall value of DC was 0.43 during the  study span. 
6.8 collaborative  Index  of Articles 
It is a mean number of authors per joint paper. For this  analysis, the authors omitted the single authored papers which  are equal to 1 always. To determine the mean number of authors  per jointly authored paper, the following formula has been used  by Elango and Rajendran9  in their scientometric study; 
CI = Total number of authors 
        Total joint papers 
It can be observed from Table  7 that there was maximum
