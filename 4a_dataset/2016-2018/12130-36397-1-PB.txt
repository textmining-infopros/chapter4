The  paper  examines  13021  Indian  publications  on  mobile  research  during  2007-16,as  covered  in  Scopus  database. The Indian publications were downloaded using a search strategy  which uses the search term ‘mobile*’  in the two tags, namely ‘keyword tag’ and ‘Article Title tag’ and restricting it to the India in ‘country tag’ and  period 2007-16 in ‘date range tag’. The Indian mobile research output experiencing an annual average growth rate  of 22.64 per cent, global share of 5.88 per cent, citation impact of 2.11 and international collaborative publication  share of 11.28 per cent during 2007-16. Computer Science, among subjects, contributed the largest publication  share  (74.61),  engineering  (38.32%),  mathematics  and  social  sciences  (6.94%  and  6.54),  etc.  during  2007-16.  Amongst14 subfelds identifed in India’s mobile research, mobile networks contributed the largest publication share  (53.19%), followed by mobile telecommunication systems (35.09%), Mobile communication (29.22%), mobile ad  hoc networks (26.86%), mobile security (20.62%), etc. The most productive 20 Indian organisations and authors  together contributed 25.64 per cent and 5.11 per cent  share to the overall publications output of India in mobile  research  during 2007-16.The top 20 journals contributed 23.0 per cent share to the Indian journal output during  2007-16. Only 14 publications have registered citations from 109 to 548 and these together received3259 citations,  with 232.79 citations per paper. Conclude that India is still not a leading country in the world on mobile research  both in terms of quantity and quality of research. In view of strategic and global importance and to increase the  research output and quality, the Indian Government needs to identify this area as one of the national priority area,  involving much larger R&D investments and trained manpower and also increase international collaboration with  
leading mobile research hubs.

1.  IntROductIOn 
Mobile  phones  in  India  have  become  integral  part  of  everyday  life,  connecting  us  wirelessly  to  family,  friends,  services and work 24/7. Twenty years ago there weren’t any  mobile phones  and  since then a lot of  things have changed.  Mobile phones and mobile internet have changed the way we do  things and how we connect with other people. For individuals,  mobile  devices  are  not  just  for  communication.  They  offer  rich  digital  experiences  on  the  go.  Traditional  services  like  voice and SMS are gradually being replaced by mobile data  services. Mobile content usage is dominated by email, social  networking, chat, games and news. People use mobile for data  services such as GPS, Google map, data collection, effciency  and  data  accuracy,  real-time  analytics,  multilingual  support,  data verifcation, and voice to text services.  
Mobile  is  going  to  play  a  major  role  in  realising  the  Digital  India  vision,  with  mobile  emerging  as  the  dominant  platform, leading technology for internet access in the country.  Accessing  the  internet  using  mobile  handsets  has  increased  dramatically  in  recent  years.  Growing  investments  in  4G

networks promise to drive mobile even more deeply into our  economy  and  society.  There  are  616  million  unique  mobile  users in India, and by 2020 the number of unique users will  touch 951 million with around 1.4 billion mobile connections  (SIM)1. This makes India the second largest mobile market in  the world, after China. Besides, India still continues to be the  fastest growing mobile market in the world – It added over 100  million new subscribers in the past 18 months alone from June  2014 to March 2016. Urban mobile subscriber share stands at  56.96 per cent compared to 43.04 per cent of rural subscribers.  India’s urban tele-density is 148.73 while rural is 50.882.  
Previously  mobile  stood  separate  from  other  digital  technologies.  Now,  everything  digital  is  also  going  mobile:  computers,  software,  the  internet,  cloud  and  social  media.  Mobile is also making signifcant impact on businesses and the  society3. Mobile is changing how businesses operate, changing  interactions with consumers. Mobile is now a popular source of  sales / revenue, and a marketing and engagement opportunity,  with new behavioural and geo-locational targeting strategies.  For some business it is a service delivery channel. Customers  use mobile for scanning and comparison shopping, on the spot,  in retail store.  Search and search engine optimisation are rapidly

changing. The  mobile  ecosystem  is  widening  encompassing  several  components  such  as  application  developers,  content  providers,  mobile  web,  M-commerce,  and  M2M  facilitating  communication  between  appliances  and  mobile  technology.  Research and innovation across the world is driving the mobile  industry, mobile computing and communication technologies.  India  too  is  contributing  to  mobile  research  and  innovation.  It  should  be  worthwhile  undertaking  a  study  for  assessing  India’s  contribution  to  the  mobile  research  and  understand  in  what  areas  of  mobile  research  India  has  made  signifcant  contribution and progress over time and how good has been the  quality of its research output in mobile research. 
1.1 Literature  Review 
Till date, no study has been reported at the national level  on quantitative and qualitative analysis of mobile research in  India during the last two decades. However, a few quantitative  studies  analysing  publication  output  were  reported  covering  some  of  the  subfelds  of  mobile  research,  namely  mobile  research4,  mobile  technology5,  mobile  computing6-8,  mobile  commerce9-10, mobile learning11-14, mobile payments15-16, mobile  banking17,  etc.  Given  the  fact  that  no  study  was  available  particular  at  national  level  on  mobile  research,  the  authors,  therefore, decided to undertake the present study. 
2.  ObjectIveS 
The main objectives of this study are to study India’s status  of performance in mobile research during 2007-2016, based  on publications covered in Scopus database. In particular, the  study focuses on the following objectives:  
• Comparative  growth  of  India  and  the  world  on  mobile  
research, ascertain India’s global share and determine the  
citation impact of the Indian research output 
• National share of international collaborative papers in the  
country output and the contribution of important foreign  
countries in India’s international collaborative papers • To  analyse  research  output  by  broad  subject  areas  and  
study the growth pattern across subjects over time • Citation impact of top 20 most productive organisations  
and authors and compare their the publication productivity  
trends 
• To study the medium of research communication  • To study the characteristics of top highly cited papers on  
mobile research in India. 
3.  MethOdOLOgy 
The study identifed, retrieved and downloaded the global  and Indian publication data on mobile research from the Scopus  citation database for 10 years during 2007-2016. A well -defned  search  strategy  was  formulated  which  uses  the  search  term  ‘mobile*’ in the two tags, namely ‘keyword tag’ and ‘Article  Title  tag’  and  restricting  it  to  the  period  2007-2016  in  ‘date  range tag’ was used for searching the global publication data.  The search has resulted into 2,21,563 global publications on  mobile-related research. When this search string was restricted  to India in ‘country tag’, as shown below, the publication data  on  India’s  mobile-related  research  was  obtained,  resulting  in  13,021  publications.  By  using  analytical  provisions/  tags  
42 
available in Scopus database such as ‘subject area tag’, ‘country  tag’, ‘source title tag’, ‘journal title name’ and ‘affliation tag’,  etc. – the Indian publications output was accordingly refned  by subject, collaborating countries, organisation-wise, author- wise  and  journal-wise,  etc.  For  citation  data,  citations  to  publications were also collected from date of publication till  16 December 2016. The Indian publications data was analysed  across  a  series  of  raw  and  relative  bibliometric  indicators  with a view to understand the dynamics of Indian research in  mobile-related research. A complete counting method, wherein  every contributing author or organisation covered in multiple  authorship papers was fully counted was used. All authors or  organisations  to  multi-authored  papers  have  received  equal  credit in data counting and analysis.

Mobile networks is India’s most preferred area of research  in  mobile  world  accounting  for  the  largest  share  (53.19  %)  to  the  national  output  on  mobile  research.  The  other  areas  of  mobile  research  in  India  are  mobile  telecommunication  systems,  mobile  communication,  and  mobile  security,  etc.  but  with  insignifcant  contributions.  Mobile  applications  --  like  mobile  banking,  mobile  payments,  mobile  commerce,  mobile  health,  and  mobile  education  –are  still  not  the  top

priority of research of the country. The top 20 most productive  organisations in India in mobile research account for just 25.64  per cent share in the national output. These top organisations  are still not contributing signifcantly and fail to give India a  leading edge in the world mobile research. India’s world share  to  mobile  research  is  just  5.88  per  cent.  In  10  years,  India  could  contribute  only  14  highly  cited  papers  out  of  a  total  of  13021  publications  that  the  country  published  on  mobile  research during 2007-2016. In sum, despite its IT dominance,  India  is  still  not  a  leading  country  in  the  world  on  mobile  research both in terms of quantity and quality of research. In  view of its growing global importance of mobile research, it is  imperative for India to develop a strategy to increase research  output, improve research quality and give more emphasis on  international collaboration. The Indian Government needs to  identify this area as one of the national priority area, involving  much  larger  R&D  investments  and  trained  manpower  and  also increase international collaboration with leading mobile  research hubs.
