ResearchGate is an academic social network site designed primarily for scholars to create their own profles,  upload their scholarly work, and communicate among peers. The present study explores the motives, activities  and beneft researcher seek or gain from joining ResearchGate academic social network. The result of the study  indicates that ResearchGate is popular among research scholars in Pondicherry University. The motive of joining  ResearchGate by scholar are many, however, majority of the scholars agrees that joining ResearchGate enable them  to connect with people who have similar interests. Similarly, majority of the scholars stated that the main activity  they involve themselves besides many activities in ResearchGate is reading articles and reviewing paper posted by  others. Finally, ResearchGate has enhanced their ability to stay abreast with new/latest developments in their feld  of research. However, seeking employments using ResearchGate is the least research scholars anticipate.

1.  IntRodUctIon 
The Internet, particularly world wide web has changed all  walks of life in creating and sharing information in the online  environment. The research community of any discipline is not  exceptional. The term academic social networking service is  used  as  a  broad  term  referring  to  an  online  service,  tool,  or  platform  that  can  help  scholars  to  build  their  professional  networks  with  other  researchers  and  facilitate  their  various  activities  when  conducting  research.  Gewin3   explains  is  an  offshoot of facebook, an effort for scientist’s eager to develop a  network focused on shared research interests. Some well-known  examples  of  ASNSs  include  ResearchGate.net1,  Academia. edu2, Mendeley.com, and Zotero.org. According to Jeng26, et al. academic social networking sites (ASNSs) provide a platform  that allows users to create profles with academic properties,  upload their publications, and create online groups. These sites  have included communication and dissemination by integrating  a repository for scholastic publications within a social network  site for researchers to share3-6. Presently, there is an increasing  popularity of the social web and network technology resulting  to more and more scholars joining online research communities.  Krause7  is of the view that academic social networking services  help in maintaining records of current research trends and more  importantly  build  up  the  relationship  with  the  professionals.  Moreover,  sharing  of  scholastic  literature  using  academic  greatly increases their visibility among the peer group. Metric  such  as  alternative  metrics,  article  level  metrics  have  also  recognised the importance of social networking site inclusion  to  evaluate  research  impact.  Hence,  scholars  are  taking  the

advantage of social networking sites designed specifcally for  scholars to enhance their visibility, connect and share. 
2.  LIteRAtURe  RevIew 
In  recent  years  there  has  been  an  increasing  popularity  among  scholars  to  share  their  research  electronically  using  various social networking tools. Specialised academic social  networking sites are one such tool scholars use to share their  scholarly  articles8.  Since  scientist  are  often  pressured  to  publish to survive, and while doing so, they are expected to  conduct thorough literature reviews for their research project  and cite the relevant literature. According to Vom Brocke9, the  importance of literature searching is such that there have been  calls for the search steps to be documented in academic articles.  However, Dickersin10, et al.  states that it is almost impossible  to  achieve  complete  literature.  Often,  with  the  information  explosion  and  the  lack  of  accessibility,  scholars  use  various  methods in order to identify and acquire relevant research11-12.  Traditionally, Librarian has made all effort to provide access to  all the literature through institutional subscription and library  consortia13.  However,  these  scholarly  subscriptions  may  not  satisfy  all  the  literature  required  to  complete  the  research.  Besides all the effort, a scholar may not provide all the relevant  literature needed for the research, hence, the researcher may  decide  to  exclude  papers  for  which  it  is  diffcult  to  obtain  full-text  copies  of  similar  article  that  are  readily  available6.  As  a  result  of  which,  social  media  network  and  academic  social networking sites such as Mendeley, ResearchGate, and  Academia.edu have been popular among scholars to share and  access scholarly articles14. Since, sharing according to Tenopir14,  et al. is intrinsic to scholarship’ and scholars will continue to  share their research work no matter the consequence.

SINGSON  & A MEES : PERCEIVE  M OTIVES, ACTIVITIES, AND  B ENEFITS OF USING  R ESEARCHGATE By RESEARCH  S CHOLARS 
Ever since its recent establishment, little-known research  has investigated the structure, mechanism, and use of academic  SNS  among  research  scholars. Academic  social  networking  sites, like Academia.edu and ResearchGate serve the academic  audience to ‘(a) construct a public or semi-public profle within  a bounded system, (b) articulate a list of other users with whom  they share a connection, and (c) view and traverse their list of  connections and those made by others within the system’20  and  include  additional  functions,  such  as  uploading  and  sharing  articles,  endorsing  colleagues,  or  fnding  literature6,19,21.  ResearchGate, users can create a personal profle with academic  information,  share  publications  and  data  sets,  engage  in  discussions, up/down vote publications and discussion topics,  write messages, search for and monitor peers as well as their  own  impact  via  the  ResearchGate  score22.  However,  Gewin3 critics that it has none emerged as a ‘go-to’ system. 
In a study conducted by Chakraborty15  in North Eastern  Hill  University,  the  popularity  of  ResearchGate  is  confned  to just a few scholars, while a few scholars from the science  discipline  does  not  fnd  academic  social  networking  site  scholarly.  Similarly,  Thelwall6,  et  al.   fndings  indicated  the  popularity  of  ResearchGate  among  users  from  Brazil,  India  and Iran and countries such as France, Spain, the Netherlands,  Brazil,  and  Sweden  all  have  relatively  high  ResearchGate  scores.  According  to  them,  developing  countries  are  taking  advantage of ResearchGate based solely on the membership.  Similarly,  Hammook16,  et  al.  study  on  the  collaboration  of  Canadian Computer Science Scientist in ResearchGate provided  evidence of collaboration in ResearchGate with collaboration  mechanisms such as questions and answers being extensively  used16.  
yu17,  et al. investigated the effectiveness of ResearchGate  
score  at  the  researcher  level  by  comparing  the  correlation  
between ResearchGate score and FWCI of SciVal. The result  
of their fnding suggests that RG score is an effective indicator  
at the individual level 
17. Various studies have been conducted to  
validate the reliability of ResearchGate metric as an alternative  
metric beyond download counts14,18,19 . Based on a case study  conducted  by  Hoffmann 
19,  et  al.  
among  a  sample  of  Swiss  management  scholars,  they  analyse  how  centrality  measures  
derived  from  the  participants’  interactions  on  the  academic  
SNS. The study indicates that, ‘platform engagement, seniority,  
and publication impact contribute to members’ in degree and  
eigenvector centrality on the platform, but less so to closeness  
or  betweenness.  Using  a  mixed  methods  approach,  Jeng 
23,  et  al.   collected  and  grouped  413  posts  across  three  distinct  interfaces  of  ResearchGate’s  communication  platform  and  
found that scholars were politer in the initial group discussion  interface  but  user  interface  design  did  not  change  the  core  communication patterns of sharing information and opinions  among scholars. Similar studies were also conducted on Arab  students  by  Elsayed24,  the  study  reveals  that  three-quarters  of the respondents use ASNs to share publications, and most  researchers  subscribed  to  more  than  one  ASN,  however  RG  was  the  most  frequently  used  one. The  fndings  of  the  study show that academic discipline appears to play a role  in defning Arab researchers within RG, as the majority of  them were from the pure and applied sciences. Also, Ameez  
and Singson25  conducted Pondicherry University institutional  contribution  in  ResearchGate  account  and  found  that  there  was a correlation between citations and downloads. 
3.    o bjectIveS 
The objectives of the study are as follows: 
(i)     Investigate  the  level  of  awareness  on  SNSs  among  the  
research scholars of Pondicherry University 
(ii)     Find  out  the  perceived  motives  of  research  scholars  of  
Pondicherry University in joining ResearchGate.  (iii)     Find  out  the  various  activities  performed  by  the  
research  scholars  of  Pondicherry  University  through  
ResearchGate. 
(iv)     Explore  the  various  benefts  research  scholars  have  
garnered by using ResearchGate. 
4.  MethodoLoGy 
For  the  present  study  simple  random  sample  was  use  to  select  140  user  having  accounts  in  ResearchGate.  The  respondents  were  self-administered  with  closed  ended  questionnaire  consisting  of  two  section.  The  frst  section  consisted of questions regarding personal information while  the second section consist multiple choice question and three  table of 26 question which measured respondents’ attitudes  using likert scale. Questions in the table were concerned with  the user’s motive of joining ResearchGate as well as current  activities  and  benefts  of  using  ResearchGate.  From  the  140  questionnaire  distributed,  only  100  questionnaire  were  deemed ft for analysis. Finally, MS-Excel 2016 software was  used to analyse the collected data. The descriptive statistics  were represented using percentage and graphic to provide a  general picture of ResearchGate use by research scholars in  Pondicherry University. 
5.  ReSULtS And dIScUSSIon 
In  total,  100  research  scholar  responded  to  the  questionnaire, therefore, the analyses in this section are based  on the 100 completed response. As shown in Table 1, majority  (79%) are male and 21 females (21%). 60% respondents are  from the science discipline followed by social science with just  40 respondents.  
The  frequency  of  ResearchGate  use,  as  represented  in  Table 1 indicates that 21 respondents visited their accounts on  a daily basis, while 21 respondents visited their account on an  alternate basis, 43 respondents visited their account weekly, 8  of them accessed fortnightly and 7 of them accessed the site at  least once per month. Out of total 100 respondent’, majority  (40%)  of  the  respondents  stated  that  they  have  been  using  ResearchGate for more than 3 year, 27% stated about 27-36  month, 19% for just 6-12 month and 14% respondent stated  just 6 month.  
The study also shows that 95% of respondents are aware of  full-text sharing of research article via ResearchGate platform,  whereas only 5% of the population are unaware of this service.  From  the  95%  population  aware  of  sharing  service,  77%  population are satisfed, 11% population are very satisfed, 4%  neutral, 2% dissatisfed, and 1% very dissatisfed. In addition,  Table  1  also  shows  that  majority  of  the  respondents  (57%)

Overall,  the  results  of  the  present  study  indicate  that  researcher  motive  of  joining  ResearchGate was to gain visibility and communicate with  fellow researchers. 
5.3  Activities  of  ResearchGate  Members 
Table 3 shows different activities research scholars were  engaged  in  ResearchGate.  Findings  of  the  study  show  that  the  main  activities  research  scholar  on  ResearchGate  was  to  read  articles  and  review  paper  posted  by  research  peers  (Mean score = 1.98). Followed by researcher requesting an  article  that  was  not  accessible  to  them  in  their  university  (Mean  score  =  2.07).  Closely  followed  by  activity  such  as  posting their research article papers and reading comments  and reviews on their research publication with a mean score  of  2.20  were  also  considered  an  important  practice  by  the  researcher on ResearchGate. Other activities include sending  their papers to fellow ResearchGate users on request (Mean

5.4   b enefit  Researcher  have  Gained  using  
ResearchGate 
The beneft researcher seeks while joining ResearchGate  is as shown in Table 4. From the result of the study, research  scholars stated that joining ResearchGate has enhanced their  ability to stay abreast of new/latest developments in their feld  of research (Mean score = 1.890) and it has also enabled them  to contact fellow researcher from their home institution (Mean  score = 1.98). Other reasons research scholars stated was that  ‘It has enabled them to share their research article using this  platform’ (Mean score = 2.050), enhanced the quantity of their  scholarly work. (Mean score = 2.060), enhance their citation  count (Mean score = 2.270), and their visibility (Mean score  = 2.280). However, the majority of the research scholar stated  that  joining  ResearchGate  has  not  enhanced  their  research  performance. 
6.    dIS cUSSIon And concLUSIonS 
In this study, we examined the research scholars’ various  motivation factors, activities and beneft for joining an online  research community in an academic social networking service  - ResearchGate. To the best of our knowledge, investigation on  user’s attitude toward ResearchGate proved to be fruitful. Since

it has explored upon the various motives, activities, and benefts  research scholars seek to achieve while using ResearchGate.  In  line  Chakraborty15,  fndings  of  the  study  suggest  that  ResearchGate  is  very  popular  among  research  scholar,  particularly among the science disciplines. However, the much- needed motivation or awareness of ResearchGate among social  science and humanities was not observed. Otherwise, overall  research  scholar  motivation  of  joining  ResearchGate  was  to  connect, gain visibility and follow fellow researcher. Activities  while using ResearchGate includes article upload, commenting,  reading and reviewing. In addition, research scholar request for  article that is not available in their institution. Finally, research  scholar beneft of joining ResearchGate are multifaceted, such  as visibility, accessibility, collaboration, and most importantly  an  update  to  the  latest  research.  However,  research  scholars  have provided no evidence to suggest that using ResearchGate  have enhanced their research performance. Overall, research  scholars are indeed utilizing ResearchGate to their advantage  in which sharing is one of the core activity. Besides, sharing is  intrinsic to scholarship and self-promotion and will continue  regardless of the publisher’s restriction and embargoes. More  importantly,  the  advent  of  technology  and  social  media  has  made sharing much easier now14. Therefore, if publishers do not  recognise the changing landscape of scholarly communication,  they may be left behind14. 
This  study  provides  the  foundation  for  further  research  into  research  scholars’  collaborative  endeavour,  sharing  behaviours  particularly  the  differences  between  sharing  one’s  own  and  others  scholarly  work  and  attitude.  More  importantly,  ResearchGate  metric  score  has  been  subject  to  numerous  studies.  Though  ResearchGate  metric  is  yet  to  establish  itself  as  a  credibility  evaluation  metric  among  scholarly community, it is gaining momentums by reinventing  itself  as  a  social  impact  measurement.  However,  large  scale  relationship  study  between  ResearchGate  metrics,  establish  metrics and institutional metrics have not been undertaken in  India.  Therefore,  validating  the  credibility  of  ResearchGate  score  at  institutional  level  by  comparing  it  with  established  measurement  such  as  The  National  Institutional  Ranking  Framework, Web of Science, SciValor Scopus would contribute  immensely into the scientifc community and ResearchGate in  particular.
