An analysis of 2428 papers indexed by Indian citation Index during 2004-2015 indicate that the pattern of  growth of Indian library and information science literature has been highly inconsistent with highest number of  papers published in 2010. Academic institutions contributed about 86% of papers. Prolifc institutions contributed  about 44% of the output, with Mysore University topping the list closely followed by University of Delhi. However,  highest impact as refected by citation per paper was made by CSIR-NISTADS and CSIR-NISCAIR. B.M. Gupta  of CSIR-NISTADS topped the list, but highest CPP was for K.C.Garg of the same institute. SRELS Journal of  Information Management published the highest number of papers and the area of bibliometrics and scientometrics  
was the area of priority of LIS professionals in India.

1. IntroductIon 
Modern day library and information science research  in India is more than a century old. In independent India,  library  schools  developed  significantly  with  pioneering  efforts  of  Dr.  S.R.  Ranganathan  which  made  him  'the  father of Library Science in India'. His efforts introduced  formal education and research in library and information  science  at  the  University  of  Madras,  Bombay,  Banaras,  Delhi,  etc.  Delhi  University  was  the  first  university  in  India which offered facilities for research in the area of  Library  and  Information  Science  (LIS),  leading  to  PhD  degree,  under  the  supervision  of  Dr.  S.R.  Ranganathan.  Thereafter,  other  universities  in  the  country  introduced  facilities  for  research  in  library  science.  
Outside  the  conventional  university  system;  two  institutes  of  national  importance  offered  education  and  research  in  the  field  of  LIS.  These  are  Documentation  Research and Training Centre (DRTC), Bangalore and the  erstwhile Indian National Scientific Documentation Centre  (INSDOC) presently CSIR-National Institute of Science  Communication and Information Resources (CSIR-NISCAIR),  New  Delhi.  So,  the  past  of  library  and  information  science  in  India  has  been  rich  and  is  regarded  as  an  important  discipline  and  now  seems  fully  developed. 
Despite the rise in the number of institutions imparting  LIS  education  and  research  and  India's  well  known  capabilities  in  ICT  and  its  application  in  libraries  and  information  centers,  only  an  analysis  of  India's  LIS  research  contributions  will  enable  us  to  understand  its  strengths and capabilities. The present bibliometric study  is  an  attempt  in  that  direction.  The  study  is  based  on  
Received 13 February 2017, online published 09 May 2017 
the  19  LIS  journals  indexed  by  Indian  Citation  Index  (ICI)  during  the  period  2004-2015.  
2.   t he  IndIAn cItAtIon  Index  (IcI) 
The  Indian  Citation  Index  (ICI)  was  launched  in  October  2009  by  The  Knowledge  Foundation  with  the  requisite support of M/s DIVA ENTERPRISES Pvt. Ltd.  The  database  exclusively  focuses  on  Indian  scholarly  literature  in  the  discipline  of  science  and  technology,  social sciences and humanities. The database fulfilled the  long  time  demand  of  Indian  scholars  for  an  evaluative  tool that could help in measuring the contributions made  by  Indian  scholars  in  several  scholarly  disciplines.  
The  temporal  range  of  records  ranges  from  2004  to  present.  As  of  20th   October,  2016,  ICI  had  indexed  545,677 articles, and a staggering 10,119,380 references  from 950 publications. It indexes research articles, reviews,  editorials, short communication, research notes, case studies,  research methods, opinion papers, patents, standards and  proceeding  papers  etc.  Other  useful  byproducts  of  the  database are Indian Science Citation Index, Indian Social  Science  Citation  Index,  Humanities  Citation  Index  and  Indian  Journals  Citation  Report,  etc.  ICI  website  also  provides extensive search and analytical features. ICI is  a  specialised  information  product  and  is  an  invaluable  tool  for  researchers,  policy  makers,  editor  of  journals  and  librarians. 
3.   oB jectIveS 
The  study  has  the  following  objectives: 
(a) Examine the pattern of growth of the research publications  
output  in  the  discipline  of  LIS  during  2004-2015 

========1========

DJLIT, VOL.  37,  NO.  3, MAy  2017 
(b) Examine  the  distribution  of  output  by  performing  
sectors  like  academic  institutions  and  government  
funded  R&D  organisations    
(c) Identify the most prolific research institutions in the  
field  of  LIS  in  India  and  their  citation  impact; (d) Identify  the  most  prolific  Indian  authors  and  the  
citation  impact  of  their  research  output 
(e) Identify  the  most  preferred  journals  used  for  
communicating  research  results 
(f) Examine the pattern of citations and to identify the  
highly  cited  papers. 
4.   r eSeArch  Methodo Logy 
The  data  for  the  study  was  downloaded  from  the  website of Indian Citation Index available at http://www. indiancitationindex.com/on May 1, 2016 by searching for  the records related to ‘library and information science’ in  ‘subject categories by setting the time period 2004-2015.  The search resulted in 3008 records. These records were  saved  and  imported  to  MS  Excel  2007.  The  data  was  further  refined  and  document  types  like  editorials  (65),  reports (1), proceedings paper (1),  articles not published  from  India  (505),  and  8  documents  that  could  not  be  classified  as  either  of  the  above  were  discarded.  Thus,  a  total  of  2428  records  were  left  and  were  analysed  to  meet the above mentioned objectives. Each downloaded  record contained name of the authors with their affiliation,  name  of  the  source  journal  and  the  number  of  times  cited. Complete count method has been used for counting  author citations, which has an inherent limitation that it  over-weighs  authors  of  multiple-authored  papers. 
5. LIMItAtIonS 
(a) Some  fields  like  ‘times  cited’  are  not  up  to  date  
that  the  highest  number  (208)  papers  were  published  in  1999  and  thereafter,  a  gradual  decline  was  observed  in  the  research  output.  In  another  study,  Barik  &  Jena2 analysed the annual growth of LIS research publications  in India using Scopus database for the period 2004-2013.  Authors  found  that  the  highest  and  lowest  number  of  articles were indexed in 2013 (20.7%) and 2005 (1.9%)  respectively,  and  the  yearly  average  annual  growth  rate  was  16.5%. Two  authored  papers  dominated  the  pattern  of  authorship.  Kademani  &  Kumar  were  identified  as  most  prolific  authors.  The  journal   Library  Philosophy  and  Practice   was  identified  as  the  most  used  journal  for  publishing  research  results.  The  researchers  also  found  that  author  productivity  did  not  follow  Lotka’s  law. Maharana & Das3   did  a  similar  study  in  which  the  authors  analysed  the  growth  and  development  of  LIS  research  carried  out  by  Indian  researchers  based  on  the  publications  indexed  in  Social  Science  Citation  Index (SSCI) during the period 1999-2013. Authors found that  2010  and  2000  to  be  most  and  least  productive  years  respectively.  
Analyses  of  productivity  by  authors  found  that  273  authors  contributed  a  total  of  140  publications  with  an  average  of  1.95  authors  per  publication  and  0.5  papers  per  author.  The  authors  also  concluded  that  author  productivity  did  not  follow  the  Lotka’s  law.  In  a  study  Mittal4   attempted  to  trace  the  research  trends  in  LIS  in  India during January 1990-June 2010 as reflected through  articles  abstracted  in LISA.  Co-word  analysis  was  used  to  identify  the  core  research  areas  by  quantifying  the  frequency of occurrence and the analysis of co-occurrence  of 4735 descriptors assigned to 1408 articles. The author  used  the  Kamada-Kawai  algorithm  for  constructing  the  network of relations between descriptors and making spatial  distribution  of  these.  The  results  of  co-word  analysis

  6.   r evIew  of  LIterAture 
Several  studies  have  been  published  in  literature  that  dealt  with  bibliometric  aspects  of  research  in  LIS.  However,  none  of  these  studies  have  used  the  Indian  Citation Index as the source for data. For instance, Patra  &  Chand1     analysed  LIS  research  literature  emanating  from  India  based  on  the  data  abstracted  in  Library  and  Information  Science  Abstracts  ( LISA)  from  1967  to  2004.  Authors  found  that  most  of  the  articles  were  written  by  a  single  author  and  the  author  productivity  followed  Lotka’s  law.  Herald  of  Library  Science   was  the  most  prolific  journal  and  late  professor  P.N.  Kaula  was  the  most  prolific  contributor.  The  study  also  found

results also suggest that there exist substantial activities  in  digitisation,  digital  libraries  and  Web  2.0.  Qadri  &  Khan5   analysed the development of Indian LIS literature  for  the  period  of  Pre  1990s  to  Post  1990s. The  data  for  this study was collected from the online LISA database.  The  study  showed  that  there  is  more  interest  in  modern  subject areas like information technology, bibliometrics,  electronic resources, knowledge management, and library  automation  rather  than  in  traditional  subject  areas  like  classification, cataloguing, indexing, documentation and  library services etc. This study identified S.R. Ranganathan,  P.  Perumal  and  A.  Neelameghan  as  the  most  prolific  authors in the pre-1990s era, while V. Venkatappaiah, P.N.  Kaula, and I.N. Sengupta were the most prolific authors  in the post 1990s era. Single authored papers dominated  the  authorship  pattern. The  most  common  journals  used  for  publishing  research  results  were  IASLIC  Bulletin,  Bulletin  of  Indian  Library  Association,  Granthalokam,  Granthagar, and Herald of Library Science prior to 1990s  and SRELS Journal of Information Management,  Annals  of Library and Information Studies and the  International

GARG  &  SHARMA: BIBLIOMETRICS OF  L IBRARy AND  I NFORMATION  S CIENCE RESEARCH IN  I NDIA DURING  2004-2015 
Journal of Library and Information Science  were the most  productive  journal  until  2011.  Pradhan  &  Chandrakar6 presented a bibliometric analysis of Indian LIS literature  published  in  foreign  journals  using  the  online  version  of Social  Science  Citation  Index   database  for  a  period  of  2000-2009.  
The researchers found that out of the total of 21,197  articles, only 228 were contributed by Indian authors. The  volume of published literature by Indian authors was found  to be increasing steadily during the period of study with  the highest number (38) publications in 2009 followed by  33  papers  in  2008. A  journal  wise  distribution  analysis  was  also  conducted  and  the  journal Scientometrics   was  found  to  be  the  most  used  journal  with  61  publications  followed by E-Library   with  36  publications. This  study  also  analysed  authorship  patterns  and  found  that  there  were  a  total  of  467  authors  publishing  228  papers,  and  that  papers  with  two  authors  were  the  most  common  followed  by  single  authored  papers.  
7.   r eSuLtS And  dIScuSSIon 
7.1. Pattern  of growth  of  Indian  LIS  Literature  
During  2004-2015,  LIS  professionals  from  India  published  2428  papers.  The  pattern  of  output  and  the  annual  rate  of  growth  of  the  output  of  Indian  LIS  
and  in  rest  of  the  years  the  growth  rate  is  lower  than  the  CAGR.  
7.2.  d istribution  of output  by  Performing  Sectors 
Like  scientific  research,  several  agencies  like  academic  institutions  (universities  and  colleges),  and  library  professionals  at  the  institutes  of  higher  learning  like  Indian  Institutes  of  Technology  (IITs)  are  involved  in  LIS  research.  Besides  these,  professionals  at  several  government funded laboratories under the aegis of Council  of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of  Atomic Energy (DAE), Department of Space (DOS), Indian  Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Indian Council of  Agriculture Research including State Agriculture Universities  (ICAR),  Department  of  Science  and  Technology  (DST)  and  Defence  Research  and  Development  Organisation  (DRDO)  are  also  engaged  in  LIS  research. Analysis  of  the downloaded data indicates that like scientific research  academic  institutions  topped  the  list  with  86.1%  of  the  output  followed  by  CSIR.  Next  in  output  ranked  were  IITs, closely followed by DRDO. Total share of research  institutions  were  a  distant  second  only  with  11.5%  of  the  total  publications.  This  is  because  research  in  the  discipline of LIS is not on the mandate of most research  institutions under different scientific agencies, except two  institutions namely CSIR-NIATADS and CSIR-NISCAIR.  
literature  are  depicted  in  Fig.  1.  It  indicates  a  rising  
These two institutions work in the area of scientometrics,  
a  sub-discipline  of  LIS  research.  However,  most  of  the  
trend of output during 2005 to 2008 with a steep dip in  the year 2009. A gradual decline has been observed from  2010 onward till 2015 with a slight increase in 2013 and  with  highest  number  of  papers  in  2010.  Similar  results  have  been  observed  by  Barik  &  Jena2   who  studied  the  growth of LIS literature in India during 2004-2013 using  the  Scopus  database. 
  The  annual  rate  of  growth  is  highly  inconsistent  and  has  fluctuated  during  the  period  of  study.  The  highest  rate  of  growth  was  observed  for  the  year  2007  and  the  lowest  rate  of  growth  was  for  the  year  2015.  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) calculated  by  using  the  formula  available  at  http://cagrcalculator. net/result/  was  found  to  be  4.0%  during  the  period  of  study.  During  the  period  of  study  (2004-2015)  growth  rate  is  more  than  CAGR  in  2006-2008,  2010  and  2013

presents the distribution of output by prolific institutions  along  with  the  citations  these  papers  received  and  the  values  of  Citation  per  Paper  (CPP).  CPP  is  a  relative  indicator  computed  as  the  average  number  of  citations  per paper. It has been widely used in bibliometric studies  to  normalise  a  large  disparity  in  volumes  of  published  output  among  disciplines,  countries  and  institutions  for  a  meaning  full  comparison  of  research  impact. 
 Only those institutes have been considered as prolific  which  published  25  or  more  papers  during  the  period  of  study.  The  share  of  20  most  prolific  institutions  was  1080 (44.5%) of the total Indian research output in LIS  and  the  remaining  (55.5%)  papers  were  published  by  406  institutions  located  in  different  parts  of  India. This  indicates  that  the  output  in  the  field  of  LIS  is  highly  concentrated  among  only  a  few  institutions.  Further  analysis of data indicates that of the 20 institutions listed  in  Table  2  most  are  academic  institutions,  except  two  which  are  funded  by  CSIR.  The  highest  number  (110)

research papers were contributed by University of Mysore  closely  followed  by  University  of  Delhi. 
Citation  analysis  of  the  published  papers  indicates  that  these  papers  received  1364  citations.  The  CPP  for  the  entire  output  was  0.56.  Of  the  listed  20  prolific  institutions, the CPP for 15 institutions was either equal  or  more  than  the  average  CPP  for  all  the  papers.  The  value  of  CPP  was  less  than  average  CPP  for  University  of  Delhi,  Anna  University,  Visvesvaraya  Technological  University,  Manonmaniam  Sundaranar  University  and  Bharathidasan University. The value of CPP was highest  for  CSIR-National  Institute  of  Science, Technology  and  Development Studies (CSIR-NISTADS) closely followed  by  CSIR-NISCAIR.  The  value  of  CPP  for  these  two  institutes  was  about  four  times  the  average  CPP. 
7.4. Most  Prolific  Indian Authors 
During the period of the study 2247 Indian authors  contributed to 2428 papers in Indian LIS journals indexed  by the Indian Citation Index . Generally in a given subject,  most  authors  publish  only  a  few  articles  whereas  a  few  prolific authors publish many articles. The discipline of  LIS is no different. Table 3 lists 19 most prolific Indian  authors  according  to  the  number  of  publications  they  have  made  during  2004-2012.  
It  is  generally  believed  that  prolific  authors  get  more  citations  as  compared  to  non  prolific  authors.  A  look  at  the  number  of  citations  received  indicates  that  authors  with  more  publications  do  not  necessarily  have  more citations. Surprisingly, four of the prolific authors  received  less  than  five  citations,  the  lowest  being  for  C.K. Sharma with zero citation. This low citation count  may,  however,  be  the  result  of  flaws  in  Indian  Citation  Index’s  citation  counting  methodology.  For  example,  the  Indian  Citation  Index  shows  14  citations  for  a  2006  article titled: ‘Scientometric profile of Indian science as  seen  through Science  Citation  Index ’  authored  by  K.C.  Garg,  whereas  Google  Scholar  shows  24  citations  for  the  same  article.  Quick  analyses  of  all  Google  Scholar  citations  for  this  article  reveal  that  all  citations  come  from  Indian  authors,  and  all  but  one  citation  is  from  2015  or  before.  Therefore,  the  Indian  Citation  Index  should  show  at  least  23  citations  for  this  paper,  but  it  does  not.  Similar  discrepancies  exist  between  citation  counts  for  other  articles  by  other  authors.  
Over the course of 12 years, B.M. Gupta received the  highest number of citations (58), followed by K.C. Garg  (42).  Although,  since  the  number  of  citations  received  depend  on  the  number  of  papers  that  an  author  has  published, the value of citations per paper (CPP) would  be a more accurate measure of impact. The value of CPP  for  different  authors  listed  in  Table  4  shows  that  K.C.  Garg has the highest citations per paper (2.47) followed by  B.M. Gupta with 1.87. Among all the authors L.S.R.C.V.  Ramesh  and  C.K.  Sharma  had  the  lowest  citations  per  paper  (0.06  and  0.0  respectively).

  there  are  around  130  LIS  journals  being  published  from  India.  The  Indian  Citation  Index  indexed  only  19  journals  published  from  India  in  the  field  of  Library  and  Information  Science.  There  is  always  pressure  on  professionals  to  publish  in  the best journals. Table 4 lists the top 10 journals where  the research results were published. The SRELS Journal  of  Information  Management   published  by  the  Sarada  Ranganathan  Endowment  for  Library  Science  (founded  by  Dr.  S.R.  Ranganathan  in  1961)  tops  the  list  with  391(16.10%) publications, while the   DESIDOC  Journal  of Library and Information Technology (DJLIT)  published  by  Defense  Scientific  Information  &  Documentation  Centre (DESIDOC), is a distant second with 290(11.94%)  
publications.  KELPRO  Bulletin,  being  published  since  1997 by the Kerala Library Professional’s Organisation,  was  the  last  on  the  list  with  93  (3.83  %)  publications  during  the  period  of  this  study.  
All  of  the  journals  featured  in  Table  4  are  peer  reviewed,  and  most  of  them  provide  subscription  based  access, except two i.e. Annals of Library and Information  Studies  and  DJLIT,  which  are  open  access  and  are  also  indexed  by  SCOPUS  database.  Further  analysis  of  data  indicate that the top 5 journals together published more  than  half  (56%)  of  all  publications.  This  suggests  that  subscription to the ten journals mentioned in Table 4 should  be enough to provide a cheap and effective coverage of  Library and Information Science literature originating from India.  table 4.

7.6.  d istribution  of output  by  Sub-disciplines 
It  is  always  interesting  to  know  the  distribution  of  articles  published  in  a  subject  by  their  sub-disciplines.  This informs us about the current ‘hot topics’ for research  as well as bring to our notice those subject areas which  are  lagging  behind  and  where  more  research  is  needed.  Table  5  depicts  the  number  of  papers  dealing  with  each  sub-discipline  along  with  the  corresponding  number  of  papers  and  their  percentages.  Since  a  single  research  article  can  deal  with  many  subjects  simultaneously,  the  percentage  column  does  not  add  up  to  100. The  subject  of  Bibliometrics/Scientometrics    seems  to  be  the  most  popular amongst LIS researchers with 850 (35%) papers  during the period of study. Bibliometrics has always been  a  popular  research  subject  see  Mittal4,  perhaps  because  these  days  it  is  relatively  easy  to  get  bibliographic  data  and to perform various bibliometric analysis. The subject  of ‘User studies’ was a distant second with 303(12.47%)  publications, followed by ‘Information Technology’ with  289(11.9%)  publications.  The  least  popular  subject  was  ‘Information  Consolidation  and  Repackaging’  with  only  4(0.16%)  papers,  which  is  surprising  considering  the  significance  of  this  subject  in  a  modern  information

society. The subject of ‘Serials Control’ with only 6(0.24%)  papers  also  requires  some  attention.  The  distribution  of  output  by  its  sub-disciplines  was  done  automatically  on  the  Indian  Citation  Index ’s  website  using  the  subject  category  feature  (still  in  Beta  phase).  One  only  need  to  input  the  broad  subject  and  the  time  frame,  and  the  website automatically presents a list of sub fields under  that  broad  subject  along  with  the  number  of  articles  under  each  sub  field.  Such  tools  are  of  immense  help  for  researchers  and  are  greatly  appreciated.  
7.6. Pattern  of citations  
The publication data was subjected to an examination  of  citations  received  by  the  papers.  Table  6  depicts  the  distribution  of  papers  by  citations  these  received.  It  is  observed  that  of  the  2428  papers  about  three-forth  (73.8%) of the papers did not get any citation. Rest 635  papers  were  cited  one  or  more  times.  Of  them  only  a  minuscule  were  cited  more  than  10  times.  Table  7  lists  papers  which  were  cited  10  or  more  times.

7.7.  h ighly cited  Papers 
Scholars in different disciplines have different citation  practices. Hence, the average number of citations received  by a paper varies from field to field. Like other disciplines  in  social  sciences,  Library  and  Information  Science  papers tend to have fewer citations8  compared to natural  sciences like physics and chemistry, or medical and life  sciences. Analysis  of  highly  cited  papers  reveals  that  a  large majority of such papers dealt with the sub-discipline  of  bibliometrics  or  scientometrics.  
This  is  not  surprising  considering  the  fact  that  bibliometrics  is  and  has  been  the  most  active  area  of  research within the LIS field.  A list of top 12 most cited  articles  is  presented  in Table  7.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that of the top 12 most cited papers, seven were published  in the journal Annals of  Library and Information Studies (ALIS) published by CSIR-NISCAIR, four in  DESIDOC  Journal of Library and Information Technology  ( DJLIT)  published  by  DESIDOC  and  one  in  Library  Herald published  by  Delhi  Library Association.  
8.   c oncLuSIonS 
Based on the analyses of 2428 papers, indexed in the  Indian Citation Index for the period of 12 years (2004- 2015) it was found that the pattern of output and annual  rate  of  growth  is  highly  inconsistent  and  has  fluctuated  during  the  period  of  study.  Pattern  of  output  indicate  that academic institutions were the primary contributors.  Among  the  scientific  agencies  CSIR  and  DRDO  topped  the list. Among the prolific research institutions Mysore  University topped the list closely followed by University  of Delhi.  However, CSIR-NISTADS and CSIR-NISCAIR  received highest number of citations. Among the journals  used  for  publication  of  research  results,  SRELS  Journal  of  Information  Measurement  was  found  to  be  the  most  popular  amongst  Indian  LIS  researchers.  Analysis  of  sub-disciplines  of  research  topics  found  Bibliometrics/  Scientometrics as the most popular research area followed  by User Studies. A list of prolific authors identified B.M.  Gupta  as  the  most  prolific  author  and  K.C.  Garg  as  the
