It has designed and implemented  its own digital repository; created and implemented 24X7 cyber library and has established a state the art computer  lab for the people with visual impairment. In short, the library has made available all those facilities and services  to its patrons to enable them take their academic endeavours to new heights. The results obtained from the study  validate the above mentioned claims and at the same time point out some areas that need improvement.

A library plays a very important role in promoting the  progress of knowledge. In academic setup, it is considered  as a 'heart' that pumps and supplies information to various  academic departments to ensure the overall health of the  education  system.  Sir  Dorabji  Tata  Memorial  Library,  Tata  Institute  of  Social  Sciences  (TISS)  is  making  all  possible  efforts  to  live  upto  the  expectations  of  its  user  community  by  introducing,  utilising  and  implementing  all  cutting  edge  technologies  in  the  management  of  library  operations.  Established  in  1936,  the  library  has  achieved many milestones in the last eight decades of its  untiring support to the academic programmes offered at  the institute. Its balanced collection of books, availability  of  a  wide  range  of  journals,  convenient  library  timings,  uninterrupted  in-house  and  online  information  services,  use  of  cutting  edge  technology  to  manage  error  free  library operations have made this library popular among  the  social  scientists  in  the  country1. 
Although the library has maximum to offer in terms  of  collection,  service,  and  facilities,  it  is  not  foolproof  like  any  other  service  entity.  It  has  to  deal  requests  for  books  not  available  in  the  collection;  issues  concerned  to  the  working  of  electronic  gadgets  installed  in  the  library  and  sometimes  with  its  unhappy  library  users.  Considering  these  points  was  undertaken  a  study  using  a survey method to understand the perception of its user  community (students, staff and faculty) about the library  and  its  services.  The  study  has  brought  forth  important  points  which  are  presented  in  the  present  paper.

An attempt is made to review some of the important  studies  conducted  in  the  similar  areas  of  the  present  
research.  These  reviews  have  helped  the  researchers  to  indentify the gap in the research and eventually formulate  their  own  research  questions  and  design  their  study  to  fill  that  gap. 
A study about users' satisfaction with library information  resources  and  services  was  conducted  at  the  College  of  Health  Sciences  (CHS)  library  Niger  Delta  University,  Nigeria.  The  purpose  of  the  study  was  to  examine  the  service satisfaction of library users. The study adopted a  survey method, using a population of 687 registered users  in the College of Health Sciences Library. The sample size  of 180 was selected through random sampling technique.  The  finding  revealed  that  the  users  were  satisfied  with  the  book  lending  services  of  library,  renewal  of  library  materials,  and  longer  hours  of  internet  services  in  the  library,  but  the  users  were  not  happy  with  the  number  of  reference  materials  and  academic  journals  in  various  areas2. 
      
Academic libraries that serve the users from virtual  platforms should keep a tab on the changing preferences  and  search  behaviours  of  their  users  to  adjust  and  offer  the  library  services  accordingly.  A  study  conducted  at  University of West Florida with an intention to understand  the user satisfaction revealed that most of the users were  satisfied  with  the  online  services  offered  by  the  library.  The  responses  for  the  open-ended  questions  used  in  the  survey questionnaire generated a number of suggestions.  Of  them,  the  need  for  the  improvement  in  navigation  was  highlighted  by  most  of  the  users3. 
A  study  conducted  at  California  State  University,  USA to understand the users' perception about the library  and its services revealed that the students were unaware  of  the  importance  of  librarians  and  the  possible  help  that  they  would  seek  from  the  librarians  in  their  study.

Some of the respondents were even unaware of the term  'librarian'.  The  users  were  not  in  a  position  to  make  distinction  between  the  librarians  and  paraprofessional  staff.  It  was  felt  that  the  academic  libraries  are  not  doing  their  job  properly.  The  study  suggested  that  the  users  need  to  be  oriented  about  the  library  resources  and  services  and  the  they  be  provided  with  hand  on  experience  in  searching  and  utilising  the  information  resources  in  the  library4. 
A  study  conducted  in  Africa  to  understand  the  needs  of  students  with  regard  to  study  the  spaces  and  environment  revealed  that  there  was  mismatch  between  the  students  needs  and  the  library  services  available  in  Africa. The study found that despite a great disatisfaction  with  library  services,  a  majority  of  the  respondents  preferred  to  study  in  the  library.  The  authors  felt  that  the  lack  of  conducive  study  environment  in  the  homes  of the respondents could be one of the reasons for their  preference  to  library.  The  authors  suggested  that  the  implementation  of  many  virtual  characteristics  of  the  library  must  be  based  on  the  local  requirements5. 
The academic libraries, if they open for community  members,  could  make  a  lot  difference  in  the  society. A  study  conducted  to  understand  the  current  practices  of  the urban and metropolitan universities found that these  universities  provide  library  services  to  the  unaffiliated  members at free of cost or at nominal fee basis without  any financial burden on the part of their parent institutions.  Library  Deans  and  Directors  perceive  these  services  as  an  opportunity  to  serve  the  community  members6. 
3. objecTIveS 
User studies and surveys occupy a prominent place  in  the  process  of  enhancing  and  improving  the  user  satisfaction  and  increase  the  usage  of  library  resources  and facilities7. It is through such studies that the libraries  can plan for the introduction of any new services, assess  the  existing  services  decide  whether  to  continue  or  discontinue  them.  Thus,  present  study  understands  the  needs  and  requirements  of  the  users  of  SDTM  Library,  TISS.  The  study  was  carried  out  with  the  following  research  objectives. 
(a) To  understand  the  effectiveness  of  the  services  
offered  by  SDTM  Library, TISS. 
(b) To  identify  the  problems  faced  by  the  users  in  
availing  the  library  services  and  facilities. 
The  findings  of  the  study  will  help  and  guide  the  managers  and  the  administrators  of  the  library  to  take  informed  decisions  on  the  matters  concerned  to  the  library. 
4.  MeThodoLogy 
The study adopted a survey method to investigate the  problem. An online questionnaire designed using 'Google  Forms'  was  utilsed  for  the  study8.  The  questionnaires  were mailed to to around 200 participants comprising the  
412 
students,  staff,  and  faculty  members  at  TISS,  Mumbai  Campus. A deadline was set to submit the questionnaires  online.  As  a  result,  112  responses  were  collected.  The  collected  data  was  analysed  with  the  help  of  MS-Excel  and  presented  in  a  tabular  form  for  interpretation  and  understanding. 
5. dATA  An ALySIS And dIScUSSIonS 
A  majority  of  the  respondents  98  (88  %)  belong  to  the  student  category,  while  a  small  portion  9  (8  %)  belong to the category of faculty and 5 (4 %) belong to  the  category  of  staff.  It  becomes  very  clear  from  these  findings  that  the  student  community  is  more  responsive  for academic surveys compared to these staff and faculty  members. 
A majority of the respondents 51 (46 %) respondents  belong  to  the  age  group  of  between  20-25,  while  26  (23  %  )  of  the  respondents  belong  to  the  age  group  of  26-30,  18  (16  %)  of  the  respondents  belong  to  31- 35  and  small  chunk  of  respondents  16  (14  %)  belong  to  the  age  group  of  36  and  above.  A  majority  of  the  respondents who participated in the survey are under the  age  of  30.  It  again  shows  the  spirit  of  younger  people  to  participate  in  academic  surveys.

From  these  findings,  it  becomes  clear  that  library is considered as one of the most favourite places  among the TISS community. A very small portion (15 %)   respondents said that they visit the library occasionally.  This  may  be  due  to  the  facilities  such  as  remote  access  to  e-resources,  provided  by  the  library.

A  very  small  portion  of  the respondents (15 %) rated this as 'Poor'. 26 % of the  respondents  skipped  this  question.  Table  2  the  reason  could  be  their  unawareness  about  this  service.

A  majority  of  the  respondents  (64  %)  skipped  the  question  about  reprograpy  services.  The  reason  may  be  the  investigator’s  use  of  the  word  ‘reprography’  in  the  questionnaire.

mark. 
(g) 18 % respondents rated the Selective Dissemination  
of Information  (SDI) Service offered by the library  
as  poor  while  29  %  of  the  respondents  preferred  
not  to  comment  on  it.  
(h) 31 % users have expressed their unhappiness about the  
Baggage  Counter  at  the  library's  entrance  gate. (i) 63  %  respondents  rated  the  Disability  Information  
Services  offered  by  the  library  as  good  service. (j) 95 % respondents found the 'Institutional Repository'  
established  by  the  library  as  useful. 
(k) 56 % respondents regularly use the 'Remote Access  
to  E-Resources'  facility  initiated  by  the  library. (l) 80  %  respondents  are  happy  with  the  services  and  
assistance of library staff. They have expressed this  
opinion  by  rating  the  service  as  good.  
(m) 61  %  respondents  termed  the  SDTM  Library,  TISS  
as  'Excellent  both  in  Collection  and  Services’. 
The  findings  of  the  study  reflect  and  reconfirm  the  fact  that  SDTM  Library,  TISS  is  one  of  the  few  social  science libraries in the country that are rich in collection  and  best  in  services. As  Leonard  Cohen  says,  “there  is  crack  in  everything,  that's  how  the  light  gets  in”,  there  are  few  areas  in  the  library  on  which  it  needs  to  work  further for improvement. Following are some suggestions  based  on  the  findings  of  the  present  study. 
Library is ‘excellent both in collection and service’, 21 %  
said  that  the  library  ‘excellent  in  collection  but  poor  in  
(a)  In the last few years, the number of students studying  
service’  while  13  %  of  the  respondents  said  the  library  
‘poor  in  collection  but  excellent  in  service’  and  a  very  
small  portion  of  the  respondents  (3  %)  said  that  ‘poor  both  in  collection  and  service’.  From  these  finding  it  
becomes evident that the library is rich both in collection  
and  service  and  the  users  are  happy  with  it.

(a) 52  %  commonly  that  they  use  the  library  services  
daily. 
(b) 97 % respondents (42 % good, 35 % very good, 20  
in  the  campus  has  been  increased  3  folds.  As  a  results,  the  facility  created  for  students'  baggage  a  long  ego  has  become  insufficient  to  accommodate  all  bags.  Hence,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  plan  for  new  Baggage  Counter  with  the  capacity  of  accommodating  at  least  350-400  bags. 
(b)  There  is  a  need  to  review  the  process  of  providing  
both  the  CAS  and  SDI  services  as  a  considerable  
chunk  of  the  respondents  either  expressed  their  
unhappiness  or  preferred  not  to  comment  on  the  
quality  of  these  services.
