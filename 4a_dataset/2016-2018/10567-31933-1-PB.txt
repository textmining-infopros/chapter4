ABSTRACT 
The effectiveness of electronic resources and services in select campuses of Fiji National University Library on  the basis of users’ satisfaction is evaluated. A survey method was employed to conduct this research. Out of sixteen  campus libraries of FNU, the researcher selects eight libraries from different division of Fiji in the user’s survey.  150 well-structured questionnaires were distributed to gather information related to uses of electronic resources and  services. The 140 flled questionnaireswere collected from students and faculty members and analysed, classifed  and tabulated by employing simple statistical methods. The study reveals that majority of the users of FNU libraries  keep themselves abreast of developments in electronic resources, services and their proper utilisation in the feld of  academic and research. The result showed a growing interest in e-resources among the users and also found that  slow downloading and blockage of website is the hurdle in proper utilisation of electronic resources. The survey  further reveals that the majority of respondents are aware of the usage of e-resources and services.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Electronic resources and services, offered by libraries,  have dramatically changed scientist’s and academician usage  patterns  in  Fiji  during  recent  years.  Technologies  have  played vital role in education in terms of communication  played  both  academic  knowledge  and  local  wisdom  to  academic society. In the current scenario, the e-resources  and services are considered an important part of information  sources  to  provide  efficient  services  to  the  information  seekers. Maidabino1 attempt  to  determine  that  academic  library  plays  an  essential  role  in  the  transmission  of  information  and  knowledge  in  higher  education.  They  are  anticipated  to  acquire,  preserve,  store,  manipulate  and disseminate information resources that would fulfill  the  needs  of  both  contemporary  and  academic  society  and  future  users  too.  According  to  Majid  &  Abazova2 “The  library  plays  an  important  role  for  the  academic  development  and  provide  instructional  services  such  as  information  literacy,  orientation  and  training  for  use  of  library  resources.”  If  efficient  and  effective  use  is  to  be  made  of  library’s  e-resources,  then  user  orientation  will have to be increased in both intensity and coverage.  It  is  important  to  remember  that  the  ability  of  library  professionals  to  keep  up  to  date  is  necessary,  and,  therefore, training for them is crucial as well. According  to  Skaggs;  Poe  &  Stevens3   “Electronic  resource  is  a  simple  and  common  term  that  can  encompass  anything  from  a  PDF  of  a  government  report  to  an  aggregated  database”.

system  or  tool  with  an  aim  of  support  there  users  in  accessing,  interpreting,  disseminating  and/or  using  electronic information can be considered as an electronic  information resource’ According to Dadzie5 in the current  era,  library  services,  e-resources  are  considered  as  an  essential  component  of  information  sources  to  provide  efficient  services  to  the  information  seekers.  Electronic  information  sources  are  significant  research  tools  that  complement  the  print  information  sources  in  traditional  library  services.  
E-resources  are  becoming  very  important  these  days  as  they  are  more  up-to-date,  and  can  be  accessed  anywhere,  across  the  world.  Such  resources  add  value  while  conducting  R&D  activities.  Thus  this  topic  was  selected to study the various e-resources and analyse the  utility  and  effectiveness  in  provision  of  the  information  services  provided  by  campus  libraries. 
1.1. Historical  Study  of  Fiji  National  University  
Fiji, is a country situated in South Pacific region, is  an  archipelago  of  more  than  300  islands.  Fiji  is  one  of  the most developed economies in the Pacific region due  to  an  abundance  of  mineral,  forest,  and  fish  resources.  Fiji’s literacy rate is about 93.7%. Fijian Education is a  combination of multi-racialism and multiculturalism allows  for  the  guidance  and  administration.  The  Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission  in  Fiji  is  taking  major  steps  to  promote and subsidise the educational fees and other costs  related to it and hence bringing it under the affordability

of every citizen. Technical education is mostly under the  University of the South Pacific, Fiji National University  and University of Fiji. Now, the Fiji National University  has 16 campuses and 33 centers located in the country. The Fiji National University is an establishment to serve  the needs of Post-secondary education in Fiji and all the  associated  libraries  provide  a  welcoming,  comfortable,  and safe environment that supports teaching, learning and  research.  The  Fiji  National  University  libraries  consists  of  a  main  Library  located  in  Nasinu  Campus  and  other  libraries in fifteen places across the country. As an integral  part  of  the  academic  programmes  of  the  university  and  support  service  for  the  entire  university,  the  libraries  provide  and  maintain  a  fluid  collection  of  monographs,  state of the art communications for information resources;  manuscripts, electronic documents and periodicals acquired  by the library. The library provides access to on-site and  remote access electronic full-text resources. Further, the  FNU  Libraries  pursue  goals  of  excellence  in  different  activities through services, collections, and inter-library  cooperation  which  ensures  access  to  information  and  knowledge.  It  strives  to  provide  excellent  assistance  in  finding  and  evaluating  resources  to  students,  staff  and  alumina  on-site  in  different  campuses  and  centers  at  a  distance. 
2.  LITERATURE  REVIEW 
E-resources  and  services  are  the  backbone  of  the  modern  library,  and  user’s  satisfaction  is  one  of  the  methods  to  evaluate  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  library services. Therefore, it is essential and beneficiary  to assess the library resources and services extracted and  user  satisfaction  because  successfulness  of  any  library  depends  upon  how  well  a  service  fulfills  the  demands  placed upon by the library users. Hence, standard services  are ultimate goals of libraries as service organisations. A  number of studies on the use of e-resources and services  have been carried out by students, teachers and scientists  of  various  institutions  all  over  the  world. 
Erens6  opined ‘How recent developments in university  libraries affect research’ and explore that, current academies  were  making  good  use  of  e-resources  and  services  in  university  library.  University  library  services  had  expressively  improved  during  the  last  decade  and  most  of the academic staffs were satisfied with e-resources and  services. Khan & Bhatt7  conducted a study and explored  the  attitudes  of  students  of  the  Islamic  University  of  Bahawalpur, Pakistan towards learning through the internet.  The  results  of  research  showed  that  the  respondents  were  not  satisfied  with  the  internet  service  provided  by  university,  slow  connectivity  of  internet  and  inadequate  number  of  computers  in  computer  lab.  Nwalo8   aim  to  investigate  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  a  good  library  is  usually  measured  by  how  well  the  library  fulfills the users’ needs and requirements relative to the  library’s goals and objectives. According to Ababio9, et al.,  libraries  must  to  be  assessed  and  evaluated  while  a

period  time  by  their  users. A  number  of  studies,  Eager  & Oppenheim10   stated  that  a  user-based  assessment  can  provide  precious  information  to  libraries  in  re-orienting  their  collections,  services  and  activities  for  effectively  meeting their information needs. Nadiri & Mayboudi11 depict  that the higher education institutions are keenly involved  in knowing the perceptions of academic community and  quality of services to attract students, fulfill their needs  and  retaining  them.  They  stated  that  the  key  to  sustain  in today’s intensive competition lies in delivering quality  service that will, in turn, result in customer satisfactions.  Kassim,12   studied  however,  try  to  understand  the  causes  of  user  dissatisfaction  to  improve  service  performance  delivered  by  the  academic  libraries  and  satisfying  user  needs has been the primary objective of academic libraries.  Every year the new students come to the institution with  different  needs  and  expectations.  White  &  Abels13   and  Hernon & Altman14  over two decades years ago, noted that  university  libraries  are  facing  the  challenges  on  several  directions, such as electronic information providers, rise of  book stores, document delivery services, remote learning,  multimedia  products,  and  other  competitive  sources  of  information that seem to be threatening their role. These  new tools and technique have brought substantial changes  in the way academic libraries operate today, and also in  terms  of  user  needs  and  expectations.  Hence,  there  is  a  need  for  university  libraries  to  continually  monitor  the  user  needs  and  service  qualities  so  as  to  improve  and  strengthen  their  services.  Tyagi15   reported  that  almost  all  Indian  Pharmacopoeia  Commission  Scientists  and  Associates  were  seen  to  use  new  versions  of  e-journals  (100%),  online  database  (100%),  CD-ROM  database  (100%),  subject  specific  information  websites  (89%)  &  e-books  (79%)  and  other  internet  based  resources.  The  author  also  revealed  that  some  Scientists  (30.77%)  and  Associates  (37.50%)  prefer  print  version  of  journals.  Majority  of  them  prefer  to  take  along  printouts  instead  of  downloading  on  storage  devices.  Sohail  and   Alvi,16 concluded a study of JN Medical College at AMU Aligarh  and  found  that  100%  of  the  students  were  aware  and  used  for  retrieving  quick  information  of  e-resources  as  reliable resources generally in cyber cafe as well as with  personal  connection  and  satisfied  with  the  web  services  provided  by  the  college. 
3.  SCOPE AND  LIMITATIONS  OF THE  STUDY 
Scholarly  resources  continue  to  be  converted  from  print  to  electronic  format.  Nearly  all  of  FNU  library’s  electronic  database  subscriptions  are  now  available  online.  The  library  currently  comprises  of  more  than  64,340 e-journal titles. Despite the financial and technical  limitations of converting the print to e-book, the library  now provides access to almost 180,767 e-books. In general,  use  of  the  library’s  major  packages  of  e-resources  has  increased in the last three years. The study geographical  area  is  restricted  to  students  and  faculty  members  of  the  selected  campuses  of  Fiji  National  University,  Fiji  only. E-resources and services in university libraries are

making  a  significant  role  of  library  activities.  A  huge  amount is invested in the development of e-resources in  the  libraries.  But  without  conducting  a  study,  there  is  no  way  of  knowing  whether  the  users  accept  them  or  not,  do  they  find  the  e-resources  and  services  easy  to  use,  reliable,  and  useful  or  are  e-resources  effectively  in  use.  The  study  offers  to  identify  the  acceptance  of  e-resources and services in the library under study along  with its advantages, performances, user’s satisfaction and  barriers faced during the use of e-resources and services.  The study is designed to seek user’s opinion concerning  the use of e-resources and services in different campuses  of  FNU  libraries. 
4.  OBJECTIVES  
of  FNU.  Respondents  were  randomly  selected  sitting  at  the campus library from different departments. The total  population of library users was very large and it was not  practical  to  survey  the  entire  population  and  to  conduct  in-depth research. Therefore reasonable, manageable and  convenient  samples  are  randomly  selected  from  the  top  eight  largest  libraries  where  the  students’  enrollment  was high. Out of the 150 distributed questionnaires, 140  were  completed  and  returned  an  overall  response  rate  is  93%.  Out  of  140  complete  questioners,  90(78.84%)  respondents  were  students  and  50(17.30%)  respondents  were  faculty  members.

5.  METHODOLOGY 
The FNU Library is ISO 9001:2008 certified and is the  only library in the South Pacific holding ISO certification  which  therefore  plays  a  vital  role  in  carrying  out  the  survey. The University has a total of 16 libraries located  in FNU Campuses and Centers throughout Fiji. The survey  was carried out in September 2016 with a vision to obtain  valuable feedback from the library users and to provide  high quality and responsive one-stop service. The paper  describes these surveys, including the end results and the  improvements  to  be  adopted.  Responses  gathered  from  user  surveys  provide  literally  important  information  for  improving the library services. The population of the study  consists of the library users associated in selected campus  library of the Fiji National University. The primary data  were  gathered  using  self-administered  with  open-ended  questionnaires were personally distributed to the students  and  faculty  members  in  the  different  campus  libraries  
16(11.4%)  while  the  least  respondent  from  Maritime  were  12(8.5%).

6.2.  Frequency  of  Use  of  E-resources 
This  is  the  most  important  and  basic  aspect  related  to  the  assessment  and  usefulness  of  e-resources.  Here  an  attempt  has  been  made  to  find  out  the  frequency  use  of  e-resources.  It  can  be  found  from  Table  2,  that  11(22%)  faculty  members  visited  daily,  while  9(18%)  visited  two  to  three  times  a  week  and  7(14%)  faculty  members  use  these  resources  weekly,  13(26%)  of  the  faculty members visited the library monthly, and 10(20%)  visited  occasionally.  On  the  other  hand  29(32.22%) students, were visiting the library daily while 12(13.33%)  visited  2-3  times  in  a  week,  and  20(22.22%)  students  visited weekly. 13(14.44%) of the students are found to  be visiting monthly, while 16(17.77%) of the respondents  reported  that  they  visited  occasionally.  Thus,  the  data  show  that,  highest  40(28.57%)  library  users  visited  the  library  at  daily  and  out  of  all  the  lowest  21(15%)  users  of  library  visited  two  to  three  times  a  week.

6.3. Descriptive  Statistics  of  Users’ Awareness  of  
E-resources 
Table 3 reveals the awareness of e-resources among  the faculty members and students. The analysis shows that  47(94%)  faculty  members  were  aware  of  the  e-library,  while  all  faculty  members  were  aware  of  the  Moodle,  online  research  tool,  e-database  and  OPAC  followed  by  48(96%)  faculty  member  were  found  that  they  aware  about e-book and 42(84%) faculty members were aware  of e–dictionary 38(76%) faculty members were aware of  E-quick  Reference.  On  other  hand,  the  Table  3  reveals  the awareness of e-library 82(91.1%) Students were aware  of  e-books.  90(100%)  overall  students  were  aware  of  Moodle and OPAC. 86(95.5%) students were made aware  of  Online  Research  Tool  and  70(77.7%)  students  were  aware  of  E-book,  while  74(82.2%)  students  were  aware  about  E-database,  68(75.5%)  were  aware  by  E-quick  Reference. The analysis shows that all respondents were  aware of the online public access catalogue shortly most  awareness of this, while 106 (75.7%) is lowest awareness  about  E-Quick  Reference.  
6.4. Electronic  Services  in  Library:  User  
Satisfaction  Statistics 
The  statistical  procedure  was  employed  to  examine  satisfaction about electronic services in library. The result  indicates  that  there  is  significant  difference  among  the  opinion  of  the  library  users  in  this  sample  regarding

6.5.  Purpose  of  Using  E-resources 
Table 5 indicate that the purpose of using e-resources  shows  that  92%  faculty  members  and  82.22%  students  use  e-resources  for  research  purpose.  Where  as  494%  faculty  members  and  92.22%  students  stated  that  they  used  e-resources  for  finding  significant  information  in  the  area  of  specialisation,  52%  faculty  members  and  97.77% students used it for keeping up-to-date in subject  information. 60% faculty members and 86.66% students  use it for getting current information, while 66% faculty  members  used  e-resources  for  teaching  purpose  and  91.11%  students    were  using  them  in  order  to  prepare  their assignments. It is interesting to observe that 92.85%  respondents  use  the  library’s  e-resources  for  finding  significant  information  in  the  area  of  specialisation. 
6.6.  Search  Options  Used 
Table  6  describes  that  92%  faculty  members  and  81.11% students were using Boolean logic for searching  e-resources,  whereas  96%  faculty  members  and  97.77%  students were using weighted term searching, 86% faculty  members  and  91.11%  students  were  using  subject  term  (Truncated) searches and 88% faculty members, 93.33%  students preferred using full-text search. The conclusion  from the analysis may be drawn that majority of respondents  are aware of the search options for accessing e-resources.  The highest preferred 136(97.14%) respondents are using  weighted  term  search  technique.

the  globe  have  brought  in  a  revolution  in  electronic  publication, access, subscription, and delivery mechanism.  Presently e-resources have become the largest and fastest  growing  areas  of  digital  collections  for  most  of  our  libraries and it has many benefits. Some of the important  benefits  of  e-resources  extracted  from  the  views  of  the  respondents  are  as  shown  in  Table  7.  
It  is  inferred  that  43(86%)  of  the  faculty  members  and  86(95.55%)  students  feel,  e-resources  are  time  saving, 38(76%) faculty members and 81(90%) students  said  that  e-resources  are  easy  to  use,  44(88%)  of  the  faculty  members  and  72(80%)  students  admitted  that  these  are  more  informative,  40(80%)  faculty  members  and  70(77.77%)  students  stated  that  these  are  more  useful,  and  38(76%)  faculty  members  and  76(84.44%)  students advocate that the e-resources are more preferred  compare  to  printed  resources.  It  is  inferred  that  highest  129(92.14%)  respondents  feel  that  in  comparison  to  conventional  documents,  e-resources  are  time  saving.

7.  DISCUSSION 
The  study  has  shown  that  e-resources  and  services  provided  by  FNU  libraries  perform  an  increasingly  important  role  in  research  at  Fiji  National  University.  Not  only  current  e-resources  are  required,  but  faculty  members and students need to be provided with the use  of  significant  electronic  back  runs  as  well.  With  the  changing paradigm of educational horizon, an electronic  resource  has  gained  global  currency.  Better  and  more  effective  management  of  information  would  be  more  feasible through the availability of the latest equipment and  modern infrastructure and services in library. The benefits  of e-resources can only be reaped when a supporting and  enabling  environment  is  created  for  users.  
8.  CONCLUSIONS 
E-resources  and  services  seem  to  be  considered  very  important  in  the  present  era.  The  e-resources  and  services  of  libraries  are  playing  very  significant  role  for  the  functioning  of  any  academic  organisation  as  well as nation buildings. These e-resources and services  need to be harnessed and utilised properly. The survival  of  an  academic  organisation  largely  depends  upon  the  utility  of  its  e-resources  and  services  in  relation  to  the  community  it  serves.  Services  of  libraries  based  on  management  principles  need  to  be  renewed  frequently  
170 
keeping in view the changing requirements of the users.  The  ample  amount  of  modern  resources,  innovative  library  services,  need  for  adequate  information  literacy  and  aptness  in  using  the  existing  sources  has  become  the  need  of  the  hour. 
Findings  of  this  study  confirm  that,  most  of  the  objectives  have  been  accomplished  in  this  study  of  a  relatively small sample and knowledge of its researchers  and several major conclusions can be drawn. This study  also reveals its impact in terms of awareness and effective  use of the available resources with a few constraints by  the library users. It is found from the analysis that faculty  members and students responding to the survey of campus  libraries  reveals  a  good  deal  of  interest  in  frequent  use  of  e-resources  and  services.The  survey  analysis  also  depict  that  a  majority  of  the  respondents  are  aware  of  the  search  options  for  accessing  e-resources.  The  study  has  identified  the  problems  faced  by  the  users  in  the  use  of  e-resources  and  services,  including,  inadequate  IT infrastructure, and blockade of websites. In addition,  library users indicated a lack of skills required in using  these  services,  and  noted  a  discouraging  attitude  of  library staff in helping them with the use of e-resources  and  services.  Further  research  with  a  broader  scope,  or  using  cluster  and/or  stratified  sampling,  would  provide  additional  information  about  this  important  topic.
