This study fnds out usage pattern of social networking sites (SNS) of academicians in scholarly communication  in the Central Himalayan region of Uttarakhand state universities of India. The results revealed that 93 % faculty  members of State universities of Uttarakhand were using SNS and sharing of information was the highest amongst  them. 44 % were using SNS several times a day, 48 % faculty members thought that SNS information were reliable.  33 % faculty members believed that there was a possibility of fraud through SNS and 41.64 % faculty members  believed that SNS had a little impact on their lives. 28.75% were using Facebook, which was highest in all SNS.  The result indicated that the percentage usage by the faculty members in terms of the latest knowledge was 38.0%.  Mostly faculty members were using the SNS from their homes. One very important factor responsible for this  could be the lack of Wi-Fi facility available to them in all the campuses of the universities. Therefore the study  recommends that Wi-Fi should be made available in all the universities, so that the faculties can use them in their  academic pursuit, during their working hour in the campus, and this will further lead to an in depth use of SNS  
for academic excellence.

Human  beings  live  in  a  community  and  are  a  part  of social and private institutions which create a sense of  belonging and group membership among the individuals.  These institutions of community are an integral component  of  a  society.  The  society  plays  a  significant  role  in  transforming  an  individual’s  personality  and  behavior  since  birth.  The  society  has  always  been  the  key  factor  through which an individual learns to communicate. This  unique  invention  has  changed  the  world  into  a  global  village.  It  revolutionised  the  communication  level  and  lifestyle  of  the  people  all  over  the  world  because  of  its  extensive  applications.  It  not  only  empowered  an  individual  to  instantly  access  the  information  from  any  corner  of  the  world  but  also  changed  the  working  style  by  minimising  the  effort  and  time  to  complete  a  task.  
The social networking is way of 21st century communication  now. The popularity of social networking sites (SNS) is  increasing  amongst  academicians,  researchers,  students  and  other  civil  society  peoples.  There  are  numerous  advantages  of  using  SNS  especially  in  academic World.  Earlier  studies  suggested  that  SNS  can  be  applied  in  online open courses having different discipline in different  module.  In  graduate  and  post  graduate  level  it  could  enhance  students’  communication  globally.  India  is  the  third  largest  higher  education  system  in  the  world.  In  several  institutions,  the  faculty  members  utilise  SNS  to  contact their students regarding any project or assignment.  This helps in enhancing their teaching-learning capabilities  with  minimal  effort.

presently, SNS play a vital role in rapid dissemination  of useful information to its users. SNS are accessible to  the  masses  and  used  in  virtual  meetings,  work  places,  where concerned members present and view information.  These sites have developed as a medium of self-expression  that  not  only  allows  them  to  interact  but  also  share  their expertise in their field of specialisation to promote  commerce  and  change  the  society.  These  are  important  not  only  to  socially  interact  but  economically  too  and  also  beneficial  for  educational  purposes.  Other  than  traditional  and  restricted  learning,  online  groups  are  in  vogue  among  individuals  who  are  self-managed,  well- oriented,  focused  and  active  in  creation  of  new  ideas  easily  accessible  to  others.  social  networking  sites  like  WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google plus, MySpace,  Research Gate, etc. are being used by faculty members,  scientists, scholars and students for online education and  information sharing outside the formal traditional systems.  Hence the study focuses on the use of SNS in scholarly  communication  amongst  teaching  fraternity.  
The  SNS  plays  a  predominant  role  in  information  sharing  among  individuals.  Even  though  it  operates  on  internet  platform,  it  is  reliable  site  with  the  privacy  of  its users as it blocks encroachment on the literatures by  unregistered users. The faculty members of the universities  related to this study makes the best possible use of SNS  for  academic  purposes  by  exchanging  information.  It  develops online networks, scholarly communities, locating  online research resources, tracking references with social  media  tools.  This  study  is  confined  to  the  use  of  SNS  for  information  communication  by  faculty  members  in  state universities of Uttarakhand, who are concerned with  teaching  and  research  work.  The  following  universities  were  selected  for  the  study:  
• Kumaun  University  (KU),  Nainital 
• G.B. pant University of Agriculture and Technology  
(GBpU), pant  Nagar 
• Uttarakhand Technical  University(UTU),  Dehradun • Doon  University  (DU),  Dehradun

3.1  Hypotheses 
On the basis of the literature review and objectives of the  proposed  study  following  hypotheses  were  formulated: H1 The SNS are mostly used by faculty members of the  
state  universities  in  Uttarakhand.  
H2  Facebook is the most widely used SNS for information  
communication  by  faculty  members. 
H3    The  SNS  were  used  by  faculty  members  primarily  
for  the  purpose  of  getting  updated  information  and  
connecting  with  other  professionals.  
H4    The  SNS  are  helpful  for  educational  advancement  
but  some  of  the  information  available  on  SNS  is  
not  reliable.

6.1 objectives-related findings 
(a)  To  find  out  the  use  of  social  networking  sites  by  
the  faculty  members  
About 93 % were using SNS and 7 % of the faculty  members  were  not  using  SNS. 
(b) To  explore  the  purpose  of  using  SNS 
Sharing  of  information  was  the  highest  in  the  state  universities  of  Uttarakhand.  Its  percentage  was  27.8  %,  communication  of  research  output  was  18  %.  However,  the  use  of  SNS  in  creating  awareness  was  15  %. While  making  friends  and  entertainment  has  the  same  sharing  percentage of 14 % each and the use of SNS in published  research  work  faster  was  11  %.  The  SNS  were  used  by  the  faculty  members  to  derive  the  maximum  exposure  towards  the  latest  knowledge.  The  SNS  helps  to  gain  more  visibility  in  any  area  of  research.  It  also  helps  in  the decimation of information among the various groups.  It  promotes  to  publish  research  work  faster. 
(c)  To  find  out  the  frequency  and  duration  of  using  
SNS 
The  result  revealed  overall  percentage  wise  pattern  of frequency of SNS. The percentage usage of the faculty  members  in  terms  of  several  times  a  day  was  44  %.  Similarly,  30  %  faculty  members  used  SNS  once  in  a  day.  14  %  faculty  members  used  it  occasionally.  7  %  respondents used it once in a few days and 5 % faculty  members  used  it  once  in  a  week. 
(d) To  find  out  the  information  reliability  of  SNS 
About48  %  faculty  members  thought  that  SNS  information  was  reliable.  42  %  faculty  members  were  not  sure  about  the  reliability  pertaining  to  information  and  only  10  %  faculty  members  were  not  relied  in  the  information  of  SNS. 
(e)  To  know  the  problems  being  faced  by  the  faculty  
members  while  using  SNS. 
The  result  exhibited  overall  percentage  patterns  of  disadvantages  or  problems  facing  by  faculty  members  with  SNS.  33  %  faculty  members  believed  that  there  was  a  possibility  of  fraud  through  SNS.  25  %  faculty  members said that using SNS were waste of time. 17 %  faculty members thought that SNS gives lack of privacy.  15  %  faculty  members  believed  that  SNS  were  very  distracting  and  10  %  faculty  members  said  that  SNS  were  gives  mental  stress. 
(f)  To  find  out  the  impact  of  SNS  on  faculty  members  
life  in  state  universities  of  Uttarakhand 
The  last  objective  explored  that  overall  percentage  pattern  of  impact  of  SNS  on  faculty  members’  life.  
41.64 % faculty members believed that SNS had a little  impact on their lives. 34.7 % faculty members said that  they  had  a  vast  impact  of  SNS  on  their  lives.  However,  14.51  %  faculty  members  said  that  they  had  no  impact  of  SNS  on  their  lives  and  9.15  %  faculty  members  had  not  given  any  answers  to  this  question. 
6.2  Hypothesis-related findings  
H1:  SNS  are  mostly  used  by  faculty  members  of  state  
universities  in  Uttarakhand 
Table  1  indicate  the  hypothesis  result  about  overall  that  SNS  are  mostly  used  by  faculty  members  of  state  University, Uttarakhand with applying cross table formula  of  Chi-square.  The  result  shows  that  93  %  were  using  SNS.  However,  7  %  of  the  faculty  members  were  not  using  SNS,  so  the  results  of  hypothesis  testing  indicate  that  there  is  no  significant  difference  among  faculty  members  with  regards  to  the  use  of  SNS. 
H2:  Facebook  is  the  most  used  SNS  for  information  
communication  by  faculty  members 
Table 2 which indicates that Facebook is the most used  social  Networking  Sites  for  information  communication  by  faculty  members  with  applying  formula  of  Chi- square. The result reveals that the maximum percentage  usage  was  28.75  %  that  of  the  Facebook  amongst  all  the universities, the result of hypothesis testing indicate  that  there  is  significant  difference  in  the  usage  pattern  of  SNS  by  the  respondents.  The  result  tells  us  that  the  usage pattern of SNS does differ significantly among the  college. The  alternate  hypothesis  was  accepted. 
H3:  Social  Networking  Sites  used  by  faculty  members  
mainly with the purpose to getting updated information  
and  connecting  with  other  professional  members 
Table  3  indicates  that  SNS  used  mainly  for  the  purpose  to  getting  update  information  and  connecting  with  other  professional  member  with  applying  formula  of  Chi-square.  The  result  displayed  that  use  of  SNS  in  terms  of  sharing  of  information  was  the  highest  in  the  State  Universities  of  Uttarakhand.  Its  percentage  was  28  %.  The  use  of  SNS  in  terms  of  communication  of  research  output  was  18  %.  However,  the  use  of  SNS  in  creating  awareness  was  15  %.  While  the  use  of  SNS  making  friends  and  entertainment  has  the  same  sharing  percentage of 14 % each and the use of SNS in published  research work faster was 11 %. The result of hypothesis  testing  indicates  that  there  is  significant  difference  in  the purpose for which SNS are used by faculty members  of  the  different  universities.  The  alternate  hypothesis  was  accepted. 
H4: SNS are helpful for educational advancement but some  
information  available  on  SNS  is  not  reliable. 
Table 4 indicates that SNS are helpful for educational  advancement  with  applying  formula  of  Chi-square.  The  result indicates that the percentage usage by the faculty  members  in  terms  of  the  latest  knowledge  was  38.0  %.  Similarly the helpfulness of the SNS in the field of research  
299 

========9========

DJLIT, VOL.  36,  NO.  5, SEpTEMBER   2016 
area  was  24.0  %.  Accordingly,  the  SNS  helpfulness  in  dissemination  of  information  was  22.0  %.  Lastly,  the  SNS  helpfulness  to  publish  research  work  faster  was  16.0  %.The  result  of  hypothesis  testing  indicates  that  there  is  a  significant  difference  in  the  helpfulness  of  SNS. Therefore it is inferred that SNS are in fact helpful  for  educational  advancement  to  faculty  members.  The  alternate  hypothesis  was  accepted. 
H4:  Social  networking  sites  are  helpful  for  educational  
advancement  but  some  of  the  information  available  
on  SNS  is  not  reliable. 
Table  5  some  of  the  information  available  on  SNS  is  not  reliable  with  the  help  of  formula  Chi-square  the  result  of  hypothesis  testing  come  out  that  48  %  faculty  members  thought  that  SNS  information  was  reliable.  42 % faculty members were not sure about the reliability  pertaining to information and only 10 % faculty members  were  not  relied  in  the  information  of  SNS. 
7.  CoNCLUSIo NS 
The SNS plays a very significant role in the modern  contest  of  the  ever  changing  world  and  has  become  an  indispensable part of the social structure. It has reduced  the  World  wide  barriers  with  the  free  transfer  of  the  information,  knowledge  and  mutual  exchange  of  use.  The SNS has helped in the mobilisation and the change  of  opinion  of  the  world-wide  community.  The  present  Study  enlightened  the  same  issue,  which  showed  that  mostly  the  faculty  members  of  the  State  University  of  Uttarakhand  were  using  SNS  for  academic  purpose  and  they  were  sharing  their  research  work  through  this  platform  worldwide. 
This  shows  that  SNS  has  the  possibility  to  cross  the  demographic  barriers  and  the  cultural  hindrances.  They  have  the  potential  to  generate  a  uniform  opinion  and  come  to  an  amicable  solution.  Same  changes  have  been  found  in  the  academic  world.  The  result  discloses  that  faculty  members  are  using  SNS  for  their  scholarly  communication  and  in  return  their  circulation  is  ever  increasing. professionals from far and wide are connecting  with  them.  Therefore,  the  study  highlights  the  fact  that  due  to  the  tremendous  use  of  SNS,  it  has  reduced  the  barrier  of  connecting  them  with  the  global  teaching  fraternity or scientist community. This has been possible  because of the free flow of communication between them  through  SNS.  The  study  also  justifies  that  the  sharing  of  information,  ideas  and  mutual  views  has  received  a  huge impetus in their teaching & learning abilities. The  SNS had helped them to expose themselves to the latest  knowledge  and  this  was  the  reason  they  wanted  to  join  a communication or a group for staying up to date with  the  community  news. 
As  the  result  shows  that  Facebook  and  WhatsApp  were  most  used  SNS  by  these  faculty  members,  this  can  be  a  motivating  factor  for  the  librarians  working  in  these academic universities. They can create a Facebook  
300 
page  and  linkit  with  the  library  website  or  create  a  group  in  WhatsApp  for  promoting  their  products  and  services  amongst  them.  They  can  effectively  interact  in  an  online  collaborative  environment  with  their  faculty  members, students and other staff. On the other hand, the  university authority should take it in the right spirit and  make the use of social networking sites, popular and user  friendly. Another  more  interesting  finding  of  this  study  is  that  most  faculty  members  have  been  using  the  SNS  from their homes. One very important factor responsible  for  this  could  be  the  lack  of  Wi-Fi  facility  available  to  them  in  all  the  campuses  of  the  universities.  This  is  very  shocking  findings  in  the  light  of  ever  increasing  dependence  on  technologies  in  all  sphere  of  life. 
Therefore the study recommends that Wi-Fi should be  made available in all the universities, so that the faculties  are  not  handicap  in  their  academic  pursuit,  during  their  working  hour  in  the  campus.  This  will  further  lead  to  an  in  depth  use  of  SNS  for  academic  excellence. 
8.  SUgge StIoNS  for  f UrtHer  reSeArCH 
The  following  points  are  suggested  as  outline  for  further  researches: 
• Further  studies  may  be  designed  on  guidelines  and  
course contents of social networking to educate the  
masses about the use applications of social networking  
sites  to  promote  the  communication  level  between  
faculties  and  students  for  educational  purposes. • A study may be designed, to investigate the quality  
and standard of social networking sites and requirement  
of  people  including  their  views.  
• Comparative studies may be planned to investigate the  
relationship  in  students  with  some  other  variables. • A study may be designed to investigate the awareness  
of illiterate rural and urban people by interview method  
towards  the  use  of  social  networking  sites. • A study may be designed to investigate living style  
of  housewives  and  working  women  with  the  use  of  
social  networking  sites.
