1.  IntroductIon 
Web  2.0  has  ushered  a  new  era  of  social  tools,  social  media,  and  social  networking  facilitating  social  interactions on web platform. The Web 2.0, which made  a  debut  in  2004,  has  been  defined  in  several  different  ways  like  ‘people  to  people  collaboration  in  content  creation  on  the  web’1,  ‘share  information  online,  user  generated  media  content  constantly  modified’2,  ‘open- source, interactive and user-controlled online applications  or  creation  of  informal  users’  networks  facilitating  free  flow of ideas and knowledge’3, and ‘to deliver rich user  experience’4.  Web  2.0,  social  networking  and  social  media are inextricably linked and have in fact often been  used  synonymously5.  Web  2.0  phenomena  have  indeed  made a significant impact on the information landscape.  According to Miller, ‘it is a technology, a philosophy, a  business  plan,  a  behaviour  and  a  participatory  model  to  engage users’, which led Michael Cassey to coin the term  ‘Library  2.0’  and  launch  an  associated  blog  in  20056.  Web  2.0  influenced  the  conceptualisation  of  the  terms  Library  2.0  and  Business  2.0.  Library  2.0  is  the  library

sector’s  response  to  Web  2.0;  Library  2.0  is  a  service  model that relates to the delivery of library programmes  and  services  in  an  innovative  way7.  Web  2.0  supports  or  leads  to  Business  2.0  or  Library  2.0  
  It  also  relates  as  to  how  library  and  information  professionals  are  translating  the  principles  of  Web  2.0  into the design and delivery of library services8,9. Web 2.0  and social media skills will become essential for library  staff as they make transition to becoming Librarian 2.0.  Mishra10   asserts  that  Library  2.0  is  a  mix  of  concepts  that  focus  on  ongoing  conversations  around  the  ways  libraries  should  change  to  make  themselves  and  their  services  viable  to  end  users.  Maness11   defined  ‘Library  2.0  as  the  application  of  interactive  collaborative  and  multimedia web-based technologies to web-based library  services  and  collections’.  Library  2.0  is  certainly  a  paradigm shift in the approach to the delivery of library  services  in  the  internet  age.

on  ‘Web  2.0’,  ‘Web  2.0  and  libraries’  and  ‘Library  2.0’.  These  are  two  studies  on  the  literature  covering  Web  2.0  alone.  Chu  &  Xu12   and  Bharadwaj 
13 
  in  their  publications carried out studies on bibliometric analysis  of  1718    and  3257  documents  respectively  relating  to  Web  2.0  and  its  applications  and  explored  the  various  dimensions  and  characteristics  of  this  fast  emerging  field  of  Web  2.0.  There  are  three  studies  on  literature  covering  only  Web  2.0  and  libraries.  Aharony14,  singh   & Gill15  and  singh16   in  their  studies  used  different  data  sets  on  ‘Web  2.0  and  Libraries’  to  explore  the  growth  and  dimensions  of  the  literature  on  Web  2.0  and  their  application  to  libraries.  
There were five studies in literature covering Library  2.0  alone.  Boxen17,  Padma  &  Ramasamy18,  surulinathi,  Prasannakumari, Duraipandi, Nandhini19  and Gupta, Dhawan   &  Bansal20   in  their  respective  studies  focused  mainly  on  research  trends  in  Library  2.0  and  in  understanding  the  qualitative  or  quantitative  impact  of  Library  2.0  on  libraries.  The  authors  found  that  even  as  Library  2.0  is  indeed  a  subject  of  major  potential  to  libraries,  but  it  is  yet  to  emerge  as  a  popular  subject  for  research  studies in LIs. The present study is designed as a more  comprehensive  bibliometric  study  on  Web  2.0  and  its  library  applications  covering  global  literature  on  the  subject  published  during  the  last  10  years  period  to  explore  current  research  trends  in  the  subject  using  publications  and  citations  indicators.  
3. objectIves 
The  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  measure  and  evaluate  the  research  performance  of  the  world  on  ‘Web  2.0  and  Libraries’  covering  the  period  2006-15,  using  publications  data  sourced  from  scopus  database.  In  particular,  the  study  covers  the  following: (a) Growth of world literature and its distribution by type of  
documents and sources 
(b) Citation pattern of the global research output. 
(c) Contribution, global share, and citation impact of top 10  
most productive countries 
(d) Distribution  of  global  research  output  by  broad  subject  
areas and  identifcation of signifcant keywords (e) Publication  productivity  and  citation  impact  of  most  
productive organisations and authors 
(f) Leading  medium  of  communication  and  to  identify  the  
characteristics of highly cited papers 
4.  MethodoLoGy 
The study retrieved and downloaded publication data  of  the  world  as  well  as  of  top  10  productive  countries  on  ‘Web  2.0  and  Libraries’  from  the  scopus  database  (http://www.scopus.com)  covering  the  period  2006-15.  In  the  search  statement  formed  for  the  purpose,  the  keyword  “Web  2.0”  was  used  in  the  ‘Keyword’  tag  and  ‘Article  title’  tag;  in  another  search  statement  formed,  the  keyword  “Library”  was  used  in  ‘Keyword’  tag,  
262 
‘Article title’ tag, and ‘sRC Title’ tag. These two search  statements were combined to pull out global publications  data  on  ‘Web  2.0  and  libraries’  and  later  restricted  this  search  output  to  time  period  2006-15. This  main  search  statement  as  shown  below  was  further  restricted  to  10  most  productive  countries  one  by  one  in  ‘country  tag’  to  pull  out  country  publications  data.  Furthermore,  the  main  search  statement  was  restricted  to  ‘subject  area’   tag,  ‘country’    tag,  ‘source  title’  tag,    and  ‘affiliation’  tag  in  order  to  pull  out  data  on  publications  stats  by  subject,  collaborating  countries,  organisation-wise  and  journal-wise,  etc.  The  citation  data  was  collected  from  date  of  publication  till  the  end  of  May  2016. The  study  has  used  a  few  quantitative  and  qualitative  indicators  to  measure  and  evaluate  research  performance  in  ‘Web  2.0 and Libraries’ Relative Citation Index, used here, is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  global  share  of  citations  to  the  global  share  of  publications. 
(TITLE(Web  2.0  or  library  2.0)  OR  KEY(Web  2.0  or  library  2.0)  AND  TITLE(librar*)  OR  KEY(librar*)  OR sRCTITLE(librar*)) AND  PUBYEAR  >  2005 AND  PUBYEAR<  2016

  Geographically,  research  studies  on  ‘Web  2.0  and  Libraries’ are highly skewed with the UsA dominating this  field, accounting for the bulk of the global publications  share (37.14 %). Except for the UsA, most other countries  in  the  world  played  only  peripheral  role  in  the  research  studies  on  ‘Web  2.0  and  Libraries’. slow  and  declining  pace  of  research  growth  in  ‘Web  2.0  and  Libraries’,  weak global publications share and global citations share  of  top  15  organisations  and  top  21  authors  are  some  of  the  characteristics  that  clearly  indicate  that  ‘Web  2.0  and  Libraries”  is  still  a  subject  very  much  in  its  initial  stage  of  development.    But  sharp  dip  in  the  pace  of  growth  in  research  output  raises  serious  concerns  about  the  future  of  research  in  this  area.  Given  the  role  that  Web  2.0  tools  have  come  to  play  in  transforming  the  libraries,  and  to  ensure  that  ‘Web  2.0  and  Libraries’  
remains  a  hot  topic  of  research  is  the  coming  times,  it  is  desirable  and  important  on  the  part  of  concerned  countries to take policy initiatives that seek to stimulate  mainstream  research  in  ‘Web  2.0  and  Libraries’  and  encourage  collaborative  research  across  institutions  at  national  and  international  level.
