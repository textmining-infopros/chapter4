1. INTRODUCTION 
Information plays a significant role in our professional  and personal lives. People need information to efficiently   carry  out  work  in  their  respective  fields.  The  advent  of  information and communication technology introduced into  both  news-rooms  and  the  media  culture  in  the  past  few  years  has  changed  the  information  needs  and  habits  of  print and television journalists. Indian model of television  programmes  is  unique  as  it  is  expected  to  pass  on  the  culture from one generation to other and persuasion. The  proliferation of information on the internet, the diffusion  of  communication  technologies  such  as  cell  phones  and  personal digital assistants have increased television media  professionals  capabilities  at  both  seeking  and  gathering  information  for  their  work.  
Media professionals working in media organisations  need  current,  authoritative  and  factual  information  to  construct the news and programms. There is an enormous  need to identify for the qualitative information needs of  media  professionals  because  they  are  the  information  users  as  well  as  information  producers  and  information  communicators.  The  present  study  aims  to  describe  the  television  media  professional’s  information  needs  and  seeking  behaviours  throughout  the  working  day.  
2. MEDIA  LIBRARY

Received 18 December 2016, online published 30 June 2017 
national  and  regional  significance  relating  to  the  audio  visual and media communities and popular culture. This  includes, but is not limited to historical and contemporary  film/video  production,  advertising,  electronic  and  print  journalism,  broadcasting,  photographic  arts,  multimedia  and  music  production.  These  collections  are  contained  in  the  form  of  audio,  video,  photographic,  digital  and  printed  media  formats.  Media  library  also  called  as  archives library, broadcasting library.  Archives encompass  numerous different archives containing different materials  produced or acquired by the television media. Nowdays  due  the  budget  for  managing,  protecting  and  digitising  the archive accounts for only a small part of the media’s  overall  spend. 
Now  all  the  Medias’  are  engaging  in  an  ongoing  project to digitise archived programme material, converting  recordings made on older analogue formats such as audio  tape, videotape and film to electronic formats which are  compatible with modern computer systems. Much of the  audio-visual material was originally recorded on formats  which  are  now  obsolete  and  incompatible  with  modern  broadcast  equipment  due  to  the  fact  that  the  machines  used  to  reproduce  many  formats  are  no  longer  being  manufactured. Additionally, some film and audio formats  are slowly disintegrating, and digitisation also serves as  a digital preservation programme. In this context, Media  library  plays  a  significant  role  in  satisfying  the  huge  information  requirements  of  its  media  professionals  for  their  information  seeking  and  information  production.

3. TV  MEDIA  IN  BENGALURU

The  steady  growing  of  numerous  satellite  TV  channels,  cable  operators  and  direct  to  home services available at Bengaluru now has spoilt for  choice. Doordarshan is the broadcaster of the Government  of  India  and  its  channel  DD  Chandana  is  dedicated  to  Kannada.

4. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Previous studies, literature on the subject of sources,  modes of collecting information by the media professionals  and  other  professional’s  information  requirement  have  been  reviewed.  
One of the earliest studies about usage of libraries by  media professionals, Joseph1  stated that the journalists who  are working on the eight Kerala newspapers used libraries  for conducting research on their news, which were published  in the Kerala newspapers. Also the study concluded that  there was a separate room for improvement in the collections  and  services  of  the  media  libraries  concerned. 
Gupta2   conducted  a  study  on  information  needs  and  information  and  sought  behaviour  of  print  and  electronic  media  journalists  in  Madhya  Pradesh  with  special reference to Rewa division. The study finds that  maximum  numbers  of  journalists  were  graduate,  most  of  number  of  journalist  preferred  to  visit  personally  to  obtain information, highest number of respondents desired  to avail library services free of cost and few journalists  prefer fee-based library services in both print media and  electronic  media. 
Obijiofor3   carried  out  a  study  on  news  channels  professionals  perceptions  and  use  of  the  internet  as  a  news  channel.  The  study  revealed  that  news  channels  professionals relied basically on internet as most popular  source for news. The study also stated that news channels  professionals  were  highly  selective  of  the  news  media  for  satisfying  their  news  needs. 
Singh4  in a study examined the information behaviour  of  newspapers  journalists  working  at  New  Delhi.  Study  found that different categories of journalists used various  types of sources for acquiring the needed information. The  periodicals, news magazines, current issues of newspapers,  clipping  files  and  dictionaries/biographical  dictionaries  are most frequently used sources of information by them.  The  main  difficulties  faced  by  newspaper  journalists  are lack of modern communication gadgets, information  scattered  in  many  sources,  lack  of  time  to  look  for  or  
238 
read  information,  information  not  readily  available  and  inadequate  library  services  and  sources. 
McCollough5   in  his  study  stated  that  resources  for  local  journalism  outlets  are  on  the  decline  and  the  use  of  digital  tools  are  on  the  rise,  there  have  been  greater  consideration of the audience among journalists, editors,  and foundations. Researcher introduced three themes such  as,  (a)  self-reliant  news  consumer,  (b)  lack  of  citizen  journalism, and (c) continued importance of interpersonal  networks.  These  themes  may  provide  insights  into  the  nature  of  local  news  consumers. 
5. OBJECTIVES 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
(a) Identify  the  various  types  of  information  resources  
available  for  media  professionals 
(b) Know  the  awareness  level  of  media  professionals  
with  response  to  different  information  resources  
available 
(c) Study the purpose of information seeking by media  
professionals 
(d) Know about the factors responsible for information  
gathering 
(e) Find out difficulties and barriers faced by television media  
professionals  while  accessing  the  information.

8.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based  on  the  findings  the  following  suggestions  are  made  to  improve  the  services  provided  by  media  libraries.  To  satisfy  the  information  requirement  by  the  media  professionals  media  libraries  have  to  review  and  regularly analyse the resources and ICT infrastructure as  internet  is  one  of  major  source  of  information. 
  It  is  recommended  that  all  Television  Medias’  should  establish  a  state  of  the  art  library  for  media  professionals  to  fulfil  the  complex  need  of  the  user.  To  improve  the  services  and  facilities  of  the  library  it  is  recommended that the libraries shall adopt the practice of  taking  feedback  from  the  users  by  circulating  an  online  questionnaire  which  will  certainly  help  strengthen  the  library  resources  and  services. 
9. CONCLUSIONS 
Media  professionals  usually  consult  the  source  and  channel  which  is  easily  available  and  accessible.  Most  of their work assignments need information seeking from  specialised  sources  of  information.  Media  professionals  need  good  library  facilities  and  services  as  well  as  online  data  facilities.  This  study  found  that  library  and  specialised  collations  are  the  main  channels  of  information  in  use.  Media  professionals  in  this  study  also  commonly  use  the  libraries,  as  they  are  easily  accessible  and  important  channel  of  information  and  also television media professionals’ information seeking  behaviour  is  very  distinct  and  pronounced  as  compared  to  other  professionals.  Similarly,  it  is  also  noted  that  program  based  information  sources  is  the  most  used
