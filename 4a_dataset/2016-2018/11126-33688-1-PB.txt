The present study is citation analysis of Business Research. It covers 18  issues of 9 volumes of Business  Research  published bi-annually during the period 2008-2016. The analysis covers the study of citation pattern and  chronological growth citations. It also covers authorship pattern of the articles and various information sources of  cited material. On the basis of citation analysis, a rank list of journals is prepared and core journals in the feld of  Business research are identifed. Similarly, core areas of research are identifed. The study reveals that researchers  have cited journals (77.33%) more than books, editorial works and all other sources of information. Growth in  collaborative trend of writing papers is also noticed as citations contributed by two authors is (37.67%) and single  authors is (33.42%) followed by three authors (21.59%). Half-life of journal’s citations is found to be fourteen  years. Bradford’s law doesn’t found ft in the study. Academy of Management Journal  (157 citations),  Strategic  Management Journal  (141 citations) and  The Journal of Finance  (136 citations) are the most cited journals. Supply  chain management and advertising are the two main areas of research among researchers.

1.  IntroduCtIon 
Business  research  is  a  field  of  practical  study  in  which  a  company  obtains  data  and  analyses  it  in  order  to  better  manage  the  company.  Business  research  can  include financial data, consumer feedback, product research  and competitive analysis. Executives and managers who  use  this  analysis  of  business  research  are  able  to  better  understand  their  company,  the  position  it  holds  in  the  market  and  how  to  improve  that  position1.  There  are  various  problems  faced  by  business  related  to  brand  image, market characteristics, market potential, and market  share  and  so  on.  Business  research  helps  entrepreneurs  to face the challenges of changing business environment.  It enables business to understand the social, cultural and  economical  framework  for  the  success  of  the  business.  Business  research  helps  in  understanding  the  complex  characteristics  of  the  environments  that  influence  the  various  decisions  of  business.  
Scholars  usually  defines  Citation  analysis  as  the  study of the impact and assumed quality of an article, a  journal, an author or an institution based on the number  of times works and/or authors have been cited by others2.  The  field  of  business  research  has  been  of  interest  to  business professionals and researchers as topic of scholarly  inquiry.  Despite  the  growth  of  business  research  field  little analysis has been done to explore the development  of  the  field.  It  is  important  to  measure  the  authorship  pattern, types of information sources, half-life of journal’s  citations,  applicability  of  Bradford’s  law,  core  journals,  etc.,  that  has  shaped  the  evolution  of  this  field.

The present study deals with the citation analysis of  Business  Research,  a  Journal  of  the  German  Academic  Association for Business Research in the field of business  published by Springer International Publishing. Business  Research  publishes  high-quality  articles  covering  both  traditional  fields  of  business  administration  and  cross- functional,  multidisciplinary  research  that  reflects  the  complex  character  of  business  problems.  It  has  started  its  publication  in  the  year  2008.  It  is  a  bi-annual,  open  access journal available both in print and online format.  It  is  indexed  in  Google  Scholar,  OCLC  and  Summon  by ProQuest. The  journal  has  been  selected  for  citation  analysis  because  it  has  grown  in  status  and  set  its  own  standards  in  publishing  articles  devoted  to  developing  novel perspectives or exploring new domains of research.  It was interesting to study the citations of such a leading  journal  in  the  areas  to  measure  the  authorship  pattern,  types of information sources, age of information sources,  core  journals  in  the  field,  applicability  of  Bradford’s  law,  etc. 
2. lIterAture revIews 
Regardless  of  how  scholars  view  the  citation,  they  agree  on  citation  practices  being  an  important  object  of  study  in  scholarly  communication  and  the  sociology  of  science. This has resulted in studies of citations, especially  on a quantitative level, having grown rapidly during the  last  decades,  not  least  for  evaluative  purposes3.  
Gunaseka4  conducted a citation analysis of postgraduates'  theses in the field of Economics. He analysed 16 masters  and  2  doctoral  dissertations  and  found  that  the  age  of  

========1========

DJLIT, VOL.  37,  NO.  4,  JULY  2017 
most of the cited materials were 20 years old or less in  age and the maximum citations were noted during 1991  to  2000.  The  study  also  found  that  most  of  citations  were  from  foreign  journals. 
In  an  another  study  conducted  by  Guidry5,  et  al.  a  rank  list  of  economics  journals  was  prepared  and  concluded that Journal of Marketing Research ,  Journal of  Marketing,  Journal of Consumer Research and  Marketing  Science  were the most frequently used journals.  McKee 
6,  assessed 3 leading international auditing journals through  citation  analysis  during  2001-2006.  Journals  for  this  study incudes Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory, Managerial Auditing Journal  and  International  Journal  of  Auditing.  He  concluded  that  9  topics  accounted  for  80%  of  the  articles  examined.  
Singh, Bebi & Garg7  discussed the citation pattern of  PhD theses in Social sciences awarded by the University  of  Delhi  during  1995-2008.  They  concluded  that  books  were  the  most  cited  information  source  all  disciplines  except  economics  and  constitutes  about  55.5%  of  total  citations.  They  also  concluded  that  most  of  the  cited  literature  (86%)  were  contributed  by  single  author  and  Economic and Political Weekly  was the most frequently  used journal among researchers. Another study conducted  by  Garg  &  Anjana8   analysed  605  papers  published  in  the  Journal  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights   during  1996-2012,  which  indicates  that  the  inflow  of  papers  has  increased  during  the  period  of  study.  They  found  an  increasing  trend  in  number  of  references  per  paper  and  average  reference  per  paper  was  23.  They  also  found  that  most  of  the  papers  were  contributed  by  more  than  one  author.  Academic  institutions  were  the  largest contributors followed by research institutions  and  CSIR  was  top  contributor  of  papers  and  several  of  the  prolific  institutions  and  authors  were  also  affiliated  from  CSIR.  
Meera  &  Ali9   conducted  a  citation  analysis  of  
the  period  2004  to  2009.  Like  many  other  studies,  they  also  found  that  journals  are  the  most  cited  sources,  and  based  on  the  pattern  of  citations,  this  paper  developed  a  ranking  list  of  journals.  In  application  of  Bradford's  law,  he  found  that  the  top  48  journals  that  were  ranked  among  the  30  most  used  journals  contributed  to  more  than  55%  of  the  journal  citations. 
3.   oBJ eCtIves 
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to:  
(a) Examine  the  growth  of  articles  and  citations  in  
Business  Research 
(b) Identify  the  categories  of  information  resources  of  
citations  in  Business  Research 
(c) Examine  the  authorship  pattern  in  the  citations  of

4. Methodology 
Data  for  this  study  consists  of  citations  appended  to the contributed research papers published in Business  Research  during the period 2008-2016. Each citation was  examined  to  know  the  subject  area  of  citation`,  type  of  information source of citations, chronological growth of  citations,  numbers  of  authors  who  have  contributed  to  each  research  paper.  For  conducting  the  study,  details  regarding  each  citation  such  as  title  of  article,  number  of  authors,  year  of  publication,  name  of  journals,  etc.,  was  scanned  and  the  relevant  information  was  recorded  and  analysed  for  making  observations.  A  database  was  prepared  in  MS-Excel,  containing  all  the  information  related to each citation. Once the database was completed  
Journal  of  American  Society  for  Information  Science  
the  information  contained  in  it  was  grouped,  tabulated  
and  Technology   and  found  that  journals  were  the  most  frequently  cited  information  source,  followed  by  books  and conference proceedings. Average citation per article  was  47.76,  half-life  of  journal  literature  was  7  years  and most of the citations were contributed by more than  one  author.  Mittal  and  Pillania10   studied  the  progress  of  research  on  business  research  in  India.  They  found  that  there  is  growing  number  of  research  literature  on  the  theme.  Most  prolific  journals  were,  Management  
and  analysed. 
5.   dA tA  An AlysIs  And  Interpret AtIon 
5.1. Citation pattern  of research papers  
An  attempt  was  made  to  calculate  the  amount  of  literature  that  has  been  produced  by  the  journal  during  the year 2008-2016. Total 98 articles with 6233 citations  were  published  in  these  9  years.  Along  with  this,  total  
Decision,   International  Journal  of  Human  Resource  
citations per volume, average citation per article has been  
Management,   Harvard  Business  Review  and  Journal  of  International Marketing. They also found that top 10% of  the  journals  are  responsible  for  36%  of  all  publications  and  the  top  7  authors  are  responsible  for  about  15%  of  all publications where as the top ten institutions account  for  30%  of  all  publications.  
Another study on doctoral dissertations conducted by  Kumar & Dora11  of doctoral dissertations at IIMA. They  analysed the citations of the 49 doctoral dissertations over  
282 
calculated  and  the  results  have  been  shown  in  Table  1.  No  significant  variation  was  observed  in  number  of  articles  published  every  year,  the  annual  output  ranged  between  10  to  12  articles  per  year.  As  far  as  citations  are concerned, total number of citations per volume and  average  citation  per  article  varies  significantly.  Highest  number  of  average  citations  per  article  in  Business  Research   was  found  to  be  73.75  in  the  year  2016,  which  is  the  same  year  when  the  number  of  articles  is

5.2.  d istribution  of  Cited references  among  
different  Information sources 
Dispersion  of  source  literature  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  It  is  evident  that  researchers  have  preferred  journals  as  the  source  of  information,  it  occupies  the  first  position  as  reference  with  total  4820  citations,  i.e.,  77.33%  of  the  total  cited  references.  On  second  position,  come  books  with  719  citations  (11.54%).  Rest  of  the  11.13%  is distributed among other information sources which are  editorial  works,  websites,  working  papers,  conferences/ symposium/workshops, and other resources (handbooks,  reports/technical reports, thesis/dissertations, magazines,  encyclopedia,  newspaper,  etc.) 
5.3. Authorship pattern  of  Citations    
Analysis of citations in Business Research , in relation  to  the  number  of  authors  is  presented  in  Table  2.  It  reveals  that  nearly  one  third  of  total  citations,  i.e.,

33.42%, were contributed by single author while the rest  of  it  is  contributed  by  more  than  one  author.  Maximum  cited material is contributed by two authors, accounting  for 2348 citations (37.67%), followed by three authors’  contribution accounting for 1346 citations (21.59%) and  finally  456  citations  (7.32%)  are  contributed  by  more  than three authors. More number of collaborative papers  indicates  that  the  collaborative  nature  of  research  is  growing.  Complexity  and  scale  of  modern  investigation  explains  the  need  for  the  collaboration. 
5.4.  h alf-life  of  Journals’  Citations 
Half-life  is  calculated  by  counting  the  number  of  year  in  which  50%  of  the  active  literature  is  reached  when  counted  from  the  base  year12.  To  estimate  the  half-life,  median  age  of  journal’s  citation  is  calculated.  The  half-life  was  found  to  be  approximately  fourteen  years.  This  indicates  that  authors  in  Business  Research  have  used  current  literature.  As  the  table  reveals  50%  of  journal’s  articles  fall  under  the  category  of  year  2001-2010 which means that half-life of journal citations  is  about  14  years  (Table  3).

5.5. Applicability  of  Bradford’s law 
From  the  data  analysis,  it  has  been  found  that  864  journals  have  been  cited  by  the  authors.  For  testing  the  Bradford’s  law  journal’s  citations  have  been  divided  into three zones. The study identified 19 journals as the  nucleus journals that were cited most by the researchers  of  the  citing  journal  (Table  4).  
From  analysis,  it  was  found  that,  first  19  journals  covered 1628 articles (33.78%), next 86 journals covered  1610  articles  (33.40%)  and  rest  759  journals  covered

remaining  1582  articles  (32.82  articles).  Bradford’s  zone  is  also  depicted  in  the Table  5.  Here  the  observed  distribution  is  19:86:759  for  a  total  of  864  journals  and  the  expected  distribution  is  19:19(6.68):19(6.68)2.  Bradford’s multiplier, i.e., 6.68 in the expected distribution  is  obtained  by  dividing  the  number  of  journals  of  a  particular zone by number of journals of preceding zone  as  depicted  in  Fig.  2. 
Expected  distribution  =  19:  19(6.68):  19(6.68)2 
%  of  error  =  (993-864)/864  =  14.93% 
The  %  of  error  is  14.93%  which  is  not  a  good  approximation.  Hence  Bradford’s  law  doesn’t  fits  in  this  data  set.

5.6.  Core  Journals  in  Business research 
In  the  present  study,  total  864  journals  have  been  cited  for  4820  citations  out  of  total  6233  citations.  It  was not difficult to analyse the journals which were cited  most  frequently  as  1671  citations  out  of  4820  journal  citations  are  from  20  journals.  It  is  worth  to  note  that  these first 20 journals in the rank list cover nearly 35%  of total journal citations. Rest 65% is scattered amongst  844  journals.  Table  6  provides  an  overall  rank  list  of  cited journals in which top twenty journals are arranged

6. ConClusIons 
Citation  analysis  of  all  98  articles  in  18  issues  of  9 volumes of Business Research  published during 2008- 2016  has  been  presented  in  the  study.  It  was  found  that  there  is  growth  in  average  citation  per  article  since  volume  1,  however  there  is  decline  in  average  citation  per article in year 2013 and 2015. Maximum number of  citations  (883)  were  found  in  the  year  2016,  whereas  the  minimum  citations  (513)  were  found  in  the  year  2008.
