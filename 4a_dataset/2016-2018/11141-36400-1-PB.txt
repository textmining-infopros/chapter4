issues and challenges 
1.  IntrOduCtIOn 
Massive  open  online  courses  (MOOCs)    are latest  e-Learning  initiative  utilising  modern  technology and widely investigated advance in  distance  education  that  developed  over  time  as  a  prevalent  mode  of  learning.  Siemens  and  Downes  coined  the  term  MOOCs,  where maximum number of apprentices can get enrolled from  anywhere  across  the  globe.  MOOCs  comprise  of  wide  and  assorted  content,  contributed  to  by  multiple  subject  specifc  experts,  educationalists,  and  mentors,  accumulated  into  a  central  repository,  such  as  a  website.  The  unique  feature  of  MOOCs is that, the content can be remixed. Thus, ‘the content  doesn’t  need  not  to  be  designed  to  go  together  but  become  linked with each other through MOOCs’1. MOOCs offer open  and  free  education  to  the  entire  community  where  learners  choose  from  diverse  range  of  courses  and  get  registered  in  the  course  of  their  choice  very  conveniently  at  their  place  and  without  wasting  time.  Enrolled  student  though  study  independently but at the same time they do collaborate with  their peers and experts across the globe. MOOCs proved to be  benefcial for individuals who fail to pursue education through  regular mode due to certain issues like scarcity of funds, lack  of opportunities, geographical location, etc.  
Pedagogically, MOOCs are designed to be tremendously  interactive  using  various  tools  like  blogs,  videos,  podcasts  and  forums  embedded  into  the  programs  to  engage  students  and help them to collaborate and solve real world problems  by conducting real debates and dialogues about various ideas,

concepts and theories used for peer review and assessment2. Information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  endowed  education  system  with  opportunities  through  web  based  learning  methods,  and  this  gave  rise  to  the  development  of  MOOCs3.  Wide  attention  from  mass  media;  entrepreneurial  vendors, education professionals and tech literate individuals  have  been  received  by  MOOCs  from  last  couple  of  years.  MOOCs actually came up with free access and provide course  that  brought  down  the  cost  of  higher  education.  From  open  access  to  open  web  based  courses,  there  is  increasing  drive  among higher education institutions to take part in the ‘open’  movement. Number of elite universities are now introducing  web  based  courses  by  setting  up  open  learning  platforms.  Commercial  start-ups  such  as  Coursera  and  Udacity  have  joined their hands with prestigious universities, offering free  or less charged online courses4. MOOCs underline openness in  relation to learners’ aptitude to access content online, in terms  of fee to access, in terms of open courseware, or with respect to  student group effort5.European Commission explain MOOCs  as ‘an online course open to anyone without restrictions (free  of charge and without a limit to attendance), usually structured  around a set of learning goals in an area of study, which often  runs over a specifc period of time (with beginning and end date)  on  an  online  platform  which  allows  interactive  possibilities  (between  peers  or  between  students  and  instructors)  that  facilitate the creation of a learning community. As it is the case  for any online course, it provides some course materials and  (self) assessment tools for independent studying’6. 
Various  authors  defne  it  as  a  ‘massive  model  of  educational delivery, with theoretically no limit to enrolment;

open, allowing anyone to participate, usually at no cost; online  withlearning activities typically taken place over the web; and  a course, structured around a set of learning goals in a defned  area of study’7,8. 
MOOCs  is  in  a  transitory  phenomenon,  ordained  by  higher education’s resistance to change and lack of fnancially  sustainable models, it has become clear that MOOCs are here  to dwell. As MOOCs progress, sponsors and courses alike are  mounting at a rapid rate. The effect of MOOCs on research  in higher education is lost in the hype. In fact, MOOCs have  stirred the higher education research. Harvard and MIT jointly  invested  $30  million  in  edX  by  means  of  opportunities  for  research as part of the rational for such a massive investment9.   MOOCs  aim  at  providing  open  access  online  lectures,  course  material  and  problem  sets  to  maximum  number  of  participants  through  web10.  MOOCs’  engrossed  worldwide  publicity  through  rapidly  growing  providers  and  platforms  thus declaring year 2012 ‘the year of MOOCs’ by New york  Times. In another study, researcher studied the motivation for  learners’ and mentors’ use of massive open online courses and  found aspiration to know about nascent topics or to update their  knowledge, curiosity about MOOCs or individual yearning to  collect as many certifcates for completed courses as possible  to  be  the  reason  and  motivation  for  learners  to  sign  up  for  MOOCs11. 
2.  Issues And CHAllenges  
MOOCs  as  an  open  access  educational  platform  have  elevated various concerns and criticisms in educational forum.   This subdivision scrutinises the issues and challenges for the  MOOCs: 
2.1 Quality 
Quality assurance is one of the major issues of MOOCs  for higher education. Compared to other web based courses,  MOOCs lack structure and hardly embrace the vital role of a  mentor or a teacher. MOOCs are autonomous learning platform  that is entirely different from formal education system. MOOCs  that are pretty open in nature develop a self-selected population  that is passionate and promised about this learning approach.  To make maximum of this platform, learners need to be digital  literates that raises the concerns on inclusivity and equality of  access. Margaryan12, et al. evaluated the instructional design  quality of MOOCs, the results reveal that majority of MOOCs  are good about the organisation and presentation of the course  material.  However,  number  of  MOOCs  score  below  par  on  instructional design policy. The results indicate that although  most MOOCs are well organised but their instructional design  quality is poor.  
According  to  Hew  &  Cheung11,  the  loose  structure  of  these courses makes it diffcult to assure its quality and even to  measure obtainable goals. Traditional instructors and trainers  disbelieving this format voice appropriate apprehension about  standards  and  quality  of  MOOCs.  Daniel13,  suggests  that  MOOCs need to make an approach to get the courses evaluated  by the learners and educators that can lead to a quality rank  table  of  courses  offered.  In  this  way,  the  courses  with  poor  rating  either  dissolve  due  to  less  demand  or  will  endure  by  
64 
recuperating course quality in response to poor scores. 
2.2 Completion rate 
The course withdrawal rate is another concern for MOOCs  and  much  argued  debate.  Although  thousands  of  learners  register for courses, but actually only few of them complete  the course. Various studies reveal that completion of MOOCs  classes are bleak as compared to traditional online education as  less than ten per cent of learners enrolled in MOOCs are found  to complete their course14-16.Despite growth in enrolment rate  of students in MOOCs courses, the average completion rate as  on 15th  July 2015 was 15 per cent 
15. Hew & Cheung11,  reveal  the reason behind 90 per cent dropout in MOOCs is dearth of  inducements,  inability  of  learners  to  comprehend  the  course  material available, lack of help when needed or many a times  learners having other priorities to fulfll. If learners come up  with the stimulus to merely learn some novel information and  do not look for any university credit, then the uniqueness of a  fresh set of ideas wears off as the work involved to complete  the  course  escalates. Also,  the  nature  of  the  media  used  to  access the course may be a distraction to dissuade participants  from concluding 
17. The dropout rate problem depends basically  on  the  perceived  intentions  of  MOOCs.  If  the  basic  aim  of  MOOCs  is  just  to  offer  opportunity  to  access  free  and  high  quality courses from leading higher educational institution and  professors, then high dropout rates may not be a crucial issue.  However, it is extensively agreed that it would be expedient to  mend the retention rates of MOOCs by fnding out the reason  for dropping out the courses by the learners 
18. 
2.3 Assessment  and  Credit  
MOOCs face diffculty to gauge and assess the students’  performance,  feeling  of  teaching  in  vacuum  due  to  the  lack  of  feedback  and  response  from  learners  and  lack  of  student  participation. The main assessment instrument used by most  MOOCs  to  gauge  learners  is  quizzes  where  multiple  choice  questions  with  programmed  answers  are  given.  Several  MOOCs put forward open ended questions for assessment and  support  individual  student’s  learning,  for  example  coursera-  that  comprise  of  submission  of  long  type  responses,  rated  through peer assessment. However, evaluating large number of  essay assignments is quite diffcult for one lecturer11.Jordan15,  reveals that maximum MOOCs providers use ‘auto grading’  assessment system for evaluating the learners and ‘peer grading’  is adopted by very less course providers. Apprehensions are also  conveyed around deception and copying with online learning,  especially where courses are entitled for academic credits.  
2.4   l anguage 
Language arbitrates the way a learner think and articulate.  Language profciency is a signifcant cross-cultural thing mainly  for non-native speakers19. Language barrier can be decreased  with  asynchronous  online  learning20.  English  language  considered as a global language is most commonly used around  the  world  with  one’s  mother  tongue  together.  Bilinguals  are  alleged to be better learners while non-english speakers may  face diffculty in using English language. This is perhaps prime  concern  for  MOOCs  providers21.  In  another  study,  author  

========2========

GuL, et al.: MOOCS: HypE AND  H OpE 
reveals  that  language  barrier can  affect  the  learning  process  of learners and also is one of the foremost dropout reasons in  MOOCs.  Therefore  learners  need  to  have  enough  language  learning aptitude to access MOOCs19.  Wright22, reveals that  english language remains to be dominant scholarly language in  many of the countries even if English is not spoken language  of the native people. Majority of MOOCs are produced and  offered in english language. For example, Coursera advertised  390 courses on its website out of which 363 were in English,  11 in Spanish, 09 in French, 05 in Chinese, 01 in German, and  01 in Italian. Udacity and edX is found to offer only english  language  courses23.  However,  the  share  of  English  language  courses were reduced a bit from 80 per cent to 75 per cent by  the rise of some region specifc MOOC providers like FUN and  MiriadaX. Spanish and French are second biggest languages in  which MOOCs are offered after English and currently courses  are offered in only 16 languages24. Strategies are ahead to get  the  selected  MOOCs  translated  for  Coursera25;  however  the  effectiveness  of  translation  of  language  with  no  appropriate  modifcations might well hamper the overall accessibility of  the  learning  resources.  Translation  of  selected  courses  may  also lead to the dominance of those translated subjects26. The  language issue may be unintended; but it does pass on messages  that can be considered to be valuable.  
2.5   l imited  Internet Access 
Access to steady and uninterrupted electricity supply and  internet connection, with good bandwidth at reasonably good  price do not exist with equity across the people of developing  countries and this issue may not be taken in account or may be  taken for granted by MOOCs providers27. Internet connection in  many of the countries remains to be excessively high compared  to  their  average  annual  income.  In  New  Zealand,  ‘internet  access is not pervasive; quarter of homes still do not have access  to the internet and one ffth don’t have a computer’28. Some  governments are taking initiatives to make available maximum  internet access to people through the provision of cyber cafes  and in terms of stimulating opportunities for extended study,  to access cyber learning opportunities26. However, these still  appear to remain limiting factors.  
3. COnClusIOns    
MOOCs provide an opportunity to groom the intellectual  capacities  of  people  at  mass  level.  Offering  courses  at  the  doorstep  of  learners  it  has  shaken  the  barriers  of  time  and  space which is much evident in traditional educational system.  Learners  from  remote  place  are  able  to  get  connected  with  educators across the globe. They are able to hold discussions  and interactive with people from diverse culture and ideologies.   To make universal education dream come true, there is a need  to  look  at  apprehensions  which  researchers  have  identifed  in  the  existing  online  learning  environment.  National  and  international  accreditation  councils  should  be  put  in  place  to  check  and  validate  the  course  contents.  To  get  the  wider  audience, people at social platforms should be encouraged to  translate the course in different language and to least develop  subtitles in different languages to multimedia content. Though  active participation in online courses has been witnessed but so  
far pass out percentage is not much promising. The language  of the contents should be simple, lucid, and easy to understand  and comprehend. Further, there need to be fexibility in time  line of courses. Users should be able to take the courses as and  when they desire to and should have liberty to complete the  courses at their own pace. Since courses are delivered online,  contents should be created in such formats that require least  internet bandwidth and should be operable at low end android  and  other  property  electronic  gadgets.  MOOCs  are  foreseen  future  of  our  education  system;  we  need  to  be  cautions  and  wise  to  canvass  the  learning  environment  of  our  upcoming  generations.
