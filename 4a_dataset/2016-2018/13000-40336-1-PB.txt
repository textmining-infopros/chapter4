Health  science  research  focuses  to  generate  new  knowledge  through  new  technique,  research  design  and  organisational interventions to serve the whole community. The corporate Medical colleges are determined to establish  themselves in both academic and research purpose. The performance index (P-index) is an interesting parameter  to calculate the ranking performance of any institution. This study presents an analysis of the research growth,  collaboration of researchers with ranking of the corporate medical institutes in India according to p-index. 
Keywords: Corporate medical institutions; P-index; Bibliometrics; Scopus; h-index; India 
1. INtRODUCtION 
Until  the  early  1980s,  higher  education  on  health  care  was  provided  by  the  institutions  funded  by  the  government.  During the last three decades several institutions managed by  the trusts or societies or corporate sector have emerged which  corporate medical education in India. These institutions were  started  after  obtaining  permission  from  the  concerned  state  governments, government of India as well as Medical Council  of India (MCI). It is found from the website of MCI (http:// newmciindia.org/) that there are 226 corporate medical college  in India. This study reveals that 116 medical colleges are in  south region of India where 35 college are in Karnataka and it  is highest in the whole country. There are 44 institution in the  western region. Maharashtra is on the top having 27 college  in that state. UP is on the top in northern part of India with 21  institution. There  is  more  participation  of  corporate  medical  colleges in Indian health care sector. They are taking a larger  participation in producing health manpower in India, though,  there is no such difference between corporate medical colleges  and  government  medical  colleges  in  terms  of  infrastructure  facility, national and international exposure, clinical facilities  and performance.  In this study, an attempt has been made to  analyse the performance and ranking of these corporate medical  institutions in India using P-Index. 
2. LItERAtURE REVIEW 
In the past several bibliometric studies have been made.  Subbiah Arunachalam (1999) in his macroscopic study used  standard scientometrics techniques to map the published life  sciences  articles  in  India  during  1992  –  1994  and  presents  the  Indian  research  (life  sciences)  in  different  sub-felds  with  a  strong  approach  towards  the  collaboration  of  authors  in native and abroad. This study reveals that 64.5 per cent of

research article are contributed by the academicians1. Subbiah  Arunachalam (1997) identifed the most preferred journals by  the Indian health science researchers to publish their research  experience  within  the  major  subjects  of  medical  sciences  to  indicate the mortality and morbidity causes based on the data  from “Medline” to show the contribution of different Indian  institutions  situated  at  different  states  and  cities.  He  also  collected data both from SCI and Medline database to identify the  major sub-felds in Medical sciences in which the Indian health  science researchers are interested to publish their manuscript2.  Huffman  et  al.  (2013)  downloaded  the  research  articles,  number of citations etc. from the Thomson Reuter’s web of  knowledge for their study during 1999 - 2008. They compared  all the data and found a signifcant result with p value <0.053.  Garg and Rag (1988) has made a study in the feld of science.  They analysed the documents published both in the SCI and  non SCI journals during the period of 1965–19824. Similarly,  Koganuramath et al. (2002) analysed 663 research publications  of Tata Institute of Social Sciences during 1990–2000. They  observed  that  scientists  were  more  conscious  of  publishing  their research results in more reputed journals but their aim was  to show a better result on the bibliometrics growth of research  articles5. Kumbar et al. (2008) retrieved their data from Scopus  database  during  1996–2006  on  research  publication  in  the  feld of Science and Technology of the University of Mysore.  They evaluate and analysed 1516 research article and observed  that  the  average  annual  growth  rate  of  that  University  is  23  per cent6. Grace & Jeyshankar (2015) retrieved 1764 records  from  SCOPUS  to  analyse  through  different  scientometrics  parameters  like:  source  wise,  collaboration  pattern,  growth  rate  of  documents  etc7.  Velmurgan  &  Natrajan  (2017)  used  collaborative index, citation index, source index etc. to analyse  2622 record retrieved from WoS8. Kolle & Shankarappa (2016)  found 4780 suitable record from WoS to fnd the productive  journals, collaborating countries and institutions with citation

These  studies  deal  with  scientometric  assessment  of  Indian science and technology by many researchers. Besides  these,  some  studies  dealt  with  bibliometric  assessment  of  medical  and  life  sciences.  Some  studies  are  also  related  to  different engineering institutions in India. However, no study  has been reported in literature that dealt with corporate medical  institutions  in  India. The  present  study  is  an  attempt  in  that  direction. 
3. ObJECtIVEs  OF  tHE stUDY 
 The main objectives of the study are as follows. • Identify and analyse the average growth rate of the top 10  
corporate medical institutes based on their publications • Analyse the performance and ranking of top 10 corporate  
medical institute 
• Identify  most  preferred  journals  by  the  Indian  health  
science researchers 
• Analyse  the  global  collaboration  of  the  Indian  health  
science researchers. 
       
4. MEtHODOLOGY 
There are many ways to calculate ranking performance of  institutions. The simplest way is using the quantity of output (P)  and the citations obtained (C), and impact (i = C/P) or someone  can do this by a performance index combining quantity and  quality,  i.e.  h-index.  Some  recent  studies  have  revisited  the  problem  of  ranking  performance  of  any  institutions.  The  geometric mean of C and C/P can be used as the best single  indicator  to  rank  any  institution,  taking  consideration  of  both  quality  and  quantity  of  publications  of  the  concerned  institutions.  It  can  be  shown  that  this  has  the  dimension  of  h3/2. We can defne the mock h-index as hm= (C2/P)(1/3)  (Pratap  & Gupta, 2011). It can be used as the substitute of the best  indicator for performance with the correct dimension of h. This  index is termed as p-index10. We have to discuss about the term  C2/P=C×C/P. The impact i=C/P and the number of citation (C)  is used again to calculate the energy of those institutions. This  formula is (E= iC = C2/P) and this interpretation is useful to  display the research performance of various institutions on a  two dimensional map.  
Performance  ranking  of  international  institutions  is  based on both quality & quantity of scientifc research which  is a very complex exercise. P-index is introduced for ranking  performance of different corporate medical colleges & hospitals  which is introduced in last few years. According to the Medical  Council of India, there are 226 corporate medical college &  Hospital in India11,12.  
The data presented in this study has been accessed from  SCOPUS  (http://www.scopus.com)  and  the  top  10  corporate  medical college with more number of publications in comparison  to others during the period of study i.e. 2007-2016 has been  taken. The total numbers of 20743 bibliographic record were  gathered from Scopus database because it comprises a huge  number of publishers & multi-disciplinary subjects.

5.3 Performance  of top ten  Indian  Corporate  
Medical  Institute 
There  are  about  20743  papers  published  by  the  top  10  corporate  medical  institute/college  from  India  during  the  period  2007-2016.  These  medical  institutes  were  identifed  and selected according to productive publication ranging from  1173 paper to 4080 paper. The citation received by publications  of these Indian corporate medical colleges is taken to calculate  the average number of citations per paper for each institute. The  h-index of these corporate medical colleges are retrieved from  Scopus and presented for study during these 10 year. Table 3  represents the overall status of 10 corporate medical college  & hospital, i. e the number of publications (P), the citations  received during the studied period (C), and the mean value of  citation known as impact (i=C/P). (Table 3) also represents the  h-index  and  appropriately  introduced  performance  index  (p)  which is calculated using (C2/P)(1/3).  The performance ranking  of institutions has been done in (Table 3) using the p -index.  As  we  have  already  discussed  about  the  energy,  which  is
