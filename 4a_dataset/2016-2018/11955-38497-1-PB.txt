aBstract 
The study set out to examine the researchers’ perception towards the use JSTOR database and to explore the  reasons not to use JSTOR database. The present study carried out using simple random sampling technique. The  major purpose of researchers to use JSTOR was research work and article title was the most common searching  techniques in simple search category. In advanced search technique feld search was most common search technique  followed by phrase search. Almost, all respondents found satisfed with the service of JSTOR and none was found  dissatisfed/partially satisfed. On the basis of fndings, it is recommended that the use of JSTOR database can be  
maximised, if researchers have frequent literacy programs.

1.  IntroductIon 
Wu and Chen1  states that compared to available traditionally  printed sources, e-resources provide more convenient access,  easy to locate and also downloadable feature make them more  familiar among research/academic community. In the present  era  of  digital  information,  electronic  journals  witnessed  a  well-established  means  of  information  transmission  among  scientists,  researchers,  students  etc.  Now  days,  libraries  of  higher  educational  institutes  and  research  organisations  are  providing  various  electronic  sources  to  their  users  such  as  e-books,  e-magazines,  e-newspapers,  databases,  repositories  and so on. In fact, electronic journals dominate and preferred  to  all  these  e-resources.  For  any  researcher,  e-journals  one  considered as a prime/core sources of information.  According  to  Association  of  College  and  Research  Libraries2,  it  was  estimated that there are about more than 20,000 double peer  reviewed journals published across the globe and over 7,000  are  published  in  electronic  form. As  Erdamar  and  Demirel3 describes, in the recent past, there has been a drastic shift in  the information seeking patterns of researchers/scholars.  He  further points out that today electronic journal and other digital  information sources increasingly constitute a research tool for  researchers and scientists. 
2.  Background InformatIon 
Today,  the  trend  of  using  information  source  has  been  drastically  shifted  from  print  sources  to  electronic  sources.  With the advent of internet, these sources have recently become  very  popular  among  academic  and  research  communities.

Smith4 noted that with the variation and increasing number of  electronic sources of information, libraries are tending to allot  more amounts to subscribe these sources. The Maulana Azad  Library of Aligarh Muslim University also subscribes a long  list  of  e-resources. Among  all  e-resources,  JSTOR  Database  has  been  selected  for  the  present  study,  because  the  other  related  databases  had  already  been  covered  including  their  various aspects but no study has been taken so for to assess  users’ perception towards using JSTOR.  
Under  the  direction  of  the  University  of  Michigan,  a  project  was  launched  in  1995,  this  project  ended  with  the  establishment  of  JSTOR  as  an  independent  not-for-proft  organisation.  In  2009,  JSTOR  merged  with  and  became  a  service  of  ITHAKA.  Presently,  the  JSTOR  listed  a  total  of  3709 journals title and among all titles about 416 journals title  belongs to various branches studies. 
The Faculty of Social Science was set up in 1969 with  nine  departments.  Today,  the  faculty  comprises  of  fourteen  Departments/Centers  and  Interdisciplinary  Centre  for  Development Studies. The faculty is offering 8 undergraduate  and  20  post  graduate  programs  apart  from  various  Diploma  and Certifcate Courses.

4.   s cope and LImItatIons 
Maulana Azad Library subscribes a variety of electronic  sources  to  facilitate  its  user.  Present  study  confned  to  the  users’  perception  toward  the  JSTOR  database.  The  present  study is further limited to research scholars of Faculty of Social  Science, AMU. 
5.   m ethodoLogy 
The  present  study  is  survey  based  study.  For  this  purpose, simple random sampling technique was used. A total  of  165  questionnaire  were  distributed  among  the  research  scholars. However, 131 questionnaire were received from the  researchers. Thus, 79.39 per cent response rate was achieved.  Then, the collected data was manually counted and ftted in  MS  Excel  sheet  for  further  calculations  and  preparation  of  graphs and tables. Finally, the tabulated data was copied to MS  Word, where the data was interpreted and fndings of the study  presented. 
6. LIterature revIew 
Arshad  and  Ameen5   employed  a  survey  on  academics  of  Punjab  University  (Lahore)  to  explore  the  pattern  of  use  of  e-journals.  The  researcher  observed  that  academicians  frequently  use  e-journals,  online  reference  sources,  reading  abstracts etc. to fll their research activity and teaching tasks.  They  basically  obtained  research  articles  from  open  access  sources and rarely consulted subscribed sources of information.  It was found that electronic journals were dominant among all  types of online sources of information. A similar study was also  taken by bhat and ganaie6  to determine some segments while  using  electronic  information  resources  (EIRs)  by  scientists,  research  scholar  and  Pg   students.  The  results  showed  that  their  most  common  place  of  using  EIRs  were  department/ offce,  hostels,  home  etc. The  study  reported  that  almost  all  participants  searched  information  through  their  own  laptops  followed by desktops. In case of simple search, they used title  search followed by keywords and in case of advanced search  they used boolean operator followed by quotation mark, wild  card and truncation search. 
Leduce and Sehapfel7  compared the usage of e-resources  among  top  ranked  French  business  Schools  such  as  HEC,  ESSEC, INSEAD. The study pointed out that the usage appears  to  be  comparatively  intensive,  especially  when  compared  to  usage statistic from universities in the same feld. The authors  recommended  that  business  schools  should  increase  usage  and effciency of subscribed digital resources. Another study  carried  out  by  Wu  and  Chen7   on  electronic  resources.  They  explored  graduate  students  perception  towards  e-resources  and  their  usage  pattern. They  found  that  student  were  using  e-resources  frequently  especially  during  the  time  of  thesis  writing. The students of science and technology perceived that  e-resources  are  more  important  to  their  research  work,  than  students of other discipline do.  
Kumar8  conducted a study on the usage of e-resources by  the students of medical science, engineering and management in  bangalore city. They all were found to be aware of e-resources  and  internet.  Their  major  purpose  to  use  e-resources  was  academic related work. Some of the participant preferred print  
sources to e-resources. Lastly, the authors opined that librarians  need  to  expand  the  availability  of  electronic  resources  for  the students and faculties. One more similar study set out by  guager and Kacena9  to inspect what effects institutional size  and  the  selection  of  JSTOR  collection  have  on  the  overall  usage statistics. For this purpose, they identifed fve academic  libraries approximately equal in size, and then the researchers  compared  JSTOR  log  data  among  selected  libraries.  In  the  study,  the  authors  found  that  the  size  of  the  institution  infuence the overall data usage statistics. It also revealed that  information literacy programs made a greater infuence on the  use of JSTOR database. 
7.    r esuLts and dIscussIon 
7.1   u sers  of jstor database 
Table 1 shows that out of 131 respondent 85 participant  uses JSTOR database and 46 respondent does not use JSTOR  database. As shown in the Table 1, the number of males (48)  are  greater  than  females  (37)  in  case  the  usage  of  JSTOR  database.

7.2   r easons  not  to  use jstor 
The  participants  were  asked  to  mention  reason  behind  not to use JSTOR database. As displayed in Table 2 that 46  participant do not use JSTOR, because they don’t know JSTOR  database  and  10  participant  are  found  aware  about  JSTOR  database, but they prefer other database. The percentage share  of  reasons  constitutes  as  78.26  per  cent  and  21.74  per  cent  respectively.  Furthermore,  female  are  found  more  unaware  about JSTOR than the male.

7.3   r easons  to  use jstor 
The  JSTOR  database  is  one  of  the  prime  source  of  information  for  the  researchers  of  humanities  and  other  sciences which provide a millions of peer reviewed documents  for the purpose of research and other academic task. Therefore,  the participants were asked to determine the major reason to  use it. The results on this question appeared quite similar in  both genders. As revealed in Table 3 that 33 participant use  JSTOR database for its authenticity followed by 31 participants  for  its  easy  access  and  22  participant  use  because  of  its  multidisciplinary nature. Other reasons are good interface by 16  participant, relevancy in available literature by 15 participant

7.4   e xperience  of jstor 
The  most  important  and  stunning  aspect  of  assessing  the  using  pattern  of  any  database  is  the  familiarity  of  the  particular database among users. If, the users are not familiar  with the particular database, than the study will not serve any  purpose. For the accomplishment of this task a question was  placed for the respondents. Results, regarding the familiarity  of  JSTOR  database  between  male  and  female,  the  later  one  category appeared to have more experience than earlier one.  Jointly,  the Table  4  points  out  that  21  participants  have  1-2  years’  experience  of  using  JSTOR  database  and  the  same  number of participators have 6 month to 1 years’ experience.  20 respondents seem to have less than 6 months’ experience  whereas other 20 participants were reported to have more than  two years’ experience of using JSTOR database.

7.5   t ime spent time 
A  question  was  asked  on  weekly  spent  time  for  the  purpose to reach a conclusion that which group of users spends  more time in browsing this database. In case of weekly spent  time for locating information from JSTOR Database, again the  female surmount the male. Among all given options, female  participants spend more time than male. As indicated in Table  5 that more than half of the partakers i.e. 45 spends less than  1 hour per week for accessing JSTOR database, followed by  26  participant  spends  3-4  hour/week  and  only  6  participant   spends  more than  7  hour/week. A  very  few  researchers i.e.  only  5  participant  spends  6-7  hour/week  in  using  JSTOR  database.

7.6   s imple search techniques 
Another, signifcant aspect of any database is the provision  of searching choices in a particular database. And the retrieval of  results is determined by the user friendly searching techniques.  The  JSTOR  provides  a  variety  of  searching  techniques  in  simple search category. Among all techniques, keyword search  takes top place in female category; on the other hand article title  search is appeared most common in male category. Collectively,  as pointed out in Table 6 that most common search technique  is keywords search by 32 participants followed by article title  search by 27 participants, author search by 12 participators and  subject search by 11 participants. besides, 12 participants use  all these techniques to locate their required information.

7.7   a dvanced search techniques 
Any database whether national or international, whether  it is citation and full text must provide some sort of searching  tools and techniques in advance searching techniques to dig  information from it. These searching tools works as a library  catalogue  helps  to  dig  information  from  a  library. Thus,  the  JSTOR  Database  also  provides  some  kinds  of  searching  techniques  to  locate  information.  Comparatively,  advance  search  techniques  are  little  more  technical  to  simple  search  techniques. Albeit, the participants in both categories also use  advance  search  methods  to  locate  information  from  JSTOR  database.  Among  all  advance  searching  techniques,  feld  search is found most preferred searching technique in in both  groups  equally  by  14  participants  each.  In  details,  it  can  be  seen in the table 7 it executes that phrase search is used by 23  participants and boolean operator is used by 13 participants.  Anyhow,  7  participants  is  used  all  of  these  techniques.  Surprisingly, none of the participant uses wild card technique.

7.8   p urpose  of  using jstor database 
Any  database  or  source  of  information  serves  multiple  purposes. It is user community that use if for different purpose  depending upon the users’ profession. In research communities  the purpose for using any database remains more or less same.   Here, the scholar of social science also uses JSTOR Database  primarily for research work and this purpose is almost same  between both genders. As disposed in Table 8 that more than  one  third  participant  i.e.  69  uses  JSTOR  database  for  their  research work, followed by domain knowledge and teaching  assignments by 23 and 1 participant, respectively. In addition  to this, near about one fourth of the participants uses JSTOR  database for some other purposes.

7.9   s atisfaction  Level  of users 
The  satisfaction  level  is  an  indispensible  phenomenon  in  any  service  provided  by  the  libraries.  The  assessment  of  users’ satisfaction level reveals the signifcance of a particular  information product. Therefore, Table 9 refects that not much  difference was found between male and female as far as the

level of satisfaction towards the use of JSTOR is concerned.   Satisfaction level was recorded maximum. As shown in Table  9, more than half of the researchers i.e. 42 researchers are found  partially satisfed and 39 researchers are found satisfed with  the use of JSTOR database. It is a matter of appreciation that  none of the researchers seem to be dissatisfed. Insignifcantly,  only a girl was appeared neutral and none of the participants in  both categories was found dissatisfed. 
8.    c oncLusIons 
At last, it can be said that JSTOR proved a key source  of information for researchers as well as other professionals.  Due  to  its  availability  at  their  door,  today  researchers  are  more  focused  on  e-journals  in  comparison  to  print  journals.  The  fndings  revealed  that  users  of  Maulana  Azad  Library  are  obtaining  a  signifcant  beneft  from  this  database  for  their research works and other academic tasks. Although, the  numbers  of  journals  in  social  science  disciplines  are  less  in  comparison to other disciplines in the databases, it is helping  researchers  to  enhance  their  research  work.  Above  all,  a  large  number  of  researchers  are  not  aware  of  this  database.  Therefore,  the  library  should  take  care  of  such  researchers  through organising literacy programs and orientation programs  for  new  researchers  so  that  they  become  familiar  about  the  available sources of the library and can use these resources to  its maximum potential.
