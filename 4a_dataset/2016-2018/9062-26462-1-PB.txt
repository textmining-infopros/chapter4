The paper is the outcome of a survey conducted at Dr. Y. S. Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry  (DYSPUH&F). The aim of the survey was to assess the use of electronic information resources (EIRs) by  the academic community of the university. Questionnaire method was used as a data collection tool. It was  found that users of DYSPUH&F library prefer both print and electronic format of EIRs. In case of electronic  version majority of them prefer online mode of access. The preference of users with regard to format and  mode of access does not vary signifcantly from one type of users to another. AGRIS & CABI databases and  the e-journals available through Consortium for Electronic Resources in Agriculture (CeRA) are the commonly  used EIRs. The users yet do not use e-books and e-theses at a large scale. Though used by a small  percentage of users CAB e-books and KrishiPrabha appear to be the leading e-books and e-theses collections,  respectively. With regard to use of indexing and abstracting databases, e-journal and e-theses collections  the choice among three types of users varies quite signifcantly; which however is not true for e-books.

1.  IntroDUctIon 
The  study  is  an  attempt  to  assess  the  use  of  electronic  information  resources  (EIRs)  by  the  academic community of the Dr. Y.S. Parmar University  of  Horticulture  and  Forestry  (DYSPUH&F). 
DYSPUH&F  is  a  hillside Agricultural  University  situated at Nuani, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India.  The University was established in 1985. The University  comprises  of  two  faculties  known  as  ‘College  of  Horticulture’  and  ‘College  of  Forestry’  both  located  in  the  same  campus  at  Nauni.  The  University  has  a  faculty  of  237  Scientists  out  of  which  169  are  posted  at  its  main  campus.  102  PhD  scholars  and  120 Masters degree students stood enrolled at the  main  campus  during  the  academic  year  20151. 
According to Lee & Boyle2  an electronic resource  or e-resource ‘is any cohesive publication in digital  form  that  is  being  marketed’  or  ‘any  electronic  product  that  delivers  a  collections  of  data,  be  it  text,  numerical,  graphical  or  time  based,  as  a  commercially  available  resource’  and  includes  ‘full  text databases, electronic journals, image collections,  multimedia products, collections of numerical data’.  The  International  Coalition  of  Library  Consortia3 defines  e-information  (or  electronic  information)  as  ‘A  broad  term  that  encompasses  abstracting  and  
indexing  services,  electronic  journals  and  other  full  text  materials,  the  offerings  of  information  aggregators, article delivery services, etc.’ which can  be  accessed  via  remote  networks  from  information  providers,  or  locally  mounted  by  a  consortium  or  one  of  its  member  libraries.

Tyagi4  reported that almost all Indian Pharmacopoeia  Commission  Scientists  and  Associates  were  seen  to  use  new  versions  of  e-journals  (100  %),  online  database  (100  %),  CD-ROM  database  (100  %),  subject  specific  information  websites  (89  %)  &  e-books (79 %) and other internet based resources.  The  author  also  revealed  that  some  Scientists  (30.77  %)  and  Associates  (37.50  %)  prefer  print  version of journals. Majority (100 %) of them prefer  to  take  along  printouts  instead  of  downloading  on  storage devices (48.65 %). Among the e-resources  the  abstract  level  databases  (MEDLINE  used  by  78  %),  e-journals  (PubMed  used  by  77  %)  and  e-books (76 %) prove to be highly used e-resources  in Institute of Medical Science Library of Kashmir5. While  attempting  to  estimate  the  actual  priority  among different e-resources through a single choice  question  Santhi6, et  al.,   found  that  the  majority  of  respondents prefer to use e-journals (20.4 %), followed

by e-mail (17.6 %), www (14.8 %), e-theses (14.4 %)  and  e-newspapers  (14  %).  E-books  (10  %)  and  e-magazines (8.8 %) are preferred by a comparatively  lesser  percentage  of  respondents. 
Kumar8, et  al.,   note  that  65  %  of  respondents  prefer  to  access  both  print  and  e-sources  equally,  despite  the  fact  that  70  %  of  them  agree  that  e-sources provide more comprehensive information  than print. Nikam9, et al.,   analysed  that  the  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  of  the  University  of  Mysore  use  both  print  and  electronic  sources  of  information  almost  equally,  as  the  mean  values  calculated for journals (print= 3.68 & electronic= 3.29),  books  (print=  2.76  &  electronic=  2.60)  and  theses  (print=  2.39  &  electronic=  2.03),  etc.  are  close  to  each  other.  However,  the  print  format  registers  a  slightly  better  use  than  electronic  format  in  each  case.  Ali10,  et  al.,   revealed  that  45  %  of  users  prefer  printed  journals,  31  %  of  them  prefer  online  journals,  and  24  %  wish  to  access  simultaneously  both  print  and  electronic  forms. 
The  library  patrons  are  keenly  interested  in  using  online  mode  of  e-resources  than  that  of  offline and as such the former registers more usage  than the later mode11. Raza12, et al.,  observed  that  68.8  %  of  the  respondents  prefer  to  use  journals  through online mode. Kumar13,  et al.,  also revealed  that  the  users  at  National  Science  Library  of  India  prefer  to  access  the  databases  and  journals  in  online  mode.  Archana14,  et  al.,   upon  studying  the  use of e-resources in Cochin University of Science  and  Technology  (CUSAT)  registered  a  demand  for  online  form  of  information  resources,  as  indicated  by  67  %  of  respondents. 
3.  Sco PE AnD objEct IvES 
The  survey  has  been  conducted  in  Dr.  Y.S.  Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Nauni,  Solan,  Himachal  Pradesh.  The  university  consists  of  two  colleges,  viz.,  ‘College  of  Agriculture  and  Horticulture’  and  the  ‘College  of  Forestry’.  Survey  has  been  restricted  to  ‘College  of  Agriculture  and  Horticulture’. The population under study comprises  of  Scientists  (Faculty),  PhD  scholars  and  Masters  degree students. In developing countries like India,  libraries  are  still  hybrid  in  nature.  They  need  to  procure both print and electronic formats of information  resources. Thus  a  need  is  felt  to  decide  about  the  proportion  at  which  these  two  formats  need  to  be  acquired. A  library  must  have  an  eye  on  the  range  of  preference  of  users  among  these  formats  and  the  frequency  at  which  they  tend  to  use  the  same.  Major proportion of budgeted amount in libraries is  nowadays  spent  on  procurement  of  e-resources.  The  libraries  are  supposed  to  decide  which  of  the  e-resources  they  need  to  procure,  that  is  why  it  is  very essential to know the most popular e-resources.  
To  make  appropriate  arrangements  for  meeting  out  the  immediate  requirements  of  different  types  of  users  and  enhance  their  satisfaction  level,  it  is  very important to know variation in their opinion and  choice.  The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
(a) Identify  the  preferred  format  of  information  
resources  and  mode  of  access  adopted  by  
users; 
(b) Assess  the  popularity  of  e-resources,  viz.,  
indexing and abstracting databases; e-journals;  
e-books,  and  e-theses; 
(c) Measure  the  level  of  variation  in  preference  
and  use  with  respect  to  type  of  user. 
4.  MEtHo DoLogY 
The number of scientists (Faculty), PhD scholars  and Masters degree students was worked out from  the  online  portal  of  National  Information  System  on  Agricultural  Education  Network  (NISAGENET)  and  finalised  after  personally  cross  checking  it  with  official  records  of  the  University.  The  sample  size  was  determined  with  the  help  of  Krejcie  &  Morgan  Table,  which  corresponds  to  103  for  a  total  population  of  140  subjects  under  study.  To  achieve the desired sample size a total number 140  questionnaires  in  print  form  were  administered  to  all  Scientists  (60),  PhD  scholars  (40)  and  Masters  degree students (40). Statistical Package for Social  Sciences (SPSS) has been used to analyse the data  and  derive  the  descriptive  statistics.  To  determine  the  significance  of  the  derived  facts,  the  data  was  subjected  to  a  non-parametric  statistical  test,  viz.,  Chi-Squared  (χ2). 
5.  DAtA  An ALYSIS AnD   Int ErPrEt AtIon 
To  draw  an  overall  trend  regarding  the  use  of  e-resources  and  see  if  there  is  any  variation  in  choice of the three types of users the collected data  has  been  analysed  and  interpreted  under  different  sub-headings  as  follows: 
5.1  Preferred  Format 
The respondents were asked to mark out one of  the  options  among  three  choices  about  the  format  of information they prefer to use. Data collected in  this  regard  is  presented  in  Table  1. 
It is evident from Table 1 that majority of library  users  (80.76  %)  in  DYSPUH&F  prefer  to  use  both  print  and  electronic  form  of  information  resources.  In  case  of  this  preferred  option  the  PhD  scholars  (90.00  %)  lead  other  two  types  of  users,  viz.,  Scientists  (82.50  %)  and  Masters  degree  students  (70.58  %).  It  is  however  statistically  observed  that  there is no significant variation in preference of three  types  of  users  with  regard  to  format  of  information  resources  (p>0.05).

Note:*(n) in each table indicates number of respondents and  the  figures  in  parentheses  indicate  their  percentage 5.2  Preferred  Mode  of  Access  
In order to assess the preferred mode of access  adopted to use of e-resources the users were asked  to tick mark one of the three options. The response  collected in this context is given in Table 2. Majority  of respondents (53.46) prefer both online and offline  modes of access. However, it is evident that users  have  got  more  tendency  to  prefer  ‘online  only’  mode  (40.60  %)  as  compared  to  the  ‘offline  only’  mode  (5.94  %).  In  case  of  the  preferred  mode  of  access it is the user group Masters degree students  (68.75  %)  who  lead  the  fray,  leaving  Scientists  (48.71  %)  and  PhD  scholars  (43.33  %)  at  2nd   and  3rd positions, respectively. The statistical observation,  however,  substantiates  the  fact  that  preference  of  three types of users with regard to mode of access  does  not  vary  significantly  (p>0.05).

5.3  Use  of  Indexing  & Abstracting  Databases 
Response  was  sought  about  five  indexing  &  abstracting (I&A) databases relevant to agro-biological  science  through  a  multiple  choice  question.  Data  collected  in  this  regard  is  displayed  in  Table  3. 
It is obvious from Table 3 that AGRIS (64.42 %)  and  CABI  (50.96  %)  are  the  majorly  used  I&A  databases. The other three databases are used by  only  10-20  %  of  users.  Masters  degree  students  
19 
(73.53 %) prove to be voracious users than Scientists  (67.50  %)  and  PhD  scholars  (50  %)  with  regard  to  use  of  AGRIS,  while  in  case  of  CABI  it  is  PhD  scholars  (63.33  %)  who  are  voracious  users  than  that  of  Scientists  (55.00  %)  and  Masters  degree  students  (35.29  %).  It  is  statistically  substantiated  that  there  is  a  significant  variation  in  choice  of  three  types  of  users  with  regard  to  use  of  I&A  databases  (p<0.05)

5.4  Use  of  E-journal collections 
In  order  to  judge  the  popularity  of  e-journal  collections  response  of  users  was  collected  about  six  e-journal  collections  commonly  available  in  India,  with  an  option  to  mark  out  more  than  one  collection. Data collected in this respect is displayed  in  Figure  1. 
Figure 1. Use of e-journal collections. 
It  is  quite  clear  from  Figure  1  that  Consortium  for  Electronic  Resources  in  Agriculture  (CeRA)  is  the  most  preffered  e-journal  collection,  being  used  by majority of respondents (94.23 %). It is followed  by ‘Indian Journals Dot Com (IJDC)’ (27.88 %) and  ‘J-Gate Agriculture  &  Biological  (JABS)’  (26.92  %).  PubMed  is  used  by  13.46  %  of  users.  The  users  are  least  interested  to  use  INDEST  (5.77  %)  and  UGC-Infonet  (4.81  %)  e-journal  collections.  PhD  scholars (96.67 %) take a slight lead over Scientists  (95.00  %)  and  Masters  degree  students  (91.18  %)

w.r.t.  use  of  CeRA.  So  far  as  the  use  of  IJDC  is  concerned  PhD  scholars  (33.33  %)  and  Scientists  (32.50  %)  prove  to  be  voracious  than  Masters  degree  students  (17.65  %).  In  case  of  JABS  it  is  Masters degree students (32.35 %) and PhD scholars  (30  %)  who  lead  the  Scientists  (20  %).  PubMed  is  majorly used by scientists (25 %) than PhD scholars  (6.67  %)  and  Masters  degree  students  (5.88  %).  It  is  also  statistically  verified  from  the  p-value  of  the  table  underlying  the  Figure  1  that  there  is  a  highly  significant  difference  in  use  of  different  e-journal  collections  across  three  types  of  users  (χ2=23.92;  df=10;  p<0.01). 
5.5  Use  of  E-book  collections 
Information about popularly used e-book collections  was  sought  through  a  multiple  option  question  among two e-book collections commonly available in  India. A  blank  space  was  also  provided  to  mention  any  more  e-book  collections  they  use  other  than  the  two  in  the  list.  The  response  of  users  in  this  context  is  presented  in  Table  4.  
Table 4 indicates that the e-book collections have  not  yet  become  much  popular  among  library  users  of DYSPUH&F, as only 48.07 % of them marked to  have used the CAB e-Books and only 34.61 % the  KrishiKosh. Not a single e-book collection has been  observed to be in use in the University, through the  space  provided  for  ‘any  other’  option.  So  far  as  the use of CAB eBooks is concerned PhD scholars  (56.67  %)  happens  to  be  the  leading  user  group  than Masters degree students (50 %) and Scientists  (42.50  %).  It  is  however  statistically  observe  that  there  is  no  significant  variation  among  three  types  of  users  with  respect  to  use  of  e-books  (p>0.05).

*users were allowed to opt for more than one option 5.6  Use  of  E-thesis collections 
Names of four open access e-theses collections  and one International e-theses directory was placed  before  the  respondents  to  judge  their  popularity  among library users of DYSPUH&F. An overall view  of the user response in this connection is displayed  as  Figure  2. 
It  is  evident  from  Figure  2  that  the  users  of  DYSPUH&F  appear  to  be  less  familiar  about  all  the  five  open  access  e-theses  collections,  as  only  34.07  %  of  them  are  observed  to  use  the  Indian  
Doctoral  Dissertations  Database  ‘KrishiPrabha’,  followed by the Indian National Agricultural Information  Repository  ‘KrishiKosh’  (23.70  %).  However,  some  users  are  observed  to  use  the  non-agriculture- specific e-theses collections ‘ShodGanga (19.26 %)’  and the ‘Yahoo Directory’ (18.52 %). ‘Vidyanidhi’ is  noted  to  be  used  by  least  number  of  respondents  (1.48 %). The statistical observation derived for the  underlying table of Figure 2 substantiates that there  is  not  a  significant  difference  in  use  of  different  e-theses  collections  across  three  types  of  users  (χ2=6.50;  df=8;  p>0.05). 
Figure 2. Use of e-theses collections. 6.  FInDIngS AnD   D IScUSSIon 
Majority of Scientists, PhD sholars and Masters  degree students of DYSPUH&F (80.76) still prefer to  use both print and electronic information resources  and  the  majority  of  respondents  (94.06  %)  prefers  to  access  and  use  them  through  online  mode.  The  preference  of  users  resembles  to  a  great  extent  to  the  preference  of  users  of  other  parts  of  the  country  as  explored  by  research  studies  like  that  of  Tyagi4,  Bhat5,  et  al.,   &  Santhi 
6,  
et  al. The  finding  that  users  prefer  to  use  e-resources  through online mode of access is supported by the  findings of Swain11, et al.,  Raza 
12, et al. 
,  (68.8  %),  Kumar13,   et.  al.  and Archana14, et  al.,   (67  %).  
AGRIS  (64.42  %)  and  CABI  (50.96  %)  appear  to be the majorly used indexing & abstracting (I&A)  databases. This finding, however, goes contrary to  the findings of Tyagi4, & Bhat5 et al.,  who recorded a  heavy usage of I&A databases. The lower percentage  of  users  (50  %  to  65  %)  using  these  databases  makes  us  to  presume  that  the  users  are  either  not  aware  about  their  existence  in  the  library  or  satisfy  their  need  by  searching  the  abstracts  from  Internet.  
CeRA  proves  to  be  the  number  one  full  text  e-journal collection as it is used by majority (94.23 %)  of users. Tyagi4  (100 %), and Bhat 
5,  et al., 
 (78 %)  in  their  respective  studies  also  registered  a  heavy  usage  of  e-journals;  while  Santhi6,  et  al.,   found  that  only  20.4  %  of  respondents  use  e-journals. A  couple  of  research  studies  even  reveal  that  it  is  print  format  of  e-journals  which  is  preferred  over  that  of  electronic  format  (Kumar8,  et  al.,  Nikam9,  et  al.,   and Ali 
10,  
et  al.,).

DJLIT,  VOL.  36,  NO.  1,  JANUARY   2016 
The  e-book  collections  have  not  yet  become  popular among library users of DYSPUH&F, as only  48.07  %  of  them  marked  to  have  used  the  CAB  e-Books and only 34.61 % the KrishiKosh. The users  appear to be less familiar about the freely available  full text e-theses collections, as only ‘KrishiPrabha’ is  observed to be used by a considerable percentage  of users (34.61 %). Nikam9, et. al.,  also found that  almost  similar  proportions  of  respondents  (52  %).  However, users of some academic institutions of the  country,  as  reported  by  Tyagi4   (79  %)  and  Bhat 
5,  et  al.,   (76  %)  are  observed  to  use  e-books  to  a  considerably  high  magnitude. 
The overall analysis shows that the I&A databases  and e-journals emerge out as the most widely used  e-resources,  whereas  the  e-books  and  e-theses  are  not  yet  used  to  a  desirable  magnitude.  These  findings  resemble  to  the  outcome  of  a  number  of  research studies reviewed in this paper, while also  go  contrary  to  some  findings  noted  there  upon. 
The  preference  of  users  with  regard  to  format  and mode of access does not vary significantly from  one type of user to another (p>0.05). However, it is  statistically substantiated that there is a significant  variation  in  choice  of  three  types  of  users  with  regard to use of I&A databases (p<0.05), e-journals  and e-theses collections (p<0.01). But at the same  time, no statistically significant variation is observed  among  three  types  of  users  with  respect  to  use  of  e-books  (p>0.05). 
7.  concLUSI onS AnD SUggEStIonS 
The  users  of  DYSPUH&F  prefer  to  use  both  print and electronic sources of information. In case  of  e-resources  the  ‘online’  is  the  most  preferred  mode  of  access.  Majority  of  the  users  are  seen  to  use  I&A  databases,  viz.,  ‘AGRIS  (64.42  %)’  &  ‘CABI (50.96 %)’ and the e-journal collection ‘CeRA  (94.23  %)’.  E-books  and  e-theses  are  not  being  yet  used  to  a  desired  magnitude. The  choice  of    3  types  of  users  varies  significantly  w.r.t.  to  use  and  preference  of  e-resources,  while  it  does  not  vary  in  some  cases. 
The  DYSPUH&F  library  should  still  adhere  to  a  balanced  collection  development  policy  while  procuring  two  formats  of  information  resources  in  almost in equal proportion. The library should procure   reputed e-book and e-thesis collections and launch  an  awareness  campaign  to  promote  their  use. The  library  must  ensure  a  smooth  and  reliable  online  access  to  its  e-resource  base.
