1.  INtrODUctION 
Marketing means working with markets to actualize  potential exchanges for the purpose of satisfying human  needs and wants. It is the process of planning and executing  the  conception,  pricing,  promotion,  and  distribution  of  goods,  services,  and  ideas  to  create  exchanges  with  target  groups  that  satisfy  customer  and  organisational  objectives1. 
‘Marketing’ is often misused and confused with selling,  which  is  part  of  the  marketing  technique.  Selling  only  focuses  on  the  needs  of  the  seller  while  marketing  on  the  needs  of  the  buyer.  Selling  is  preoccupied  with  the  seller′s need to convert the product into cash; marketing,  with the idea of satisfying the needs of the customer by  means  of  the  product  and  the  whole  cluster  of  things  associated with creating, delivering, and finally consuming  it2.  Marketing  is  both  a  concept  dedicated  to  meeting  customer requirements and a range of techniques which  enables the company to determine those requirements and  ensure they are met. The American Marketing Association  defines marketing as “The process of planning and executing  the  conception,  pricing,  promotion,  and  distribution  of  ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy  individual and organization goal3.” Marketing is a social  and managerial process by which individuals and groups  obtain  what  they  need  and  want  through  creating  and  exchanging  products  and  value  with  others4. 
1.1  Marketing  by  Libraries 
The  library  has  many  products  and  services  that  it  can  market.  Each  library  needs  to  identify  what  it  
wishes  to  market  and  how.  Marketing  is  not  just  about  developing  and  promoting  new  services  and  products  but  also  about  bringing  awareness  to  clients  of  existing  services and products and determining their appropriateness.  Marketing plan needs to be developed and implemented  with  ongoing  enhancement  of  the  services  and  products  should  follow5. 
Product—A product is something, which a customer buys  so  as  to  lead  the  life  or  to  solve  the  problems  coming  in day-to-day life. A product must be customer-oriented,  capable  of  providing  all  the  necessary  benefits  desired  or  expected  by  the  customer.    
Services—A  service  is  any  act  or  performance  that  one  party  can  offer  to  another  that  is  essentially  intangible  and  doesn’t  result  in  the  ownership  of  anything.  People—Experts,  specialists,  consultants,  cataloguer,  assifier,  bibliographer,  translator,  abstractor,  indexer. Places—Libraries  and  its  different  departments. 
Some LIS services are: (i) Current Awareness Service  (CAS)—Traditional  and  Computerised;  (ii)  Selective  Dissemination of Information (SDI)—Manual and Computerised;  (iii)  Reference  Service;  (iv)  Translation  Service;  (v)  Document  Delivery  Service;  (vi)  Reprographic  Service;  (vii)  Indexing  and  Abstracting  Service;  (viii)  Referral  Service; (ix) Information Consolidation & Repackaging;  and  (x)  Online  Search  Service,  etc. 
Some LIS Products are:  (i)  Compilation  of  Indexes  and Abstracts; (ii) Profiles of Specialists; (iii) Compilation  of  Need  Based  Bibliographies;  (iv)  Current  Content

2. LItErAtUrE  rEVIEW 
Numerous literature have been published on marketing  aspect  in  libraries  all  over  the  world  but  still  the  field  has not yet evolved to be a robust field in librarianship.  Some of the conceptual studies, surveys, etc., heve been  conducted  by  scholars. Amritpal  Kaur  &  Rani6   in  their  article  have  assessed  the  attitude  of  the  users  towards  the  marketing  of  information  services  and  products  of  university libraries. Dhawan7  in his case study has identified  that the marketing of scientific and technical information  by  special  libraries  using  internal  resources  has  been  examined in the context of marketing programmes at the  NPL Library. Gupta & Jambhekar8  in their  article point  out  that  philosophically,  users  are  the  central  entity  in  all types of the libraries and the library need marketing  to reach to the patrons. Haravu9   in  his  article  discusses  the concept of marketing, relevance of marketing concept  for  libraries  and  further,  provided  some  thoughts  on  marketing  of  library  and  information  services  in  India.  Jestin and Parameswari10  in their paper has discusses about  information management and marketing and pointed out  different marketing activities, techniques and strategies.  They  have  also  discussed  how  to  create  a  market  and  professional skills required for marketing. Kottai11  in his  study focuses on promoting technical information products  and services. Presents marketing tips and techniques and  lists various promotional activities. Nikam12  in his paper  intends  to  present  the  significance  of  promoting  library  use in the knowledge era. Ramanna and Ranganath13   in  their article discuss the concept of marketing in NICFOS  services,  which  are  marketed  by  NICFOS  and  discuss  about  the  marketing  trends  and  prospects.  Rowley14 examines  some  of  the  key  concepts  concerned  with  customers  and  consumer  buyer  behavior.  It  starts  by  seeking  to  explore  the  concept  of  customer  for  library  and  information  services  and  notes  the  role  of  users,  influencers  and  deciders.  Many  library  and  information  services deal with internal customers. In order to offer an  effective service to customers, it is important to identify  the benefits sought by different groups or segments and  to  understand  the  consumer  decision-making  process  which  is  important  in  determining  purchase  in  behavior  and  the  use  of  the  services. 
3. ObJEctIVES 
The  present  study  covers  the  marketing  aspects  in  Institute  of  Economic  Growth  (IEG),  National  Council  of  Applied  Economic  Research  (NCAER),  Ratan  Tata  Library  (RTL),  and  National  Institute  of  Public  Finance  and  Policy  (NIPFP). 
The  main  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: (a)  Examine  awareness  among  users  about  the  product  
and  services  of  libraries  under  study; 
132 
(b)  Explore users’ willingness to pay for the information  
products  and  services  and  to  know  the  satisfaction  
level  of  users  with  the  collection,  services  and  
products  provided  by  the  library;

marketing  and  its  use. 
5. MEthODOLOgy  AND ANALySIS 
After scanning carefully the existing literature available  in  the  area  of  study,  two  well-structured  questionnaires  for  users'  and  librarians  were  designed  and  distributed  personally. It was observed that most of the respondents  responded  all  the  questions  in  questionnaire.  Overall  it  may be remarked that the response to the questionnaires  was  very  good.  The  responses  received  from  both  the  questionnaires  were  helpful  in  drawing  conclusion. 
The data collected through questionnaire administered  to the librarians in the four libraries have been analysed  and  presented  in  a  comparative  manner  with  a  view  to  identify  the  marketing  of  LIS  products  and  Services. 
5.1  Library  Finance 
Table  1  shows  that  the  sources  of  finance  of  four  libraries  and  it  can  be  seen  that  all  the  four  libraries  receive special grant and IEG and NCAER libraries don’t  have  any  other  source  of  finance.  RTL  gets  its  finance  from three heads that is UGC-Grants, Special Grant and  library  fee,  whereas  NIPFP  library  finance  comprise  only  special  grant  and  library  fines.  No  library  under  study  has  its  sources  of  finance  through  marketing  of  products and services and, separate funds for marketing  activities

All  the  libraries  allocate  less  than  1%  of  total  budget  for  marketing  activities  and  furthermore,  in  all  the four libraries the decision of spending the money on  marketing  or  any  other  activity  is  taken  by  the  library  committee. 
5.3    Need  of  Marketing 
When  the  librarians  were  asked  about  the  need  of  marketing of LIS products and services all were in favor  of marketing except NIPFP library, according to NIPFP  the  need  of  marketing  is  apparent  to  society.  Except

NIPFP  all  are  agree  that  by  marketing  users  will  be  aware  about  the  products  and  services  of  the  library,  it  will  help  to  compete  for  customers;  will  be  very  useful  for  balancing  shrinking  budget.  
5.4   t ools  and techniques  used  for  Promotion  of  
LIS  Products  and  Services 
Table 2 shows that all the four libraries are promoting  their products and services. Both methods of promotion,  i.e.,  traditional  and  internet  are  adopted.  All  the  four  libraries  are  promoting  through  orientation  programme,  display of latest arrivals, face to face communication and  through website. Annual report is used as promotional tool  by RTL, IEG and NIPFP. Only IEG and NIPFP libraries  distribute  pamphlets/brouchers  for  the  promotion.  RTL  and  NIPFP  use  e-mail  to  inform  users  about  the  new  services  and  products  of  the  library.

(a) All the libraries are getting special grant as a source  
of finance. NIPFP library also receive finance through  
library  fine,  and  RTL  receives  library  fee  as  well  
as  UGC  grant.  Further,  there  is  no  library  having  
separate  funds  for  marketing-related  activities.  (b) Although each library realises the need of marketing

except NIPFP library and designates its less than1%  
of  total  library  budget  for  marketing  activities.  
Library  committee  decides  the  amount  to  be  spent  
on  marketing  activities. 
(c) Librarians  opined  that  marketing  helps  in  creating  
awareness  of  the  products  and  services  to  users  
and  to  convey  the  message  about  new  services  and  
products  of  the  library. The  NIPFP  library  assumes  
that importance of the library is apparent to society  
though  there  is  no  need  of  marketing. 
(d) Each  library  conducts  user  survey  before  starting  
new  service  or  product  but  doesn’t  have  plan  for  
marketing.  It  is  found  that  libraries  don’t  have  
separate  marketing  section  to  perform  marketing  
activities. In fact, no library has its own library logo  
to  brand  itself.  It  shows  that  there  is  no  branding  
attitude  in  the  libraries. 
(e) NCAER  library  and  RTL  has  their  own  mission  
statement for the library while NIPFP and IEG don’t  
have  their  mission  statement.  Libraries  promote  
their  products  and  services  using  both  internet  and  
traditional  methods. 
(f) Libraries do ’t distribute pamphlets/posters/brouchers,  
etc., for the promotion of their products and services.  
Most  of  the  libraries  are  using  annual  report,  user  
orientation programme and display of latest arrivals.  
Most of the libraries are using website for the promotion  
of  the  products  and  services  of  the  library. (g) Each library allows non-members to use the library.  
They  allow  only  after  producing  the  guide’s  or  
supervisor’s  recommendation  letter.  Further,  only  
the  RTL  charges  the  non-members  differently  from  
the  in-house  user  and  other  libraries  treat  them  as  
their  own  user. 
(h) Most of the services provided by these libraries are  
free  of  cost  except  photocopying  service  which  is  
charged  a  nominal  cost  by  the  user. 
8.   c ONcLUSIONS 
This  study  has  compared  the  customer  satisfaction  of libraries against libraries level of market orientation.  The  marketing  of  the  library  products  and  services  is  an  important  determinant  of  its  performance  and  users’  satisfaction. Regular assessment of customers’ information  needs and demands is a vital instrument for expansion of  library services and product. It is important for libraries  to act in a marketing attitude by understanding what the  customers need and deliver the value to their information  needs and expectations. Thus, it would be beneficial for  the  librarians  to  implicate  the  findings  of  the  study  for  improving their performance to provide higher customer  satisfaction. In brief, the overall findings of this research  suggest that marketing is an important tool for identifying  differences  between  library  and  its  users.  It  will  help  library  to  increase  the  use  of  its  services  and  lead  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  users.
