AbStrACt 
The purpose of this research is to examine the perceived importance and perceived experiences of library service  quality for hospitality management students. Also, an effort was made to identify the strengths and weaknesses  of library service quality based on their perception of library services. The researchers have used LibQUAL+®, a  popular tool that libraries use to assess the perception of library service quality over the years. Undergraduates and  postgraduate’s students studying in one of the premier private hotel management institutes in India participated in  this study. The fndings of the study suggest that library service providers need to understand the needs of students  and should have the inclination to help students in making the library a gateway for study, learning and research.  The future research may include faculty members’ perception of importance and performance of library service  quality. This type of survey can be repeated at regular intervals to distinguish the varying needs of library users.

Analysis 
1.  IntroduCtIon 
The Ministry of Tourism established the National Council  for Hotel Management and Catering Technology (NCHMCT)  in  the  year  1982  to  impart  hospitality  education  in  India1. Quality  is  one  of  the  important  subjects  discussed  among  education institutions and is being studied extensively. Among  other  service  providing  departments,  college  library  plays  an  important  role  in  catering  to  their  customer’s  academic  needs.  The  collection  assessment  was  the  primary  focus  of  traditional  library  service  quality  surveys.  However,  for  the  last  ten  years,  academic  library  service  providers  have  progressively documented the implications of evaluating their  library  services.2-13.  Nevertheless,  measuring  library  quality  based solely on collections of learning resources is obsolete14.  Thus, the conventional evaluation of library quality has moved  from collection assessment to other supporting services such  as;  assessment  of  information  and  learning  services,  digital  content, availability and accessibility of learning resources, and  library and information technology services15 (Characteristics  of  Excellence,  2006). This  change  in  assessment  is  the  lead  for the transformation of academic libraries from a collection- centric view to a customer-centric view.  
According to16  Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Berry (1990),  only the customers can judge the quality of services and all  other judgments are fundamentally unrelated. Therefore, it is  essential for the library administrator to assess the quality of  services through customer surveys. LibQUAL+® is one such  survey, which is wildly used by college and university libraries.

It is one of assessment tools used by the academic libraries to  measure the library service quality. One of the advantages of  this survey instrument is ease of administration. In addition,  the LibQUAL+® test scale has been proved to be a reliable  and  valid  survey  instrument17-21.   However,  some  researchers  fnd  that  LibQUAL+®  respondents  do  not  fully  understand  the  three  service  levels  minimum  desired,  and  perceived  asked  in  the  survey22.Researchers  also  found  the  gap  scores  calculated  on  these  service  level  scores  were  not  constant  since  respondents’  expectations  change  with  experience23. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt additional matrix for a  pinpoint evaluation of library service quality. Thus, this study  additionally adopts Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) to  evaluate the services provided by the library.  
IPA proposed by24 is one such matrix widely used for the  evaluation of service and product. IPA identifes satisfaction as  the function of two components: the importance of a product  or service to a customer and the performance of the products or  service. The combined rating of these two components provides  an overall view of satisfaction with clear instructions for the  decision  makers  where  to  focus  for  further  improvements.  IPA  is  widely  used  in  service  industries  such  as  travel  and  tourism25-28;  Higher  education29-32;  E-Government  services33;  and other sectors34,35. Thus, this tool can effectively be used  for measuring the importance-performance attributes of library  services for the further enhancement of library service quality36.  Even  though  there  are  numerous  research  fndings  available  in the literature on adoption of IPA in higher education, there  are no research studies which focused its application to library  service quality particularly using LibQUAL+®.

1.1   o bjectives 
The present study investigates the importance-performance  of  service  quality  attributes  of  hotel  management  library,  as  perceived  by  undergraduate  and  postgraduate  students  of  a  private university using LibQUAL+®. The primary objective  is to evaluate the quality of library services to identify the key  areas of improvement to enhance overall user satisfaction.

2.1  Library  Service  Quality  
LibQUAL+®,  the  extension  of  SERVQUAL37   was  developed  by Association  of  Research  Libraries38   (ARL)  in  collaboration with Texas A & M University in 1999 with the  objectives to assess and measure library service quality. This  measurement  tool  is  a  thoroughly  tested  and  validated  web- based  survey  tool;  to  assess,  measure,  and  improve  library  services, change organizational culture, and market the library.  It  permits  library  service  providers  to  perform  systematic  assessment and measure of library service quality. Furthermore,  this tool is used and tested in variety of libraries, including,  academic 39,40; agricultural41; health42; college43; university44,45 and  public  libraries46.  LibQUAL+®  helps  libraries  to  assess  the  services  provided  by  them  and  to  develop  the  library  services to meet the customers’ expectations38. The survey data  helps  library  service  providers  in  identifying  best  practices,  analyze  shortfall,  and  effectively  reallocate  resources  based  on  customers’  perception.  Library  service  providers  have  successfully  used  LibQUAL+®  survey  data  to  identify  best  practices,  study  discrepancies,  and  effectively  assign  human  resources23,47-50.  Furthermore,  the  combination  of  gap  model  and IPA has been used by the researchers in recent years in  a different area of study51-55. Thus, it can be assumed that an  integrated approach of combining gap model and IPA works  very well frst to evaluate service quality and then to classify  service items into different category in terms of importance- performance56. 
The  purpose  of  using  IPA  in  this  study  was  to  identify  important  attributes  of  library  service  in  terms  of  four  quadrants  of  IPA:1.  Concentrate  here,  2.  Keep  up  the  good  work,  3.  Possible  overkill,  and  4.  Low  priority,  so  that  the  library administrators can gain insights to improve the service  quality of library. 
2.2  Importance-performance Analysis 
The importance-performance analysis  ( IPA) is a popular  tool used as a research framework by many researchers for the  measurement of service quality57-60. This IPA model is divided  into  four  quadrants  (Fig.  1)  with  performance  on  the  x-axis  and importance on the y-axis resulting in, four quadrants viz.  Concentrate Here, Keep up the Good Work, Low Priority, and  Possible Overkill. The quadrants are as follows: 
Quadrant  I  (High  Importance/  Low  Performance)  is  labeled  ‘Concentrate  Here’.  The  variables  fall  into  this  quadrant  need  more  attention  and  library  service  providers  need  to  consider  this  as  a  top  priority.  Quadrant  II  (High  Importance/ High Performance) is labeled “Keep up the good  work.” The variables fall into this quadrant are the strength of  the library services. Library service providers can continue to  
126 
do good work on these areas of the library. Quadrant III (Low  Importance/ Low Performance) is labeled ‘Low Priority’. Thus,  any of the variables which fall in this quadrant are not important  and  doesn’t  need  more  attention,  and  possible  variables  for  cost  cutting  strategies.  Quadrant  IV  (Low  Importance/  High  Performance) is labeled ‘Possible Overkill’. Variables fall into  this quadrant are overly emphasised by the library, and therefore  libraries should deploy their focus more on quadrant I and II. 
This matrix is successfully used in measuring the different  dimensions of education. For example, students psychological  and  social  adoptions61,  to  explore  attractiveness  of  higher  education,  for  evaluation  educational  process62,  choice  of  college63,  IT  governance  strategies  in  university64,  quality  assurance in higher education65, and course evaluation66. The  survey conducted by association of higher education facilities  offces  reveals  that  services  like  labs,  classroom  buildings,  libraries are becoming increasingly important as a factor for  college choice67. Students expressed library services as one of  the important facilities for decision making for the choice of  college.  Thus, this matrix can be used along with LibQUAL  model  to  evaluate  the  library  service  quality  for  further  improvement by the library service providers.

This  study  used  LibQUAL®,  as  a  survey  instrument  to  gather data from the undergraduate and postgraduate students  of  a  hospitality  management  college.It  was  a  census  study  covering the entire population.  As the population was small  enough,  the  researcher  decided  use  the  entire  population  to  ensure that everybody who mattered represented. Considering  the level of maturity and intellectual understanding, only the  ‘senior’  students  of  both  undergraduate  and  postgraduate  hospitality  programs  were  made  to  participate  in  the  study.  The sample consisted of 124 senior students of fnal year of  Bachelor of Hotel Management and second year of Master’s  in Hospitality studies.  The students were asked to rate both  importance-performance  of  all  variables  on  a  7-point  Likert  scale  where;  1  is  being  low,  and  7  is  being  high.  The  total  number of a questionnaire distributed were 124, out of which  95 questionnaires were usable resulting in the response rate of  91%. Hence, a total of 95 questionnaires were considered for  further analysis.

i.  Willingness to help users  
ii.  Knowledge to answer user questions,  
iii.  Readiness to respond to users’ questions,  
iv.  Handling users’ service problems, and  
v.  Understand the needs of their users.  
Two  important  variables  regarding  information  control  are:  
(a)  Making information easily available for independent use  
and 
(b)  Library website to locate information on my own.  
The  variables:  electronic  information  resources,  easy- to-use  tools  and  print/electronic  journals  are  rated  equally  important. The print media and modern equipment are rated as  least important. In the third attribute, i.e., library as a place, the  variables that are rated as most important are:  
i.  Library as a gateway  
ii. Quiet space for individual activities  
iii.  A comfortable and inviting location  
iv.  Community space for group learning and fnally v.  Library space that inspires study and learning. 
The  mean  and  standard  deviation  for  aggregated  data  is  calculated  to  understand  the  students’  perception  of  importance-performance  of  library  services  (Table  1).  This  Table 1 illustrates, the attribute that students perceive as most  important are Affect of service (M =5.75, SD=1.86) followed  by  information  control  (M  =5.73,  SD=1.78)  and  library  as  place (M =5.66, SD=1.51). The attribute that students perceive  as well performed is Information control (M=5.53, SD=1.55)  followed by Affect of service (M=5.48, SD=1.16) and library  as a place (M=5.4, SD=159).  
4.3  Importance-Performance Analysis  
Quadrant  I:   Concentrate  Here  (High  Importance/  Low  Performance), which is a key area that needs to be improved  based on students rating are:   
(a)  Library  as  a  gateway  for  study,  and  learning/  research  
(LP4) 
(b)  Willingness to help users (AOS8) 
(c)  Understand the needs of users (AOS7). 
Quadrant II:  Keep the good work (High Importance/ High  Performance), all variables which fall in this quadrant are the  strength and pride of the library service. These are:  (a) Readiness to respond to users’ questions (AOS4) (b)  Knowledge to answer user questions (AOS5) 
(c)  Handling users ‘service problem (AOS9) 
(d)  Library website to locate information on my own (IC2) (e) Making information easily accessible for independent use  
(IC7) 
(f) Quiet space for individual activities (LP2). 
Quadrant  III:     Low  Priority  (Low  Importance/  Low  Performance),  the  variables  fall  in  this  quadrant  are  not  important and carry no threat to the library. These are:  (a)  Instill confdence in users (AOS1) 
(b)  Giving users individual attention (AOS2) 
(c)  Consistently courteous (AOS3) 
(d)  The printed library materials I need for my work (IC3) (e)  The electronic information resources I need (IC4)  (f)  Library space that inspires study and learning (LP1).

Quadrant  IV:  Possible  Overkill  (Low  Importance/ High Performance), the library gives more importance to the  variables that are falling in this quadrant which are perceived  as less important by the students. These are:  
(a)  Deal with users in a caring fashion (AOS6) 
(b) Modern  equipment  that  lets  me  easily  access  needed  
information (IC5) 
(c)  Community space for group learning (LP5). 
5.   dISC uSSIonS 
From  the  perspective  of  hospitality  students  as  end  users of library services, the main focus areas of importance  and  performance  that  leads  to  satisfaction  are  identifed. As  predicted, this helps in the strategic identifcation of importance- performance of library services based on the user’s needs and  wants. The three factors considered for the evaluations are:  i.  Affect of services 
ii.  Information control 
iii.  Library as a place.  
The fndings of this study reveal that aspect of the services  is  rated  as  most  important  by  hospitality  students  followed  by  information  control  and  library  as  a  place.  The  detailed  importance  -performance  rating  of  LibQUAL+®  variables  reveal that willingness to help users is most important aspect  of services for hospitality students. Also, this variable fall in  the Quadrant I: Concentrate Here, which suggests that library  staff need to concentrate on this area of service quality. This  is  in  line  with  the  study  conducted  by44,68,  which  suggests  that  willingness  to  help  users  is  one  of  the  services  highly  expected from the users in library. Another variable which fall  in quadrant I that needs more attention is understand the needs  of user. Clearly, this is another service highly expected from  the users as per the study68. It is very important for the library  service providers to understand needs of its users to provide  specifc  information  sought  by  the  users.  The  third  variable  which fall in quadrant I is library as a gateway for study/ learn.  The students consider library as a place to study, learn and carry  their research. This is an important area where library service  providers  can  focus  their  resource  for  further  improvement.

Library staff are encouraged for more involvement in students  learning  activities  by  providing  individual  attention  to  the  students.  
6.  ConCLuSIonS 
IPA  is  a  simple  and  useful  technique  that  helps  library  service  providers  to  identify  the  strength  as  well  as  key  areas  needed  to  be  improved  to  increase  overall  customer  satisfaction. From the research perspective, this study supports  the adoption of the IPA as a research framework for evaluating  students’  perception  of  importance-performance  of  library  service quality. Though students identifed many variables as  the strength of the library service, the library service providers  or  staff  need  to  focus  on  the Affect  like  willingness  to  help  users and understand the needs of users. Also, it is necessary  to understand that library plays an important role as a gateway  for  study,  learning,  and  research.  Library  staff  need  to  be  motivated towards this. However, a generalization of this study  need not be overstated. The future research should include a  large sample drawn from students and faculty members for an  understanding of importance-performance of library services.   A similar evaluation method can be applied in future research  to  compare  the  importance  levels  attached  to  identify  the  relative satisfaction levels of end users.
