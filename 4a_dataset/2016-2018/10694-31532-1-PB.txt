ABSTRACT 
The purpose of this study was to examine the factors infuencing the usage of the internet by the university  students for academic purposes. This study adopted Technology acceptance model (TAM) as a research framework.  The study tests the research framework using structural equation modeling. Three hundred and seventy-eight students  from a private Universites in India participated in this study. The fndings of this study suggest that the attitude  and perceived usefulness of theInternet signifcantly infuence the behavioral intention of the students on using the  internet for the academic purposes. The study revealed that the perceived usefulness of the Internet is signifcantly  infuenced bythe perceived ease of using the Internet. Findings also demonstrate satisfactory model ft between the  model and observed data. The results of this study will be useful for the university authority to enhance the internet  sources and services within the campus for its effective and effcient use for academic purposes by the students.

1.  InTRodUCTIon 
The Internet has shaped and changed the way people  live,  both  at  the  personal  and  expert  levels,  in  the  last  few decades.  As a result,the use of internet has expanded  itself into education. The Internet has influenced the way  people learn, especially in higher educational institutes.  This  provides  ready  accessibility  to  data.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  for  academicians  to  stay  well-informed  with  the  current  developments  so  that  they  do  not  lag  behind  in  creating  competitive  advantage.  As  per  the  report  published  by  Internet  and  Mobile Association  of  India1,  (32%)  of  the  users  are  college  students. Among  the  female  Internet  users,  the  highest  growth  has  been  among  the  non-working  women  followed  by  school  going  girls  (36%)  and  college  going  girls  (26%).  It  is  increasing  significantly  because  of  its  easy  and  quick  accessibility  to  information.  Besides  social  connection  and  entertainment,  the  internet  provides  academic  and  scientific information also. Internet use has the potential  to enhance the quality of education2. According to Dryli &  Kinnaman as cited by Muniandy3  internet permits students  to  find  information  from  as  well  as  it  allows  users  to  think  analytically  and  ingeniously  to  use  co-operative,  collective  endeavors  to  solve  problems.  The  Internet  is  an  integral  part  of  student’s  academic  life,  and  it  is  essential  to  understand  the  factors  which  influence  their  behavioral  intention  in  using  the  internet  in  an  educational set up. The focus of this study is to examine  the  factors  affecting  the  actual  usage  of  internet  by  university  students  for  their  academic  purpose.  For  this  purpose, Technology Acceptance Model hereafter called  
Received 22 November 2016, online published 24 March 2017 
as  TAM4,  is  adopted  as  a  research  framework.  TAM  is  one of the renowned models associated with technology  acceptance.  It  studies  the  acceptance  of  technology  by  an individual considering both perceived ease of use and  usefulness  of  the  technology.  TAM  suggests  that  when  users  are  provided  with  new  technology,  many  factors  define their decision to use that technology. This model  aims  at  investigating  how  individual  perceptions  affect  intentions  to  use  information  technology  as  well  as  its  actual  usage. 
Review  of  literature  on  internet  usage  shows  that  there  is  a  dearth  of  research  on  the  academic  usage  of  internet by university students based on TAM though there  exist enough studies on internet usage per se2-3,5-17. Earlier  research studies conducted in the area of internet usage for  academic purposes focused on the usage of digital library  resources, e-resources among the faculties, students and  the research scholars. In this study, the researchers have  made an attempt to use TAM and study the how students  generally  use  the  internet  resources  for  enhancing  their  academic skills. Students belonging to different discipline  like  medicine,  engineering,  management,  hospitality,  paramedical,  dental  commerce,  and  management  were  included  as  part  of  this  study. The  sample  comprises  of  students from various constituent institutes and colleges  of  the  university.

The  Internet  is  perceived  as  one  of  the  factors  that  determine students' success in academic life. Prior research  on  internet  usage  shows  that  a  significant  number  of

respondents of representative studies use the internet for  a  variety  of  reasons  such  as  knowledge  enhancement,  education  related  information,  solving  their  queries,  and improving their academic performance13.  The  study  conducted  in  a  Malaysian  Public  University  by  Siraj17  infers that students use the internet for more than 6 hours  
to use the technology26. TAM suggests that two particular  views, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are  of prime importance that controls technology acceptance  behavior.

85.71% study subjects stated that Google is the favorite  search  engine  for  retrieving  the  information.  Research  conducted by Aggarwal18   showed  that  78.57%  using  the  internet  daily,  76.79%  of  respondents’  access  materials  that  are  related  to  academics.  Google  is  found  to  be  the  universal  search  engine.The  survey,  conducted  by  Limaye & Fotwengel8   showed  that  a  significant  number  
‘easy  to  use,’  they  perceive  the  technology  as  ‘useful'.   TAM  proposes  relationships  of  these  central  constructs  with  other  three  constructs  namely  ‘attitude  towards  the  technology'  (ATT),  ‘behavioral  intention  to  use  the  technology (BIT)' and ‘actual use of technology (AU).’  ATT  is  defined  as  ‘an  individual's  positive  or  negative  feeling about the performing the target behavior'27.

University Digital Library identified that the  usage  of  internet  resources  is  more  among  the  students  from  science  branches,  and  the  usage  is  less  among  the  students  belonging  to  humanities  and  social  science  branches. Baikady & Mudhol22   in  their  study  found  that  the  faculty  and  students  prefer  web-based  resources  to  traditional  library.  Loan23   through  his  study  identified  that  urban  students  use  internet  for  information  seeking  and  rural  students  use  it  for  acquiring  knowledge.  Bhat  &  Mudhol24   observed  that  both  faculty  members  and  students  have  a  positive  attitude  towards  the  usage  of  e-resources  for  their  studies  and  research. 
The literature review revealed that there is a dearth of  studies especially focussing on the students behaviour of  internet usage for enhancing their academic capabilities using  TAM model, in a University consisting of students from  diverse  disciplines.  Hence  the  need  for  the  study.

This study is quantitatively focused on to examining  the usage of internet by university students for the academic  purposes  using  TAM.  The  sample  includes  students  undergoing both undergraduate and postgraduate studies in  a private university in India. The study sample comprises  students from technical, management and health sciences  discipline. After obtaining the administrative permission  from the Heads of Institutions, the survey instrument was  distributed  to  the  students  in  classrooms  and  libraries.   The total number of questionnaires distributed were 425,  out  of  which  researchers  received  393  resulting  93%  of  response rate. 15 questionnaires were not usable because  of  incomplete  data. 
4.1  Survey  Instrument 
The  survey  instrument  consists  of  two  distinct  
with each other at the level 0.01. The correlation among  the  latent  constructs  ranged  from  0.52  to  0.77  at  the  0.01  level  (Table  2).  The  model  fit  was  also  evaluated  on the basis of multiple indices. The ratio of chi-square  to  degrees  of  freedom  (χ2/df)  was  2.434.  The  ratio  of  Chi-square  was  well  within  the  recommended  threshold  value  of  5  as  recommended34.  The  Comparative  Fit  Index  (CFI),  Incremental  Fit  Index  (IFI),  Tucker-Lewis  index (TLI) was greater than 0.9 (CFI=0.918, IFI=0.919,  TLI=0.909)  as  recommended  by  Bentler  and  Bonett35.  The root mean square error of approximation (rMSEA)  was 0.062, which was less than the suggested threshold  level of 0.08 as suggested by Browne & Cudeck36. These  results  offer  evidence  that  the  data  collected  supports  the  model.  The  SRMR  was  0.048  which  was  lower  than  the  suggested  value  of  0.0537,38.  The  measurement  model was further tested for assessing construct validity,

The  items  were  rephrased  to  make  relevant  to  the  context  of  this  study. All  the  five  construct  were  measured using a 5 point Likert scale. PU and Au were  measured  from  1  being  ‘least  useful’  to  5  being  ‘highly  useful.’  PEOU  was  measured  from  1  being  ‘very  ease’  and  5  being  ‘very  difficult.’ ATI  and  BI  were  measured  from  1  being  ‘strongly  agree,’  and  5  being  ‘strongly  disagree.’

5.1  Sample  Characteristics 
378  students  of  a  private  university  from  India  participated in this study. The participating colleges and  number of students from each discipline are as follows:  Health and Allied Health Sciences (128), Technical (195)  and  Management  (55).  There  were  268  male  and  110  female  students  participated  in  this  study.  The  average  age of the respondent was 21.77% were undergraduates,  and  23%  were  postgraduates. 
5.2  Analysis  of  Measurement  Model 
The confirmatory factor analysis was used to verify  the  factor  structure  of  the  measurement  instrument. All  28  items  were  significantly  loaded  onto  the  respective  constructs. The loading fell above 0.7 except for PEOU1  (0.611)  which  was  removed  for  further  analysis  in  the  measurement model (Table 1). The bivariate relationships

alpha  was  calculated  to  assess  the  reliability  of  each  construct. According  to hair39, et  al.  Cronbach’s  alpha  score  of  at  least  0.70  is  considered  as  acceptable  for  internal consistency. The reliability value of each factor  is shown in Table 1. The construct validity was inspected  by  examining  the  convergent  validity  and  discriminant  validity.  Convergent  validity  was  assessed  by  the  score  of  Composite  Reliability  (CR)  and  Average  Variance  Extracted  (AVE)40.  The  value  of  CR  should  be  at  least  0.741. The results confirmed the reliability of the scales.  The constructs of the proposed research model also show  theacceptable convergent validity and discriminant validity  (Table 3). According to hair42 AVE  estimates  should  be  0.5  or  greater  so  as  to  suggest  the  adequate  convergent  validity.  Table  1  shows  that  the  AVE  are  all  above  the  benchmark  of  0.5,  which  demonstrates  that  there  exists  convergent  validity  among  the  constructs  measured.  To

Perceived usefulness of the internet for academic activity  was predicted by perceived ease of use (β= 0.66, p< 0.001),  resulting  in  R2  of  0.43,  which  means  PEOU  accounted  for  a  43%  variance  in  PU. Therefore,  H1  is  supported. 
Attitude towards using the Internet for the academic  purpose was predicted both by PU (β=0.54, p<0.001) and  PEOU (β=0.24, p<0.001) resulting in R2 of 0.53, which  means  PU  and  PEOU  jointly  accounted  for  53%  of  the  variance  in ATI. Therefore,  H2  and  H3  is  supported. 
Behavioral  intention  of  students  using  the  Internet  for  their  academic  purposes  was  predicted  by  their  perceived  usefulness  of  the  Internet  (β=0.26,  p<0.001)  and  student’s  attitude  towards  the  internet  (β=0.60,  
test discriminant validity, it is suggested that the AVE per  
p<0.001).  The  resulting  R2  of  0.65,  indicates  that  the  
perceived usefulness of the internet and students’ attitude  
construct should be higher than the correlations between  any two different constructs40. AVE matrices can be seen  in  Table  3,  with  the  AVE  on  the  diagonal  and  squared  correlations  among  constructs  on  the  off-diagonal.  The  results specify that the elements in the principal diagonal  were  greater  than  the  off-diagonal  elements  confirming  the  presence  of  discriminant  validity. 
To  test  the  hypothesis,  a  structural  model  (Fig.  2)  was  built.  The  model  indices  for  the  structural  model  fit  are  as  follows:  CMIN/DF  =2.436,  RMSEA=0.062,  SRMR=0.0597, CFI=0.921, IFI=0.921, TLI=0.912. The result  indicated satisfactory fit between the model and observed  data.  Fig.  2  shows  the  results  of  the  structural  model.  The test offers the standardised path coefficients between  model  constructs  and  also  their  statistical  significance.  The test also produces the squared multiple correlations  (R2),  which  indicates  the  variance  of  the  dependent  constructs.

together accounted for 65% of the variance in Behavioral  Intention. Therefore, h4  and h5  are  supported. 
The  actual  use  of  the  Internet  by  the  students  for  the  academic  purpose  was  predicted  by  their  behavioral  intention (β=0.74, p<0.001) resulting in R2 of 0.55, which  means  the  behavioral  intention  of  students  in  using  the  internet was accounted for 55% of the variance in actual  usage  of  internet  for  the  academic  purposes. 
6.    dISCUSSI onS 
The study examines the factors that influence students’  actual usage of internet for their academic purposes and  the causal relationships amongst the constructs utilising  the  proposed  research  framework  based  on  original  TAM.  The  study  results  supported  the  proposed  model  significantly.  The  results  of  this  study  uncover  that  perceived  usefulness  and  attitude  towards  the  internet  are  the  significant  factors  in  determining  the  students’  behavioral  intention  in  using  the  internet  for  academic  purposes.  These  two  constructs  together  explained  65%  of  the  variance  of  behavioral  intention. A  similar  study  conducted by Bidin9   on  internet  usage  for  the  academic  purpose also concludes that attitude variable significantly  explains  variance  in  intention.  The  study  of  online  learning  illustrates  that  the  students'  perception  of  ease  of  use,  usefulness,  attitudes  towards  online  learning,  and  the  social  impact  of  students'  referent  group  are  identified as substantial factors of thestudents' intention to  practice online learning41. The study directed on students’

outlook  on  learning  management  systems  also  discloses  that  there  is  a  significant  relationship  between  attitude  toward  using  technology  and  behavioral  intention  to  use  technology. Also,  there  is  a  significant  relationship  amongst  actual  technology  use  and  behavioral  intention  to use technology33. A recent study conducted by Sharma  &  Chandel11   found  that  there  is  positive  relationship  amid  attitude  and  behavioral  intention  in  the  direction  of  learning  through  websites.  
The  results  of  this  study  also  show  that  behavioral  intention of students is a key aspect of using the internet  for  their  academic  purposes.  It  clarifies  55%  of  the  variance  of  actual  usage  of  internet.  This  finding  is  in  accordance  with  the  study  conducted  by  Bidin9,   et  al. ,  which  exhibits  that  attitude  and  perceived  usefulness  significantly impact the intention to use the internet for  academic  purposes  at  p  <  .01.  Findings  of  this  study  also  reveal  that  attitude  towards  using  the  Internet  is  significantly predicted by both perceived usefulness and  perceived  ease  of  using  the  Internet.  It  represented  for  53% of the variance in the students’ attitude towards the  internet.  This  is  in  line  with  the  findings  of  the  earlier  study conducted by Fathema; Shannon & Ross30. The study  also indicates that perceived ease of using the Internet is

Based  on  the  findings  of  this  study,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  use  of the Internet by the students is determined by the four  constructs  as  proposed  in  TAM.  The  findings  of  this  study  also  suggest  that  the  existing  framework  of  TAM  applies  to  understand  the  actual  usage  of  the  internet  by  the  students  for  academic  purposes.
