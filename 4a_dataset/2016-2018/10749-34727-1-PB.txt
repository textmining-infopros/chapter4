ABSTRACT 
Determining use patterns and information seeking behaviour of users is consequential to enhance library  collections, facilities, and services. This paper tends to investigate information seeking behaviour and use pattern  of students on quality of procured information in National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, India. Survey research  method is adopted for the study. Analysis of data is done through percentage count. It is found that 70 per cent are  aware about the e-journals and databases. The result indicated that both print and electronic e-journals are highly  preferred by students but access them in other places then departmental library and 32.22 per cent respondents  spent time more than hours for internet access. The study will be useful for the academic librarians in improving  the shortcomings of their institutes and will procure the required e-journals for their Institutes.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
For  the  development  and  survival  of  human  beings,  information  is  momentous.  Any  society’s  progress  mainly  depends  on  right  information  at  required  time.  Today’s  existing  environment  with  plenty  of  information  sources,  diverse  retrieving  information  methods,  no  longer  used  content  may  provoke  anxiety  and  belief  in  inadequacy  of  information among information users. The signifcant aspect  of  research  and  academics  is  information.  In  developing  countries, researchers for scholarly information now depend  mainly  on  internet  and  various  library  consortia1.  Several  models  have  been  developed  in  the  procedure  of  seeking  and  searching  for  information  in  academic  or  professional  environments.  The  models  have  not  delineated  on  how  users identify, what or how much information is enough to  accomplish their objectives2. Imperative information should  be used properly and provided after ascertaining information  needs and seeking behaviour of users3.  
‘Information  needs  (need  for  information)  is  a  factual  situation in which there exists an inseparable inter connection  with  ‘information’  and  ‘need’;  information  originates  and  generated  because  there  exists  a  need  or  an  interest4-5.  Information  seeking  behaviour  can  be  described  as  an  individual’s  manner  of  gathering  and  sourcing  information  for  personal  use,  knowledge  updating  and  development6.  The  person  has  distinctive  information  needs  which  keeps  on  changing  and  not  receptive  to  generalisation7. Although,  information need is distinguished by the information seeking

behaviour  of  the  person.  Broadly,  information  seeking  behaviour is an individual’s requirement of resolute information  which is searched, evaluated and used by him to satisfy his/her  urge to know and updating of knowledge8.  
Focus of librarians in today’s digital world should be on  providing more and updated electronic resources and secondly,  technology based training programmes for user’s as well as for  librarians to enhance their skills. The information needs and  information seeking behaviour of students of NIT, Jalandhar,  includes  graduates,  postgraduates  and  researcher. They  have  peculiar information need established on their job like other  specialised  profession.  Engineers  have  pronounced  role  in  uplifting technology and inducing social change. 
2.  LITERATURE REvIEw 
In off a metropolis, Nigeria9  women artisan’s information  needs, their seeking behaviour and sources through which they  obtain information were explored. The study also identifed  barriers to accessing information. It was found that they often  need the information on raw materials (55.7 per cent) followed  by fnancial matters (53.8 per cent). Information were often  obtained  by  women  artisan  from  the  association  of  their  occupation (69.5 per cent) followed by radio and television  stations (55.2 per cent). Naushad & Faizul10  undertakes the  study  at  Central  Science  Library,  University  of  Delhi  to  examine the extent to which research scholars were aware and  use e-journals. The result revealed that respondents (60 per  cent) was using e-journals weekly and majority users consult  printed journals than e-journals for the purpose of research.  Another  study11   on  information  seeking  behaviour  was  conducted in Nigeria of humanities undergraduate students

of three universities. The result revealed that respondents (65.2  per  cent)  browse  the  library  collections  to  retrieve  relevant  information materials and (55.6 per cent) used lecturers and  colleagues as starting point to obtain academic information.  A survey carried out at Manchester University and research  chemists  at  the  University  of  Sheffeld  on  physicists

  to  analyse  the  patterns  of  information  seeking  through  the  interviews.  The  study  identifed  similarities  and  differences  between  the  two  groups.  The  results  were  analysed  and  compared  with  the  fndings  of  the  previous  study  of  the  social  scientists.  While  reviewing  literature,  it  is  observed  that few studies were conducted on NIT library users. Thus,  the  previous  studies  instigated  researchers  to  study  seeking  behaviour and use-pattern of users of NIT library, Jalandhar  which  will  help  the  library  professional  to  provide  services  according to needs of users. 
3.  OBJECTIvES  
The  study  which  lacks  objectives  is  incomplete.  The  objectives  formulated  on  basis  of  research  question  are  as  follows: 
(i)  To  determine  the  awareness  among  users  for  using  
e-journals 
(ii)  To discover the satisfaction level of users while accessing  
electronic journals 
(iii)  To identify the purpose for using e-journals 
(iv)  To ascertain training requirement for user for accessing  
e-journals.  
4.  SCOPE AND  METHODOLOGY  
The research setting is National Institute of Technology,  Jalandhar,  India.  For  the  study,  survey  research  is  used.  A  structured questionnaire is prepared to collect primary data. It  consists of 14 questions. The population for study consists of  library members of the Institute. Questionnaires are distributed  among  100  students  in  the  library  of  National  Institute  of  Technology, Jalandhar out of which 90 flled questionnaires was  selected  for  analysis. The  authors  adopted  random  sampling  technique to select participants from each stratum. percentage  method is used for analysing the data. 
5.  DATA ANALYSIS AND  FINDINGS 
In  research  process,  analysis  of  data  is  momentous.  Notable  results  can  be  drawn  through  analysis  of  raw  data,  which leads to conclusions.  
5.1 Gender  Information  on  the  Respondents 
The analysis of data regarding the gender characteristics  of the respondents that took part in the survey shows that out  of the 90 respondents, 66 per cent indicated as male students,  while 34 per cent indicated as female students. 
5.2 Category  of  Course 
The analysis of data regarding categories of class course  of respondents undertaken shown in Table 1 which indicated  that 67.78 per cent are from MTech, 23.33 per cent are BTech  while only 8.89 per cent are Research scholars.

The study revealed that students with the highest rating 70  per  cent  are  aware  about  the  e-journals  and  databases  followed  by  30  per  cent  who  are  not  aware  about  available  resources in library. 
The preference of format was asked by the respondents  to  enhance  the  usability  of  library  resources,  thus,  helps  in  procuring desired resource format. The result indicated in Table  2 that both print and electronic e-journals are highly preferred  by  students  may  be  due  to  printed  journals  authenticity,  accuracy  whereas  electronic  journals  are  provide  current  information,  easy  to  use,  and  saves  time.  This  reveals  that  27.78 per cent respondents use electronic journals to retrieve  information materials probably due to their inability to search  right information at right time from printed journals. 
Provision  of  internet  connectivity  is  signifcant  for  accessing  e-journals  by  library. The  respondents  were  asked  the area where they access e-journals. It is interesting to note  that user’s prefer to access through other places 50 per cent as  compared to central library 31.11 per cent and departmental  library  18.89  per  cent.  This  is  due  to  lack  of  infrastructure  facilities and poor internet connectivity. 
The respondents were asked about preference of fle format  for using the electronic journals. It is evident from analysis that  72.22 per cent respondents prefer to use ‘pDF’ format followed  by 22.22 per cent ‘No preference’ for using e-journals.  
The  respondents  were  asked  to  indicate  the  preference  for saving the fle while accessing the electronic journals. The  analysis of data is as shown in Table 1. The result revealed that  70 per cent of users prefer to download the fle so that it can be  again used as and whenever required as compared to 22.22 per  cent respondent who takes the print out of the required fle. A  few number of respondents7.78 per cent sent the fle in mail. 
5.2.1 Time Spent for Internet Access 
Higher education is signifcantly affected by information  technology, even the process of teaching, learning and research.

5.2.2 Frequency  of  using  E-journals 
Majority  of  libraries  provide  information  services  and  facilities to their users for optimum usage of their resources  by using information technology. The users were asked on the  frequency  of  using  e-journals,  analysis  is  depicted  in  Table  3. It is found that 32.22 per cent use e-journals ‘As & when  required’ followed by 30 per cent on ‘Daily’ basis. The result  indicated that only 4.45 per cent respondent’s uses e-journals  ‘Once in fortnight’ and 6.67 per cent ‘Once a week’.

5.2.3 Retrieving  Information  from  E-journals  
Available  in  Library 
The respondents were asked about their efforts involved  in retrieving information from available electronic resources  in  library. The  result  of  analysis  depicts  that  55.55  per  cent  respondents fnd information from e-journals ‘To some extent’  followed by 20 per cent ‘With diffculty’. It is noted that only  15.56 per cent fnd information ‘Easily’ followed by 3.33 per  cent  ‘Very  easily’.  The  fndings  depicted  that  students  are  still not aware of using e-journals. Thus, need is required for  enhancing their skills in using e-journals.

5.2.5 Satisfaction  Level  of Accessing  E-journals 
Table  5  shows  the  analysis  of  data  on  the  responses  to  the level of satisfaction of users of accessing e-journals. It is  found that 32.22 per cent users were satisfed with accessing of  e-journals provided by their institute library as against 44.44  per cent who indicated their average satisfaction. It is revealed  that 6.67 per cent were highly satisfed as compared to 16.67  per cent students who indicated their non-satisfaction. 
Overall, it is noted that the more than half of the users were  averagely satisfed of accessing e-journals. It might be due to  inability to retrieve the information from available e-journals  in their institute library. Further more, it is discovered that none  respondent reported ‘Neutral’ about the query asked.

5.2.6 Preferred  Linking  Facility  for  using  E-journals 
The institute through their web pages or websites facilitate  the  users  with  their  resources  and  services  and  users  can  retrieve information even about library and institute anytime,  anywhere at great speed. The NIT library in Jalandhar did not  have  website  but  web  page  of  library  integrated  with  their  Institute website. 
Respondents were questioned to highlight linking facility  for using e-journals to know which were most preferred than  other mentioned (Table 6). It is observed that 46.67 per cent  users  were  accessing  e-journals  from  the  library  websites/ webpages.  It  is  also  noted  that  23.33  per  cent  users  are  accessing the search engines whereas 7.78 per cent of users are  searching the e-journal websites. 11.11 per cent respondents  didn’t respond.

5.2.10 Training  for  using  E-journals 
Table 10 indicates the kind of training needed with the  use of e-journals. It is revealed that 33.34 per cent of the users  indicated  that  there  is  need  ‘Information  retrieval  training’,  followed by ‘presentation of different journals’ 23.34 per cent.  The  respondents  14.44  per  cent  each  indicated  ‘Information  about  contents’;  ‘Information  technology  training’;  ‘No  training required’ are mentioned for training. 
It is to conclude that the training of users with regard to  use of e-journals is required for optimising the use of available  e-journals in library.

6.  FINDINGS AND  SUGGESTIONS 
It is found that 70 per cent respondents are aware about  the  e-journals  and  databases.  The  result  indicated  that  both  print and electronic e-journals are highly preferred by students.  The  study  indicated  that  purpose  of  using  e-journals  among  students  is  for  their  research  work.  Students  also  indicated  that they are averagely satisfed with available e-journals and  wanted more required journals. When asked about any training  required students indicated that they desire to have information  retrieval training. 
While  conducting  survey,  users  suggested  few  required  immediate changes. Some notable suggestions are:  (a) Need of Information retrieval training for students (b) Need of orientation programs by the library staff to make  
users aware about the available e-journals and train them  
for effective and exhaustive use of e-journals 
(c) Make provision for access of e-journals from hostels also (d) Required e-journals should be procured more and provide  
even from consortia’s 
(e) The  marketing  of  library  services  are  highly  
recommended 
(f) The  library  professional  should  willingly  provide  
assistance to students in need and 
(g) Infrastructure  facilities  should  be  enhanced  to  
accommodate  students  and  faculty  for  accessing  the  
e-resources.

7. CONCLUSIONS 
Numbers  of  facets  infuence  the  information  needs,  seeking behaviour and use pattern, which becomes prerequisite  to determine the substantial needs of information users. The  collection of effcacious resources of library is signifcant in  accomplishing  its  goals  and  meeting  needs  of  their  users13.  procuring effective and useful resources keeping in mind the  demands and requirement of users will satisfy library’s users  and  increase  their  frequency  of  visits  in  library.  The  study  reveals that students are aware about the e-journals available  and both print and electronic journals are preferred by users.  provision of effectual internet connectivity within the library  and outside will further improve the usage of library resources.  It is noted that e-journals are used for the research work but  unable to retrieve it properly. Thus, library staff support and  guidance is truly needed. Trained staff can guide them as per  needs and make them familiar with new techniques and tools  which helps them to cater their information needs.
