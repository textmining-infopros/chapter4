This paper reports usage and experience of e-resources medical students at Maharishi Markandeshwar  University, Ambala Haryana. In this study it is try to verify and evaluate the purpose, frequency, reasons of  using and place of students access to e-resources. A well structured questionnaire was administered to the  100 medical students. The response rate was 78% (45 from Postgraduates and 33 from Undergraduates  students). The  result  of  study  reveals  that  most  of  P.G.  and  U.G.  students  state  that  e-resources  are  informative as well as update the medical knowledge. Search engine and medical research reports are  used highly among the students. Further study shows that undergraduate students use e-resources daily  and spent more time as compared to P.G. students. It is found that maximum students are aware and  use e-resources of library. The satisfaction of medical students is not high with regard to e-resources.  Study also reveals that PG students feel that e-resources are time consuming and face slow downloading  whereas  UG  students  face  virus,  slow  downloading  and  feel  more  expensive  of  using  e-resources.

1.  IntrodUCtIon 
The  developments  in  computing  technology  changed in all fields of education with transacting of  information society to the digital world where people  access  and  use  information  every  day  faster  and  easier.  E-resources  have  become  highly  important  learning  and  teaching  aids  in  almost  every  field  of  science. It has created a great revolution in the field  of  medical  publication,  data  storage  and  retrieval  as  a  new  medium.  In  medical  education,  they  are  of  particular  interest  for  the  study  of  anatomy.  In  this  field,  the  availability  of  visual  information  is  essential  to  obtain  a  functional  three-dimensional  (3D)  image  of  the  human  body  and  its  tissues1.  The  tremendous  growth  of  medical  information  publication  available  in  various  formats  as  fast  as  possible  is  needed  which  definitely  requires  information and communication technology. In order  to  work  in  compliance  with  this  evolution,  medical  students need the awareness, skills for management  of  information  and  communication  effectively  and  efficiently  and  the  ability  to  utilise  various  facilities  and  equipment  in  the  electronic  databases2.  
Also, with development of e-resources collection  in various universities are growing, presently we see  the  increasing  demand  of  e-resources  by  medical  students  in  the  competitive  time  of  education  and  research  in  all  over  the  world.  E-resources  have  become  as  boons  to  the  medical  students  and  
attract  them  in  the  digital  environments  in  their  limited  amount  of  time.  Use  of  e-resources  by  medical  student  may  up-to-date  knowledge  in  their  respective  subject  field  and  to  improve  the  quality  of  learning,  growing  rapidly  and  play  a  vital  role  in  education  and  research. 
Medical students today are very comfortable with  electronic  resources  that  have  become  an  integral  part  as  well  as  facilitate  self-directed  learning  among  them.  With  the  rising  use  of  e-resources  in  higher  education,  an  ever-increasing  amount  of  research  has  been  conducted  into  its  educational  value.  However,  such  research  has  been  found  to  focus  on  student  usage  pattern  of  e-resources.  When developing e-resources in medical education,  student need to understand not only their academic  value,  but  also  how  they  use  and  experience  of  e-resources.  Students  need  more  guidance  of  the  limits  of  individual  logs  to  a  source  of  information  and  more  assistant  to  access  the  clinical  data  of  broader  resources  such  as  databases3.

Bhatti  &  Javed4   found  that  the  e-resources  were  used  sometimes  (Pubmed)  and  occasionally  (MedScape,  PakMediNet  and  EBSCOhost)  with  second preference of the students due to scarcity of  ICT  infrastructure  as  well  as  lack  of  digital  literacy  among  students.  Bhat  &  Mudhol5   observed  that  Anesthesiologist had the first position of satisfaction  with  all  search  engines.  General  medicine  and  Neurology  respondents  used  e-resources  mostly.  The  study  also  found  that  e-resources  accessed  more  and  more  at  departments  or  on  personal  desktop/laptops  by  respondents  that  seem  to  be  decreased  the  value  of  libraries  as  gateway  of  e-resources in future. Sohail & Alvi6  concluded that  100  %  of  the  students  were  aware  and  used  for  retrieving  quick  information  of  web  resources  as  reliable  resources  generally  in  cyber  cafe  as  well  as  with  personal  connection  and  satisfied  with  the  web services provide by college. Singh & Gill7  found  that maximum numbers of respondents were aware  availability  of  e-journals  and  used  pdf  format  for  their  research  work  at  their  office  daily.  Varghese,  et  al.,8   had  pointed  out  that  98  %  of  students  used  the  e-resources  frequently  to  varying  that  usefulness, to prepare for periodic formative and final  summative assessments in the course as well as to  
11 
understood the subject (83 %), to answer questions  in  assessments  (86  %),  to  study  the  subject  (59  %) and biochemistry interesting (73 %). Maharana,  et  al.,9   found  that  1/3  of  the  students  have  a  long  experience  of  using  internet  and  e-resources  from  2-4  years  and  all  are  more  or  less  aware  of  the  applications of internet technology. Thanuskodi10  had  carried out a study and found that CD-ROM medical  database on Highwire Press and PubMed were the  first preference of the medical professionals with mean  score of 4.15 and faced the problems of virus, lack  of information technology (IT) knowledge, long time  to  view  information,  slow  accessibility,  lack  of  time  and too much information retrieved. Graber, et al.,11 explored  that  medical  students  spent  significantly  more  time  on  the  case  than  did  the  other  students  (p<  0.05)  by  used  google  for  research  and  solve  the  CPC  cases,  followed  by  Isabel,  eMedicine.  Johnson12     examined  the  significant  difference  (P  <  0.002  using  a  two-tailed  unpaired  t-test)  and  describe  that  online  preparation  for  high-stakes  examinations could improve student performance in  medical  microbiology.  Gilmour,  et  al.,13   found  that  most  respondents  had  internet  access  at  home  to  improve  the  practice  and    to  expressed  the  quality  of online information. Scott, et al.,14  investigated the  e-learning asthma resource was a useful supplement  to  the  paediatric  asthma  lecture  and  workshop  that  helpful  to  improve  clinical  practice.  Romanov  &  Aarnio15   did  a  survey  and  found  that  MEDLINE  bibliography  database  is  used  by  medical  students  for study (24 %), research (32 %) and for scientific  work (32 %) Terveyspotti. Renwick16   observed  that  respondents  had  high  awareness  of  the  electronic  resources out of which 73 % used computers daily,  83 % were self-taught and 60 % expressed a need  for training. Dorup17  conducted a survey and found  that  computer  and  internet  was  used  at  home  by  the  respondents  of  71.7  %  and  60  %  respectively.  90  %  students  used  e-mail  regularly,  80  %  used  the  internet  regularly.

4.  MEthodo Logy 
The  study  is  limited  to  use  of  the  e-resources  by post and under graduate students of the Institute  of  Medical  Sciences  &  Research  at  MM  University  of Ambala (Haryana). This study is based on survey  method. The questionnaire tool was used to collect  primary data from the medical students. A total 100  questionnaires  were  distributed  randomly  among  medical students. Out of which 45 from postgraduates  (MD/MS)  and  33  from  the  undergraduates  (MBBS)  students  received  back  with  78  %  response  rate.  The  chi-square  test  was  used  at  0.01  %  level  of  significance to know the variation of usage e-resources  among  PG  and  UG  medical  students.    
5. hypothESES 
The following null hypotheses were formulated and  tested  by  employing  chi-square  statistical  tool.  H1–   There is no significant difference between the  
            PG  and  UG  medical  students  in  using  the  
              various  types  of  e-resources. 
H2–     There is no significant difference between search  
  strategy  of  PG  and  UG  medical 
    students  for  accessing  e-resources.  H3–    There  is  no  significance  difference  between  
    the  PG  and  UG  students  for  the  purpose   
    of  using  e-resources. 
H4–    There  is  no  significance  difference  between  
   PG and UG students in accessing frequency 
    of  e-resources. 
H5–   There is no significance difference with regard  
    to  the  satisfaction  level  of  PG  and  UG  
    students  with  e-resources. 
6.   AnALySIS 
Students  were  asked  to  locate  the  type  of  e-resources frequently used. It is clear from Table 1  that  maximum  number  of  PG  and  UG  students  frequently  used  search  engines  (18  PG  and  13  UG) and E-research Report (15 PG and 20 UG). 6  of  PG  and  3  UG  gave  the  preference  to  video  to  use. However, UG students did responded regarding  the  usages  preference  of  e-journals,  e-books,  ETD,  e-encyclopedia,  and  online  databases.The  calculated  value  of  χ2   (26.45)  is  greater  than  the  critical value (18.4753), i.e., 26.45 > 18.4753. This  shows that there is signifance difference among the  PG  and  UG  medical  students  to  use  the  various  types  of  e-resources;  it  has  found  that  maximum  
number  of  students  used  e-research  reports.  It  is  identified with the statistical analysis of Chi-square  the  structured  hypothesis  H1   is  rejected  at  0.01  level  of  significant. 
Every user has a nature to access e-resources  with different approach. An attempt was made to know  which approach is mostly used among PG and UG  medical  students. Table  2  shows  that  title  is  highly  used  by  students  (27  PG  and  19  UG)  to  access

Table  3    and  Figure  1  shows  the  purpose  of  students  to  use  e-resources.  Majority  of  students,  i.e.,  36  of  PG  and  33  of  UG  use  e-resources  for  updating  medical  knowledge,  9  of  PG  students  and  3  of  UG  use  for  education  and  for  research,  table  2.

Therefore,  UG  students  have  no  response  to  the  query  of  e-resources usages for patient care, health information,  to  access  PubMed,  medical  databases  access  and  entertainment.  The  calculated  value  of  chi-square  is  less  than  critical  value,  i.e.,  16.15  <  21.6659.  There is no significance difference between the PG  and  UG  students  purpose  to  use  e-resources.  The  decision  is  accepted  the  null  hypothesis H3. 
Table  4  highlights  the  response  of  students  regarding  the  reason  for  using  e-resources.    The  data from the table describes that maximum numbers  of students’, i.e., 24 of PG and 30 of UG state that  e-resources are more informative, 6 numbers of PG  and  3  of  UG  students  response  that  e-resources  are  time  saving  and  more  useful.  It  is  to  be  noted  from the table that UG students give no response to  the query of easy to use and less expensive, while  PG students have the opinion that e-resources are  easy  (12)  to  use  and  less  expensive  (6). The  chi- square test shows that there is significant variation  among  the  PG  and  UG  student  reason  for  using  e-resources.

To  know  the  access  frequency  of  e-resources,  students  were  asked  how  frequently  they  use  e-resources. It is clear from Table 5 that 18 numbers  of  PG  students  use  e-resources  daily,  21  use  once  a  week  and  6  numbers  of  PG  students  use  e-resources  more  than  once  a  week.  Whereas  UG  students give the response that they use e-resources  daily.  Chi-square  test  result  does  not  support  the  null hypothesis and there is significance difference  between the access frequency of e-resources among  PG and UG students and structured null hypothesis  H4   is  rejected.

Figure 2. Chi-Square (χ2) distribution with ν= 5 degrees  
of freedom, then p= Pr[X ≥ 46.480]= 0.0000. students  access  e-resources  over  20  hours  in  a  week. It is clear from the chi-square test that there  is  significance  variance  between  time  spent  on  usages  of  e-resources  by  PG  and  UG  students. 
Table  7    and  Figure  3  shows  the  place  of  e-resources access and describes that 27 numbers  of  PG  and  26  of  UG  students  use  e-resources  at  library, 15 of PG and 7 of UG students use at home.  Data  of  the  table  presents  that  same  numbers  of  students, i.e., 9 use e-resources at computer lab (6  PG  and  3  UG)  and  any  other  place  (4  PG  and  5  UG), 2 PG students use e-resources at department  whereas  not  a  single  UG  student  use  e-resources  at  department.  There  is  no  significance  variance  among  the  access  place  of  e-resources  because  the  calculated  value  (4.34)  is  less  than  the  critical  value  (13.2767).  
It  is  evident  from  Table  8  that  students  were  aware  about  the  e-resources  by  various  approach.  The majority of students (15 PG and 26 UG) aware

about e-resources from library notice/e-mail. 27 PG  and  3  of  UG  students  became  aware  from  their  colleagues, 6 PG and 3 of UG students aware about  current e-resources from library brochure and other  library  respectively.  6  numbers  of  students  (3  PG  and  3  UG)  are  aware  from  teacher.  The  value  of  chi-square  is  29.18  and  degree  of  freedom  is  4.  The value of p reveals the statistically significance  (p<4.01).  The  variation  among  students  has  been  found as for as awareness approach to e-resources  is  concerned.  
Table 9  and Figure 4 indicates the satisfaction  level of students with e-resources. The result of the  study found that 20 of PG and 9 of UG students are  very  satisfied  with  e-resources,  12  PG  and  7  UG  students,  i.e.,  19  students  are  somewhat  satisfied  and dissatisfied are 3 of PG students and 1 of UG  students.  The  study  also  found  that  10  of  PG  and  16  of  UG  students  gave  no  comments  regarding  satisfaction with e-resources. The chi-square test is  significant at 0.01 level of significance.

Table  10  depicts  that  maximum  number  of  PG  students  (21)  are  not  using  e-resources  because  of  slow  downloading  this is followed by time consuming (18), 6 students  are  not  using  because    of  expensive  nature,    3  students  state  that  lack  of  subject  coverage,  lack  of  training,  lack  of  time  and  2  students  did  not  give  any  reason.  On  the  other  hand  UG  students  are  not  using  e-resources  due  to  it  being  more  expensive  (20),  slow  downloading,  virus  (6)  any  other  reason  (5),  lack  of  training  and  time  (3).   There is a significance difference among the reason  of  not  using  e-resources  by  PG  and  UG  students.  The  calculated  value  of  Chi-square  test  is  39.24  greater  than  the  critical  value  at  1  %  of  7  degree  of  freedom.

8.  ConCLUSIonS 
Today all type of medical information is available  in electronic formats. The e-resources play a drastic  role  among  the  medical  students  community  in  accessing  and  sharing  of  information.  E-resources  keep  medical  students  up-to-date  over  traditional  resources. The present study is conducted with the  objective  to  know  the  e-resources  usage  patterns  among the postgraduate and undergraduate medical  students  at  Maharishi  Markandeshwar  University,  Ambala Haryana. The study found significant difference  among  PG  and  UG  students  in  relation  to  the  use  of  various  types  of  e-resources,  search  strategy,  reason for using e-resources and access frequency  except purpose. However, result shows that medical  students frequently used search engines as well as  e-research report by title and subject of the required  information  for  updating  medical  knowledge. 
The  result  of  the  study  shows  that  maximum  medical  students  state  that  e-resources  are  more  
15 
informative.  All  the  undergraduate  students  use  e-resources  daily  and  spent  more  time  than  the  postgraduate  students.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  a  large  number  of  students  are  aware  of  the  e-resources from library notice/e-mail and colleagues,  and use library to access the e-resources. The result  of  the  study  found  that  the  satisfaction  level  was  not  high  among  PG  and  UG  students  on  usage  of  e-resources. 
The  study  also  finds  out  the  major  problems  PG  students  feel  for  using  e-resources  are  time  consuming  and  face  slow  downloading  whereas  UG students face virus, slow downloading and feel   that  using  e-resources  makes  it  more  expensive.  To  develop  a  fully  e-educational  environment  and  reducing  the  problems  of  students,  it  is  needed  to  develop a modern digital infrastructure. It is evident  from  the  study  that  medical  library  of  Maharishi  Markandeshwar  University  is  leading  to  create  environment  for  the  attraction  of  the  students.  Therefore, much more is need to be done to make  maximum  access  of  e-resources.  E-resources  are  easy  to  access  at  any  place  any  time,  provide  right  information  at  right  time,  and  have  become  widely  used  tools  in  medical  literature  and  patient  care education today as well as have benefits over  traditional  educational  resources.  Every  academic  Institute provides different facilities and services to  its  students.  Library  is  one  of  the  most  important  facilities  among  students  to  grow  the  carrier.
