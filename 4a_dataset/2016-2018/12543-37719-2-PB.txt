ABSTRACT 
Based on the primary data collected from the library and information science professionals working in the higher  education sector of the Jammu and Kashmir, the study aims to assess, as how far the application of information  and communication technology apart from improving the library services and activities, has been instrumental in  improving the job satisfaction among the library and information professionals. In all 264 responses were generated  from the respondents, a whopping, 68.9 per cent respondents are of the view that library and information science  professionals contribute signifcantly into the teaching and research activities of their institution. 61 per cent respondents  have shown satisfaction with the information technology infrastructure in their respective libraries, while as, 60.2  per cent respondents are of the view that the application of information technology in libraries contribute to the  job satisfaction of library professionals. Still more, 43.9 per cent respondents viewed that the library professionals  working in the manual environment show lower levels of job satisfaction.

1. InTRoduCTIon 
The success of any institution or an organisation solely  depends on its human resource and the human resource which  is skilled and technically sound, is always deemed as an asset  to the institution or an organisation. But, if the same human  resource  is  not  satisfed  with  an  organisation  on  one  or  the  other account, this dissatisfaction is bound affect the overall  productivity  of  the  organisation  and  so  holds  true  about  the  library professionals. Till recent past, the library professionals  more  often  used  to  rate  their  job  as  more  monotonous,  less  interactive  and  least  attractive,  hence  the  professionals  used  to  show  lower  levels  of  job  satisfaction.  Although  salary,  work  environment,  interpersonal  relationship,  recognition,  advancement, job security, etc, are some of the prime variables  which  contribute  signifcantly  to  the  job  satisfaction  of  an  employee, but apart from these, there are other factors as well  which contribute towards the job satisfaction or dissatisfaction  among  employees.  Accordingly,  in  the  modern  times,  application of information and communication technology in  handling the routine services and activities in an organisation  is being seen as an important variable, which contributes to the  job satisfaction among employees.  
It is an established fact that the application of information  and  communication  technology  has  transformed  the  every  sphere of human activity and so holds true about the application  of  IT  in  libraries.  Post  1990,  like  every  other  institution,  
Received : 11 January 2017, Revised : 05 February 2018  Accepted : 08 February 2018, Online published : 23 March 2018 
libraries  all  across  the  world  experienced  a  soft  revolution,  whereby a growing trend was observed towards the application  of soft technology in handling the routine library services and  activities. The introduction of IT in libraries, not just reshaped  the ways and means of doing the routine library services and  activities,  but  also  turned  the  job  for  library  professionals  more  interactive,  hence  infused  a  new  zeal  among  library  professionals in rendering services to the users, which in turn  is being seen as having improved the job satisfaction among  the library professionals.  
The application of IT has helped libraries to move beyond  the four walls by adding a whole new lot of services in this IT  driven world. Application of IT in libraries is certain to expand  and  add  new  roles  and  responsibilities,  so  would  IT  help  in  opening up new opportunities, which will ultimately serve them  with greater job satisfaction1. Accordingly, the present study is  an attempt to assess the impact of information technology on the  overall job satisfaction of library and information professionals  in general and those working in the higher education sector in  the Jammu & Kashmir in particular.  
1.1 Problem  Statement 
Looking  back,  libraries  as  sub-institutions  of  the  larger  institutions  were  seen  as  custody  of  books  and  librarians  as  custodians, who were more aimed to preserve the documents  rather to optimise their use among the information seeker. This  conventional image of a library professional somewhere still  haunts the present day library professionals, who more or less  are not satisfed with their job to the extent they otherwise should

have been. There is no denying in the fact that in the absence  of IT, libraries were less attractive and least challenging, but  introduction of IT has made libraries more interactive, which  warrants the need to assess as how far the IT has improved the  job satisfaction among the library professionals.

3. LITERATuRE  REVIEW  
Studies in the past have revealed that IT has considerably  improved  the  state  of  the  library  profession  and  so  has  application  of  IT  in  libraries  helped  in  dragging  better  job  satisfaction  among  the  library  professionals.  The  higher  the  levels  of  job  satisfaction  among  employees,  the  better  will  be their job performance2. The introduction of IT in libraries  apart  from  helping  with  the  job  monitoring,  has  made  the  routine library activities more interactive and satisfying than  the  library  activities  undertaken  during  non-automated  era,  omit it, but keep citation number3. However, in a similar study  undertaken  by  Waters  among  the  library  professionals  of  Tasmania observed that there is no direct correlation between  the job satisfaction and the IT, which is independent of it4.  
Information  technology  has  considerably  improved  the  library services and activities, and the outcome of rendering  such services was not so satisfactory when rendered manually5. Information  technology  has  changed  the  role  of  reference  librarians  to  a  great  deal  and  so  has  it  helped  the  library  professionals to reduce their job stress. While surveying over  200 library professionals Plammi observed that IT apart from  giving respite from the manual ways of doing work has also  helped to overcome the heavy workloads6  and understaffng,  mostly the libraries and the library professionals suffer with7.  Skill development is important for the library professionals in  the  emerging  information  age,  so  should  libraries  engage  in  exchanging the skilled human resources, which is technology  driven observed Lavagnino while interviewing the top library  professionals8.  
Integration  of  technology  to  provide  more  specialised  library services to the clientele has reduced the intermediary  role of library professionals, who were more or less acting as  a bridge between the information and its seeker. With the help  of technology, library professionals can play a more proactive  role  in  rendering  services  to  their  users  and  so  are  library  professionals seeking better job satisfaction in this ever and fast  changing technological era, which has offered better and new  learning opportunities to one and all9. The promise Information

Technology has shown in renewing the library profession is not  being taken alike by one and all, as some library professionals,  especially of those have got used to in conventional methods  of library services and practices are a bit wary to embrace the  technology fully and refect varied opinions about its use10.  
In a study, Kibert and Wanyama11 found that the library  professionals of the Margaret Thatcher Moi University, Kenya  were exceptionally happy to have an automated library. Poole  and  Debby 
12 
while  examining  the  library  professionals  of  the  Florida  Community  College  recommended  the  need  for  refecting  a  positive  attitude  towards  embracing  the  cutting  edge technology and so should be there rewards for employees  for better job satisfaction.  
In this technological age, no institution can afford to run in  the absence of technology, which has revolutionised the sphere  of human activity in many ways and so holds true of libraries.  However,  Singh  &  Krishna 
13 
in  their  study  found  that  the  libraries associated with the agricultural universities and other  agricultural  institutes  across  India  lack  IT  infrastructure  and  so do the professionals working in these libraries refect lower  levels of job satisfaction. The introduction of IT in the libraries  improves the job satisfaction among the employees, observed  Srivastava and Srivastava 
14 
 while studying the job satisfaction  among the library professionals working in the higher education  sector of the Rajasthan. Perception and attitude towards the use  of internet in the libraries varies considerably among the library  professionals  depending  upon  the  post,  the  position,  gender  and the age of an employee at the work place 
15. 
In a similar  study Vinayagmoorthy 
16, et al. stressed on the need to train the  professionals in the areas of digitisation and the preservation  of digital resources. However, Lim 
17 
 considers the limitation  in putting in place the technological infrastructure among the  developing countries as an impediment in the job satisfaction  of library professionals.  
In a study to assess the job satisfaction among the library  professionals  of  Maharashtra  and  Karnataka,  Kacherki 
18 found  that  apart  from  pay  and  promotions,  IT  is  a  modern  day  job  motivator  among  library  professionals.  Walmiki  &  Ramakrishnegowda 
19 
stressed on the need to develop the ICT  infrastructure  in  the  University  libraries  across  India.  The  researchers  are  of  the  view  that  an  ICT  application  makes  the routine library work interesting, hence serves as a reason  for  the  better  job  satisfaction.  However,  Kumbhar 
20 
  pointed  out that lack of fnancial support and skilled manpower acts  as  an  impediment  in  raising  ICT  infrastructure  in  libraries  across  India.  While  studying  the  job  satisfaction  among  the  LIS professionals in India, Pandita 
21 
 found that more than 77  per  cent  library  professionals  in  India  want  to  change  their  present  employer  on  account  of  dissatisfaction  with  their  present  employers  and  so  is  the  application  of  information  technology  an  important  variable  of  job  satisfaction  among  LIS professionals 
22.  
Mathew 
23 
in his study observed a positive attitude among  library  professionals  towards  the  application  of  IT  in  the  Libraries to improve its services and activities, while as the  need is to promote the ICT skill among the library professionals  and  introducing  IT  curriculum  among  the  potential  library  professionals can help a great deal. Rahman

 pointed out that

putting in place the IT infrastructure and continuing education  is  imperative  for  the  better  job  satisfaction  and  improved  services and so should library professionals omit it show a more  proactive approach towards embracing the technology25. The  professionals have to always show a positive attitude towards  their  work  and  so  is  there  need  to  motivate  the  employees  towards the change which may be warranted.  
4. SCoPE And   RESEARCH  METH odoLoGY 
Although, the scope of the study is limited to the library  professionals  working  in  the  higher  education  sector  of  the  Jammu and Kashmir state, but given the nature of the library  profession, the fndings of the study can be easily generalised.  The state of Jammu and Kashmir is one of the 36 states and union  territories of the Union of India. The higher education sector of  the state is very vibrant, having nine universities (Seven state  universities, two central universities), one National Institute of  Technology, one Indian Institute of Technology and one Indian  Institute of Management Studies. There are over 100 government  degree colleges across the state and nearly 175 private colleges  and institutes which are contributing to the higher education  sector of the state. To undertake the present study, data were  collected from the library professionals working in the higher  education sector of the Jammu and Kashmir state, India, by  circulating a questionnaire among the respondents, specially  designed  for  the  purpose.  The  respondents  include,  library  professionals working in both government and private sector.  A pre-test of the questionnaire was conducted by circulating

it among the 20 respondents and after evaluating the replies,  necessary modifcations were undertaken with help of subject  experts. The responses were collected by using three different  methods, one by circulating the online link of the questionnaire  among the respondents through their email ids, through groups  and  social  networking  sites,  etc.  Secondly,  print  outs  of  the  questionnaires were sent by post to the respondents on their  offcial postal address and thirdly, the questionnaires were also  distributed in person and responses were generally collected on  the next day.  
5. LIMITATIonS 
By and large no such major limitation was faced during  the course of data collection and data analysis; however, given  the  poor  state  of  the  understaffed  private  and  government  higher  education  institutions,  mostly  being  run  without  a  full  time  librarian,  curtailed  the  expected  level  of  response   generation. 
6. RESuLTS 
In all 264 responses could be generated from the library  professionals  working  in  the  higher  education  sector  of  the  Jammu and Kashmir. The responses generated were tabulated in  the excel sheet and the computations like, addition, subtraction,  multiplications, drawing percentage etc., were performed by  using the MS excel formulas. Percentage at all the places has  been drawn up to one decimal place and has been rounded off  to the 100 per cent fgure.

Of the total 264 responses generated during the period of  study, 44.3 per cent are male respondents and 55.7 per cent are  female respondents, clearly refecting that the library profession  is a preferred choice of both the genders. The majority 37.5 per  cent respondents are in the age group of 26 yr to 35 yr, which  is followed by 36.7 per cent respondents in the age group of 36  yr to 45 yr of age. This clearly indicates that nearly 75 per cent  library professionals working in the higher education sector of  the Jammu & Kashmir are quite young, hence can be expected  of more result and service oriented in their outlook. Also, 5.3  per cent respondents are above 56 yr of age. In all a fair amount  of  respondent’s  representation  was  recorded  under  each  age  group of library professionals across the state, Table 1.  
In terms of work experience, the majority 24.6 per cent  respondents have 2 yr to 5 yr of work experience, followed  by  24.2  per  cent  respondents  having  6  yr  to  10  years  of  experience and 22 per cent respondents have 11 yr to 15 years  of work experience. While as 3.8 per cent respondents have  a  work  experience  less  than  1  year.  Of  the  total  responses  received,  45.8  per  cent  are  working  in  autonomous  bodies,  which include, universities and other institutions of national  importance,  IIT’s,  IIM,  IIIM,  NIT’s  etc.  43.2  per  cent  are  working in the government sector, these include, government  degree colleges, medical colleges, nursing colleges, etc., and  10  per  cent  respondents  are  working  in  the  private  sector,  which  includes  private  colleges  of  technical,  academic  and  professional nature.  
In terms of educational qualifcations, 67.4 per cent have  a Master’s degree in Library and Information Science (LIS),  9.8 per cent have a Bachelor’s degree in LIS and 7.6 per cent  have MPhill and Doctorate degrees in the LIS. In all, given the  biographical indices as tabulated in the Table 1, the respondents  represent a wholesome representation of the LIS professionals  working in different type of institutions across the state.

6.1  Professional  Specialisation  
While  seeking  the  reply  of  the  respondents  of  their  professional specialisation, the respondents were given freedom  to  choose  as  many  areas  as  they  specialise  in. Accordingly,  we  may  fnd  a  considerable  variation  in  the  total  number  of  respondents  and  total  responses  generated  against  each  individual  specialised  area. While  as,  the  overall  percentage  
78 
has been drawn from the actual number of respondents under  each category. The maximum, 50.4 per cent respondents have  replied that they specialised in the automation activities of the  libraries,  followed  by  48.9  per  cent  in  circulation  services,  47  per  cent  in  classifcation  and  cataloguing  and  46.6  per  cent in acquisition services. Needless to mention that library  automation is about the application of information technology  in  the  library  services  and  activities. given  the  respondents  specialisation,  it  is  evident  that  information  technology  is  one  of  the  thrust  areas  of  the  library  services  and  activities  and  no  library  professionals  in  the  modern  times  can  afford  to remain elusive of honing and developing the IT skills. At  the gender level a considerable difference can be observed in  the percentage of male and female library professionals who  specialise in the library automation. Compared to 59 per cent  male respondents, 43.5 per cent female library professionals  specialise in library automation. This signifes that male library  professionals are more inclined towards the library automation  activities than their female counterparts.

7.2  Means  of  Keeping  Track  with  Professional  
developments  
The respondents were asked, as how they keep abreast of  the latest developments in their chosen feld or the professional  area, and again the respondents were asked to choose as many  options as they fnd appropriate. Accordingly, the maximum  62.1  per  cent  respondents  have  replied  that  they  frequently  consult  library  web  pages,  followed  by  notifcation  and  circulars, 60.2 per cent and e-mails 53.4 per cent. Here again,  it can be emphatically said that information technology plays  a  very  vital  role  in  keeping  library  professionals  abreast  of  the  latest  developments  in  the  feld.  Be  it  by  consulting  the  library web pages or through e-mails. Nevertheless, the offcial  notifcation  and  other  circulars  are  also  these  days  being  circulated in the electronic format, be it born digital document  or digitised notifcation. No signifcant difference can be found  at the gender level in browsing the internet, etc., as compared  to 51 per cent female LIS professionals 56.4 per cent males  LIS professionals update themselves, though e-mails, while as  compared to 61.2 per cent females 63.2 per cent males follow  library web pages to track professional developments.

 In reply to the above question, 15.2 per cent respondents  have replied that they were always deputed by their institutional  administration to attend such PDP programmes, while as, 18.9  per  cent  replied  of  being  deputed  more  often  and  36.7  per  cent replied sometimes. Nearly one-fourth of the respondents,  viz.,  24.2  per  cent  replied  of  being  never  deputed  by  their  institutional administration to attend such programmes. At the  gender level a considerable difference can be observed among  both the male and female library professionals. Compared to  females, male library professionals appear quite open to attend  such PDP’s as, compared to 17.9 per cent male respondents,  12.9  per  cent  female  respondents  viewed  of  being  deputed  to  such  programmes  always,  while  as  compared  to  19.7  per  cent male respondents 27.9 per cent female respondents have  replied of never being deputed to such PDP’s.

However,  23.9  per  cent  respondents  believe  that there is no difference in the job satisfaction levels among  the  LIS  professionals  working  in  the  manual  environment  than those working in the IT based work environment. At the  gender  level,  compared  to  44.4  per  cent  male  respondents,  43.5 per cent female respondents uphold the statement, while  as compared to 22.2 per cent male respondents 25.2 per cent  females view nothing like this.   
8.   d ISCuSSIonS 
From the gender level response percentage, it is quite evident  that both male and females are equally interested in the library  profession, Since, nearly 75 per cent respondents are within the  age group of 45 years with, the majority 67.4 per cent having  masters degree in library and information science, refects that  the LIS professionals working in the higher education sector  of the Jammu & Kashmir are quite young and well qualifed,  who are generally expected to be quite comfortable with the  application of information technology in libraries, so is evident  from the responses, as 50.4 per cent respondents have replied  that they specialise in library automation. Besides, the library  services like circulation, classifcation and cataloguing etc., are  being handled in the automated form. The importance of the  application of IT in the libraries gets assessed from the fact that  62.1 per cent respondents have replied that they keep track of  the latest developments in their feld by frequently browsing the  library web pages, and 53.4 per cent use emails for the purpose.  given the fact it is always imperative that LIS professionals  should  be  exposed  to  the  latest  technological  environment  for  honing  their  technical  skills  at  regular  intervals  of  time.  Participation in workshops, faculty development programmes,  and refresher & orientation courses can signifcantly contribute  in  this  regard.  Besides,  attending  professional  congregations  like conferences and seminars helps a great deal in the capacity  building  of  an  individual.  Deputing  library  professionals  to  attend such programmes should always be on the priority list  of the institutional administration, which by and large is not  a  constraint  for  the  LIS  professionals  working  in  the  higher  education sector of the Jammu & Kashmir.  
Skill and training of a Library professional can bear fruit  only,  if  the  same  is  supplemented  with  the  necessary  basic  minimum  IT  infrastructure.  There  is  no  point  in  appointing  or  having  trained  and  skilled  manpower,  if  the  same  is  not  being provided the necessary infrastructure to put such skills  and training into practice. Still more, in this IT driven world  
80 
always make it sure to provide the minimum basic necessary  IT infrastructure to the libraries so as to add to their operating  effciency.  Still  more,  switching  over  IT  work  environment,  serves a sense of satisfaction to the working professionals in  its  own  way,  which  in  turn  contributes  signifcantly  to  their  overall job satisfaction and improves the contribution of LIS  professionals  in  the  academic  and  research  activities  of  an  institution.  
Needless to mention that subscription of online journals  and procurement of ebooks by the libraries has become the order  of the day and no library can afford to operate in the absence  of such resources. And in order to exploit and utilised all such  e-resources to their optimum, there is a need to have a sound  IT infrastructure in the libraries. Again, rendering satisfactory  services to library clientele gives a good reason to the working  professionals  to  feel  elated,  whereby  they  start  fnding  their  job more meaningful and purposive. So raising the necessary  IT infrastructure and its application in the libraries apart from  bettering  the  overall  library  services,  do  contributes  in  the  overall job satisfaction of the working library professionals.  
9. ConCLuSIonS 
As has become information and communication technology  an integral part of the modern day life and services so has become  the application of Information technology endemic in rendering  effective library services and undertaking other allied activities.  In the present times, as no institution can afford to survive in  the absence of the libraries, so cannot libraries afford to survive  in the absence of the application of Information Technology?  The application of Information Technology has maximised the  use of the library resources and services in its own way and  so  has  IT  turned  the  job  of  the  working  professionals  more  meaningful, interactive and fulflling.  
The  conventional  manual  methods  of  working  in  the  libraries were less interactive and more boring for being more  monotonous, lacking thrill and variation. Contrary to this fact,  application  of  information  technology  apart  from  widening  the  service  base  of  the  users  has  made  the  job  of  library  professionals more attractive, hence less boredom and more user  satisfaction. The increased work effciency, serves satisfaction  to the working professionals, which in turn improves the level  of job satisfaction among the working professionals.  
Library professionals’ still working in the manual work  environment  should  switch  over  to  the  automated  work  environment and so holds true of the Institutional administration,  which  in  turn  should  work  on  exposing  the  technophobic  library  professional’s  to  the  technological  environment  and  should turn them in to technophilic. The better service delivery  serves as a sense of satisfaction to an employee and application  of  IT  in  libraries  has  contributed  signifcantly  to  the  overall  job  satisfaction  of  library  professionals,  irrespective  of  the  gender, post, position or any other individual distinction of an  employee. Information technology has helped in giving more  meaning to the library profession and so do library professional  have started fnding their job more meaningful, purposive and  fulflling.
