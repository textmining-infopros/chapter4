Information and communication technology (ICT) is not an unalloyed advantage when talking about propagation  and expansion of scholarly knowledge. The same ICT which acts as an enabler to research in the comfort of one’s  study  and  preferred  environment  makes  the  researchers  with  weak  conscience  vulnerable  to  the  temptation  of  research misconduct. Surprisingly, the same technology acts as a sentinel, helping academe nail such transgressions  and withdrawing them or taking the contextual corrective recourse. Of late, there has been a substantial increase in  the invalidation and withdrawal of research articles based on invalid data and fndings. One analysed the retraction  notices of 249 annulled articles, indexed in Scopus, during the period, 2000-2017. The study has highlighted that  the majority of the retracted notices do not have explicit reasons for revoking the fndings of research articles. It  has stressed upon the immensely pivotal role of libraries in spreading awareness and sensitising researchers with  regard to adherence to norms, ethics and policies of scholarly communication.

Journals are primary carriers of novel fndings of research.  They bring out to the world the knowledge created by research  conducted  in  individual  departments  and  laboratories  across  the  globe.  The  published  research  acts  as  stepping  stone,  accessed and consulted by the present and future generations  of  researchers  to  develop,  evolve  and  further  build  upon  it  to synthesise and generate new ideas and research and most  signifcantly solutions to many challenges faced by the society.  Scholarly  journals  strive  hard  to  meticulously  propagate  scholarly  knowledge  to  society  by  employing  rigorous  process of selection, review, lengthy and stringent vetting of  research manuscripts before these are published. In the same  construction, these beget the authors the brownie points of the  much prised scholarly visibility, fame and increased infuence  in the academe. Undeniably that is all very well deserved and  righteous.  The  journals  demolish  the  geographical  barriers  and  silos  of  knowledge,  connecting  and  bringing  together  the  knowledge  seeking  researchers  and  intelligentsia  for  a  greater  cause  of  mankind.  This  meticulousness,  diligence  and  extensiveness  of  efforts  that  underlies  real  research  has  unparalleled  impact.  The  general  and  scholarly  public  have  high trust in the published research and authors are held in high  esteem. This is popularly known as credibility of science.  
Unfortunately, this trust is also breached and infringed by

the unscrupulous researchers who temptingly get sucked into the  vortex of research misconduct. It refers to the acts of omissions  and commissions, infraction of ethics, integrity, and norms of  scholarly communication, plagiarism, deliberate or inadvertent  use  of  falsifed  or  fabricated  data,  misreporting  research  or  selective reporting as per convenience/preference, data fraud.  In fact, transparency and openness of research implies that all  the null fndings and statistically signifcant fndings should be  made  available  to  the  readers.  But  in  reality,  only  statistical  fndings are reported and others are rarely published1. 
It is very pertinent to mention that plagiarism in higher  education  is  a  serious  issue  in  the  country.  UGC,  India  has  approved  the  draft  of  Promotion  of  Academic  Integrity  of  Plagiarism in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2018. The same will be notifed after approval of Ministry of Human  Resource Development. It clearly mentions that the similarity  of content in research beyond 10 per cent would invite penalty  for researchers and faculty members. The penalty for faculty  members may range from denial of rights to supervise students  at various levels, Masters, M. Phil and Ph.D. for two years to  suspension or dismissal from services2. 
Non-adherence to norms of research communication results  in  inhibited  growth  of  progressive  knowledge  and  impedes  development of refective thinking in students and researchers3.  Misconduct in research leads to dissipation of energy, time and  money of entire fraternity of research scholars. The scholarly  damage increases when erroneous study becomes the base and  reference  point  for  further  studies.  This  domino  effect  will

continue till someone notices erroneous study and publisher/ author issues notice of withdrawal of the same.  Whenever any  kind of infraction in research norms emerges, the editors and  authors minimise the damage by withdrawing tainted published  paper  immediately  and  this  process  of  withdrawal  is  known  as  retraction.  Sometimes  authors  may  self-decide  to  retract  their  articles  and  communicate  the  same  to  the  editors. The  Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) Code of Conduct for  editors (published in 2003) holds editors of journals responsible  for authenticity of information published in their journals. They  should  readily  publish  corrections,  clarifcations,  retraction  notices and apologies as per the need of the situation4. 
The  Paper  analyses  the  content  of  retraction  notices  of  retracted articles as indexed in Scopus. It is pertinent to mention  here  that  retracted  articles  are  listed  as  one  of  the  types  of  documents in Scopus. The study talks about published research  articles  which  have  been  retracted  since  2000.  It  spotlights  the issue of retraction together with the reasons which led to  annulment of the same. Also it sounds them of ways of steering  clear of such fumbling/lapses, either intentional or unwitting, as  it may cost them their scholarly aura and dilute the credibility  and effcacy of their works. 
2. LIteRAtuRe RevIew 
The number of retractions has gone up from 97 in 2006  to 664 in 2016. The Scientist magazine has reported ten main  retractions  of  2017.  It  also  refers  to  two  articles  written  by  Nobel prize winners in Science and Nature Chemistry in 2014  and  2016  respectively. The  Nobel  laureates  got  their  papers  withdrawn  because  their  laboratories  could  not  replicate  the  fndings which they reported in their research. Tumor Biology  journal revoked 107 papers in one go after it was learnt that the  review process had been compromised5. 
A former British surgeon and medical researcher published  an article in the reputed journal Lancet in 1998 which established  a link in Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine and a  new syndrome of autism and bowel disease”. Doctors across  the globe raised voice against compulsory MMR vaccination.   It  was  discovered  in  2012,  after  a  gap  of  14  year,  that  this  study was based on fabricated and false data consequently it  was retracted, but by then it had received many citations and  had  been  consulted  by  thousands  of  medical  doctors.  The  fraud research led to declining in vaccination of thousands of  children; it made innocent children vulnerable to diseases like  measles  and  mumps  and  created  distrust  among  the  general  public  against  immunisation6.  It  highlights  the  enormity  of  damage  which  can  be  caused  by  fraudulent  research.  The  research fndings in manipulated studies are fabricated, biased  and driven by ideas and feeling of authors of studies and may  be  harmful7.  Williams  &  Wager8 advised  editorial  boards  of  journals  to  be  cautious  in  differentiating  between  genuine  errors and misconducts; this study further cautioned journals  to be careful in dealing with research misconduct as a slight  mistake  on  the  part  of  the  journals  may  lead  to  permanent  damage to reputation and career of authors.  
Further damage can be stopped by immediate withdrawal  of  controversial  publication.  The  removal  of  controversial  published articles in subsequent issues is termed as retraction;  
306 
it  may  be  due  to  infringement  of  professional  ethical  code,  such  as  multiple  submissions,  bogus  claims  of  authorship,  plagiarism, and fraudulent use of data. The articles are being  rescinded  at  an  increasing  rate  across  all  the  subject  areas9.  A  retraction  notice  is  issued  by  the  editor  of  the  journal  to  alert the readers about an article which is no longer valid as  it violates professional research ethical code. Hence retraction  is treated as a correct measure to avoid further damage due to  erroneous publication10. The reasons stated behind retraction  in the notice may be honest errors, non-replication of research  fndings,  misconduct  etc.  Scopus  citation  index  has  fagged  249 publications as retracted since 2000.  The exact prevalence  plused of fawed and manipulated research is unknown, but it is  likely to be higher than the current rate of retraction.  Retraction  Watch  is  a  blog  which  keeps  track  of  retracted  articles  and  reports  about  them  on  web  link  http://retractionwatch.com/.  It has been observed that the higher the impact factor of the  journal, the more retractions are reported due to fraud11. The  journals like Cell, Lancet, PLOS ONE, Nature, New England  Journal of Science reported have high retraction rates12,13 have  reported  that  65  per  cent  of  the  top  200  scientifc  journals  have retraction policies, however there is lack of consistency  in  policies  and  practices  of  retraction.  Thus  the  corrective  measures of retraction of research articles differ with changes  in  retraction  policies  of  publishers. The  corrective  measures  are  also  infuenced  by  reasons  behind  retraction;  extent  of  scholarly and humanitarian damage; the policy of publishers,  consent of co-authors and legality involved in revocation. The  retraction process consists in linking of retraction notice with  the initially published article; explaining reasons for retraction,  however,  few  retraction  notices  fail  to  state  reasons  behind  withdrawals.  The notice further states the date of withdrawal  and  link  to  full  incorrect  version.  There  are  instances  when  the withdrawn paper is replaced by the correct version, while  some  publishers  retain  the  original  article  unchanged,  in  such  scenario  publishers  may  watermark  the  full-text  of  the  retracted  article  as  retracted;  while  HTML  version  may  be  removed. In rare cases, where legal reasons are involved, the  full text is deleted. The abstracting and citation databases also  highlight  retracted  articles. The Web  of  Science  (WOS)  has  “retracted publication” as a category of documents. Medline  also highlights retracted papers.   
The  anti-plagiarism  software  highlights  merely  where  the texts match with already published works, so this software  cannot replace human intelligence. Ultimately editorial teams  of journals have to take the fnal call and decide if contents  of  the  submission  are  plagiarsed  or  otherwise. Fanelli14   has  observed that retractions are rising not because of increasing  research misconduct but due to the reason that the researchers  have become more aware, educated and vigilant and raise voice  against  the  erroneous,  falsifed,  fabricated  and  misreported  research.  Baker15 endorsed  responsibility  of  libraries  in  promoting awareness about the retraction notices to minimise  the scholarly loss in future. 
Many governments across the globe extend incentives to  the researchers for publishing in international journals16. The  researchers are under pressure to publish as their grants and  promotions are linked to the number of research articles they

publish in high impact, international journals. So in a bid to  amass numbers, the basic norms of openness, reproducibility,  transparency,  which  the  researchers  are  strictly  supposed  to  adhere to, are relegated17 have advocated that the authorities  should provide incentives to researchers for practicing ethics  and integrity. The scholars should be awarded for publishing  proper  research  and  not  publishing  more  research17  have  observed  that  the  word  “retraction”  has  an  insinuation  of  pessimism  or  utter  dismissal,  as  it  refers  to  an  annulment  of research both for inadvertent as well as for the deliberate  misconduct. The researchers may want to withdraw their work  when they discover some errors which they committed, though  they had a clear conscience; while there may be instances where  researchers deliberately submit and publish fawed research and  withdraw under pressure. The use of other terms like “Voluntary  withdrawal” and “withdrawal for cause” may remove the deep  stigma associated with the term of “retraction”. 
Research  productivity  enhances  careers  and  bestows  accolades  and  esteem.  Research  fndings  are  supposed  to  extend the existing boundaries of knowledge and support and  promote  the  humankind,  be  it  food,  security,  harnessing  the  potential of natural resources, reducing the drudgery of the day- today mundane life, protection from environmental and natural  calamities.  Unfortunately,  this  is  not  always  true  because  of  wrong conduct of researchers, this lead to retraction. 
2.1   o bjectives  of  the  Study 
• To highlight retracted articles during 2000-2017, indexed  
in Scopus  
• To understand reasons behind retraction, with the help of  
content analysis of texts of retraction notices 
• To assess extent of scholarly damage caused by retracted  
articles by counting citations received by such articles  • To identify subjects which reported frequent retractions 
3. MethodoLogy 
This  is  an  exploratory  study  which  used  quantitative  as  well  as  qualitative  research  methodologies  to  meet  the  aforementioned objectives. The quantitative research approach  is  based  on  descriptive  statistical  techniques  to  understand  frequency  and  trends  in  retractions  across  disciplines  and  individual  journals  The  qualitative  research  is  applied  to  understand reasons behind retraction; it is based on analysis  of texts of retraction notices. The content analysis is based on  meaning of the notices rather on patterns of texts/phrases in  notices. 
Secondary data for the study was obtained from Scopus’s  abstracting and citation database of peer reviewed literature of  scholarly journals, books and conference volumes. Retracted  articles are listed as one of the types of documents in Scopus  database. The data for the study was downloaded in the second  half  of  January  2018.The  following  flters  were  set  up  for  retrieval of data for the study.

249  articles  were  retracted  from  161  unique  scholarly  journals  during  the  18-year  period,  2000-2017.  Trends  of  retraction are refected in Table 1 through number of articles  retracted annually. 
Journals  and  research  community  have  become  more  vigilant  against  research  misconduct  in  recent  years;  the  results show that over 50 per cent of article were retracted in  the last three years. Internet technology helps in easy access  and retrieval of information. At the same time, it offers counter  tools in parallel, which help in easy detection of plagiarsed and  copied text.

  4.1 Authorship  Pattern  and  Retraction  
Paper produced by research teams include names of each  member  of  the  team  as  authors  as  per  their  contributions  in  conducting  research  and  writing  the  research  fndings  in  the  form  of  publication.  The  Table  2  expresses  descriptive  association in numbers of authors with chances of withdrawal  of research paper.    
Table  2  has  proved  that  multi-authored  papers  are  retracted more than the single author papers. 94.8 per cent of  retraced  articles  were  multi-authored. The  experts18 analysed  19.9 million article and 2.1 million patent, reported that more  research  is  being  done  in  collaboration  in  different  felds  like Sciences and Engineering, Social Sciences, Arts and the  Humanities, unlike in the past, when solo authors dominated  the  scholarly  communication  landscape19   have  explained  authorship trends in bioinformatics discipline and reported that  9.8 per cent of articles are single authored and 90.2 per cent are  multi-authored. This may be rationale for very high retraction

of multi-authored papers.  
Many retraction notices mentioned that co-authors’ names  were used without seeking their permission. The researchers  must be aware that they must formally seek permission before  putting  their  colleagues’  names  as  co-authors.  Besides,  it  is  unethical to put others’ names as co authors, when such authors  have not contributed to the paper. The issues of ghost and gift  authorship  are  widespread  in  the  scholarly  communication  landscape. The  STEM  publishers  have  given  some  rules  for  authorship which are not uniform or consistently followed by

4.2  Journals  in  which  the Articles  were  Published 
There  were  160  unique  journals  which  retracted  249  articles.  Table  3  has  listed  fve  journals  with  the  highest  number  of  retracted  articles  along  with  their  Impact  Factors  in brackets. 
Table  4  refects  that  journals  with  high  number  of  retraction papers also have high Impact Factor. All the journals  with  high  retraction  rate  are  in  the  discipline  of  Biology,  Bio-medical  and  Nature  Sciences;  all  these  disciplines  are  closely associated and have great impact on human health and  humanity 
4.3 Number  of citations  Received  by  the Articles  
before  these  are withdrawn 
Citations indicate that the citing researchers have referred  the  cited  research  to  consult  and  build  up  their  work.  Each  citation to an article, with invalid fndings, adds to scholarly  damage, so the number of citations to articles, with erroneous  results, is an important parameter to estimate harm caused by  false or untrue research article before it is s withdrawn.   The  249  retracted  articles  received  4909  citations;  10  item  out  of  these  had  remarkably  high  2202  citations.  It  implies  that

retracted articles caused grave damage to scholarly world and  society  by  misleading  other  researchers  over  4909  research  studies. The exact extent of damage will be more as errors of  incorrect  research  articles  have  been  further  propagated  and  built upon by others who have referred these 4909 studies. 
4.4  Reasons  of  Retraction  
Contents  analysis  of  retraction  notice  was  done  to  understand  reasons  behind  retraction  of  article.  The  content  analysis  is  based  on  meaning  of  retraction  notice.    Reasons  for retraction are classifed into three categories i.e. a) Honest  error b) Plagiarism and c) ethical problems 
The  major  fndings  while  doing  content  analysis  of  retracted notices are as follows 
• The articles were either retracted by authors or editors in  
collaboration

Majority of the articles did not have explicit explanation  for retraction 
Few  articles  were  retracted  as  their  authors  had  used  inaccurate, fabricated clinical data, although authors did  not have ownership of data used in the articles. Authors  committed inadvertent error; in handling and using data There  were  journals  which  published  expression  of  concern  before  retracting  the  articles.  For  instance,  an  article  was  published  in  2000  in  Glia.  The  journal  published expression of concern to notify readers about  the  validity  of  data  and  this  was  being  investigated  by  national level committee on scientifc dishonesty. In 2017  the article was retracted as the committee found that there  were  discrepancies  in  the  type  and  number  of  animals  used  in  experiments  and  thus  the  fndings  of  the  study  were unreliable 
Similarly, Diabetes journal published an article in 2006  and issued expression of concern in 2015 to alert readers  about the reliability of data. The readers complained to  the  editor  of  the  journal  that  the  article  had  duplicate  and  manipulated  images.  The  main  author’s  institute  was  asked  to  investigate  the  matter  and  the  article  was  withdrawn in 2016. 
4.5  Subject categories  of  Retracted Articles 
The  study  analysed  whether  tendency  of  research  misconduct  differed  with  discipline.  Retracted  articles  are  classifed  discipline  wise  as  shown  in  Table  5.  Name  of  discipline of research paper is mentioned in the database of the  Scopus citation index.  
The maximum numbers of retraction of articles in the last  18 years were in Medicine, Health sciences, Orthopedics and  Oncology disciplines, 39.4 per cent of retracted articles were  these  discipline;  it  is  followed  by  retractions  in  Bioscience,  Pharmaceutical  sciences,  Biotechnology,  Biosciences  or  Neurobiology with 16.5 per cent of retracted articles were these  discipline.  All  these  disciplines  are  closely  associated  with  human health, so research misconduct in these disciplines lead  to deleterious permanent damages to humankind and society. 
4.6  Role  of  Libraries 
Libraries  in  collaboration  with  teachers  can  play  a  proactive  role  in  sensitising  researchers  about  academic  misconduct.  Libraries  should  hold  awareness/sensitisation  sessions on academic conduct, ethics and integrity in research,  the  concept  of  retraction  should  also  be  dwelt  upon.  The  retracted  articles  along  with  reasons  behind  withdrawals  should  be  highlighted  in  sensitisation  programme.  Libraries  should  educate  the  researchers  on  different  aspects  of  data  organisation,  management  and  storage  for  easy  access  and  retrieval  for  reliable  and  correct  data.  Best  practices  in  data  management practices should be documented and shared with  researchers.  Libraries should formulate rules and guidelines to  ensure compliance of ethics and norms in research, the policy  will also postulate procedure to identify and deal with research  misconduct.  Libraries  should  educate  the  researchers  on  different aspects of data organisation, management and storage  for easy access and retrieval for reliable and correct data. Best

practices in data management practices should be documented  and shared with researchers.  Libraries should formulate rules  and  guidelines  to  ensure  compliance  of  ethics  and  norms  in  research, the policy will also postulate procedure to identify  and deal with research misconduct. A culture of honesty and  transparency,  ethics  in  academic  and  research  environment  should be emphasised upon. 
Quality of research, not quantity, should be spotlighted,  emphasised  and  celebrated.  Besides  providing  guidance  and  training,  authorities  should  deploy  additional  measures  like  scrutiny  and  monitoring,  random  auditing  of  research  fndings. 
The teaching and research system needs to be overhauled.  Efforts  need  to  be  implemented  to  ensure  that  research  endeavors which are undertaken have impact and relevance for  the masses. 
Research  advances  scientifc  knowledge  and  impacts  humankind. But it should not be linked to promotions or career  advancement.  The  pressure  to  publish  compels  teachers  to  priorities research over their essential duties and responsibilities.  It may be a little impractical for teachers in medical colleges  and  institutions  as  they  are  supposed  to  teach  and  attend  to  the healthcare needs of the society. But when the professionals

are  under  pressure  to  publish,  they  have  no  qualms  and  get  published  in  predatory  journals.  Most  of  the  submissions  in  predatory  journals  are  from  India.  Robust  infrastructure,  with facilities for research along with supportive attitude and  congeniality  of  the  entire  academic  and  research  ecosystem  should be cultivated and extended. 
Besides,  there  should  be  two  types  of  categories  of  institutions like teaching universities and research universities  across all the streams, STEM, and SSH. On group should focus  on teaching and mentoring students while another should be  into conducting research and generating innovations and new  knowledge for application by the masses. 
Undeniably,  research  connects  the  dots  offered  by  contemporary  knowledge  and  analyses  the  same  to  create  more, thus helps to get the needed insights or way ahead. The  need of the hour is to have an arrangement of a twin set up.  One wing should create knowledge-this is the one with strong  research inclination and bandwidth working closely with the  one that works with the application of the generated knowledge  and executes the use of the same effectively. None of the two  can exist meaningfully in isolation. But equally crucial is the  role of experts or professionals who have exceptional expertise  in the application and execution part of the same. And these  experts  should  not  be  under  any  obligation  to  produce  a  required number of papers. Particularly felds like management,  marketing,  health  sciences,  agricultural  sciences,  renewable  energy, need both. 
Transparency  and  openness  of  research  implies  that  all  the null fndings and statistically signifcant fndings should be  made  available  to  the  readers.  But  in  reality,  only  statistical  fndings  are  reported  and  others  are  rarely  published1.  The  researchers  must  know  that  the  journals’  policies  emphasise  on providing open access to raw data on which the published  manuscripts are based upon; otherwise, they may risk getting  their articles retracted. The retraction notice given as Annexure  A  highlights  the  importance  of  saving  raw  date  even  after  publishing of article.  
The  researchers  should  be  taught  about  the  referencing  skills, as lack of these skills may result in their articles getting  retracted.

The study has analysed retraction notices of 249 article  indexed in Scopus, in the last 18 year, i.e. 2000 -2017. Health  sciences had maximum number of retractions. Journals have  increasingly become alert and sensitive to research misconduct  over  the  recent  years;  over  50  per  cent  of  retracted  articles  were  withdrawn  in  the  last  three  year.  The  availability  of  anti-plagiarism software coupled with the growing awareness  among  all  the  stakeholders  of  knowledge  has  contributed  to  the cause. The study also brings forth the lack of uniformity  in the retraction polices. Also it discusses the lack of clarity  on reasons quoted for retractions. The study noted that 95per  cent of retracted articles were multi-authored. One of the prime  reasons for withdrawal of paper was that one of the authors  reported that her/his name was included without seeking her/ his consent.  
Libraries  need  to  evangelise  among  the  researchers  the

rewards and prestige tagged with good research and caution  them against defame and fallout of non–adherence to norms or  ethics of scholarly communication.  Ensuring the credibility and  integrity of research activities and published literature is the  joint responsibility of all stakeholders-researchers, supervisors,  universities, funding bodies, editorial boards and publishers.  They  must  ensure  strict  compliance  to  the  relevant  policies  in this context. Research to be impactful has to safeguard the  sacrosanctity of the efforts that go into it.
