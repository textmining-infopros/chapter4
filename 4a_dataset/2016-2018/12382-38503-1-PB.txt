In this study, e-book research articles were reviewed which are published in various library science and non- library science journals. Identifes facets and signifcant results of e-book research. For this review, literature on  e-books published in English language, in 2016 was searched from various databases. The review fnds that the  focus of current research on e-books is on use. Themes such as e-book collection development and management;  search and discovery are also paid more attention to. Use of e-books by children is emerging as a prominent area  of e-book research. Results of most of the research on e-books are supportive to each other.  
 Keywords:  E-book use; E-book research; E-book collection development; E-book promotion

E-books  have  now  become  an  integral  part  of  library  collections.  E-books emerged little later than e-journals, but  they  have  soon  become  important  with  reference  to  library  budgets,  acquisition,  cataloguing,  services  and  usage.  Users  too  are  attracted  to  this  format  of  reading  material.  Many  stakeholders have interest in e-books from different points of  view. For example, the publishers and aggregators are interested  in e-books as a market commodity. The library professionals  are  keenly  interested  in  e-books  as  a  new  format  to  serve  users  and  an  another  opportunity  to  extend  their  services.  Researchers from many other subject areas too are interested in  this new communication format. At this background the author  is interested in knowing the current trends in e-book research  with  reference  to  topics  covered  and  major  fndings.  Earlier  author  did  review  the  research  on  e-book  published  during  20101.

This  research  intends  to  identify  the  facets  of  e-books  attended  to  by  the  research  published  during  2016.  It  also  intends  to  review  signifcant  results  and  their  supportive  or  contradictory  nature.  To  fulfll  these  aims  the  researcher  searched articles on e-books from LISA, Emerald Insight, Ebsco  and Google Scholar databases. ‘E-books OR ebooks’ statement  was used for searching literature. The query was restricted to  journal  articles  published  in  English  language  without  any  geographical limitation. The scope was delimited to January  to December 2016. All the above databases together retrieved  about 200 article. The retrieved items were deduplicated. In  the fnal reading few articles were sorted out as irrelevant and  fnally 78 article were identifed as relevant and are reviewed  here.

Different  users  use  e-books  for  different  purposes.  For  example,  Wang  and  Bai2   found  that  undergraduate  students  mainly  used  e-books  for  leisure  purpose.  Contrary  to  this  the  postgraduate  students  used  e-books  more  for  academic  purposes.  Similarly,  Carroll3,  et  al.   observed  that  overall  the  use  of  e-books  for  academic  purpose  has  increased  considerably. Koçak4, et al. also noticed that students preferred  e-books  while  studying.  Khan5, et  al.   and  Lewellen 
6,  
et  al. found  that  postgraduate  students  used  e-books  more  than  the undergraduates. Carroll3, et al.  has observed that general  reference  books  were  favoured  in  e-book  format  than  in  print. However, a study of the e-book usage by the academia  in  an  Indian  university  library  found  that  reference  e-books  were used very frequently (Nikam & Shivraj7). The different  national background must be responsible for these variations  in results. Inquiring about gender-wise differences in e-book  usage Khan5, et al.  found that compared with female students,  male  students  (in  Pakistan)  universities  used  e-books  more  frequently.  However,  Lewellen6,  et  al.   noticed  that  there  is  little difference by gender in use of e-books and printed books.  Investigating  about  the  correlation,  if  any,  between  length  of  reading  and  type  of  book  formats  preferred,  Goertzen  and  Bakkalbasi8   noticed  that  students  preferred  e-books  for  discontinuous reading; quick reference, whereas printed books  were preferred for continuous or prolonged reading.  
Rafq  and  Warraich9   studying  e-book  usage  pattern  of  undergraduate medical students in Pakistan noticed that most  students read e-books for academic purpose but still preferred  to  read  textbooks  in  print  format.  Carroll3, et  al. found  that  more students favoured literary works in printed format than  in e-book format. Contrary to this the general public favoured  fctions in e-book format especially for holidays and did not  favour  nonfctions  in  e-book  format10.  It  must  be  specially  noted  that  these  are  non-academic  users  whereas  Carroll’s

respondents were academic users. Asai11  studied format choice  for  popular  fction  in  Japan  and  found  that  compared  with  e-novels, e-comics are popular format.  
As far as use of e-books by students of specifc subject  is  concerned  Letchumanan  and  Muniandy12   found  that  the  mathematics postgraduate students mostly used mobile e-books  for study and to fnd information for their research activities.  Jou13, et  al. studied  use  of  e-books  and APP  and  found  that  e-books  were  used  by  engineering  students  in  classroom  setting  to  study  the  principles  of  mechanical  drawing  and  APP  was  used  for  creating  mechanical  drawings.  Librarians  often wish to know whether readers in a particular discipline  favour e-books or printed books. Knowlton14  developed a two- step model useful for this purpose. It could be noticed from  the above discussions that there is a fair amount of research  investigating  purposes  of  using  e-books.  However,  e-books  are not used to the desired magnitude in an Indian horticulture  and  forestry  university  (Bhat  and  Ganaie15).  When  enquired  whether  students  like  e-books  or  not  the  survey  of  Estelle16  found mixed reactions.

Quick  to  read  and  easy  to  manage  formats,  aesthetics,  ‘task-technology  ft’,  anywhere  anytime  availability,  user  friendliness, etc. are some of the common reasons for using  e-books. According  to  Dean17,  e-textbooks  are  used  because  they can engage students and help them succeed in their studies.  Ahmad  and  Brogan18   observed  that  academic  library  users  favoured e-books because of familiarity, usability, utility and  hedonic attributes. Being able to use even when the library is  closed and could be used simultaneously by many users are the  other reasons why users preferred e-books (Oliva19). E-books  are technological products. Okocha20  applied the unifed theory  of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model to test the  reasons for acceptance of e-books by university students. The  author found that performance expectancy, effort expectancy  and facilitating conditions infuenced student’s decision to use  e-books.  
Liaw and Huang’s21  investigation revealed that interactive  learning  environments,  acceptable  screen  size,  perceived  self-regulation,  and  self-effcacy  could  positively  infuence  usefulness  of e-books as  learning  tools.  Johnson22   found  a  correlation  between  use  of  e-books  and  ability  to  learn.  He  observed that education students who embrace e-booksperceive  themselves as abler learners than students who do not. E-books  enable to fnd micro contents from the text. This feature works  as  a  better  substitute  to  index  in  a  printed  reference  books.  Ogden23  has explained this with the help of electronic version of  an 80-year-old Hamilton and Hardy’s book entitled Industrial  Toxicology.  
5.  AwAREnEss And  usE   of  E-booKs  
For  increasing  use  it  is  important  that  users  are  aware  about the e-book titles available, various formats of e-books,  different  e-book  platforms,  their  scope,  search  features,  etc.  Sarjoon and Kabir24  studied the awareness and use of e-books  by the doctoral researchers at the Indian Institute of Science  Education and Research and found that almost all the users are  
aware of e-books and related technologies. However, Wendo  and  Mwanzu25   noticed  that  there  is  insuffcient  awareness  amongst the university students in Kenya about e-books. These  differences about awareness are from two different countries.  Awareness  and  use  of  e-books  should  ideally  be  positively  correlated.  However,  Okocha20   in  case  study  of  a  university  library  found  that  majority  of  the  students  were  aware  of  e-books, but many had used e-books only once. Wang and Bai2  too found that there was higher awareness but lower adoption  of general e-books by the university students in China.

Findability  and  accessibility  of  e-books  through  library  website  is  the  most  consistent  concerns  and  barriers  to  use  e-books3.  Goertzen  and  Bakkalbasi8   also  observed  that  availability and accessibility limited by platforms and licenses  cause frustrations in the use of e-books. Koçak4  as well as Rafq  and Warraich9  recognised that eye fatigue is a reason for not  preferring e-books. Nikam and Shivraj7  recognised that lack of  awareness amongst the users is the main hindrance in the usage  of  e-books.  Hobbs  and  Klare26   observed  that  the  features  in  e-books have not enhanced with the expected speed and due to  this student continue to encounter issues with interface designs  as well as the ability to easily control and manipulate their own  copies. Whatever may be the reasons for non-use or less use  of  e-books,  Rafq  and Warraich9   believed  that  librarians  can  play a vital role in minimising the barriers. Seth and Kelly27 observed that readers feel less connected to book when reading  e-books and therefore prefer printed books. They further stated  that these fndings align with ‘self-concept theory’ and indicate  that printed books are an extension of the self.

A good e-book collection development policy helps ‘to  acquire quality e-books at least cost with most suitable terms and  conditions and having effective access mechanism’. However,  to  be  effective,  an  e-book  collection  development  policy  needs to be revised regularly. Type and size of library need to  be  considered  while  revising  e-book  collection  development  policy. Lukes28, et al.   describe how two different approaches  were adopted for revising e-book collection development policy  by small college libraries.  In addition to policies, quantitative  and  qualitative  longitudinal  studies  of  students’  perceptions  help in collection development of e-books26. Similarly, Bozarth  and Zhong29  suggested that understanding of users’ preferences  about e-books does help in collection development. Tri-Agif30,  et  al.   recognised  that  satisfaction  and  perceived  ease  of  use  are the determinants of continuance intention of using e-books.  The authors suggest that these determinants could be used in  evaluating and selecting e-books before purchasing.  
Financial  crunch  is  a  perennial  problem  for  libraries.  Particularly, the academic libraries face the problem of rising  cost of printed textbooks. Ferguson31  identifed that acquisition  of  e-books  and  e-textbooks  is  a  benefcial  solution  to  the  problem  of  rising  cost  of  printed  textbooks.  According  to  Ferguson  sharing  of  e-books  across  departments  is  another  best  way  to  ensure  cost-effective  use  of  e-books.  Similarly,  the  University  of  Buffalo  libraries  administered  a  student-

based  e-textbook  pilot  programme  to  explore  a  sustainable  model32. Purchasing multiple e-books and cross departmental  collaboration  is  a  solution  suggested  by  Riha  and  LeMay33.  Carr34, et al.   observed that the rapidly increasing cost of course- adopted texts as well as the evolving models and platforms for  acquiring e-books offer libraries new opportunities to support  students’ learning needs.  
Pay-per-view,  patron-driven  acquisition  (PDA)  or  demand-driven acquisition (DDA), big deals, etc. are some of  the tried and tested e-book acquisition models. Each e-book  acquisition model has its own merits and demerits. Longley35 explains that the DDA model is more suitable to small academic  libraries. Kont36  too presented a study of successful adoption of  DDA model in a technology university library. DDA model’s  usefulness for academic library is also explained by Peters37.  Shapiro38  elaborated the merits of ‘Big Deal’ mode of e-book  acquisition.  Burke and Tumbleson39   discussed  about  various  e-book pricing models.   
Tovstiadi  and  Wiersma40   compared  multiple  e-book  platforms and identifed that usability, accessibility, continually  changing e-book market and platforms are major problems in  e-book collection development. In spite of number of benefts,  it  is  challenging  to  develop  an  e-book  consortial  model  suitable  to  all  the  stakeholders  i.e.  libraries,  suppliers  and  users. However, the Triangle Research Libraries Network and  Oxford University Press did develop a consortial model which  is  mutually  equitable  and  fnancially  sustainable41.  Closers  and mergers of e-book platforms adversely affect concerned  library’s  collection  development.  Hu42   describes  a  process  of fnding alternatives when a major e-book database ceases  services.    E-book  collections  in  libraries  must  be  evaluated  by using suitable criteria to assess strengths and weaknesses.  Bain43,  et  al.   explained  the  use  of  OCLC’s  World  Share  Collection Evaluation (WCE) system in evaluating science and  engineering e-book collection.   
Libraries  need  to  deselect  reading  material  due  to  various  reasons.  The  experience  of  replacing  the  deselected  printed  books  with  e-books  is  narrated  by  Oliva19.  Haugh44  and Lugg45  stated that libraries need both print and electronic  books  and  therefore,  there  should  be  proper  coordination  in  selection,  acquisition  and  management  of  both  the  types  of  books. Acquisition of e-books has attracted special attention  of e-book researchers. This has resulted in producing a large  amount  of  research  literature  over  the  years.  A  review  of  literature on e-book acquisition46  is an indication of the large  quantity and variety of literature on e-book acquisition. The  review specifcally identifed that the researchers have focused  on  non-traditional  purchasing  models  including  PDA  and  some libraries have preferred pay-per-view or evidence-based  selection and some have even preferred the Big Deal model.  In  general  e-book  holdings  in  libraries  are  growing  all  over  the world. However, with reference to specifc subject groups  there are variations. For example, Bhat and Ganaie47  report that  e-books are not yet fully incorporated into the North Indian  agricultural library’s collection.

The  variety  of  formats  of  e-books,  different  platforms  
164 
with varied search mechanism, and the constantly changing  nature  of  e-book  databases  does  create  confusion  for  users.  This  can  affect  the  use  e-books.  Garofalo48   believes  that  libraries can help users overcoming this problem by explaining  them the features of e-book formats and platforms. They can  do  this  by  educating  users  about  nature,  formats,  platforms  of e-books. Knowledge of users’ perceptions about e-books  helps librarians in designing user education programs26. It is  proven fact that display increase use of reading material. But  is it applicable to e-books? A study conducted by Tingle and  Tovstiadi49  revealed that only displays are not effective means  for increasing use of business e-books. The authors suggested  that  increased  visibility  along  with  other  features  may  increase the use of e-books. Experiments are constantly made  by  different  libraries  to  enhance  use  of  e-books.  However,  there is no guarantee of success.  For example, the Douglas  County Model in Western Colorado made available e-books  in an open source discovery layer based on VuFind but they  had  disappointing  experience.  Thomas  and  Noble50   report  how this situation was improved by moving the collection to  another platform named OverDrive. Chou51  suggest that when  students are given time and opportunities to read e-books, they  are likely to develop reading habits and strategies. Readers’  advisory (RA) service is getting momentum. Anderson52, et  al.   noticed  that  e-books  are  now  covered  in  RA  education.  Author  recommendation  system  is  one  of  the  components  of RA service. Zhang53, et al.  describe an e-book and author  recommender system developed by them. Both these articles  indicate  that  another  service  facet  is  getting  attached  with  e-books in libraries.

E-book  holdings  management  is  a  labour  intensive  and  time consuming task. However, effective holdings management  defnitely  increases  search  ability  of  e-books.  This  helps  in  increasing  the  use  of  e-books.  Zhang53,  et  al.   developed  a  special e-book and author organisation system called MLSOM  (i.e.  Multiplayer  Self-Organising  Map)  and  OCLC  launched  an automated holding management system. Using the OCLC’s  system  e-book’s  holding  information  can  be  populated  and  updated automatically within the World Cat knowledge base  without intervention from library staff54.     
E-books are more of common feature in today’s college,  university  and  research  libraries.  However,  they  are  not  so  common in public libraries. That is why public libraries are  highly interested in having better access to e-books in college  and university libraries55. ILL service will make use of such an  access.  ‘Fill rate’ is the major criteria to evaluate ILL service.  In  general,  it  is  noticed  that  compared  with  monographs  ILL fll rate is higher for journal articles. Sewell and Link56 investigated the possibility of increasing the ILL fll rate for  monographs.  The  authors  felt  that  creation  of  new  internal  workfows will help in implementing a speedier e-book ILL  system. With the growth of e-book collections, their lending is  also increasing, and so also the literature on this topic. Alipour- Hafezi  and  Khedmatgozar57   presented  systematic  review  of  literature on e-lending and identifed gaps in research on this  topic.

KUMBHAR : TRENDS IN  E- BOOK  R ESEARCH 
10.   s ouRcEs  foR  Acc EssIng  E-booKs  
Library  professionals  have  always  aimed  at  enhancing  search ability of reading material.  With the growth of e-book  collections  many  more  efforts  are  made  in  this  direction.  Jin58, et al.   transformed and enriched nearly 300,000 e-book  records in their OPAC from MARC records to Bibliographic  Framework (BIBFRAME) linked data resources. Incorporating  e-books into OPAC enables searching. Rai, Samar and Singh59 report an experiment carried out to incorporate e-books into  OPAC through LIBSyS-7. The authors asserted that users get  beneftted to a great extent in fnding desired e-book through this  improved version of OPAC. Similarly, the issues encountered  while handling vendor e-book records and best practices such  as  duplicate  records  control  in  Alma  (an  integrated  library  system)  is  described  by  Chen60, et  al.  Batch  processing  is  a  useful method of cataloguing e-books. Turner61  mentioned that  batch cataloguing or the editing and importing of large batches  of vendor-supplied records into the catalogue is increasingly  popular.  Issues  related  with  cataloguing  and  metadata  of  e-books received as legal deposits in a National Library and  solutions thereto are discussed by Derrot and Koskas62.  
Clustering and categorisation techniques are useful in  organising e-books on a given platform or in an OPAC. Wu  and  Hsieh63   investigated  user  experiences  with  clustering  and  categorisation  representations  of e-books in  a  public  library and found that users who have an explicit idea of  what they intend to find tend to prefer the categorisation  whereas the hedonic-oriented users tend to prefer clustering  interface. Lagace64  highlights NISO’s initiatives for enhancing  interoperability  among  parties  in  the e-book supply  chain.  As the number of e-books and their platforms are constantly  increasing,  it  is  becoming  more  and  more  diffcult  to  fnd  a  needed  e-book  and  or  specifc  content  from  e-books.  This  challenge of fnding needed content from e-books is effectively  elaborated by Kleeman65.  
11.  E-booKs And chIldREn    
About  fve  years  back  there  was  not  much  research  literature on use of e-books by children and other related facets1.  The  present  review  fnds  that  during  2016  a  considerable  research  has  been  published  on  use  of  e-books  by  children.  What  is  further  noticeable  is  that  the  research  literature  on  use of e-books by children covers all segments of children i.e.  infants, toddlers, young children, girls, boys etc.  
While  investigating  what  encourages  children  to  use  e-books Ciampa66  observed that curiosity, choice and challenge  are  the  three  intrinsic  motivations  that  encourage  grade  1  children  to  use  e-books.  Recognising  the  value  of  e-books  Ma and Wei67  observed that talking books or e-books provide  multi-sensory  stimuli  and  therefore  they  should  be  selected  for elementary school students. A study of frst to third grade  children of a summer reading programme found that the student  had  positive  attitude  regarding  the  use  of  e-books  and  they  preferred to read e-books than print68. The study specifcally  observed that use of nonfction e-books improves vocabulary  and  comprehension  and  also  provides  motivation  to  read.  Contrary to these positive sides, Reich69, et al.   studied effect  of tablet-based e-books on infants and toddlers and suggested  
that the use of such books should be restricted for infants and  toddlers  as  they  beneft  more  from  face-to-face  interactions  with  caregivers. The  authors  further  observed  that  enhanced  e-books with sounds, animations and games can distract young  children and reduce learning. We have to remember that these  suggestions  are  not  contrary  to  Ma  and Wei67   because  there  suggestions  are  about  elementary  school  students  whereas  Reich69, et al.  suggestions were about infants and toddlers.  
Believing that e-book designs could affect young children’s  learning Wang and yang70  carried out an experimental research  to  know  the  impact  of  e-book interactivity  design  on  the  learning of Chinese characters by fourth graders. The results  showed that, the group reading the e-book with the low level of  interactivity (pace-control only) performed signifcantly better  in Chinese character writing, attention, and satisfaction. Kao71,  et al.  also conducted experiment similar to Wang and  yang70 and with similar purposes in Taiwan and found opposite results.  Kao71, et al.  found that the students in the high interaction group  performed signifcantly better. These fnding indicate that more  such experiments are needed to arrive at generalisations.

Comparisons are made between printed and e-books since  the arrival of e-books. Gradually the formats of e-books are  increasing (e.g. pdf and fuid format) and improved devices for  reading  e-books  are  developed. This  has  provided  scope  for  comparing reading experiences of different formats of e-books.  For example, Zeng72, et al.  investigated the infuence of different  e-book formats and different e-book reading devices on graduate  students’ reading speed and comprehension. The authors found  that students read EPUB i.e. fuid format fles faster than PDF  fles.  Students’  average  reading  comprehension  was  higher  when reading EPUB fle on smart phones, dedicated e-book  reading devices and tablets, while most participants read PDF  fle faster on laptops.  Grover73  predicted that by virtue of their  responsive nature and higher text-to-nontext ratio e-books may  only iterate into simpler formats i.e. ‘future e-books will exist  almost entirely in web application format’.  
E-books can be read on desktops, laptops, smartphones,  as well as on dedicated e-book reading devices such as Kindle.  Availability  of  low-cost  mobile  reading  devices  has  created  favourable  condition  for  of  e-books  in  India74.  The  author  predicts that this will increase e-book acceptance rate in India.  Rowberry75   observed  that  the  Kindle  Popular  Highlights  database  contains  evidence  that  readers  are  re-appropriating  common  placing  i.e.  the  act  of  selecting  important  passages  from a text and recording them in a separate location for later  re-use,  while  reading  public  domain  titles  on  the  Kindle.  This  facility  will  help  in  increasing  e-book  usage  Tablets  and  mobile  devices  are  preferred  to  Kindle  because  these  are multipurpose devices3,14,18. Letchumanan and Muniandy76 through  their  systematic  review  observed  that  utilitarian,  cognitive  and  affective  factors  infuence  the  use  of  e-books  via handheld mobile devices. Shim77, et al.  studied dedicated  e-book reading devices and found that observability is the key  stimulator and complexity is the main bottleneck in adopting  dedicated e-book readers in Korea. The e-book reading devices

are still evolving and the best one is yet to come. Kubota78, et  al.  developed a prototype of a 434-ppi 5.9-in refective liquid  crystal display for use as an e-book reader. The authors claim  that they achieved eye-friendly refective liquid crystal display.  This could be partial solution to the eye fatigue, a barrier in  using e-books.  
13.   c onclusIons 
E-books  are  an  important  reading  material  and  as  such  are  of  interest  to  the  LIS  researchers.  Apart  from  library  professionals,  researchers  from  other  disciplines  such  as  technology,  education,  psychology,  engineering  media,  linguistics, commerce, management, publishing industry, etc.  too have interest in conducting research on e-books. E-book  research articles reviewed here are published in various journals  of library science, but most importantly they are published in  17  non-library  science  journals  also.  This  fact  confrm  that  e-books  are  truly  interdisciplinary  phenomenon.  From  the  literature reviewed here it could be concluded that e-books will  continue as an important communication medium. At the same  time, it has to be remembered that the printed book will also  retain its importance. Because as argued by the technologist  and media specialists Ballatore and Natale79, the history and  theory of media does not support the idea of disappearance of  printed book.
