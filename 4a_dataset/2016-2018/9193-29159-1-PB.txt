The main aim of the study is to develop library service quality assessment (LSQA) scale. Both qualitative  and quantitative procedures are used to confrm the reliability and validity of the LSQA scale. Exploratory factor  analysis (EFA) with varimax rotation is employed to indentify underlying dimensions of service quality of library.  The LSQA scale includes four dimensions: (a) library infrastructure/environment, (b) library collection, (c) library  services, and (d) library staff, which contains a total of 44 items. The reliability score Cronbach’s alpha for the scale  is found to be 0.969, which shows the excellent nature and a strong relationship of each item. The LSQA scale mean  and standard deviation is found to be 162.61 and 35.077, respectively. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin  value of sampling  adequacy of the scale is found to be 0.932. It is hoped that the LSQA scale could help library professionals and  scholars better understand users’ needs, to signifcantly improve and enhance the service quality of libraries.

        A  dramatic  change  is  occurring  in  the  scope  and  pace  of  technological  advances  that  are  contributing  substantially  to  a  fundamental  shift  in  library  and  information  products  and  services  thereby  affecting  the  role  and  responsibilities  of  professionals.  The  issues  before  library  and  information  professionals  are  now  to  cope  with  the  increasing  demand  for  information  from  a  variety  of  users  and  use  of  IT  to  redefine  services.  In  this  context,  quality  is  a  critical  factor  for  achieving  success, the concept of quality is not a new phenomenon  for  library  and  information  science  professionals  as  it  is  rooted  in  library  principles,  practices  and  activities.  Though  explicitly  not  stated,  Ranganathan’s  five  laws  of  library  science,  particularly,  the  fourth  law  (save  the  time  of  reader)  implies  the  importance  of  quality  in  library  services.  The  law  emphasizes  that  library  administration  be  simple  and  efficient  to  save  user’s  time.  Knowledgeable  staff  provides  seamless  access  to  information  regardless  of  format,  whether  the  user  is  in  the  library  or  at  a  remote  location1. 
     Historically, the quality of library has been measured  in  terms  its  use,  budget  and  manpower,  and  services.  In  recent  past,  this  concept  has  been  changed  towards  the  nature  of  service  rendered  by  the  librarians  and  not  merely  on  the  collection  and  size.  However,  in  the  present  day  context,  satisfying  the  needs  of  the  users  is  very  important  and  the  reliance  on  the  traditional  methods might not be sufficient to assess the quality and  effectiveness of the library from customer’s perspective.

So, it is imperative for libraries to seek means to ensure  that  their  services  meet  and  preferably  exceed  user’s  expectations.  A  continuing  program  of  assessment  is  essential  to  the  overall  development  of  a  meaningful  approach  to  meet  service  goals.  Hence,  it  is  imperative  for  the  upcoming  researchers  to  adopt  new  assessment  methods  to  ensure  qualitative  service. 
2. STATeMenT   of  The  ProbLeM 
Academic  libraries  of  Odisha  specially  engineering  college  libraries  are  facing  two  major  threats:  Digital/  electronic  environment  and  increasing  competition  for  quality  services.  They  must  improve  quality  of  their  services to survive. Most of traditional statistics gathered  by libraries lack relevance and don’t measure the library’s  performance in terms of satisfaction to customers. They  don’t  really  describe  performance  or  indicate  whether  service  quality  is  good,  indifferent  or  bad,  even  worse.  They  don’t  indicate  any  action  that  administration  or  any  team  could  or  should  take  to  improve  performance.  So,  to  understand  what  library  customers  expect  in  terms  of  service  quality  is  now  necessary  for  good  management.  It  is  in  this  context,  the  present  study  on  quality  assessment  of  library  services  in  Engineering  College  libraries  is  undertaken.

A  distinct  evolution  in  the  conceptualisation  and  measures of library service quality has been brought about  by many researchers. The traditional ways of examining

DJLIT, VOL.  36,  NO.  4, JuLy  2016 
academic library quality in terms of size of the library’s  holdings  and  counts  of  its  use  were  becoming  obsolete  compared  to  the  alternative  approaches  to  measure  quality  emerging  in  the  business  sector2.  user  studies,  including  user  information  seeking  behavior  or  needs  and  identification  of  user  information  search  process  models  were  being  rigorously  studied  but  those  did  not  address  the  ‘user-based’  criteria  for  measuring  service  quality.  In  libraries,  service  quality  applies  to  resources  (information content); organisation (service environment  and  resource  delivery)  and  service  delivered  by  staff3.  "Only  customers  judge  quality;  all  other  judgments  are  essentially  irrelevant".  Currently  the  service  quality  defines as "difference between customer's perceptions and  expectations" user is the best judge to assess the quality  of the services4.  In  defining  customer  service,  the  onus  is  on  library  to  deliver  service  based  on  demonstrated  customer  expectations. The  feedback  from  the  customer  provides the library with the necessary insight into how  well  the  vision  is  being  achieved,  in  terms  of  both  traditional  and  innovative  service  delivery.  
The  SERVQuAL  has  evolved  as  an  instrument  to  measure  service  quality  and  what  customers  value  as  important.  The  transferability  of  SERVQuAL,  into  the  academic library setting has been carried out by Nitecki2.  The fundamental objective of academic library is to link  users with the information sources they need, regardless of  the location or format of those sources. Making successful  linkages  requires  attention  to  not  only  the  identified  sources  but  also  the  experience  users  have  in  obtaining  them. Although, a lot of studies have been examined and  practiced SERVQuAL model as a framework in measuring  service  quality,  criticisms  have  been  revolved  around  the  interpretation  and  implementation  of  the  instrument  in  library  scenario.  Colleen  Cook,  Bruce  Thompson,  and  Fred  Heath  developed  a  modified  protocol  suitable  for  use  in  libraries,  called  LibQuAL+®  -Lib  (library)  and  QuAL  (quality).  Subsequently  the  Association  of  Research  Libraries  (ARL),  promoted  and  named  it  as  "LibQuAL+®," and used for non-profit use in improving  library  service  quality.  
A  number  of  research  studies  on  effectiveness,  efficiency, satisfaction of users, and usefulness of services  of libraries and information centers have been reported in  professional  literature.  Most  of  these  studies  are  aimed  to  assess  the  satisfaction  of  users  or  to  evaluate  the  quality of library and information services offered. They  used  either  existing  methods  for  the  study  and  research  or  devised  new  techniques  for  the  purpose.  
The Quadrant analysis has been used5,  which  plots  data about service attributes into four quadrants defined  by  two  dimensions:  one  reflects  the  importance  that  customers give service attributes, while the other indicates  the extent to which customers think a particular service  has the attributes. The attributes falling into Quadrant-1  are very important to the readers, and these users perceive  the  library  as  possessing  them  or  as  performing  well  in  
182 
their delivery. Attributes falling into Quadrant-2 are also  most  important  to  the  readers  but  are  not  perceived  as  being prominent features of a library service. The attributes  present  in  Quadrant-3  are  relatively  unimportant  to  the  readers, but readers associate those attributes with library  service.  Quadrant-4  includes  attributes  that  are  neither  valued by readers not performed well by the library. The  attributes  are  placed  in  the  respective  quadrants  as  per  the  scores  received  as  a  result  of  survey.    
Martensen & Gronhold6   describe in their study about the  user satisfaction and loyalty model which apply the structural  equation model which allows librarians to quantitatively  measure library users' perceived quality, satisfaction and  loyalty  with  a  library  as  well  as  the  degree  to  which  specific elements of a library's services, collections and  environment contribute to those perceptions. The model  contains  dimensions  like;  (a)  Electronic  resources,  (b)  printed  publications,  (c)  technical  facilities,  (d)  library  environment,  (e)  human  side  of  user  service,  (f)  user  value,  (g)  user  satisfaction,  and  (h)  user  loyalty.  The  Rodski Customer Satisfaction Survey has been used as a  performance and benchmarking tool by Australian university  libraries  since  1998.  The  Rodski  survey  methodology  gives  library  management  the  opportunity  to  measure  and  assess  any  gaps  between  client  expectations  and  service delivery7. Thirty-three variables are grouped into  the  following  areas:  (a)  communication,  (b)  facilities  and  equipment,  (c)  service  quality,  (d)  library  staff,  (e)  service  delivery,  and  (f)  virtual  library.  
A  specific  tool,  BiQual8,  is  designed  to  find  out  users’  opinions  on  service  quality  in  university  science  and technology libraries, and to inquire about the specific  information  needs  of  this  particular  group.  BiQual  is  structured  in  three  key  sections,  based  on  five  quality  service  dimensions  and  44  items.  Service  accessibility:  the library's capacity to provide access to its collections,  products  and  services  in  any  format.  Functionality:  this  dimension  measures  the  physical,  technological  and  environmental  conditions  that  guarantee  optimal  library  use,  such  as  via  remote  access.  Communications:  this  mechanism  measures  the  information  flow  between  the  library  and  its  users,  from  librarian  skills  to  channel  to  evaluate service quality. use: the aim of this dimension  is  to  identify  the  current  use  of  the  academic  library.  Value  added  services  and  trends:  an  extensive  range  of  new  products,  facilities  and  services  adapted  to  the  needs  and  expectations  of  science  and  technology  users  are  suggested  to  respondents.  
Somartana  &  Peiris9   used  a  modified  version  of  SERVQuAL to ascertain the service quality of Colombo  library  system.  The  users  were  asked  to  assess  the  actual  service  delivered  by  the  library;  to  establish  the  importance  of  the  service  to  them  as  users;  and,  to  identify to what extent the service met their expectations.  Exploratory  factor  analysis  with  Varimax  rotation  was  employed  to  identify  underlying  dimensions  of  service  quality  of  the  library.

DASH  & PADHI: LSQA SCALE: AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR MEASuRING uSERS’ PERCEPTIONS OF SERVICE QuALITy  IN LIBRARIES 
TOPSIS10  (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity  to  Ideal  Solution)  is  used  as  satisfaction  measurement  tool  to  measure  readers’  judgment  for  performance  of  the  library  as  an  information  resource  provider.  Library  is  a  typical  subject  of  information  service,  embodies  the characteristics of information service. The first-level  indexes  of  the  library  reader  satisfaction  evaluation  system  constructed  are:  (i)  venue,  (ii)  information  and  resources, (iii) service quality. Second-level index of the  library reader satisfaction evaluation system are: library  environment,  equipment,  layout,  literature,  network  resources  and  staffs'  knowledge,  instrumentation,  and  attitude.  
This paper is to establish a new AHP approach11 to  measuring  university  libraries  service.  The  method  of  evaluation  of  the  university  library  service  quality  is  based  on AHP  comprehensive  evaluation.  The  proposed  method  produces  a  mechanism  which  can  be  applied  to  evaluate  other  system  service  quality.  The  First  level  Index constitutes (a) Collection; (b) Service; (c) Facilities.  The Second Level Index constitutes (books stored, digital  resources) under collection; (open time per week, readers’  satisfaction)  under  service;  and  (area,  quantity  of  seat,  quantity  of  computer,  quantity  of  reading  room)  under  facilities.

The aim of this investigation is to design and develop  the  LSQA  scale  as  an  instrument  to  measure  users’  perception  towards  the  library  and  information  service  quality.  Measurement  instrument  that  are  collections  of  items  combined  into  a  composite  score,  and  intended  to  reveal  levels  of  theoretical  variables  not  readily  observable  by  direct  means,  are  often  referred  to  as  scales14.  From  the  literature  review  it  is  observed  that  various  service  quality  models  have  been  used  by  the  researchers  to  judge  the  service  quality  as  perceived  by  the  users. All  these  models,  in  other  words  know  as  scales  or  tools,  constitute  dimensions  and  under  each  dimension, items are accommodated. Keeping in view the  tools so far developed and status of engineering college  libraries  of  Odisha,  LSQA  scale  is  designed.  To  do  so  scale  development  steps  recommended  by  Churchil15 and Parasuraman4  are followed. Prior to development of  any  scale  the  first  and  foremost  step  is  to  understand  the  phenomenon  under  study,  which  is  well  established  through reviewing various literatures available. Stress has  been  given  to  steps  like  (a)  generation  of  item  pool  for  service  quality  measurement;  (b)  reduction  of  number  of  items  from  the  pool  of  items  so  generated  keeping  in  view  the  aim  of  survey,  and  (c)  identify  dimensions  of  service  quality  of  libraries.

The study revealed that in developing countries  all  the  service  indicators  evaluated  were  negatively  marked;  there  is  significant  difference  between  the  perceptions  and  expectations  of  library  users.  Factors  such as lack of modern facilities, poor funding, and weak  leadership  quality  were  negatively  affecting  the  quality  of  library  services.

and information service. Each article has been scrutinised  to extract dimensions or proposed sub-dimensions. Attention  is  also  paid  to  the  definitions  and  conceptualisations  of  the  constructs.  One  may  look  for  existing  instruments  that  can  be  modified  to  fit  the  themes  and  statements  found in the qualitative exploratory phase of the study17.  As  stated  earlier  from  among  the  literature  reviewed,  selected  literatures  have  been  chosen  for  this  purpose  of  item  pool  generation.  The  process  evolved  with  42  dimensions  of  library  service  quality  and  385  items  (service  quality  attributes).

Of  the  total  385  items,  these  cover  42  aspects  (dimensions). After thorough revision of the aspects and  their  respective  items,  two  main  issues  are  observed:  (a)  use  of  similar  terms  but  different  meaning;  (b)  use  of  different  terms  to  refer  to  the  same  meaning.   These  occurrences  are  unavoidable  as  each  researcher’s

interpretation  of  indicators  may  differ  based  on  type  of  service14. One may look for existing instruments that can  be  modified  to  fit  the  themes  and  statements  found  in  the  qualitative  exploratory  phase  of  the  study17.  In  this  
initial  scale,  not  to  generalise  the  findings  to  a  broader  population. 
The questionnaire contained 2 sections. Section – A:  
includes demographic information about the respondents  study  some  existing  scales  (SERVQUAL,  LibQUAL,  
such  as:  name  of  the  institute,  gender,  status  (student  
etc.),  have  been  referred  to  when  wording  the  items.  The  preliminary  scale  had  44  items  representing  all  dimensions. Steps taken to get 44 items from the whole  385  items  are  thorough  observation  of  the  essence  of  
or  faculty),  frequency  of  visiting  library.  Section  –  B:  includes 44 items on library service quality aspect derived  from  the  previous  steps. The  variables  in  this  study  are  
focus groups, as recommended by Moore & Benbasat18.  Resulting  44-items  transformed  into  questionnaire  and  used  to  collect  data  for  the  first  stage  of  purification.  This  stage  is  mainly  serving  the  confirmation  purpose  of  newly  developed  scales’  psychometric  properties.  A  five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)  to  5  (strongly  agree)  was  used.  
measured using a 5 point Likert-type statement anchored  the items and subsequent discussion with the experts and  
by  1  (strongly  disagree),  2  (disagree),  3  (neutral),  4  
5.3  Identification  of dimensions  of  Service  Quality 
This phase of the study is to examine the dimensionality  of the measures or scale. A survey is conducted to collect  data  to  identify  the  primary  underlying  dimensions  for  service quality and establishing the reliability and validity  of the scale. The questionnaire has been designed by using  the 44 items formulated. The aim is to have respondents’  assertion which items are important to them in assessing  library and information service quality. In sequencing the  items,  due  consideration  is  given  to  keep  respondents  focused  on  a  particular  area  of  service.  
6. SAMPLIng And dATA coLLecTIon 
There is no absolute rule for the number of sample  for scale purification. According to Churchill19  the sample  size for factor analysis should between 200 - 500. At least  five  times  as  many  observations  as  there  are  variables  to  analyse,  so  at  least  220  (5  x  44  items)  subjects  are  required20.  The  samples  of  the  survey  consist  of  350  users  of  selected  35  Engineering  College  Libraries  in  Odisha,  covering  Faculty  &  Students  (PG  and  uG)  of  the  sampled  colleges.  Web  survey  has  been  undertaken  for  pilot  survey.  The  questionnaire  is  developed  using  Google  Docs  and  the  link  so  generated  was  e-mailed  to  350  library  users.  Purposive  sampling  has  been  used  because the main aim is to judge library service quality  and the respondents who are regular users of the library  can better say about the positives and negatives of library  services.  The  primary  goal  at  this  stage  is  to  test  the

(agree), 5 (strongly agree) and NA (Not Applicable). This  is  to  maintain  consistency  in  scale  measurement  and  to  allow  for  correlations  and  factor  analysis21.    
6.1 response rate 
Of the total of 350 questionnaire distributed among  library users, 270 (77 %) responses are received.  Some  of  the  responses  are  removed  based  on  the  criteria:  (a)  where  all  44  items  received  either  all  ‘1’  or  ‘5’  (total–  30);  (b)  more  than  50    %  missing  data  (total–19).  So,  final data sets used for further analysis are: 270–(30+19)  =  221  (82  %).  A  large  percentage  of  the  respondents  belong  to  student  category  which  counts  178  (81  %)  whereas faculty response is 43 (19 %). From the students  categories  62  (35  %)  were  PG  students  and  116  (65%)  were  uG  students.  From  among  the  respondents  154  (70  %)  are  Male  and  67  (30  %)  are  Female. 
6.2  Library visit  
Frequent visitors are always asset to library. users’  mode  of  visit  to  the  library  is  tabulated  in  Table  1.  It  is  observed  that  100  (45.2  %)  respondents  are  visiting  library frequently (two or more visits per week) followed  by occasionally (a few times a month) visitors which is  69 (31.2 %), 30 (13.6 %) respondents visit very frequently  (daily)  and  19  (8.6  %)  respondents  visit  rarely  (a  few  times a semester). Library visit by Faculty is highest in  the category ‘Occasionally (A few times a month)’. Mode  of  visit  to  library  by  PG  and uG  students  is  highest  in  the category ‘Frequently (two or more visits per week)’  which  is  36  (58.1  %)  and  48  (41.4  %)  respectively.  
6.3  Mean  Score  of  Items 
The mean score and standard deviations of items are  analysed.  The  mean  score  range  varies  from  2.94-4.14  and  Standard  Deviation  range  varies  from  1.04-1.45.  Highest  84.1  %  of  items  are  having  mean  score  >=3

evident  that  all  the  items  appear  to  be  well  fit  to  the  scale  and  will  not  be  omitted  from  the  scale. 
6.4.2  Validity  Testing  of  Scale 
Validity is defined as the extent to which the instrument  measures  what  it  purposes  to  measure.  Assessment  instruments  must  be  both  reliable  and  valid  for  study  results  to  be  credible.  Validity  in  research  refers  to  how  accurately  a  study  answers  the  study  question  or  
the  interrelationships  among  variables  and  to  test  for  the  strength  of  the  study  conclusions.  The  process  of  reliability  and  validity  of  the  final  scale.  Based  on  validating  an  instrument  varies  depending  upon  what  
Churchill5  and DeVellis 
14, an initial reliability analysis was  conducted  on  the  44  items  generated.  For  the  statistical  data  elaboration  and  check  the  scale  factorial  structure  SPSS  17.0  edition  is  used.  
6.4.1  Reliability Analysis  of  Scale 
Reliability refers to whether an assessment instrument  gives  the  same  results  each  time  it  is  used  in  the  same  setting  with  the  same  type  of  subjects.  Reliability  is  a  part of the assessment of validity. DeVellis14  recommends  high inter-correlation among items in a scale. The higher  the correlations among items, the higher are the individual  item  reliabilities,  meaning  increased  reliability  of  the  scale.  One  of  the  most  important  indicators  of  a  scale’s  quality  is  the  reliability  coefficient,  alpha  (Cronbach’s  Alpha) Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient normally  ranges  between  0  and  1.  However,  there  is  actually  no  lower limit to the coefficient. The closer Cronbach’s alpha  coefficient  is  to  1.0  the  greater  the  internal  consistency  of the items in the scale. DeVellis14  provide the following  rules of thumb: “- >0.9 – Excellent; - >0.8 – Good; - >  0.7 – Acceptable; - >0.6 – Questionable; - >0.5 – Poor;  and  -<0.5  – unacceptable”  (Table  3).

aspect(s) of validity are being assessed. The dimensionality  assumptions  about  the  measurement  of  the  construct(s)  composing the assessment have been validated by using  methods  like  exploratory  factor  analysis  (EFA)  using  principal  component  analysis  (PCA). 
6.4.2.1  Exploratory  Factor Analysis  (EFA) 
Exploratory  factor  analysis  (EFA)  is  used  to  gather  information about (explore) the interrelationships among  a  set  of  variable22.  The  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  technique  is  used  in  reducing  a  large  number  of  variables  to  a  smaller  number  of  components  and  also  as an initial step to reveal maximum number and nature  of factors.23 The  extraction  method  has  been  carried  out  without  any  restriction  on  the  number  of  factors  to  be  extracted. 
Pallant22   suggested  three  steps  in  conducting  factor  analysis,    a  set  of  reliable  items  for  web-based  service   quality  measure  were  identified. The  three  steps  are: (i)     Assessment  of  the  suitability  of  the  data  for  
          factor  analysis 
(ii)    Factor  extraction 
(iii)  Factor  rotation  and  interpretation 
To  identify  the  naturally  occurring  dimensions  of  service  quality,  all  44  items  are  placed  into  an  exploratory  principal  components  analysis.  This  approach is recommended in the literature as a means of  identifying actual, rather than perceived factor groupings24.

Table  4  scale  statistics  gives  the  scores  that  are  related  to  the  scale’s  entirety,  which  presents  a  mean  of  the  class  of  162.61  and  standard  deviation  of  the  class  of  35.077.

As  per  KMO  measure,  a  measure  of  >  0.9  is  marvelous,  >  0.8  is  meritorious,  >  0.7  is  middling, > 0.6 is mediocre, > 0.5 is miserable and < 0.5  is  unacceptable.  In  the  present  study  it  is  0.932  which  shows  the  adequacy  rate  is  marvelous  (http://statistics.

the seven dimensions revolved around four main areas such  as:  (a)  library  as  place,  equipment  &  environment,  (b)  library collection/resources, (c) library staff & (d) library  services.  So,  four  higher  order  factors  were  proposed.

DASH  & PADHI: LSQA SCALE: AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR MEASuRING uSERS’ PERCEPTIONS OF SERVICE QuALITy  IN LIBRARIES 
6.5 Proposed  Measurement  Model  for  Library  and  
Information  Service  Quality 
The proposed library service quality assessment (LSQA)  tool (Appendix-D) constitutes 4 dimension of library and  information service quality and the 44 items are grouped  under  these  dimensions.  Based  on  the  4  dimensions  of  core  dimension  of  LSQA,  44  items  are  arranged  under  respective  sub-dimension  like  Library  infrastructure/  Environment- location, facilities, equipments & security;  Library  collection-types  (books,  periodicals,  non-book  materials,etc),  currency,  nature  (print  or  electronic);  Library  staff-  knowledge,  behavior,  communication,  appearance and library service—convenience & IT support  (Fig.  2).    
figure 2.  LSQA model. 
7. concLUSIonS 
The fundamental social function of the library is to  serve. The goal of the library is to provide excellent service  to  the  readers.  The  job  onus  is  to  understand  and  meet  the requirements of readers, showing professionalism for  promoting library service, exploring ICT and developing  rich service contents to meet the requirements of different  readers, adopting the strategy of service to promote and  build high-quality service environment. The first principle  of librarianship is to manage information resources in ways  that  will  serve  users,  which  incorporates  Ranganathan’s  five  laws  and  allows  users  who  seek  certain  type  of  material or information within certain parameters. Academic  librarianship faces challenges, problems and opportunities  to satisfy users. Quantifiable data obtained from any tool  is not an end in itself. Library staff should discuss user  perceptions  and  expectations,  using  their  experience  to  interpret service quality data and suggest how perceived  shortfalls  could  be  addressed.  The  proposed  LSQA  tool  would definitely help in this regard. This can be used by  the  library  professional  to  judge  the  quality  of  service  provided to the users as per their perceptions in different  library  environment.
