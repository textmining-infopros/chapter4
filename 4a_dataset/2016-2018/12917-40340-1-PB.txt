The  published  articles  in  leading  Indian  LIS  journals  during  2012-2017  have  been  mapped  to  depict  the  authorship pattern and collaboration trend in LIS domain of India. The study assessed the collaborative authorship  trend on using different parameters like journal wise pattern, year wise collaboration, co-authorship index, ranked list  of most productive authors and the level of collaboration. The Lotka’s law on author productivity has also been tested  to confrm the applicability of the law to the present data set. It is found that two-authored papers are predominant  (48%) in LIS publications and the collaborated articles of multi-authorships received greater average citations.  Besides, in Indian LIS discipline, maximum collaboration occurs in intra-institutional level and inter-institutions  within state level. Therefore, it is recommended that the LIS schools across the country should also consider inter- departmental collaboration to produce more quality works on emerging and innovative research areas.

1.  InTroduCTIon 
Collaboration  indicates  co-authorship,  the  formal  acknowledgement  of  joint  contribution1.  Collaboration  exists  from  the  beginning  of  history  of  science.  But,  since  last few decades it gets momentum in various disciplines of  science and technology. Participating in collaborations is the  increasing popular strategies for organisations/ individuals to  share resources, ideas and expertise. It is also an opportunity  to enhance the capability, to be more productive and to output  more quality works. However, the extent of collaboration and  their growth pattern varied from one discipline to another, one  branch  to  another  branch  of  the  same  subject  and  from  one  country to another country2. In recent days, it has also become  common practice that many specialists from different disciplines  are working together for an interdisciplinary project.  
Bibliometric  is  an  application  of  statistical  methods  to  evaluate  a  particular  discipline,  publication  pattern  and  characteristics. The present study is an attempt to quantify the  authorship pattern and trend in Library and Information Science  (LIS) literature by assessing the leading journals literature.  
2.    LIT erATure revIew 
The  review  of  literature  summarises  and  highlights  the  literature on authorship pattern, collaboration and the Lotka’s  law of author productivity. The fndings are as follows.  
Garg  and  Padhi2   analysed  3174  papers  published  in  Laser  Science  and  Technology  discipline  and  revealed  that  the  average  value  of  collaborative  coeffcient  is  towards

collaborative research pattern. The co-authorship index (CAI)  also applied by calculating proportional output of single, two,  multi and mega-authored papers for different nations and for  different sub-specialties of laser science and technology. 
Mondal,  Kanamadi  and  Das3   evaluated  the  papers  of  Indian authors published in foreign LIS journals during 2006- 2015 and depicted that two authored papers share maximum  articles (41.45 %). The University of Delhi shared maximum  contributions and Library Philosophy and Practice  has been  found as the most preferred foreign journals for communication  of research results.  
In  their  study,  Jain  and  Kumar4   measured  the  research  productivity  of  Indian  scientists  to  world  Soybean  research  during 1989-2008. India ranked 2nd  position in world research  publication and the authorship pattern showed the trend towards  joint authorship contributions. The Lotka’s law has been found  applicable to the present data set.  
In  another  study,  Elango  and  Rajendran5   assessed  the  authorship  pattern  and  collaboration  in  Marine  Sciences  discipline  and  identifed  that  the  highest  number  of  papers  contributed  by  two  author  and  by  inter-institutional  level  of  collaboration.  The  author  productivity  also  followed  the  Lotka’s law.  
Biradar and Tadasad6  identifed the pattern of authorship  and collaboration in Economics discipline during 2000-2014  by using collaborative index (avg. value of 2.14), degree of  collaboration (avg. value of 0.58) and collaborative coeffcient  (avg. value of 0.37). Majority of the papers were found to be  single  authored  but  overall  collaborative  research  trend  had  been seen.

MONDAL  &  JANA: COLLABORATIVE AUTHORSHIP TREND IN LEADING INDIAN LIS JOURNALS 
Suresh Kumar7  examined LIS publications and Naqvi and  Fatima8  analysed international business literature to study the  applicability  of  Lotka’s  law  to  author  productivity.  Further,  Kolmogorov –Smirnov goodness of ft test (K-S Test) and Chi  square test also tested to compare and confrm the dataset. In  both the cases, Lotka’s law confrmed the author productivity  distribution.   
Aswathy and Gopikuttan9  assessed the author productivity  in the publication of three University in Kerala during 2005- 2009 and Pillai Sudhier10  evaluated the authorship distribution  in physics literature. In both the study, Lotka’s inverse square  law has been applied using Pao’s method and the data set was  tested by K-S goodness-of-ft-test. But, the Lotka’ generalised  law is not applicable to these study.  
3.    o bJeCTIveS 
The study assesses the trend and impact of collaboration  pattern in Indian LIS discipline. The main objectives are to: • Illustrate  the  journal  wise  authorship  trend  and  
collaboration pattern 
• Find out year wise collaboration trend 
• Depict co-authorship index by year 
• Reveal most productive authors 
• Test  the  applicability  of  the  Lotka’s  law  on  author  
productivity distribution and   
• Examine the level of collaboration between authors.  
4.  SCope And meThodoLogy 
The  present  bibliometric  study  is  restricted  to  research  ‘article’ publications of three leading Indian LIS journals11 titled ‘Annals of Library and Information Studies’ (ALIS),  ‘DESIDOC Journal of Library & Information Technology’ (DJLIT) and ‘SRELS Journal of Information Management’ (SRELS) during 2012-2017. These promising journals have  long traditional history of scholarly publications in Indian  LIS discipline and have completed the volumes of 64, 37  and 54 respectively in the year 2017.   
Total 900 article published in 96 issue of these journals  have been taken into consideration for the study and retrieved  
from the archive of the respective journals website12,13,14. Then  the  bibliographical  details  have  been  collected  and  saved  to  MS-Excel  fle.  The  data  are  then  analysed  and  presented  in  tabular  and  graphical  format  for  interpretation.  Further,  the  Google  Scholar  online  database  (www.scholar.google.co.in)  has  also  been  consulted  during  February,  2018  to  get  the  citation data of the articles. 
5.    dATA AnALySIS And InTerpreTATIon 
The authors analysed and interpreted the bibliographical  details of select articles in the following sections on the basis  of different parameters.  
5.1 Journal  wise distribution  of Authorship  
pattern  
Table  1  illustrates  the  journal  wise  distribution  of  authorship  trend  and  its  citation  impact.    During  the  study  period, the three Indian LIS journals publish total 900 articles  which cited 1962 time at an average citation of 2.18. Out of  total articles, maximum 432 articles (48 %) are  written by two- authored, followed by 304 single-authored articles (33.77 %)  and 126 three-authored article (14 %). Only 13 articles (1.44  %) are written by fve or more author. Further, the 346 DJLIT  articles received maximum average citation of 3.254 whereas  the SRELS articles i.e. 353 received minimum average citation  of 0.835. Further, it is also seen that the collaborated articles  of two, three and four authorship attract more average citations  than single authored articles as shown in Fig. 1.

5.2 Journal  wise distribution  of  Collaboration  
Trend  
Table  2  reveals  the  journal  wise  distribution  of  collaboration  trend.  For  this  purpose,  the  authors  test  the  Collaborative  Index  (CI)  by Lawani15   and  the  collaborative  coeffcient (CC) by Ajiferuke15, et al. The average Collaborative  Index (CI) and the Collaborative Coeffcient (CC) for total 900  article  is  1.902  and  0.366  respectively  which  indicates  the  dominance  of  collaborative  authorship  in  LIS  publications.  Out of three LIS journals, maximum collaboration trend has  been  seen  in  the  publications  of  DJLIT  journal  followed  by  ALIS and SRELS.  
The mathematical formula for calculation of collaboration  tools are mentioned as follows15. 
2.021 and the CC also varies from 0.346 to 0.404. In both the  cases, the maximum collaboration trend has been seen in the  year 2014 whereas the minimum in the year 2013.  However,  slightly fuctuating trend has been observed in the collaboration  trend of Indian LIS publications by years.   
5.4 Co-Authorship  Index 
The  co-authorship  index  (CAI)  can  be  measured  by  calculating  proportional  output  of  single,  two,  multi  and  mega-authored  papers  for  different  nations.  The  following  mathematical  formula  of  Garg  and  Padhi2   has  been  used  to  determine the co-authorship pattern.  
CAI = {(Nij / Nio  ) /  (Noj  /  Noo  )} × 100 
Nij  : number of papers having j authors in block i 
Nio  : Total output of block i 
Noj  : number of papers having j authors for all blocks Noo  : total number of papers for all authors and all blocks j  = 1, 2, 3, 4, ≥5. 
CAI  =  100  implies  that  co-authorship  in  a  particular  block  for  a  particular  type  of  authorship  corresponds  to  the  world  average,  CAI  >  100  refects  higher  than  average  co- authorship effort and CAI < 100 indicates lower than average  co-authorship effort in a particular block for a particular type

• C=  895. 
Now,  putting  the  value  of  second  row  (i.e.  X=2;  Y=142; C=895)  in  Eqn.  1,  the  following  can  be  found. 
2n.  142=  895 
•  2n   =  895/  142 •   n log   2=  log   6.30 •   n   (0.301)=  0.799 •   n   =  0.799/  0.301 •   n   =  2.654 
Using the value of C=895 and n  = 2.654 in the Eqn.  
1, the expected values are calculated and presented in  
the Table 7.  
In the present study, total 1144 author contribute  
900  article  in  three  Indian  LIS  publications  during  
the  period  of  2012  to  2017.  There  are  895  authors  
(78.23 %) contributing one article, 142 author (12.41  
%)  contributing  two  article,  49  author  (4.28  %)  
contributing three articles and so on. To calculate the  
value of n, data from observed authors is used and is  
found to be 2.654 i.e., n=2.654. It is clear from Table  
6  that  the  observed  and  expected  authors  are  nearly  
same.  Pao  recommended10 to  use  the  Kolmogorov- 
Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-ft test for confrmation of  the applicability of Lotka’s law in the present data set.     
5.6.1  The  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  (K-S)  One  
Sample  Test 
  The  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  (K-S)  goodness-of-ft  test  was used to confrm the applicability of the Lotka’s law to the  observed values. The maximum deviation (Dmax) is calculated  by using n=2.654 in expected number of authors and it is found  that the value of D  is 0.0051.   
At  5  %  signifcance  level,  the  critical  value  can  be  computed using following equation: 
Critical Value = 1.36

The resulting critical value in the present data set is 0.040.  Hence, the actual value of D falls within the critical value of  D. Therefore, it can be said that the Lotka’s law fts the author  productivity distribution in the present data set.  
5.7  Citation  Impact  of  Level  of  Collaboration 
Collaborating  authors’  affliation  appear  in  the  papers  have been considered for measurement of collaboration level.  Table  8  presents  the  level  of  collaboration  and  its  impact.  Highest  number  of  261  articles  (29  %)  is  written  by  single  authors  followed  by  intra-institutional  level  of  collaboration  with 194 article (21.55 %) and inter-institutions within state  with 180 article (20 %). Only very few articles i.e. 11 are written  by Indian LIS authors collaborated with foreign authors. The  internationally collaborated articles attract maximum average  citation of 3.09 followed by the collaborated articles of inter- institutions outside state with an average citation of 2.66. It is  also observed that total 115 foreign authored article (12.78 %)  appear in the three journals and the articles received total 254  citations with an average citation of 2.21 per paper.

In last 6 years, the three leading Indian LIS journals publish  total 900 articles having average citation of 2.18. The average  Collaborative  Index  (CI)  and  the  Collaborative  Coeffcient  (CC)  indicate  the  trend  towards  dominance  of  collaboration  and joint authorship in LIS publications. Further, the present  dataset of author productivity distribution follows the Lotka’s  law  and  it  is  also  confrmed  by  the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  (K-S) goodness-of-ft test. In Indian LIS discipline, maximum  collaboration  happens  in  intra-institutional  level  and  inter- institutions within state level. However, the citation impact also  points out that the DJLIT articles and more authorship articles  get  more  average  citations.  Further,  the  articles  collaborated  internationally and Inter-institutions outside state also attract  greater citations compared to local level collaborations due to  its wider readership.   
Collaboration  outcomes  more  and  better  results  than  what we can achieve individually. Indian LIS authors should  give more emphasis on wide collaboration on different levels  instead of being independent authors to output more quality

and  interdisciplinary  works.  Hence,  inter-departmental  collaboration  between  LIS  schools  within  state  as  well  as  outside state may boost the Indian LIS discipline by producing  more quality works on emerging and other innovative research  areas.  There  is  also  a  dire  need  to  enhance  the  research  collaboration with LIS scientists from different countries. This  move is bound to increase the collaborative research output in  the international arena3.
