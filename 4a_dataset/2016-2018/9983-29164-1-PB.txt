 ABSTRACT 
Website plays an important role in every institution and every organisation. Websites are the gateway to an  institution through online mode. Libraries’ websites webpages help the users to get all the information online related  to the facilities and services provided by their respective libraries of an institution. IIM are the pioneer management  institutions and the libraries website/web page are to be maintained properly where the information should be  easily accessible by the user without any hindrance. The study is based on the information available in the library  webpage of the concerned universities. A checklist was designed and the library web-pages were evaluated based  on the previous evaluations of websites conducted by different authors. 
Keywords: Library websites, library webpage, content analysis studies, web content, IIMs libraries website 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The  present  world  is  full  of  information  and  it  has  to  be  communicated  in  a  proper  way  with  the  information  seekers  where  Information  Communication   Technology plays an important role in the interaction of  information  with  the  people.  The  impact  of  ICT  can  be  seen  in  every  sphere  of  life.  The  World  Wide  Web  has  become  the  popular  communication  tool  for  accessing  and sharing information on the internet. The easiest way  for  disseminating  and  communicating  the  information  is  done  by  the  publication  on  the  websites.  Websites  helps  in  accessing  the  universe  of  knowledge  across  the  globe1.  Websites  may  be  categorised  according  to  the  content;  like  homepages,  advocacy  pages,  business  pages, news pages and informational pages where library  and  information  centre  homepage  belongs  to  the  last  mentioned  type2. 
The universities, organisations and colleges maintain  their own websites for the communication with their end  users.  The  development  of  library  websites  was  started  in  the  1990s3.  The  library  website  plays  an  important  role for an institution. The library website/webpages are  the  primary  source  of  information  where  they  provide  information for their users. There are very few institutions  which  don’t  have  library  websites.  With  the  growth  of  the  library  websites,  it  is  needed  to  be  evaluated  from  time  to  time. 
Content  analysis  has  been  used  in  many  fields  to  examine websites and the impact of design elements and  to establish best practices for content creation and design4.  The  important  part  of  any  website  is  that,  it  has  to  be  up-to-date;  information  should  be  easily  accessible  and

maintained properly. The library website is known as the  gateway  of  an  institution  where  they  can  communicate  information  with  their  users.  The  analysis  of  library  website  is  an  important  practice  and  it  has  to  be  done  from  time  to  time. 
1.1  Indian  Institutes  Of  Management  (IIMs) 
The  Indian  Institutes  of  Management  (IIMs)  are  located  in  different  parts  of  the  country,  India,  for  providing  high  quality  management  education  to  the  various sectors of the Indian economy. There are altogether  thirteen  (13)  IIMs  in  the  country.  The  IIMs  are  the  premier  management  institutions.  They  have  earned  an  international  reputation.  The  IIMs  are  the  registered  Societies governed by their respective Board of Governors.  The  IIMs  located  at  Ahmedabad,  Kolkata,  Bangalore,  Lucknow, Indore, Kozhikode and Shillong are the oldest  IIMs  established  in  the  country.  The  other  six  (6)  new  IIMs  have  been  set  up  during  the  XI  Five Year  Plan  at  Rohtak,  Raipur,  Ranchi,  Tiruchirappalli,  Kashipur  and  Udaipur.  The  IIMs  conduct  different  courses  like  post- graduate  diploma  programmes;  fellowship  programmes;  short-term management programmes; organisation-based  programmes  and  research  (http://mhrd.gov.in/technical- education-3).  The  list  of  IIMs  along  with  the  Library  website/webpage  links  is  shown  in  Table  1.  The    IIM  Bangalore  has  been  excluded  from  the  present  study  because  of  the  inaccessibility  of  the  website  during  this  survey. 
2. REVIEW  OF  LITERATURE 
The present study is focused on the content analysis  of the IIMs libraries webpage/website. Many studies have

already been conducted on the usability and performance  evaluation  of  the  libraries  website  but  few  have  been  studied  on  the  websites  content  analysis.  
Clausen5   studied  an  empirical  survey  of  12  Danish  academic  libraries  websites  on  the  basis  of  38  website  evaluation  criteria  under  six  category  like  design  and  structure,  quality  of  information,  links  and  navigation,  aesthetic impression, miscellaneous, and general assessment  and  resolved  that    Danish  Academic  Libraries  was  average  in  comparison  to  that  of  websites  in  general.  He  also  suggested  that  regular  update  of  the  library  web  sites  was  necessary  for  its  development  which  can  be  done  with  the  help  of  user  studies  and  comparative  evaluation suggested by the author. Michalec6  conducted  web  content  analysis  of  82  art  libraries  website  and  analysed the content, contact details, hours of operation,  library  collection,  the  library  web  pages,  library  OPAC,  link  to  the  parent  institution,  number  of  clicks  required  to  navigate  library  information,  link  to  search  engines,  link  to  reference  assistance,  up-to-date  of  the  website,  etc. He concluded that web site maintenance is the most  important  issue  which  is  to  provide  webbased  library  services. Babu, Kumar & Gopalakrishnan7   examined  43  universities website in Tamil Nadu and revealed that the  majority of the university websites in Tamil Nadu are not  updated regularly so they have suggested for evaluating  the  websites  from  time-to-time  by  using  established  criteria  like  web  design,  accessibility,  arrangement,  etc.  Qutab & Mahmood8 has analysed 52 websites of Pakistan  including academic, special, public and national libraries  with  the  help  of  77  items  checklist  and  found  that  the  features  like-  accessibility,  speed,  navigation,  etc.,  were  highly  observed  in  comparison  to  that  of  library  functions  like  OPAC,  circulation,  reference  and  other  services  and  suggested  user  centric  studies  to  develop  the  interactive  websites  so  as  to  fulfill  the  information  seeking  needs  of  users. 
Kumar9, et al ., have studied the contents and usability  of six IIMs (Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Calcutta, Lucknow,  Indore,  and  Khozikode)  libraries  website  on  the  basis

of  about  60  criteria  the  study  reveals  that  the  basic  and  the required information are available in their respective  IIMs  libraries  portals.  They  recommended  that  the  date  of updating must be mentioned in the library website as  it  shows  the  currency  of  information  on  the  webpage.  Aharony10  analysed the academic libraries website during   2000-2010. He selected 31 academic libraries homepage  from the ACRL accredited LIS schools and study revealed  that  libraries  website  have  changed  over  the  ten  years  (2000-2010) with an immense use of e-journals and Web  2.0  applications.  It  is  observed  that  graphics  have  been  used in websites focusing in attracting their users.  Joicy  &  Rekha11   have  analysed  Central  University  websites  of  India  and  revealed  that  link  analysis  of  the  central  universities websites is an unexplored area of webometric  research.  The  study  finds  that  all  the  basic  information  and  details  (history,  links  to  contact,  copyright,  news  and  events,  etc.)  were  available  in  the  majority  of  the  central  universities  website  whereas  very  few  websites  provide  opportunity  for  the  user  interaction  in  the  form  of  feedback. 
3. OBJECTIVES  
(a) To  analyse  the  web  contents  of  the  IIM  libraries  
website 
(b) To  determine  the  library  services  and  the  facilities  
provided  through  their  respective  library  website (c) To  suggest  measures  for  the  improvement  of  the  
IIM  libraries  website 
4. METHODOLOGY 
The  survey  method  of  research  has  applied  and  observation techniques have been used for data collection  from the respective libraries website of IIMs. A checklist  was  designed  for  the  data  collection  of  the  present  study.  On  the  basis  of  the  previous  evaluations  of  websites  conducted  by  Michalec12,  Babu,  Kumar  &  Gopalakrishnan13,  NoaAharony14,  Joicy  &  Rekha15,  112  criteria  under  the  10  headings  were  enumerated  to

analyse  the  contents  of  the  IIM  libraries  website.  The  data  of  webpage  size  and  download  speed  have  been  collected  after  the  analysis  of  the  IIM  libraries  website  URL respectively in the WebSiteOptimization.com (http:// www.website optimization. com/services /analyze/). The  present  study  is  confined  to  evaluate  the  web  contents  of  12  IIMs  listed  in  Table  1.  The  selected  libraries’  websites  were  analysed  at  various  times  and  the  data  were presented in tabular form and for analysis the data  Microsoft  Excel  is  used. 
5. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
5.1 Accessibility  of  Library Webpage 
Out of the 13 IIMs, 12 IIMs’ libraries website were  evaluated  (Table  1)  and  analysed  for  the  present  study.  Two  criteria  are  listed  under  the  heading  ‘Accessibility  of  library  web  page’.  Easy  access  to  the  information  for  the  users  from  the  home  page  is  an  important  part  of  any  website.  It  is  required  to  be  evaluated  whether  the  library  webpage  is  easily  accessible  from  the  home  page  or  the  links  have  been  provided  under  facilities,  quick links, etc. It is observed from the study that three  library webpages have the direct links on the respective  home  page  and  they  are,  IIM  Calcutta,  IIM  Indore  and  IIM  Tiruchirappalli.  The  other  9  library  webpages,  IIM  Ahmedabad,  IIM  Raipur,  IIM  Rohtak,  IIM  Ranchi,  IIM  Khozikode,  IIM  Lucknow,  IIM  Udaipur,  IIM  Shillong,  and IIM Kashipur, have the links under facilities, quick  links,  etc. 
5.2 Website  Classification  by Webpage  Size 
The  site  of  any  institute/organisation  should  be  constructed  in  such  a  way  that  it  should  be  accessed  withinpersecond.  The  WebSiteOptimization.com  (Web  Page Analyzer Tool) is used for the data collection of the  webpage  size  and  the  download  speed  of  the  particular  libraries  website.  Table  2  depicts  the  total  size  of  the  website  in  bytes.  For  the  present  study  56K  connection

rate  was  taken  to  represent  the  other  connection  rates.  The IIM Ranchi (5474207 bytes) and Kashipur (3053348  bytes) have exceeded the maximum size (3000000 bytes)  of the bytes so the data cannot be retrieved from the Web  Page Analyer Tool.  It  is  observed  from  the Table  3  that  the  download  time  at  56K  is  highest  in  IIM  Khozikode  (462.44s)  because  of  the  total  size  of  the  website  and  the  total  size  of  the  images  available  in  the  site.  When  the  size  of  the  images  is  more  then  it  will  definitely  take more time in downloading the page. In comparison  to all the IIMs, webpage of IIM Lucknow (22.56s) takes  the  least  time  for  downloading  the  page. 
5.3 Website  Descriptions 
It  is  observed  from  the  study  that  all  the  12  IIMs  websites are using graphics for providing the information  and  attracting  the  users  to  have  a  look  on  the  facilities  provided by the authorities about their respective institutes.  Seven  IIMs  facilitate  the  site  to  view  in  more  than  one  language,  i.e.,  English  and  Hindi.  The  websites  of  IIM  Calcutta,  Lucknow,  Udaipur,  Shillong,  and  Kashipur  provides  the  information  only  in  English  language. 
5.4 Navigation 
Table  3  shows  the  classification  of  websites  with  respect to navigation. In website design, navigation plays  an  important  role  which  can  be  achieved  by  the  proper  titles  and  the  links  back  to  the  homepage  from  any  in- link  webpage  of  the  particular  website.  It  is  observed  from the study that all the three criteria under Navigation  have  been  fulfilled  by  the  IIMs  website. 
5.5 Website Aids  and Tools 
The  features  under Table  4,  website  aids  and  tools,  include four items: Search option, feedback link/form, RTI,  and sitemap. IIM Ranchi and IIM Shillong websites don’t  provide  the  search  option  whereas  sitemap  is  available  in  the  12  IIMs  website.  IIMs  at  Rohtak,  Ranchi,  Indore  and Udaipur don’t provide the feedback link/form in their

5.6 Website Authority  Details 
Authority  means  the  author  who  is  an  expert  and  is  responsible  for  the  content  available  in  the  website.  The information available in the website must be reliable  and  truthful.  So,  once  the  information  is  uploaded  it  has  to  be  maintained  regularly.  The  authority  of  the  information  is  in  the  hands  of  the  website’s  copyright  who  regularly  update  the  date  and  avails  the  current  information  to  its  users.  So,  the  authenticity  of  the  information is confirmed by its authority only. The name  of the maintaining authority must be given on the home  page.  It  is  observed  from  the  study  that  out  of  the  12  IIMs  only  one  IIM,  i.e.,  IIM  Ranchi  does  not  provide  information  about  the  copyright  statement  and  none  of  the  IIM  websites  provide  the  information  about  the  maintenance  detail  of  the  website. 
5.7 Availability  of  Library Websites 
Under the heading ‘availability of library websites’  two  criteria  have  been  listed,  i.e.,  library  has  website/ webpage  or  a  page  dedicated.  It  is  observed  that  seven  IIMs, viz., IIM Ahmedabad, Khozikode, Calcutta, Lucknow,  Indore,  Tiruchirappalli  and  Kashipur,  have  their  own  library  webpage/website  and  the  rest  five  IIMs,  i.e.,  IIM  Rohtak,  Raipur,  Ranchi,  Udaipur  and  Shillong  has  a  page  dedicated  for  the  library  in  their  respective  IIM  website. 
5.8 General  Information  of  the  Library Webpage 
An institutions library portal must provide the general  information  about  the  library,  like  a  brief  introduction  of  the  library,  library  news  and  events,  library  hours,  library staff, ibrary rules, membership details, etc. Table  5  provides  the  general  information  available  in  the  library  webpage  of  IIMs.  All  the  IIMs  libraries  web  page  have  given  the  information  about  the  library.  It  is  observed from the present study that only IIM Ahmedabad  has  provided  the  facility  of  library  news  and  events;

7. SUGGESTIONS 
The  following  are  some  of  the  suggestions  brought  out  from  the  present  study: 
(1) The IIMs are the pioneer institutes of management in  
India. So, the IIM website must provide their separate  
library website with attractivity and interactivity one  
and  facilitating  all  the  services  available  for  their  
end  users. 
(2) The  library  website/webpage  must  create  in  such  
a  way  that  the  user  can  open  and  access  the  page  
easily  at  just  one  single  click  within  a  second  or  
few  seconds. The  more  number  of  graphics  used  in  
the  website  may  increase  the  download  time  of  the  
website 
(3) The  IIMs  must  include  the  copyright  maintenance  
details  in  their  website  to  make  it  effective (4) The dead links should be removed from the websites  
and the websites should be updated from time to time. 
(5) The IIM libraries websites must have the institutional  
repositories  so  that  they  can  share  the  scholarly  
published  literature  among  their  students  globally. 
8. CONCLUSIONS 
It  is  observed  from  the  present  study  that  all  the  IIMs library webpage is different in themselves in many  respects. It is observed from the study that only 7 IIMs  out of 12 IIMs have their separate library webpage. The  other 5 IIMs; IIM Raipur, Rohtak, Ranchi, Udaipur and  Shillong have a dedicated library page in their respective  
226 
IIM  websites.  It  is  recommended  that  each  of  the  IIM  institutes  must  have  their  separate  library  web  page  where they can independently provide all the information  relating  to  the  library  services  and  facilities  in  their  library  webpages.  This  will  help  a  great  extent  to  the  library  users  using  the  library  website  where  they  get  all the information at one place. All the library webpage  must  have  included  phone  numbers  and  email  IDs  of  the  responsive  person  of  the  library  in  their  respective  library webpage. The IIMs library webpage must make it  available all the detailed information about the e-resources;  library  collection  their  services  for  their  users  in  their  respective library webpages. All these facilities provided  by  their  institute  have  to  be  highlighted  in  their  library  webpage.  It  is  observed  from  the  present  study  that  all  of  the  IIMs  are  familiar  of  Web  2.0  tools.  But  not  a  single  of  the  IIMs  have  RSS  feed  in  their  websites.  It  should be noted that all the links provided in the library  webpages must be accessible. The library web pages must  be maintained regularly and updated. This will make the  demand  of  the  library  web  pages  among  the  users.
