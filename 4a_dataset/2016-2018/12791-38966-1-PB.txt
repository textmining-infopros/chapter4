ABstRAct 
Dyslexia (commonly known as word blindness) is a cognitive (learning) disorder characterised by an impaired  ability to comprehend written and printed words or phrases despite of intact vision. A quantitative literature analysis  was carried out on learning disorder - dyslexia from 1967 to 2016 (50 Year) for assessing the global research  trends. The emphasis has been given to analyse the research progress in dyslexia using bibliometric methods. This  literature-based study was carried out with the documents retrieved from the Scopus. There were 13455 articles on  Dyslexia in SCOPUS, distributed in nine document types and twenty eight languages. These literature were grown  at 6 per cent annually. Of ninety eight countries, USA shared highest contribution. India ranked 20th in terms of  total publication. The most of the research areas are centered towards psychology, learning ability and linguistics.

1.  IntRoDuctIon 
Historically, the term “Word Blindness” (Dyslexia) was  used for the person having normal intelligence but unable to  read  the  written  word  1,2. At  later  stage,  it  was  argued  that  the problem of Dyslexia is associated with visual perception  and  visual  memory3.  As  the  research  progressed,  it  was  theorised as  Dyslexia is a neuro-cognitive disorder which is  characterised by diffculty in acquiring reading skills despite  of adequate intelligence and suffcient reading opportunities4,5.  There has been different theory proposed on development of  dyslexia in general population. The strong theoretical opinion  about  dyslexia  appeared  as  genetic  basis6.  The  etiological  studies concluded that more than ten per cent school children  are  suffering  with  dyslexic  due  to  poor  identifcation  of  words7,8. More theories appeared which has strong co-relation  between  cause  and  effect  includes  phonological  theory9,10,  visual  processing11,12,  and  Neuropsychological  defcits13.  Continuous  research  and  development  is  taking  place  to  improve the diagnostic technology and treatment methods to  cure the diseases. The assessment and progress of research is  continuously being monitored through case studies and various  qualitative and quantitative research methods.  
Bibliometric methods are increasingly being used as an  analytical tool to monitor the progress and impact of research  and  performance  assessment  in  a  given  feld  of  study14,15.  The dyslexia cases are more concerned with the psychology

(especially child psychology) and education. A huge demand  has been created for the people who are able to understand the  prognosis and diagnosis of the disease16. With an increasing  academic requirement, there is a need to assess the multifaceted  research progress in dyslexia. There has been some bibliometric  studies  reported  in  speech,  language  and  hearing  sciences,  public  health17,  ophthalmology18,  ophthalmic  epidemiology  and prevention19, and otology20. None of these studies addresses  the research progress associated with dyslexia. The purpose of  the  study  is  to  analyses  the  growth  pattern  of  literature  and  research impact in terms of annual growth, most productive  country, institution and journals, most frequently cited articles,  multidimensional  research  growth  using  keyword  analysis,  impact of research in terms of citation21  and  h-Index22,23.  
2.  MEtHoDoLoGY 
The  bibliographic  literature  on  dyslexia  were  retrieved  from  the  Scopus  database  from  1967  to  2016.  Scopus  is  becoming one of the reliable sources of biographic indexing  and abstracting database which is now being used for various  benchmarking  activities  such  as  Times  Higher  Ranking,  QS  Ranking,  NIRF  Ranking  etc.  along  with  literature  and  bibliometric analysis.  
There are two major condition of dyslexia – developmental  and  acquired.  The  literature  on  this  cognitive  disorder  was  retrieved by using MeSH terms describing dyslexia. The search  criteria used for retrieving data is as follows.  
( TITLE-ABS-KEY ( dyslexia )  OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY  ( developmental  AND dyslexia )  OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY (

dyslexias) OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY ( acquired  AND dyslexia )  OR  TITLE-ABS-KEY (alexia ) )  AND  PUBYEAR  >  1966   AND  PUBYEAR  <  2017 
The search feld was chosen as Title, Abstract and Author  keywords, which covers almost all central theme of a research  paper. The time period was kept from 1967 till 2016 (50 year).  The term dyslexia was included in the MeSH list in 1966.

3.1 Document types  and  Language  of  Publication 
The 13,455 dyslexia publication were published in nine  document  type  during  the  50-year  study  period.  A  total  of  12,344 document were published in the 2127 journals was the  most  frequently  published  document  types.  It  was  followed  by  review  (1164;  8.65  %)  and  conference  proceeding  (661;  4.91 %), Book chapters (339; 2.52 %), letter (278; 2.07 %),  Editorial (241; 1.79 %), Note (192; 1.43 %). Other document  types were less than one percent share. The 13,455 document  on dyslexia were published in 28 language where, 97.67 per  cent of articles were published in fve major language. English  was  most  common  mode  of  communication  with  89.03  per  cent,  followed  by german  (3.51  %),  French  (3  %),  Spanish  (1.12 %) and Japanese (1.01 %).  
3.2  Publication  Growth 
There were 13,455 articles on Dyslexia during last ffty  years’ period. The Dyslexia literature in Scopus has grown at  the rate of 6.0 per cent per year. The analysis was carried out  in a block period of ten year and it is found that the maximum  growth was during the period of 1997-2006 which has witnessed

was estimated by focusing the location of the affliation country  of at least one author in the published papers. Not all articles  were included in the analysis as 2,043 (15.18 %) articles were  without author address information in the Scopus database.  
The  11,412  article  with  author  address  information,  published  from  98  country  during  1967  to  2016.  The  top  23  country/territory  with  more  than  100  article  were  ranked  according to fve indicator which includes total articles (TA),  share  of  publication  and  rank,  single  country  article  (SCA)  and rank, internationally collaborated articles (ICA) and rank,  total  citations  (TC),  average  citation  per  paper  (ACPP),  and  h-index as shown in Table 2. These countries shared 93.05 per  cent of global publication. Out of these, fourteen country are  from  European  region.  Some  of  the  study  reported  that  due  to diffculty is speaking English language by student in non- native English speaker may developed dyslexia24-26. Fourteen  country had only single country articles (SCA), whereas, ten  country  had  no  internationally  collaborated  articles  (ICA).  Twenty-nine country contributed only one or two SCA, while  nine country contributed only one or two ICA. All the top six  
288 
country with the most publications on dyslexia were occupied  by  the  seven  major  industrial  countries  of  the  world  (g7  country): United States, United Kingdom, germany, Canada,  France,  and  Italy.  These  were  ranked  from  1st   to  6 
th,  while  Japan was at 11th  position. Similar results were also reported on  research productivity in Photosynthesis27. The USA published  the most articles (29.17 %), followed by UK (17.44 %) and  germany (5.60 %). The USA also published most of the SCA  (2,836 article) followed by the UK (1,336 article) and France  (390 article). The USA also published most of the ICA (878  article), followed by the UK (746 article) and germany (357  article).

The article ‘Eye Movements in Reading and  Information Processing: 20 Year of Research’ (Ryan 1998) was  the most frequently cited articles published in ‘Psychological  Bulletin’  (IF2016=16.793)  with  3080  citations  till  December  2017 with an average citation per year of 162.11 citation. The  other most cited article by Seidenberg, et al.  (1989) with total  citation of 2,008 and average annual citation of 71.71 was less  impactful than 2 articles by Coltheart, et al.  (2001), (TC=1930;  ACY=107.2)  and  Le  Bihan,  et  al.   (2001)  (TC=106.88;  ACY=106.88) as shown in Fig. 4.  
The  citation  based  research  impact  measurement  is  the  quite popular technique in a given subject since long time31,32.  The  citation  window  for  these  top  cited  articles  states  that  only one articles Ryner (1998) shows a ‘early rise and rapid  decline’ in citation33, where as the articles by Seidenberg, et al.  (1989) and Hodges, et al. (1992) shows ‘delayed rise and slow  decline’ and turns out to be more impact full than the article  with ‘scientifc prematurity’34.  
3.7  Author’s  Keyword  and  Hot spot  of  Research 
The author keywords that appeared in the articles from  1967 to 2016 were ranked by frequency of use in the article. The  most frequently used keyword for all periods was “dyslexia”  as  it  was  also  the  keyword  used  as  search  term.  The  most  frequently  used  author’s  keywords  during  the  study  period  has  been  classifed  as  disease,  visual  processing;  cognitive  disorder,  language  processing;  phonological  processing  affecting  population,  environmental  factors,  diagnostics  and  treatment methods. Based on the frequency of use the hotspot  research  areas  in  dyslexia  centred  around  the  keywords  focussed on the category of disease includes ‘dyslexia’ (78.39  %),  ‘psychological  aspects’  (11.04  %),  ‘task  performance’  (8.49 %), ‘Attention defcit’ (7.11 %), and ‘learning disorder’  (6.96 %). The keyword ‘Task performance’ started appearing  after  1981  only.  The  keyword  which  depicts  the  visual  and  cognitive  disorder  includes  ‘reading’  (TP  =  3,925;  29.12  %),  ‘learning  disorder’  (TP    =  1,354;  10.06  %),  ‘cognition’  (TP  = 1155; 8.58 %). The keywords related to language and  phonological  processing  which  were  most  frequently  used  includes  ‘phonetics  (TP  =  2,058;  15.30  %),  ‘language’  (TP  =  1119;  8.32  %),  ‘language  disability’  (TP  =  937;  6.82  %),  ‘linguistics’ (TP  = 795; 6.44 %), ‘language development’ (TP =  425; 3.16 %). Based on these keywords it can be concluded that  the dyslexia is a disease which prevalence in the men having  learning disability even though they have normal intelligence  quotient35,36. 
4.    c oncLusIons  
The dyslexia is a cognitive disorder which with 10 per  cent  etiological  prevalence  among  the  school  children.  The  study  analyses  13,455  articles  from  Scopus  database  and  it  is concluded through bibliometric analysis that these articles  appeared  in  the  twelve  document  type  and  twenty-eight  
292 
different  language  during  the  period  from  1967  to  2016.  During these ffty-year period, the literature on dyslexia has  grown at 6.0 per cent per year whereas the maximum growth  of the literature came during the period of 1997-2006. The 98  country  contributed  in  dyslexia  research  and  all  developed  countries (g7) were among top productive region. The most  of the representation came from European region where there  were 14 country out of 22 most productive country. The USA  was most productive countries with highest number of paper as  well as citation count, but the articles published from Finland  ranked second with highest average citation per paper. Among  BRICS  countries,  Brazil,  China  and  India  make  into  most  productive countries. University of Oxford has published most  number of articles on dyslexia, whereas the articles published  from University College of London were most impactful with  highest number of citations. ‘Journal of Learning Disabilities’  had published most number of articles. The highly cited article  were  also  analysed  in  term  of  total  citation  and  there  were  eight articles with more than one thousand citation during its  citation life cycle. The keyword analysis successfully offered  interesting insights into the fact that the most of the terms used  by  author  as  author’s  keyword  were  focussed  on  education,  language,  phonetics,  learning,  cognition  and  neurological  defects and can be considered as hot spot of the research and  will  continue  to  grow  with  more  diagnostic  and  treatment  methods in near future.
