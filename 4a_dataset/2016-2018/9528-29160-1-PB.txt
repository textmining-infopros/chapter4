ABSTRACT 
The  multiplicity  of  journals,  fnancial  constraints  and  the  ever  increasing  needs  of  the  user  community  necessitated the libraries to develop need based information resources. Journals are key to scholarly communication  and study of the utilisation of subscribed electronic journals (e-journals) is important for libraries. A case study  of usage of the subscribed e-journals in the KMC Health Sciences Library of Manipal University (MU), Manipal  was conducted through citation analysis from the year 2010 to 2014. The study was performed with the objectives  to determine-citations of subscribed e-journals made in academic publications of fve health sciences institutions  of MU, Manipal; annual growth rate of the publications and the citations; and frequently cited journals and those  selected for publishing their documents. The Scopus citation database was used to retrieve all documents published  from the fve health science institutions using affliation search, and from their reference list, the number of citations  to the subscribed e-journals of the library were manually recorded. The study identifed subscribed e-journals that  were cited in published documents, cited frequently, and were selected for publishing the documents. The outcome  showed that citation analysis is a practical and reliable method to provide usage information of the subscribed  
e-journals of the library.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Library  collections  have  changed  significantly  over  the  past  three  decades  due  to  the  advent  of  information  and communication technology. One of the consequences  of  these  changes  is  the  subscription  of  resources  on  different  forms  of  electronic  version  like  e-journals,  e-books  and  online  databases.  Today  e-journals  have  become  the  major  resource  for  academic  and  scholarly  communication.  Effective  measurement  of  the  usage  of  subscribed journals helps to make appropriate decisions  about the journals that need to be retained for subscription  and the ones that may be discontinued from subscription.  Traditionally,  usage  of  print  journals  in  the  library  was  measured  using  re-shelving  data  of  journals.  In  such  cases,  each  time  a  journal  was  used  and  left  on  the  reading table in the library was counted as a single time  use  of  that  title.  Later,  citation  analysis,  i.e.,  the  study  of  journals  cited  in  the  references  of  publications,  was  formulated  by  information  scientists  to  track  how  often  people  cite  or  actually  use  the  work  of  others.  Citation  
analysis  of  references  at  the  end  of  the  documents  published in journals is one of the few major indicators  for  the  extent  of  usage  of  journals.  Ranking  of  journals  using  citation  analysis  is  a  key  aspect  of  knowledge  management  and  collection  development  in  academic  and  research  libraries1.

2. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
According  to  Lancaster3   evaluation  of  periodicals  are  examined  to  determine  the  utilisation  of  subscribed  journals through the collection of citation data, by actual  usage  data,  rating  of  already  collected  usage  data,  by  user’s opinion, by impact factor of journals, cost-effective  journals  (with  lowest  cost  per  use)  and  by  the  number  of  articles  contributed  to  a  particular  subject  area.  This  underscores the importance of citation analysis and actual  usage  data  for  the  evaluation  of  library  collection. 
Romic  &  Mitrovic,4 in  their  study  acclaimed  that  citation  checking  is  a  time-consuming  and  in-depth  approach  for  determining  the  usefulness  of  libraries’  collection  to  support  education  and  research  activities.  Citation checking of scholarly documents and comparison  of  those  citations  against  the  subscribed  materials  in  a  library  collection  offers  an  unnoticeable  method  of  evaluation  of  the  collection  and  usage  of  subscribed  resources. 
Duy5  exposed that citation data of the journals could  be considered as the mirror to the usage of the journals  by the researchers, who formally acknowledge the work  of others. Studies have also been conducted on whether  citation data correlate with electronic journal usage data,  with outcomes demonstrating significant positive correlation  between local citation data and electronic journal usage  data. Tsay6  investigated the relationship between library  journal  usage  and  journal  citation  usage  in  the  medical  sciences.  The  study  revealed  that  “the  most-used  and  most-cited  journals  are  in  some  way  the  journals  that  are  most  important  to  the  medical  sciences”.  
Pan7  pointed out that journal citation can be used as  predictor  of  journal  usage  in  libraries  and  can  be  used  as  a  valid  guide  for  the  selection  of  library  materials.  According to McDonald8, citation analysis is the standard  
195 
methodology  for  studying  journal  usage  in  information  science.  Margaret9   opines  that  citation  analysis  is  an  unobtrusive  method  for  journal  collection  evaluation.  Based  on  the  above  arguments,  authors  made  use  of  citation analysis in the publications of five health sciences  institutions  of  MU,  Manipal  to  identify  the  utilisation  of  subscribed  journals  in  the  KMC  Health  Sciences  Library. 
3. OBJECTIVES 
A study on the usage of journals is important to achieve  better  utilisation  of  budget  for  the  effective  collection  development, due to the vast collection of journals from  different publishers and high cost of subscription.No study  has been conducted for the comprehensive rating of usage  of electronic journals subscribed by the Health Sciences  Library  of  Manipal  University  at  Manipal  so  far. 
Currently  KMC  Health  Sciences  Library  is  subscribingjournals  from  more  than  35  publishers  and  it  becomes  imperative  to  assess  their  usage  in  order  to  make  decisions  regarding  renewal  or  subscription  and  to  replace  the  underutilised  journals  with  journals  of  users’ need. Journal citation analysis helps the library in  collection  development  and  in  deciding  which  journals  to renewfor subscription and which ones to cancel from  subscription.  The  current  study  was  conducted  for  the  citation  analysis  of  publicationsof  the  health  science  professionals to identify the usage of subscribed journals  at the KMC Health Sciences Library, Manipal University,  Manipal  as  a  case  study. 
The  study  has  the  following  objectives: 
(i) Analysis of citations of subscribed journals made by  
the  health  sciences  professionals  in  their  academic  
publications  using  Scopus  citation  database  from  
2010  to  2014; 
(ii) Determination  of  annual  growth  rate  of  academic  
publications  and  citations; 
(iii) Identification of subscribed journals that were cited  
frequently; 
(iv) Identification of subscribed journals that were selected  
for  publication  during  the  period  2010-2014. 
4. METHODOLOGY  
All  the  titles  of  journals  subscribed  by  the  KMC  Health Sciences Library were retrieved from the library  management  software  and  library  website.  All  types  of  documents-articles,  reviews,  conference  papers,  notes,  letters  and  short  surveys-published  by  the  five  health  sciences  institutions,  viz.,  Kasturba  Medical  College  (KMC), Manipal College of Dental Sciences (MCODS),  Manipal  College  of  Nursing  (MCON),  Manipal  College  of  Pharmaceutical  Sciences  (MCOPS)  and  School  of  Allied  Health  Sciences  (SOAHS)  were  retrieved  year- wise,  using  affiliation  search  of  the  Scopus  citation  database. References appended to the academic publications  of  the  five  health  sciences  institutions  were  screened

manually  to  record  the  number  of  citations  obtained  by  the subscribed e-journals of KMC Health Sciences Library.  All the journals subscribed (year-wise) by the library was  arranged  alphabetically  in  the  excel  sheet  for  recording  the journal usage and comparing the library’s subscribed  journals  against  the  journals  cited  in  those  publications  was performed. The study, besides, retrieved the data of  the subscribed journals that were selected for publishing  documents by the health sciences professionals from the  year  2010  to  2014.  The  data  was  analysed  using  Excel  software  and  is  presented  in  tables  and  graphs. 
Keywords that are used to retrieve academic publications  of five health sciences institutions using Scopus citation  database  are  as  follows: 
(a) Kasturba  Medical  College,  Manipal 
(b) Manipal  College  of  Dental  Sciences,  Manipal (c) Manipal  College  of  Nursing,  Manipal 
(d) Manipal  College  of  Pharmaceutical  Sciences,  
Manipal 
(e) Allied  Health  Sciences,  Manipal 
The  study  is  limited  to  subscribed  e-journals  of  the  KMC  Health  Sciences  Library,  Manipal  University,  Manipal, and only those publishers from whom the library  subscribed  more  than  3  journals  were  selected.

DATA ANALYSIS  
Publishing  Group  was  lesser  during  the  study  period  (2010-2014),  the  citations  of  these  journals  compared  to  the  journals  of  a  few  other  publishers  (Sage,  Taylor  & Francis) were higher as shown in Fig. 1. Most of the  cited  literature  is  from  the  Elsevier  Science  Publisher. 
5.2 Academic  Publications  and  Citations  of  Health  
Sciences  Institutions 
Table  1  presents  the  academic  publications  from  the  five  health  sciences  institutions  during  2010-2014  and  the  corresponding  number  of  citations  made  from  the  subscribed  journals  in  the  KMC  Health  Sciences  Library.  The  names  of  five  health  sciences  institutions  from  whom  the  academic  publications  were  gathered  is  shown  in  column  one.  The  number  of  publications  (583)  and  number  of  citations  (2774)  were  the  highest  in  2011.  KMC,  Manipal  showed  the  highest  number  of  publications (1766) among the groups followed by MCOPS  (453) for the study period. The total publications of the  five institutions for the 5 year period were2640 and the  corresponding number of citations, 11041. The number of  citations from the subscribed journals showed a positive  correlation  with  the  increasing  number  of  publications.  The  data  also  show  variations  in  the  growth  rate  of  publications  and  corresponding  number  of  citations.  The  highest  annual  growth  rate  was  observed  2011  for  both  publications  and  number  of  citations.  Details  of  
the  data  regarding  academic  publications  and  citations  of  references  of  documents  published  by  the  health  
publications  and  citations  are  given  in Table  1. The  Scopus  citation  database  was  used  to  collect

6.    FINDINGS 
Citation analysis is an unobtrusive method of evaluation  
of usage of subscribed journals of the library.The following  
are  the  major  findings: 
• KMC, Manipal showed the highest number of citations  
(6,858 citations) from the subscribed journals among  
the groups followed by MCODS (1,952citations) for  Figure 2. Journals that received citations of 10 times/year

publishing  their  documents  during  2010  to  2014. 
     The study found that the professionals of five health  sciences  institutions  citedmajority  of  the  subscribed  journals of the KMC Health Sciences library in all types  of publications; however, fewer journals were selected for  publishing  documents.  The  reason  for  variations  in  the  number  of  citations  may  be  due  to  increase  or  decrease  in  the  annual  publications. 
7. CONCLUSIONS 
Scientometrics techniques are used for various purposes  in the determination of different scientific indicators such  as  the  study  of  usage  of  journals,  selection  of  journals  for libraries and evaluation of scientific output. Citation  checking  is  a  time-consuming  and  in-depth  method  for  determining  the  usefulness  of  libraries'  collection  to  support  education  and  research  activities.  The  data  of  subscribed  journals  that  were  cited  in  reference  list  of  academic publicationswere analysed in this study. Citation  analysis  of  journals  helps  not  only  to  find  journals  that  are  being  used  but  also  to  identify  relevant  and  top  ranking  journals  in  particular  subject  areas.  The  study  identifies that with the increasing number of publications,  the number of citations also increased, there by throwing  light on the usage of subscribed journals. The study also  revealed the journals frequently cited by the health science  professionalsfrom among the journals subscribed by the  KMC  Health  Sciences  library  as  well  as  the  journals  that  were  selected  for  publishing  documents  by  those  professionals  during  2010-2014.
