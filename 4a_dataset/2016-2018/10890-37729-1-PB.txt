1. INtrODuCtION 
In the present knowledge society, open access (OA)  has  emerged  as  new  trend  in  scholarly  communication  over the internet. Open access has not only reduced price  and  permission  barrier  but  also  helped  in  bridging  the  gap  between  information  rich  and  information  poor.  In  other  words  it  is  a  great  advantage  for  developing  and  under  developed  countries.  Prior  to  the  open  access,  research  results  used  to  get  published  in  closed  access  format,  as  such  used  to  have  limited  viewership  with  limited  visibility  and  ultimately  limited  applicability.  Open  access  has  not  only  opened  up  new  vistas  of  publishing  and  making  the  research  output  easily  and  freely  accessible  to  common  masses  but  has  equally  increased the applicability of research output1. At the same  time, it has helped the users to access information from  different parts of the world just at a click of mouse. Open  access  is  direct  communication  between  the  author  and  the  reader,  with  a  minimum  of  mediation  and  tools  and  a  short  value  chain,  while  document  supply  introduces  added value mediation into the value chain of scientific  communication2.  The  Directory  of  Open  Access  Books  (DOAB) is the major milestone in facilitating organized  access  to  open  access  e-books. 
IFLA states that Open access is the now known name for  a concept, a movement and a business model whose goal is  to  provide  free  access  and  re-use  of  scientifc  knowledge  in  the  form  of  research  articles,  monographs,  data  and  related  materials. Open access does this by shifting today’s prevalent  business models of after publication payment by subscribers to  a funding model that does not charge readers or their institutions

for access3. Open access publishing which has become a trend  in social science, no doubt open access trend has signifcantly  rejuvenated the status and scenario of information retrieval and  dissemination across the world in the social sciences. Directory  of Open Access Books is a popular website of delivering access  to open access literature and provides the most comprehensive  list of open access books covering all disciplines.   
1.1 Open Access  E-  Books 
The origin of e-books can be traced back to the Project  Gutenberg started by Michael Hart in 19714. An e-book, short  form of electronic book, also known as a digital book, which  can be viewed on a desktop computer or a portable device such  as a laptop, or e-book reader. E-books now include both born- digital  and  made-digital  books. An  open  access  e-book  is  a  book in electronic or digital form that is available on the public  internet free of charge, which can be read on a computer, laptop,  or e-book reader. These e-books are available in different web  archives  like  digital  repositories,  institutional  repositories,  databases and digital libraries, and offer creative possibilities  for expanding access to information as well as changing the  learning  behavior  of  users.  Content  can  always  be  freely  available (24/7) to worldwide readers5. 
2. DIrECtOry Of  OpEN  A CCESS   B OOKS 
The  Directory  of  Open  Access  Books  (DOAB)  is  a  discovery service for peer reviewed books published under an  open access license. DOAB provides a searchable index to the  information about these books, with links to the full texts of  the publications at the publisher’s website or repository. The  Directory of Open Access Books was offcially launched on  1  July  2013.The  books  that  have  been  listed  in  DOAB  are  downloaded 512 times per year on average, compared to 252  times per year for books which are not listed thus; books in

DOAB are downloaded more than twice as much6. 
3. GrOwth Of  DOAB 
In 2015, 1311 new titles were added to the Directory of  Open Access Books, and 53 new publishers. The total number  of titles listed by the end of 2015 was 3776. The frst quarter  of  2016  saw  an  increase  of  604  new  titles,  with  eight  new  publishers joining DOAB. 
4. LItErAturE rEvIEw 
Whitford7 in  a  general  review  provides  a  detailed  note  on Directory of Open Access Books. Like its establishment,  history,  growth,  policy,  availability  of  books,  current  trends,  accessibility  and  its  services.  Stenson8   argues  for  the  value  of  the  directories,  mainly  focusing  on  DOAB  and  DOAJ. Snijder9demonstrates  the  higher  impact  of  open  access  monographs  disseminated  through  DOAB  at  Amsterdam  University  Press  (AUP).  Researcher  revealed  that,  for AUP,  the  DOAB  platform  is  very  useful  tool  for  promoting  Open  Access books.Dhanavandan10  paper discusses a global analysis  of  open  access  books,  which  are  available  in  the  Directory  of  Open Access  Books. The  author  found  that,  many  of  the  libraries  as  well  as  publishers  are  contributing  to  the  open  access  products  like  DOAB.Dhanavandan11 in  an  analytical  paper elicits the availability of open access books which are  accessible  in  the  Directory  of  Open  Access  Books.  Mary12 evaluates the importance of the directory of open access books.  Further researcher concentrates on the e- books available for  the education subject.  Fayaz4 study aims to assess the current  trends of the open access e-books in the feld of science and  technology available through DOAB. Study summarizes that,  the there is steady growth of open access e-books in Science  & Technology.  
5. OBjECtIvES 
The primary purpose of the study is to analyse the current  trends in the open access e-books on Social Science available  through DOAB. The other objectives of the study are to analyse  authorship  pattern,  year  wise  growth  of  e-books,  Subject  coverage, trends in pagination etc.  
6. SCOpE AND   L ImItAtIONS 
The  scope  of  the  present  study  is  limited  within  the  database of Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) and the  subject  area  is  Social  Sciences. Therefore  the  fndings  can’t  be  generalized  across  disciplines  and  directories.  In  Social  Science there are 10 subjects available such as Anthropology,  Education, Ethnology, Gender Studies, Library and Information  Science,  Media  and  Communication,  Psychology,  Social  Sciences (General), Sociology and Sport Science.  
7.   mE thODOLOGy 
The literature was reviewed on the open access movement  in India as well as Abroad. Then, the topic was selected for the  present study. Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) was  selected as a source for data collection while Social Science  was selected as the feld of study. The DOAB was accessed  during  the  month  of  August  2016for  collection  of  data  on  
142 
Social Sciences. The statistical data acquired was put to excel  worksheet  for  better  analysis  and  understanding  the  desired  objectives  set  for  the  study.  The  data  were  interpreted  and  analysed based on a set of parameters to get the precise picture  of  subject  coverage,  authorship  pattern,  year  wise  growth,  linguistic analysis, and pagination distribution.

9.   fINDINGS AND   D ISCuSSION 
Looking  into  the  results  it  is  evident  from  the  study  that,  the  collection  of  e-books  on  social  sciences  is  rapidly  growing on DOAB. These e-books cover major subjects like  anthropology, education, ethnology, gender studies, library and  information science, media and communication, psychology,  social  sciences  (general)  Sociology  and  Sport  Science  in  these subjects majority of E-books that is 332 (27.66%) are  available on social science (general) whereas only 15 (1.25%)  are  available  on  sports  science.  Out  of  1200  E-books,  1083  e-books are available under Creative Commons and 117 are  available  on  other  comparable  institutional  licenses.  The  licenses are very important to increase usage of these e-books  as they are available under the banner of ‘free to read and free  to  share’  for  all  non-commercial  purposes.  The  e-books  are  published  by  well  known  publishers  like  springer  and  other  academic publishers and institutions; hence quality of e-books  cannot be doubted. The maximum number i. e. 656 (54.66%)   E-books on DOAB are contributed by single authors followed  by 292 (24.33%) are contributed by two authors. Whereas only  36 (3%) of the E-books are Edited. The Social Science e-books  are published in different languages, majority in English i.e.  702 (58.5%) followed by German, Portuguese, Dutch, Italian,  Spanish  and  French  respectively.  It  shows  that  e-books  on  DOAB can reach wider population across the world because  these are the major languages in the world. The majority of  these e-books have been published in recent years from 2011- 16 (62.57%), which show that these e-books contain the fresh  thought and information. The pagination analysis shows that,  e-books are of various sizes, though the majority  of E-books  i.e.  609  (50.72%)  have  201-  400  pages.  This  shows  that,  e-books available through DOAB are well structured and well  documented. 
10. CONCLuSIONS 
Open access, in libraries emerging, which has helped to  bridge the gap in resource sharing, making it accessible in a far

better way, limiting the expenses and above all standardizing  which  helps  different  systems  to  share  their  resources.  The  present  study  shows  the  growth  of  open  access  e-books  in  the social sciences. The open access is the huge step taken to  promote knowledge based society. But still lot need to be done  explore the full potential. Many more directories need to be  created like DOAB. There is also need to be taken care of issues  like copyright violation, plagiarism, preservation of documents  and technological problems. What is more important here is  that, to provide an easy accessibility and increase in the number  of e-books on DOAB in the feld of social sciences.
