The use of social network sites among library professionals in university libraries in Ogun State, Southwest  Nigeria is investigated. The study population consisted of  seventy-eight librarians in four universities in the state.  Questionnaires (which was the instrument for data collection) were administered to the entire population, out of  which 55 (representing 70.5 % response rate) were flled, returned and analysed for the study. The study revealed  that library professionals do make use of SNS. The most frequently visited SNS was Linkedln (58.2 %). The  respondents also indicated that they visited SNS for the purpose of connecting and collaborating with friends and  colleagues, carrying out current awareness and reference services to library users, etc. Majority of the respondents  (94.5 %) in the study further revealed that the greatest challenge to the use of social network sites was lack of  social media skills. The frst hypothesis tested in the study indicated that there was moderate positive signifcant  relationship between device used for internet access and use of social network sites (r=.408**, N= 55, p<.002.).  The second hypothesis revealed that there was no signifcant relationship between gender and use of SNS (r = 0  .157, N=55, p >.05). The study was concluded with recommendations that library professionals should undergo  
training in social media skills.

1. INtROdUCtION 
The  advent  of  the  internet  in  the  21 
st 
  century  has  revolutionise  the  operations  and  services  of  workplaces  and  professionals  including  libraries  and  librarians.  Among the most influential tools of the internet in recent  times are social network sites. The strength of the social  network sites lies in their ability to enhance interactions  and  relationships  among  people.  Thus,  professionals  could  take  advantage  of  social  network  sites  (SNS)  to  meet  and  interact  with  clients  as  well  as  promote  the  operations of their workplaces. Suraweera1,  et al.,   view  social  networking  as  a  process  of  relationship  building  among  a  group  of  people  with  common  interest.  The  SNS  refer  to  the  various  internet  platforms  through  which social networking is enhanced and sustained. The  commonest  SNS  used  in  Nigeria  are  Facebook,  twitter,  MySpace, Youtube, Instalgram, Linkedln among others2.  Beyond  social  networking  and  relationships,  these  sites  have become major tools for interaction and collaboration  among  professionals,  organisations  and  their  clients  or  customers.  They  have  also  become  veritable  tools  in  publicising,  promoting  and  marketing  products  and  services.  Consequently,  organisations  and  professionals  have  found  the  use  of  SNS  inevitable  in  the  quest  for  survival in very competitive environments. Libraries and  librarians  are  not  left  out  in  this  trend. 
Ezeani & Igwesi2  observed that Nigerian libraries have  began  to  engage  SNS  as  tools  for  rendering  services  as  well as interacting with their users. For instance, Ezeani  & Eke3  posited that librarians in Nigeria are utilising SNS  as  tools  to  offer  ‘on  the  spot’  library  services  to  users.  These services include real time chat with users through  facebook  and  other  electronic  synchronising  platforms.  The opportunities and advantages provided by SNS have  left Nigerian libraries and librarians with no choice than  to  adopt  these  tools  if  they  must  remain  relevant  in  the  21st century  and  beyond.  The  ease  of  communication,  publicity and feedback mechanisms appear to be the selling  points  of  SNS.  Though  the  use  of  social  network  sites  by  Nigerian  librarians  generally  has  been  documented  in  the  past,  it  is  observed  that  current  issues  and  trends  in  the  use  of  SNS  among  librarians  in  Universities  in  Ogun  State,  Nigeria  have  not  been  thoroughly  covered.  It is against this background that this study examines the  use,  relevance  and  challenges  of  SNS  among  librarians  in  Universities  in  Ogun  State. 
The use of SNS among professionals has become a  global phenomenon. Librarians in Nigeria as professionals  are not left out of this trend. SNS provide professionals  including librarians with numerous benefits and advantages.  However,  the  current  trend  in  the  use  of  SNS  among  librarians in Universities in Southwest Nigeria is unknown.

This  is  particularly  important  because  these  librarians  are  facilitators  who  serve  the  information  and  research  needs  of  the  highest  strata  of  the  academia.  There  is  therefore  the  need  to  investigate  current  trends,  extent  of  use,  identify  challenges  and  proffer  practical  and  workable  solutions  with  a  view  to  helping  librarians  in  developing countries like Nigeria take full advantage of  social  network  sites.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  this  study  investigates the use of social network sites among library  professionals  in  Universities  in  Ogun  State,  Nigeria.

2.1  ICt,  Social  Media  and  Library 
The infiltration and inculcation of the utilisation of  information  and  communication  technologies  in  various  sectors  of  the  economy  of  nations  especially  education  has  brought  about  appreciable  level  of  improvement  in  peoples’  disposition  towards  new  technologies.  These  dispositions  have  impacted  positively  on  the  modus  operandi  of  professionals  in  the  education  sector,  to  which  Library  and  Information  professionals  belong.  
The  expectations  of  clienteles’  from  information  professionals have taken a totally new trend4  that is, it has  gradually  drifted  from  the  usual  manual  and  sometimes  cumbersome means of carrying out service provision, to  the  use  of  information  and  communication  technologies  in  service  delivery.  The  use  of  these  ICTs  has  brought  about an obvious increase in the level of efficiency and  effectiveness.  This  paradigm  shift  has  not  only  brought  about  heightened  level  of  effectiveness  and  efficiency  but has also placed more responsibilities on information  professionals  to  be  more  knowledgeable  and  savvy  in  the use of information and communication technologies.  The  ICT  platform  especially  the  internet,  has  provided  library users with the opportunity to access information  services and resources through virtual means; a reasonable  number of library users now have access to the library’s  electronic  resources.  The  application  of  ICT  to  library  and information practice has brought about the existence  of  the  term  ‘library  without  walls’.  Similarly  Ezeani  &  Igwesi  opined  that  the  concept  of  the  library  being  a  physical  place  containing  books  for  consultation  is  rapidly changing to a cyberspace that allows for access,  interaction  and  contribution  to  existing  knowledge.  
The use of ICT has also enhanced various services in  the library such as circulation services, reference services,  serials  management  etc.  Librarians  can  now  carry  out  specialised  services  such  as  selective  dissemination  of  information, current awareness services, reservations, etc.  through the use of these ICTs. Some of the important and  creative platforms for libraries and librarians’ interactions  with  their  clients  are  SNS.  Instant  messages,  e-mails  and  posting  of  information  on  social  network  sites  are  now  being  used  for  carrying  out  library  services  in  the  library.  
The SNS Web 2.0 platforms because there is usually

a  give  and  receive  relationship  between  the  sender  and  the  receiver  through  the  internet.  In  Nigeria,  the  use  of  SNS  helps  professionals  and  clients  to  make  public  profiles and foster relationships with each other through  forums,  chatrooms,  etc.5 
Boyd  &  Ellison6   gave  an  in  depth  definition  of  social  network  sites  as  ‘web-based  platforms  that  allow  individuals to create and manage a public or semi-public  profile within a bounded system, articulate a list of other  users with whom they share a connection, and view and  traverse  their  list  of  connections  and  those  made  by  others  within  the  system’.  
The underlining feature of SNS is that it allows for  the establishment and building of interactions. Similarly  Trampedach7   defined  social  network  sites  as  sites  that  allows  a  user  to  create  a  profile,  set  up  an  account  to  create a digital representation of themselves; select other  members of the site as contacts or connections, communicate  and engage with these users which automatically creates  a  social  graph  and  use  an  interface  (API)  to  build  applications. 
With  the  introduction  of  SNS  into  library  and  information  services,  there  are  some  activities  that  can  be  carried  out  in  the  library  which  couldn’t  have  been  possible  before  and  all  this  happens  using  the  internet  as a platform; hence Ezeani & Igwesi2  noted that social  media  have  become  very  important  and  has  positively  impacted the library profession tremendously in Nigeria.  They  posited  that  through  the  help  of  connection  of  networks,  messages  in  form  of  text,  pictures,  audio  and  video  can  be  transferred  between  individuals  or  among  people  in  a  group.  It  is  in  the  same  vein  that  library  and  information  professionals  make  use  of  this  social  media  to  communicate  with  clienteles  and  vice  versa.  Eke,  Omekwu  &  Odoh8   unequivocally  noted  that  ‘the  universality  of  the  social  media  or  SNS  has  conferred  on  it  its  present  popularity  and  importance  which  is  immeasurable  as  compared  with  other  media’.  It  is  the  result of this universality that allows for the interaction  between  or  among  librarians  and  their  clienteles.  The  thrilling  fact  about  the  use  of  SNS  or  social  media  is  that  they  are  not  only  being  used  on  the  computer  system  but  also  it  could  be  used  on  the  mobile  phones  and  other  devices  that  have  internet  access. 
2.1.1  Hypotheses 
The  following  hypotheses  were  raised  and  were  tested  at  0.05  level  of  significant: 
H01:  There  is  no  significant  relationship  between  the  
type  of  device  used  and  social  network  site  
usage  by  librarians.  
H02:  There  is  no  significant  relationship  between  
gender  and  use  of  SNS. 
2.2 Social  Network  Sites  by  Library  Professionals 
Library and information services are usually carried  

========2========

IDIEGBEYAN-oSE, et al.: LIBRARY PRoFESSIoNALS AND SoCIAL NETWoRK SITES 
out  by  library  Professionals  whose  main  functions  are  to  acquire,  organise,  disseminate  and  store  information  embedded  in  various  forms  of  information  resources  in  order  to  satisfy  the  varying  information  needs  of  their  clientele. Idiegbeyan-ose, Ilo & Isiakpona9  noted that ‘a  properly equipped library is a necessity when considering  the  intellectual,  moral  and  spiritual  development  of  library users’. However, these dynamic responsibilities of  dissemination and managing information by professionals  in libraries and information centres in Nigeria have been  made  more  effective  through  the  use  of  social  media  or SNS. Quadri & Idowu10  in their study on the use of  social media for information dissemination by librarians  in  nigeria  corroborated  this  fact  when  they  observed  that  73  %  of  librarians  make  use  of  social  media  for  current awareness services, 63.3 % for reference services,  56.7  %  for  selective  dissemination  of  information  and  about  58  %  for  library  orientation 
Some  of  the  ways  in  which  SNS  have  enhanced  library  and  information  services  include12:  
Reference  Services:   It  has  been  made  easy  through  the  use of social media. For instance through the platform of  Facebook, a user can have direct access to the reference  librarian  and  ask  queries  and  is  sure  to  get  response  immediately  or  almost  immediately.  The  response  to  queries could also be made richer through audio responses  on  platforms  like  facebook.  The  Skype  platform  could  even  give  the  user  and  librarian  the  opportunity  to  see  each  other  and  interact  better  even  without  coming  to  the  library. 
Current Awareness Services: Utilisation of social media or  SNS in LIS has brought about ease also in the process of  carrying out current awareness services. Library professionals  can simply place information on new arrivals, orientation  programmes,  electronic  resources  and  online  resources  available  in  the  library  on  the  sites.  Most  library  users  who will ordinarily not read such information would be  interested  in  them  now  because  they  are  publicised  on  social media and most of the library patrons will always  visit  these  social  media2.  
Reservations: In the aspect of reservations and renewal of  loans, instead of coming to the physical library building,  the  library  user  can  send  messages  to  the  circulation  librarian through any of the most convenient social media;  he can even go as far as making a call also through any  of  the  media  platform  like  Skype  or  facebook. User  Education  Programmes:  This  service  can  be  done  virtually  and  hosted  on  the  library’s  website  or  even  placed on YouTube for users to have access. This saves  library profession and clientele the rigours of organising  orientation  programmes  within  the  four  walls  of  the  library.  With  the  use  of  social  media,  orientation  and  user  education  programmes  can  be  done  virtually. Marketing of the Library Services:  Marketing of library  
sections,  available  resources  and  professionals  can  be  placed on the library’s facebook page or on Flickr. This  will  entice  reluctant  library  users  to  maximise  these  available  resources. 
Selective Dissemination of Information: This specialised  library  service  could  also  be  enhanced  through  the  use  of  platforms  like  LinkedIn.  This  is  because  LinkedIn  captures  the  area  of  specialisation  of  the  user  and  this  allows  the  librarian  to  source  for  resources  that  will  benefit  the  clientele.  The  value  added  to  the  services  of  the  library  by  the  use  of  social  media  cannot  be  overemphasised  hence  Taylor  &  Francis11   noted  some  advantages  of  adopting  social  media  in  the  process  of  carrying  out  library  housekeeping  functions.  Some  of  these  advantages  include: 
(a) It  ensures  feedback  from  users  thereby  enhancing  
library  services  evaluation 
(b) It  increases  usage  of  library’s  content 
(c) Cheap  publicity  of  events,  programmes  and  
services 
(d) To  ensure  connection  and  interaction  with  other  
librarians  
(e) It  requires  little  or  no  training  as  the  interfaces  
involved  are  very  user  friendly 
2.3 ChALLeNgeS 
It is pertinent to note that there are some challenges  involved with the use of SNS in libraries. Ifijeh12  identified  some  of  these  challenges  as: 
Copyright issues:  It is a common challenge when making  use of social media to disseminate information and this is  not restricted to information disseminated in print format  alone but it also cuts across information disseminated in  audio and video format. Librarians may infringe on some  authors’ copyright if they are not well knowledgeable in  the  process  of  making  information  accessible  on  social  media, hence it is paramount that information professionals  even  in  the  bid  to  satisfy  information  needs  should  not  go  beyond  the  dictates  of  the  copyright  law. Skills:  Technical  competence  is  a  point  that  cannot  be  overlooked  when  using  SNS  and  this  could  sometime  pose  as  a  challenge  as  some  library  professionals  may  not  possess  needed  skill  to  function  effectively  in  this  area.  Taylor  &  Francis11   reiterated  that  high  level  of  expertise  is  required  when  using  social  media;  they  noted  that  in  some  instances  the  library  professional  may  require  skills  for  customising  applications  that  aid  in  the  process  of  accessing  online  catalogs. 
Cost: Cost  of  carrying  out  library  services  using  social  network sites could be enormous. The cost here includes  cost of purchasing and maintaining needed infrastructure  and equipment, remunerations for technical staff, cost of  
services  is  also  made  easy  through  the  use  of  social  
regular  training,  cost  of  bandwidth,  electricity,  etc.  
Time consuming: Use of social media or SNS for carrying  
media platforms. Pictures of the library facilities, various  
out library services can be time consuming; this is because

any  information  professional  that  wants  to  be  effective  and efficient enough in quenching the information thirst  of his clientele would need to spend a lot of time on the  internet.  Clients  could  get  frustrated  if  they  send  in  a  query and do not get the needed response in good time;  hence  to  avoid  this,  the  librarian  would  always  have  to  spend  hours  on  the  internet  answering  queries Technophobia  and  Technostress:   Despite  the  level  of  infiltration of ICTs in library and information profession  today some information professionals still have that inert  fear of technology. They would rather stick to the manual  means  of  carrying  out  library  services.  Also  there  is  the  challenge  of  technology  related  stress;  information  professionals  that  make  use  of  ICT  tools  for  a  long  period  of  time  usually  experience  this  kind  of  stress.  Isiakpona  &  Adebayo13   explained  that  technostress  is  usually caused by the use of obsolete technology, power  fluctuation,  slow  network,  poor  sitting  position,  poor  computer  proficiency  skill,  etc.  
3. ObjeCtIve 
The  general  objective  of  the  study  is  to  investigate  use,  relevance  and  challenges  of  social  network  sites  among  University  library  professionals  in  Ogun  State,  Nigeria.  
The  specific  objectives  are  to: 
(a) Find  out  if  the  librarians  in  University  Libraries  in  
Ogun  State  use  social  network  sites 
(b) Find  out  how  often  the  librarians  in  the  libraries  
under  study  use  social  network  sites 
(c) Find  out  the  types  of  social  network  sites  use  by  
librarians  in  the  libraries  under  study 
(d) Ascertain  the  types  of  devices  that  the  librarians  
use  to  access  social  network  sites 
(e) Find  out  the  purpose  of  use  of  social  network  sites  
by  librarians  in  the  libraries  under  investigation (f) Understand  the  challenges  of  social  network  sites  
usages  by  librarians  in  the  libraries  under  study 
4. MethOdOLOgy 
The study adopted a case study approach. Seventy- eight  librarians  in  four  universities  in  Ogun  State  were  used  as  population  for  the  study.  
Table 1 four shows chosen the institutions were based  on proprietorship. one each is owned by the Federal and  State Governments respectively while two are owned by  private  bodies.  Total  enumeration  (census)  method  was  used  as  all  the  professional  librarians  is  in  the  selected  universities  were  used  for  the  study.  Questionnaire  was  the  research  instrument  to  collect  data  from  the  respondents. The questionnaires were administered to the  entire  population  in  their  places  of  work  and  a  total  of  55 questionnaires (representing 70.5 %) were completed  and returned. The data was analysed using the Statistical

5.1  Use  of  Social  Networking  Sites 
Figure  1  reveals  that  the  most  frequently  visited  social  network  site  by  the  respondents  under  study  is  Linkedln  –  58.2  %  visit  the  site  daily.  This  is  followed  by  twitter  (41.8  %),  Facebook  (40  %),  flickr  (32.7  %),  MySpace (25.5 %), HiS (12.7 %) and Instant Messaging  (9.1 %). It also shows that the respondents rarely visited  Wikis. 
5.2  Frequency  of  Use  of  SNS 
Figure  2  shows  that  the  library  professionals  under  study  do  visit  and  make  use  of  social  network  sites.  The  sites  they  visit  include  facebook,  twitter,  instant  messaging,  Hi5,  flikr,  linkedln,  RSS  feeds,  youtube  among  others. 
5.3 devices  Used  to Access  SNS 
Figure 3 reveals the frequency distribution of respondents'  responses  of  the  kinds  of  devices  they  use  to  access  social  network  sites.  The  results  show  that  92.7  %  use  iPad,  90.9  %  use  laptops  and  desktops  to  access  social  sites, 54.5 % Android, 52.7 % use BackBerry, and 9.1 %  Tablets. The findings shows that majority of respondents  use divers devices to accede social sites, especially iPad,  Desktop,  Laptop, Android  and  Black  Berry.

alternative  hypothesis  accepted.  This  implies  that  both  male  and  female  librarians  use  social  networking  sites  equally.  This  equality  among  male  and  female  librarian  might  be  due  to  the  minimal  level  of  exposure  to  ICTs  gadgets and access to computer systems in their various  place  of  work. 
6.  ReSULtS ANd  FINdINg S 
(a) Library professionals make use of SNS ranging from  
Linkedln, facebook, twitter, Myspace, etc. Frequency  
of  use  ranged  from  daily,  weekly  etc. 
(b) The  most  frquently  visited  SNS  by  the  respondents  
is  Linkedln.  Linkedln  is  a  SNS  that  serves  as  a  
veritable platform for linkage and collaboration with  
fellow  professionals.  Other  frequently  visited  SNS  
include  facebook,  twitter,  etc. 
(c) Majority of the respondents (65.5 %) do not use you  
tube  SNS  even  though  this  site  contain  important  
information  resources  for  teaching  and  research. (d) Mobile  devices  like  ipads,  anthroids,  blackberries  
and  tablets  were  the  major  devices  used  by  library  
professionals  to  access  SNS.  These  devices  have  
easy  and  cheaper  access  to  the  internet  through  
mobile telephony technology using subscriber identity  
module  (SIM)  cards. 
(e) The SNS are used to make new friends, connect and  
collaborate with colleagues, carry out current awareness  
and  other  professional  services  like  reference. (f) The greatest challenge to library professionals’ use of  
SNS is lack of social media skills. Other challenges  
include  low  bandwidth,  erratic  power  supply,  lack  
of  funds,  etc. 
(g) There was a moderate positive significant relationship  
between  the  device  used  by  the  respondents  and  
their social network sites usage (r=0.408**, N= 55,  
p<0.002.). 
(h) There was no significant relationship between gender  
of  respondents  and  use  of  SNS.  (r  =  0.157,  N=55,  
p>0.05). 
7. CONCLUSION ANd  Re COMMeNdAtIONS (a) A course on use of social media for library services  
should  be  introduced  in  library  schools  in  Nigeria.  
This will help to build social media skills in student  
librarians even before they leave school. They will find  
the  skills  useful  in  their  professional  practice. (b) Library professionals who are already out of school  
should  do  in-house  training  on  social  media  skills.  
Library  managements  should  invite  social  media  
professionals  to  help  train  their  staff.  The  Nigeria  
Library Association and The Librarians Registration  
Council of Nigeria (LRCN) should organise workshops  
on  building  social  media  skills  for  librarians. (c) Library professionals should look for alternative source  
422 
of  fund  to  train  themselves  on  skills  acquisition;  
they  should  apply  for  both  local  and  international  
sponsorship  to  international  organisations  such  as  
UNESCo, IFLA, Carnegie Cooperation of New York,  
among others, to attend workshops and conferences  
on  skills  acquisition 
(d) Relevant  authorities  should  provide  necessary  
and  adequate  funds  for  libraries  to  acquire  ICT  
facilities  that  will  enable  social  media  interactions  
between librarians and users. ICT facilities are very  
expensive to acquire. Funds must be made available  
for libraries to be well equipped to provide adequate  
and prompt services in the competitive world of the  
21st  century. 
(e) Telecommunication  and  multinational  corporations  
should be encouraged by Government to embark on  
corporate social responsibility activities in libraries  
especially  in  the  area  of  ICT  facilities  provision. (f) Library  professionals  need  to  increase  the  frontiers  
of  their  social  network  sites  use  in  carrying  out  
professional  services.  Librarians  should  not  use  
social network sites to connect and collaborate with  
colleagues  and  friends  alone.  There  is  a  need  for  
library  professionals  to  take  advantage  of  SNS  to  
expand  professional  services  to  users. 
(g) Library  professionals  should  improve  their  use  of  
social  network  sites  especially  the  use  of  you  tube  
as  majority  of  the  respondents  (65.5  %)  don’t  use  
this  important  site  for  their  research  and  teaching.
