Dengue is currently regarded globally as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease. The true impact of  dengue globally is diffcult to ascertain due to factors such as inadequate disease surveillance, misdiagnosis, and low  levels of reporting. Currently available data likely grossly underestimates the social, economic, and disease burden.  Estimates of the global incidence of dengue infections per year have ranged between 50 million and 200 million, there  are about 6,031 research paper collectively contributed by 22,234 scientist published in 6007 scientifc periodicals  in recent 8 years as the focus on this fever attracts attention of Scientists at the considerable rate.  The present  paper attempts to check the applicability of Lotka’s Law on the global publication on Dengue.  The study lights on  Lotka’s empirical law of scientifc productivity, i.e., Inverse Square Law, to measure the scientifc productivity of  authors, to test Lotka’s Exponent value and  the K.S test for the ftness of Lotka’s Law.

1.  IntRoDuctIon  
The  frequency  distribution  of  scientifc  productivity1,  pertaining  to  scattering  of  literature2,  and  concerning  word  frequency in the text3 are the three basic Laws of Bibliometrics.  Alfred  J.  Lotka  in  his  paper  on  “Analysis  of  the  number  of  publications  in  Chemical  Abstracts  from  1907  to  1916  on  frequency  distribution  of  scientifc  productivity”  proposed  an inverse square law of scientifc productivity. These laws,  extensively  studied  by  Fairthorne,  are  found  to  show  some  stable regularities4.  In general it is inferred that most names  occur few times, and a few names occur many times in a study.  Lotka in his classic paper published on frequency distribution  of scientifc productivity presented an analysis of the number  of publications listed in Chemical Abstracts from 1907 to 1916  with the frequency of publications of the authors and proposed  an inverse square law of scientifc productivity5. ‘if X authors  contribute  exactly  one  paper  each,  then  the  number  of  the  authors contributing n papers will be expressed in the terms  of the equation 
An  = X/n 
2    
for n = 1, 2, 3, ….etc 
where An= number of authors contributing n papers; x=number  of  authors  contributing  one  paper; n =  1,2,3,.....i.  It  is  also  expressed as  1/n 
2 
 where  1= X 
Lotka’s article was not cited for 15 year until 1941 and  his distribution was not termed as Lotka Law until 1949. This  law  has  been  tested  by  many  studies.  Murphy6   mapped  in  humanities and Schorr7  on librarianship, Pao

this  law.  Booksteen9   gave  modifed  theoretical  models  for  Lotka’s Law  
Ya = k/xa                 (1)  where Yx =  the relative frequency of authors publishing  
x   =  the number of papers 
 k  & á  =  constant  
Considering  the  fact  that n   authors  have  produced  one  article each, the value of constant k  can be easily derived, by  putting the value of Ya = 1 and a  = 2. 
Ya = k/xa  ;  1 = k/1 
2 
 ; K = 1  
In the other words the number of authors with x papers is  proportional to 1/x2 . 
This law was statistically verifed by Murphy in the feld  of  humanities  and  by  Schorr  in  the  area  of  map  literature.  Bookstein further studied Lotka’s Law in detail and generalised  the equation as: 
an   =  kx/ná   for  n  = 1,2,3….. 
The degree of conformity or non-conformity of various  empirical distributions to Lotka’s distribution has been tested  by  many  prominent  authors.  The  studies  on  the  ftness  of  Lotka’s Law began in a systematic manner that started with the  work of Pao using least square method with 48 sets of authors’  productivity data. The study found that majority of data sets  conform  to  Lotka’s  distribution  as  a  general  inverse  power  function (á = 2). Lemoline’s study10  regarding the productivity  pattern  of  the  CSIR  scientists  revealed  that  the  distribution  corresponding to the entire authors population does not follow  an inverse power relationship – either general or square and  showed  the  existence  of  a  fat  distribution  amongst  those

researchers with 10 or less number of articles and of an inverse  square  power  relationship  for  those  who  have  written  more  than  10  article.  Radhakrishnan  and  Kernizan11   concluded  that  Lotka’s  Law  in  the  generalised  form  seems  applicable  while considering the publication of authors in one periodical  whereas when considering the publications of authors in various  journals,  the  observed  values  deviate  considerably  from  the  value predicted by the law. Findings of Kumar12, Amsaveni13  and Batcha14  corroborate with the Lotka’s fndings and values  of ‘á’ were found to be around two. The study on Dengue by  Dwivedi15 reveals  that  Number  of  publications  increases  70  fold  in  given  time  span  during  1989-2015. Vietnam  has  the  highest  impact  (quality)  while  India  has  the  lowest  impact  among the leading countries. The study of Aloe Vera research  by Gupta16  revealed that Dengue publications registered 3.9 per  cent growth and averaged its citation impact to 9.57 citation  per paper. The top 12 most productive countries individually  contributed global share 5.36 per cent to 52.17 per cent. 
Dengue  is  a  mosquito-borne  viral  disease  that  has  rapidly spread in all regions of WHO in recent years. Severe  dengue  (also  known  as  Dengue  Haemorrhagic  Fever)  was  frst  recognised  in  the  1950s  during  dengue  epidemics  in  the  Philippines  and  Thailand.  Today,  severe  dengue  affects  most Asian and Latin American countries and has become a  leading cause of hospitalisation and death among children and  adults  in  these  regions. The  incidence  of  dengue  has  grown  dramatically around the world in recent decades. The actual  numbers of dengue cases are underreported and many cases  are  misclassifed.  One  recent  estimate  indicates  390  million  dengue infections per year (95 % credible interval 284 million  –528 million), of which 96 million (67 million – 136 million)  manifest  clinically  (with  any  severity  of  disease)17. Another  study, of the prevalence of dengue, estimates that 3.9 billion  people,  in  128  country,  are  at  risk  of  infection  with  dengue  viruses.

This  paper  has  following  objectives: 
(a)  To analyse the author productivity patterns in the feld of  
Global Dengue literature 
(b)  To examine the validity of Lotka’s law using total  
counting and straight counting of authors 
(c)   To apply Kolmolgorov- Smirnov (K-S) goodness-of-        
ft test for the conformity of Lotka’s law. 
3.  MethoDoLoGy 
The  study  retrieved  and  downloaded  the  publication  data of the world and of most productive authors on Dengue  Research from the Web of Science database during 2010-17.  (till  October  2017)  on  05-11-2017.  The  study  retrieved  and  downloaded the publication data of the world and of the most  productive  authors  on  Dengue  Research  from  the  Web  of  Science database during 2010-17. The Search word ‘Dengue  Disease’ and ‘Dengue Fever’ was used in ‘title’, abstract and  keyword” search tag and restricted it to the period 2010-17 in  ‘Period range’ search tag for searching global publication data.  The searches were performed on the names of Dengue Disease  and  Dengue  fever  with  all  probabilities  and  bibliographical  
details  of  6,031  research  paper  collectively  contributed  by  22,234 scientist published in 6007 scientifc periodical were  collected for application of Lotka’s Law. 
4.  DAtA AnALySIS AnD  D IScuSSIon 
It is observed from the data for the period 2010 to 2017  (Table 1) that 6031 research Publication were brought out with  collective responsibility as well as sole authorship. 288 author  have one, 656 author have two, 769 author have three and 735  author  have  four  papers  each  to  their  credit  and  so  on. The  maximum number of papers by an individual is found to be  288 which refect 4.78 per cent of total publications at global  level. Tests have been conducted to fnd out as to what extent,  the author productivity conforms to the Lotka’s Law. 
Lotka,  based  proposed  an  empirical  law  of  scientifc  productivity, i.e., Inverse Square Law, to measure the scientifc  productivity of authors as: 
Yx = k/x2                                (1) 
Bookstein presented a generalised form of Lotka’s Inverse  Square Law as Lotka’s Inverse Power Law as: 
Yx = k/xá            (2)          where Yx  =  the relative frequency of authors publishing  
x   =  the number of papers 
k & á  =  constant  
The  Lotka’s  law  and  its  modifed  version  have  a  wide  range of applicability to a variety of phenomena and the mere  form of such a distribution throws a little or no light on the  underlying  physical  conditions.  The  fact  that  exponent  has  approximately the value of 2 as depicted, enables us to state  the results in the following simple form: 
Yx = 6/ð2x2                  (3) 
as,  k =  6/ð2   for á =2 
The formula has two part: an exponent with value 2 in the  inverse square, i.e., 1/x2 portion of expression and a constant  6/ð2 (or 600/ð2  in percent) determined by the value of the  exponent.  Considering  the  fact  that  the  data  in  the  present  study  16278 author have produced one article each, the values  of constant k  can be easily derived, by putting the value of   Yx,  i.e., 1 and á =2 in  Eqn. (1). 
16278 =  k/1á          
By  taking  the  value  of  á  as  2  (Lotka’s  exponent),  the  expected values as in Table 2 are obtained. 
It  can  be  observed  from  the  Table  2  that  the  expected  values of are not close to the observed values. The frequency  distribution of authorship of Dengue research contribution is  tested by applying the Lotka’s law. An attempt is made to fnd  out the Lokta’s exponent value for the Global Scientists output  on  Dengue  publications,  calculated  by  using  the  formula  proposed by Pao18. 
           N Ó XY – Ó X Ó Y  
á   = ——————————               (4)             
        N ÓX2 – (ÓX)2  
where N  =  no. of the pairs of data considered  
X   =  the logarithm of   x 
Y =  the logarithm of  y 
Table 3 presents the values which are determined from  the logarithmic table and required for Eqn. (4).  Based on  Eqn.  (4),  the  Lotka’s  exponent  is  calculated  for  Global  Research

the 0.01 level of signifcance, i.e., 0.0168. Thus, distribution  frequency of the authorship follows the exact Lotka’s Inverse  Law with the exponent á = 2. However, the modifed form of  the inverse square law, i.e. Inverse Power Law with á and C  parameters as 2.498 and 0.7454 is not applicable and does not  appear to provide a good ft. Lotka’s law of author productivity  is regarded as one of the classical laws of bibliometric.  
 The present study showed that Lotka’ generalised law is  not applicable to Dengue literature. K-S test is applied to verify  the applicability of Lotka’s law of scientifc productivity. The  statistical  tests  show  that  the  Lotka’s  law  in  its  generalised  form does not ft the author productivity distribution pattern  prepared  for  the  straight  count  and  for  the  contribution  of  complete count of the Dengue Research Output.

The results obtained in this study do not follow the inverse  square power law of Lotka as such and similarly.
