ABSTRACT 
With the rising demand of the new users about technological assistance, the libraries need to change their  traditional way of functioning. The present generation is very much attracted towards social networking sites (SNS).  It is obvious for the libraries and information centres to tap the opportunity and provide services to the users by  using SNS. Since these sites provide quick and free access, the libraries can make good use of it. The present study  attempts to fnd out the awareness of the librarians of management institutions towards SNS and explores how  much they are using it. The study highlights that the librarians are much aware of SNS and are using them for their  personal and professional purpose, but on the same hand fails to use the SNS in their libraries. 
Keywords: Social networking sites, librarians, management institutes 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The  new  tools  on  internet  enables  users  to  access  information,  exchange  data  and  create  content  more  efficiently. Social networking sites (SNS) emerged as for  finding friends and getting connected with known circles.  Buroughs1   mentioned  that  ‘social  networking  websites  allow  users  to  share  interests  and  communicate  with  others.  Barsky  &  Purdon2   emphasised  that  SNS  collect  data about members, store and share user profiles. These  websites are free and allow users to easily create personal  pages  filled  with  content  in  the  form  of  images,  music,  and  videos.  Such  websites  function  as  a  social  network  because members are able to share web pages with friends  and search for new friends who have similar interests.’  Boyd & Ellison3   defined  it  as  “web-based  services  that  allow individuals to (1) construct a public or semi-public  profile  within  a  bounded  system,  (2)  articulate  a  list  of  other users with whom they share a connection, and (3)  view  and  traverse  their  list  of  connections  and  those  made  by  others  within  the  system.”  The  users  of  the  facebook  and  twitter  are  increasing  day  by  day.  There  are millions of users who use these sites on daily basis.  The  youngsters  seem  to  be  crazy  about  these  sites. The  different  studies  stated  that  the  uses  of  SNS  are  more  personal  than  academic  purpose.  The  libraries  are  also  taking  initiatives  to  participate  on  these  sites  but  the  ratio  is  low.  Breeding4   stated  that  SNS  can  provide  opportunities  to  promote  library  services,  contents  and  activities.  Library  outreach  and  public  relation  can  be  stronger  and  easy  with  the  help  of  SNS.  But  there  are  limitations  and  need  of  proper  policy  to  implement  any

new  path  by  going  out  of  the  walls  to  reach  maximum  users. 
2. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
Traditionally  libraries  were  only  storekeeper  of  knowledge resources but with the change in time libraries  have more responsibilities. They not only have to collect,  store,  disseminate  the  information  but  also  have  to  transform it into new ways of information packages. With  the  rising  demand  of  the  new  users  about  technological  assistance  the  libraries  need  to  change  their  traditional  way of functioning. With new techniques librarians need  to upgrade their skills. They have to develop competencies  in  searching  online  resources,  communicating  online,  posting right things and updating comments, etc. Social  networking  can  be  helpful;  in  information  seeking  and  sharing.  Information  is  easily  available  for  users  by  connecting  with  community  and  sharing  data  on  this  through  SNS.  Literature  showed  various  benefits  of  using SNS in libraries. MacAdam5  stated that Knowledge  sharing  is  possible  for  libraries  through  SNS.  O’Dell6  emphasised  that  ‘SNScan  help  libraries  to  reach  out  to  communities and gather knowledge from the interaction  between  librarians  and  users.’  Casey  &  Savastinuk7 mentioned that this online network can help libraries to  create  new  services  by  getting  ideas,  suggestions  from  Users. The study done by Palmer8 revealed that maximum  Australian  University  libraries  are  using  Twitter  and  Facebook  more  than  any  other  social  media.  
Literature  also  highlighted  that  there  are  several  factors  that  may  hamperrelation  between  libraries  and

users. In the study of fresher done by Connell9  reported  that  students  are  ready  to  accept  libraries  on  SNS  but  are  concerned  about  their  private  space  on  it  and  even  interference of library. Different studies done by Chu,10  et al., and De Rosa 
11,  
et al   found  out  that  the  concerns  of  privacy  from  users  have  negative  impact  on  usage.  Stuart12 stated that the if information does not get updated  regularly there will be negative impact on  effectiveness  of  SNS.  
3. OBJECTIVES 
The present study attempts to find out the awareness  of the librarians of management institutions towards SNS  and  explores  how  much  they  are  using  it.  
The  objectives  of  the  study  are  to: 
(a) Find out infrastructure facilities available for accessing  
SNS  in  their  parent  institute. 
(b) Find  out  whether  the  management  librarians  are  
aware  about  SNS. 
(c) Identify  the  purpose  and  frequency  of  usage  by  
management  librarians. 
4. METHODOLOGY  USED 
The coverage of this study encompassed management  institutions affiliated to University of Mumbai and courses  approved by Directorate of the Technical Education (DTE)  and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).  All  other  institutions  were  not  taken  into  consideration.  The  list  of  the  institutes  was  finalised  by  referring  to  the  standard  sources,  namely,  the  Affiliation  section  of  Mumbai University and its website. Moreover, the same  has  been  crosschecked  through  the  Directorate  of  the  Technical  Education  (DTE)  and  the  All  India  Council  for  Technical  Education  (AICTE)  websites.  There  are  82  such  institutions  out  of  which  10  are  closed  or  not  fulfilling the criteria. The librarians of these institutions  were the main stakeholders for data collection. From these  72  institutions  70  (97.22  %)  librarians  had  responded.  Thus  the  data  of  these  70  librarians  are  taken  into  consideration.  
Questionnaire was used to collect data from librarians  of these management institutes. The structured questionnaire  was  framed  keeping  in  view  of  the  objectives  set  for  the  study.  In  addition  to  e-mail  and  online  media,  the  questionnaires  were  sent  by  couriers  and  even  in  some  cases  researcher  visited  the  respondents  personally.  Personal  visits  were  done  for  few  institutions  and  thus  interviewing method was also adopted whenever required  to  collect  data.

DATA ANALYSIS 
5.1 Facilities Available  in  the  Institutions  
Whether libraries have basic infrastructure facilities  or not is an important issue. Without basic infrastructure  it is not possible for libraries to provide fast and accurate  services. To  know  the  facilities  provided  by  institutions  the  responses  received  are  tabulated  in  Table  1.  
From  Table  1,  it  can  be  analysed  that  all  70  (100  %)  librarians  under  study  had  facility  of  computers,  65  (92.85  %)  had  LAN,  53  (75.71  %)  had  internet  via  Wi-Fi in their institutions.  Other facilities like scanners  were available to 54 (77.14 %) librarians, photocopying  facility was available to 54 (77.14 %), CD/DVD players  for  55  (78.57  %)  librarians. 
It can be interpreted due to their parent organisation   maximum have basic infrastructural facilities in. Due to  these facilities the librarians can access internet and are  in  a  position  to  interact  through  this. 
5.2 Awareness  and Accessibility  of  SNS 
Modern  trend  shows  that  SNS  has  entered  in  all  kind of services. Students of this generation are the best  adopter of these technologies. So it is important to find  out  whether  librarians  are  also  aware  and  access  SNS  or  not.  Responses  about  whether  the  librarians  under  study  are  aware  about  SNS  and  access  it  are  tabulated  in Table  2. 
From  the  Table  2  it  can  be  analysed  that  all  70  librarians  were  aware  of  the  SNS.  Out  of  70  librarians,  64 (91.42 %) were actually accessing SNS and 6 (8.57 %)  were  not  accessing  SNS.  Out  of  these  6  librarians,  2  (2.86  %)  librarians  mentioned  as  they  don’t  have  time  for accessing SNS; 2 (2.86 %) librarians stated that they  don’t  have  interest  in  accessing  SNS  and  2  (2.86  %)  accepted  the  fact  that  there  is  a  lack  of  infrastructure  for  accessing  SNS.  
Out  of  70  librarians  only  64  are  accessing  SNS.  Thus  for  further  research  only  these  64  librarians  are  taken  into  consideration  as  total.

Figure 2.  Common factors of impact. 
• 33  (51.56  %)  librarians  stated  that  SNS  provided  
suggestions in personal life and 31 (48.4 4%) stated  
that  they  have  got  professional  suggestions.  • 34 (53.13 %) librarians opined that they got expertise  
through SNS in personal life and 30 (46.87%) opined  
the  same  for  professional  life.  
• 39 (60.94 %) librarians stated that they post personal  
comments and 25 (39.06 %) stated they post professional  
comments.  
• 37 (57.81 %) librarians stated that they get personal  
comments  and  27  (42.19  %)  librarians  stated  that  
they  get  professionals  comments  regularly.  • 35  (54.69  %)  librarians  stated  that  their  colleagues  
post personal information regularly and 29 (45.31 %)  
stated that their colleagues post professional information  
regularly.  
Thus,  it  can  be  interpreted  that  more  librarians  believed  that  SNS  has  added  value  to  their  personal  life  than  professional  life.  For  expertise  or  for  getting  
Figure 3.  Benefts of SNS. 
comments  the  impact  is  more  on  personal  life.  It  can  also  be  seen  that  more  librarians  are  posting  comments  personally  than  professionally.  Even  colleagues  share  more  personal  things  than  professional  things. 
5.7 Benefits  of  SNS 
The  SNS  has  various  benefits  like  easy  access,  communication  and  faster  information  transfer.  The  question  was  asked  whether  these  librarians  believe  in  benefits of SNS. The responses are represented in Fig. 3  which shows that out of total 64 librarians, 30 (46.88 %)  librarians  agreed  that  because  of  SNS  all  can  get  easily  connected, 32 (50.00 %) librarians agreed that SNS ease  regular  work,  39  (60.94  %)  librarians  agreed  that  SNS  are helpful for knowledge sharing, 32 (50.00 %) agreed  that SNS can help for building knowledge repository and  37 (57.81 %) librarians agreed that SNS should be used  to  develop  interactive  learning  environment.  
It can be interpreted that librarians strongly believed  that  the  SNS  can  help  in  being  connected  with  their  
281

colleagues,  friends  or  relatives  very  easily.  It  is  good  to  see  that  librarians  believed  that  SNS  can  help  in  building  knowledge  repositories  which  may  give  them  good  resource  for  hunting  knowledge.  Followed  by  this  maximum agreed that SNS can help in interactive learning  which  shows  that  librarians  have  positive  feeling  about  use  of  SNS  in  learning  process  and  if  used  properly  it  may  have  good  impact  on  learning.  
5.8 Library  Profile  and  Reasons 
The SNS applications are open, and free to use. The  functionality  of  SNS  provides  opportunities  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  any  processes  if  used  properly.  To  find  out  whether  libraries  are  taking  help  of  SNS  to  enhance  their  services  librarians  were  asked  if  they  has  created  library  profile  on  SNS,  if  not  then  reasons  for  the same by giving options. Out of total 64 librarians 16  (25  %)  said  their  their  library  has  profile  on  SNS  and  48  (75  %)  said  they  did  not  have  it  but  were  interested  to  have  in  future.  Those  who  are  not  having  profile  on  the  SNS  were  further  asked  about  reasons  which  are  mentioned  in  Table  5.  
From Table 5, it can be analysed that out 48 librarians  who  have  said  that  they  don’t  have  profile  on  SNS,  36  (75  %)  were  believed  that  there  can  be  possibility  of  misusing  account,  45  (93.75  %)  said  the  unwanted  comments  can  damage  the  image  of  the  library,  39  (81.25  %)  said  that  there  is  less  to  update  on  SNS  as  very few new things take place on regular basis, and 35  (72.91  %)  stated  that  there  is  a  less  demand  from  users  to  go  on  these  sites  for  library  use.  
It can be interpreted that many librarians are scared  of  wrong  comments  or  comments  can  come  which  can  damage  the  image  of  the  library.  It  can  also  be  seen  that misuse of account can take place which may create  wrong  impression  about  library.  Thus  librarians  are  not  creating  profiles  on  SNS.

6. DISCUSSIONS 
The  main  purpose  of  the  study  was  to  find  out  the  awareness  of  SNS  among  librarians  of  management  institution in Mumbai. The data indicates that all librarians  are aware about SNS and are using it on daily basis for  one or the other reasons. It is good to see that maximum  institutions  are  providing  infrastructural  facilities  like  computers and internet to librarians. But some institutions  banned  such  sites  due  to  policy  or  fear  of  misuse.  The  
282 
purpose for accessing was shown that maximum librarians  are using these sites for personal reasons than professional.  Though librarians believed in benefits of SNS like getting  connected,  knowledge  sharing  and  interactive  learning  is  possible,  but  many  don’t  have  library  profile  on  SNS.  Overall  it  can  be  observed  that  the  librarians  are  using  new  techniques  of  SNS,  but  the  usage  is  towards  personal  than  professional  information.  This  is  may  be  due  to  hindrances  like  fear  of  privacy,  getting  misused  by  users  and  even  very  less  to  update. 
It may be suggested that proper policy for accessing  SNS  and  training  may  lead  to  right  use  of  SNS  for  right  purpose.  The  study  suggests  that  the  effective  change  and  general  acceptance  may  lead  to  more  clear  communication  and  more  interactive  growth  of  library  profession  among  management  institutions. 
7. CONCLUSIONS 
This exploration revealed that libraries need to upgrade  with the upcoming tools like SNS. The combination with  these will help libraries to provide more quality services  by interacting users more efficiently. Users can response  quickly  which  may  help  libraries  to  improve  on  their  services. Libraries and users community can change the  perspective  of  using  SNS  for  more  knowledge  sharing.  The  time  will  need  to  change  the  user’s  perspective  in  using  SNS  with  libraries.  Libraries  may  need  to  put  some restrictions and limitations on users usage to avoid  inconvenience and misuse of this facilities. The findings  imply that libraries can improve theefficiency of functions,  communication  and  interaction  through  SNS.
