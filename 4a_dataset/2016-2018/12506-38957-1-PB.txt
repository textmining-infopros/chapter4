ABSTRACT 
This paper discusses teenagers’ need of library resources and library services in the public libraries in Iran.  Descriptive method is used and a researcher-made questionnaire formed the major instrument for data gathering.  Descriptive and inferential statistics are applied. It found that teenagers’ need is more textbooks than other resources,  of course their frst priority is educational books. It means that the teenagers interest to educational books, but it  wasn’t their main need. Most used library services was familiarity to library while adolescents need to expand and  improve lending services. Finally, it was concluded that libraries were less successful in meeting the teenagers’ need  based on their priorities. Therefore, libraries need to be equally important in the development of their resources and  services based on the priorities and needs. In this way, their needs are answered, and according to their priority, the  library will answer their leisure time according to teenagers’ interest.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The information equals with power in modern societies.  “The librarians should be familiar of the type of information  which  retrieve  by  the  users  and  they  need  to  know  how  to  access information”1. The purpose of the public library is to  fulfl information need of users, potential users and non-users.  As such, these needs related to educational activities, research  activities, professional activities, recreation activities, cultural  activities, and personal development. The teenagers are valuable  for the society. It is essential to have an effective investment in  order to educate, train and guide them effciently. Public libraries  have  a  special  responsibility  to  enrich  the  teenagers’  spare  time. It is essential to have a careful plan for correctly guiding  their inquiries. Versus information need, Information seeking  behavior  depends  upon  the  document  procurement  services  and  knowledge2   and  information  communication  technology  ICT  Literacy  impacts  on  the  users  information  need3,4.  The  Iran Public Libraries Foundation (IPLF) established by law in  1993. This foundation is responsible for the administration of  public libraries in Iran. It has a branch of each province. The  entrance examination for the university is a factor of teenagers  in using of these libraries. Also, the fnancial status of families,  the  social  and  cultural  status  of  each  nation  has  a  profound  impact on the use of technology in libraries5. Our purpose of  the study was to identify the teenagers’ need from the public  libraries’ services and resources under supervision IPLF. Fig.1  s conceptual diagram of the research. We aimed to answer the  following questions:

How much do the teenagers’ use library resources and library  services ? 
How  much  do  library  resources  and  library  services   meet  teenagers’ need? 
Is  there  any  relationship  between  the  extent  of  success  of  public  libraries  in  meeting  teenagers’  need  and  their  demographic information? 
What  are  the  troubles  of  the  teenagers  in  using  public  libraries?

2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
The  review  of  literature  is  an  essential  prerequisite  for  any research investigation, as it helps the researcher to frame  the study in true lines of the topic and objectives of the study.  Here, an attempt has been made to review some the available  literature  on  this  subject.  Minudri6,  Latrobe  and  Havener7 identifed several areas of teenagers information needs. Fourie  and Kruger8  said that teenagers’ basic information needs can  be defned as physiological, affective, and emotional, and their  urges to seek information may be intrinsically or extrinsically

motivated. Shenton and Dixon9  created a typology of teenagers’  informational need categories.  Jackson10  determined the library  needs of incoming international students. Borzekowski11,  et al. found that teenagers access the Internet for health information  regardless  of  ethnicity,  gender,  or  school  status.  Najaf12 analysed information need of all mosque libraries’ users. Pors13 studied students’ use of public libraries for study purposes and  discussed the public library as a substitute or a complement  for  educational  or  academic  libraries.  Agosto  and  Hughes- Hassell14,15  presented a theoretical and an empirical model of  the everyday life information needs of urban teenagers. Yousef  and Yousef16  investigated the information seeking behaviour  and information needs at Iran khodro Manufacture Company  in Iran.  
Kumar17  found that most users visit the library to borrow  books, study and do research, locate information from books and  journals, and do light reading. Bhatti18  found that arts scholars  gather information for three basic types of activities namely;  teaching, research and administration. Asemi19,  et al.  studied the  factors that affect the high school users’ information needs in  the public libraries based on the individual, social, educational,  and  religious  factors.  Olarongbe20,   et  al.   investigated  what  constitutes the information needs of the library users.  Sangita  and Kumar Satpathy21  surveyed the factors affecting information  needs  of  faculty  members  of  teachers  training  institutions.  Bozorgi and Zarezadeh Mehrizi22  covered information needs  of  the  public  libraries’  members  under  Tehran  municipality  art and cultural organization. Agosto23  believed that two most  important shifts are the increasing focus on what the library  does over what the library has and the growing emphasis on  information  and  information  services  in  digital  forms  and  formats.  Gichohi24,   et  al.   found  that  business  information  needs of small-scale business enterprises are numerous, sector  specifc and cut across all stages of business development.  
Janus  and  Lacovic25   examined  information  needs  of  students  in  democratic  society  with  the  emphasis  on  their  perception and use of the public library in satisfying democratic  and civil rights. Winny and Patrick26  found that women refugees  face  the  challenges  in  accessing  information.  A  review  of  previous studies revealed the importance of studying teenagers’  information  need.  In  Iran,  considering  the  high  population  and the number of teenagers in the country, it is important to  consider teenagers’ need. A needs assessment process reveals  the  infuences  planning  in  the  library.  It  helps  to  manage  a  budget properly and users’ satisfaction. So this research tried  to investigate teenagers’ need in the public libraries under the  supervision of IPLF, Iran. 
of  study  was  frst  semester  2016.  Data  analyzed  by  SPSS  and  the  appropriate  statistical  procedures  were  applied  for  description and analysis. 
3. METHODOLOGY 
This  study  was  a  descriptive-survey  and  the  research  population contained teenager’s members (15 years - 18 years  old) in the public libraries under IPLF. A systematic random  sampling method was used to select 328 library members of a  population of 9418 in the public libraries. A researcher-made  questionnaire formed for data gathering. This instrument made  based  on  the  literature  review  and  researchers’  experiences  and knowledge. It assessed the face validity and the content  validity by either pretesting the instrument.

4.2 Teenagers’  Use  of  Library  Resources 
Table  1  shows  the  frequency  percent  of  using  of  library  resources  (LRs).  Also,  there  isn’t a signifcant difference in prioritizing LRs  preferences.  P-value  is  0.000  with  Chi-Square  444.237 and df(degree of freedom) 8 (<0.05), so  the claim of equality between use preferences is  not acceptable. First preference and most using  LRs were Educational Extra Books (RV:3.30) and  the last preference is Indexed Journals Database  (RV:6.56). Firedman test used to investigate the  difference in the preference among 9 information  resources preferences.

4.3 Teenagers’  Use  of  Library  Services 
Table 2 shows 51.5 per cent of the teenagers  used very-little of the Feast and Festivals which  are held by the public libraries. 14.85 per cent  used very-much of familiarity to library service  (LSs)  and  29.36  per  cent  used  very-little  of  the  Information  Service.  Firedman  test  used  to  investigate  the  the  quality  of  teenagers’  expectations from LSs. 
H0 : Priority of need to LSs are the same 
H1   :  At  least  the  priority  of  two  LSs  are  different 
  P-value is 0.000 with Chi-Square 209.532  and  df  4  (<0.05),  so  the  claim  of  equality  of  teenagers’  use  of  LSs  is  rejected.  First  priority  belongs to the lending services with RV:2.15 and  the last priority belongs to extra services (3.96) as shown in Table 3.

4.6  Relationship  between  the  Meeting Teenagers’  
Need  and  their  Demographic  Information  
The fndings of meeting teenagers’ need of LRs and LSs in  female and male and regarding educational majors and grades  are presented here. 
3.33 
4.6.1  Meeting  Teenagers’  Need  of  Female  and  Male 
T-test used to investigate the difference between females  and  males  in  meeting  teenagers’  need  of  LRs  and  LSs.  Based on the Likert spectrum, the meeting information need  of  teenagers  is  medium  on  both  genders.  For  LRs  and  LSs,  P-value is 0.188 and 0.294, respectively which is higher than  0.05 so there doesn’t seem to exist any signifcant difference  between females and males in using LRs and LSs as shown in  Table 6. 
4.6.2    Meeting  Teenagers’  Need  of  Educational  
Majors  and  Grades 
Table 7 shows regarding educational majors and grades,  P-value is 0.553 and 0.052, respectively which is higher than 0.05  so there is no signifcant difference between meeting teenagers’  need  from  LRs  in  different  educational  majors  and  grades.  In  meeting  teenagers’  need  from  LSs,  regarding  educational  majors, P-value is 0.033 which is lower than 0.05 so there is a  signifcant difference between meeting information needs from  LSs in different educational majors. But regarding educational  grades, P-value is 0.072 which is higher than 0.05 so there is no  signifcant difference between meeting teenagers’ need of LSs

in  different  educational  grades. To  investigate  which  majors  are responsible for this difference used Tukey’s HSD test. This  test allows to the researcher to further research the matter even  after collecting and its analysis. The result showed that there is  a difference between math and experimental sciences students  in using LSs. 
4.7  Prioritizing  the  Barriers  and  Problems  of  the  
Teenagers  in  use  of  Library 
The Friedman test to investigate the barriers and problems  of teenagers in using the library. Table 8 shows the less RV is  the more important barriers and problems of teenagers in using  the library. First priority is for lack of knowledge about new  resources (RV:4.4) and the last priority is for lack of providing  training programs to get familiar to the library (RV:6.37).  
5. CONCLUSION  
It  is  concluded  that  libraries  under  IPLF  were  less  successful in meeting the teenagers’ need in use of LRs based  on their priorities. The teenagers went to libraries mostly to  work on their educational and school projects. They used of  the educational resources and the reading room. It is in contrast  with the main purpose of the public libraries, upgrading the

information on the people. The reason was the lack of resources  in  school  libraries.  So  it  is  essential  for  school  libraries  to  upgrade their resources and services. Public libraries have been  successful in lending services but couldn’t meet other needs of  LSs. Many factors involved in the weak performance of public  libraries  such  as  lack  of  space  in  libraries,  lack  of  needed  equipment, lack of skillful librarian and so on. IPLF can make  some changes and provide appropriate atmosphere to provide  services  more  suitably.  Teenagers  in  public  libraries  didn’t  attention  to  Internet  resources  and  the  most  using  resources  were educational extra books. One of the other problems was  the lack of knowledge about new resources, lack of skills in  using computer programs for searching the resources and lack  of resources and equipment. Finally, the public libraries should  provide the facilities according to the population growth. They  should attention to the Teenagers’ Need and convince them to  study. Public library should be like a strong heart which pumps  the life blood into the body of society.
