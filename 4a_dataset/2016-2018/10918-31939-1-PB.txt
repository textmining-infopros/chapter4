AbstrAct 
The adoption of Web 2.0 tools in academic libraries in India, the barriers and motivating factor to its use is  investigated. The study involved an exploratory survey of the contents of the academic library websites in India.  The  websites  of  28  Central  Universities,  16  Indian  Institutes  of Technology  (IITs)  and  13  Indian  Institutes  of  Management (IIMs) were identifed for the study. A structured questionnaire was mailed to library professionals  from selected Universities and Institutes in India. The fndings suggest that the library professionals are favourably  inclined towards the use of Web 2.0 applications in libraries. The major barriers perceived include accessibility of  the internet by users, lack of incentives, institutional support, technical support, training, and resources. Personal  interest in using technology, proper training and technical support were found to be the major motivating factors. 
Keywords: Web 2.0 tools, academic libraries, india, barriers, motivators 
1.  IntroductIon 
The academic libraries play a key role in disseminating  knowledge  by  aiding  in  the  teaching,  learning  and  research  activities  of  the  higher  education  institutions.  The  library  and  information  services  are  going  through  a  transition  in  the  new  age  society.  The  technological  developments  have  transformed  the  way  people  access  and  consume  information.  In  response  to  the  changing  information  landscape,  libraries  are  making  efforts  to  meet  the  diversifying  needs  and  growing  expectations  of  the  users  by  adopting  new  technology  and  tools.  Web 2.0 is dynamic, participatory, and user-oriented. As  mentioned by Bachrach1, ‘for academic libraries’ purposes,  Web 2.0 offers a new and fairly easy way to connect with  patrons, promote our libraries, and offer our services in  a  convenient  context’.  The  academic  libraries  in  India  can  effectively  use  these  tools  to  reach  out  to  the  users  and  provide  better  services  to  them. The  paper  presents  the  findings  of  a  study  about  the  adoption  and  use  of  Web  2.0  tools  in  academic  libraries  in  India. The  study  was  undertaken  to  explore  the  challenges  to  the  use  of  Web 2.0 tools and applications in Indian libraries and to  gain  useful  insights  into  promotion  and  use  of  Web  2.0  tools  among  library  professionals  in  India.

intrinsic advantages of that platform: delivering software  as a continually-updated service that gets better the more  people use it.’ As mentioned by Chua & Goh3, Web  2.0  represents  ‘an  emerging  suite  of  applications  that  hold  immense potential in enriching communication, enabling  collaboration and fostering innovation’. Web 2.0 includes  technologies  such  as  ‘web-based  communities,  hosted  services, and applications, such as social-networking sites,  video-sharing  sites, Wikis,  blogs,  and  folksonomies’4. 
2.2. Adoption  of Web  2.0 tools  in  Libraries 
Web 2.0 tools have been widely recognised as an effective  mechanism of interactivity and communication. Kroski5 discussed the use of Web 2.0 tools for improved library  services. It is opined that new technologies will increase  user  participation  and  facilitate  the  libraries  to  provide  better services to existing users, reach out to prospective  users  and  ensure  optimum  use  of  available  resources6. 
Recent  research  shows  that  Web  2.0  technologies  are being adopted in libraries world over for serving the  patrons  better.  For  instance,  in  a  study  of  the  websites  of  120  libraries  from  North  America,  Europe  &  Asia,  Chua & Goh3 found a correlation between the presence of  Web 2.0 applications and the qualityof library websites. In  a similar study, Mahmood & Richardson7  surveyed 67 US  academic libraries and found that some form of Web 2.0  technology  was  being  used  in  the  library.  However,  a  closer  look  at  some  other  studies  conducted  (by  Han  &  
There  is  no  single  definition  for  Web  2.0,  but  the  Liu8; Harinarayana & Raju9  and Kim & Abbas

Linh11, in a survey  and  dynamic  content,  online  collaboration  and  sharing  of Australasian  university  libraries,  found  that  Web  2.0

technologiessuch  as  RSS,  Blogs,  IM  and  podcasts  were  being used with some basic features in only two-thirds of  the surveyed libraries. The status of the use of Web 2.0

applications in Chinese Universities was reported to be in  basic development stage by Han and Liu8. In a study of  top 38 Chinese university libraries they found that most  of the libraries were using only one or two applications.  Xu, Ouyang & Chu12 analysed the websites of academic  libraries in New York and reported that only half of the  surveyed  81  libraries  adopted  a  Web  2.0  tool,  with  IM  being the most adopted tool followed by blogs and RSS.  A  number  of  studies  related  to  the  university  libraries  across the world indicated applications such as RSS, IM  and blogs to be most applied features (Tripathi& Kumar4;  Harinarayana  &  Raju9;  Kim  &  Abbas10).  Boateng  and  Liu13   present  an  exploratory  study  of  the  top  100  US  academic  libraries.  They  found  SNS,  followed  by  blog,  RSS and IM most widely used tools, with all the libraries  having  a  presence  on  Facebook  and Twitter. 
2.3.  b arriers  to  the  use  of Web  2.0  tools 
There are different barriers and the challenges related  to  the  adoption  and  use  of  Web  2.0  tools  in  libraries.   According  to  Kelly14,  et  al. barriers  to  effective  use  of  Web  2.0  tools  include  sustainability  risks,  digital  preservation  risks,  user  disinterest,  and  accessibility  issues.  They  also  highlight  the  need  to  raise  awareness  andwillingness to use these servicesto ensure success in  providing  enhanced  service  to  the  user.  Chawner15 in  a  survey of LIS professionals in New Zealand categorised  the  various  barriers  as  institutional  barriers  (such  as  firewalls,  limited  access  to  services),  personal  barriers  (lack  of  time,  interest  and  skills)  and  technological  barriers  (lack  of  broadband  access).  She  also  identified

Methodo Logy 
Initially  a  preliminary  and  exploratory  study  of  the  library  websites  of  all  the  academic  libraries  in  India  was  conducted.  Only  those  university  libraries  which  have  a  proper  library  website  were  considered  for  the  study.  The  websites  of  58  university  libraries  (which  included 28 Central Universities, 16 Indian Institutes of  Technology (IITs) and 13 Indian Institutes of Management  (IIMs))  were  identified  and  analysed  further  to  identify  the  presence  and  use  of  the Web  2.0  features. 
This  was  followed  by  a  questionnaire  based  survey  to investigate the use of Web 2.0 tools, and the perceived  barriers  and  motivators  of  the  library  professionals  in  the selected libraries towards the use of Web 2.0 tools. The  survey  questionnaire  had  items  on  demographics,  familiarity,  barriers  and  motivators  towards  the  use  of  Web  2.0  tools  by  library  professionals  in  academic  libraries in India. The questionnaire was administered to  a  sample  of  120  library  and  information  professionals

privacy and security issues, changing information needs,  and lack of staff training. Cao16 mentioned  management  buy-in, lack of awareness, lack of user participation, and  lack  of  technology  staff  as  some  of  the  issues  related  to  the  use  of  Web  2.0  in  Chinese  libraries  and  stressed  on  the  need  for  systematic  training.  owasu-Ansah17 in  
The  questionnaire  was  administered  online  through  the  personalised e-mail. A few reminders were also sent. The  responses  thus  collected  were  analysed  and  interpreted.  The findings of the study are discussed in the following  sections.

highlighted the need for social media strategy, appointment  of  social  media  librarians,  and  continuing  professional  development  of  librarians  to  enable  effective  use  of  emerging technologies in academic institutions. Byrne18  provides useful insights into the legal and ethical issues  related to the user-generated content when Web 2.0 tools  are used in libraries. Some other barriers include lack of  privacy19, lack of necessary skills20, and doubts about the  reliability  of  tools21,  and  lack  of  institutional  support22  and  lack  of  policy  on  emerging  technologies23. 
The review of literature shows that there is a dearth  of  research  on  the  adoption  of  Web  2.0  technologies  in  Indian academic libraries. There is a strong need to explore  the  related  aspects  such  as  barriers  and  motivators  to  the  use  of Web  2.0  tools  in  academic  libraries  in  India.  Therefore, to fill the gap in literature, the present study  attempts  to  examine  the  extent  to  which  Web  2.0  tools  and  technologies have been adopted in Indian academic  libraries  and  the  related  barriers  and  motivators. 
The results from the survey are discussed in five sections:  use  in  select  Indian  academic  libraries,  demographics,  level  of  use  and  familiarity,  barriers  and  motivators. 
5.1. use  of  Web  2.0 technologies  in select  Indian  
Academic  Libraries 
As shown in Table 1 among the 58 academic institutions,  22(34%)  of  them  were  using  Web  2.0  tools  to  support  services  to  the  users.  The  findings  of  the  preliminary  study  suggest  that: 
(a) Web  2.0  technologies  being  used  include  Blog,  
Video  sharing,  Mashups,  Social  networking,  RSS  
and  IM 
(b) Blog  is  the  most  commonly  used  technology  while  
IM  is  the  least  used  one 
(c) The  libraries  are  still  at  the  early  stage  of Web  2.0  
development

(d) Web 2.0 tools such as wiki, social cataloguing, social  
bookmarking, podcasting are not used in any of the  
library  websites  considered  for  the  study  (e) The  use  of  Web  2.0  features  in  in  libraries  of  IITs  
and IIMs, which are premier education institutes in  
India,  is  modest  
(f) The  use  of  Web  2.0  features  is  found  to  be  very  
less  in  Central  University  libraries. 
It is also derived from the findings of the study that  the  use  of  Web  2.0  tools  in  Indian  academic  libraries  is  very  low.  This  is  surprising  result  considering  the  popularity  of  the Web  2.0  tools  in  India.

libraries having a blog to connect with the users. Blogs  are used for announcements of library services and events  and to provide information about new books, articles of  interest  and  databases  acquired  by  the  library.  
Instant Messaging (IM): The study revealed that Instant  Messaging (IM) is used only by 2 (23.44%) academic libraries.  These are libraries of IIT Kharagpur and IIT Hyderabad,  which use a Chat widget for connecting with the users. A  majority of the surveyed libraries provide asynchronous  reference service in the form of a web page named ‘Ask  a  Librarian’  with  a  small  form  or  text  box  where  the  user  can  submit  his  query,  feedback  or  suggestions. 
rss:  The  study  found  that  3 (5.17%)  library  websites  considered  for  the  study  use  RSS.  These  are  libraries  of  IIM Ahmedabad,  IIT hyderabad  and  IIT  Mumbai.

Facebook  and  twitter:  The  study  found  that  only  3 (5.17%)  academic  libraries  have  presence  on  social  websites such as Facebook and Twitter. These are libraries  of  IIM Ahmedabad,  IIT hyderabad  and  IIT  Mumbai. 
video sharing: Video sharing is the second most commonly  used Web 2.0 feature. The study found that Video sharing  feature  is  used  by  7 (12.06%)  libraries.  
Mashups:  The  present  study  found  Mashup  is  the  third  most  commonly  used  Web  2.0  feature.  Mashups  are  deployed by 6 (10.34%) academic libraries. IIT Kharagpur  uses mashup in the form of campus map. It also provides  virtual  tour  of  the  library  through  photos.  IIT  Patna,  IIT  Guwahati  and  IIT  Indore  use  mashups  of  map  for  providing  location  information.  
5.2.  Participant demographics  
Questionnaires  were  administered  to  select  120  library professionals. Total 80 responses out of 120 were  received, thus representing a response rate of 66.67%. Out  of the 80 respondents, 72.50% (n=58) of the respondents  were  males  and  27.50%  (n=22)  were  females;  12.50%  (n=10)  of  the  respondents  were  Librarians,  20%  (n=16)  were deputy librarians,  32.50%  (n=25)  were Assistant  Librarians, and 35% (n=28) were Technical or Professional  Assistants.  
5.3.  Familiarity  and use  of  Web  2.0 tools  and  
technologies 
The respondents were asked if they were aware about  
among  the  library  professionals  towards  the  use  of  Web  2.0  tools  in  libraries. 
5.4. Frequency  of use  at Work 
An attempt was made to assess the frequency of use  of Web 2.0 tools at work by the library professionals for  providing information services to the patrons. As shown  in  Table  2,  42.50%  (n=34)  respondents  indicated  using  it  sometimes  followed  by  33.75%  (n=27)  using  it  very  frequently. 3.75% (n=3) respondents reported rarely using  it,  with  the  same  number  indicating  never  having  used  it.  The  results  highlight  the  strong  need  to  encourage  the  use  of Web  2.0  tools  in  libraries.

5.5.  b arriers  to  the use  of Web  2.0 tools 
An  attempt  was  made  to  investigate  the  problems  and  difficulties  faced  by  the  professionals  in  using  Web  2.0  tools  and  technologies  in  academic  libraries.  The  respondents  were  asked  to  list  the  most  significant  barriers  from  a  list  of  12  barrier  statements.  Table  3  
were in affirmative. The respondents were asked about the  Web  2.0  tools  and  technologies  used,  to  understand  the  level of familiarity. As shown in fig. 1, it was found that  majority  of  the  information  professionals  were  familiar  with  Facebook  (86.25%,  n=69),  followed  by  Wikipedia  (85.00%,  n=68),  YouTube  (80.00%,  n=64),  and  Blogs  (78.75%,  n=78.75%).  On  the  other  hand,  only  25.00%  (n =20) indicated to have used Social Bookmarking and  12.50%  (n=10)  Mashups.  When  asked  if  the  Web  2.0  should be used in academic libraries, all the respondents  replied  in  positive.  This  shows  a  favorable  inclination  
the  Web  2.0  tools  and  technologies.  All  the  responses  
shows  the  rank  order,  frequency,  percentage  and  barrier  
strength  of  these  barrier  statements  on  a  scale  of  1

(strongly  disagree)  to  5  (strongly  agree).  The  measure  demonstrated good internal consistency with the Cronbach  alpha  coefficient  of  0.90.  The  results  indicate  that  the  major  barrier  perceived  by  the  library  and  information  professionals  was  the  accessibility  of  the  Internet  by  students or users. This was followed by lack of incentives  and  concern  about  security  of  Web  2.0  applications.  Lack of training, technical support, and time along with  lack  of  resources  (financial  and  infrastructural)  were  other  identified  barriers.  Lack  of  technical  skills  and  knowledge  about  Web  2.0  tools  and  technologies  were  at  the  bottom  of  the  list  of  barriers.  
5.6. Motivators  to  the use  of Web  2.0 tools 
The respondents were asked to identify and rate the  motivating  factors  that  influenced  their  use  of  Web  2.0  tools and technologies. They were provided a preselected  list of  8 possible motivator statements. Table 4 summarises  the  rank,  frequency,  percentage,  and  the  strength  of  the  motivating  factor,  on  a  five-point  scale  of  ‘1’  (strongly  disagree) to ‘5’ strongly agree. The statements are listed  in  descending  order  from  highest  to  lowest  mean  score  and  are  ranked  accordingly.  The  measure  was  found  to  have  high  internal  consistency  of  about  0.88  (alpha). 
As depicted by the results, personal interest in using  latest available technology and desire to interact directly

6.     d IscussIon  A nd concLusIons 
The present study highlights that the use of Web 2. 0  technologies in libraries in India is marginal and in initial  stages. The synchronisation of the library services to the  Web  2.0  is  a  challenge  for  libraries.  Serious  efforts  are  required  for  use  of  these  technologies  which  are  freely  and easily available. The libraries have begun to realise  the  importance  of  incorporating  Web  2.0  features  in  their  websites  to  increase  interactivity,  the  focus  must  be  on  adopting  new  approaches  to  library  services  by  integrating  various Web  2.0  components. 
The results of this study indicate that the accessibility  of the internet by users, lack of incentives, institutional  support, technical support, training, and resources are the  significant barriers perceived by the library and information  professionals.  The  information  professionals  were  also  found to be concerned about institutional support in terms  of  incentives,  financial  and  infrastructural  resources.  It  was  found  that  both  the  intrinsic  (such  as  personal  interest  and  willingness)  and  extrinsic  motivators  (such  as  training  and  technical  support)  are  crucial  in  the  use  of Web  2.0  by  the  information  professionals.

The librarian has a key role to play by utilising the  collaborative  and  interactive  opportunities  provided  by  the  Web  2.0  technologies  to  build  strong  connections  with  their  users  and  create  deep  user  experiences.  The  present  study  stresses  the  need  for  training,  technical  support  and  better  organisational  support  to  promote  the  use  of  Web  2.0  tools  and  technologies  in  Indian  libraries  which  are  way  behind  the  academic  libraries  in  developed  nations.  There  is  also  a  strong  need  for  establishment  of  necessary  policies  and  practices  for  ensuring  proper  implementation  of  technology  in  the  Indian  library  system.
