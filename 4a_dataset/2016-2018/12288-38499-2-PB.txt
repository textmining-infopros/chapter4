The study attempts to assess the journal packing density (JPD) of the research journals published across Brazil,  Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) countries during 2013-2015. The JPD of the research journals has  been computed on the basis of volume. The study covers 27 main subject disciplines and the JPD has been calculated  against each individual subject discipline. 2499 research journals were identifed as indexed by the Scopus from the  BRICS countries, constituting 6.92 per cent of total research journals indexed by the Scopus all across the world.  China is the leading country from the BRICS league to have the maximum 914 (36.57%) research journals. The  average JPD of the research journals published across BRICS nations is 132.77 research article per journal per  volume, which is far greater than the average global JPD of 101.84 research article. On average 92.55 research  journal are published across BRICS countries in each subject discipline. Physics and astronomy, engineering, and  energy are the three leading subject disciplines among BRICS nations having maximum JPD of 209.52, 191.40, and  190.08 research article per journal per volume. Apart from these, there are various other facts which have come to  the fore about the prevailing trend of JPD among BRICS nations.

1.  IntRoDuCtIon 
Research has become an integral part of the modern day  world  and  no  nation  can  aford  to  sustain  in  the  absence  of  research activities. There is a manifold increase in the research  activities  undertaken  by  the  developing  and  the  developed  countries  all  across  the  world,  contributing  signifcantly  to  the advancement of the world in general and their respective  country in particular. Given the impetus received by the research  activities all across the world, a growing surge can be observed  in the number of research articles published in research journals  all across the world, which has somewhere infated the Journal  Packing Density (JPD) of research journals.  
The concept of JPD is neither new nor old. Researchers  in the past have also discussed about the JPD, which directly  or  indirectly  refects  their  observation  about  the  increase  or  decrease  in  the  research  activities  all  across  the  world.  JPD   can  be  worked  out  at  diferent  levels,  like  at  country  level,  at subject level, at institutional level, at the journal level, at  author  level  and  more.  Basu1   in  a  study  related  to  scientifc  output of countries has assessed the JPD of research articles  at the country level and defned ‘Journal Packing Density for  a country as the ratio of the number of papers published in a  country’s own journals to the number of journals published’.  Accordingly, in the present study the concept of JPD has been

evaluated to assess the number of research articles published  in  each  volume  of  a  research  journal  in  any  given  subject  discipline.  Hence  JPD  can  also  be  defned  as  ‘the  average  number  of  research  articles  published  in  each  issue  or  each  volume of a research journal’.  
In the present study, an attempt has been made to work out  the JPD of the research journals published across the BRICS  nations.  BRICS  is  known  as  a  league  of  fastest  developing  nations, having Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa  as its member countries. The league came into being in 2001  and  originally  comprised  of  four  members,  excluding  South  Africa, which was included as the ffth member in the league  in 2010. BRICS nations is not only the league of the fastest  developing industrial nations of the world, but the fact is these  fve countries are also the home of worlds 3.6 billion people,  which constitutes around 40 per cent of the global population2.  In  view  of  above  factors  the  BRICS  league  of  nations  is  supposed to serve as an ideal universe for study. An attempt  has been made to determine the average number of research  articles  published  in  each  volume  of  a  research  journal  at  the  subject  level  among  BRICS  nations  to  that  of  the  rest  of  BRICS.  If  we  go  by  the  research  contribution  of  BRICS  countries as reported in SCImago in its 2015 dataset, then of  the total 30,11,688 research article published across the world  from 231 country, 6,76,027 (22.44 %) research articles were  contributed by BRICS countries3. This signifes the growing  research prowess of BRICS nations. It is being projected that

by the end of the 2025, the research contribution of BRICS  nations to the world would be 44.7 per cent4.

Researchers  all  across  the  world  have  undertaken  a  good  number  of  studies  which  discuss  and  deliberate  about  the scientifc output of countries, subject disciplines, regions,  institutions,  individuals  etc.  and  to  measure  this  scientifc  output,  research  journals  are  the  only  medium  to  undertake  such  studies. Accordingly,  the  concept  of  JPD  is  associated  with the research output, whereby a researcher computes the  average number of research articles published in each volume  of a research journal5. The JPD can be calculated against any  subject discipline, country, region, institution, etc. In the same  way,  the  research  output  published  in  the  research  journals  published from a particular country cannot be considered as  the research output of that particular country.  
China is being seen as one of the fastest growing research  country in the world in almost all the subject areas in general  and  social  sciences  research  in  particular6. The  researchers,  however,  remarked  that  Chinese  research  has  yet  to  make  its  impact  at  the  global  level.  The  manifold  growth  in  the  research activities in China was also observed by1 recording  the country’s scientifc output in terms of JPD . The researcher  found that the JPD of the Chinese research journals is almost  double the average JPD of research journals at the global level.  Though it is not necessary that the scientifc output published  in the Chinese research journals is entirely the scientifc output  of the Chinese researchers, as researchers from other countries  do  prefer  to  publish  their  research  results  in  the  research  journals  published  from  diferent  countries.  Researchers  have  observed  a  considerable  surge  in  the  research  articles  published by Chinese researchers7, which is being seen more  as a quantitative expansion, as country’s research sufers with  low  impact  in  terms  of  citation  threshold.  There  are  some  subject areas in which China has superseded the uS research  supremacy like nanotechnology and the trend may sooner be  witnessed in other subject areas as well8. 
The scientifc output of India is equally laudable, as the  country  is  gradually  marching  to  show  its  research  prowess  at  the  global  level.  The  scientifc  output  published  by  the  country’s research community in the Scopus indexed journals  reveals that India has consolidated its position from 13th  largest  research country in the world in 1996 to 6th  largest in 2015,  which is a growth of 116 per cent during the last 16 year9.  
kumar  and  Asheulova4   assessed  the  scientifc  output  of  BRICS  countries  from  1981-2009  observed  that  there  is  a  steady  and  constant  increase  in  the  research  output  of  the  BRICS countries. The researchers observed that during 1981  the research contribution of BRICS countries at the global level  was 2.4 per cent, which has increased to 20.1 per cent by the  end of 2009, which is an increase of 737 per cent. The research  contribution of china during the period increased from 0.2 per  cent in 1981 to 13.7 per cent by 2009 a signifcant increase  of 6,750 per cent. The research contribution of Brazil, India  and Russia did not increase to that signifcant level the way  it has increased in China. In a similar study10  to fnd out the  publishing pattern of BRICS countries the researchers observed  
that Brazil, China and Russia are not close to a core cluster  of countries that are more diversifed, except India which is  having more diversifed publishing patterns.  
In a study to analyse the growth of research articles to that  of research journals11  , the researchers studied the OA journals  indexed by DOAJ and found that research articles from 2000  through 2009 grew at 30 per cent annually, while as research  journals grew annually at 18 per cent. There may be numerous  reasons for the increased JPD of research journals, but to have  a sustained JPD it is imperative that research journals should  grow at constant pace so as to handle the pressure of publishing  of increased research activities. 
The  journals  indexed  by  the  commercial  databases  like  ISI and ulrich’s Periodical Directory12  on average publish 111  research articles per year, which is far more than the non ISI- indexed journals, which on average publish 26 research article  per year.  
3.  SCoPe AnD  Metho DoLogy 
The  study  is  based  on  secondary  data  retrieved  from  the  SCImago  Journal  and  Country  Ranking  on  January  25,  2017  and  is  accessible  at  http://www.scimagojr.com/3.  The  data upon retrieval was not in accordance to the need of the  study. however,  to  suit  the  requirements  of  the  study,  data  were structured as per the objectives of the study. Although the  study could have been performed by retrieving the data for one  year period like 2015 or so, but in order to make the fndings  more accurate, authentic, and reliable and to make data more  representative, the data were retrieved for the period 2013 to  2015.  The  three  years  data  have  been  summed  up  together  and  thereafter  average  or  mean  has  been  drawn  by  dividing  the total sum by three, which represents the average fgures  per year. Data analysis has been undertaken individually for  each individual BRICS Nation under each individual subject  discipline.  Journal  Packing  Density  in  each  table  has  been  drawn by working out the number of research articles published  in each subject discipline in each year and then dividing the  fgures with the number of journals published.  
Since most of the research journals complete one volume  in  one  calendar  year5,  as  such,  it  is  presumed  that  all  the  journals  under  study  complete  one  volume  in  one  calendar  year. Accordingly the average journal packing density (JPD)  has  been  computed  for  each  journal  on  annual  basis  viz.,  JPD  per  journal  per  volume.  The  JPD  against  each  subject  discipline under each table against each BRICS country has  been computed by applying the following method

• To compute the JPD of research journals published across  
BRICS countries in diferent subject disciplines against  
each individual country.  
• To draw a comparison between the average JPD of the  
research  journals  published  across  BRICS  countries

BRICS.  
5.  DAtA  An ALySIS 
The  data  analysis  has  been  undertaken  across  diferent  tables  by  performing  simple  mathematical  computations.  The common expressions like drawing share percentage and  drawing  average  were  performed  by  putting  data  in  the  MS  excel.  Percentage  at  most  of  the  places  has  been  rounded  of and the expressions have been drawn up to two decimal  places.  
In all, 95567 research article were published in 440 journal  indexed by Scopus across 26 subject disciplines from Brazil  during 2013-2015, at an average of 1225.21 research article  in each subject discipline in each year. On average, 31855.67  research article were published in 440 research journal across  Brazil in each year at an average of 72.40 research article per  journal,  per  volume.  Immunology  and  microbiology  is  the  leading subject discipline from the Brazil, which has average  JPD  of  138  research  article  per  volume.  On  average,  16.92  research journal are published in each subject discipline from  Brazil. Of the total scientifc research output published across  the research journals from Brazil per cent has been published  alone in the medicine. Similarly, of the 440 research journal  indexed by SCImago from Brazil, 89 (20.23 %) are published  in medicine, 70 (15.91 %) in social sciences and 68 (15.45 %)  in  agricultural  and  biological  sciences.  These  three  leading  subject disciplines together constituting 51.59 per cent share  of the total journals indexed from Brazil.  
A  total  of  360  research  journal  are  indexed  by  Scopus  from Russia across 24 subject disciplines at an average of 15  research journal across each subject discipline. In all 107381  research  article  were  published  in  360  research  journal  published  from  Russia  at  an  average  of  4474.20  research  
172 
published in 659 research journal published across India at an  average of 2373.66 research article in each subject discipline  each at an average JPD of 97.25 research article in each volume  of the journal. On average 24.40 research journal are indexed  by SCOPuS in each subject discipline from India. Of the total  journals indexed, 156 (23.67 %) are published in medicine, 64  (9.71 %) in pharmacology, toxicology and pharmaceutics and 58  (8.80 %) agricultural and biological sciences research journals.  in terms of research share, medicine leads the table with share  percentage of 22.52 per cent. Chemistry is the leading subject  discipline  which  has  the  maximum  JPD  of  192.59  research  article per journal per volume. Given the average JPD density  of  each  individual  subject  discipline,  it  can  also  be  inferred  that subject discipline which have more than the average JPD  of the country face shortage of research journals, which are not  published in proportion to the research output.  
In  all  585104  research  article  were  published  in  914  research journal published across China from 2013-15 across  25 major subject disciplines, at an average of 23404.16 research  article in each subject discipline. On average 7801.38 research  article were published in each subject discipline in each year  at an average JPD of 213.39 research article in each volume of  each research journal. Physics and astronomy, pharmacology,  toxicology  and  pharmaceutics  and  environmental  sciences  are  the  three  leading  subject  disciplines,  which  have  the  maximum JPD of 311.51, 258.06, and 249.19 research article  per volume per journal respectively. Engineering 196 (21.44  %),  medicine  127  (13.89)  and  earth  and  planetary  sciences  74 (8.10) are the three leading subject disciplines to publish  maximum  number  of  research  journals  in  China. A  total  of  914, research journal are indexed by Scopus from China across  25  main  subject  disciplines  at  an  average  of  36.56  research  journal in each subject discipline. In terms of research output,  Engineering leads the table with the overall research share of  23.08 per cent. 
From the South Africa, 126 research journal are indexed  by Scopus across 22 major subject disciplines. Medicine is the  leading subject discipline having 27 (21.43 %) journal indexed.  On average 5.72 research journal are indexed by Scopus from  South Africa against each subject discipline. During the period  of study 15073 research article were published in the research  journals published across South Africa at an average of 685.13  research article in each subject discipline. On average 228.37  research article have been published in each subject discipline  at  an  average  JPD  of  39.88  research  article  per  volume  per

journal.  Medicine  (31.11  %),  social  sciences  (12.39  %)  and  agriculture  and  biological  sciences  (11.08  %)  are  the  three  leading subject disciplines, which have recorded the maximum  research output from South Africa during the period of study,  hence can also be inferred as the most sought research subjects  in the South Africa. Material Sciences is the leading subject  discipline from the South Africa, which has the maximum JPD  of 118.67 research article per volume per journal. The reasons  for high JPD in material sciences and nursing discipline can be  owed to the fact that only 01 research journal in each subject  discipline are indexed by Scopus.  
In  all,  2499  research  journal  were  found  indexed  by  Scopus from the BRICS countries across 27 diferent subject  disciplines at an average of 92.55 research journal against each  subject discipline. During the period of study, 995392 research  article were published across the research journals in the BRICS  countries at an  average of  36866.37  research article in  each  subject discipline. On average 12288.79 research article were  published  in  every  subject  discipline  during  each  year  at  an  average JPD of 132.77 research article per volume per journal.  Physics and astronomy, engineering and energy are the three  leading  subject  disciplines  among  BRICS  nations  having  an  average JPD of 209.52, 191.40 and 190.08 research article per  journal per volume. The above average JPD of these subject  disciplines  also  indicates  that  the  research  journals  indexed  in these subject disciplines by SCOPuS are not in proportion  to their scientifc output, which leads to their increased JPD.

On average each  year 123777.13 research article were published in each subject  discipline in rest of the BRICS countries at an average JPD of  99.53 research article in each subject discipline in each journal  per volume. Among rest of the BRICS nations, Chemistry is  the leading subject discipline to have JPD of 277.79 research  article per journal per volume.  
6.  FInDIngS AnD  D ISCuSSIon 
Indexing of research journals by good indexes like Web  of Science, Scopus, etc has itself become one of the quality  parameters, whereby researchers tend to publish their research  results in such journals which are indexed by good indexes5.  Indexing helps a research journal to expand its visibility among  the global scientifc community, which itself results in journal to  gain popularity among the scientifc community. The indexing  of Latin American research journals in WoS increased from 69  journal to 248 during 2006-2009, which resulted in showing a

considerable impact of LA research at the global level13. It is  quite understandable that research journals indexed by popular  indexes receive lots of manuscripts all across the world, which  increases the pressure of publishing on these journals and also  infates  their  packing  density  by  accommodating  more  and  more research articles.  
The average JPD of the research journals published across  BRICS  countries  is  132.77  research  article  per  journal  per  volume, while as, the average JPD at the global level is 101.84  research article per journal per volume5. The average JPD of  Brazil is 72.40 research article per journal per volume, Russia  99.34  research  article,  India  97.25  research  article,  China  213.39  research  article  and  the  South Africa  has  the  lowest  JPD of 39.87 research article per journal per volume. The JPD  of Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa is below the average  global JPD, while as China is the only country among BRICS  which has more than double the average global JPD.  
The  JPD  of  individual  subject  disciplines  varies  considerably  among  BRICS  countries.  Immunology  and  Microbiology  is  the  leading  subject  discipline  from  Brazil  having  JPD  of  138  research  article  per  journal  per  volume.  Similarly, health profession from Russia has the JPD of 155.17  research  article;  chemistry  has  the  highest  JPD  of  192.59  research article per journal per volume in India. Physics and  astronomy  from  China  has  the  maximum  JPD  of  311.51  research article per journal per volume. Accordingly, material  sciences  have  the  maximum  JPD  of  118.67  research  article  from South Africa.  
Compared to average JPD of research journals published  all across the world and the rest of BRICS viz., 101.84 and  99.53 research article per journal per volume, the average JPD  of  research  journals  published  from  the  BRICS  countries  is  132.77  research  article  per  journal  per  volume.  Physics  and  Astronomy  is  the  leading  subject  discipline  among  BRICS  countries to have the maximum JPD of 209.52 research article  per  journal  per  volume,  while  as  chemistry  is  the  leading  subject both at the global level and among the rest of BRICS  to  have  the  maximum  JPD  of  266.66  and  277.79  research  article per journal per volume respectively. The higher average  JPD of research journals published from BRICS countries is  an indicator of the fact that research journals published from  BRICS countries face more pressure of publishing.  
Medicine is the most sought research area in Brazil, India  and  South  Africa,  having  research  share  of  20.23  per  cent,  22.52 per cent and 31.11 per cent research article, respectively.  While as, Physics and Astronomy is the most sought research  area in Russia having a share of 15.92 per cent and Engineering  in  China  had  the  maximum  23.08  per  cent  research  share.  Nevertheless, medicine is the second leading research subject  in Russia and China, which signifes that medicine is the most  sought research areas among the BRICS countries.  
Of  the  2499  research  journal  indexed  by  SCOPUS  from BRICS countries, Brazil has a share of 17.60 per cent,  Russia 14.40 per cent, India 26.37 per cent, China 36.57 per  cent and South Africa 5.04 per cent. Of the 995392 research  article published by BRICS countries during the period of the  study, 9.60 per cent research article have been published in the  research journals published from Brazil, 10.78 per cent from  
Russia, 19.31 per cent from India, 58.78 per cent from China  and meager 1.51 per cent from South Africa. China dominates  in  the  research  output  among  BRICS  countries,  which  is  distantly followed by India at the second place. China is the  only  country  among  BRICS  nations,  which  has  a  research  share more than its journal share while as, the rest of BRICS  have a lesser research share than their journal share.  
If we look at the journal distribution at the subject level,  then  of  the  2499  research  journal  published  across  BRICS  nations,  453  (18.13  %)  are  published  alone  in  the  subject  discipline of medicine, followed by engineering with 271 (10.84  %)  journal  and  agricultural  &  biological  sciences  with  195  (7.80 %). While as the share of research journals in medicine  among the rest of BRICS is 17.57 per cent, engineering 6.55  per cent and agriculture and biological sciences 5.04 per cent.  decision science has only 04 (0.16 %) research journal indexed  from the BRICS nations, which is lowest among all the subject  disciplines. On average, 92.55 research journal are published  in each subject discipline among the BRICS countries, while,  among  rest  of  the  BRICS  countries,  on  average  1243.77  research journal are published against each subject discipline.  
Apart from decision science, dentistry, health profession,  neuroscience,  nursing  and  veterinary  sciences  are  the  other  subject  disciplines  in  which  less  than  1  per  cent  research  journal  are  published  across  BRICS  nations.  Similarly,  arts  and humanities, business, management & accounting, decision  science, dentistry, economics, econometrics and fnance, health  profession, neuroscience, nursing, psychology and veterinary  sciences are the subject disciplines, which have less than 1 per  cent research share among BRICS nations.  
7. ConCLuSIonS 
Journal packing density of the research journals indexed  by popular indexes like WoS or Scopus is bound to increase all  across the world and so holds true about the BRICS countries.  Keeping in view the number of research journals indexed by the  Scopus from the rest of BRICS, the number of BRICS journals  is quite low than it should have been, give the formidability of  the BRICS league of nations. The lower number of research  journals indexed from BRICS countries questions the quality  parameters of the research journals published in these countries.  Even  the  research  contribution  of  the  BRICS  nations  at  the  global level is not healthy. There is urgent need that research  journals published from the BRICS nations should maintain a  better quality and should try to index more and more research  journals with indexes like WoS and Scopus, which will help  give more visibility to the research results produced from these  countries, and will also help in maintaining the JPD of research  journals in some key subject disciplines among few countries  at par with the JPD at the global level.  
The  scientifc  output  of  India,  Russia  and  Brazil  is  considered  as  formidable,  compared  to  China.  Researchers  have  shown  apprehensions  over  the  scientifc  output  of  the  China, which is unable to make a considerable impact at the  global level. The scientifc output of China is being seen more  as quantitative and less as qualitative. The lesser JPD of the  research  journals  published  from  Brazil,  Russia,  India,  and  South Africa  speaks  of  their  research  pace,  which  is  almost

same as the rest of the world. India and China are being seen  as  the  countries  which  have  the  potential  to  meet  out  the  requirements  of  global  human  resource,  but  it  is  the  quality  skill of the human resource which will make the diference and  needless to say that again quality research will always play the  key role in imparting quality training.  
The  research  output  published  in  the  research  journals  from a particular country by no means can be considered as the  scientifc output of that particular country alone. Researchers  all across the world publish their research results in diferent  research  journals5,  irrespective  of  the  country  the  research  journals are published from.
