1. INTRODUCTION 
Internet  has  a  great  impact  on  our  daily  life  and  brought several changes in the education sector. Internet  technology has transposed the discourse of information.  Now, information is available in different forms, i.e., from  print to electronic media. Previously, people used to read  only  print  books  but  due  to  technological  developments  digital  books/electronic  books  are  also  made  available.  
The  term  e-book  was  coined  by  Andries  Van  Dam  while working on a Hypertext Encoding System and FRESS  project at Brown University in 19601. Merriam Webster’s  Dictionary  defines  e-book  as,  ‘a  book  composed  in  or  converted  to  digital  format  for  display  on  a  computer  screen  or  handheld  device’2. 
1.1. Transition  from  Print  to  E-book 
The  transition  from  print  to  e-book  has  a  long  history.  Project  Guttenberg  by  Michael  S.  Hart  in  1971  probably  laid  the  foundation  of  e-books.  After  that,  Google  Book  Project,  Hathi  Trust  and  Internet Archive  are three important landmarks in e-book history through  which e-books in different domains made accessible freely.  NetLibrary,  Questia  and  ebrary  all  are  commercialised  platform  to  access  e-books.  With  the  launch  of  kindle  by  Amazon  in  2007  and  iPads  from  Apple  in  2010  the  e-books gained popularity among the users3. The use of  e-books  has  raised  several  questions  such  as  their  cost,  accessibility  and  copyright  issues  among  the  librarians.  Financial  and  permission  barriers  both  creating  hurdle  
Received 27 September 2016, online published 09 May 2017 
in  their  use.  To  overcome  these  issues,  open  access  movement  was  launched.  
1.2. Open Access 
Open Access is a new model for scholarly communication.  It  helps  in  the  use,  distribution  and  redistribution  of  scholarly  content  freely  to  everyone.  It  is  based  on  General  Public  License  (GNU)  or  creative  common  license.  With  the  recent  developments,  open  access  has  gained the momentum. Different funding bodies, libraries  and  publishers  come  across  hand  in  hand  to  make  the  movement  a  successful  one.  Different  e-journals  and  e-books  are  made  available  to  scholarly  community.  There  are  various  platforms  through  which  e-books  can  be  downloaded.  One  of  such  is  OAPEN  (Open  Access  Publishing  in  European  Networks). 
1.3. OAPEN  and  DOAB 
OAPEN (Open Access Publishing in European Networks)  was started in 2008 as an EU funded Project coordinated  by Amsterdam University Press. The OAPEN Foundation  is  an  international  initiative  dedicated  to  Open  Access  monograph  publishing,  based  at  the  National  Library  in  Hague5.  OAPEN  foundation  is  a  member  of  OAPSA,  Open  Access  Scholarly  Publisher  Association6.  Both  work together to form guidelines for publishers. OAPEN  library  contains  books  available  under  open  licenses,  from Creative Commons and the books that are published  under  terms  that  only  allow  for  personal  use7.

KHANCHANDANI  &  KUMAR: MAPPING OF  E-B OOKS IN  S CIENCE  & T ECHNOLOGy 
OAPEN  launched  a  new  service  for  discovery  of  Open  Access  books:  The  Directory  of  Open  Access  Books  (DOAB).  DOAB  is  providing  a  searchable  index  to monographs published under an Open Access business  model, with links to the full texts of the publications at  the  publisher’s  website  or  repository.  Officially  it  was  launched on July 1, 2013 but its beta version was made  available  to  public  from  spring  20125.  DOAB  basically  divided  into  17  subject  fields  of  both  Science  and  Technology and Humanities and Social Sciences and each  subject  field  is  further  divided  into  sub-branches8. 
2. LITERATURE  REVIEW 
In the preceding section, an attempt has been made  to  review  the  related  literature  by  searching  different  journals  and  databases  from  India  and  abroad.  The  reviewed literature has provided insights in undertaking  the  present  study  and  helps  in  knowing  the  different  lacuna  in  the  previous  studies. 
Anuradha & Usha9 in  their  study  analysed  different  e-books  access  models  (offline  and  online).  They  said  that e-books are not new but they are slow in uptake as  compared  to  other  e-publications  such  as  journals  and  newspapers.  The  possible  reason  is  that  the  technology  behind  e-books  has  yet  to  be  matured  fully.  But  due  to  involvement  of  commercial  publishers  their  use  has  been increased. Sahu & Arya10  highlight that open access  movement has been embraced keeping in view to increase  visibility.  They  find  that  the  awareness  towards  open  access publishing is increasing among scholars.They also  find that India’s contribution in open access has increased  in last few years. Snijder7  endeavoured to collect data of  1734 books available from OAPEN library platform. He  studied  the  influence  of  open  licenses  and  aggregation  in DOAB. He finds that aggregation in the DOAB has a  large positive effect on number of downloads than making  books available under open licenses. Loan & Refhat-un- Nnisa11 collected data regarding science and technology in  March 2014. They revealed that there were 307 e-books  available on science and technology in DOAB having eight  major  subject  areas  and  36  sub-fields.  Out  of  307,  178  e-books are published in English followed by 88 German  books.  Maximum  (285(79.80%))  e-books  are  available  through creative common licence while Dhanavandan &  Amizhchelvan12  found that 3379 e-books were available  in  DOAB  and  1584  books  published  in  English.  In  another  study  Dhanavandan13 found  that  publication  of  e-books  has  gradually  increased  from  2010. 
3. STATEMENT  OF THE  PROBLEM 
Internet  technology  has  democratised  the  education  sector  all  around  the  world.  But  the  academic  and  the  scholarly  content  is  not  available  freely.  It  has  both  permission  and  financial  barriers.  As  research  is  publically funded to make it accessible to everyone and  to  overcome  both  the  preceding  barriers,  open  access  movement  has  been  snowballed  all  around  the  world.  
Due  to  the  efforts  of  different  open  access  declarations  and institutions three important directories were launched  to  index  open  access  content  for  the  academicians,  i.e.  Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Directory of  Open  Access  Repositories  (OpenDOAR)  and  Directory  of  Open Access  Books  (DOAB).  
The  present  study  has  been  undertaken  to  study  the  mapping  of  e-books  in  Science  and  Technology  (S&T)  indexed  in  the  Directory  of  Open Access  Books  (DOAB). The study will be helpful in knowing different  open access e-books available in various subject domains  under Science & Technology. This study will be beneficial  for the authors, publishers and librarians. All these together  mutually help one another to create open access content  and can index their books in DOAB thereby increasing the  visibility. The results presented in the study will provide  new  insights  for  the  better  development  of  DOAB.

5. SCOPE AND  LIMITATIONS  
(a) The  study  covers  the  open  access  books  indexed  
in the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB) in  
Science and Technology. The subject covered has been  
determined according to DDC 23 (2011) edition which  
includes Science, Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics,  
Chemistry,  Earth  Sciences  and  Geology,  Biology,  
Botany,  Zoology,  Medicine  and  Health  Science,

DATA ANALYSIS  AND   INTERPRETATION 
7.1. Subject-wise  Distribution  of  E-books 
There  are  various  subject  domains  in  science  and  technology  as  already  mentioned  under  the  scope.  The  Table  1  depicts  the  subject-wise  distribution  of  e-books  in science and technology. The table shows that there are  1052 e-books indexed in DOAB in science and technology.  The data reveals that there were few e-books indexed in  pure  sciences  and  more  on  applied  sciences  in  DOAB.  The  health  sciences  is  on  the  top  having  473  e-books  because  open  access  movement  was  originated  through  health  sciences  scholarly  communication  itself.

which is followed by SciELO Books (Scientific Electronic  Library Online) from Brazil. 119 (11.31%) total e-books  were  published,  as  they  publish  e-books  under  different  platforms.  They  publish  in  Portuguese  and  have  By- NC-  SA  type  license  and  then  followed  by  ANU  Press  (Australian  National  University  Press).  They  have  their  own  license  which  allows  openly  access  and  publish  e-books  in  English  only.  
7.5. Language-wise  Distribution  of  E-books 
E-books which are indexed in DOAB are published in  varied languages of the world. Table 5 shows language- wise distribution of e-books. About 800 (76.04%) e-books  published  in  English  as  English  is  the  most  popular  language for scholarly communication which is followed  by  118  e-books  (11.21%)  in  Portuguese,  then  German  95  (9.03%)  e-books,  Italian  17  (1.61%)  e-books.  There  are  only  three  e-books  (0.28%)  which  are  published  bilingually  in  German  and  English  both.  This  data  is  reflected  from Table  4  also. 
7.6. Year-wise  Distribution  of  E-books 
Table 6 reveals the year of publication of the books  indexed  in  DOAB.  There  are  only  34  (3.23%)  e-books  which are published before 2000, moreover these books  are made digital by scanning. The table also depicts that  the publication of books grow up exponentially till 2006  and  again  after  2007  (decline  perhaps  due  to Amazon’s  kindle  which  provide  access  to    commercial  e-books)  it  starts  growing  with  maximum  in  2014,  182  (17.3%)  e-books  and  381  (36.21%)  e-books  in  2015  due  to  new  technologies  for  accessing  these  open  access  e-books.

KHANCHANDANI  &  KUMAR: MAPPING OF  E-B OOKS IN  S CIENCE  & T ECHNOLOGy 
(d) Frontier Media SA is the dominant publisher in the  
field  of  health  sciences  which  has  By-type  license  
and  publishes  e-books  in  English  only 
(e) 800  (76.04%)  e-books  publish  in  English  only  (f) 381  (36.21%)  e-books  published  in  2015  alone (g) 356  (35.11%)  e-books  are  single-authored. 
9. SUGGESTIONS 
Following  are  the  suggestions  made:  
(a) Authors and publishers both should come forward to  
make open access movement a successful one. They  
should  publish  in  open-access  and  adopt  creative  
commons  license 
(b) Proper facilities and infrastructure should be provided in  
the  library  to  maximise  the  usage  of  free  e-books (c) Link of DOAB should be provided in the libraries’  
websites 
(d) Authors’ should encourage to publish in open access  
domains  
(e) In-depth  indexing  and  minimising  the  errors  in  
DOAB  metadata  will  certainly  increase  its  usage. 
10. CONCLUSIONS 
Open Access Initiatives have accelerated the growth  of  openly  accessible  content  in  form  of  e-journals  and  e-books.  Open  access  movement  has  also  increased  the  visibility of research and thereby increasing the impact.  There  are  approximately  more  than  5000  e-books  in  DOAB  and  the  number  of  e-books  is  increasing  every  day.  To  promote  open  access,  copyright  and  plagiarism  issues should be addressed properly. Various forums are  available  to  discuss  all  these  issues.
