The purpose of the study is to identify the need of Media Information Literacy pedagogy in IITs through  model curriculum if, proposed across the programme and courses. In this regard a survey was conducted with a well  structured questionnaire for collection of data from targeted population with a sample of 1054 student of selected  IITs of Northern India. Findings of the study demonstrate that 25 per cent to 30 per cent students welcome MIL  curriculum for regular pedagogy. However, 60 per cent to 70 per cent students were of the opinion that MIL can  enhance their critical thinking abilities for evaluating media messages which help the students to survive and thrive  better in the digital world and prepares them for global communication and social participation.

1. IntroductIon  
In  recent  years,  media  and  information  literacy  (MIL)  has  been  increasingly  recognised  as  a  critical  component  of  academics  and  social  life.  UNESCO1  defned  “Media  and  Information Literacy is a set of competencies that empowers  citizens to access, retrieve, understand, evaluate and use, create  as well as share information and media content in all formats,  using  various  tools,  in  a  critical,  ethical,  and  effective  way,  in  order  to  participate  and  engage  in  personal,  professional,  and societal activities.” Rapid growth of media technologies  with multiple formats are changing landscape of the academic  teaching and learning. For engaging student in this environment,  students  need  critical  thinking  abilities  and  evaluating  skills  to effectively access, analyse, and use the information.  These  skills will help student to take informed decisions and form  opinions that can impact their academic as well as social life.  
Today, MIL has struggled to gain the momentum needed  to  become  part  of  the  students’  development  agenda.  The  present research work investigates the MIL and its ability to  enhance the critical thinking of students through proposition  of MIL curriculum in engineering courses. The study also tries  to  analyse  what  students  need  to  know  about  searching  for,  and  evaluating,  information,  and  how  teaching  and  learning  can  be  planned  and  carried  out  to  improve  MIL  skills.  The  study also tries to focus on the use of process-based inquiry  approaches  for  developing  Media  and  Information  Literacy  competence, involving students in active learning and open- ended investigations and emphasising their personal learning  process.

Media and information literacy has been evolved in the  recent years and has got a dramatic reach among students and  general people from all across the globe. It has been discussed  that introducing MIL curriculum keeps the students aware from  the adverse effect of media messages and builds the analytical  power  of  individual  to  evaluate  media  messages.  Student  irrespective  of  their  age,  gender  and  nationality,  these  days  rely  upon  media  and  its  technologies  to  access  information  from various media formats and keep themselves up-to-date  with  rapid  changing  technologies.  As  a  result  Media  and  Information Literacy curriculum is felt necessary components  in academic arena.   
1.1 Purpose  of  the  Study  
Most  of  the  media  and  information  related  research  problems are related to the children up to k-12 level. This study  is  focused  on  investigating  the  response  of  proposing  MIL  curriculum for integration into pedagogy in higher education. 
2. LIterature revIew 
Some  of  the  relevant  studies  are  worth  to  support  and  develop  insight  into  the  present  study.  Kim2   explained  in  his  study  that  undergraduates  are  very  dependent  on  media  oriented  information  and  have  the  competence  to  evaluate  the  media  messages  to  some  extent.  The  study  reveals  that  the  students  need  proper  guidance  and  training  to  tune  up  with  the  information  literacy  (IL)  standards  as  academic  librarians deemed appropriate the use and evaluation of media  information.  Jagtar  Singh3   described  that  the  information  literacy is important for sense making ability of the stakeholders  while he also emphasised that it should be intermingled with

the  new  media  technologies  and  formats  for  engaging  the  people for their lifelong learning to make them more media  informed  and  empowered  them  as  well.  Grizzle4   describes  that Media is the most powerful and ubiquitous in democratic  society and needs Media and Information Literacy (MIL) to use  it more effectively for young people particularly for students  through MIL educated teacher who should have pedagogical  competencies  regarding  teaching  and  lifelong  learning  to  educate and empowering the students to be more media literate  citizen for democratic society. Carolyn and Tessa5 expounded  the importance of connect learning in the media environment.  She  recommended  MIL  as  an  essential  ability  for  teachers  and  students  for  sustainable  development  in  the  networked  and  global  media  information  environment  to  achieve  the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of UNESCO.  
Jose and Alagaran6  describe that MIL should be integrated  in the communication curriculum and should be taught to the  students in such a way where education become more responsive  towards sustainable development goals through new conceptual  model of 3Es: Explore Engage and Empower. Students are the  future media practitioner they need to be updated to align with  the  new  media  technologies.  Teacher  should  take  MIL  as  a  class activity and help the students to make them engage with  new media exploration which empower them for sustainable  development through creation and sharing the media messages  Kalra7   emphasised  MIL  for  the  students  of  college  and  universities. As he consider that students from urban colleges  have  adequate  opportunities  to  access  the  Internet,  use  of  computer, laptop etc. He explained that Media and Information  Literacy University Network of India (MILUNI) established  by UNESCO in 2014 is taking initiative to develop MIL policy  and strategy for the development of MIL curriculum suited for  Indian education system at level of higher education.  
A  model  curriculum  prepared  by  the  members  of  MILUNI  has  been  accepted  by  the  INFLIBNET  and  digital  contents developed according uploaded on the portal. Author  is also giving due importance to MIL for higher education and  recommends it as qualitative paper for inter disciplinary course  in  post  graduate  programmes.  Mathur8   describes  systematic  growth and development of Media and Information Literacy  in South Asia particularly in India. He also emphasised that  MIL  is  soul  of  present  and  future  media  education. Author  also  revealed  that  MIL  curriculum  and  its  module  have  been  developed  by  the  Institute  of  Mass  Communication  (IIMC),  New  Delhi  and  the  digital  contents  for  National  aspirants  are  being  uploaded  on  e-pathshala  portal  which  is  hosted  on  INFLIBNET  website.  This  is  the  pilot  project  of  Indian  Government  on  the  recommendation  of  UNESCO.  Hobbs9   appraised  that  educators,  curriculum  developers  and  policymakers  must  consider  fve  challenges  when  implementing  programs  in  digital  and  media  literacy.  In  modern society media has an impact for empowering people  with  knowledge.  The  signifcance  of  being  information  and  media literate is to engage in a digital society; one needs to be  able to use, understand, inquire, create, communicate and think  critically. Ghosh10  et al., describes media literacy and media  education should be an integral part of the course curricula. A lack  of media curriculum causes people get a wrong understanding  
222 
of  all  the  media  information.  Livingstone11   describes  that  Media  Literacy  research  is  highly  multidisciplinary  and  associated  with  the  subjects  of  Social  sciences, Technology,  and  Information  science,  Skills  of  pedagogy  and  Computer  competencies.  He  also  added  that  policy  makers  are  trying  to scale down the problems to emancipate the academics for  promoting Media and Information Literacy.

4.  HyPotHeSIS 
There  is  no  signifcant  difference  with  respect  to  MIL  curriculum  based  pedagogy  between  the    programme  and  across the institutions. 
5.    r eSearcH   Met HodoLogy 
The present study is of a descriptive in nature and is based  on  the  primary  and  secondary  data. The  data  was  collected  through  structured  questionnaire  distributed  to  the  targeted  population of 22095 students of selected IITs (IIT Delhi, IIT  Kanpur and IIT Roorkee) of North India and a sample of 1054  students across the programme was collected by using stratifed  random  sampling  method. Collected  data  was  edited,  coded  and processed with the help of Statistical Package of Social  Science  (SPSS)  software  version  22.0  in   statistics,  analysis  of  Variance  (ANOVA)  was  used  to  evaluate  whether  there  are differences between the average value, and mean, across  several population groups. The chi-square (x2) was also used  to test the goodness of ft whether a signifcant difference exist  between the observed number of responses and an expected  number of responses based on the null hypothesis (H0) in each  category or class. 
6.   d ata anaLySIS  and  Inter PretatIonS 6.1  Proposition  of  MIL curriculum 
The  scale  reliability  results  for  proposition  of  MIL  curriculum is as shown in Table 1 the results show Cronbach’s  Alpha of 0.986. The results are valid as Cronbach’s Alpha must  be greater than or equal to 0.7. The mean of 8.4820 shows out  of 20 if all variables are loaded at Likert Scale 5. It explains  42.41 percent of the construct. It validates the content, face,  and discriminate validity. 
The respondents were asked whether the MIL curriculum  should be included in the course. Table 2 clearly indicate that  lowest  percentage  of  the  students  are  agreed  to  include  the  MIL curriculum in the course. This reveals that majority of the

A model curriculum of MIL has prepared by UNESCO  with  a  holistic  approach  having  modules  of  skills  and  competencies that is to be studied in schools, universities with  some modifcation according to the local variance for preparing  the  students  for  their  best  survival  and  thrival  in  the  digital  world. In this regard the respondents were asked whether MIL  curriculum should be implemented in all courses/programmes.  Table 2 exhibits that majority of the respondents were not frm  on the issue of MIL curriculum implementation. 
Engineering  programme  is  a  special  programme  especially  in  IITs  where  students  are  overburdened  due  to  profound curriculum of the course. In these circumstances an  additional proposal of MIL paper in optional mode is another  load  for  them.  Keeping  this  in  view,  the  respondents  were  asked whether the MIL curriculum should be introduced as an  optional paper to improve their critical thinking. Table 2 shows  that majority of the students keep silent on the issue of optional  paper of MIL.  
MIL is a composite concept and has comprehensive cross  curricular skills and competencies for enhancing digital abilities  and critical thinking of the students for the best survival in the  digital world. The respondents were asked whether the MIL  curriculum will be fruitful to enhance cross curricular skill of  the students. Table 2 shows that that majority of the students  discarded that the MIL curriculum hardly be helpful to improve  cross curricular skills of the students.

Table 3 shows that the calculated value of F of the level  MIL  curriculum  one  of  the  
the tabulated value of F, i.e. 3.84 at 0.05 level of signifcance.  Therefore, null hypothesis (H0) is rejected for these factors.  It is concluded that there is signifcant difference in the mean  of perceived level of MIL curriculum one of the component  of  pedagogy  and  differs  signifcantly  across  the  students  of  different programme (UG, PG and PhD) 
MIL  curriculum  one  of  the  components  of  pedagogy  response and chi-square for the students programme (UG, PG  and PhD) is shown in the Table 4. The results show that the  item group empower students responses - maximum preference  is for agree (61.4 %). Item group prepare students responses -  maximum preference is for agree (66.8 %). Item group media  democracy responses- maximum preference is for agree (70.0  %). Also, the chi-square is signifcant at level more than 95 per  cent. Hence, there is an agreement regarding applicability of  these variables of the study. 
Table 5 shows that the calculated value of F of the level MIL  curriculum one of the components of pedagogy with attributes  Empower  students  and  prepares  students  is  smaller  than  the  tabulated  value  of  F,  i.e.  3.84  at  0.05  level  of  signifcance.  Therefore, null hypothesis (H0) is accepted for these factors. It  is concluded that there is no signifcant difference in the mean  of perceived level of MIL curriculum one of the component  of  pedagogy  and  does  not  differs  signifcantly  across  the  institutions. However, attribute media democracy is greater than  the tabulated value of F, i.e. 3.84 at level of signifcance 0.05.  Therefore, null hypothesis (H0) is rejected for these factors. It  is concluded that there is signifcant difference in the mean of  perceived level of MIL curriculum one of the component of  pedagogy and differs signifcantly across the Institutions.MIL  curriculum one of the components of pedagogy response and  chi-square for across the Institutions (IIT Delhi, Roorkee and  Kanpur) is shown in the Table 4. The results show that item  group  empower  students  responses-  strongly  disagree  (15.4  %), Agree (61.4), Neutral (5.5 %), Disagree (12.0 %), strongly  disagree (5.8 %). Here maximum preference is for agree.  Item  group prepare students responses- strongly agree (13.9), agree  (66.8 %), Neutral (6.3 %), Disagree (8.7 %) strongly disagree  (4.4  %)  Here  maximum  preference  is  for  agree;  Item  group  media  democracy  responses-  strongly  agree  (14.3  %),  agree  (70.0%),    neutral  (3.9%),  disagree  (6.8%)  strongly  disagree

8.  ConClusions 
Traditional education is transforming rapidly into media  oriented  education  system.  Information  is  embedded  into  various  media  formats.  e.g  the  Internet,  television,  radio,  computer, kindles, multimedia, mobiles etc. The Internet has  revolutionised  the  whole  world.  Information  availability  has  become  easier  but  accessing  the  relevant  information  and  evaluating the media message into meaningful information is  very diffcult. In the report of new media consortium (NMC  2017),  Becker12   reported  that  technological  development  has  made  radical  change  in  higher  education  and  impacts  the teaching, learning and creative enquiry across the globe.  Education system can attain maturity by healthy co-existence  of media, technology, processes and people. The proposition  of MIL curriculum in this regard across the programme and  courses  has  its  benefts  in  higher  education.  Introduction  of  media and information literacy curriculum in higher education  system will help the students to improve their critical thinking  abilities  for  analysing,  evaluating  the  media  messages  to  survive and thrive better in the digital world and prepares them  for global communication and social participation.
