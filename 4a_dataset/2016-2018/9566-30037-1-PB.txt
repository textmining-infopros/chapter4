 Several aspects of knowledge management in R&D institutions have been studied and reported by researchers  in the past.  However, studies on the relevance of in-house publications have not been reported so far.  In-house  publications have a signifcant role to play in effective knowledge management, especially in large R&D institutions.   Such  institutions  generally  have  a  compartmentalised  structure,  wherein  each  compartment  delves  deeper  and  deeper into areas of their own interest and expertise. As the depth and detail of the subject under study increases  communication between the compartments becomes weaker. Dialogues within the compartments become jargon-ridden  and incomprehensible to those belonging to the other compartments. In organisations with thousands of employees,  distributed in several branches, situated in geographically distributed locations, communication of the knowledge  generated at one place to another pose lots of problems. In-house publications are one of instruments that seek to  correct this situation to a signifcant extent. To communicate the right information to the right people needs careful  handling of the subject at corporate level. Subsequently, the number of in-house publications may become quite  large.  This article presents the case of  Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory at Kochi, India, which resorts  to several in-house publications for effective knowledge management within the organisation.

1. INtROduCtION 
 Knowledge management (KM) is generally discussed  in  literature  in  business  contexts  wherein  knowledge  is  seen  as  a  tool  in  the  hands  of  commercially  operating  companies  to  deliver  their  products  and  services  more  effectively. The metric for effectiveness in such cases would  essentially follow the profit-and-loss account statements  of  the  company.  Several  authors  have  studied  the  KM  issues in the R&D department of such companies, in the  background  of  changes  in  the  business  environments.  Although  much  less  prevalent,  another  model  of  R&D  institutions also exist, wherein the R&D function and the  business (commercial) function are delinked and operate  independently.  Metrics  for  gauging  the  performance  of  the R&D function becomes more complex in such cases.  Obviously, such models can exist mostly in the government  sector, wherein the resources for the R&D activity come  from the public exchequer. To analyse the functioning of  these  kinds  of  organisations  it  is  meaningful  to  assume  that  knowledge  generation  itself  is  the  key  function  of  the  organisation.  The  KM  thus  becomes  a  much  more  important  aspect  of  running  the  organisation.  
Several methods are adopted for KM in R&D institutions,  including  those  in  the  government  sector  mentioned  above.  Issuing  of  periodical  in-house  publications  is  one among these. Although several aspects of KM have  been  studied  in  detail  by  various  authors  in  the  past,  the  specific  role  of  in-house  publications  seem  to  have  
Received 11 May 2016, online published 30 September 2016 
gone  un-noticed.  In  this  paper,  an  attempt  is  made  to  bring  out  the  relevance  of  in-house  publications  in  the  KM of R&D organisations in the government sector, by  making a case-study of Naval Physical and Oceanographic  Laboratory  (NPOL),  Kochi.

Several  aspects  of  KM  in  R&D  organisations  have  been  studied  and  reported  earlier.  Almost  all  of  these  are  from  the  commercial  world,  in  the  sense  that  the  R&D organisation under study is part of a commercially  operating company. The background for studying the KM  issues  are  of  commercial  nature  –  such  as  ‘intensified  competition, a splintered mass market, shortened product  life  cycles,  and  advanced  technology  and  automation,  etc.’  Drongelen,1 et  al.,  have  reviewed  these  several  years back. The activity of the R&D department is seen  as  “information  transformation  processes,  transforming  information  about  client  orders,market  demands  and  technological  advancements,  into  product  and  process  designs as observed by Souder2. Nederhof3, et al.  states   that  improvements  in  R&D  activity  can  be  brought  out  by  improving  the  quality  of  the  information  inputs,  or  by enhancing the ability of the R&D function to convert  information  into  quantifiable  outputs.  A  major  part  of  such information inputs needed for developing products  and  processes  are  assumed  to  be  available  within  the  company,  “stored  in  the  minds  of  people,  in  archives,  in  procedures,  in  equipment,  etc.”  Drongelen4,  et  al.,

have  made  detailed  analysis  of  the  KM  issues  in  such  contexts. 
Nonaka5   has  identified  four  modes  of  knowledge  creations such as socialisation, extenalisation, internalisation  and combination. Publications are means of externalisation  of knowledge and they contain explicit knowledge which  can be well-organised and kept for future reference. This  is  valid  for  all  kinds  of  organisations,  including  R&D  and  therefore  assumes  a  lot  of  importance  in  the  whole  gamut  of  KM.  However,  there  is  not  much  literature  available  on  the  specific  role  of  publications  in  KM.   
two branches of the organisation meet, they have mainly  non-technical  matters  to  discuss.  In-house  publications  are  one  of  the  instruments  that  correct  this  situation  to  a  significant  extent.  
In organisations with thousands of employees, distributed  in  several  branches  situated  in  various  geographical  locations, communication of the knowledge generated at  one  place  to  another  poses  lot  of  problems.  Obviously,  everybody  need  not  know  everything.  To  communicate  the  right  information  to  the  right  people  needs  careful  handling of the subject at corporate level. Subsequently,  
Ermine6   stated  that  “some  knowledge  is  codified  in  the  number  of  in-house  publications  may  become  quite  new records (publications, reports, documents etc.), it is large.  In  the  following  sub-sections,  the  significance  of  explicit  knowledge”.  He  also  stated  that  “the  necessary in-house  publications  in  the  case  of  a  Naval  Physical  reference  documentation  consists  of: The  documents  on and  Oceanographic  Laboratory  (NPOL),  India  was  organisation (missions, organisational charts, descriptions of examined.

scientists work in these institutions. NPOL is situated in  
Kochi, Kerala, and is one of the three laboratories working  
reported a few years back by Ravi7. It is stated that “In  R&D organisations, like in any other knowledge creation  process, only a part of the new knowledge gets recorded  in  documents  and  becomes  explicit  knowledge  which  others can refer to for enhancing their own knowledge”.  The  study  looks  at  the  communication  of  the  hard-core  technical  knowledge  that  gets  created  through  the  R&D  activity.  
In-house publications are of a different category by  itself  and  are  not  confined  to  technical  knowledge.  As  Kalam8  puts it,“Knowledge in any form, tacit or explicit,  is important. The future world would be dominated only  by  knowledge.”  The  KM  requires  capturing  of  tacit  knowledge  of  the  organisation  gained  and  built  through  years of experience. “Tacit knowledge has to be captured  by proper documentation, through mentoring, interviews  and surveys.”9   Since  all  are  not  expected  to  capture  all  the  knowledge  around,  documentation  should  be  such  that the required information only reaches the respective  persons.  In-house  publications  take  ample  care  of  this  aspect.In-house publications have a significant role to play  in  effective  KM,  especially  in  large  R&D  institutions.  R&D  institutions,generally,  have  a  compartmentalised  structure,  wherein  each  compartment  goes  deeper  and  deeper into areas of their own interest and expertise. As  the depth and detail of the subject under study increases  communication  between  the  compartments  becomes  weaker.  Dialogues  within  the  compartments  become  jargon-ridden and incomprehensible to those belonging to  the  other  compartments. As  the  size  of  the  organisation  becomes bigger, compartmentalisation becomes too tight  and  what  remains  common  between  the  employees  get  restricted to their service matters.

Nearly  one-fourth  of  this  is  women  employees.  The core strength of NPOL is in the area of design and  development of underwater surveillance systems. Systems  designed by NPOL get manufactured by large production  agencies  such  as  Bharat  Electronics  Limited  (BEL),  Larsen  &  Tubro  Limited  (L&T),  etc.,  who  sub-contract  several  smaller  companies  for  component  manufacture.  Indian Navy has fitted a large number of NPOL-designed  surveillance  systems  on  board  naval  vessels,  which  are  known  to  be  performing  very  well.  Its  current  annual  expenditure  is  about  1.25  billion  Indian  Rupees.  
NPOL has used in-house publications as very effective  tool  for  knowledge  management. There  are  at  least  five  different  levels  of  in-house  publications,  which  seek  to  cater  for  different  groups  of  people  and  therefore  have  different levels of contents and presentation styles. Figure  1  illustrates  the  reach  of  each  of  these  publications.

5.  MethOdOLOgy 
The present study is confined mainly to the scientists  and technical officers of the Naval Physical & Oceanographic  Laboratory, Kochi. The study was based on survey method  and questionnaires were used as the tool to collect data.  A structured questionnaire was designed, keeping in view  the basic objectives of the study. Separate questionnaires  were designed for each publication. Surveys were conducted  among the readers, to assess the relevance and usefulness  of these publications. Major conclusions of these surveys  are  presented  in  this  paper.  
The  in-house  publications  brought  out  regularly  by  NPOL  were  selected  for  the  study.    
6.  IN-hOuSe PubLICAtIONS Of  NPOL 
At NPOL the publications which are brought out in  regular  intervals  are  known  by  the  following  names: (1) Internal  notes  
(2) Research  Reports 
(3) Technical  Journal 
(4) Bulletin  
(5) Hindi  publications  
6.1  Internal  Notes  
Internal  notes  issued  within  a  working  group  or  division  viz.,  ‘Division  notes’  is  probably  the  zeroth  level of in-house publications. This is meant for a small  group of 10-30 people and would, in general, discuss the  subject  in  a  fair  amount  of  detail.  The  group  generally  has a similar background and experience, say mechanical  engineering,  analytical  chemistry,  etc.,  Groups  would  consist  of  different  teams,  working  on  different  type  of  tasks.  Since  all  the  working  teams  remain  busy  in  
their  own  work,  it  is  difficult  for  them  to  get  to  know  what their other colleagues are doing. Internal notes are  excellent devices to bridge this gap. Figure. 2 shows the  cover page of a division note from NPOL. This is issued  monthly  and  contains  full  details  of  all  the  technical  work  being  done  by  the  different  working  teams  under  the division. Circulation is restricted to within the group.  The  contents  are  reviewed  by  the  Division  Head  and  number  of  pages  are  generally  20-30. 
figure 2. Internal Note. 
Internal notes are very useful as work records of all  the  division  members.  Each  division  member  becomes  aware  of  what  the  other  members  are  working  on  and  how  fast/slow  others  are  progressing.  This  induces  a  small degree of competition among the division members,  which,  in  turn  results  in  documenting  each  and  every  little  piece  of  work  done  by  them.  This  is  important  for  posterity-a  small  piece  of  work  initiated  today  and  left  inconclusive  may  turn  out  to  be  great  importance  in  future.  Unless  it  is  properly  documented,  efforts  will  be  wasted  in  re-inventing  the  wheels 
Another  important  aspect  of  the  Division  Notes  is  that  it  makes  all  the  division  members  aware  of  other  member’s work. This is very much required at the end of  the year, when annual performance appraisals are carried  out. When everybody knows what others have achieved,  each person evolves a mental picture of themselves, relative  to  the  others.  This  facilitates  in  easier  acceptance  of  performance appraisal feedbacks. Moreover, to implement  concepts like ‘360-degrees feedback’ wherein everybody  is  asked  to  evaluate  everyone  else  in  the  division,  all  are  required  to  have  a  fair  amount  of  understanding  of  other’s work. Division Notes facilitates this. At least one  division in NPOL has made good use of the internal notes  as instruments for dissemination of knowledge generated  in  different  research  efforts  among  peers.

DJLIT, VOL.  36,  NO.  5, SEPTEMBER   2016 
The  survey  was  conducted  among  total  employees  (22)  of  a  single  group  and  the  results  indicated  that  the  internal notes do serve the intended purpose of knowledge  dissemination  within  the  group.  72  %    respondents  said  that  they  speed-read  all  the  articles  appearing  in  the  Division Notes. 58 % said that the Division Notes helped  them in effectively participating in reviews and 86 % said  that  they  could  do  a  fair  job  in  providing  ‘360  degrees  feedback’ because of the Division Notes. Although there  are  different  perceptions  about  looks  and  periodicity  of  the  document,  its  usefulness  was  acclaimed  by  a  large  percentage  of  the  division  members.  
6.2  Research  Reports 
Next  level  of  in-house  publications  at  NPOL  is  the  Research  Reports  (RRs).  These  are  also  fully  technical  and  released  in  a  formal  manner  after  refereeing  by  experts,  approval  from  the  highest  authority  etc.  The  contents  of  the  RRs  are  sufficiently  descriptive,  with  proper  introduction,  etc.  so  that  readers  from  various  backgrounds  can  comprehend  easily.  However,  it  is  not  meant  for  a  person  who  is  new  in  the  area.  Figure  3  shows  an  example  cover  page  of  a  Research  Report.  Research  Reports  contain  the  ultimate  essence  of  the  R&D  efforts  being  made  in  the  laboratory.  Number  of  pages  are  generally  between  20-50. 
figure 3. Research Report. 
The usefulness of RRs is mainly as reference documents  
in  a  later  note,  which  is  not  generally  the  case  with  RRs.  Since  the  users  of  RRs  are  mainly  scientists,  a  survey  was  conducted  among  scientists.  A  sample  of  100  scientists  which  comprises  41  %  of  total  scientists  of  NPOL  were  selected.  The  results  showed  that  about  75  %  know  that  RRs  are  available  online  in  Technical  Information  Resource  Centre  (TIRC)  portal  but  the  preference  for  reading  is  hard  copy.  85  %  respondents  said  that  they  read  at  least  one  RR  in  a  year.  35  %  do  not read RRs fully; they read only the chapters/sections  relevant  to  their  work.  60  %  said  that  the  RRs  helped  them in carrying out their assignments, while 30 % were  not  sure  about  it.  
6.3 technical journal 
Another  level  of  technical  communication  needs  to  take  place  between  the  internal  notes  and  RRs.  NPOL’s  half-yearly  technical  journal,  ‘Sea  Tech ’  caters  this  requirement. It is a bi-annual journal, released as a general  issue  and  as  a  special  issue  focusing  on  the  activities  in  a  particular  area.  ‘Sea  Tech ’  captures  some  of  the  important  technical  achievements  from  different  groups  and  presents  in  a  concise  form,  omitting  the  elaborate   ones.  These  are  also  refereed  documents  and  hence  authentic.  This  is  a  peer-reviewed  journal.  The  journal  helps  the  authors  to  increase  their  ability  in  writing  research articles while other employees of NPOL get an  opportunity  to  read  about  the  work  of  their  colleagues.  No. of pages are generally 50-60. All the journal issues  are  made  online  through  intranet. 
for system designers and researchers. Since these documents  come  with  detailed  introduction  and  also  undergoing  a  refereeing  process,  they  are  sufficiently  authentic  to  be  referred  and  quoted.  It  can  be  noted  here  that  internal  notes are more of work records and results therein cannot  be  directly  used  by  others,  without  cross-checking  with  the authors. It is quite likely that a particular conclusion  made in a note has been changed/modified significantly

‘Sea Tech’ is accessible (on request) to other DRDO  laboratories as well. Figure 4 shows cover page of one of  the issues of ‘Sea Tech’. Authorship pattern and number  of articles published in each Sea Tech  illustrated in Fig.  5. The graph clearly shows that the scientists understood  the importance of knowledge sharing and more and more  articles were published in the journal. Number of authors  also  have  increased  over  time.  
A  sample  of  225  scientists  and  technical  officers  was  selected  considering  the  fact  that  they  are  the  user  community  for  the  journal  which  comprises  of  46  %  of  total  scientists  and  technical  officers  of  NPOL.  The  survey results showed that the preferred way of reading  ‘Sea  Tech’  is  hard  copy  for  80  %  of  the  respondents  even though 90 % know that ‘Sea Tech’  is  available  in  TIRC  portal.  70  %  of  the  respondents  were  aware  of  the  impact  of  publishing  their  articles  in  ‘Sea  Tech’  on  their career prospects. The survey also showed that about  30 % of the respondents have published their articles in  Sea  Tech   and  70  %  have  not  yet  published. 
6.4 bulletin  (Non-technical  Publication) 
Knowledge,  in  an  organisational  setting,  is  not  only  technical,  even  in  the  case  of  R&D  organisations.  The  type  and  variety  of  non-technical  activities  being  undertaken in an organisation reflects the progress of the  organisation. Without communicating this, the organisational  communication remains incomplete. At NPOL, the half- yearly  bulletin,  ‘Sea  State’  (Fig.  6)  is  released  towards  meeting this objective. The contents are mostly general-main  events that happen in the laboratory, visits, celebrations  etc.  Some  of  the  technical  achievements,  which  can  be  readily  appreciated  by  common  man,  are  also  included.  This  is  distributed  to  DRDO  Headquarters  as  well  as  all  other  DRDO  laboratories. The Sea  State   is  released  in  Hindi  also,  to  ensure  wider  readership.  Contents  of  Sea  State   are  reviewed  and  edited  by  Director  and  the  Editorial  Board.  Number  of  pages  are  generally  10-20. 
A  sample  of  177  employees  including  scientists,  technical  officers  and  administrative  staff  was  selected  as  this  is  a  general  publication.  This  is  about  30  %  of  total population of NPOL. 75 % of the respondents said  
figure 6. Sea State  bulletin. 
that   Sea  State  is  where  one  can  see  all  NPOL  news  at  one  place.  56  %  said  that  they  read  all  the  articles  in  Sea  State,  while  25  %  said  that  they  read  only  those  sections  that  they  find  interesting.  
6.5 hindi  Publications 
In  all  communications  at  NPOL,  Hindi  assumes  an  important  role,  since  it  has  been  identified  as  the  language of the administration (Raj Bhasha). Newsletters  and  annual  magazines  in  Hindi  are  released  with  the  specific  objective  of  promoting  Hindi  as  an  official  language. NPOL’s Hindi newsletter is ‘Pavan’  which  is  half  yearly  and  annual  magazine  is  ‘Lahar’.  These  are  platforms  for  expression  of  artistic  and  literary  talents  of  the  larger  NPOL  community,  which  includes  the  family members of the employees also. From the family  members  of  the  security  staff  right  upto  the  associate  directors, all the members of the NPOL family show their  presence  in Lahar.  ‘Pavan’  is  a  newsletter  designed  to  disseminate information regarding the specific initiatives  taken  up  for  promotion  of  Raj  Bhasha.  Figure  7  shows  the cover pages of issues of ‘Pavan’ and ‘Lahar’. Hindi  publications  are  reviewed  and  edited  by  the  Hindi  Cell,  NPOL  and  additional  checking  is  done  by  an  external  language  expert. Pavan   is  typically  less  than  10  pages  where Lahar   runs  into  60-90  pages. 
Survey  was  conducted  among  all  employees  and  the  sample  covered  is  150  employees  which  comprise

25  percent  of  total  population.  67  %  of  the  respondents  said that Hindi publications help to promote use of Hindi  as an official language. The respondents also considered  the Hindi publications as recreational material. 40 % of  the  respondents  have  contributed  to  these  publications  at  least  once. The  survey  results  also  showed  that  more  than  93  %  of  readers  prefer  hardcopy  to  read.  
7.  CONCLuSIONS 
Although several aspects of knowledge management  in  R&D  organisations  have  been  earlier  studied  by  researchers  in  the  past,  the  role  and  impact  of  internal  publications  have  not  been  studied  and  reported  earlier.  In  this  study,  an  attempt  is  made  to  assess  the  role  of  internal publications in a particular R&D organisation, viz.,  Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory. Previous  works  related  to  this  have  been  briefly  reviewed  in  the  introduction.  Relevant  details  regarding  the  laboratory  have  been  mentioned.  Structured  surveys  have  been  carried  out  among  members  of  the  organisation  to  get  a  quantified  idea  of  the  role  of  the  different  internal  publications.  Results  have  brought  out  that  there  is  a  significant  role  for  the  internal  publications  in  the  knowledge management in the organisation. Although it  was not included explicitly in the surveys, the respondents  of  the  surveys  also  provided  an  input  as  to  which  area  of the organisational activity was still not covered by the  existing publications. Accordingly, it was suggested that  another publication, specifically covering the management  aspects,  also  shall  be  brought  out.  
As future research work, it is proposed that studies  of the role and relevance of internal publications in larger  R&D  organisations  may  be  taken  up  and  attempts  can  be  done  to  quantitatively  relate  this  to  the  performance  parameters  of  the  organisation.
