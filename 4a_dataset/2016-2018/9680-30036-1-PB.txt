ABSTRACT 
The present article focuses on the impact of new technology on the library services. The basic theme is based  on the use of technology in the academic institutes. The article also highlights the major points like impact of  automation/technology on print sources, staff, infrastructure, space, etc. The data collected shows the impact on  services like reference and xeroxing. As the change demands lots of funds, so the data is collected to know the  impact of technology on various sections of the library. The article also highlights the role of authority/management  to generate sources and services. The article concluded that the change should be accepted due to the positive  
updates shown in the library. 
Keywords: Technology, services, electronic services, libraries, technology impact 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
Now a days it is very difficult to assume living without  the use of computer/technology. In this technological era,  computers  are  being  used  in  every  sphere  of  life,  like,  communication,  searching  information,  handling  data,  collection, preservation, and calculation of figures, etc.,  and  have  become  the  essential  sources  which  are  found  to  be  helpful  and  error  free  to  handle  various  complex  operation of day to day life. The traditional print sources  now a days are replaced with the electronic sources and  users  are  more  orientated  toward  the  new  techniques  of  information  retrieval.  Libraries  are  required  to  update  themselves and their users with the new and recent ways  of  learning  and  dream  toward  libraries  to  open  access  with  no  walls,  i.e.,  libraries  without  boundaries.  Many  library  resources  are  now  available  electronically  and  can  be  accessed  via  the  Web.  The  change  of  moving  from print to the electronic media to access information  directly  or  indirectly  affects  the  various  sources  and  services  which  are  of  traditional  use.  
2.  REVIEW  OF  LITERATURE 
A large number of research papers have been published  on  this  topic.  Study  by  Singh1   revealed  that  internet,  intranet, www, web directories, web portals, and e-portals  etc.,  have  great  impact  on  the  libraries  and  information  centres.  The  new  emerging  technology  like  e-journals,  e-books, e-databases, search engines, portals are playing  very active role in acquisition and dissemination of full-  text  information  in  the  libraries  at  a  minimal  cost.  
Baljinder & Verma2  had conducted the survey on the  
use of e-resources and services at the Central Library of  Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. The study showed  that most of the users (88 %) were aware of the e-resources  and  services.  Only  36.76  %  of  the  users  were  using  the  library  e-resources  occasionally  and  33.22  %  used  2/3  times  a  week.  71%  preferred  to  use  both  print  and  electronic formats, 17.45% electronic only, and 11.52 %  print only. This study also indicated that the users were  accessing  these  resources  from  hostels  and  departments  more as compared to the library resulting in the decrease  of  users’  visits  to  the  library. 
The study conducted by Sathiyamurthy & Aravinthan3 revealed  that  internet  has  great  impact  on  the  students  of  4  BEd  Educational  Colleges  in  Cuddalore  District,  viz., Annai Madha College of Education, D.V.C. College  of  Education,  Sri  Viruthambigai  College  of  Education,  Vivekananda College of Education, College of Education.  Students  of  these  four  colleges  were  evaluated  on  their  awareness and use of library resources and services through  the  questionnaire  comprising  questions  on  preference  of  internet  search  engines,  awareness  about  attending  conferences,  seminars  and  workshops,  use  of  internet  discussion  forums  or  newsgroups,  conversation  with  library staff, use of indexing journals, library catalogues,  publishes  catalogue  and  flyers,  use  of  book  reviews,  browsing the collections in libraries, use of bibliography,  list  of  servers  and  e-mail  alerts,  media:  TV,  adio  and  newspapers  subject  specific  software,  consultation  with  experts  in  the  field,  use  of  electronic  database,  current  awareness  services  of  libraries,  use  of  website  as  book  store,  abstract  journal,  reprints  received  from  authors/ publishers.

3.  SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES 
Jalandhar is the oldest city in Punjab, and also one  of the oldest in the country. Jalandhar was the capital of  Punjab from India's independence (1947) until Chandigarh  was  built  in  1953.  The  scope  of  the  study  is  limited  to  academic  institutions  of  Jalandhar  Distinct  as  with  the  development,  the  use  of  technology  has  enhanced  in  every  sphere  of  life.  The  institutes  considered  under  study  are  as  follows:  
(a) Lyallpur  Khalsa  College  for  Boys,  Jalandhar  (b) Lyallpur  khalsa  College  for  women,  Jalandhar (c) Doaba  College,  Jalandhar  
(d) DAV  College,  Jalandhar 
(e) KMV  College,  Jalandhar 
(f) Lyallpur  Khalsa  College  for  Management (g) Lyallpur  Khalsa  College  for  Engineering (h) S.D.  College  for Women  
(i) BD Arya  College  for Women 
(j) Apeejay  College  of  Fine Art 
(k) Apeejay  College  for  Management 
The  study  focuses  on  the  use  of  technology  in  the  academic  institutes  libraries.  This  change  requires  lots  of  amendments  and  funds  in  comparison  to  the  existing  system.  So,  it  is  necessary  to  evaluate  the  change  with  reference  to  services  and  sources  to  user  and  the  major  question raised while this transformation is ‘What influence  e-media  has  on  traditional  libraries  in  terms  of  various  components  like  services,  spacing,  staffing,  resources,  etc,’  This  survey  was  conducted  to  fulfill  these  queries  and  to  access  its  impact  on  the  various  components  of  the  libraries. 
The  main  objective  of  the  study  is  to  assess  the  impact  of  e-resources  in  terms  of  resources,  staffing,  space, technical services, and equipment in the academic  intuitions  libraries. 
4.  METHODOLOGY 
Questionnaire technique was used. Thirty questionnaires  were distributed among professionals (librarians/assistant  librarians/ library professionals) to the above mentioned  academics  institutions  of  Jalandhar  District  and  out  of  them  22  questionnaire  were  received  back.  
5.  DATA ANALYSIS AND  FINDINGS 
5.1 Availability/accessibility  of  E-resources

This shows that consortium  plays the lead role in accessing the authentic information  which  is  not  available  in  free  access  on  internet.
