University Grants Commission (UGC) listed more than 38,000 journals based on three databases, Web of  Science, Scopus and Indian Citation Index for selection/promotion of teachers and other academic staff in the  universities and colleges, in India. The frst covers 15 journals in the area of Library and Information Science which  are published from India. This study provides comprehensive information of those journals with the objectives of  critically studying on the aspects such as: reviewed/refereed/coverage in abstracting and indexing in databases,  journal ranking and updateness of the journal. The list of LIS Journals presently available on the UGC website  
is reviews.

1.  IntROdUCtIOn 
There is a phenomenal growth of library and information  science journals during last one decade. The study by Dutta and  Sen describes that during last 100 years in all 186 periodicals  have been published from India out of which 60 periodicals  started during 2011-141, which indicates that about one-third of  total periodicals started only during this period of fve years. The  possible reason could be linking publications with the career  progression of library and information professionals working  in  higher  education  system  in  the  country. While  looking  at  the  background  the  University  Grants  Commission  (UGC)  Regulations of 19982 prescribed a fx number of publications  and  thereafter  introduction  of  academic  performance  indicator  (API)  for  selection  and  promotion  of  teachers  and  librarians in the ‘UGC regulations on minimum qualifcations  for  appointments  of  teachers  and  other  academic  staff  in  universities and colleges and measures for the maintenance of  standards in higher education 2010’ linked publications with  the recruitment and career progression.  
The  Regulations  2010  prescribes  various  activities  for  counting of APIs, namely:  Teaching, learning and evaluation  related  activities;  Co-curricular,  extension  and  professional  development  related  activities;  and  research  and  academic  contribution.  In  the  category  ‘Research  and  Academic  Contributions’  various  areas  are  included,  namely:  Research  papers  published  in  refereed  journal;  Research  publications  (books, chapters in books, other than refereed journal articles);  Research projects; Research guidance; and Training courses and  conferences/seminars/workshop papers. The UGC notifcation  No.F.1-2/2016  (PS)  Amendments,  dated  10  January  20173 comprising  of  a  list  of  38652  journals  across  the  subjects,  
Received : 08 March 2017, Revised : 25 September 2017  Accepted : 15 December 2017, Online published : 01 January 2018 
mentions that the list is dynamic and may be reviewed from time  to time. Through the amendment the UGC decided to compile  the list in view of complaints that academics were publishing  in sub-standard, and sometimes paid for publications4. 
These  journals  are  from  all  branches  of  knowledge  and covers large number of journals published from foreign  countries. There was no source giving  consolidated information  of the Indian library and information science journals covered  in the UGC list5.In thisstudy, authors tried to review the Indian  LIS journals which are covered in the list and various aspects  of the regulations for the journal articles published by teachers,  namely  ISSN,  reviewed/refereed/abstracted  and  indexed  in  databases, journal ranking and updateness of journals.

POIntS 
The  UGC  Regulations  20106,  and  thereafter  four  amendments  in  the  Regulations  have  been  brought  out  to  make the APIs effectively operational. The weightage  of API  for  journal  publications  in  the  UGC  Regulations  2010  and  amendment Regulations of 20167  is summarised in the Table 1. 
Table  1  makes  it  clear  that  there  are  changes  in  the  weightage in API in 2010 and the fourth Amendment of 2016  in regard to maximum points for refereed journals (from 15  points to 25 points); papers with impact factor between 1 and 2  and between 5 and 10; and non-refereed journals.   
3. CRItICISm Of the  UGC  LISt Of  
JOURnALS 
UGC has taken a bold step to bring research publications  of the Indian teachers and research community in the legitimate  and  high  standard  journals  but  the  proposed  list  received  criticism from higher education community in the social media  and press and media on many grounds including:

* The University shall identify journals and will be approved by the UGC, may also recommend journals for inclusion in the list. 
- It excludes many reputed Indian journals and also journals  
in Hindi and regional languages. 
- It  arranges  alphabetically  irrespective  of  subject  and  
discipline which makes it user-unfriendly. 
- It denotes journals of one subject in other subjects/faculties  
which  creates  confusion  and  does  not  help  teachers  in  
developing a list of journals for any particular subject. - It covers multiple occurrences of many titles. 
- It covers large number of titles which have been ‘Inactive’  
titles from the Scopus source list.   
In  communication  of  30  January  20178   from  the  UGC,  requested all the universities to submit the list of journals for  the inclusion in the UGC list.  
4.  ObJeCtIveS And methOdOLOGy Of  the  
StUdy 
- To provide information about the library and information  
science journals published from India covered in the UGC  
list; and 
- To  discuss  aspects  such  as  ISSN,  reviewed/refereed,  
coverage  in  abstracting and  indexing  databases,  journal  
ranking  and  updateness  for  the  journals  covered  in  the  
list.  
It  is  essential  to  know  the  details  of  the  Library  and  Information Science journals published from India which are  covered in the UGC list. A comprehensive analysis of these   journals  would  help  the  potential  contributors  for  making  appropriate  decisions  for  publications  in  the  Indian  LIS  journals to facilitate their selection and career progression in  universities  and  colleges  by  attaining APIs  as  per  the  UGC  Regulations. Also briefy reviews the list of the LIS Journals  available on the UGC website as on 20 October 2017. 
Table  2  gives  country-wise  distribution  of  the  journals  covered in the UGC list9. Table represents that India is the third  country  after  USA  and  UK  in  the  country-wise  distribution  of journals published and covered in the list. 15 Library and  Information  Science  Journals  published  from  India  covered  in  the  UGC  List  are  mentioned  in  the Annexure-1. This  list  excludes  journal  entry  with  multiple  names/occurrences  with  earlier  name  (e.g.  DESIDOC  Journal  of  Information  technology);  journal  entry  with  ‘Library’  as  subject  in  the  UGC list while belonging to others subject (e.g. Electronics  
50 
and Information Planning) as it is covered in Engineering (with  class  number  621.38  as  per  UDC  Classifcation  scheme)  in  ISSN database and the broad subject Engineering sub-category  Electrical and Electronic Engineering as per Scimago10. 
The following sources were consulted and used for getting  maximum information relating to every individual journal: - Ulrich International Periodicals Directory 
- ISSN Database 
- Source list(s) from and information Citation databases like  
Scopus, Web of Science, Indian citation Index, Scimago,

5.    dISCUSSIO nS 
(a). Journals  are  the  most  important  research  outlets  for  
earning  APIs  for  teachers  and  librarians.  The  column  
three of the Table 1 indicates the points given to a journal  
and periodical publication (both for refereed and reputed)  
and  additional  points  for  having  ISSN,  indexed  and  
impact  factor  as  incorporated  in  the  UGC  Regulations  
2010. Fourth amendment in the Regulations excludes the  
word periodicals from journals and periodicals. However,  
universities  follow  different  pattern  on  the  matter  of  
inclusion of journals/periodicals; publications in free/paid  
journals, etc.11-13. 
(b). Subject  prescribed  in  the  UGC  List:  The  list  indicates  
different  subjects  for  the  journals  and  one  such  subject  
‘library’  is  covered.  The  journals  covered  in  the  
subject  ‘library’  do  not  denote  an  accepted  subject.  
The  accepted  subject  may  include  ‘library  science’,  
‘library  and  information  science’.  Looking  at  the  list,  
the journal ‘Annals of Library and Information Studies’  
is  covered  in  computer  science  in  place  of  library  and  
information  science.  The  journal  ‘Digital  Information  
Management’  is  covered  in  business,  management  and  
accounting;  computer  science;  and  social  sciences. The  
journal ‘DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information  
Technology’ is covered in ‘library’ as per the ICI while  
covered in ‘social science’  as per the Scopus List.   (c). Referring  or  reviewing  process  of  the  Journals:  If  the  
journal  is  refereed,  a  teacher  gets  more  weightage  in  
the  API  score  for  his/her  publication.  The  frequently  
used terms include: refereed/peer reviewed. There is no  
standard procedure to follow for referring/review process.  
In some journals the editorial team members are involved  
in referring/review process while in others the editor takes  
the responsibility to get reviewed/refereed by experts in  
the area. Sometimes mix of the two takes place. In special  
issue on any particular theme, the guest editor takes such  
responsibility.  
All the journals are refereed or reviewed. Many of these  have  highlighted  such  information  on  the  cover  page  of  the  journal. However if a comparison of the pre API and post API  period is made, one can fnd that it was not practice in pre-API  era.    
(d). ISSN: Studies on increase in the number of journals having  
ISSN mention that ‘One of the reasons for the phenomenal  
increase during 2006 to 2015 in the number of journals  
seeking ISSNs is linking of journals with API. A journal  
with ISSN used to have more weightage in the API score  
of the UGC’s ‘minimum qualifcations for appointments  
of teachers and other academic staff in universities and  
colleges and measures for the maintenance of standards  
in higher education 2010’14-16.  
Although in the 4th  amendment, the UGC has eliminated  the ISSN link with the journal publication may be due to the  reason  that  acquiring  ISSN  is  customary  for  any  reputed  or  refereed journals. ‘The ISSN is a standard identifer for serials  
(e.g., journals, magazines, newsletters, newspapers, annuals)  whether published in print, online or other media. Each medium  version is assigned a separate ISSN’ means online and printed  versions  of  a  journal  are  required  to  have  separate  ISSN17.  While studying ISSN of journals, it is noticed that: All the 15  listed journals have ISSN, with 7 print only journals; 8 journals  print and online (e-ISSN) both; and none of journal is available  exclusive  online.  The  print  journal  ‘Digital  Information  Management’ does not have e-ISSN while content is available  full text online of the period 2010-2016. The journal makes a  mention of the print ISSN on the webpage of the journal.   (e). Editor  and  Editorial  Board  affliations:  Many  of  the  
factors contribute for establishing reputation of the journal  
including ISSN. Though ISSN is simply an identifer for  
the journal title and does not in any way contribute to the  
reputation/ quality of the journal. The editor and editorial  
board affliations of the journal can signifcantly raise the  
reputation of the journal.  The practice for editorial board  
in the journals varies as mentioned below: 
- 12 journals have more than 10 members in the editorial  
board/committee whereas 2 journals have less than 10  
members in editorial board. One journal does not have  
editorial board.  
- There is one or more members from foreign countries  
in 6 Journals. 
- 7  journals  have  more  than  one  member  from  one  
organisation. 
- 9  journals  have  not  mentioned  full  affliation  of  
editorial board members.  
- 3 journals do not have proper editorial page.  
Although, the guidelines for requesting an ISSN through  the  National  centre  of  ISSN,  India  prescribes  that  editorial  boards with complete addresses of the editorial board members  including email address of the members and full contact address  of publisher with publisher name should be displayed on the  journal website. The journal should have a valid URL address  and should cover a precise subject or address a specifc target  audience. Further the guidelines state that the journal should  have a proper editorial page with affliation of editor(s) 
 18 
. 
Reputations of the organisations which run the journals  also contribute to the prestige of the journal. When looked at  the sponsoring body, 2 journals are govt. publication, 4 journals  are association’s publication, 7 journals are private publication  (NGO, foundation etc.), 1 journal is university publication and  1 journal is individual publication. 
(f). Online  Access  to  the  Journals:  In  recent,  journals  are  
fully/partly  migrating  to  the  online  mode/platforms  for  
easier access to the journal content. 9 of the 15 journals  
are available online. The complete picture of the journals  
in regard to online availability is presented in the Table 3.  (g). Coverage in abstracting/Indexing Databases/Directories:  
A  journal  gets  recognition  by  many  ways  including  
coverage and listing in various subject based indexing and  
abstracting databases. It gives visibility to the journal and  
is useful in making bibliographies and bibliometric studies.  
LISTA,  LISA  and  Library  Literature  and  Information  
Science Index are popular databases in the subject20,21,22.  
However,  individual  journal  gives  description  of  the

(h). Ranking of Journals: Ranking of a journal in the scientifc  
community is decided on the basis of the impact of the  
published papers. In other words how the journal papers  
are cited over a period of time by others will be the impact  
of  the  journal.  Citation  tools  have  different  criteria  for  
calculating  impact  of  the  journals.  The  following  table  
gives a picture of the journal ranking from three sources,  
namely:  Google  Scholar,  Scimago,  Indian  Citation  
Index23,24:  
In  the    Table  4  it  is  witnessed  that  there  are  different  ranking of journals being the criteria of evaluation is different  in each evaluating tool and those are incomparable.  However,  impact factor is considered as an important criteria for getting  of extra points for the paper authored by the teacher.   (i). Updateness of the Journals: While going for calculating  
impact  factor  of  the  journal  on  the  basis  of  ICI,  it  was  
intended to calculate impact factor for 2016 but all the  
issues  of  many  journals  were  not  available.  More  so,   
calculating  impact  factor  of  journals  covered  in  the  
ICI  database  for  2015,  the  following  limitations  were  
observed:

- All Journals are categorised in 4 broad subject categories:  
(Science;  Social  Science;  Arts  &  Humanities;  and  
Multidisciplinary). 
- ‘Library  and  Information  Science’  subject  journals  are  
covered in Social Science Subject Category. 
- Total  UGC  approved  journals  in  subject  of  ‘Library  
and  Information  Science’  are  383  (from  42  different  
countries). 
- 93 LIS journals published from India out of 383 journals  
(24% of total LIS journals) are being covered in the list. 
The number also increases manifold from 15 journals to  93 (more than 6 times) from the frst list of journals published  by the UGC.  
Journal  titles  recommended  for  inclusion  either  by  the  Committee(s)  or  by  the  Universities  were  subjected  to  the  checklist developed by the Standing Committee on Notifcation  on Journals on the criteria26  as shown in Table 5. 
Journal  titles  that  scored  6  or  more  score  in  Science,  Social Sciences and Multidisciplinary category and 5 or more  score in Humanities on the checklist criteria were included in  the UGC-approved List of Journals.   
Journal titles recommended by the universities that did not  have ISSN number have not been included in UGC-approved  list of journals. Recommendations of various universities for  titles that were invalid or did not qualify the checklist have also  not been included in this list.  
7.  COnCLUSIOnS 
Whether, the UGC list of journals would yield qualitative  improvement in the scientifc literature or assist the authors in  gaining personal benefts is still unknown. The greatest limiting  factor  in  advancing  professional/technical  communication  at  the initial stage was restricting the publication to select three  citation databases to the list of journals by the UGC for career  progression of teachers in the universities and colleges. The  present study  proves that there are variations in the practices  followed by Indian LIS journals in regard reviewed/refereed/  coverage  in  abstracting  and  indexing  in  databases,  journal  ranking  and  updateness  of  journals.  There  is  a  need  for
