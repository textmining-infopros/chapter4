1. INTRODUCTION 
The recent developments of information technology  has brought of drastic changes in the information scenario  which  reflects  the  information  is  available  at  one’s  fingertip. The impact of internet and current technology  has  brought  a  great  change  in  the  library  services  and  access of information resources. The electronic information  resources  have  taken  a  major  role  in  the  academic  libraries as it enhances the learning, teaching and research  activities. For that reason the libraries are procuring more  number  of  online  resources  to  satisfy  the  varying  needs  of  students,  research  scholars  and  teachers.  The  faculty  and  research  scholars  are  predominantly  dependent  on  online  journals  for  teaching  and  research  work.  It  is  inevitable  to  make  a  study  on  the  different  aspects  of  e-journals  and  issues  relating  to  use  of  e-journals.  
Most of previous studies focus on use of E-journals  by  either  the  research  scholars  or  faculty  members.  However,  few  studies  focus  on  both  categories  such  as  research scholars and faculty members. Looking towards  the importance of the e-journals, the present study try to  analyse the use and awareness of online journals by the  faculty and research scholars of VSSUT and find out the  problems and constraints faced by the users for accessing  it  and  make  recommendations  for  its  proper  use.  This  study  is  probably  one  of  its  kinds  in  the  university.

5. METHODOLOGY 
The  author  has  adopted  the  Survey  method  for  which  a  structured  questionnaire  was  designed  and  distributed  among  the  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  in  different  departments  of  Veer  Surendra  Sai  University  of  Technology.  Some  questionnaires  were  personally distributed and some were sent through e-mail  to  the  faculty  members  and  research  scholars.  Personal  interviews were conducted wherever required. Total 148  questionnaires  were  distributed  and  115  questionnaires  have  collected  giving  a  response  rate  of  77.7%.  
6. DATA ANALYSIS  &  INTERPRETATION  
Out of 148 questionnaires, 115 filled in questionnaires  received from 14 Departments of VSSUT. The questionnaires  were  edited  as  per  the  requirement.  
In  2016,  the  E-ShodhSindhu  consortium  formed  by  merging of three consortiums such as: UGC- Infonet Digital  Library  Consortium,  INDEST-AICTE  consortium  and  NLIST by MHRD. The author has conducted an interview  includes  some  faculty  and  research  scholars  regarding  the knowledge of  e-ShodhSindhu consortium and found  that there is a very meager number of respondents having  knowledge  about  this  consortium,  for  which  the  author  reframed  the  questionnaire  with  former  consortium  like

UGC  Infonet  consortium  and  INDEST  consortium.  The  data collected from the respondents through questionnaire  was  tabulated  and  analysed  in  Fig.  1.  
6.1. Awareness  of  E-journals 
Due  to  changing  pattern  of  research,  the  research  community  need  intellectual  thought  and  information  collection  for  their  area  of  research.  E-Journals  have  become major resource for the researcher doing scholarly  research.  For  this,  libraries  are  acquiring  a  number  of  e-journals to fullfil their user need for research work and  ultimately  development  of  the  Institution.  It  is  utmost  important  that  whether  the  users  are  aware  about  the  e-journals  subscribed  by  their  libraries. 
Table  1  shows  that  98.21%  faculty  members  and  100%  research  scholars  were  aware  of  e-journals

reflects  that  a  majority  of  faculty  and  research  scholars  are  aware  of  electronic  journals  and  online  database  procured  by  their  library. 
6.2. Frequency  of  use  of  E-journals 
The  respondents  were  asked  regarding  frequency  of  access  of  e-journals.  Table  3  clearly  indicates  that,  most  of  the  research  scholars  (54.23%)  were  accessing  e-journals daily in comparison to faculty, i.e., (51.78%).  The  analysed  data  reveals  that  majority  of  faculty  and  research  scholars  were  using  the  e-journals  on  daily  basis.  The  remaining  26.78%  of  faculty  and  28.81%  research scholars were using e-journals on weekly basis,

6.3. Purpose  of  using  E-journals 
The  purpose  of  accessing  e-journals  among  the  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  in  VSSUT  is  as  shown  in  Table  4.  It  is  evident  from  above  table  that,  highest respondents i.e. 73.21% of faculty and 83.05% of  research scholars were using e-journals for research work.  It  reflects  that  the  e-journals  subscribed  by  the  Library  are effectively used for research work of the university.  Among  the  respondents  67.85%  faculty  members  and  76.27% of research scholars used e-journals for Writing  articles and Conference paper, followed by 55.35% faculty  and  52.54%  research  scholars  used  for  updating  their  
database subscribed by their library. Table 1 and Table 2  subject  information.  Whereas  42.85%  faculty  and  least

6.9. Consortia Approach  for Accessing  E-journals 
Due  to  serials  crises,  most  of  the  university  or  Institution libraries have been discontinuing the subscription  of e-journals. For this reason ‘Consortium’ approach is rise  up  and  providing  a  large  array  of  e-journals  in  various  disciplines  to  fulfil  the  information  need  of  different  community. In 2016, the e-Sodh Sindu consortium formed  with  merging  of  3  existing  consortiums  such  as  UGC- Infonet,  INDEST  and  NLIST.  In  the  present  study  the  respondents having insufficient knowledge about e-Sodh  Sindu  consortium,  for  which  the  question  reframed  as  earlier  consortiums. 
Table  10  reveals  that,  UGC-Infonet  consortium  is  most  familiar  among  faculty  members  (85.71%)  and  research  scholars  (74.57%)  followed  by  INDEST  consortium  as  62.5%  of  faculty  members  and  62.71%  of  research  scholars.  Only  3.57%  of  faculty  members

8. RECOMMENDATIONS 
Based  on  the  findings,  the  study  recommends  the  following: 
(a) Awareness  regarding  use  of  e-journals  should  be  
developed to achieve current information for academic  
and research purpose. Information regarding available  
e-journals  should  be  updated  in  the  library  website  
on  regular  interval  and  provide  information  about  
consortium  subscription 
(b) The  installation  of  computer  terminals  should  be  
increased  in  the  Department  and  central  library  for  
accessing  e-journals  effectively  and  efficiently (c) High  speed  internet  connection  should  be  provided  
for  quick  access  of  full  text  e-journals  
(d) The  study  clearly  indicates  that  the  subscription  of  
online  journals  should  be  increased  to  fullfil  the  
user  needs 
(e) The  library  professionals  should  be  trained  and  
skilled who will provide awareness to the users for  
accessing  of  e-journals  
(f) It is essential that the Central Library should conduct  
hands  on  training  and  orientation  programme  for  
the  research  scholars  and  faculty  members  for  the  
optimum  use  of  online  journals 
(g) Remote  access  to  all  the  e-resources  should  be  
provided  by  the  library 
use  it  for  their  research  work.  
The  study  reveals  that  the  faculty  members  and  research  scholars  of  VSSUT  mostly  rely  on  e-journals  for  research  purpose  and  publishing  articles.  They  are  using  the  available  e-journals  satisfactorily.  The  library  professionals  tried  their  best  for  promotion,  assistance  and  guidance  in  accessing  e-journals.  The  increase  in  e-journals subscription indicates that the library has gone  drastic changes in e-journals collection and services. The  library has to employ different strategies for effective use  of  available  online  resources.  The  Central  Library  also  develops the infrastructural facility for accessing online  journals. The Central Library has to conduct the workshops  and  training  programme  for  the  best  use  of  e-journals.
